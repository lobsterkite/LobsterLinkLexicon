<br>
An Enhancement Shaman is an integral part of any melee group. Besides offering substantial personal DPS, an Enhancement Shaman brings group specific buffs through talents beyond those offered by a Resto Shaman. These include Unleashed Rage (an on-crit proc for 10% additional melee AP), Strength of Earth (+97 STR) Windfury (20% proc instant attack with extra AP), and Grace of Air (+88 AGI). Enhancement shamans are equally useful in a main tank group, offering increased dodge and armor, or increased threat generation.<br>
<br>
An Enhancement Shaman is not a melee healer. While many will have a resto sub-spec and can certainly help top off a group after an AoE or step in to prevent an emergency, their gear's focus on melee stats makes them unsuitable  healers in the endgame. An Enhancement Shaman should be dedicated to DPS, maximizing Unleashed Rage and totem coverage for his group.<br>
<br>
Enhacement Shaman have four sources of damage:<ul><li>Windfury, a weapon imbue that gives the shaman a 20% proc of two instant attacks with a substantial AP bonus</li>
<li>Stormstrike, a 10s cooldown instant attack with both weapons</li>
<li>Elemental Shocks, shared cooldown instant elemental damage offering stealth prevention, snaring or interruption</li>
<li>Fire Totems, pulsed direct or AoE fire damage</li>
</ul>The vast majority (75-80%) of a shaman's damage comes from autoattack and Windfury. Shamans also have three on-crit procs: the aforementioned UR, Flurry (3 attacks at +30% speed) and a special clearcasting state for shocks.<br>
<br>
Enhancement shaman are highly gear dependent, perhaps more so than any other DPS class. The 'skill' required to be effective at the class manifests in proper gear selection prior to combat; during combat the amount of 'skill' to produce respectable DPS consists mainly of staying in contact with the mob and maintaining totem coverage. This gives an Enhancement Shaman a great deal of latitude while DPSing since there are a limited number of actions that we can perform while waiting on Stormstrike and Shock cooldowns, allowing many possible global cooldowns to be used for purging mobs or removing poison/disease debuffs with no interruption of the DPS cycle.<br>

<u><b><font size="+2">1. Major Abilities</font></b></u><br>
<u><b><font size="+1">1.1 Windfury Weapon</font></b></u><br>
Windfury Weapon was corrected in the 2.1 patch link Windfury on the main and off hands. At some point prior to that, a hidden/internal 3 second cooldown had been added to Windfury Weapon. As a result, OH procs now (correctly) trigger the cooldown on the MH. Despite this set back to shaman DPS (net loss of about 10-15% DPS for enhancement shaman), Windfury Weapon is <b>still</b> the best weapon imbue to use – former CM Tseric has stated that the devs have no plans to scale the other weapon buffs to match Windfury. [footnote]http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=102731970&amp;pageNo=1&amp;sid=1#0[/footnote]<br>
<br>
<u><b><font size="+1">1.1.1 Weapon Speed Interaction</font></b></u><br>
Weapon Speeds play an important role in maximizing DPS from Windfury procs. The goal is to chain WF procs every 3 seconds, as soon as each cooldown ends. Both the OH and the MH need to be as slow as possible to achieve this(they do not need to be matched in speed, just as slow as you can get it). The idea is to reduce the number of swings made during the time that windfury is on cooldown. Since the cooldown is 3 seconds, weapons speeds are preferred to be close to that speed, generally this means 2.6 - 2.8 under current itemization. The idea is that a faster weapon would proc a WF, and then strike again within the cooldown window, which means that windfury would exit cooldown and your weapon would still be on some significant portion of its swing timer, unable to proc another WF. <br>
<br>
Many shaman will correctly use a slow MH weapon but use a fast OH such as a dagger, generally because its easier to find fast OHs than slow ones. This combination however means that your OH is much more likely to be the first one to hit outside of a WF cooldown and will "steal" the potential chance to proc, placing your main hand on lockdown. In order to maximize the potential for MH procs the OH needs to be as slow as possible.<br>
<br>
The image below <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302183851/http://elitistjerks.com/471640-post2280.html" target="_blank">courtesy of Yo!</a> illustrates this principle. You can see that as the MH and OH approach 2.6 speed (arbitrarily chosen as the cut off point for the scale) that the number of WF procs lost to the OH become lower, at around a 45% predicted loss rate. A fast OH with a slow MH combination has  a higher rate of loss to the OH, at nearly 55%.<br>

<br>
<u><b><font size="+1">1.1.2 Windfury Proc Rate</font></b></u><br>
When you are wielding a two handed weapon, or are using a shield, your chance to proc windfury on any landed attack outside the 3-second cooldown is 20%. When you dual wield weapons, the chance on each landed attack <b>outside</b> the 3-second cooldown is approximatedly 36%, if and only if both weapons are imbued with Windfury. (Original findings were posted on the WoW forums by Disquette, the thread has been removed from the official archives)<br>
<br>
Analysis of the combat log shows that if you sum all hits, the proc rate while DWing is 20%, but that includes hits you make while inside the 3 second cooldown, which cannot actually proc WF. When you remove the ineligible hits the observed proc rate from the eligible hits becomes 36%.<br>
<br>
<u><b><font size="+1">1.1.3 Can Windfury Totem avoid the cooldown problem?</font></b></u><br>
While you may ~think~ it will help you avoid the WF cooldown problem, the totem isn't providing anywhere near the benefit you'll get from the weapon imbue. <br>
WF Totem has the following issues: no elemental weapons bonus (40% multiple), only one extra attack (200% multiple), lesser AP bonus (scalar). Each MH WF Totem hit would be 100% extra damage or so compared to a normal attack, and has only one chance of proc'ing flurry, any weapon procs, and UR. Each MH WF imbue hit would be 280% extra damage or so compare to a normal attack, and has 2 chances of proc'ing those things.<br>
In a very very simplified way of looking at it, you'd have to proc MH WF 2.8 as many times using the totem as you do using the imbue, for it to be worth it.<br>

<u><b><font size="+1">1.4 Elemental Shocks</font></b></u><br>
There are 2 possible rotations that an Enhancement shaman can use. Initially most shaman will assume that with the Stormstrike nature damage bonus Earth Shock spam will yield more DPS. However, Earth Shock is a binary spell and is susceptible to full resists, whereas Flame Shock has no binary component and will benefit from partial resist rates due to spell hit. Additionally, Flame Shock benefits from Curse of Elements and the Improved Scorch Debuff, while Earth Shock is only amplified by Stormstrike. (Both benefit from Misery)<br>
<br>
In determining the ideal rotation, let us assume a sandbox environment with no crits and no resists to worry about. The mob will be fully raid debuffed with CoE and Malediction, Misery, and Improved Scorch Debuff. Assume that Earth Shock always has the benefit of Stormstrike, and that the Enhance Shaman in question has 2500 Attack Power, yielding 750 spell damage (approximate) with the Mental Quickness talent. Earth Shock has a spell damage coefficient of 0.42 and Flame Shock has a coefficient of 0.67. <br>
<br>
<b>Earth Shock Spam</b><br>
This is a 6 second cycle.<br>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302183851im_/http://elitistjerks.com/cgi-bin/mathtex.cgi?%5Cfrac%20%7B0.42%20%5Ctimes%20750%20+%20675%7D%7B6%7D%20%5Ctimes%201.26%20=%20207.9" alt="\frac {0.42 \times 750 + 675}{6} \times 1.26 = 207.9"><br>
<br>
<b>Flame - Earth Rotation</b><br>
This is a 12 second cycle that begins with Flame Shock.<br>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302183851im_/http://elitistjerks.com/cgi-bin/mathtex.cgi?%5Cleft%20(%5Cfrac%7B0.67%20%5Ctimes%20750%20+%20797%7D%7B12%7D%20%5Ctimes%201.36%5Cright)%20+%20%5Cleft%20(%5Cfrac%20%7B0.42%20%5Ctimes%20750%20+%20675%7D%7B12%7D%20%5Ctimes%201.26%20%5Cright%20)%20=%20355.2" alt="\left (\frac{0.67 \times 750 + 797}{12} \times 1.36\right) + \left (\frac {0.42 \times 750 + 675}{12} \times 1.26 \right ) = 355.2"><br>
<br>
While a single earth shock in 6 seconds is worth more than a single flame shock that is allowed to go its full 12 second DoT, the combination of the two in a single, 12 second rotation, provides superior DPS. <br>
<br>
Finally as a third point of comparison, let us compare Earth Shock to Flame Shock directly, using only 6 seconds of the DoT component of Flame Shock. Earth Shock was computed above as providing 207.9 DPS every 6 seconds.<br>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302183851im_/http://elitistjerks.com/cgi-bin/mathtex.cgi?%5Cfrac%20%7B0.67%20%5Ctimes%20750%20+%20(377%20+%200.5(420))%7D%7B6%7D%20%5Ctimes%201.36%20=%20246.9" alt="\frac {0.67 \times 750 + (377 + 0.5(420))}{6} \times 1.36 = 246.9"><br>
Therefore, you can see that Flame Shock over a 6 second period provides more DPS than Earth Shock. <br>

<u><b><font size="+1">2.2 The Myth of Elemental Devastation</font></b></u><br>
One of the more prevalent suggestions is that Enhance Shaman should optimize their DPS by speccing into Elemental for a 5 second shock cooldown, 5% increased shock damage, and of course the Elemental Devastation Talent, typically achieved by removing points from Mental Quickness and/or Improved Weapon Totems for an 18/43/0 build.<br>
<br>
The logic of this build is fundamentally flawed. A properly geared Enhancement Shaman will have <u>at most</u> a 6% spell crit rate from Intellect. Under perfect conditions this will amount to a 1% crit gain from Elemental Devastation. Under not-so-perfect conditions, this talent would be negligible and worthless to an Enhancement shaman.<br>
The probability of getting 2 crit shocks in a row at 6% spell crit, in order to sustain the extra melee crit bonus of Elemental Devastation, is 1-(1- 0.6)^2 = 0.118. That's about 12% uptime of an extra 1% crit from 3 talent points.<br>
<br>
<u><b><font size="+2">3. Itemizing an Enhancement Shaman</font></b></u><br>
<u><b><font size="+1">3.1 Enhancement Points (EP) Stat Weight System</font></b></u><br>
Extensive modeling, simulation, and empirical testing by Disquette, Pater, Tornhoof, and Yo! have led to the development of a system for determining the items which produce the highest DPS in a raid environment. The <b>Enhancement Points</b> (<b>EP</b>) system assigns weights or scores to each stat point. These EP weights can then be used by hand or in automated programs such as Enhancer, Pawn, LootRank and Thottbot to score items. Today, the best tool for determining these weights is to use the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302183851/http://theorycraft.narod.ru/" target="_blank">Crazy Shaman's DPS &amp; EP Calculator</a> produced by forums member Yo! For those who cannot run the simulator, are unwilling to do the legwork, or just want to check their own numbers, the following sets of EP values are provided: <br>
<br>
<b>Entry Raid (T4) EP Values</b><br>
If you have just hit level 70 or have been running some heroics for a while but have not started raiding KZ and 25 mans yet, your EP stat weights will be significantly different from shamans wearing high-end gear. Use these values until you have progressed into SSC/TK beyond the first 1-2 bosses. These values were arrived at using simulation of a shaman wearing best of slot quest and instance blues, with some heroic loot. Buffs were limited to what a 10 man raid would normally have - no Kings, no LotP, no flasks, and assumed lower quality gems and enchants.<br>
<br>
Attack Power = 1 EP<br>
Strength = 2 EP<br>
Agility = 1.74 EP<br>
Crit Rating = 1.97 EP<br>
Hit Rating = 1.34 EP (explanation below at VIII.4 Itemization - Hit Rating)<br>
Haste Rating = 1.28 EP (explanation below at VIII.3 Itemization - Haste Rating)<br>
Armor Penetration = 0.22 EP<br>
Expertise Rating = see the Expertise section below for an explanation<br>
<br>
<b>Middle Raid (T5) EP Values</b><br>
These values are a generally agreed-upon set produced by the average of the most reliable closed-form model and iterative simulations across the breadth of shaman gearing possibilities. They rapidly become less accurate as you accumulate more pieces of T5-level gear. As such, using Yo's simulator to obtain individualized EP numbers is strongly advised. Note that Blessing of Kings increases the contribution of Strength and Agility by 10% and thus their EPs when it is active.<br>
<br>
Attack Power = 1 EP<br>
Strength = 2 EP (2.2 EP with Blessing of Kings)<br>
Agility = 1.8 EP (2 EP with Blessing of Kings)<br>
Crit Rating = 2 EP<br>
Hit Rating = 1.4 EP (explanation below at VIII.4 Itemization - Hit Rating)<br>
Haste Rating = 1.48 EP (explanation below at VIII.3 Itemization - Haste Rating)<br>
Armor Penetration = 0.28 EP<br>
Expertise Rating = see the Expertise section below for an explanation<br>
<br>
<b>High Raid (T6) EP Values</b><br>
These values were contributed by forum member Sebudai based on an end-game T6 gear set, essentially with best-in-slot items for all slots. These should be viewed as a rough estimate for shaman entering T6 content, and include Blessing of Kings.<br>
Strength = 2.2 EP <br>
Agility = 1.69 EP <br>
Crit Rating = 1.74 EP<br>
Hit Rating = 1.69<br>
Haste Rating = 1.82<br>
Armor Penetration = 0.35 EP<br>
Expertise Rating = 3.18 (Yo's Simulator recently changed to give EP weights to Expertise Rating)<br>
<br>
<b>Weapon DPS EP Values</b><br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302183851/http://elitistjerks.com/516315-post3989.html" target="_blank">Pitbuller</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302183851/http://elitistjerks.com/517340-post4029.html" target="_blank">Rob</a> have shown that it is possible to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302183851/http://elitistjerks.com/517715-post4039.html" target="_blank">convert weapon DPS</a> into EP values. This is useful to compute the total EP of a weapon in order to compare two weapons, as seen in this post (link to where you or someone compared Netherbane to MG Cleaver). The following values are only valid for a 2.6 speed weapon. EP would need to be recalculated for any other speeds. These are presented here because 2.6 is the most common speed for weapons.<br>
<br>
1 MH DPS = 9.03 EP<br>
1 OH DPS = 3.70 EP<br>
<br>
<font color="Red">Careful!</font> Only use these numbers for comparing weapons; do not use them for drawing other conclusions. For example, these numbers do not mean that 9 AP = 1 DPS for enhancement shamans. Why? Note the distinction between <b>EP</b> and <b>AP</b>. 9 AP will in fact increase your DPS by more than 1; just as 1 weapon DPS will increase your overall DPS by more than 1. To understand why, imagine that 1 weapon DPS increases your DPS by exactly 1 after glances, misses, dodges, and crits are accounted for. Now throw in Flurry, WF procs, and Stormstrike and realize that the weapon is hitting more often than the tooltip says it is, so you gain more DPS from the nominal weapon DPS.<br>
<u><b><font size="+1">3.1.1 Using EP - Examples</font></b></u><br>
First, you must make a decision whether or not to assume that you will have Blessing of Kings. As a general rule, Salvation and Might are superior buffs, so you can only expect Kings in a 25-man scenario. In this example, we’re comparing 25-man gear, so we’ll assume Blessing of Kings is active and use the T5 EP Values. Then, it’s a simple matter of looking at the stats available on each item, multiplying them by their attack power equivalence, and adding them all up:<br>
<br>
<a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302183851/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=30919"><span  ><span class="purplename">[Valestalker Girdle]</span></span></a><br>
+27 Agility (x 2 = 54)<br>
+25 Stamina<br>
+18 Intellect<br>
Equip: Improves haste rating by 36 (x 1.4 = 50.4)<br>
Equip: Increases attack power by 76 (x 1 = 76)<br>
Total: 180.4 EP<br>
<br>
<a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302183851/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=30068"><span  ><span class="purplename">[Girdle of the Tidal Call]</span></span></a><br>
+35 Strength (x 2.2 = 77)<br>
+30 Stamina<br>
+20 Intellect<br>
Equip: Improves critical strike rating by 33 (x 2 = 66)<br>
Total: 143 EP<br>
<br>
So, Valestalker Girdle (180.4 EP) is a larger increase to melee DPS than Girdle of Tidal Call (143 EP); for our purposes, we’ll say that makes it a better item. Note that values are not assigned here to Stamina or Intellect; these stats do carry some value for raiding enhancement shamans, but any assignment of value to them would be arbitrary and is for each individual shaman to decide on her own.<br>
<br>
Now lets compare two weapons using the weapon EP values.<br>
<a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302183851/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=31965"><span  ><span class="purplename">[Merciless Gladiator's Cleaver]</span></span></a><br>
97.5 DPS (MH: x9.03 = 880.4) (OH: x3.70 = 360.75)<br>
+27 Stamina<br>
Equip: Improves hit rating by 10. (x1.4 = 14)<br>
Equip: Improves critical strike rating by 19. (x2 = 38)<br>
Equip: Improves your resilience rating by 12.<br>
Equip: Increases attack power by 30. (x1 = 30)<br>
Total MH EP = 962.4<br>
Total OH EP = 442.75<br>
<br>
<a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302183851/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=29924"><span  ><span class="purplename">[Netherbane]</span></span></a><br>
96.5 DPS (MH: x9.03 = 871.4) (OH: x3.7 = 357)<br>
+25 Agility (x2 = 50)<br>
+21 Stamina<br>
Equip: Increases attack power by 40. (x1 = 40)<br>
Total MH EP = 961.4<br>
Total OH EP = 447.05<br>
<br>
Comparing the two weapons we can see that the difference in the MH for each weapon is relatively minor with a 1 EP difference, but in the OH the Netherbane performs better with a 5 EP difference.<br>
<br>
<u><b><font size="+1">3.1.2 Hit Rating</font></b></u><br>
Hit Rating is a subject of much anxiety among Enhancement Shaman. Hit Rating is valuable, but beyond hit capping your special attacks it provides less benefit per point to our damage than an equivalent item budget amount of AP, Crit, Haste, or Expertise.<br>
<br>
Since we can get a large quantity of +Hit from talents (9%), our special attacks (windfury and stormstrike) are already hit capped. All the extra +Hit rating on your gear is going toward improving white damage only, which typically comprises between 40%-50% of your total damage. When you consider the itemization costs of hit rating compared to crit rating and AP, which directly impact 90% of a shaman's total damage, you can see why hit rating is given lower precedence. Take the talents to hit cap your specials, any hit rating on gear after that is icing on the cake.<br>
<br>
A common misconception is that you "have to hit before you can crit." This is a fallacy and illustrates a misunderstanding of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302183851/http://www.wowinsider.com/2007/03/24/attack-tables-and-you/" target="_blank">attack table</a>. (Note that this is in reference to white damage which uses a single roll system.) Your Hit Rating will not impact your Crit Rate in any way. <br>
<br>
A second misconception is that a miss is a "missed opportunity for a WF proc" and that more Hit Rating will generate more WF procs. This misconception is generated from the flawed assumption that all swings are possible WF procs. However only swings that are outside of the WF cooldown are eligible to proc WF. A good portion of your autoattack hits will never be capable of producing WF procs. A 5 minute fight with no flurry would see 115 white swings with a 2.6 speed weapon. A Shaman might look at that and think that 0.36 * 115 = 41 possible WF procs, but that is incorrect since each successful proc locks out 1-2 hits that follow, shrinking the pool of actual eligible hits. It is actually quite difficult to calculate the number of attacks that you *should* have producing WF in a given amount of time, and that is why we rely on simulators to generate the EP value of Hit Rating.  <br>
<br>
<font color="red"><b>There is no magic value of +Hit that an Enhance Shaman needs</b></font> We need as much of every stat as we can get, but hit rating is just less important than the others. That does not mean that the goal is to have low hit rating either though. Rogues and Warriors require large amounts of +Hit to be effective because of their rage and combo point systems, and because they do not have talents that can hit cap their specials before considering hit on gear. Enhance shaman have no such feedback system and are able to hit cap specials through talents - therefore, hit rating above and beyond your talents is great to have, but is not a necessity. <br>
<br>
<u><b><font size="+1">3.1.3 Haste Rating </font></b></u><br>
Haste Rating will directly increase the contribution of white swings to your DPS - 1% Haste will generate 1% more auto attack DPS. Prior to patch 2.2 Haste Rating became the superior stat, but the 2.3 patch reduced its EP value closer to that of Hit Rating. <br>
<br>
Modeling at one time indicated weapons hasted between 1.51 and 1.41 speed will actually experience a sharp decrease in potential Windfury DPS. The range of 1.51- 1.41 speed was believed to cause the main hand to always finish a swing just before the end of a WF cooldown, making you wait longer for the next eligible swing that can proc WF. If hasted in this period for a long duration, you could expect WF DPS contribution to decrease. However, you'll also experience many more white swings during that time, and so the loss of potential WF procs should be offset by the increased white DPS. <b>It is no longer believed that the 1.5 to 1.4 hasted speed will actually cause any decrease in DPS - you should notice an overall increase.</b><br>
<br>
There is no need to worry about the 1.51 - 1.41 hasted weapon range. The original claims about the supposed DPS loss had done no empirical or simulated testing to back up their modeling. More recent testing has indicated that whatever potential WF DPS is lost because of swing timer issues is more than made up for by the gigantic leap in autoattack DPS.<br>
<br>
<u><b><font size="+1">3.1.4 Intellect and Mp5</font></b></u><br>
Intellect on gear is not a significant source of DPS contribution. Pater has a short writeup exploring this  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302183851/http://elitistjerks.com/394080-post28.html" target="_blank"><i>here</i></a>.<br>
Mp5 is almost universally agreed to be a hunter stat that is wasted on enhance shaman gear. Note that the more you decide to contribute in a "hybrid" manner (healing to top off yourself and others) the mana pool will become slightly more important, but not such that you should sacrifice significant DPS upgrades to hold on to 15 Int on another item. The combination of Judgment of Wisdom and Shamanistic Rage (use it early, use it often) should prevent you from running out of mana even in full rogue leather gear - unless you're having to spot heal.<br>
<br>
<u><b><font size="+1">3.1.5 Expertise Rating</font></b></u><br>
Patch 2.3 will change all weapon skill rating into weapon expertise rating, which converts into Expertise skill at a rate of 3.95 expertise rating:1 Expertise, and reduces the chance for your target to dodge and parry by 0.25% per point of Expertise. <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302183851/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=30055"><span  ><span class="purplename">[Shoulderpads of the Stranger]</span></span></a>, which used to provide 10 dagger skill rating, will now provide 10 expertise rating (all weapons).<br>
<br>
The parry reduction element of Expertise will have only marginal use in raid settings: mobs cannot parry attacks made from behind. Many bosses randomly turn to cast attacks and can parry while turning, but this possibility is  too random to value significantly. Unlike parry, mobs can dodge attacks from behind and Expertise is currently the only way to reduce the number of dodges. The dodge reduction element of Expertise will vary from encounter to encounter: it will be useless against bosses that are constantly casting (e.g. Shade of Aran, High Astromancer Solarian, Reliquary of Souls) because mobs cannot dodge while casting, but useful against mobs that do not cast or only cast instant spells. Expertise has been shown to affect yellow damage as well as white damage, so under the second circumstance it is actually more useful than hit rating for enhancement shamans.<br>
<br>
We still don't know how Expertise's dodge and parry reduction affect the one-roll white attack table. For now, the community is assuming that it converts dodges and parries into hits that do not have a chance to crit. On the other hand, we are now confident that Expertise will allow yellow attacks to crit, since they are resolved through a two-roll system. Thus, we will estimate expertise rating to be similar to the weight of hit rating, with some exceptions.<br>
<br>
First, expertise rating is only useful in chunks, because there is no concept of having 2.5 Expertise - the Skill values are all rounded down to whole integers. To get around this, you first need to sum up the expertise rating across all your items, divide by 3.95, take the floor, and multiply by 3.95 again. This gives you a "white hit rating" equivalency. Note that this makes expertise rating EP <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302183851/http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Discontinuity.html" target="_blank"><i>discontinuous</i></a>. One expertise rating may be worth 0 EP because it is not enough to give you an extra skill point -- e.g. you go from 14 expertise rating to 15 expertise rating -- while a jump of two expertise rating at the same point may have a surprisingly high EP -- e.g. you go from 14 expertise rating to 16 and thus 0.75% dodge reduction to 1.00% dodge reduction.<br>
<br>
Next, we must account for the fact that Expertise, unlike hit rating, also effects the yellow damage from special attacks in addition to the white damage from auto-attacks. To correct for this, you need to multiply by the ratio of melee damage to white damage, or (Yellow % of damage + White % of damage)/(White % of damage). Also, because white crit rate as a percentage of landed swings decreases as hit rate goes up, but with the two-roll system, yellow crit rate stays constant, we must adjust for that. Finally, we must multiply by the EP of 1 hit rating, to convert our "hit rating" equivalency into EP.<br>
<br>
Our final expertise calculation is:<br>
EP = <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302183851im_/http://elitistjerks.com/cgi-bin/mathtex.cgi?%20%5Clfloor%20%5Cfrac%20%7B%5Csum%20%7B%5Ctext%20Expertise%7D%7D%7B3.95%7D%20%5Crfloor%20%5Ctimes%203.95%20%5Ctimes%20%5Cfrac%20%7B%5Ctext%20%7BYellow%5C%%7D%20%5Ctimes%20(1%20+%20%5Ctext%7BCrit%5C%%7D)%20+%20%5Ctext%7BWhite%5C%%7D%7D%7B%5Ctext%20%7BWhite%5C%%7D%7D%20%5Ctimes%20%5Ctext%20%7BHit%20EP%7D%20" alt=" \lfloor \frac {\sum {\text Expertise}}{3.95} \rfloor \times 3.95 \times \frac {\text {Yellow\%} \times (1 + \text{Crit\%}) + \text{White\%}}{\text {White\%}} \times \text {Hit EP} "><br>
<br>
Example Calculation:<br>
Assume that we are examining a new piece of gear that will bring our total Expertise Rating to 17, Hit EP is 1.4, Crit% is 30%, White% of DPS is 50%, Yellow% of DPS is 40% and the remaining 10% is shocks and searing totem.<br>

<u><b><font size="+1">3.2 Weapons</font></b></u><br>
Optimizing enhancement shaman DPS requires running two slow weapons with Windfury Weapon on both weapons.<br>
<br>
The best way to choose between multiple items in the same slot is to run Yo's simulator, once for each item, using the stats that you would have with that item equipped. <b>Do not post asking which weapon is best: find out for yourself by running the sim.</b> That said, here are some general guidelines.<br>
<br>
A frequently asked question is how to wield weapons with differing speeds but similar DPS values, such as using a Rising Tide and a Syphon - is it better to put one weapon in the main/off hand over the other? Simulation results indicate that it makes little difference which hand the slower weapon is wielded in. It appears that in general, a 2.x/2.y = 2.y/2.x.<br>

Orcs should prioritize axes for the +5 Expertise racial bonus. This is believed to be applied per hand non stacking, so an axe/mace combo only applies expertise to the axe, and an axe/axe combo would apply 5 Expertise to each hand.<br>
<br>
The differences in DPS within these "tiers" are relatively minor. Which weapon is best for you, or which weapon to mainhand and which weapon to offhand, can <b>only</b> be found by using the simulator with your stats, and no general conclusions can be drawn.<br>
<br>
<u><b><font size="+1">3.2.2Off Hand</font></b></u><br>
OH itemization is fairly poor early on, but recent changes in patch 2.3 have added several new options in KZ and ZA that will help fill the gaps. If you are not yet raiding, the best choices for OH in a WF/WF setup is a 2.6 speed Gladiator weapon from Arenas, a crafted Runic Hammer (2.4 speed) or a blue one-hand weapon available in several heroic instances (Auchenai Crypts last boss drops a 2.6 speed one-hand axe). Failing that, get yourself a green 2.6 speed off the Auction House. <br>
<br>

This comes at the cost of reduced Windfury procs, reduced Stormstrike damage, and a reduction in Flurry uptime.

<u><b><font size="+1">3.2.3 TwoHand Viability</font></b></u><br>
2H weapons are strictly inferior for PvE DPS situations, and reasonably poor for PvP as well. Talents and mechanics of shaman DPS at lvl 70 are built around DW. 9% +Hit while DWing through a 0/42/19 build allows all special attacks to be hit capped through talents alone, while a 2H will only receive 3% of the hit benefit. DW also scales better with AP. 2h effectively gains (1.0 * 0.95 hit rate) = 0.95 from AP and DW gains (1.5 * 0.74 hit rate) = 1.11 from AP. The more +hit you have (until we reach cap) the greater the difference between the two is. At a certain point (easily reached when raid buffed), this difference in gain from AP will outweigh the bonus base DPS of a 2H weapon over similar ilevel 1H weapons. <br>
<br>
The second largest benefit you bring to your group is Unleashed Rage, and your Flurry and UR uptime will take a large hit from using a 2H, as strings of dodge/miss/non crits become compounded by a single, slower swing time. Threat concerns are even more problematic with a 2H because of  large WF procs, requiring that you heavily pad your threat against a tank. <br>
<br>
And finally, as mentioned in the Windfury Proc section, DW with WF on both weapons results in an increased chance to proc WF off either hand (36%). 2H weapons will not benefit from that increased proc rate.<br>
<br>
To illustrate:<br>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302183851im_/http://i48.photobucket.com/albums/f230/x24702/Screenshot-1.png" border="0" alt=""><br>
Note the differences here. 2H has a higher flurry uptime because DWing will consume the 3 charges faster, but the Uptime for UR is much higher for DW than 2H, leading to greater group synergy.<br>

B3: Stonebreaker EP to white damage = Percent_of_white_Swings * Stonebreaker * (1 - MissRate)<br>
<br>
Physical Damage breakdown:<br>
Assuming two 2.6 speed weapons, flurried to 2.0 speed, means you get around 10 white swings per SS cooldown. 40% of those swings will be WF, meaning 10 white swings, 2 SS swings, 4.8 WF swings. 10+2+4.8 = 16.8<br>
Percent_of_WF_Swings = 4.8/16.8 = 0.286<br>
Percent_of_SS_Swings = 2/16.8 = 0.119<br>
Percent_of_white_Swings = 10/16.8 = 0.595<br>
(This breakdown is conservatively in favor of the Astral Winds Totem. Many WWS parses from raids show the balance slightly shifted away from WF towards white swings)<br>
<br>
A: 32<br>
B1: 44<br>
B2: 13<br>
B3: 65 * (1 - Missrate)<br>
<br>
A = Stonebreaker_Uptime * (B1 + B2 + B3).<br>
32 = Uptime * (44 + 13 + [ 65 * (1 - Missrate) ]<br>
Let Missrate = 19%<br>
Then Uptime = 29%<br>
<br>
As miss rate decreases, so does the required uptime to break even. An enhancement shaman with +9% hit from talents and no hit rating on gear would see a 19% miss rate against boss mobs, resulting in a required uptime of 29%.<br>
Changing some values for more hit gear, we find that even if your miss rate is better than 2% the required uptime is 26.4%. This gives us a fairly good window of possible required uptimes for the Stonebreaker buff over a wide variety of gear, with a good conservative estimate being 30%.<br>
<br>
Now what does it take to achieve a 30% uptime? Here’s a simplified formula for determining this.<br>
<br>
(Seconds per Shock) = (Stonebreaker proc chance) * (1-Spell miss rate) * (Stonebreaker duration) * (1/Stonebreaker Uptime)<br>
<br>
(Seconds per Shock) = (0.50)*(1-0.14)*(1/0.30) = 14.3<br>
<br>
This means that on average, a shock every 14.3 seconds is the minimum needed to maintain 30% uptime on the totem buff and thus make it come out ahead of the Astral Winds totem.<br>
<br>
Conclusion: The Stonebreaker totem should be superior to the Totem of Astral Winds on average if the shaman can shock at least once every 14 seconds. Note that Stonebreaker has a 10 second hidden cooldown.<br>

However, Mongoose/Executioner or double Executioner will not outperform the dps benefit of double Mongoose unless the Enhancement Shaman is geared with nearly unobtainable values of Armor Penetration. <br>
<br>
Executioner currently does not stack from multiple hands, each proc when DWing will simply refresh the buff. It is unknown if this is intended, since this deviates from how other weapon enchants function. Obviously the value of Executioner will increase as you gain more -Armor gear. At entry raid level a shaman will probably gain more from dual Mongoose enchants. At high T5 content and beyond, Executioner will become more valuable. <br>
<br>
Evidence suggests that Mongoose and Executioner have nearly the same uptime and PPM, around 40-45%<br>

<u><b><font size="+2">4 Enhancement Shaman in a group</font></b></u><br>
<u><b><font size="+1">4.1 How to choose totems</font></b></u><br>
In a 5-man party your DPS is generally limited by the threat that your tank can produce. The most efficient way to increase small party DPS is to provide the tank with more threat. Totems should be chosen that compliment the tank, rather than the rest of the party, even it if means only 1 player is receiving benefit from the totem. Priority of totems always goes to the tank in small groups.<br>
<br>
Warrior and Paladin tanks should always receive Windfury, unless they are severely under-geared and need the extra armor/dodge just to survive. Rationale for using GoA for a Warrior or Paladin tank should <b>never</b> be to provide crit. Feral druids that are tanking should always be given GoA. <br>
<br>
In a raid setting this becomes slightly more complicated as bastardized groups are thrown together. Recommendation is to follow this set of rules:<br>
<br>
Rule 1 - If you are ever in doubt about which Air totem should be used, your raid leader has probably failed to put together a complimentary group. Reference the <b>Group Compositions That Work</b> section for details on putting groups together. Encourage proper group compositions for maximum benefit to the raid. <br>
<br>
Rule 2 - If a DPS warrior is in your group, he needs Windfury for his rage feedback mechanism. Windfury provides a larger DPS gain to a DPS warrior than any other totem to any other class. <br>
<br>
Rule 3 - If you are in the Main Tank group, the warriors should be given Windfury unless it is a non-threat limited fight where survivability is more important. Prot Paladin tanks will benefit more from Wrath of Air and Feral Druids that are tanking should obviously receive Grace of Air.<br>
<br>
Rule 4 - If there is no Warrior, but 2 or more Combat Sword Rogues are in the group, they will benefit slightly more from Windfury from increased opportunities for Sword Spec procs, than from Grace of Air. <br>
<br>
Rule 5 - If your group has no warrior, and 2 or more Feral Druids or Hunters, Grace of Air is the totem of choice.<br>
<br>
<u><b><font size="+1">4.1.1 Totem Twisting</font></b></u><br>
Sometimes the best way to solve a conflict of interest in a group is to give everyone what they want. Note that Blizzard has stated that Totem Twisting is considered a bug, and plan to remove the ability to do this in a future patch. <br>
<br>
Windfury Totem places a 9 second buff on party member's weapons to imbue them with the extra attack mechanic. This can be manipulated to allow Grace of Air or Tranquil Air totems to be placed "simultaneously" with Windfury Totem. <br>
<br>
You'll most likely want a macro to do this if you so choose, and a mod to track the time remaining on the windfury buff. A common one looks like this:<br>
<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px; ">

				/castsequence reset=8 [combat] Windfury Totem, Grace of Air Totem
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</div>Totem Twisting has both its advocates and its detractors, it is not an agreed upon mechanic or strategy.<br>
<b>Pros:</b><ul><li>Party gains 88 Agility or extra threat reduction</li>
<li>Overall DPS of the party is increased</li>
</ul><b>Cons:</b><ul><li>The shaman increases time spent in global cooldown, impairing his ability to decurse or purge mobs.</li>
<li>The mana cost of refreshing 2 totems every 9 seconds while Stormstriking is roughly 14,000 mana every 2 minutes. This will limit the ability to use shocks, and requires very careful timing of Shamanistic Rage, may require JoW from a paladin, and definitely requires 5 points in Totemic Mastery.</li>
<li>Until you are very practiced with the technique you will find your attention devoted to watching the timers which means you will be less attentive to changes in the game environment</li>
<li>Latency or simply being late to refresh the Windfury totem will cause the Windfury buff to run off your party's weapons, which means they are losing opportunities for a Windfury proc.</li>
</ul><br>
<u><b><font size="+1">4.2 Managing your threat</font></b></u><br>
Enhance Shaman are severely threat capped - not as badly as a Ret Paladin, but worse than a DPS warrior. With no active threat reduction we rely on buffs, items, and strategy to reduce our threat. Methods to reduce your threat are listed below in order of Most to Least effective. Remember that threat reduction is multiplicative, not additive.<br>
<ul><li>Spirit Weapons - Enhancement talent that reduces melee threat by 30%. This is a staple talent for our spec. If you don't have this, you're walking the crazy line. Most effective since its always on and isn't reliant on a paladin.</li>
<li>Blessing of Salvation - 30% threat reduction. If you only have one paladin in your raid, this is the buff you need. If you don't have a paladin in your horde raid, you need to pressure your leadership to recruit one.</li>
<li><a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302183851/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=30621"><span  ><span class="purplename">[Prism of Inner Calm]</span></span></a> - until Blizzard changes this the item is worth around 10% threat reduction as long as your raid buffed crit rate is over 30% (and by the time you're killing Vashj it damn well better be). Keep an eye on this as Blizzard may buff it at some point.</li>
<li>Strategy - A lot of this depends on your tank and his TPS generation. If your tank can generate around 800 TPS you can give him a 10k threat lead and then unload without much worry of catching up. If you find yourself approaching the threat cap you should stop shocking first since they aren't affected by Spirit Weapons. A suggestion was made  of "downranking" your weapons for a few seconds, allowing you to continue to provide Unleashed Rage to the group with lowbie weapons so that your threat isn't increasing.</li>
<li>Battle Ankh - the improved ankh talent can certainly come in handy when clearing raid zones. You need to be extremely careful about pulling aggro however - if you pull and die, the mob will pick the next highest threat target to attack, which may not be the tank. A much safer method is to allow yourself to die to AoE, and have buffers primed to give you DPS buffs when you ankh. At that point you'll be free to take Blessing of Might if you didn't have it before, since your tank will now have a hefty threat lead.</li>
</ul><br>
<u><b><font size="+2">5 Notes for Raid Leaders</font></b></u><br>
[u][b][size=+1]5.1 Group compositions that work[u][b][size=+1]<br>
While building groups for Enhancement Shaman its important to remember that while we are a support class, we also require support from other group members to enhance our own DPS. Battle Shout is one of the most important buffs that Enhancement Shaman require, followed by Blessing of Salvation/Might. <br>
<br>
There are three possible group configurations that can make use of an Enhancement Shaman, listed below in order of the magnitude of buff they would bring to your raid as a whole.<br>
<br>
<u><b>Melee Group</b></u><br>
Enhancement Shaman (Windfury Totem)<br>
Rogue<br>
Rogue<br>
Rogue/Feral Druid/BM Hunter/MM Hunter/Ret paladin<br>
Fury or MS Warrior<br>
<br>
The Melee Group is the top priority to receive an Enhancement Shaman, it is where we provide the most utility.<br>
<br>
<u><b>Tank Hybrid Group</b></u><br>
Enhancement Shaman (Windfury Totem)<br>
Prot Warrior<br>
Prot Warrior<br>
Prot Paladin or Feral Druid<br>
Tree Druid<br>
<br>
This group brings an increased threat window for the rest of the raid, allowing the DPS classes to attack earlier and at full force, and should be the second priority for an Enhancement Shaman if you're able to bring 2 to a raid. If the Warrior or Paladin is the Main Tank, Windfury should be used. If the Feral is the Main Tank for an encounter, Grace of Air should be used.<br>
<br>
<u><b>Hunter/Feral Hybrid Group</b></u> <br>
Enhancement Shaman (Grace of Air Totem)<br>
Hunter<br>
Hunter<br>
Hunter<br>
Feral Druid<br>
<br>
This should be an extremely rare situation since very few guilds would ever have room in a roster for a third Enhancement Shaman, or it could be used for an encounter specific group setup. Regardless, a stacked hunter group benefits far less from Enhancement than any other physical DPS class since they cannot make use of Unleashed Rage. A Resto Shaman can actually benefit hunters more with the additional mana throughput. This group also places a strain on the Enhancement Shaman to maintain totems at the appropriate range for the melee and ranged in the group.<br>
<br>
<u><b><font size="+1">5.2 Evaluating with WoW Web Stats</font></b></u><br>
Determining if an Enhancement Shaman is performing to his potential is tricky for a raid leader as the damage output can be very random from one raid to the next, and there are no clear indicators of "using the wrong ability at the wrong time" as with other classes. The following list is intended to assist raid leaders on where to focus their efforts.<ul><li> First and foremost, familiarize yourself with this article so that you can talk the talk with the shaman. You need to understand what Stats benefit them and what sort of weapons they need, as well as getting a good understanding of just how random our DPS can be.</li>
<li> Examine your Enhancement Shaman on the Armory. Ensure that his gear meets the principles outline in this article. He should not have Hit gems, his gear should be properly enchanted for maximum DPS benefit, and he should be wearing the most appropriate gear for the spec. You may need to do some research on WoWHead or Thottbot to help make gear upgrade recommendations. He should not be trying to wear hybrid gear for spell damage or healing.</li>
<li> Group buffs are the primary reason you're bringing this shaman and so you should check to make sure he's fulfilling that role. Using WWS you can check to see how many times a totem was dropped on a fight by viewing the Shaman's record for that event. Check the "Performed" section and see how many times a totem was dropped. Multiply that by 120 seconds and compare to the length of the fight. The estimated uptime should be pretty close. If there are several minutes of uncovered time, your shaman is not keeping totems down and your melee group is suffering. Unleashed Rage should ideally have 100% uptime which approximately requires a 30% crit rate fully buffed.</li>
<li> Evaluating personal DPS contribution is tricky because it depends on armor level of the boss, your strategy on the boss, and the nature of the fight itself. <br>
<br>
His spread of damage should follow a general trend. Windfury attacks should account for 30-40%, Stormstrike for 10-12%. If its significantly less than that, the shaman may have forgotten to put Windfury on one or both weapons (or it ran out) or may not have been using Stormstrike on every 10sec cooldown. <br>
<br>
Shocks should be anywhere from 0-15% of his damage depending on the threat situation or magic immunities. His shock damage should come from a roughly equal number of Flame and Earth shocks, indicating a good DPS rotation of Flame-Earth-Flame. A perfect rotation would have 10 shocks per minute of combat, but given interference with stormstrike and using GCDs for consumables we could consider 7-8 shocks a minute to be an acceptable range.<br>
<br>
AutoAttack should make up the rest of his damage, normally 40-50%. <br>
<br>
There should be a minimal level of Parried attacks, indicating that he attacked from behind the boss. His Miss Rate on WWS is mostly irrelevant unless he hasn't hit capped his specials. Except for cases where debuffs cause loss of Hit %, no special attack should ever be Missed (only dodged/parried). The number of white attacks missed should not be used as an indicator of "needs more hit rating."</li>
<li> In the rare situation that you had two Enhancement shaman and need to compare their performance this becomes very difficult. You cannot simply say that they have 'similar gear', you will need to compare fully raid buffed stats including all group buffs for Hit, Crit, and Attack Power. Group composition is extremely important. If one shaman only had Trueshot Aura but the other had LotP and Battle Shout, the second shaman (all else being equal) should have a significant advantage over the other. Differences of 100 AP or 5% crit can easily explain large gaps in DPS output. Also check and compare Shock rotations and Stormstrike use. More often than not though, the culprit is group buffs or using an Elixir instead of a Flask.</li>
</ul><br>
<u><b><font size="+2">6 Simulations</font></b></u><br>
The nature of windfury and flurry interactions make closed form modeling extremely difficult and prone to a high degree of deviation. The Enhancement community turned to combat simulators as a way to model our DPS to make informed decisions. Currently the best utility for doing this is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302183851/http://theorycraft.narod.ru/" target="_blank"><i>Yo!'s simulator</i></a>. <br>
<br>
To use Yo's simulator, load the armory or view your character paperdoll in-game. Make a note of which buffs you have active. Input your stats into the first panel, including your strength and agility for Blessings of Kings calculations. (You do not need BoK on your character for this) Your Hit% should be a sum of the paperdoll value and any from talents. (Nature's Guidance and Improved Dual Wielding do not show up in the paper doll)<br>
<br>
Change the panel to the Procs and Buffs pages and enter things appropriately. Not all trinkets are represented, some things like the Bloodlust Brooch should be added as a static AP value to your stats. (Benefit * LengthOfBuff / Cooldown)<br>
<br>
Yo's Sim is most accurate when its run for long periods of time, multiple times. If you want EP values, the recommended method is to run the sim for 5,000 - 10,000 hours between 5-10 times, taking the average of all the EP values as the result. If you want to simply compare DPS between item upgrades, multiple runs at 1,000 hours should be sufficient. The length of the sim run helps to smooth out the randomness of windfury/flurry in our DPS model.<br>

I think Lootzor and Pawn work the same way:  you give each stat a "weight" value; large weight means the stat is more important.<br>
<br>
I'm more comfortable working with small numbers than with the 100s, but as long a the ratios are the same, I think you're good.<br>
<br>
For someone at the Kara/Gruul/Mag level (2200 AP, 25% Crit, 22% Hit), I believe Tornhoof and I agree that the lootzor values are:<br>
<br>
Str = 1.1<br>
Agi = 1.0<br>
AP = 0.5<br>
CR = 1.0<br>
HR = 0.7<br>
<br>
In fact, here's a link to that search in Lootzor:  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302183851/http://www.lootzor.com/index.php?c=7&amp;l=70&amp;b=0&amp;s=-1&amp;r=7&amp;g=3&amp;i=10&amp;z=5&amp;p=beu1.1hbfu1hecu1hedu.7heeu.5" target="_blank">http://www.lootzor.com/index.php?c=7...u1hedu.7heeu.5</a><br>
<br>
Disquette's values were a little different, mainly because used a broader range of stats and averaged across them all.<br>
<br>
As a matter of style/utility, I'd think you'd put these at the top of your post rather than at the bottom, but that's a pretty minor comment.<br>

		<div id="post_message_393565">Yeah, that's right.  "Equivalences" are just inverted "weights."  For equivalencies, you're just saying "I would be equally happy getting 1 CR or 1.43 HR."  For weights, you're saying "HR is 0.7 times as good as [1.0] CR."<br>
<br>
I really like the "weight" system myself, because it allows for quick input into lootzor, and it also conforms to the AEP paradigm.  You can think of those weights as AEP for us (since Agi is 1.0 as well) or CritEP if you prefer.  (Technically, AGI is 0.97 = 22.1*1.1/25, but I think 1.0 is close enough for simplicity's sake.)  I believe pawn uses the same approach, to give each item a "value" in the tooltip.</div>

<br>
It may be that, at higher levels of gear, the percentage of damage that consists of Shocks will be so low that it's more worthwhile to just gear without thought to mana and reduce the number of shocks. But, at my level, with 0 spell damage, shocks are still a significant portion of my damage (~156 dps with debuffs). Since I am at the point where it is possible to run OOM during a full burn cycle, there must exist some equivalence between extra mana vs extra melee stats.<br>
<br>
AP and +hit has the advantage of doing double duty of increasing melee damage while boosting mana gains, but relying on SR completely is also not always optimal. Timing SR with a trinket maximises mana gain, but you have to time it when you can be certain you won't waste SR procs. However, in many encounters, there exist damage windows where it's optimal to save your trinket for. These two scenarios don't always occur at the same time.<br>
<br>
With a full burn DPS cycle being estimated at least ~13k mana per two minutes, we need to consider the question: What is the optimal ratio of intellect and mp5 to melee stats?<br>
<br>
This will be a multivariable function which several critical points exist. Some things to consider:<br>
-Does there exist any itemization points where the additional melee damage outweighs being able to shock every cooldown?<br>
-If there is not, what is the minimum mana pool, mp5 and mana from SR required to sustain a full burn cycle.</div>

		<div id="post_message_393942">Panny:  I guess your mileage may vary.  Some shaman have mana issues, others never do.  It all depends on your gear, your raid composition, and the encounter.  <br>
<br>
It's impossible to have a realistic "dps weight" for mp5, int or stamina, because there is no direct connection between them and the other dps stats.  At best, you should establish the amount of mana used in a 2 minute burn cycle, and develop a formula to express how much minimum mana a shaman would need, based on his AP (since AP directly feeds your mana regen with SR).  mp5 is going to always, always, always be an inferior stat to Int for a decently geared shaman, since that shaman will be regenerating more mana with SR than he has room for in his small mana pool, and Int is a much cheaper itemization stat.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, a 'full burn cycle' of mana consumption is nearly always constant, so there's not a lot of variables involved.  Just determine the formula needed for complete sustainability based on buffed AP and weapon speed.<br>
<br>

<br>
My approach with "weights" is to answer the question, "If someone gave you 1 item point, what would you want it to be?"  Right now, the answer is 1 Str (weight 1.1).  If you couldn't get that, you'd want either 1 CR or 1 Agi (weight 1) or 2 AP (weight 0.5).  If you couldn't get those, you'd say 1 HR (weight 0.7).<br>
<br>
Where does INT fit in there?  I'll do a super rough calc that perhaps other people could refine.<br>
<br>
1 INT = 15 mana.  <br>
<br>
Converting mana into damage:  ES spam is 675 dmg / 535 mana, or 1.26 DPM.  (Not accounting for FS/ES rotations or SS debuff, rough numbers.)<br>
<br>
So the 1 INT gives 15 * 1.1 (kings) * 1.26 = 21 damage.  Generously, we can say that you get to reuse it every 2 minutes because of SR, making this 21/120 = 0.18 dps.<br>
<br>
(I'm overlooking the ES cooldown, because the max number of shocks in a 2 min window is controlled by mana, not by that cooldown.)<br>
<br>
Tornhoof's sim and my sim agreed earlier this week that 100 AP would add about 22 dps (to someone with approx. full kara gear).  That's 0.22 DPS/AP, compared to 0.18 DPS/INT.  Ratioing down from AP's weight, the weight for INT should be about 0.5 * 18/22 = 0.41.<br>
<br>
<br>
These are really rough numbers and there might be errors.  But if they're approximately right, INT is so weak that you'd prefer even 1 point of AP to 1 point of INT.</div>

</div>I like seeing this result. It makes me feel good about giving INT at least some weight in my Lootzor string. It raises a couple questions for me:<br>
<br>
<b>What's the maximum mana pool required for 2 minutes of SS, ES/FS, and totems between Shamanistic Rage (plus mana pot) cooldowns?</b><br>
I think someone has done this work before, but it's easier for me to duplicate it than to search for it.<br>
SS x 120/10 = 236*12 = 2832<br>
SoE, WF, Mana Spring x 1 + Searing x 2 = 225 + 243 + 90 + 153*2 = 864 (note this is with Totemic Focus, adjust upwards by 25% if this doesn't apply to you... now that I explicitly see that this talent is only worth 288 mana/120 sec = 12mp5, I might get rid of it)<br>
Mana gained from Mana Spring = 12*120/2 = -720<br>
ES x 120/6/2, minus one lost to GCD = 535*9 = 4815<br>
FS x 120/6/2, minus one lost to GCD = 500*9 = 4500<br>
Totemic call with 5 seconds left on totem durations = -238<br>
2832 + 864 - 720 + 4815 + 4500 - 238 = 12053<br>
<br>
We can then safely say that any INT which raises our buffed mana pool above 12053 is going to be useless, if we can get a refill off of SR + mana pot. If one waited until their mana pool were depleted by the amount of a Super Mana Pot at the start of a fight, chugged one, and then continued chugging each time the CD was up, you would get a larger "effective" mana pool without any more INT. A Super Mana is at least 1800 and averages 2400 mana, so if you accept the average, you don't need INT which raises the buffed mana pool above 9653. (Do pots still crit?)<br>
<br>
<b>Can we expect to fill that up with Shamanistic Rage?</b><br>
Obviously, this is going to vary a lot with gear; and as most shamans know, it also depends on the fight (whether or not you can get a nice solid 30 seconds of attacking the ass end of a boss mob without having to move). We know that you get 15% of your AP back per proc. Do we have hard data on whether this is PPM or percentage-based?</div>

SoE, WF, Mana Spring x 1 + Searing x 2 = 288 + 312 + 115 + 196*2 = 1107<br>
Mana gained from Mana Spring = 12*120/2 = -720<br>
ES x 120/6/2, 5 seconds + 1 sec for gcd = 460*10 = 4600<br>
FS x 120/6/2, 5 seconds + 1 sec for gcd = 430*10 = 4300<br>
Totemic call with 5 seconds left on totem durations = -237<br>
2712 + 1107 - 720 + 4600 + 4300 - 237 = 11762<br>
<br>
With 2 extra shocks and the 5% extra damage adding up to a third extra shock in damage.  With one out of the 20 proccing Elemental devastation for +9% crit as well on average.<br>
<br>
With an Enhance/Ele spec of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304054453/http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/classes/shaman/talents.html?5500005000300000000050250021050113253115100000000000000000000" target="_blank">http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/...00000000000000</a><br>
<br>
So it's a savings of only about 300 mana with 3 extra shocks of damage, and a solid chance at proccing +9% crit every two minutes.<br>
<br>
SR in my experience seemed to be PPM, as with a two hander it was proccing almost every swing fairly reliably.  However dual wield seems to be PPM per hand, so you end up with almost the same effect at about twice the rate.  The description is also fairly typical of a PPM description on the tooltip.<br>
<br>
<br>
Also keep in mind that once your attack power reaches a certain breakpoint the time frame changes.  You'll be filling your mana pool and able to refresh all your totems inside the window of SR, and even get free shocks off as well.<br>
<br>
With SR lasting 30 seconds and enough attack power, you can almost guarantee yourself full mana at the end of 30 seconds.  With a full totem refresh.<br>
<br>
So a full totem refresh is about 8 seconds with GCD I believe.  Which leaves 22 seconds for other spells.  Which is 3 shocks untalented, or 4 talented.<br>
<br>
If we assume the enh/resto build and full mana at the end of SR we have:<br>
<br>
SS x 90/10 = 236*9 = 2124<br>
SoE, WF, Mana Spring x 1 + Searing x 2 = 225 + 243 + 90 + 153*2 = FREE (SHould be able to drop and recover during SR uptime)<br>
Mana gained from Mana Spring = 12*120/2 = -720 (will be up during SR)<br>
ES x 90/7/2 = 535*6 = 3210 (there's rounding here, but rounding down due to not being able to land a partial shock)<br>
FS x 90/7/2 = 500*6 = 3000<br>
Totemic call with 5 seconds left on totem durations = -238 (Should probably not count as it will happen during SR?)<br>
2124 - 720 + 3210 + 3000 - 237 = 7377<br>
<br>
With Enh/Ele:<br>
<br>
SS x 90/10 = 226*9 = 2034<br>
SoE, WF, Mana Spring x 1 + Searing x 2 = 288 + 312 + 115 + 196*2 = FREE<br>
Mana gained from Mana Spring = 12*120/2 = -720<br>
ES x 90/6/2 = 460*7.5 = 3450 (15 shocks, so one needs to be 8, averaging as it can go either way)<br>
FS x 90/6/2 = 430*7.5 = 3225<br>
Totemic call with 5 seconds left on totem durations = -237<br>
2034 - 720 + 3450 + 3225 - 237 = 7752 (with 3 more shocks and 75% of the damage of another shock)<br>
<br>
NOTE that these are only if you are able to maintain a shock rotation and re-drop all totems during SR, ending at full mana.  If you are able to proc 400 mana/second, you can get 12000.  500 mana every two seconds (which is more reasonable at higher ends of gear) is 7500 mana during SR.  The closer you can get to the end of SR with full mana without interrupting your shock/SS rotation, the closer to efficient you get.  Right now I only ever seem to need the cheap combat mana pots to keep shocks going.  Although I'm usually aggro capped before that, or have trouble keeping on the mob for the full duration.<br>
<br>
<b>Quick Conclusion</b><br>
I have some overlap and rounding issues here, and will assume that hardly everyone keeps up a perfect dps rotation on every cooldown, or gets 100% uptime.  These numbers are pointing at about 7400-7800 under optimum conditions and a certain level of AP.  I'd say 8500 is probably the ideal amount of mana to allow for breathing room WITHOUT relying on pots.  If you have pots you either can get more breathing room or a lower mana pool.  Or save the cooldowns for non-mana pots.<br>
<br>
I also hardly ever find myself using totemic call unless I'm moving away from my old totems, as I'd rather refresh them one at a time and not take the buffs off my group for sake of my mana efficiency.  There's also water shield to consider, which procs off of many more conditions then Lightning Shield, so I usually keep it up all the time.</div>

</div>Not including CoE, imp. scorch, Misery or SS debuff is a mistake imho, ES+FS rotation is ~156 DPS. According to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304054453/http://elitistjerks.com/385098-post1039.html" target="_blank">simple maths I did comparing Bladed Shoulderpads of the Merciless vs Cyclone Spaulders</a>, if you accept that it is possible to run OoM, there's definitely cases where going for the int is more advantageous. <br>
<br>
I suppose creating a ratio isn't as useful as other stats, as after your mana pool is a certain size compared to your gains from SR, it stops contributing to your DPS. The fact that the question "how much int do I need" will vary for different encounters, your stats, and raid composition. With no gear changes, on one week of Gruul, I gained <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304054453/http://www.lossendil.com/wws/?report=bzhg6d1n66jdg&amp;s=4750-5179&amp;a=6" target="_blank">3-4k mana</a> per Shamanistic Rage.

<b>What's the maximum mana pool required for 2 minutes of SS, ES/FS, and totems between Shamanistic Rage (plus mana pot) cooldowns?</b><br>
I think someone has done this work before, but it's easier for me to duplicate it than to search for it.<br>
SS x 120/10 = 236*12 = 2832<br>
SoE, WF, Mana Spring x 1 + Searing x 2 = 225 + 243 + 90 + 153*2 = 864 (note this is with Totemic Focus, adjust upwards by 25% if this doesn't apply to you... now that I explicitly see that this talent is only worth 288 mana/120 sec = 12mp5, I might get rid of it)<br>
Mana gained from Mana Spring = 12*120/2 = -720<br>
ES x 120/6/2, minus one lost to GCD = 535*9 = 4815<br>
FS x 120/6/2, minus one lost to GCD = 500*9 = 4500<br>
Totemic call with 5 seconds left on totem durations = -238<br>
2832 + 864 - 720 + 4815 + 4500 - 238 = 12053<br>
<br>
We can then safely say that any INT which raises our buffed mana pool above 12053 is going to be useless, if we can get a refill off of SR + mana pot. If one waited until their mana pool were depleted by the amount of a Super Mana Pot at the start of a fight, chugged one, and then continued chugging each time the CD was up, you would get a larger "effective" mana pool without any more INT. A Super Mana is at least 1800 and averages 2400 mana, so if you accept the average, you don't need INT which raises the buffed mana pool above 9653. (Do pots still crit?)</div>

Obviously, this is going to vary a lot with gear; and as most shamans know, it also depends on the fight (whether or not you can get a nice solid 30 seconds of attacking the ass end of a boss mob without having to move). We know that you get 15% of your AP back per proc. Do we have hard data on whether this is PPM or percentage-based?</div>

</div>With that kind of unbuffed AP you should be getting pretty much an entire mana bar back on Mag. The first 1-2 min of Mag are very mana intense because you (should be) redropping WF and SoE at each Channeler as you move. The last Mag kill we did I popped SR as soon as we started and just started burning mana down on the Channeler. After that just use it every time its up and you shouldn't have to use any pots. Do you not have paladins at all? If you do, and are not getting JoW, you need to yell at them. My paladins claimed they "couldn't keep judgments on" until I bitched about it non stop and made them do it. Now they keep it up all the time because they can see the huge returns we get from JoL and JoW.<br>

		<div id="post_message_396374">Maybe there should be a few lines in the OP about which pally buffs are best for enhancement. In an ideal world, you'd get all four (kings, might, wisdom, salvation), but in reality we usually only run with three paladins. I tend to prefer kings, might, salve as my combination, due to the fact that kings and might mean I gain a healthy amount of mana back from each SR proc. <br>
<br>
These are the pros and cons of each based on my experiences:<br>
<br>
Kings - Increases all stats by 10%. <br>
Pros: Good in almost every situation.<br>
Cons: Causes a decent increase in threat generation due to harder hits and more shocks.<br>
<br>
Might - Increases AP by 220.<br>
Pros: More AP means stronger attacks, more SR mana returns.<br>
Cons: Threat generation when combined with kings. Paladins have to buff this separately and refresh during battle.<br>
<br>
Wisdom - Returns 42 mp5.<br>
Pros: Best blessing for mana regen, shines on long fights.<br>
Cons: Not always necessary with proper use of SR.<br>
<br>
Salvation - Decrease threat generated by 30%<br>
Pros: Best blessing for threat problems, allows 30% more dps.<br>
Cons: Useless blessing when not threat capped.<br>
<br>
In general, the other shaman always want kings, wisdom and salvation. I usually have to coordinate with the wisdom pally to get the five minute version of might and have it refreshed during battle. I placed that under con because if the pally is dead or healing then you're out of a buff after the first five minutes.<br>
<br>
It's also worth noting (perhaps under might?) that on nights where we have a fury warrior in the dps group I tend to need salvation more, due to battleshout.</div>

</div>This is slightly off topic, but proper placement of totems helps a lot during the first 2 minutes of Mag. With 30yd totems you can place them between the first and second channeler and not have to redrop until you move to the third one. I usually end up dropping totems twice after the pull, and it makes a noticeable difference in my mana pool going into phase 2. I also save SR and bloodlust till the 3rd channeler, but that's just my personal preference.<br>
<br>
I've noticed a lot of fights where good totem placement can make mana management much easier, like Mag and Hydross. Just make sure your group knows where you're placing the totems so they can stay near them.</div>

I'd agree with your friend.  I give STR a 1.1 weight and HR only 0.7. <br>
<br>
Right now, I have 4cr/6sta in mine for the yellow slot, but that's because I just haven't gotten around to changing it since settling on the stat weights.<br>

According to a few sims and other approaches, HR just isn't that hot above some level.  You don't even need to be that close to the cap (25.5) before it starts giving diminishing returns.  (As far as why this might be, I would guess it's because SS and WF only have 5% base miss rate.)</div>

</div>Yeah, I do redrop WF/SoE; I also drop Fire Elemental Totem for the first 2 channelers (we MD one onto the first tank and he tanks 2 in one spot), as well as earth shocking heals/shadow bolt volleys. I typically use my trinkets on the channelers but save my SR for Magtheridon, which lets me get a full bar back if I take a few seconds off of shocking. Heroism, I don't bother popping for the first 2 Channelers because I would just pull aggro, I usually save it for the 3rd or so. I'm going to assume that any difference left over is due to JoW; we usually carry 3-4 Holy paladins, maybe I can get one of them to start judging it for me.<br>

				The cooldown on Windfury Weapon means that an OH that is faster than the MH is now extremely detrimental to shaman DPS. The fast OH is more likely to hit a mob again after a WF cooldown is up, and therefore has the first opportunity to proc a new WF and trigger the cooldown again. The OH interference prevents MH WF procs and thus reduces your DPS. It has been shown that this cooldown interference is so severe that replacing an epic dagger OH (any from KZ as an example) with a green or blue 2.6 speed OH will actually increase your DPS. (Again, despite this problem, it is still preferrable to have WF on the OH. Any WF proc, even on the OH, will result in more DPS over time than FlameTongue or Rockbiter on the OH.)<br>

</div>Can you elaborate on this point just a little bit? Since the WF bonus is not halved by dual wielding, why do you not want WF to proc on the off-hand?

</div>Yes I understand that much, but why do they do less damage? Is it just from the DW off-hand penalty? <br>

</div>Yeah.  The original post is a little unclear on this, and it also has the consequence of CR being EQUAL to AP, after considering the item budget.   Perhaps some clarification should indicate that AP and CR are equally good (approximately) due to their different itemization costs.  It also means that Strength is superior to both, after considering Kings.</div>

		<div id="post_message_396826">There's something that has been bugging me for a while. I always see people posting that you need a certain amount of hit rating to be effective, usually you see numbers around 20% or 200 hit rating. Or you see people concerned that they can't afford to lose hit rating. Is there really any truth to this though? I've been finding when using tools like pawn and lootzor that items lacking +hit often score very high. Since AEP ratings are designed to give a genuine value to items, are these ratings somehow broken? Or are players just clinging to the notion that hit is required out of habit?<br>
<br>
My curiosity on this subject has led me to make myself a bit of a guinea pig. I've been taking items based solely on AEP style ratings for the last month or so, my hit rating has plummeted from around 220 to 111. My damage however <i>feels</i> like it's improved though I haven't been logging much data so I can't say with any certainty. <br>
<br>
When Pater posted his sim one thing I checked right off was whether the relative value of hit rating changed depending on how much you had. I put in regular raid buffed values and lowered the +hit from gear to 0%, then I increased it by 5% and ran it again. I then did the same change again, going from 11% to 16%. The results came out as such:<br>
<br>
0% -&gt; 5% (9% -&gt; 14%)<br>
847.5 -&gt; 875.8 = 28.3 DPS gained<br>
<br>
11% -&gt; 16% (20% -&gt; 25%)<br>
910.4 -&gt; 940 = 29.6 DPS gained<br>
<br>
Is there anything I'm missing? I'm trying find anything other than anecdotal evidence that a certain amount of hit rating is more beneficial than an equal amount of item budget spent on AP or crit stats. Certainly due to the non-linear cost you want items that have a balance of all DPS stats, but many pieces just aren't itemized that way. Should I be passing over items that score higher overall for ones that though scoring lower have a more even stat distribution?</div>

Everything else +8 str.<br>

That being said I was finding myself lacking due to getting pieces of dps gear with no +hit and trying to stay above certain minimums, so threw in a little extra +hit.<br>

Regarding the whole paladin thing, we've had bad luck keeping active raiding paladins (horde guild).  After having 4 people reroll as pallys with BC, 3 of them stopped playing due to one reason or another, and we're only now back up to 3 pallys.  Typically running with one, 2 if we're lucky.

</div>True, however sacrificing some of that hit for for strength would go some way to compensating you. Just some quick numbers and my math is fairly poor so I may make some mistakes.<br>
<br>
Lets assume 2200 AP and take 100 hit rating and exchange it for 100 str. We would lose 6.33% hit and I guess 6.33% SR procs? Our overall mana gain would go down by 6.33% as well if I'm correct. With kings and UR that 100 str would gain us 242 AP? Which would gain us an additional 36.3 mana per SR proc pushing them from 330 to 366.3 an 11% gain. So you'd get 6.33 percent fewer procs bu tthe procs would return 11% more mana, assuming no errors in my math which is a pretty big assumption. Either way it should be a small change. <br>
<br>
You're correct as well that with the greatly reduced glancing rate the crit cap even without as much +hit is still quite high.</div>

Assume you have 10 white swings in 10 seconds (2.6 weapons, perma-hasted).<br>
<br>
You would also have 2 stormstrike swings, and probably 4 windfury swings that are unaffected by your drop in hit (since they're maxed out by your talents hit-wise).<br>

So, instead of losing 100% * 6.33% = 6.33% SR loss, you actually have<br>

Edit: A different subject. We usually have a GoA-dps group, it consists of a druid, enhancement shammy (me!), rogue, hunter and a warrior. I'd like to see some number-crunching on dps output of such a group with GoA or WF, I'd think GoA wins in such a group. Also, in the OP's analysis of WF and Agi totem, the dps increase of the shaman itself with GoA isnt added, it should be! :p</div>

		<div id="post_message_397553">I'd like to interject at this time that we have quite a few theories going on here, and I'm not sure how much they've actually been tested.  This worries me.<br>
<br>
If we didn't test theories, we wouldn't know about the Windfury offhand bonus being exactly what it is. (minor deviation from theory)<br>
<br>
If we didn't test theories, we wouldn't have discovered the 36% chance to WF when dual wielding . (major deviation from theory)<br>
<br>
If we didn't test theories, we wouldn't know that we're getting more flurried attacks than we should. (major deviation from theory)<br>
<br>
Even blasted lands tests are fine for testing these out, but until they are tested, I'm not very comfortable with treating the results from any of this as being worth much.<br>
<br>
For blasted lands tests, back into your numbers - run recap and find out what your actual crit rate and hit rate are, then plug those into your sim or formula.  Find out how many auto-attack swings you had, compare it to what your model suggests.  Find out how many windfury procs you had, compare that to the model.  You wont have any dodge/block/parry/glancing, but the models and formulas need to be able to account for this situation as well, so you might as well start on the scenario that's easiest to test.<br>
<br>
I'm not saying that any of the formulas or stat valuations are wrong, I'm saying that we currently don't seem to be confirming that they're right.</div>

</div>My guild is definately not the best out there, we've just started SSC 2 weeks ago, got 2 bossed down, and we are working on Tidewalker. But we seem to get the highest overal dps output with this GoA group thing. I dont see why anyone would deem this as a stupid group, 5% crit aura, battleshout, Ferocious Inspiration from the BM hunter (3% extra dmg), and totems + Unleashed Rage makes a damn fine dps group imo :p The druid also offtanks occasionally, and since their agro scales with dmg this group is also rather good for that, only thing he misses is an imp.<br>
<br>
I understand perfectly well that the warrior's dps is WAY higher with WF, thats obvious. However, if the warrior uses stones on his weapons + GoA, the rogues uses poisons + GoA, and the other 3 dps get the benefits from GoA aswell... ah well, ill test it next Karathress, no holding back on that fight anyway.

</div>Unless you bring no other melees to your raid beyond one warrior and one rogue you can organize your groups better than this. As an enhancement Shaman you should have these people in your group in order of priority: DPS warriors, sword rogues, dagger rogues, LotP druids (LotP druids + BM hunters = happiness, so be nice and share them). If you use warriors for offtanks, having them in your group will allow them to build threat more easily with WFT and the extra AP, but they are usually better in the MT group for Imp/Tree buffs. <br>
<br>
Having a hunter in the group for the BM bonus is not nearly worth the opportunity cost of having an additional melee gain the benefits of WFT. This is one of the most common mistakes that people make in organizing groups. Ferocious Inspiration is a flat 3% bonus to any sort of damage and it makes Hunters useful in any damage-dealing group, whereas the difference between GoA and WF for warriors and rogues is tremendous by the time you are in SSC. If you have a hunter in a mage group FI is roughly as effective as it is to a melee group, but that hunter will get far less benefit from shaman totems than a melee class would. If you have a rogue in the mage group when the hunter is in your group, you are crippling that rogue's DPS (no totems, no battle shout) and the hunter is not providing any real additional benefit (not affected by battle shout, WF does nothing, only receives half benefit from GoA/SoE). If you can provide WFT to four other melee classes you should absolutely be doing it, because nothing else will provide them with as big of a benefit as what you will.</div>

</div>Well, there have been more posts prior to that, and I'd suggest reading more than the OP only (check Aj, and Snorkle's replies). It truely seems like an interesting read. But to give small insight to what is being discussed there:<br>
<br>
WF has a 3 second cooldown. Once it procs, it wont proc again in the next 3 seconds. With weapons of 2.6 speed, without flurry or anything, this means that WF *can* proc every other swing. So, WF, normal swing, WF, is possible. Now, what happens when flurry + haste-rating items make you swing faster than 1.5 seconds, lets say 1.49. To have a chance to proc WF after a WF you would need 2 swings instead of only 1. So in theory, when you get haste-rating items that make you swing faster than 1.5 seconds your WF proc rate *will* go down. Yes, your white damage will increase, but your WF dmg over time will go down. Your overal dps will be lower with 1.49 swing speed than with 1.5 swing speed.<br>
<br>
The next question would be, how is the overal dps output when the swingspeed becomes 1.4, or 1.3, or even lower, it will be better than 1.49 thats for sure, but at what point will it be better than 1,5 speed. <br>
<br>
The thread I linked discusses just that.  <br>
<br>
Note, this theory is about swing speed, NOT weapon speed. SLOW/SLOW is always the way to go when it comes to weapon speed.<br>
<br>
But, if you feel that the original poster has no idea what he is talking about, please explain to me why that is the case. This thread was made by Aj and Snorkle, which are both well known on the european shaman boards for their theorycrafting.<br>
<br>
I have always really apreciated these forums as a source of information, and tbh I'd expected a better response than "he just doesnt have a clue" <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302183927im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":)" class="inlineimg"></div>

</div>We usually dont have many rogues with us, or dps warriors for that matter. And my question wasnt "Is Stones + Poisons + GoA better than WF?". It was: Wont my group dps be better with goa, when it consists of a druid/hunter/warrior/rogue/me and the rogue and warrior use stones/poisons? :p<br>

<br>
As an enhancement shaman, I have problems often with my task being recognized (as a buffer).<br>
<br>
So I have a petition tho whoever knows how to code, that would greatly help our spec.<br>
<br>
Make an addon that calculates the DPS given to party by our buffs. This can be somewhat complicated, but at least some parts are easy.<br>
<br>
By selecting Skill Details in swstats, you can get how many Windfury damage a player did. So, it should be easy to extract those numbers and summarize them up in a separate addon. I'm finding that rogues do an average 7% damage from my Windfury Totem, and warriors go up to 15%.<br>
<br>
Now, this part was easy. How to calculate STR totem (or AGI if it's down instead of Windfury) and Unleashed Rage?<br>
<br>
I'm sure the mats are not easy for certain classes considering instants and procs, but if Recap and SWStats can get so much accurate info about that data, it should not be hard for someone with enough knowledge on scripting and game mechanics to code something easy that can report at the end of the fight something like:<br>
<br>
Tradewind's own damage: 340932.<br>
WF given to party: +89023.<br>
+STR given to party: +14932.<br>
UR given to party: +40834.<br>

</div>I agree that previously ele/enh shaman were competing with resto shaman. But this comparison was a lot better  pre-expansion than it is now. <br>
<br>
If you take one of the many generic melee dps powerhouse groups for example...<br>
feral,<br>
dps war,<br>
rogue,<br>
rogue,<br>
&lt;some shaman&gt;<br>
<br>
A resto shaman can still provide great buffs to this group similar to an enhancement shaman. However the resto shamans totems and the other members group buffs (Battle shout, lotp) will be entirely wasted on the resto shaman. <br>
<br>
The enhancement shaman drops marginally superior totems but also takes advantage of his totems and the other melee buffs. Also Unleashed rage is a 300 AP buff in a raid setting which is certainly significant since it is almost always up. With these factors altogether, there is a very significant gap in the raid strength of a melee group with an enh shaman and one with a resto shaman.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Indeed.  The percentage increases make a compelling case for an enhancement shaman in a melee group.<br>

Whether you top some sort of "contribution" meter is pretty irrelevant, especially with all the synergistic effects that go on in a group/raid (ie how much of your UR uptime was from the crit buff you got from a feral druid etc etc).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

The 5 second cooldown on shocks especially (helpful on damage and fights where I have to help interrupt), and elemental devastation procs often enough to make the talents worthwhile - kicking my crit up to over 40% quite easily.<br>

My main selling point for it is the ability to maintain a full shock rotation much without having to go to pots (beyond the occasionaly combat pot), on a faster cooldown, and for more damage.<br>

		<div id="post_message_406293"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Well, based on numbers found in this thread 1 CR = 2 AP. 4% crit is 88.4 CR so it would only take 176.8 AP to equal the benefit of 4% crit. Thus 200 AP is probably slightly better than 4% crit.<br>
<br>
A few months ago I did some math based on my own WWS parses to assign a weighting to each stat. This is when I first discovered that +hit was overvalued, and that crit and attack power are normally a better use of item budget for us. The weightings I came up with a few months ago are very close to what you will find in this thread, and since these guys are probably better at math than I am, I just use theirs.<br>
<br>
1 CR = 1.43 HR = 2 AP. Decide how much you value stamina in comparison to those three stats and it will be very easy for you to figure out which items are upgrades for you.<br>
<br>
Honestly it's best to not think in terms of stacking one stat. All three of these stats are good for us, and they all depend on eachother. You want all three of them, and what is important is the quantities involved. Yes, one of them might be the 'superior' use of item budget, but it's not like we get to design our own items. We have to use what Blizzard gives us. My hit rating isn't intentionally low because I think +hit sucks, that's just how it worked out for me by following the above stat weightings. <br>
<br>
The randomness of drops had an impact aswell because I don't hold out for the statistically best upgrade. If an item is an upgrade, I'm sending on it, regardless of if there is a bigger upgrade out there.<br>
<br>
Anyway, yeah we switch our Bloodlusts around like that a lot. Basically whoever benefits the most from it on any given encounter is going to get most, if not all of the Bloodlusts. Also, I've picked up quite a few upgrades very recently(bracer, ring, cloak and breastplate off the top of my head), so the gear in my armory profile is better than what I was using for those WWS parses I linked.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I'm sure you already know the answer to at least 3 of those questions by this point in the discussion.<br>
<br>
Metagem - generally accepted as 3% Crit Dmg &gt; Haste effect &gt; soul shard gem &gt; stam/stun resist<br>
<br>
I believe we are treating haste as a 0.9 or 1.0 weight on stats.<br>
<br>
The tiered bonuses I can't really speak of since I'm not up to that point yet, although the T5 2pc certainly has value for a player who plays to the hybrid/support style, less value to those who want to be a rogue in mail. <br>
<br>
There is no detrimental effect that anyone is aware of from having an OH slower than the MH to the Windfury cycle, the only downside is that you lose the "bugged" flurry effect from having the same MH/OH speeds.<br>
<br>
Str/Crit gems are always better than +8 Hit. No shaman should ever be using +8 Hit gems unless for some silly reason they chose not to grab the +9% Hit from talents. <br>
<br>
The Ashtongue trinket was shown in the Itemization thread to have less AP bonus over time than the Bloodlust brooch did, so the Tsunami Talisman would likely be the better choice.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

a- As long as you happen to have 2 blue gems use Relentless Earthstorm Diamond, failing that Swift Skyfire.<br>
<br>
b- One point of haste rating is worth about one point of strength (only 3 posts above yours).<br>
<br>
c- T5 4piece is roghly 3-4% dps, T6 4piece is closer to 2%, though the gains from having 4 pieces of the superior tier 6 outweigh this.<br>
<br>
d- Conclusions have been inconclusive.<br>
<br>
e- The str/crit gem will ALWAYS be better for all levels of gear from zero hit rating to hit capped (unless youre not actually enh specced, just wanting to do some physical dps with your resto spec).<br>
<br>
f- On a stand and deliver fight the Ashtongue Talisman looks like a 137AP which is far superior to the Tsunami Talisman. Edit:: or not. Depends on the uptime of the Tsunami AP buff, one proc every 70 seconds or more often would make the Tsunami better than the Ashtongue, any less would favour the Ashtongue (excuse my bad midnight maths).<br>

				It's not that great. 50% to do 275 is basically 50% uptime, so a passive 137.5 AP. Compared to Bloodlust Brooch, which is a passive 72 that adds 278 for 20/120... 72+46.3=118.3ap. So it's actually only a 19 ap bonus over Bloodlust Brooch, and has the added downside of being less controllable; you can guarantee that the +278ap of the Brooch occurs during SR, boosting its output.<br>
<br>
So actually... it's pretty damn bad for where it is in the game... barely an upgrade over a badge trinket.

				<div style="font-style:italic">Its been discussed a few times. To be honest I'd never even heard of it (I think most people call it twisting) until the xpack and all the Alliance shaman were the ones pushing it forward. I've no intention of trying it out. I already feel like I'm waiting on GCD quite a bit and adding that twisting into a 10 second rotation is going to be crazy. Trying to fit 2 totem drops + 2 Shocks + SS into a 10 second period is going to fill the entire period with a GCD. The mana cost alone is enough to dissuade me without even thinking of the benefit - there's no way I could sustain dropping 2 totems every 10 seconds over a 10 minute fight.</div>

</div>I only use tranquil air on very threat sensitive fights.  I find I'm not really ever threat capped except when I'm using shamanistic rage, bugged judgment of light (320 healing procs), and heroism at the same time, in which case my treat sometimes spikes on omen up above 1300 tps; a number that I'm obviously not capable of generating with damage alone.  <br>
<br>
I did use TA on void reaver last night with a great deal of success, I was able to go all out the entire fight and came close pulling aggro at the very end.  We have our melee dps stay in the entire fight instead of stepping out to avoid poundings.  My dps warrior did unfortunately die to aggro with less than a minute left in the fight.<br>

After pulling aggro on VR a couple weeks back one of the guild alchemists sent me a couple stacks and told me to stop dying. Using them for a week on Teron and such where I have a problem with coming close to the threat cap seemed to make a difference, but I didn't have any hard numbers on it. The single best time I've found to use them is in the first 20 or so seconds of a fight so you start at very low threat with a slightly higher ceiling to deal with WF's unpredictability.<br>
<br>
As for my latest experiences, I was forced to twist TA/WF during the last 20% of our latest anetheron to bloodlust my group. I was pretty much capped, while my rogues and warriors were safely behind. Managed to keep DPSing through it coming very close to pulling aggro, and I probably would've without twisting it. I would never consider it for a long term solution, I felt really pressured by the GCD and watching Omen, enough so that it wouldn't be worth the marginal gains.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">One thing I've been trying recently, and I haven't really seen it discussed anywhere, is totem weaving (not my name for it, but I like it).  I basically use this macro:<br>
<br>
<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px">

</div>I speced into both reduced totem cost and mental quickness and found that when everything is going right with procs and timing, I can sustain totem weaving + flame shock every 12 seconds indefinitely.  If I run low on mana I can always just stop shocking or leave Windfury down until shamanistic rage is up again.<br>
<br>
My group is almost always me, a warrior, and three rogues.  Every so often we get a feral druid.  I've gotten no reports of windfury going down while using this macro (when I started I asked my group to pay attention to it), and my group seems to like it quite a bit.  I'm going off the assumption that the totem weaving alone would be more raid dps than me using that mana to spam shocks.<br>
<br>
I was wondering if anyone had any insight into whether this is truly a good idea.  Seems like a better alternative to the flame/earth shock rotation that seems to be the consensus.</div>

</div>While my raid leader doesn't encourage me to pull aggro and die, often times, on fights like VR its the only thing that can be done.  Have to love the Shaman's Feign Death.<br>
<br>
Also, up until now I haven't played around with totem weaving, I think I am going to mess around with the Windfury / Tranquil Air mix a bit and see if that helps out at all.  Honestly I think the mana could be better spent some where else, but lower DPS is better the no DPS I suppose.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

So if any of you is experiencing this kind of problem now, i'd suggest providing your tanks with link to some basic tanking mechanics forum (or some equip - I didn't believe Stigmata he has no threat problems at all on Maghteridon for example, but after our tanks got few items, its the same for me).<br>
<br>
Of course things get nasty on Void Reaver for example, but Big5 combo (BoS, TA, Subtlety enchant, Fetish of the Sand Reaver and Prism of Inner Calm) still works like a charm and I can go full damage.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Threat rly isnt an issue any longer imo, except for a few fights (for example gruul, morogrim, magtheridon) where its there for a reason, namely preventing the fight from becoming even more easymode than it already is.<br>
So for any encounter where you hit a threat-cap: just slow down your dps, its ok, its working as intended and theres no need for more of your dps to win the battle. The majority of current encounters however, does not suffer from any of these threat-issues - sadly enough they have other ways of capping our dps output to a level that is fitting for our role as support-dps.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

As for fights like Morogrim and Magtheridon, I never have problems with threat, ever.  I can push my dps to its max and don't have problems.

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->There is no such thing as hit that I can 'drop'. The correct amount of hit rating to aim for as an enhancement shaman is 'whatever happens to be on the gear'.<br>

<br>
Panny: I definitely agree on the +spellhit side of things, if I ever find myself in a situation where the guild lacks primary interrupters then Ill gladly respec to resto. However for now the extent of my interrupt responsibility is 'whatever you want' on Aran, and as such 3% spell hit works out to be nothing more than a 3% increase on the tiny 10% of elemental damage that I do.<br>
<br>
<br>
Nemaa: I definitely think its worth having a Subtlety enchanted cloak on hand. DPS cloaks are many and numerous, so I think it would be well worth enchanting every second cloak you get with 12agi, the alternate with Subtlety just to have that option.<br>
<br>
<br>
Malan: I think all mention of the 'golden ratio' of stats should be removed from your original post, it seems pretty much canon that hit rating should never be prioritised over or equal to strength and crit, regardless of gear levels.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I'm really curious how you guys are managing to do it, since I know that, for example, on Magtheridon I can go all-out without worrying about threat, which means I can shock every CD, which means I need to chug at least 1 mana pot over the course of the fight -- even with 1494 unbuffed AP, 6.3k unbuffed mana. I can only assume that the difference is JoW? (Or are you on a clicking rotation for Magtheridon? That would also do it.)<br>
<br>
Just to provide a contrary description of my experience on Void Reaver: I get to stay in through pounding (we brought a ridiculously low number of melee, like two, to our first kill last night) but I am threat-capped from just autoattacking + SS, so mana's not a concern there. (It might be if I had two piece Tier 5, as I would definitely take advantage of the instant-cast LHW on that fight. Even though it would increase my threat, I sometimes have to run out for pounding and/or pop a healthstone when I'm getting scared that I won't get healed.) I think if our 4th tank were better, I would not be quite so threat-capped, he really can't keep up with the first 3.</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->Keep in mind that I'm occupying what would otherwise be another DPS warrior or Rogue spot in a raid, so while I'm brought along to provide substantial buffs to the group, I'm also brought along because I smash face substantially well with the proper gear. If I threat cap halfway through a fight and then spend 20 seconds hitting with shit items, I'm now putting an increased DPS burden on the rest of the raid. A few seconds of lost buffs from my death seems like a better option than a large period spent with less DPS output because I'm waiting for a good threat lead. As long as it can be done safely there are virtually no repercussions.<br>
<br>
Wolflord - Not sure about something being "canon" just yet. There's still plenty of enhance shaman out there using daggers and other fast off hands, and flametongue on their offhand. See the WWS thread for many, many examples of this. I don't think its a bad thing to reiterate the "obvious" stuff about the spec.<br>
<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Keep in mind that I'm occupying what would otherwise be another DPS warrior or Rogue spot in a raid, so while I'm brought along to provide substantial buffs to the group, I'm also brought along because I smash face substantially well with the proper gear. If I threat cap halfway through a fight and then spend 20 seconds hitting with shit items, I'm now putting an increased DPS burden on the rest of the raid. A few seconds of lost buffs from my death seems like a better option than a large period spent with less DPS output because I'm waiting for a good threat lead. As long as it can be done safely there are virtually no repercussions.<br>
<br>
Wolflord - Not sure about something being "canon" just yet. There's still plenty of enhance shaman out there using daggers and other fast off hands, and flametongue on their offhand. See the WWS thread for many, many examples of this. I don't think its a bad thing to reiterate the "obvious" stuff about the spec.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">There is no such thing as hit that I can 'drop'. The correct amount of hit rating to aim for as an enhancement shaman is 'whatever happens to be on the gear'.<br>
<br>
<br>
Panny: I definitely agree on the +spellhit side of things, if I ever find myself in a situation where the guild lacks primary interrupters then Ill gladly respec to resto. However for now the extent of my interrupt responsibility is 'whatever you want' on Aran, and as such 3% spell hit works out to be nothing more than a 3% increase on the tiny 10% of elemental damage that I do.<br>
<br>
<br>
Nemaa: I definitely think its worth having a Subtlety enchanted cloak on hand. DPS cloaks are many and numerous, so I think it would be well worth enchanting every second cloak you get with 12agi, the alternate with Subtlety just to have that option.<br>
<br>
<br>
Malan: I think all mention of the 'golden ratio' of stats should be removed from your original post, it seems pretty much canon that hit rating should never be prioritised over or equal to strength and crit, regardless of gear levels.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</div>
<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->So what you're saying is that if my gear has a total of 50 hit rating on it, that that is the correct amount to aim for?<br>
<br>
If people nowadays are running around with anywhere from 80-120 hit rating, I would say that's a pretty solid number to go off of. By removing your +3% hit from talents, you'd need to stack more on your gear to get the same +hit% as everyone else, thus lowering your other stats.</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->Thats exactly what I mean. From the post it sounds like you're saying 'for every 1str/1crit rating you also want 0.7 hit rating' ie that you want to maintain a 'golden ratio' of stats. Whereas in truth we just want every damned point of str/crit we can get our hands on.<br>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->Im a new raiding enh shaman (formerly resto).  My stats are as follows: 1300 AP, 108 Hit, 22.5% crit.  (EDIT:  Here's my <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111110190757/http://armory.worldofwarcraft.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Durotan&amp;n=Gnipgnop" target="_blank"><b>armory page</b></a>.  Disregard my World Breaker.  I raid with Fool's Bane MH and Runic Hammer OH, both with mongoose on them.<br>
<br>
Given my current gear, should I get my +hit to 150 first and then worry about AP?  Should I get my AP to 1500 and then worry about hit?  In my meager mind, it would seem that adding +56 hit (7 +hit gems) would increase my dps more so than 112 AP (7 AP gems).  <br>
<br>
The lion's share of conversation about stat valuation in this thread pertains to an <i>already well geared</i> Shaman (2200 AP, 25% crit).  My question is, which stat first for those of us still in Karazhan epics?  And specifically, which for PvE boss fights..  I just finished putting all +8 hit gems in my slots to get my hit rating up to a whopping 168 rating.  Then I read the 2nd quote above and banged my head on my keyboard.<br>
<br>
So 150 +hit is the benchmark Enh shaman should shoot for, but putting +hit gems in my gear sockets is a waste?  Im having to resort to leather gear just to get my hit rating over 100, let alone 150-190.<br>
<br>
Here are the 2 scenarios for my current stats:<br>
<br>
<b>A.  All +hit gems in sockets</b><br>
1238 AP<br>
164 +Hit<br>
23% Crit<br>
<br>
<b>B.  All +8 str gems in sockets</b><br>
1350 AP<br>
108 +Hit<br>
23% Crit<br>
<br>
As an aside, this is my first post, so please forgive me if i've done something wrong <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20111110190757im_/http://images.cdn.elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":)" class="inlineimg"></div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->This weighting is on the currently tested maximum contribution for each stat. Lootzor doesn't do haste rating, so you'll need to consider that as well. HasteR is pretty subjective based on your other gear, since you don't want too much haste, especially if you have a dragonspine or BS mace; ideally you don't want to drop your hasted speed below 1.50.  For weapons it doesn't take speed into account, so always shoot for the slowest possible weapons you can get for each hand. These values don't consider set bonuses or sta/int, so you'll need to choose for yourself.</div>

Do you use KTM on Void Reaver or Omen? I haven't given Omen a shot yet but last night against Void Reaver I was #1 on KTM from about 40% -&gt; 0% and I was waiting for him to hit me and kill me just so I could ankh, but it never happened. I've just stopped worrying about agro on Void Reaver as KTM is never right, heh.</div>

		<div id="post_message_415087" class="post_message_underline">Yes, Void Reaver and Morogrim are encounters where threat for shamans is indeed an issue. And yes its always good to try to maximise your dps. But again I say encounters like that arent about dps, thats why blizzard made them so agro-sensitive. Furthermore, if were talking about morogrim and voidwalker were talking about 2 very easy encounters who dont require much effort at all (hes called Loot Reaver for a reason)... Its like totemweaving: sure its 'a way' to impriove your dps a little, but why bother?<br>
Id be curious what the difference in your damageoutput is between a Morogrim kill where you suicide-ankh and one where you go fullout but keep your agro always just below that of the mt (getting watertombed is a great way of agro-reduction anyways). Is it realy worth the hassle?<br>
<br>
I just get the feeling that some of the posts here claim that suicide-ankhing should be considered a 'standard procedure' for enhancement-dps, where imo its only suitable for a very limited number of encounters and even then it can hardly be labled as required.</div>

		<div id="post_message_415224" class="post_message_underline">On a fight like Void Reaver you definitely do not want to be holding back a lot. This is something we learned back when we were working on Broodlord Lashlayer. Being more careful with your threat and thus killing the mob slower will just ensure that someone pulls aggro and dies, probably mutiple someone's.<br>
<br>
Knock Away effects like VR's are percentage based, so the higher your tanks threat is, the more threat he loses each time he gets hit by Knock Away. What this means is eventually the threat of your tanks will plateau, and if the mob is still alive at this point you are about to have a bunch of people overaggro and die. The best way to not overaggro on VR is to kick the shit out of him before this happens.<br>
<br>
Normally on Void Reaver I go all out, including haste pots etc, sustaining 1000+ dps for the duration of the fight. Sometimes I'll pull aggro around 10%, but I am certain this wouldn't happen if other people were doing slightly more damage instead of worrying about aggro, because if I can go all out for 90% of the fight without overaggroing, every other class can go all out the entire time.</div>

Normally the MT doesn't benefit a whole lot from Windfury Totem because they will have a lot of rage(in some cases infinite rage) just from being hit by the mob. On VR you're going to have a couple of tanks that aren't currently being attacked, so the extra rage from Windfury is much more noticable to them.<br>

As far as I know Tauren at max melee range are still considered in melee range. Also, be careful with outranging the Pounding, because he can target you with an Arcane Orb there.</div>

So according to the formula, 1 CR = 1 STR = 2 AP = 1.43 HR.  Does that always apply, or does that only apply if your % hit chance is at a high level?<br>
<br>
The reason I ask is, I used a lot of Glinting Noble Topaz in my gear to get my hit rating up to the 204 it is now.  The formula noted for those calculations was with a 22% hit chance, and I'm at that right now (9% from talents, ~13% from hit rating, so roughly 22% hit).  Should I instead go back and socket with +8 STR or +4 CR/+4 STR?<br>

I was always under the impression that I should focus on hit rating UNTIL I got to 200+ hit rating, but this seems to suggest that's incorrect.</div>

- Average value of a swing = 350 hit/800 crit -&gt; 2 hits per crit ~ 1500/3 swings<br>

<br>
3% hit over 300 swings (150 per hand) =~ 8100 with VERY favorable conditions.<br>
<br>
Earth Shock:<br>
<br>
(From looking at a couple parses with my stats)<br>
- 850 average non crit shock, 1000 on crit (these weighted slightly lower then average)<br>
- 5% less damage would be 808 and 950?  (I'm not sure how the 5% multiplier works on crits)<br>
<br>
- 300 seconds untalented = 50 shocks<br>
- 5% of 50 for crit is 2.5 -&gt; assume 3<br>
- 47 shocks, 3 crit untalented<br>
- 83% base spell hit +3% from resto on a 73 mob -&gt;  43 shocks<br>
- Assume all 3 of our crit shocks crit.<br>
- 40 shocks, 3 crit untalented with hit chance calculated<br>
<br>
- 300 seconds talented = 60 shocks<br>
- 5% of 60 for crit is 3<br>
- 57 shocks, 3 crit talented<br>
- 83% base spell hit on 73 -&gt; 49.8 shocks<br>
- 46 shocks, 3 crit talented<br>
<br>
- Damage difference is 40*(850-808)+3*(1000-950)+6*850 = 6930<br>
<br>
<br>
Now, this is assuming a 5 minute uninterrupted period under optimimum conditions.<br>
<br>
- 300 white swings across both hands assuming optimimum windfury procs in the difference period.<br>
- 50-60 Shocks by using every cooldown.<br>
<br>
So optimum here is at about<b></b>:<br>
-- 60 swings/minute<br>
-- 12 shocks/minute (5s), 10 shocks/minute (6s)<br>
<br>
<br>
So here's the interesting part -<br>
<br>
The closest high dps uptime fight I can think of off the top of my head is probably Morogrim or Void Reaver, so I grabbed the top EJ parses and took Shabadu as an example:<br>
<br>
Morogrim: 342s presence (5.7m)<br>
- 262 white swings (45.96 swings/min)<br>
- 22 shocks (3.86 shocks/min)<br>
<br>
Void Reaver: 298s presence (4.97m)<br>
- 203 white swings (40.85 swings/min)<br>
- 29 shocks (5.84 shocks/min)<br>
<br>
<br>
This tells us that cooldown isn't necessarily an issue as much as either threat or other such conditions.  Or it's just really hard to maintain a full shock uptime.  My own numbers for fights aren't nearly as good on uptime as Shabadu's are, so I need to work on that, or wait till my tanks build aggro a bit faster.<br>
<br>
I'm still thinking this needs more analysis, as the amount of extra damage from the shocks, along with the faster cooldown when you have limited dps windows can make a significant difference I imagine.  Also, there are at least a couple fights where I'm on interrupt duty and it's made a noticeable difference.<br>
<br>
Anyway I have some work to do, so if someone wants to tear this stuff apart a bit more (as msot of these numbers are pulled out of my nether regions), please do.  This topic needs more discussion then off the cuff "resto is better because +hit", that's the same path people went down when we first got DW for gear in general.  My main view right now is elemental hybrid is better up to a certain gear point, and then the 3% hit will win out from a dps standpoint over extended fights due to AP difference.  Where that breakpoint is is the question.  Elemental is a flat 140+ dps if used consistantly, but will never scale upwards with enh gear.</div>

It's not as mindboggling as you think.  Granted, there are other factors such as weapon procs and shamanistic rage procs which make hit more important that sims/calculations show.  The thrust of the theory-born results *seem* to be correct, however, as people have reported good results by re-socketting from +hit gems to +ap/+str gems.<br>
<br>
As far as the formula you quoted, if it is truly intended to be an equivalency formula (and it looks that way), then sure, 25/22.  I'd probably edit it to assume you having kings, however, making it more like:<br>
<br>
1 CR = .9 STR = 2 AP = 1.02AGI = 1.43HR<br>
<br>
Again, assuming that was an equivalency formula.</div>

		<div id="post_message_415526" class="post_message_underline">I run with an abnormally high hit, simply because of the gear wow has shown fit to have drop for me. I could easily get rid of 16 hit, since I still have 2 dawnstones gemmed, but I'm trying to repay the costs of my epic mount so I haven't had the cash to regem them. I'll lose more hit once I break 3 piece ebon netherscale as well, which I see coming as soon as I get one better in either of the slots since I can craft BT/Hyjal mail in those slots.<br>
<br>
Shocking for me is pretty involved. I have to make sure not to eat Stormstrike charges so that the ele shamans we run with get the maximum benefit. Sometimes cooldowns sync up and you have to wait an extra second on a shock or stormstrike and that further messes with the rotation. I tend to give up Earthshocking entirely when I feel close on threat or am running low on mana waiting on SR.</div>

For those who are still wondering what sort of gains Windfury gives a warrior, the previous kill that Beatdown Brigade did was a week prior to my joining the guild. With no Windfury totem on the previous week he did around 850 DPS. This week's kill with me in the group he did 1250 DPS for a gain of 400 DPS from totems, bloodlust, and Unleashed Rage.</div>

I recently dropped herbalism and took leatherworking, it cost me close to 2k gold but i eventually got it to 375 and crafted some of the BT/SSC items, if you can get hold of the plans (assuming guilds on your server are in there) that might be worth doing.<br>

The items aren't cheap to make considering the price of the plans and a couple of the rarer parts, but will be nice upgrades.</div>

Oh, when we're on Void Reaver anyway, are you guys moving in and out of pounding, or are you letting healers take care of it?

</div>Yes, cow range is incredibly useful, on the arcane WW mobs in tk tauren can stand there and carry on hitting them without dieing, much to the annoyance of the rogues.<br>

There are so many instances when its really good, I have been told that nelf also have an increased range.<br>

@Nifty01 If you look at the WWS I linked its only "landed" SS i'm counting.<br>

But like I said the results are inconclusive since its such a small sample.</div>

</div>Yes those items are real, they're on the PTR for the 2.2 patch. <br>
Melee running out on void reaver is a good way to get your tanks killed by dragging an orb on them and prevents melee from doing any significant DPS. The fact that its survivable by guilds who can't kill Mag is a good indication that you should just suck it up. A resto shaman chain healing can almost keep all the melee alive by himself.</div>

Btw for the guy above, I added DFT to the trinket list, however its only valued at 70 AEP. You'd be better off with any of the new TBC trinkets over that one.<br>

Now the only question is, what other mats do these need? Several of them just say the need things like a Noble Topaz or a Living Ruby... but surely there is some other mat that makes these an "epic" gem pattern?<br>

</div>Cheers, ill try that sunday.<br>
<br>
Looks like JC got a little extra perk, not suprising since the trinket alone doesn't really make it worth taking.<br>
4x4 extra stats (for rogues) is quite nice, but doesn't really compare to what enchanters can have on their rings, unless they add unique recipes for the BT/Hy jewels as well. It's mostly useful for melee dps, since most casters or tanks fill their sockets with just 1 type of gem.<br>
Looks like they only have these for the pure gems (RYB) as well.</div>

</div>The leather chestpiece compares nicely with the Ebon Netherscale breastplate (the leather has slightly more dps stats, but not enough to make it seriously better than the netherscale's stam/mana advantage) which definitely puts it as an upgrade over the nightbane chest.<br>

I think the real gem is that cloak though, the same DPS as a Vengeance Wrap with 25stamina thrown in too. I guess thats why it costs four nethers (Im putting mine aside now in preperation).</div>

We need some modeling and/or testing to determine if the 'use it when its lit' or 'use it only when a WF cooldown has ended' is the best methodology. We'll need to know that the supposedly increased windfury procs are going to offset the 5% (or more) loss of Stormstrike damage by not using it every 10 sec.<br>

Edit - to clarify, we've had many people talk about using the "wait till I'm off WF CD" method, but nobody has provide any sort of modeling or testing numbers to actually back it up. All we have so far is anecdotal stories.</div>

From just an eyeball, that chest looks better than anything you can get before Hydross/Karathress. The cloak looks pretty solid too.<br>

WWS only shows newly gained buffs, and with a decent latency you can easily refresh power surge before (by a fraction of a second) the previous one fades.

Last night, in a bit of testing, the poison proc itself was counting for 2% of my damage (I wasn't using shocks, except to interrupt spells, as I was grinding).  I wonder how that compares to other buffs.<br>
<br>
Here is my armory to get an idea of where I am gear-wise, as that % would obviously be less if I was doing more damage otherwise:<br>

</div>As you mentioned the HWL Cleaver...I'm really interested in how this does against a 71.x 2.6 blue offhand or the FEB. Mainly because I PvP now more than I used to to get either the epic lvl 60 or blue lvl 70 weapon, yielding FEB at the moment.<br>
I don't really know which PvP weapon is better, though; arena offhand will still take a while to accomplish.<br>
Especially as I've read among the official forums that HW Cleaver is supposed to be better than the S1 arena offhand...<br>
<br>
<br>
/edit:<br>
@ Ilmater: These values are raidbuffed and are in no way off. 380 BS, 220 BoM, 196 SoE, +10% UR and you will probably be over the said 2200 AP.</div>

		<div id="post_message_421883">Hi, this is my first post here, been reading awhile.  I enjoy and learn from the posts.  Unfortunately I have a long way to go gear wise to get where most of you guys are.<br>
<br>
The question on ring enchants reminded me of a something I had searched for but not found regarding meta gems.<br>
<br>
<br>
I have pre kara gear but DW fel edged battleaxes.  AP is about 800 depending on where I am and what I am doing, crit about 20%   to hit gear about 5%.  So I am nowhere near where you guys are and my concerns are different but I hope to have those concerns in the future.  <br>
<br>
Anyway I figure I hit about 1 time a second in combat.  <br>
<br>
That means a ring enchant would be adding 2dps each or 4 dps for 2 rings.  My meta gem is +3 damage and chance of stun.   I looked but could not find information on the chance of stun on this site or information on the way the +damage on this gem compares to other meta gems.<br>
<br>
If I recall correctly about 14 AP is equal to 1 dps.  Each ring enchant is equivalent to 28 ap or 14 strength.  The meta gem leaving aside the stun would be 42 AP or 21 str.  This seems pretty strong to me but I have not seen anything about them.<br>
<br>
I am an enchanterer but use the +spell damage since we have not been able to get that far into kara yet.</div>

		<div id="post_message_421915">I would wager that most if not all groups have DPS warriors, certainly. Who is going to battle shout the rogues? (You have those, right?). Blessing of might is another hefty chunk. If you can only get one blessing, in general I would go with might. The exception being Hydross, lootreaver, and Leo, where salv would be a must. If you are pulling agro off your tank on things like mag, karathress, tidewalker, or lurker, I would take a serious look at your tank's threat generation before questioning yourself. (Or to make it a no brainer, use a druid.). <br>
<br>
You can and should also pick up AP buffs from food (20 STR food) and a Flask, depending on what you are raiding. You can also keep in mind that your enchants are a place to make up for lacking stats. If you need more AP, get crusader. It procs like mad on a shaman, and double procs are quite frequent. I checked the WWS from the last morogrim I did with double crusader, and I show myself gaining Holy Strength 24 times during the fight. It could be slightly higher due to refreshing procs, but that still puts it at 3 PPM. (The fight was 8 minutes.) But, I use Crusader to make up for a slightly lower (1400 ish unbuffed) AP because I have higher crit from gear (About 30%), and because I'm cheap- I specced enhance for a few weeks since we were long on healers and short on DPS. If your stats are the other way around, get mongoose.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Liking the work you guys are doing with the Haste rating, definetly lots of food for thought.<br>
<br>
The question I have, since my guild is currently working on Kael, is which legendary should I be using?<br>
<br>
Devastation vs. the infinity blade MH. Seems like I do HORRIBLE dps with the two-hander, and almost seems worth it to just use my regular set-up (Wicked Edge/2.6 S2 Axe) or switch the wicked edge for an infinity blade. The speed boost seems useful for running from Sanguinar to Telonicus, then to Kael to interrupt that potentially lethal first fireball, as well as running to eggs. On the other hand, I'd be running slower, but doing more consistent and reilable damage.<br>
<br>
I have heard Stig say on multiple occassions he uses Devastation, thoughts?</div>

	</tr>
	</table>
</div>I use the dagger simply because the axe is the last weapon we kill whereas the dagger is generally the second.  ( It's supposed to be the third but the rogues and I would rather kill the dagger than the healing mace.. &gt;_&gt; )  I've been really satisfied with my dps output with it.  Although we're still learning the fight so I find myself throwing a ton of heals during the hectic transition from the weapons to the advisers so I lack the mana to dps at full.<br>
<br>
Boy would I love to see the big numbers that axe could generate.  Every once in a while I run around in raids with my Gorehowl out just to see big numbers, it puts a big smile on my face <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070922124737im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":)" class="inlineimg">  But that is for after we get the fight down pat.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Do the math yourself, it's easy. (DPS of MG - DPS of Decap &lt; 50% * (DPS of MG - DPS of green); you'll find the MG Cleaver goes thus goes in the OH by a wide margin.)</div>

</div>No, it's not that easy at all... since they're the same speed, the MH should proc WF much more often, and thus its dps becomes favored.  Then you have to factor in the gain from SS.  I'll try to do this on my own:<br>
<br>
169 avg dmg of green OH attack<br>
253.5 avg dmg of MG Cleaver attack<br>
239.5 avg dmg of Decap attack<br>
<br>
So every SS, that's:<br>
<br>
253.5 + 169/2 = 338<br>
239.5 + 253.5/2 = 366.25<br>
28.25/10 = 2.8 increased dps on SS<br>
<br>
Increase from MG Cleaver in OH, Decap in MH: 10.85 flat dps, * some increase for flurry.<br>
<br>
Now, given that the MH procs WF more often, that's 28 more damage every WF proc (14 average damage difference every hit, x2 hits).  Since it can't possibly proc more than once every 3 seconds (obviously that's over-rated), that is less than 10 dps increase, so you're right, I'd say there's no way it could be better than Cleaver/green combo.<br>
<br>
But I was also kind of curious how close it was, because if it's a couple of dps difference (not scalable), then I'll let someone else have it.  Also, I'm wondering if I'm accounting for everything (so many freaking procs on chance with shaman that I always for get things) so I can make the same calculation for a 71.7 dps OH.  Assuming my math was right above, then you would even prefer Decap/Cleaver to Cleaver/Harvester.  The math comes out to 1.9 dps increase from SS, 7.5 dps from the greater added dps, and I doubt the 28 extra damage from every WF proc on the MH (and lower dps from every WF proc on the OH which I left out above), it's still a good dps increase.<br>
<br>
So unless I missed the Decap/Cleaver combination would be prefereable to anything short of two Cleavers. <br>

		<div id="post_message_421996">You don't need hit to increase your rage generation, you will only need hit to have more white damage/windfury proccs. <br>
That are big differences from warrior (rage) and rogue (combat potency talent) points of view. It might only be more important if you can achieve a dragonspine trophy.<br>
<br>
All three stats scale well, but attackpower gives you the best reward (check the linked thread for further details and formulas) at this certain point. You will hit over 9/10 attacks with 22% hit (including 5% dodge), but crit will help you further with flurry uptime and attackpower with manaregen from your shamanistic rage talent.<br>
<br>
To the 2200 ap discussion, Malan added some explanation, maybe you should reread posting #1 from time to time or have a quick look at this quotation for finally clarification:<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic"><b>But 2200 AP is a *lot*, how can I achieve that?</b><br>
Well lets take a look at buffs.<ul><li>MotW (w/o Talent) - 28 AP</li>
<li>Strength of Earth (w/ Talent) - 200 AP</li>
<li>Blessing of Might (w/o Talent) - 220 AP</li>
<li>Battleshout - 305 AP (w/o Talent)</li>
<li>Strength Food - 40 AP</li>
<li>Elixirs/Flasks - 110 AEP (Agility elixir) or 120 AP (Relentless Assault)</li>
</ul>2200 - 28 - 200 - 22 - 305 - 40 - 110 = <b>1297 AP</b> that you would need on gear, and this isn't even accounting for unleashed rage! Its <u>not</u> hard to achieve 2200 AP in a raid, and once you factor in Unleashed Rage, Blessing of Kings and people putting talents points into these buffs, you will easily exceed 2200 AP.<br>
<br>
That said, Shaman need all stats in as large of quantities as possible. The above is not a rule, there are no magical numbers that we can point to of "you need this much hit/crit/AP." You need lots of each, probably more Crit than Hit according to models, but still lots of each.<br>
<br>
Current theory is holding that we may not need anywhere near the hit cap like we previously thought. Reference this thread around pages 12-14-ish for discussion of hit rating. Many of us are running with significantly lower levels of hit rating and seeing very large DPS gains.</div>

</div>The axe has better stats in my opinion (allmost 2% hit and a bunch of stamina), which you might also want to weight into your comparison. For you, as an orc shaman, your racial with +5 axe weapon skill comes into account, to.<br>
It should really depend on the ppm of the mace weapon procc (it's only 120 damage per applying, not counting resists). <br>
We could really need some data mining from Stigmata, Sebudai or another fast progressing shaman or fury warrrior here. Eg can two proccs stack like lifesteal enchant?<br>
<br>
The mace should be harder to get (rogues could also want it, but the axe it not really interesting for hunters).<br>
<br>
I guess, your upgrade from an arena weapon to the axe on your mainhand might be noticeable, but shouldn't be a clear jump. "Upgrading" from a blacksmith weapon to the axe could be a downgrade in the worst case (losing 0.1 attack speed). But i think, from our knowledge point nowadays, the mace should allways be superior in your offhand then the axe and any other choice do.<br>
<br>
Is a combination of 2.8/2.8 really better then 2.6/2.8 regarding stealing wf proccs from your mainhand will need further ingame testing (or java simulations, but those data should be taken carefully).<br>
Chosing between weapons with same statpoints would be an easy decision (the slower one of course!), but in this special situation, it will really depend on the mace procc.</div>

With the bow debuff and DW'ing the damage output is insane, waiting for 2+ seconds between attacks is horrible in my opinion, so using the 2 hander is not an option.</div>

</div>-Question mark icon helps a lot, the icon of the macro will be replaced to the spell what's next<br>
-reset=8 helps to put down windfury in time (before the effect goes off from the weapons) but it works only if you don't spam the macro. It resets only after 8 seconds of the last push.<br>
-If I can't use stormstrike in time I press "alt" and the hotkey of the macro so I skip a stormstrike and jump to the first spell: Windfury Totem<br>
<br>
This works quite well for me, I've been using this for like two weeks. My melee group is very happy and it is an upgrade to my party's dps, though my dps goes lower. Of course I can't use totem wtisting on every fight, but there are quite a lot where it's a big boost.<br>
Malan: if you keep spamming this macro and you can cast stormstrike every time it has cooled down the wf effect will be always up on the weapons of your group, I tested it and it's working fine.</div>

</div>First time posting heh.  Our first VR kill last night, first night of us wholeheartedly attempting him, seemed people had issues dodging giant balls of electricity our actual first night :P<br>
<br>
With the tank threat on that fight, I swapped to rockbiter just to see if it made a difference.  While I had windfury up, I hit the threat cap very rapidly and jsut stood there.  Rockbiter seemed to work better because not only could I control my threat generation to a much finer degree, but I was able to just keep swinging if for nothing else than the Light heals.<br>
<br>
Horrible threat cap on that fight, but that is how I crept around it.  I believe i swapped my offhand to windfury midfight to get more light procs, but eventually threat was too much, and had to battle ankh just to stay alive (ironic huh), swapped windfury on both weapons, and went balls out till he died without pulling agro.<br>

My weapons at the time are Black Planar Edge (2.7 attackspeed)in the MH and the Season2 Arena weapon (2.6) in the OH. Today I got myself the Mace "FoolÂ´s bane" (2.6) from Illhoof and now I am wondering if the 4 dps deficit to my Black Planar Edge is compensated by the 2.6 attackspeed which better matches my OH so my MH WF proccs are not eaten by my OH. Or is the little slower attackspeed of my MH of no importance and I have leveled blacksmithing for a reason? <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070921183157im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":)" class="inlineimg"><br>

This is one of those problems that can't be properly simulated though, because sims don't screw up. They react much faster than human players do. Actually gaining DPS by this method would probably take some practice.

</div>The rule I generally go by is if I think there is more than 1.5 seconds left I just go ahead and SS, otherwise I wait.  I've gotten pretty good at guessing the lag on the windfury timer.  As long as the little ball that I go by turns red as I SS, I'm happy <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070921183157im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":)" class="inlineimg"><br>
<br>
I think there is a line between the loss of SS dps caused by waiting and the increased DPS from more windfury procs due to guaranteeing that the SS has a chance to proc windfury.  1.5 seconds seems like a good compromise.</div>

		<div id="post_message_428624">For quite a while now we have worked with the concept that 'small haste effects which take weapon speed from just above 1.5 to just below it will decrease dps'. This is due to interaction with the WF cd timer, and was shown via sims, but I have not seen any ingame tests done to see the actual effects.<br>
<br>
So, out I went to do a bit of testing on blasted lands mobs. I used 2 'Sergeant's Warhammer of ***' (2.1 speed, and level 12 greens, hence low dps numbers) as the weapons and first used 104 haste rating, the second set was done with 73 haste rating. The 104 haste rating set had a ring and trinket slot empty, the 73 had some green items in them to make sure no AP was lost when the Band of Devastion was removed. I also did not use my helm, as it has a haste proc meta gem. Total change in stats between the 2 sets - first set has 31 more haste rating than second, all other stats equal.<br>
<br>
First set, 42 minutes 8 seconds (2528 seconds), damage done: 1000054 of which 59.5% white, 40.5% WF. Speed with flurry = 1.47. <br>
Total dps: 396  of which white dps: 235, wf: 160<br>
<br>
Second set, 43 minutes 17 seconds (2597 seconds), damage done: 1000194 of which 59.3% white, 40.7% WF. Speed with flurry = 1.51.<br>
Total dps: 385 of which white dps: 228, wf: 157<br>
<br>
Now clearly, as we all know, just dealing 2 million total damage is not enough to really conclude anything with the extreme randomness of shaman dps, however this does seem to show one thing, even when crossing the '1.5 speed barrier' with a small gain in haste rating we still see a gain in dps. WF dps was close enough to call as no change, clearly not the drastic loss the sims had lead us to believe, and if there is a loss it would then need a less than 31 haste rating change, basically a value so small as to be of no consequence (smallest single haste gain I could find was 26 rating). <br>
<br>
The white damage however is clearly boosted by the presence of the haste, a 3.07% gain in white dps from 2.95% of haste looks to be a correct value. Total dps went up by 2.86% when going from 1.51 speed (flurried) to 1.47 speed (flurried). It would be nice to see some more data collected, but from this atleast it seems there is no point at which haste is bad at all, and it is infact a very strong stat for us no matter what our current flurried weapon speed is.</div>

I personally think that lag has something to do with weapon hit times, so it might be a slightly better test to have something like 1.4 flurried speed versus 1.65 flurried speed.<br>
<br>
In any case, those results are very interesting - thank you for them.</div>

I was wondering if there was any reason I should get the <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070921183157/http://wowhead.com/?item=31965"><span  ><span class="purplename">[Merciless Gladiator's Cleaver]</span></span></a> over the <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070921183157/http://wowhead.com/?item=32026"><span  ><span class="purplename">[Merciless Gladiator's Pummeler]</span></span></a> for my new OH.<br>
<br>
I only ask because the axe gets mentioned alot, and the mace does not - someone please enlighten me if there is actually a reason that the axe is better? <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070921183157im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":)" class="inlineimg"><br>
<br>
Also I would appreciate it if someone could have a look at my armoury page and see if I'm doing anything wrong? Personally i'm pretty happy currently - Bare in mind we're about to kill Gruul, So thats about the the level of loot I have access to. Planning on swapping out +Hit trinket with the Bloodlust Broach soon, and also the Hourglass trinket with the Dragonspine Trophy when nubcakes drops it. <br>
Currently also grinding heroic mana tombs for the uber totem.<br>
<br>
Thank you all in advance!<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I am assuming that when you guys keep saying Arena OH, they are referring to <b>One Hand </b>and <i>not</i> the <b>Off Hand</b>.  Am I correct in saying this?  Because shaman typically want the slowest possible OH weapon.<br>
<br>
And also, my guild had asked me about getting dual Battle Master enchants for the raid.  But I read that the group heal generates threat.<br>
Is this true, and have any shaman had experience with BM enchants?</div>

</div>I'll be honest, your raid leader should be shot for thinking like that.<br>
<br>
Not only does it <br>
<br>
A. generate 50hp or some ridiculous low amount <br>
B. It's a proc that doesn't go off all the time  and very sporadic<br>
C. Generates increased threat to you<br>
D. Doesn't increase your dps in the slightest in fact it hinders you because you could be using Mongoose or +20STR enchants on 2 weapons.<br>
<br>
BM is a cute enchant but you'd want it on a FAST weapon so it would proc ridiculous amounts to make it even quasi useful (which it isn't) but since you are going with 2 SLOW weapons it's a waste.<br>
<br>
Smile, nod your head, and put mongoose on your weapons and throw down a healing totem. There you just did one better.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Well, quite honestly unless my guild can provide most of the mats - I can not afford it on one weapon, no less x2.  <br>
<br>
And honestly to some extent I have been slightly confused about haste benefits on shaman, I read one place it says haste is great for shaman, but then it also says when we are hasted - that we actually have a dps lose because of the WF cooldown.<br>
<br>
And, I also read that while mongoose x2 can stack, but I read the haste will not stack on top of flurry.<br>
<br>
So if this is incorrect, please set me straight.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I used to include sta/int in my lootzor, but there are two problems. First, it's a very subjective valuation, not at all objective like the calculated numbers we're working with from sims and modeling. Second, as has been said, it's often irrelevant. When I started boosting my AP more (as a result of the modeling in this thread) I found I could easily refill from Shamanistic Rage and maybe an Unstable Mana Potion (which I have plenty of from daily questing). Once you have enough mana to drop totems and shock for two minutes until Shamanistic Rage is back up, more mana is worthless. Similarly, if you have enough stamina to survive random AOE ability #34, if your healers are decent, more stamina isn't providing you with additional value -- and, like you said, almost every piece, rogue or hunter, has stam on it anyway.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Sebudai, I see you are using Rising tide in MH and Syphon on OH. I used to do the same because I tought Rising Tide would eat more wf procs and it lowers my DPS. Yesterday I tried out and swapped them and I saw much bigger white hits/crits. I never saw 3400 wf crits before... I think its better to have this 0.2 slower weapon in MH and have Rising Tide proc a bit more wfs than having the faster but lesser end damage axe in MH. My white hits are 50-55% of my damage, windfury attacks are only about 30-40%. Anyway I'll go to blasted lands and test it on the weekend.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</div>I haven't gotten around to figuring out which way is better yet. The main reason I had Rising Tide in my MH is because of the orc racial. I don't know which way is better. I'll probably try switching it to Syphon MH in the near future.<br>
<br>
On a different note, I just realized that I've been doing the math incorrectly for haste rating. The 36 haste rating on Valestalker Girdle comes to 40 'points', not 32.4.<br>
<br>
-Edit-<br>
Oh yeah, I forgot one of the reasons I've been puting Syphon offhand is in my current gear setup when I have Flurry and Bloodlust active it puts the Syphon at 1.47 speed. On a lot of fights I get Bloodlust multiple times, so I figured it might be best to put the axe MH. I don't know for sure, though. I'm just guessing.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>It's just sad there are non-set items that are superior for every slot. At least T5 had a great helm and gloves, T6 is consolation prizes across the board. Hopefully at some point they'll go through and re-itemize without the mp5, it's frustrating that they haven't learned from the mistakes with T4 and T5 though.<br>
<br>
On an unrelated note, Thottbot now has pawn/lootzor style item scoring. The item search also gives you the option of only listing high scoring items, it's nothing new but since lootzor still doesn't include haste rating it's useful. The scores it gives are pawn style rather than the <i>normalized</i> values lootzor gives.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_432455 intelliTXT"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->On that subject, I threw in all the best of slot mail pieces I could find into excel and calculated the difference between non-set pieces and Skyshatter including the 4 piece bonus.  What do you guys think?  If you take the formula at face value, it's better to get the non-set pieces and forget about Skyshatter.  However, when I plotted it out like this, I noticed that the non-set pieces, being obviously hunter gear (they even look like hunter gear from what I gather) they have very little +hit.  Now I know +hit has a relatively low value, and I've proven earlier in this thread that dropping really low isn't bad as long as you replace it with other stats.  On the plus side though, going with non-set means more agility vs. crit rating, which means you will gain dodge too.  Also, the non-set pieces are easier to get as they are sooner in progression and you would have to compete with less people (hunters only vs. warriors and other shaman specs)<br>
<br>
So what do you all think?  Is it better to go with the non-set?  Or is there some reason to try and get the Skyshatter at least to the 4 piece (probably go with non-set legs still, as they are the most gain)?<br>
<br>
BTW, I used epic gems in the gem slots for the calculations, so 10 str for red, 5str/5crit for yellow, and 5str for blue.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Back to the equivalencies, I'm using this formula:<br>

</div>So I think taking the ratios (ie dividing them all into 1) of these numbers would give the the associated weights for plugging them into lootzor?<br>
<br>
So then weights are:<br>
CR = 1<br>
STR = 1<br>
AP ~ 0.456<br>
HR ~ 0.699<br>
Haste ~ 1.11<br>

Well unfortunately without the haste rating as of yet. Sorry if this is obvious to everyone, I'm just putting it down as I found the equivalencies confusing for a bit as my gear choice process basically revolves around finding weights to put in lootzor.<br>
<br>
I'm starting to think personally that assigning some weight to stam is worthwhile. While I think that stuff like fel leather is a good gearing up option there aren't many boss fights (nor trash clears) I can think of where I would be happy to be kited out in items that haven't spent some of their item budget on stamina. I quite often find myself swapping for example  gauntlets of the dragonslayer for fel leather gloves to boost my survivability in trash clears and aoeing boss. While armor can in almost all circumstances be considered useless I'm not so sure about giving stamina a weight of 0 or not including the dodge component of agility in it's item weighting.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

My opinion is to always take an upgrade when its available. If that means that a Tiered Set item is better than what you have, even though there is 'better' available, I'd still take the upgrade. I never wait for a drop and take things when I can. Look at the lootzor item listing for our currently accepted stat weights. T5 and T4 are at the very bottom, right next to each other. I think that Blizzard may have just declared set items to be the easiest item to get and therefore should be the least beneficial. That's contrary to how most players feel though - set items are "cool" and have bonuses and a unified look to them. <br>
<br>
Post 873 -<br>
I think all you've done is normalized the values to 1, its still the same ratio as if you hadn't done that. I just edited the front page with some material that Rob gave me and things should make more sense now. It also has a correct lootzor link on it finally.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>It's worthwhile until you're through Karazhan I believe.  As you need to prioritize stam gear until you can sit over 8500 or so buffed.  After that you don't need to look at it any more.  All the gear you'll get from 25 mans will have enough stam on it to keep you in safe territory.<br>

The hidden cooldown will still render one swing after every WF proc unable to proc windfury, which will give you a 16.6% proc rate.<br>
<br>
Mainhand Proc Rates: 2.6/2.6 WF/WF vs 2.6/whatever WF/FT:<br>
<br>
Assume permanent flurry and no other haste buffs, so those Merciless Gladiator's Lolarenaweapons drop to 2.0 speed.<br>
<br>
<br>
WF/WF: If each hand has a 36% proc rate, each hand will proc WF every 2.77 eligible swings. Figure in 1 mainhand swing locked out from a mainhand proc, and 1-2 mainhand swings locked out from an offhand proc, and you have your mainhand proccing windfury once every 4.77-5.77 swings.<br>
<br>
WF/FT: WF procs every 5 eligible swings, and you lose 1 swing per proc to lockout. WF procs every 6 swings.<br>
<br>
<br>
Theoretically, enchanting WF on a slow offhand should actually increase your mainhand proc rate, although anyone who can prove my math is bad is welcome to do so.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">There are lots of pages here and lots of discussing going on so...<br>
What are the values I should put into pawn? and what is intellect / stamina / spirit in this all?<br>
<br>
Person #1: 2500HP <br>
Person #2: 2800HP<br>
Both get hit for 40-80 (average) and 90-120(crit) <br>
Rest of the stats is all the same.<br>
<br>
Won't the person with the most HP be able to deal more dps as he will most likely stand longer?<br>
<br>
Intellect and spirit seem useless damage-wise unless you count in the amount of heals you can squeeze in, the longer you stand... the more damage you are able to produce.<br>
<br>
If I am dead, I can't do dps .. simple lol.</div>

</div>In a fight where you get constant damage end don't get healed you might be right.<br>
Stamina is a stat to consider when you're way below 10k hp fully buffed, but after that point it just isn't important anymore. Bosses will onehit you regardless of your HP, and anything else has to be healed anyway.<br>
Your manapool works simmilarly. All you need is a manapool that is sufficient to keep up constant shocking and also big enough so that your manaregen with SR is never wasted. Beyond that point you don't have to care abaout intellect anymore.<br>
Spirit as a stat is worthless for every shaman, if you need manaregen get items with mp5, but as an enhancement shaman you should always be able to reg enough mana with SR alone.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

	</table>
</div>Let's go through point by point, shall we?<br>
<br>
<i>-How WF is effected by both avoidance and mitigation from armor assuming level 73 MoB with 5 Sunders</i><br>
<br>
I assume a 23% damage reduction.  That is more than fair to FT, considering most people are claiming an average of 20% damage reduction after sunders.  I included dodges, so there goes the the avoidance issue.<br>
<br>
<i>-Flametongue ignoring armor</i><br>
<br>
My sim does indeed use melee mitigation through armor, and allows flametongue not to be affected by armor.<br>
<br>
<i>-Flametongue with Nature's Guidance +3% spell hit</i><br>
<br>
I modeled this with <b>ZERO</b> resists.  I essentially gave natures guidance a 16% spell hit boost.  If that's not more than fair to flame tongue, I don't know what is.<br>
<br>
<i>-Flametongue doesn't proc when you miss, possibly leading to hit rating gaining some importance in a WF/FT set up? I don't know</i><br>
<br>
And guess what - the sim doesn't proc FT when the attack is avoided or missed.  Pretty neat, eh?  ;-)<br>
<br>
<i>-Flametongue benefits from any fire debuffs stacked on the MoB</i><br>
<br>
Fair point, but I think the nature's guidance part more than covers this.  However, to be complete, I just looked at the FT number, divided by 1.13 (16% resists, but 13% after natures guidance), multiplied by 109% (imp scorch), then multiplied by 110% (Curse of elements), then multiplied by 105% (crit rate), and the difference comes out to be 7dps.  So, Those two numbers should be closer by 7dps due to resistances, nature's guidance, curse of elements. <br>
<br>
<i>-Flametongue always scales well with haste whereas too much can negatively effect WF</i><br>
<br>
Another good point.  I have no answer to this other than to say, it's a corner case most of the time, and the simulation I used took it into account.  It'd be different for a person with lots of passive haste or item-based haste procs.  My model never had the OH (with WF) dropping below 1.5 speed.<br>
<br>
<i>-Stormstrike DPS, higher with WF/WF Slow/Slow, but by how much?</i><br>
<br>
The model shows takes this into account too.  I use a 10.5 second delay between stormstrikes due to an assumed lag.<br>
<br>
<i>-Could using WF/FT versus WF/WF possibly land a net increase in MH WF procs, which could help scew the results in favor of FT? (I know you get a net loss in WF proc rate, but would you gain more overall MH procs that if the OH was "stealing" some of those procs, resulting in a bit more MH WF dps?)</i><br>
<br>
This is all covered in the simulation, and was part of the testing.  Here's the breakdown since you're interested:<br>
WF Dps Slow/Fast: 124 WF MH Seconds per Proc: 7.81<br>
WF Dps Slow/Slow: 128 WF MH Seconds per Proc: 8.06 (if you caught an early revision of this, i copy/pasted the wrong numbers from excel, hence the stealth edit)<br>
So, even though the OH was stealing some, the increased flurry uptime, and the 20% to 36% jump was enough so that you had *more* MH WF in the same time period when OH'ing a WF weapon.  <br>
<br>
================<br>
<br>
So, does this cover most of the concerns to the point where you consider it to be closer to reality than you originally thought?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Yes, "Assuming those values above are correct"  :-(  Unfortunately I made a large mistake in it (see my post above).  However, I don't think those numbers are anywhere near the be all / end all of the debate though, as weapon damage, crit scaling, flurry scaling, etc, are all in favor of windfury.<br>
<br>
However, if you had your current stats, but had 10 000 AP instead of your current AP, FT would almost definitely win out.<br>
<br>
I really wish I had my updated sim available though, because I don't remember what I changed in it between 2 months ago and today.  I know the today version is more correct, but crushing my laptop with a truck prevents me from seeing how much of a difference it makes.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				</div>
				<div style="font-style:italic">And the point that I was making is that there is so much stuff that happens to counteract the benefits of FT on the offhand that WF/WF is probably still (significant) benefits to sticking with it.<br>
<br>
As for the AP bonses and its scaling, consider the following:<br>
<br>
100 increase to AP used on OH FT:<br>
100 * 30% * 10% = 3 dmg per swing.<br>
3 dmg * 86% = 2.58 (resist rate, mitigated 3% by nature's guidance)<br>
2.58 * 1.09 = 2.81 (full stack of improved scorch debuff)<br>
2.81 * 1.1 = 3.09 (Curse of elements)<br>
3.09 * 1.05 = 3.25 (5% spell crit rate)<br>
3.25 * 1.15 = <b>3.74</b> (elemental weapons)<br>
<br>
100 increase to AP used on OH WF:<br>
100/14 = 7.14 (inherent AP scaling, NOT affected by OH penalty we now know)<br>
7.14 * 1.1 = 7.85 (weapon mastery)<br>
7.84 * 1.4 = 11 (elemental weapons)<br>
11 * 1.35 = 14.85 (good crit rate)<br>
14.85 * 80% = 11.88 (20% armor reduction)<br>
11.88 * 2 = 23.76 (2 WF attacks per proc)<br>
23.76 * 94% = <b>22.33</b> (6% of WF will be dodged)<br>
<br>
In neither case have I factored in white hits/dodges, because neither of these can proc when the base attack doesn't land.<br>
<br>
So...<br>
<br>
From AP scaling alone, you have 3.74 dmg/swing increase for FT, and 22.33 dmg/proc increase for WF.  Put another way, for AP scaling only, you break even in damage between the two when you get more than 6 OH swings per 1 OH WF proc.<br>
<br>
Now add in crit scaling, base weapon damage scaling as you get gear, increased flurry uptime, and (this is minimal) increased UR uptime, and WF still looks more attractive to me.  Maybe I've missed something significant (such as main hand extra procs due to OH not eating any), but I think Slow/Slow will rule onwards.<br>
<br>
I'd love to be proven wrong in RL testing, however, because high dps fast offhands are (so far) much easier to obtain than slow ones.<br>
<br>
====================================<br>
IMPORTANT EDIT:  Thanks to aroma for catching this - I was wrong in that the AP bonus from gear does indeed get halved by the OH penalty.  This then becomes much more in favor of FT than it originally was.  The actual comparison should be:<br>
<br>
3.74 dmg/swing increase for FT, and 11.16 dmg/proc increase for WF when you give a flat 100 AP bonus to each set up.<br>
====================================</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</div>This, I think, is starting to get much closer to an accurate model. However, I have to ask if this takes into account the 100% proc chance on hit of FT versus 15-18% proc chance on hit (average) of WF? And there is still the question of lost DPS from Slow/Fast when it comes to Stormstrike, and the potential gain in DPS from more MH WF procs from OH FT.<br>
<br>
Also, the (minimal) loss of Flurry and UR up time from losing the extra attacks that WF provides would almost certainly be more than made up for by the increased number of crits / unit of time being landed by the now (much) faster OH weapon.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

1.) UR uptime isn't affected much at all, we're 95% uptime anyway<br>
2.) Flurry uptime is a slightly more complicated case but not that much different<br>
expected wf proc time while flurried is: wspeedflurry/0.2 (for mh only), for a 2.6 weapon this is 10s, so the wf cd percentage is actually 1- (10/13), which is 23%.<br>
so we actually can assume that 2*(1-(1-0.2)^((10/13)*3)) = 0.80 swings are expected to be added to our flurry uptime calculation, for DW the value for two 2.6s weapons would be: 1.16 <br>
for 35% crit the difference in uptime is: 85% vs. 87%<br>
3.) Stormstrike as a haste factor is a difference of maybe 10% between a fast weapon and a slow weapon<br>
<br>
Anyway I can say more about this, as soon as I've modelled it into my code.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">====================================<br>
IMPORTANT EDIT:  Thanks to aroma for catching this - I was wrong in that the AP bonus from gear does indeed get halved by the OH penalty.  This then becomes much more in favor of FT than it originally was.  The actual comparison should be:<br>
<br>
3.74 dmg/swing increase for FT, and 11.16 dmg/proc increase for WF when you give a flat 100 AP bonus to each set up.<br>
====================================</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</div>So as aroma said, it's 11.16 dps not dmg per proc.<br>
Assuming optimal (unrealistic) 20% proc rate, that's 11.16/5 = 2.226dps added over time.<br>
FT is 3.74 dmg * 1.05 (shadow priest misery) giving 3.927 dmg per swing.<br>
<br>
Assuming a fast offhand of 1.4spd (I actually never looked at fast OHs, do they go faster than this? if so FT is better..) that's 3.927dmg every 1.4sec or 2.805 dps.<br>
<br>
FT seems to scale significantly better then (at the 35% crit rate)? <br>
<br>
Any other factors that have yet to be included?<br>
<br>
EDIT: Also -target armor items would be useless with FT, while WF would scale nicely from them.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>This holds true purely for white attacks untalented only. After taking into accounts extra attacks from Stormstrike and Windfury Attacks and also the semi constant 30% speed increase from flurry you come a lot closer to double the expected number of procs. Hence its a lot closer to +30 STR than +15 which is alot better than potency.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I think you are right in that WF/WF will be more procs of windfury in a given amount of time compared to single WF, but you are sill stealing MH procs every once in a while and lowering the average damage of WF by a lot, so its hard to judge without detailed theorycrafting if you can make up the lost damage by less WF procs with FT on offhand if you are increasing the average damage done by WF and adding in the damage done by the FT proc on your offhand.</div>

</div>What I wrote out above covers mainhand windfury only, and should account the offhand "stealing" mainhand procs.<br>

I'm not just saying you should get a windfury proc every 4.77-5.77 mainhand swings; I'm saying you should get a <i>mainhand</i> windfury proc every 4.77-5.77 mainhand swings. (You'll also get offhand procs at about the same rate, but that's not what I'm interested in.)<br>
<br>
To put it another way, you will see more than twice as many total WF procs using slow/slow WF/WF compared to WF/FT, and half of those procs will be mainhand.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Hey Malan,<br>
<br>
Yep I'm here. I'm the author of Shamulator.<br>
<br>
There are indeed some significant changes coming in the next version which can affect the results. Specifically,<br>
<br>
- Dualwielding should grant a 36% WF proc chance (in current version it's 20% no matter what)<br>
- When weapons swing simultaneously, randomly choose which hand gets to swing first<br>
- OH 50% damage penalty was incorrectly penalizing the WF Bonus AP portion of that damage<br>
- Attempts to make Flurry better mimic ingame Flurry behavior<br>
- If MH SS swing misses, OH SS swing should not be attempted<br>
<br>
The last 2 have a pretty minor impact on final overall DPS, but the first 3 can change things up significantly. I'm not sure if these changes would affect the relative DPS you are seeing when varying +hit/critchance.<br>
<br>
FYI I will be releasing the next version soon (and will post here when it's ready). <br>
<br>
I'm currently hung-up on a possible error with same speed weapons lowering DPS compared to using a slightly faster OH weapon. Look back in this thread (page 49) if you'd like to read about it and illuminate me.<br>

</div>This talent was weak none or less even before the nerf. Actually I'm not really suprised about the change. They already tried it two times in 1.06 (?) test and tBC Beta. Somehow the change vanished in tBC release, maybe even unintented (earthbind anyone? :P). In some way, it helps enhancement shamans, because it will close the dam gap between us and the other melees. <br>
<br>
And as someone, who also plays a warrior, I always found harmstring spamming a bit strange. ^^</div>

</div>I didnt think of really approaching rogue level. Because of how they scale with haste and their itemization advantages, they still will leave us behind with every item tier. But it will close the gap a bit and not just between us and them, but also between ferals, casters, hunters and them. And for warriors, they shouldn't get past us, both classes should be at around the same level.</div>

</div>I thought the performance of a hybrid PvP/PvE MS Warrior in raids was a bit excessive compared to Fury considering how good they are in arenas. This is a fairly huge damage nerf for 2H warriors (somewhere around 10% from what my guild worked out), but less for Rogues/Fury Warriors.</div>

		<div id="post_message_446097">Hello, i've been reading a lot of information from here to educate myself on the wonders of Enhancement shaman and i'm still missing a lot of information and i'm extremely uncertain of my gear about how to maximise the dps.<br>
<br>
I'm trying to keep something like 130-150 hit rating, aiming to keep 25% crit and going for 1500AP now after that going for more crit and more crit as it comes. I've been doing some testing on lowering my hit and so on but i'm not sure if it helps a lot or am i just gimping my stats by going all the wrong ways.<br>
<br>
So, my current stats are:<br>
AP 1463<br>
Hit 123<br>
Crit 26.04%<br>
<br>
If i change my gear a bit i can go:<br>
AP 1404<br>
Hit 157<br>
Crit 27.32%<br>
<br>
Which one would you as the experts think be more benefitting since i'm really having a hard time finding a real solution to this as to which one would be better DPS wise or are they both almost equal and that's why i'm not seeing anything magnificient.<br>
<br>
And another, the main idea that i wanted to ask from the people in here. I'm currently using <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302203839/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=28767" target="_blank">The Decapitator - Items - World of Warcraft</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302203839/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=27747" target="_blank">Boggspine Knuckles - Items - World of Warcraft</a> as my weapons, and since Decapitator has only crit as a pure stat and offers the funny use stat. I've been thinking if using <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302203839/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=28657" target="_blank">Fool's Bane - Items - World of Warcraft</a> would be more benefitting ? <br>
<br>
If i gem it with 8str i get +44AP -3CR, where as 14AP is 1DPS i would gain 3.1DPS from the AP and the crit would be quite meaningless in this case i think. Now the Decapitators use hits for a medium of 500, has a cooldown of 3min so this something like 2.7DPS.<br>
<br>
But the Fool's Bane has roughly 6DPS difference in theyr initial weapon damage. So because the AP etc would be almost equal i'm thinking would it be better to use Fool's Bane rather than Decapitator since the AP gain would also go directly to WF and thus give me a nice buff in that department also.<br>
<br>
I know i'm probably micro-managing a bit too much but i'm just wondering if i should use it since i believe i wont get the Netherbane that fast from Al'Ar just yet.<br>
<br>
Hopefully this isn't too big of a post or something, cheer for everyone and thanks very much for all your theorycraft <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302203839im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":)" class="inlineimg"></div>

		<div id="post_message_450445"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Hello. This is my first post, but ive been reading this forum for quite some time now,<br>
especially this thread as i am playing a shaman myself. Thanks all you guys for<br>
working out all these facts. I am particularly taken with the AEP calculations. Because<br>
of that, i created a small app that allows me (and you) to compare items based on<br>
those values without being in the game (pawn) or calculating. <br>
<br>
I do not know if such a program already existed and if so, it will most likely be better<br>
than mine. But well, give it a try if you are curious. Note that I created the program for<br>
me mainly, i know that it works for me (shaman) on my pc, but i did not really test the<br>
other template features (it allows you to create aep values for nearly every stat, not only<br>
those relevant for us shamans.) and yea, the code is sloppy. if you want it to crash,<br>
it will crash. but normally it should work. if not, tell me.<br>
<br>
I currently do not update the program as it suits my needs. However, if some of you guys<br>
(more than 3) like it, tell me what to change, tell me about bugs, suggestions and<br>
i will see what i can do. does anyone need a good xml itemdatabase btw? thats the<br>
main problem currently as the allakhazam database does not support haste (i think).<br>
<br>

<br>
If you are curious, you can find further facts, a small howto and more screenshots <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091117111952/http://www.desperate.at/daep" target="_blank">here</a>.<br>
<br>
i can not create a new post because i do not have enough posts. if some of you guys<br>
think that it is worth it, you can do so (but link to this post please).<br>
<br>
oh yea and: USE AT YOUR OWN RISK! (the program does not do anything fancy and<br>
it will not try to open or alter any file except the templates.xml file.)<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

The best we can tell is that 1 point of - Armor seems to be worth 7 item budget points (this was stated 2-3 pages back) and that its AEP value would be something between 1 and 2.2. Not very conclusive, but it would seem to indicate that its a decent stat to have. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20091117111952im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/wink.gif" border="0" alt="" title=";)" class="inlineimg"><!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

The <b>only</b> potential drawback to -armor is that on very low armor mobs, it's possible for it to be worthless since -armor has no effect once a mobs armor is reduced to zero.  However, I don't think this is currently an issue for any significant raid bosses.<br>

In fact, the recent testing information in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091117111952/http://elitistjerks.com/f31/t14321-rogue_combat_vs_hemo_point_inflection/" target="_blank">Hemo</a> thread would seem to indicate that we (the theorycrafting community) have underestimated the value of -armor for quite some time.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

On the topic of grounding totems on vashj, I was charged with the same responsibility.  I have guardian totems in my build because I pvp occasionally and like them for that purpose.  It just happened to be useful in raiding too.  I never encountered an instance where grounding was needed and I wasn't able to place it in time.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_450582"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Here is the prove, that shows that "average" AEP’s use is wrong for the majority of stat combos possible in game by a big margin.<br>
<br>
I took data from empirical testing by Disquette and used following algorithm:<br>
For each Hit/AP combo with given crit  remember recorded dps.<br>
Find combo that is the previous one with +100 ap and get new dps.<br>
Find the difference and divide it by 100 to get dps increase per point of AP.<br>
Do the same for +50 hit rating step (these are minimal steps presented in collected data) and find dps increase per point of HR.  Divide dps per HR by dps per AP to find local AEP ratio for the initial Hit/AP combo.<br>
Here are the results:<br>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20091117111952im_/http://infostore.org/file/3841475/3088676/Hit%20AEP.jpg" border="0" alt="" onload="NcodeImageResizer.createOn(this);"><br>

<br>
The first graph shows actual AEP numbers.  Look at how big standard deviation (expected difference from the mean) is = 0.77.  Mean = 1.1, it is not surprising that it is different from “generally agreed upon” 1.3 as the later can be easily obtained with another covered range of stat combos.  It proves again that these general “average” AEP values provide nothing for specific stat combos that players come up with.  Second graph shows probability distribution function for AEP.  Each column is 0.2 range – that is a significant change for the weight value.  43% of combos fall into range where actual AEP is below mean by 10% and more, 41% are above mean by 10%, only 16% of combos are within 10% difference from mean.  So, there is 84% chance over the whole range of covered combos, that average AEP will be different from your actual AEP by more than 10%.  <b>There is a solid 54.5% chance that actual AEP is different from the suggested by more than 30%</b>.  That is for one pair Hit-AP only.  If same holds true for other pairs, one can <i>speculate</i>, that the probability of at least one weights being wrong by 30% or more is 1-0.455^(number of non-linear dependant attributes).  There are 4 such major attributes (AP, Hit, Crit, Haste) so it becomes 96% chance that at least 1 of the weights will be more than 30% wrong.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
If I'm understanding this correctly (and given my record there's a good chance that I'm not), you're stating that there is a 96% chance that when comparing Item A to Item B using Pawn or Lootzor, that Item B will incorrectly appear to be an upgrade, because at least one of the stats is valued incorrectly for the particular stats that the player has *at that moment in time*?<br>
<br>
If that's the case... does it even really matter? Essentially if a guy with 800 AP, 50 Hit Rating and 15% Crit looks at an item that was valued using AEP that came from a guy with 2200 AP, 150 Hit, 30% Crit - why should he not value that item as an upgrade against a "meta set" of itemization that represents what he would eventually have? ie, I base my upgrades against the expected outcome of all my upgrades, my final set of expected gear.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				Sunder Armor is equally effective against any amount of armor, assuming that the armor of a target is at least equal to the armor reduction of a stack of Sunder Armors. This is counter-intuitive, as the amount of damage reduction % decreases with each armor point. However, the effectiveness of each 1% damage reduction increases the more you already have.

I'm currently trying to work out future gear options, stormrage signet, BT trash neck, madness of the betrayer and soul cleaver.<br>

What I'm thinking is, if reducing X mob Y armor then the minimum benefit would be Z additional damage, something like Morogrim has pretty high armor, where as Solarian seems to have very little, possibly none?<br>

<br>
Can you do some regression analysis on the variables (AP, crit, hit, etc) and derive a set of variable functions for us to use in our simulations?  Barring that, we will have to stick to the linear models we have.  You seem to have the mathematical prowess to accomplish this.<br>
<br>
On another note.  Even if you derive variable functions, they will still need to be applied from the gear backwards as in the lootzor or Tornhoof's model.  The reason is that although you may discover the optimal combination of stats at specific values (maximums), the gear may not exist to accommodate that specific maximum.  This is one of the reasons that I liked Tornhoof's closed simulation so much.  It removed all of the uncontrolled variables and tested existing gear combinations to discover the optimal combinations of gear available to you at that time.  I'm speculating, but I think a combination of variable functions and a closed model like Tornhoof's will be the closest we can come to our goal.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Look at the pretty line I get when I look at AP in steps of 400, against larger steps of the increased hit and crit rate<br>
<br>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20091117111952im_/http://www.discofiend.com/wow/ShamanCalc/AP-graph.jpg" border="0" alt="" onload="NcodeImageResizer.createOn(this);"><br>
<br>
Out of the 36 datapoints, we had:<br>
Mean: 0.23 Dps/AP<br>
StDev: 0.02  (9% of the mean)<br>
<br>
It looks like we have a really great model for AP, over a huge range of hit/crit values!  Furthermore, since 30% is being accepted as the "close enough" barometer for values by Yo!, I'll use that to test the 36 datapoints I have.  Exactly 0 of them fall outside 30% of the mean, so I guess I have a perfect data set.<br>
<br>
It even works out like we'd expect, with increasing returns on AP as our hit and crit rate increase (shown by the upward trend in the graph).<br>
<br>
Statistics to the rescue indeed.<br>
<br>
Now, back to the big_test.xls sheet that i'd uploaded so that people could review it, did everyone just ignore the lines on the bottom of my data set where I included:<br>
<br>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20091117111952im_/http://www.discofiend.com/wow/ShamanCalc/deltas.jpg" border="0" alt="" onload="NcodeImageResizer.createOn(this);"><br>
<br>
I specifically put in those calculations in the big results test so that people would know how widely varied the data points were.<br>
<br>
So, let's look at those big hit rating swings.  My biggest mistake, probably, was making the steps too small.  If you use larger steps, you get nicer numbers to look at.  They make pretty graphs like the one above.  It has so much variation between runs (that's how shaman work), that sometimes you get flukey things.  When you were going through the result data, did you really think that increasing hit rating should decrease dps?<br>
<br>
I really hope not.  Yet running the sim, there were instances of that.  It's yet another thing I specifically pointed out in a separate column so that people would know what they're looking it.  So, instead of wallowing through the minutae just so you can exclaim "it's all wrong and worthless", how about you take some time and figure out if, in a broader context, it's meaningful?<br>
<br>
Here's an example.  I took three of the AP levels (I chose 900, 1700, 2500, because they're evenly spaced and are WAY out of each other's range, so they should satisfy your complaint about gear levels resulting diff APE ratings).  I then eliminated half of the hit rating steps (increasing them by 100 instead of 50).  This should give me a better picture, and again, should address your notion that APE are not valid across gear ranges.<br>
<br>
Now let's look at the pretty picture:<br>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20091117111952im_/http://www.discofiend.com/wow/ShamanCalc/dps-per-hitrating.jpg" border="0" alt="" onload="NcodeImageResizer.createOn(this);"><br>
<br>
No, it's not nearly as nice as the AP graph, but it's still pretty consistent.  Much more than the 70% variability you were discussing.  In this case, the average dps/hitrating = .275.  The stdev = 0.084 (for a stdev 31% of the mean).  This time, using your "30% variation is ok" concept, 71% of data points fall into the acceptable range.  If I look across all gear levels, and say that each hit rating is worth just a little bit more than one AP, I'd be pretty accurate, based on the two charts I have posted above, which cover almost the entire range of gearing choices.<br>
<br>
Statistics can say what ever you want them to, pretty much.  I could probably argue on Yo!'s side and say that all this theorycraft in here is utter garbage, at best meaningless to the shaman community, and at worst ill-advising people.  I just need to find the right data that makes graphs that appear horrendous or beautiful.<br>
<br>
That's why I'm glad that the theorycraft has been born out in actual game scenarios, with multiple people of varied gear-levels saying "i changed out my hit gems for AP or crit gems, started focusing more on crit and AP, and my dps went up significantly".<br>
<br>
I don't know how shaman dps works in many instances.  There's all sorts of things that are hard to account for.  But just like looking for a coin at night, the first places you check is where it's already light, and you hope you find it there.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_450948"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->When looking at the armor range on bosses it really isn't that large a spread, just about every boss I've seen using targetarmor falls between 3500 and 5500 armor - 25% to 35% mitigation.<br>
<br>
As for hitting 0 and -armor losing it's value the lowest I've seen is Essence of Suffering which seems to average about 1700 after sunder and FF, add in CoR and you'd still need -900 to hit 0. Since the most a shaman can equip right now is -301(-601 with MotB procced) it's really not an issue.<br>
<br>
As for AEP values I was hoping to get some feedback on my speculation here: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091117111952/http://elitistjerks.com/447956-post1339.html" target="_blank">http://elitistjerks.com/447956-post1339.html</a> It seems to me that we know how much -armor changes our dps since we know the armor mitigation formulas. The only variables are how much it costs in the item budget, which we don't know but can estimate and what are good values for boss armor which we have a pretty decent idea of. So if we assume 7 -armor for 1 item point and bosses around 4500 armor, I think it's safe to say that on a shaman with T6ish stats(I use my own) it's worth about 1.9(1.8 for 5500 and 2.04 for 3500, 2.34 on EoS btw).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

In other words, even though you get a larger percentage of mitigation going from 1,000 armor to 2000 armor than you do going from 10,000 armor to 11,000 armor, the actual amount of damage reduced by that 1,000 armor class gain remains the same. <br>
<br>
I always assumed that armor penetration would hold true to this, just backwards. In other words, 300 armor penetration would increase damage by the same amount against a target with 10,000 armor as it would against a target with 1,000 armor. The 1,000 armor target would lose a larger percentage of mitigation obviously, but the increase in damage done to the targets would remain the same.</div>

	</table>
</div>I remember a lengthy thread on the conquest forums a couple years back basically said the same thing, and at the time it was probably true, but it doesn't appear to be anymore. <br>
<br>
The formula on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091117111952/http://www.wowwiki.com/Armor" target="_blank">Armor - WoWWiki, the Warcraft wiki</a> show a non-linear curve on armor mitigation. You can check it plugging random armory profiles into that formula and you'll see the mitigation % matches it exactly.<br>
<br>
As an example using that formula if you assume a 1000 hit and then a 1000 armor reduction we'll get the following results:<br>
10000 armor = 513.56 <br>
9000 armor = 539.82 <br>
Difference = 26.26<br>
<br>
2000 armor = 840.73<br>
1000 armor = 913.48<br>
Difference = 72.74<br>
<br>
So unless I've missed something(which is very possible), the armor the mob starts with is a large factor in determining the value of -armor.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>The thing you missed is that you based your example on a static 1000 damage hit.<br>
<br>
Lowering the Armor makes the % of reduction go down, just like adding armor makes it go up. The value of -armor will go up as your base dmg go up.<br>
<br>
For example:<br>
<br>
If your target has 50% DR and you can push it to 48% with -armor then thats a 4% increase in dps.<br>
<br>
So if you push at 800 dps, then you'd be at 832, for the duration of the -armor. So as your base DPS will go up, so will the value from -armor.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I want to add some numbers to the armor penetration discussion to support Morelis claim.<br>
<br>
Using the same formula from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091117111952/http://www.wowwiki.com/Armor" target="_blank">wowwiki</a><br>
<br>
<i>Levels 60+ DR% = Armor / (Armor+400+85*(Level+4.5*(Level-59))) </i><br>
<br>
x / (x+400+85*(70+4.5*(70-59))) = <br>
x / (x+10557.5) =<br>
<br>
you: lvl 70, hitting for 1000 damage, attackspeed 1.0 <br>
enemy1: lvl 70, 30.000 armor = 73.97% reduction or 260.3 dmg/hit<br>
enemy2: lvl 70, 20.000 armor = 65.45% reduction or 345.5 dmg/hit<br>

enemy6: lvl 70, 01.500 armor = 12.44% reduction or 875.6 dmg/hit<br>
<br>
<br>
Debuffing the mob with sunder armor, expose armor, fearie fire or wearing armor penetration gear for an amount of <b>-1000 armor</b> will net you those numbers:<br>

enemy5: lvl 70, 01.000 armor = 08.65% reduction or 913.5 dmg/hit <br>

<br>
enemy1: 3.3% dmg increase from 1000 armor penetration<br>
enemy2: 3.4% dmg increase from 1000 armor penetration<br>
enemy3: 5.1% dmg increase from 1000 armor penetration<br>

enemy5: 8.6% dmg increase from 1000 armor penetration<br>
enemy6: 9.0% dmg increase from 1000 armor penetration<br>
<br>
Bossarmor is about 5.000 to 8.000 on average defore debuffs are applied, that's why a missing fearie fire will hurt your melee close as much as a missing pot or minor attackpower buff. Armor penetration could help here a lot and it's a decent pvp stat while fighting cloth wearer with 500 resilence. But there's no way you could say 1 AP = -12.5 armor pen on general or average.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>2 minor upgrades will be not enough for the guy in the example in order to change AEP from 5.5 (that is what local AEP is for him) to 1.3.  He happened to be way off from stat combo that values hit rating as 1.4 AP, namely he has too much AP and not enough Crit/Hit.<br>
It does not mean that he <b>has</b> to change his equipment towards the combo where there is 1.4 ratio to improve his DPS, however boosting his DPS by choosing +hit instead of +ap will drift his local AEP from 5.5 towards 1.4 and at some point beyond that.  <br>
<br>
Look at this another way - how valuable additional +hit rating is when person reaches hit cap? Is it 1.4 ap? Or is it more like 0.0?  And it is not changing suddenly like 1.4, 1.4, 1.4 1.4 oops 0.  It is drifting towards 0 the more + hit rating you have given AP remains the same (still with a big downfall at the end).  Hope this helps.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
To the "Yo! Discussion",<br>
You are using 12% hit instead of 22%, that's a large difference. It's around hitting only 8 of 9 out of 10 attacks and should result in heavily lower ur/flurry uptime.<br>
I still believe, that 22% hit is a little too highly set for a good aep comparison, it's to close to the hitcap (that's around 25.5 to 27.5 if i remember correctly) while you can "easily" obtain 1000 more ap and/or 10% more crit.<br>

Malacort<br>
What weapons are your rogues wielding? With S2/T3+ weapons, doesn't matter if they are sword/mace/dagger your rogues should get better results from Wf with a combat specc. Only a multilate rogue could really prefer grace of air over windfury for reaching ~ 45-50% crit raidbuffed with the ashtongue trinket buff (that result in a lot more cp from seal fate and ruthlessness/relentless strikes talents) and deadly poison allways up.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Sure, that is why I got expected different AEP value from what would be with more hit.<br>
And that is exactly why "<i>average</i> AEP" provided poor test guy with wrong suggestion for choosing gem. And that is why it should not be used by him.  And you feel right that it is not worth reaching hit cap while you can "easily" obtain 1000 more ap and/or 10% more crit because local AEP (true AEP for the specific stat combo) will favor AP and Crit much more than "<i>average</i> AEP".  So, following what <i>average</i> AEP suggests is evil.

</div>This and Yo!'s last post are things I agree with.  I think of it as building a square, in many respcts.  If your objective is to creat the maximum area, and your choices are to lengthen side x or side y, generally you're going to increase the area more by increasing which ever one is already shorter.<br>
<br>
Now, we're not dealing with a square, but the attributes (hit/crit/haste/ap) can be seen analagously to one for the purposes of qualitative but not quantitative comparison.  If you're really low on hit compared to the other dimension, you're going to get more bang for the buck increasing hit.  This is a lot like what stigmata said in a recent post about his gear.<br>
<br>
My problem with Yo!'s initial posts were that they made it seem like you got nothing out of assigning the average AEP values.  Personally, I agree that AEP changes as you gear up differently.  However, my original reason for writing the sim and finding results was to confirm that hit was the be all and end all of enhance shaman statistics - it was the conventional wisdom, but I hadn't seen it proved anywhere, so I wanted to see why.  It was quite the shock to find it so underwhelming at certain gear levels.<br>
<br>
I still think that it has valid uses - and for a starting shaman with average gear, it gives you a direction to aim for.  Once you get to the boundary cases where you've used it to the point that you have 0 hit rating and 1800 AEP, I think it's certainly very worthwhile to re run the sims (or just comprehend it internally) to the point where you have to realize that you're going to get much more of a return on hit than you initially did.<br>
<br>
back to the rectangle.  Here's how I see shaman decision making 4 months ago based on the gear available then: It's H wide by AP tall.<br>
<br>
When H and AP = 10, the area is 100.<br>
<br>
It turns out that for $5, you can increase H by 2 or AP by 5.  At that point in the general shaman world, people were choosing to increase H by 2 units instead of AP by 5.<br>
<br>
Fast forward to the current day, when that rectangle is 8H wide by 20AP tall, for an area of 160 square units.<br>
<br>
Now for the same $5, increasing AP to 25 gives you an area of 200.  If you were to increase the H dimension by 2, however, you'd have a total area of 200 also - they've normalized.<br>
<br>
AEP is good for shaman over a very wide variety of gear.  However, when you get to the extremes that AEP will lead you, you will indeed start making sub-optimal gear choices.  This is confounded more by the fact that the higher AP goes with raid buffs (people are now raiding with 3k+ AP often with buffs) that hit is going to become more and more important (as will crit, for that matter).<br>
<br>
I don't disagree with Yo's statements taken by themselves.  What I have disagreed with is that for the vast majority of shaman, the current AEP ratings would misguide them.  Gear up through kara, when using AEP, won't let you neglect hit, so shaman have been ok.  Accordingly, when I ran the sims, note that AP stopped at around 2500 and crit around 31%.  Now that times have changed, and we can see where gear is, a new version should probably be done (esp with haste gear, which was unforseen by me, which would more strongly value +hit).  It's impossible to use a constant set of values that is good for everyone, but I think that the ones that have been used to date have helped a lot of shaman from sinking into a trap of "Max +hit first, and then worry about your other stats".<br>
<br>
As I've said repeatedly, if tornhoof can get a closed form of parameterized attributes working, that would be my preferred solution.<br>
<br>
Yo! - I hope you realize that if I've sounded harsh, it's not because I disagree with the notions you have set forth.  I just don't want people thinking that as they grow from dungeons to heroics to SSC/TK, they have been making bad choices.  I think the AEP are ok up through that level.  Now that we are beyond that, there probably does need to be a rejiggering of values (and preferably in a parameterized way).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Sure. But you neglect to address the thrust of my argument: static AEP values are useful at "reasonable" gear combinations. Sure, if you just have 2800 AP and 0 hit rating, that won't be as good as 2600 AP and 100 hit rating even though the AEP values say otherwise. But <i>there's no set of gear which would allow you to obtain 2800 AP and 0 hit</i>.

				Look at this another way - how valuable additional +hit rating is when person reaches hit cap? Is it 1.4 ap? Or is it more like 0.0?

				<div style="font-style:italic">This and Yo!'s last post are things I agree with.  I think of it as building a square, in many respcts.  If your objective is to creat the maximum area, and your choices are to lengthen side x or side y, generally you're going to increase the area more by increasing which ever one is already shorter.<br>
<br>
Now, we're not dealing with a square, but the attributes (hit/crit/haste/ap) can be seen analagously to one for the purposes of qualitative but not quantitative comparison.  If you're really low on hit compared to the other dimension, you're going to get more bang for the buck increasing hit.  This is a lot like what stigmata said in a recent post about his gear.</div>

Saddly, it can not be used instead of step-by-step simulations because the mathematical expectance Mf(x,y) is different from f(Mx,My).<br>

If one starts nude with 1 hit and 0 ap and has a budget of 100 Drgagon kill points that he can spent somehow 1 DKP per one stat point - he will achieve max damage output by spanding 49 points towards Hit, 50 points towards AP and the remaining point towards any stat. This will result in 2500 damage. If, for some reason this person thinks that AP is always better he will spent all 100 points on AP scoring 100 damage.<br>

By only comparing hit and ap, there is some point (0% hit), when ap won't benefit you something, to. <br>
But we are not talking about the minimum stats, we are talking about some much more common stats. The extremes might happen once in a blue moon and are a mathematical phenomenon, but aren't important in this case.<br>
<br>
No person will  spend all his dkp to gain 100 other ap, the margin is so much smaller..<br>
He maybe lose 1-2% hit or crit of 15-30%, but shouldn't drop under some minimal stats.<br>
Maybe we should describe them in the beginning post, to.<br>
<br>
Every shaman will need x% hit to keep up ur &amp; flurry with two z speed weapons.<br>
Every shaman will need y% crit to keep up ur &amp; flurry with two z speed weapons.<br>
<br>
Using x=15%, y=25% and z=2.6 while proofing this with any of the simulators should be enough. <br>
Of course, the set aep might not be true for some data examples somewhere far away from this, like x=5%, y=50% and z=4.0 ..<br>
<br>
edit: to your last post, you are saying the average aep aren't right because the people don't have the same average stats after farming karazhan? Of course, there will be differences. But i really doubt, for adding 2% crit and 100 ap from better gear your stats would change to something odd like <br>
<br>
Haste Rating = 3.7<br>
Strength = -4<br>
Crit Rating = 7<br>
Agility = 5<br>
Hit Rating = 3<br>
Attack Power = 24<br>
<br>
All what happen is, that it might change to something like<br>
<br>
Haste Rating = 2.3<br>
Strength = 2.1<br>
Crit Rating = 1.9<br>
Agility = 1.7<br>
Hit Rating = 1.6<br>
Attack Power = 1.05<br>
<br>

Lootzor could need some updates, i think. There's no season 2 gear listed except the shoulders and some items have still not updated their socket boni.<br>
Because of the high value of some leather helmet's (ignoring the far better agi/critdmg meta gem) and the fel leather gloves, i started valueing stamina a little bit, too.<br>
You won't want to play with raidbuffed 8.000 hp at trash or other bosses than ebonroc, so it's not that important.. -&gt;<br>

		<div id="post_message_452666"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Hi guys, first of all i'd like to say thanks for the glut of helpful information here. I switched to enhancement about 2 weeks ago and am currently trying to gear up to be useful in raids, your compilation has helped immensely.<br>
<br>
On to my question and i hope it hasn't already been asked (i've read as much as humanly possible, but didn't spot this specifically anywhere.<br>
<br>
I'm currently using <a id="itemlink" class="q3" style=" font-weight: bold;" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091119072934/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=28392" target="_blank">[Reflex Blades]</a> Main hand, and am struggling to find anything offhand thats slower. My current off hand isn't showing on the armory, but its a 2.60 green axe (65.6dps if i remember right) and i'll be picking up the High Warlord axe this weekend, but even that is only 2.60.<br>
<br>
Given the problems with fast OH, do i want to just ditch reflex blades altogether and grab another high warlord axe? its .10 speed diff but from what i'm reading it'll still gimp me badly.<br>
<br>
How do the strike mechanics work for weapons with matching speeds? is having 2 2.60 speed weapons a problem for windfury or does the main hand weapon always take priority?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_452700"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I actually don't understand the whole AEP discussion at all, we have several more or less valid models of shaman enh dps. Each and every model has a certain weighting towards one or more stats, my model is more fond of hitrating and hasterating than of critrating. <br>
<br>
My current model rates the attributes at a 2.2k AP,22% hit, 25% crit gear for:<br>
1CR = 1.18HR<br>
1CR = 1.045Str (incl. BoK)<br>
1CR = 0.794 HasteRating<br>
<br>
Actually I don't know why anyone should care about AEP values for unbuffed non raid envionments, there is no reason to use AEP if you never have BoM, BoK, Battleshout and Elixir/Flask.<br>
<br>
Now to the mathematical finer points of the whole discussion.<br>
your attributes/stats are not linearly independent, +crit increases +ap to a certain degree and +haste (if you take flurry as a haste rating (which is a valid assumption)) etc, the only <br>
stat which is practically independent of everything else is AP. Other than that I do agree that the calculated AEP values are only valid for a fairly small window.<br>
<br>
To me it is kinda obvious that it is not possible to compare two individual items on your equipment based on AEP, it has to be obvious for me, otherwise writing my program would have been lost time <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20091119072934im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/wink.gif" border="0" alt="" title=";)" class="inlineimg"><!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

What i meant by priority was swing order from the start of an attack, rather than procs, as in both weapons don't strike simultaneously even if the speed is the same. If this is the case then MH would have the first chance to proc windfury, even though both are the same speed.<br>

		<div id="post_message_453002"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Disquette, Yo! et al - perhaps what we need are 3 (or more) sets of AEP that establish some baselines. ie, while leveling 1-70 with pretty minimal AP/Hit/Crit available, here's the AEP you need. For 70 normal/heroic/KZ instances, use these other values. Once you hit XYZ values of stats, roughly SSC/TK time frame, use these. After you've geared in SSC/TK and you're at the extreme top end of stats, now use these other AEP for Black Temple and Hyjal.<br>
<br>
@Jelu - 2H is relegated to PvP for the most part, and even in PvP it may not be the clear winner anymore. DW is superior for PvE purposes. The days of shaman swinging big huge 2H's is pretty much over. It varies enough from a rogue either way.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

@Blackmoon: I just started again in July and I've been 70 for about a month now  gearing up so i feel I'm on the same level as you and my little advice is to get the level 60 High Warlord 2.9 speed weapon as it's still serving me since around lvl 64 . <br>
Just yesterday I managed 735dps according to wws so it is indeed a more than viable weapon and above all very easy to get. I think it would out-damage the level 70 version assuming you get Battleshout in the raid. <br>
It's so good I don't feel I'm working towards an upgrade in Runic Hammer but rather I'm working just to test if it's better. <br>
<br>
On the Karazhan weapons, get what drops first. I was lucky enough to get the Paw almost as soon as I dinged 70 and it helped alot for farming and grinding to gear up (skill up leatherworking). To be honest, I don't really find much difference between the Paw and the Decapitator.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Dragonstrike has a rough 26.6% proc from a 33.3 minute testing (this factors in some where but not sure where).<br>

</div>I wouldn't assume 30%, I think that is just what original testing showed.  If someone actually tested for 33 mins and saw a 26.6% uptime that's about as accurate as you can get.  As far as the Wicked Edge vs Dragonstrike argument, I really don't know.  The haste nerf sucks and I'm probably going to be dropping Dragonstrike if/when they buff BT weapons as they did SSC/TK.</div>

</div>It is not proc rate, it is proc upkeep time. Proc rate for Dragonstrike is 9% = 2ppm*2.7speed/60sec.  AEP value of Dragonstrike was calculated as (2ppm * 10 sec / 60) * 313.7AEP = 33.3% upkeep time * 313.7 AEP = 105 AEP but this is not taking overlapping procs into account.  It was assumed that overlapping leads to 30.6% upkeep time that leads to 30.6%*313.7 = 96 AEP.  If you have 26.6% upkeep time - it becomes 83 AEP for you.  If you will put on some haste items the upkeep time will be higher and AEP value of the item for you will be higher.  <br>
<br>
This happens to all items with procs - their AEP value depends on how much haste you have.  Similarly, AEP value for 1 haste rating depends on how many items with procs you have.</div>

Of course you can speed yourself up with temporary buffs to that range and even way beyond, fastest i have seen my 2.60 weapons hit was 0.78, (I´m troll with berserking), but its just temporary buffs and that gap is way too narrow to worry about with temporary buffs.</div>

</div>Haste is definitely worth increasing if you already have a lot of AP/Crit.  Refer to cube/square examples several pages back.  Armor reduction - well, it depends not only on what stats you already have but what boss you are fighting against.</div>

		<div id="post_message_465405">First time post here, I was wondering what the benefits / mechanics behind using two 2.8 speed weapons would be,  I looked through the topic for a while, but after spending some time doing so, I realized the chances of me finding what I was looking for was going to be a needle in a haystack.<br>
<br>
I've seen a lot of information regarding the use of a 2.6 - 2.8 speed weapon together in different combinations; but haven't seen much regarding the use of two weapons of identical speed, to be more specific, Using x2 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080115232042/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=32262" target="_blank">Syphon of the Nethrezim</a> vrs.

<br>
It would make a lot of sense, the ability to get both weapons to be as close to 1.5 speed using haste, the extra flurry tick from Identical Speed, and the maximum damage from Stormstrike, but I was wondering, all the posts I've seen that mention using identical speed weapons never have it as their focal point, I was wondering if their was a conversation on it regarding shamans specifically (I read the flurry post, but this forum hasn't talked about it at all from what I've seen)  Maybe I'm missing something obvious, are there any hidden side effects to using them as opposed to mixing weapon speeds (Less Mainhand flurry consumption from using a faster weapon, wf desyncing your weapon speeds?)  <br>
<br>
I guess what I'm asking is, between another syphon or rising tide, which should I pick up as my next weapon and why, any help with this is extremely appreciated.<br>
<br>
Shikka asked this question in post #914, but it only had one or two directly corresponding replies, and I didn't grasp why matching weapon speed seemed like such a bad idea.</div>

</div>For my decision, I looked at the alternatives to each weapon. Dragonstrike's haste proc is fairly unique, with no other available mainhand for Shaman. Meanwhile, Wicked Edge of the Planes has competition from any weapon with comparable stats/DPS, such as a Merciless Gladiator's Cleaver.<br>
<br>
I'm not sure how much the proc will be worth after the haste nerf, but I've found the maces to be superior to weapons with higher DPS/better stats (memory's a bit hazy, but I think it was <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080115232042/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=28437"><span  ><span class="purplename">[Drakefist Hammer]</span></span></a> vs. <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080115232042/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=28657"><span  ><span class="purplename">[Fool's Bane]</span></span></a>).<br>
<br>
Also... I love procs. When I pop Bloodlust, I'm almost guaranteed to get my mace to proc, which almost guarantees my DST to proc, which almost guarantees double Mongoose. Then I trinket, pop a trinket, haste pot and get a friendly LWer to pop drums of battle, all of which get additional gains from being active at the same time.</div>

<br>
So im at the point where I think perhaps I would change my MH (Dragonstrike) to a 2nd syphon if it ever drops.  But givent he lack of stats on the syphon I thought about Rising tides, how does the difference between top end range (313 vs 365) and the 0.2 slower speed compare.<br>
<br>
The stats on rising tide are obviously very nice and would give me an extra 42 hit and 88 if I was duel wielding them, with the loss of the syphon proc (pretty poor imo) and whatever the difference is between the speeds and top end.<br>

		<div id="post_message_465613">Hey guys,<br>
<br>
I suppose i'm the equivalent of a long time listener, first time caller here<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080115232042im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":)" class="inlineimg"><br>
<br>
I've been keenly reading the discussion of relative weapon speeds for shamans, which has really helped push my DPS up. Now, i've run into a specific issue which confuses me, as I'm bloody awful at maths.<br>
<br>
My guild's got to the point where Khara is a farm-fest, where the people going are only looking for maybe one item from one boss. Thus, the other night, despite a total lack of Fool's bane and Decapitator, I walked away with Malchazeen in my trousers. Exciting. A 91 DPS dagger with a 1.8 speed. You'd think that would be good for a Melee DPS person. But, as I read the forum, apparently not.<br>
<br>
My question is this - if i put Malchazeen in my MH, and my Boggspine knuckles in my OH, will my DPS go up from my current MH - Stormreaver warblades? <br>
<br>
The whole weapon speed thing leaves me deeply confused I must say. As far as i can tell slow = best for OH &amp; MH. But will a fast MH be per se bad? Especially if it's replacing a blue with 15 less DPS? <br>
<br>
Also, i'm on the cusp of getting a Runic Hammer - Would Malchazeen MH/Runic Hammer OH be better than Malchazeen/Boggspine or Stormreaver/Boggspine?<br>
<br>
Btw, thanks in general for all the hard work on the maths guys. You've done a great job of not only doing the calculations, but also making them easily accesible to the layman. You've enabled me to beat the two other shamans in my guild who insisted flametounge, GoA and + hit were all the best for shamans. They can't argue with being lower down the DPS charts time and again. <br>
<br>
Basically, you're great<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080115232042im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":)" class="inlineimg"><br>

i assume what you mean is the phrase in the first post; "As noted above, damage from WF and SS are not normalized to weapon speed. Slow/Slow will always outperform any combination of Fast/Slow, Slow/Fast, or Fast/Fast when both weapons are imbued with WF."<br>
<br>
Presumably, "always" means "always" but it's so incredibly counter-intiutive that I thought I would ask the question. If it does mean "always" then is a 2.6 green better than an epic 1.8 as a Main Hand? for that matter, if "always" means "always" is a 2.6 speed grey mainhand I buy from an anvilmar vendor better than an epic dagger? The posts are very clear on OHs - but MH is a little opaque. <br>
<br>
I understand that a slow MH is better for a variety of reasons; Yes, i did read carefully before posting. My question was - in a situation with a 20 DPS difference between a fast weapon and a slow weapon, is it still advantageous to use the slow weapon?<br>
<br>
I know this is true for OH, having read the posts but what about for MH? An advanced search for topics on MH speed on the thread reveals little. I'm only asking because I think it's something that is genuinely confusing.</div>

By using the dagger MH you'd gain 15 Weapon DPS, but you'd lose a lot of instant attack damage from WF and SS.<br>
<br>
You can always do a 5-10 min test on the blasted lands mobs with each combination to check, I'd put my money on the 2.6 still outpacing the malchazeen though.</div>

		<div id="post_message_465718">Is it alright to ask gear questions in this thread? It's possibly the best place to ask since you will all know better than anywhere else, but I think it's just for theorycrafting the mechanics and such?<br>
<br>
Anyway this is my dilemma.. our guild has 6/6 SSC and 3/4 TK down, and all the new gear options I am having open to me are an increase in AP and Crit, but less or no +hit at all. My current stats are as follows: AP:1478, Hit Rating: 155, Crit: 29.56%.<br>
I picked up <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080115232042/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=30060" target="_blank">Boots of Effortless Striking</a>, which gives me an increase of +8 AP, and 0.34% crit, but I completely lose out on 1.08% Hit rating from my <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080115232042/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=28746" target="_blank">Fiend Slayer Boots</a>.<br>
<br>
What's the best to use? There's a few things like this where I gain a small amount of AP and Crit, but lose a lot of hit, basically how much hit can I drop and when does the added AP/Crit outweigh the loss of hit? <br>
<br>
Another example of this would be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080115232042/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=30061" target="_blank">Ancestral Ring of Conquest</a>, replacing my Violet Signet I will gain +8 AP and 0.84% crit, but a loss of 1.00% Hit, I really hope someone can help me out here..thank you.</div>

Basically, if you use a faster weapon, your extra attacks from WF are weaker. With no cooldown, you would get more procs to compensate. However, with a cooldown, you're basically getting a few more procs that are much weaker. The exact dps point a fast weapon would be better is unknown, especially since calculating the effect of the cooldown is...hard.<br>
<br>
The OH thing was mentioned because there are already a lot of choices for the MH, but an uninformed shaman might want to use Malchazeen because it feels like an upgrade when OH drops aren't coming from heroics.</div>

The good news is the old value for DST was a bit on the low side, with 40% uptime(I'd used 1.5 ppm since we didn't have uptime meter) and valuing haste at 2.2(I'd used 2.0 originally) the current version scores a whopping 300 AEP.<br>

The bad news; I just finished testing DST uptime on the PTR(then on live for comparison) and according to my 30min test the proc rate has been lowered <i>substantially</i>. I measured 22.79% uptime over the 30mins. That seemed pretty startling so I repeated the test on the live realms and with identical gear and testing as close to the same as I can manage it scored 41.88%. I 'm sure the sample is small enough for there to be some pretty significant variation, but I'd be surprised if that much of a difference came down to chance.<br>

<br>
If my results are an accurate assessment of the proc rate then the new score using 1.48 for haste(which I think is a bit high) would be about 150 AEP. If the lower proc rate had been noted elsewhere I apologize in advance for not seeing it.<br>

</div>The difference between RT/Syphon, Syphon/RT and Syphon/Syphon is marginal at best, different people achieved different results for the combos.<br>
Technically having the Rising Tide in MH and Syphon in OH is superior over Syphon in MH.<br>
Dual Syphon is fine too. The difference is well below 1% DPS, we're talking ~5 DPS max.</div>

</div>I'm really interested in this as well. We sort of had a huge discussion about this in my guild today, and the end result was that we agreed to disagree.  Passive stats of Wicked Edge of the Planes vs. Haste proc of Dragonstrike, which is better after the patch? And is it a margin that matters hugely? (I mean, is one like 100 DPS better than the other on average, or are they both good bets for specialization?) I'd figure it out myself, but I'm not good enough at the math to do it..</div>

		<div id="post_message_466666">If you guys find time, I need some advice... For the longest time I stayed with a slow mainhand and a fast offhand for two reasons:<br>
1) Fast offhands were all that were available to me (good ones at least)<br>
2) I did not honestly believe the math<br>
<br>
Well my first week of kara I got emerald ripper and was pleasantly delighted. Put mongoose on it and stayed with that for 5 whole weeks. I then realized that my dps was barely scaling with my gear, so I came to these forums saw all the math and theorycrafting and decided to give it a go. So I bought a 2.6 speed LVL 67 63dps mace on the ah for a few gold, and I was absolutely SHOCKED at what happened. I began out damaging people in our guild who are FAR better geared and have much better weapons then me, consitantly (before it was random but I would always be fairly close to the #1). So then I started looking around for better offhands, and I realized that I am basically screwed. Ive become fairly apathetic to really putting a lot of effort into this game, so I realized that arenaing for 10weeks just to get a 97dps offhand, although worth it, may be too much work. I also looked at having runic hammer made, but saw that it was 2.4 speed, and dont really know if itll work well with a 2.6 speed mh.<br>
<br>
Any suggestions? Should I just suck it up and try to scrap a decent arena rating and play 10 matches a week for that long just to get it (my guild wont be progressing to The Eye anytime soon), or should I just farm for a week or two, grab enough cash to have someone make runic hammer?<br>
<br>
Also, thanks to you guys, I am basically 100% guaranteed a raiding spot as long as I show up because of my mad dps. I like humbling our decently geared fury warrior with my 2 not-as-amazing-weapons-as-his <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304234947im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/biggrin.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":D" class="inlineimg"> &lt;3</div>

		<div id="post_message_466723">Just did some quick testing on the PTR and Live for overall DPS for a 10 minute period (basically a boss fight) for the Dragonstrike haste proc.<br>
<br>
DPS on live showed 995.7 dps with a 27.47% uptime.  <br>
DPS on the PTR showed 944.1 dps with a 26.88% uptime.  <br>
<br>
This cant be taken as a perfect example of the nerf, but it shows it. <br>
<br>
- Crit rate was right around 36% for both tests. <br>
- Attack power was the same, no modifiers with the exception of Unleashed Rage.   <br>
- Unleashed Rage, Flurry and Lightning Speed proc rates would effect the outcome.<br>
- No shocks were used.<br>
- Grace of Air was the only totem used.<br>
<br>
Used Recount, Uptime Meter and WF3sec for tracking purposes.  Tried to follow the same "wait for the WF cooldown" rules for Stormstrike that I do during raids, but used it every time it was up.</div>

It has to run on any comp that has Java virtual machine installed.<br>
You can calculate your expected  DPS and find your own local AEP values.<br>
It covers the following mechanics:<br>
1) Normal (white) damage with appropriate 1 roll attack table<br>
2) Windfury with hidden cooldown and 2 roll attack table<br>
3) Flurry<br>
4) Unleashed rage<br>
5) Storm Strike with its own unique 2 roll attack table<br>
Checked random wws logs and found it corresponding.<br>
What it does not simulate:<br>
1) Armor penetration, need someone to point to the list of boss's armor and what usual - armor debuffss are<br>
2) Procs from items - need to know what procs you would like to add first<br>

<br>
At the very least, the stat weight for haste and the AEP value of Dragonspine Trophy on the front page are out of whack now. Mongoose and the haste metagem might need to be re-evaluated too.<br>
<br>
It looks like haste will have the same value as hit now, as 1% haste and 1% hit will have the same item budget value (15.8 rating), and both have the same effect (1% more white damage, 1% more WF procs).<br>
<br>

I ran it on 10000 hours, so hopefully that was long enough.<br>
<br>
Edit: I should mention I was using 2350 AP, 32.46% crit, 12.45% hit, and 2.5% haste.<br>
<br>
AP: 1<br>
Str: 2.2<br>
CR: 2.93<br>
Agi: 2.85<br>
HiR: 2.46<br>
HaR: 2.47 (I assume this is with the pre-patch value for haste rating?)<br>
<br>
How realistic do those seem to you?<br>
<br>
As for procs:<br>
* Mongoose, definitely<br>
* Ashtongue Talisman of Vision (though I suppose you could just add this as a static +AP, though it wouldn't be quite as accurate)<br>
* Dragonspine Trophy (with the new 20 second internal cooldown and reduced haste changes). <br>
* Tsunami Talisman<br>
* Hourglass of the Unraveller<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Do I put buffed or unbuffed stats in? The default value of 2500 seems very high for unbuffed, obviously, but when I calculate AEPs I get unexpectedly high values for crit/hit (on the order of 1 crit = 3 AP). It's even high for buffed given those hit/crit values. Is hit with or without talents?<br>
<br>
Running the sim again with my unbuffed stats (1700AP, 27 crit, 17 hit) I got negative AEPs (values like -1545.04 haste = 1 AP). Something is clearly going wrong.<br>
<br>
I would suggest doing unbuffed and then putting checkboxes for GoA, BoM, BoK, MotW, BS, FoRA, etc.<br>
<br>
Progress bar doesn't seem to work for me.<br>
<br>
Besides the procs Xoya mentioned I'd add 4 piece T4 bonus, 4 piece T5 bonus, 4 piece T6 bonus.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">First of all, I like it a lot.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101231184833im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":)" class="inlineimg">  My AEP values seem really odd, though -- at least, they're quite different from what's in the OP!  I ran it on 10000 hours, so hopefully that was long enough.<br>
<br>
Edit: I should mention I was using 2350 AP, 32.46% crit, 12.45% hit, and 2.5% haste.<br>
<br>
AP: 1<br>
Str: 2.2<br>
CR: 2.93<br>
Agi: 2.85<br>
HiR: 2.46<br>
HaR: 2.47 (I assume this is with the pre-patch value for haste rating?)<br>
<br>
How realistic do those seem to you?<br>
<br>
As for procs:<br>
* Mongoose, definitely<br>
* Ashtongue Talisman of Vision (though I suppose you could just add this as a static +AP, though it wouldn't be quite as accurate)<br>
* Dragonspine Trophy (with the new 20 second internal cooldown and reduced haste changes). <br>
* Tsunami Talisman<br>
* Hourglass of the Unraveller</div>

</div>1) Check what expected DPS it provides you with.  <b>If</b> it is about the same that you can achieve at 100% performance against boss with almost 0 armor and <b>if</b> the % break-up of attacks is similar to yours - use these AEP values safely.  <br>
2) 10,000 is enough for finding AEP values , 1,000 is enough for comparing gear directly via DPS.  I can add dispertion/probability borders if needed.  For example display not 2.46 but 2.46 ± 0.03.<br>
3) It is assumed that BoK is on (affects Str and Agi AEP values)<br>
4) Used new haste ratio 15.76 = 1% Haste<br>

</div>Not directly, but it gives you a DPS value, so you can add some block of AP (e.g. by changing out the gems) and then compare that to the impact of adding some block of Crit/Hit/etc, or directly compare two pieces of gear.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Do I put buffed or unbuffed stats in? The default value of 2500 seems very high for unbuffed, obviously, but when I calculate AEPs I get unexpectedly high values for crit/hit (on the order of 1 crit = 3 AP). It's even high for buffed given those hit/crit values. Is hit with or without talents?<br>
<br>
Running the sim again with my unbuffed stats (1700AP, 27 crit, 17 hit) I got negative AEPs (values like -1545.04 haste = 1 AP). Something is clearly going wrong.<br>
<br>
I would suggest doing unbuffed and then putting checkboxes for GoA, BoM, BoK, MotW, BS, FoRA, etc.<br>
<br>
Progress bar doesn't seem to work for me.<br>

Besides the procs Xoya mentioned I'd add 4 piece T4 bonus, 4 piece T5 bonus, 4 piece T6 bonus.</div>

For AEP calculation you have to increase Hours - look at how unstable the results are and increase Hours untill they do not change.  10,000 should be ok.<br>

</div>Thanks for the report. Let's name it "beta" <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20101231184833im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":)" class="inlineimg"> Do not use it as gospel - it is very possible to contain bugs at the moment, however please use it as your reports will help to correct it.<br>
<br>
Small changelog:<br>
1. Corrected critical bug that used MH speed for SS's hit with OH. Thanks Fluffiez.<br>
2. Corrected funny java rounding that produced number*1.1/1.1 not equal number leading to AP gradually decreasing when UR ends.  This affected AEP dispertion the most - now should produce much more classic AEP weights.<br>

</div>For those who don't want to do the math,<br>
With 0 weapon skill, you'll have a base miss rate of 7% + 2% = 9%. <br>
With 5 weapon skill, you'll have a base miss rate of 5% + 1% = 6%.<br>
(Base miss rates are increased by 19% as penalty for dual-wielding.)<br>
<br>
Thus, 5 weapon skill = 3% hit. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101231184833/http://www.wowwiki.com/Patch_2.0.1_Release_Notes" target="_blank">According to Blizzard</a>, we also gain 0.1% crit per point of weapon skill, so that's 0.5% crit.<br>
So 5 weapon skill = ~47 hit rating and ~11 crit rating.<br>
We also gain some anti-dodge, anti-parry, and anti-block (as opposed to hit, the anti-miss)but under ideal raiding situations the only valuable one of these is anti-dodge since mobs can't parry or block from behind. That seems to be 0.2% anti-dodge which should be equivalent to at least 3 hit rating (possibly more worthwhile since hit rating should only increase white damage while anti-dodge would cancel out dodged WFs and SSes).<br>

6.4 weapon skill is what will push you through magical spot of 10 weapon skill difference with boss mobs. It equals to having 3.14 (Pi!) Hit and 0.64 Crit.  That is if both your weapons are daggers/fists/maces. If not - roughly half of that.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>No. Sorry for the confusion.<br>
<br>
The weapon skill on it is equivalent to over 3% hit if you are using a mace and a fist, a pair of maces, or a pair of fists. If you are using only one of {mace,fist}, multiply that by 2/3 for MH and 1/3 for OH (in other words, if you MH a mace like me, the weapon skill is equivalent to over 2% hit i.e. over 30 hit rating).<br>
<br>
My AEP calculation includes ALL the stats on it, not just the weapon skill.<br>
<br>
Yo! rightly also mentions that daggers are included, this may be relevant when/if the FT buff hits (i.e. wielding a mace MH/axe OH might be inferior to wielding a mace MH/dagger OH).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

You can calculate your expected  DPS and find your own local AEP values.<br>

1) Normal (white) damage with appropriate 1 roll attack table<br>
2) Windfury with hidden cooldown and 2 roll attack table<br>
3) Flurry<br>
4) Unleashed rage<br>
5) Storm Strike with its own unique 2 roll attack table<br>
Checked random wws logs and found it corresponding.<br>
What it does not simulate:<br>
1) Armor penetration, need someone to point to the list of boss's armor and what usual - armor debuffss are<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I liked the sim. I found interesting that at higher level gear, crit gets it's value down. AP is a safe addition all the time. I've socketed all my BT/MH gear with red gems (ignoring +agil bonuses) and then socketed Belt of One-Hundred Deaths with green/blue gems, since I'll keep it for a long time. Altough I could've switched it with a red gem somewhere else, I'll keep the blue/green requirements for metagem there since I doubt I'll change that piece in a long time, whilst socketing +10 STR gems all over other parts.<br>
<br>
Interesting data:<br>
<br>
<br>
I'm in this last situation, just reached 3500 AP raid buffed (altough around 38% crit) and looking forward putting all my gems into STR. I'm hoping to get 45% crit soon when I loot some more agility items and switch some other stuff over, while maintaining 3500 AP due to gems.<br>
<br>
Always choosing best AEP gear + socketing STR gems no matter what seems the way to go. Also looking forward to +damage/heal from AP. Definitely STR rocks the charts.</div>

</div>Well not just that, but DW benefits more from AP than 2h. Since 2h gets it benefit from 1.0 times AP, which Duel Weild gains benefit from 1.5 times AP (since ap affects both MH and OH -- this is if you have capped +hit however). With 0% hit, 2h effectively gains (1.0 * 0.95 hit rate) = 0.95 from AP and DW gains (1.5 * 0.74 hit rate) = 1.11 from AP. As you can see, the more +hit we have (until we reach cap) the greater the difference between the two is. At a certain point (easily reached when raid buffed), this difference in gain from AP will outweigh the bonus base dps of a 2h weapon over similar ilevel 1h weapons.<br>
<br>
So uh, in other words, as well as improved uptime of UR, you'll also have higher white dmg while DWing.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>This is a pretty gross oversimplification. The amount of AP needed for 1 DPS scales with the amount of +hit you have, and the ratio at which it scales changes based on whether or not your special attacks are hit capped or not.<br>

</div>This is more or less correct. Another major reason is that you must heavily pad your threat when using a 2Her since a single Windfury is a tremendous amount of threat, which cuts in to your total DPS time. Additionally, it is basically impossible to escape some amount of +hit that inevitably goes to waste when you are using a two-handed weapon, and there is no talent that offsets the extra 6% hit from dual wielding [i.e. you can't spend points elsewhere if you wanted to use a two hander, there are just no other useful points to spend at that point in the tree]. The talents that a Shaman gets are good enough for dual wielding that DW (up to 9% hit) is automatically more sustained DPS than using a 2H weapon (up to 3% hit). The ratio described above is .94:1.245 with a 0/42/19 build, and dual wielding also allows all special attacks to be hit-capped through talents alone.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

The idea of offhand procs "stealing" mainhand procs came from the Blizzard forums, and I think all the threads about it have been pruned by now. I don't recall any serious evaluation on this forum.<br>
<br>
"OH eating MH problem" brought up here, and discussed sporadically over the next 2 pages (earliest post I could find on this forum that mentioned OH swings stealing MH procs): <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080413055015/http://elitistjerks.com/f31/t10126-change_windfury_you_does_not_apply_warriors/p9/" target="_blank">The Change to Windfury and You! (does not apply to warriors)</a><br>
<br>
<br>
I posted test results related to this problem on page 11 of that thread. The conclusions I drew from the test at the time were flawed for a number of reasons, but the data is useful at least. I don't think anyone else has posted test data on this problem.<br>
<br>
Don't want to quote the entire thing here, but it's on page 11 of the thread. I was using Black Planar Edge/Malchazeen and logging my number of mainhand vs offhand procs to see how it comapared to my mainhand vs offhand white swings.<br>
<br>
White swings: 40% mainhand / 60% offhand<br>
WF procs: 43.36% mainhand / 56.64% offhand<br>
<br>
<br>
As far as I can tell, a fast offhand interferes with your total windfury damage by keeping you on 3-second cooldown a greater portion of the time. It does not interfere with mainhand windfury specifically (i.e. it interferes with MH and OH windfury equally). Several times people have referred to the offhand "eating" or "stealing" mainhand procs but I've never seen any data supporting that and I'm not even sure what it's supposed to mean.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>The theoretical explaination is that when you have double Windfury enchants, both enchants have a chance to proc on each swing.  This gives a (.8 * .8) 64% of no proc, or a 36% chance of proccing per swing.  This also explains why quad procs happened with staggered ranks, as there would be a 4% chance of both windfuries proccing on the same swing.<br>
<br>
One thing I've never seen mentioned or tested is if WF buffing both weapons applies even if the other weapon has an enchant other than windfury.  It seems unlikely, but is theoretically possible.<br>

		<div id="post_message_485776"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I tend to agree that having secondary points in resto will still be the best (especially for totem twisting.) That said I guess it is a good thing that we are atleast talking about elemental. Though I still think any talk of Elemental devastation is absurd. <br>
<br>
One thing I think that is being missed though is the following. Everyone is thinking purely offensively because currently that is all an enhancement shaman is. If the proposed changes go in, we will all be sitting at 700-1000 dam/healing and a quick swap to a healing weapon and healing shield will put that in the 1200+ healing range. Still not a raid healer by any means but miles ahead of where we were. The largest benefit will easily be to our healing and then searing totem and healing stream totem.<br>
<br>
The boost to shocks will be nice but realistically our + damage is still getting butchered by the damage coefficient and cooldowns on shocks. <br>
<br>
It is going to be pretty exciting. I have access to a rogue and already consider my shaman the best mob grinding class in the game. Give me big healing stream, and big healing waves and 30% damage reduction... <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081109230202im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":)" class="inlineimg"><!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Yes the formula is for incoming damage, so you need to calculate the armor as being a level 73 boss and you're fighting level 70 enemies.<br>
<br>
Your armor is more effective against lower level enemies obviously.<br>
<br>
Example:<br>
<br>
Your tank has 20k armor, he's fighting a lvl 67 mob, the reduction is 68.6%.<br>
Your tank has 20k armor, he's fighting a lvl 70 mob, the reduction is 65.5%<br>
Your tank has 20k armor, he's fighting a lvl 73 mob, the reduction is 62.6%<br>
<br>
Currently you're calculating the reduction as if the boss is getting hit by same-level enemies (aka lvl 73 enh shaman), that is obviously wrong.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I find living without healing focus very difficult. Elemental or Enhance, it's the real dealbreaker for me. Another thing to consider about resto vs elemental, is that Nature's guidance is actually 6 points of hit: 3% melee and 3% spell.

I will try an Ele minor once 2.3 goes through though. The added shock damage is nice, but I'm especially curious about how the extra spell damage will play with Improved Fire Totems (does anyone know if this affects Greater Fire Elemental?). 10% less elemental damage will be great for both raids and pvp.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
How does Haste Rating Stack with Flurry stack with Bloodlust stack with Mongoose?<br>
<br>
With Flurry alone My attack speed with Dragonmaw is 2.08.<br>
<br>
Maybe it's the wording of the tooltip that's confusing me, but in my world, increasing the attack speed by 30% would mean an attack speed of <br>
<br>
2.70*0.7 = 1.89.<br>
<br>
2.08/2.70 = ~.77<br>
<br>
which brings me to the question, does the Haste from flurry diminish like the haste from haste rating as your progress from 60 to 70? Does the same degradation affect Bloodlust?<br>
<br>
With Flurry and Bloodlust, my attack speed drops to 1.60.<br>
<br>
2.08*.07 = ~1.46<br>
<br>
1.6/2.08 = ~.77<br>
<br>
throwing Abacus of Violent Odds in the mix,<br>
<br>
260 Haste Rating(pre 2.2) = 24.73% haste.<br>
<br>
That alone brings me down to 2.18 attack speed<br>
<br>
2.70*0.7527 = 2.03<br>
<br>
All together, I get down to 1.28 attack speed.<br>
<br>
1.60*0.7527 = 1.2<br>
<br>
So my question is: how do these effects apply, and in what order?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
First time poster, long time reader (as much as possible anyway!).<br>
<br>
I am currently applying for a pretty serious raiding guild on Executus and have found that my inappropriate "upgrades" have ended up hurting my overall DPS for end game raids.  The main issue I have always had is judging which stats actually translate into the highest overall DPS gains.  Anyway, whoever broke down the AEP values, thank you so much, it has helped me tremendously and with the addition of the Pawn mod, it's easy mode now on choosing upgrades.<br>
<br>
However, on the subject of Pawn strings, I think I may found an error with the first post, which states:<br>
<br>
Sample Pawn string to use (uses Pater and Tornhoof's AEP values):<br>
<br>
( Pawn: v1: "AEP (Pater/Tornhoof)": RedSocket=17.6, CritRating=2, Strength=2.2, MetaSocket=24, Agility=2, HitRating=1.4, HasteRating=1.48, BlueSocket=17.6, YellowSocket=17.6, Ap=1 ) <br>
<br>
Technically - shouldn't the socket values be as follows?<br>
<br>
RedSocket = 17.6 (same) 8 x 2.2 - 17.6<br>
BlueSocket = 8.8 (+4 str - +6 stam gem) 4 x 2.2 = 8.8<br>
YellowSocket = 16.8 (+4 str - +4 crit gem) 4 x 2.2 + 4 x 2 = 16.8<br>
<br>
Maybe I am missing something; some additional clarity would be welcomed.  Thank you.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
Strictly speaking, the AEP of stamina is 0, because it does not contribute directly to DPS.  If you can guarantee you'll never get hit, you don't need any extra health -- and if you're going to get one shot anyway, it doesn't matter what your health was before it happened.  Many fights definitely have a minimum value due to AoE or cleave effects, which change depending on your raid makeup.  If you group with two warriors, for example, you can effectively shave 100 +STM off your gear thanks to commanding shout.<br>
<br>
Stamina shouldn't be in the AEP numbers, but enhancers should pick up stamina gear whenever possible.  That way we can stack just enough of it to form a baseline contoured to the fight and the group, and have the rest of our gear devoted to that which maximizes our DPS.<br>
<br>
I currently maintain two sets of DPS gear: one with a health goal of 6500 (which is a nice buffer for those bosses that have 3000 damage AoE pulses), and my high DPS set with no lower limit (and thus around 5500 health).  As I push into higher tiers of raiding, I expect to push up my "survival" set's baseline to match the tougher raid bosses.<br>
<br>
I think all of this applies to int as well.  I currently have no problems with mana, but I will if I keep trading hunter/shaman/druid gear for rogue leathers.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
first of all a big THANK YOU to all of you guys. I've learned so much about my char by goings through this whole post.<br>
<br>
But at the moment I've still one question. A few days ago, I had a discussion with my raidleader about the setup of the melee group. We had 2 rogues, 1 offwarrior and me. <br>
<br>
 The question: Is it better to take a BM hunter (3% more damage) or a feral druid to optimize the DPS output of this group. <br>
<br>
Are there any calculations? Especially in connection with all my melee buff? <br>
or is it a really stupid question and the answer is very easy?<br>

I didn't think much of it, but I've always socketed my gear for a LOT of crit. I checked just now and I have 32% crit unbuffed, but only 1452 AP. I started looking into my personal performance a little and I remain unsatisfied for now, really. Would my performance improve by regemming anything of my gear?

Well +8 crit is 16 AEP and 8 Str is 17.6 AEP (with BOK).  So from a pure min max perspective +8 Str is just better.  I have always viewed 30% crit as a good breakpoint, but honestly I just go with whatever is the highest AEP return.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
Even while doing a full burn rotation (SS-&gt;WF-&gt;GoA-&gt;Shock), you'll have periods of time where you have nothing to do in your GCDs anyway, plently of time for you to refresh other totems. As for shocks, you can use Earth Shock if the Flame Shock debuff is still up. None of these reasons are good enough for sticking to an artifical lower DPS cycle, unless you're having problems with concentration or focus.</div>

I don't have macros set up for them simply because I find it is very situational.  It depends on the fight.  If I can spare the mana, I'll lay down GoA a few times for a bit extra DPS, but by no means will I put it in my rotation for DPS.</div>

What do you mean, 'i don't believe in totem twisting' ?<br>

What don't you believe in? that it boosts dps a lot more than just regular totem dropping?<br>
<br>
How can you say a group dps boost is situational? I would say the exact contrary, not using it is very situational, as they are a few fights for which it's not really adapted. But for the grand majority of the raids, having more dps is always good. And there is no better use of your GCD than to twist these totems for the simple and obvious reason that giving this agi to your whole group is immensly superior to doing a few more shocks, or whatever your using your GCD for.</div>

Basically he's using the first 5 second window before the first refresh for other things then twisting. At the 5 seconds the duration is increased for anyone in range to 9 again and dropping GoA there gives him a full twist time of GoA.<br>
<br>
You'd have to time it very good though since if you put it down just slightly to fast by misstake (timers in wow leave quite a bit to wish for) your group would have ~8 seconds without Windfury. At worst with instant twisting your group would have ~1 second without Windfury and that's only if you are to late refreshing totems and that's still a possibility with the above method so it adds to that as well.</div>

</div>I think we all understood that.<br>
<br>
The criticism isn't about losing WF uptime but GoA! Basically with this rotation not only do you miss out on having GoA down and thus more critchance when you SS, but your group lose about 27% uptime on GoA (i assume previous poster calculation is correct, i'm too lazy to check on it but it sounds about right).<br>
As a previous poster says, why bother doing a totem twist if you don't optimize it?</div>

</div>If you look at what I quoted I think it's clear not everyone got it, granted the explanation was mixed up in 2 posts previous to mine but can't hurt to clarify it considering how often things get asked repeatedly in this thread. Also one of them was wrong about rounding, blizzard is rounding everything I've checked up not down.<br>

</div>That's a stupid comment, that's like saying a small improvment is worse then no improvment at all. Perhaps he can't sustain it mana wise, I really don't know his reasons. <br>
<br>
I never suggested he shouldn't twist all out, personally I believe twisting all out would be safer, easier and better.</div>

</div>85/65 = 27%. When you compare two alternate methods, you compare them with each other, not an impossible maximum (100%).<br>
<br>
The problem is you don't justify your combination method of twisting and shocking. If you have mana issues sustaining both, you determine which one gives more damage over a fight and stop doing the other one except when you have excess mana. Attempting to do both half-arsed is silly.<br>
<br>
You have more than enough time to refresh totems and shields no matter what rotation you take, this is a poor excuse for a reason (as I've pointed out). As for decursing, I find it pretty rare that I need to 'decurse' someone that my cleansing totem or a healer hasn't already taken care of. I'd be interested to see a WWS of any fight where you're doing significant amounts of cleansing.<br>
<br>
As for prioritizing talking shit in /p instead of trying to maximise your contribution, that's your choice to do, just don't try to use it as a justification for the rest of us.</div>

And as for dps contribution. The question is: is 20% more total uptime of  goa is better than damage contribution of shocking. I bet answer is yes but only till patch. And only in perfect  oe close to perftect group( we often raid without warrior or with just 1 rogue)</div>

Though I think having the section titles THAT big is a little overbearing... Though it is easier to find any given section on a whim, its a bit harder to read as the titles are so attention grabbing, but then i am just nitpicking <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302181323im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/wink.gif" border="0" alt="" title=";)" class="inlineimg"><br>
<br>
But, on for my question, I am a newb(as the guild name proclaims), but been reading this thread for a week or so now, so much information! I have probably only read maybe a third or so of all the comments... so sorry if this has been covered.<br>
<br>
I know in the OP regarding MH weapons, it says use the crafted mace over the crafted axe (unless your an orc, which I am not) and it seems the reason given is because of the belt which gives +25 weapon skills, but not axes... <br>
<br>
Is the mace still better than the axe without that belt? because once I do get to 70... My guild is still going to be a long way from Vashj <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302181323im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":)" class="inlineimg"><br>
<br>
Even so, I find myself slightly leaning towards the mace since the proc can push the weapon speed out of the "blackhole" between 1.41 and 1.50 which it seems Heroism + Flurry will drop any 2.6-2.8 speed weapon into (unless my calculations are wrong which is entirely possible ;p )</div>

Edit: To answer your question: yes. The difference is so small that it really doesn't matter much. I believe the mace comes out a little over the axe, but the difference is really really small.<br>

The haste proc or static AP and CR, haste probably scales the best between the two... Or is the difference really so minimal it just becomes an aesthetic choice?<br>
<br>
**<br>
Hmm, yeah, using Yo's just default stats and changing between +48 ap 1% crit or the haste proc, seems to estimate the haste being better by 17dps... Being a sim obviously that can fluctuate by actual experienced procs during a given fight... So I guess it really doesn't make much difference, but the mace would probably pull ahead very slightly more often than fall behind...</div>

</div>I'm a little confused by what everyone means by 'screwing up'. Unless you drop GoA early, worst case senario is that you don't get the full 9-10s of GoA + WF. I did my totem twisting this way when I had mana problems (read: Paladins weren't doing their jobs) but it's a pain in the ass when learning new encounters. Double clicking then having 8 seconds to deal with the encounter  is much easier. On the other hand, having 10 full seconds of GoA usually means more WF crits.<br>
<br>
Great work with the contents Malan, but I doubt it will keep the people who weren't reading the OP from asking those silly questions.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I'm a little confused by what everyone means by 'screwing up'. Unless you drop GoA early, worst case senario is that you don't get the full 9-10s of GoA + WF. I did my totem twisting this way when I had mana problems (read: Paladins weren't doing their jobs) but it's a pain in the ass when learning new encounters. Double clicking then having 8 seconds to deal with the encounter  is much easier. On the other hand, having 10 full seconds of GoA usually means more WF crits.<br>
<br>
Great work with the contents Malan, but I doubt it will keep the people who weren't reading the OP from asking those silly questions.</div>

</div>Screwing up of me would be quite hard. I got a bar in my UI that shows duration of WF buff. I drop goa when it refreshes then drop wf when i reaches 0. After some practice its now second nature and i dont even think about it.</div>

		<div id="post_message_506289">@Yo, did you change your sim model recently, DPS output dropped  a fair amount since I last compared values.<br>
<br>
Example:<br>
2500 AP (without UR), 40% Crit, 20% Hit, 0% Haste, 4400 Armor, two 100 DPS weapons<br>
<br>
Disable all buffs, including Mongoose etc.<br>
<br>
Your sim outputs: 492 DPS WhiteDPS, 100% UR, 88% Flurry<br>
Armor Reduction: 29%  for 4400 Armor<br>
<br>
Let's do some math:<br>
White DPS for two identical weapons factor: 1.5 (offhand dps is 0.5)<br>
I assume 5% Dodge for now and 28% miss<br>
Adjusted Attacktable factor (100-28+20-5+40)/100 = 1.27<br>
Adjusted flurried Weaponspeed = 2.072 (12*2.6 + 88*2.0)/100<br>
Flurry Factor = 1.254 (2.6/2.072)<br>
Weaponmastery: 1.1<br>
Now DPS calc should be: 0.71*1.5*1.27*1.254*1.1*(2500*1.1/14+100) = 553 DPS<br>
<br>
This is some 60 DPS more and the gap increases with more/better stats.<br>
<br>
This is just for WhiteDPS, similar method can be applied to windfury (same calculation to some degree).<br>
<br>
If we enable only Dual Wielding, disable every other Talent and remove the Armor completely (0 Armor) your result is 510:<br>
The formula for that would be 1.5*1.27*(2500/14+100) = 530<br>
You probably assume a higher dodge rate somewhere, if you assume 9% (which can be explained by applying a similar partial weaponskill dependent function on dodge) I get your values, if you do not assume 9% dodge, then you maybe missed something.<br>
<br>
If we assume 28% hit, 0 AP, 0 Crit etc. and the two 100 DPS weapons, your result is 128<br>
now hit and crit are out of the equation, your assume dodge value is close to 15%.<br>
I don't know what other criteria you consider while swinging but something is obviously lowering the dps more than it should. Do you assume parry from behind or any other further reduction from within the attacktable?</div>

Did you see a DPS increase switching from Dragonstrike to Syphon in the MH?

Since Yo's DPS Simulator doesn't have a feature to input the Bloodlust Brooch, would it be accurate to substitute for it by adding 278x20/120 AP to the base AP listed? Mathmatically it makes sense, but I don't know if it'd actually really apply that way.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">For flurry reasons, in a perfect situation, same speed is always going to be better if you can get your weapons attacking at the same time because the game has to fudge the numbers a bit to compensate for lag.  However, using two same speed weapons can seriously nerf your windfury damage if you're always attacking with your offhanding first, which you will be doing if you begin attacking outside of melee range of the mob.  That's most likely why, in practice, slow/slower works out better for damage than same speed weapons.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">This is a fallacy -- the same thing has an equal chance of happening with MH procs. Using the same speed weapons is simply more subject to streakiness due to this factor; different speeds will eventually force the cycle to be broken and can result in more consistent damage. In truth it matters little because Stormstrike always considers the MH to hit first and thus get first chance to proc. You'll rarely see the same hand proc more than a few times in a row, and it ends up being more of a coin toss chance as to which hand will go off next with the odds slightly skewed in the main hand's favor.</div>

	</table>
</div>I'm having trouble figuring out exactly what Nite_Moogle means here.  I assume he's referring to the quote that "same speed weapons can seriously nerf your dps", and not debating the actual mechanic of it.  I am under the impression that:<br>
1) Starting an attack before in melee range will give a random hand priority to get windfury, as opposed to MH priority always when starting swings while in range.<br>
2) This can only be corrected by stopping the attack and starting again.<br>
3) Leaving melee range while attacking will create the same problem again.<br>
<br>
Has this been debunked?  I apologize if I missed it.  If it hasn't I had a question, is a simple macro such as the following sufficient to correct the problem and give MH priority again?<br>
<br>
<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px">

/startattack</pre>
</div>It would make sense to me that you'd have to wait for the swing timers to reset before attacking again.  Though technically I thought the weapons were already hitting at the same time anyway, just with a screwy proc mechanic, so maybe not.  Since I'm currently dual-wielding 2.6, I'm pretty concerned about it.<br>
<br>
I was also wondering if anyone knows of a good substitute for something like lootzor.com.  At the moment, lootzor messes up gemming by adding a fake +8 agi blue slot gem, in addition to STILL not having haste rating.  Pawn is nice, but requires researching alot of items manually.  If nothing has been made I might consider writing a plugin for atlasloot or something that has similar functionality to lootzor.<br>
<br>
Also FIRST POST!</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Mullet: the issue is that your actual PPM doesn't drop very much when you have a full load of hit vs almost no +hit. The proc rate on Windfury is high enough that you can afford to miss ~15-18% of the time (as you do with a 9% hit from talents and a usual gear loadout) and, thanks to the 3 second cooldown, your PPM will not drop significantly from a value that is closer to 5%. Essentially, by the time you've capped your yellow attack hit rate, you've provided enough +hit that Windfury will never spend more than a couple of seconds on cooldown.</div>

	</table>
</div>Perfect. That's what I want to hear.<br>
<br>
Reading through the OP it doesn't really mention what an optimal hit rating is. I know the higher my AP and Crit the better. <br>
<br>
From what I am reading here you are suggesting +130 may be a bit of an overkill if dropping to around 90-100 would allow me to stack that much more AP and Crit.<br>
<br>
BTW, great guide. I have followed it to a T and it has pushed me to the top3 in a TK/SSC progressing guild.</div>

</div>I personally feel the odds of which hand is proccing WF are pretty good anyway and are already slanted in favor of the main hand because of SS that this tidbit of information, while accurate, is not going to probably change your damage output all that much in a fight over a few seconds long.  Though I would love to see some math that proves that once again enhancement mechanics make no sense and prove my instinct wrong.</div>

</div>This will always cause your main hand to swing as long as you are only hitting it every 3 seconds or so. When you initiate autoattack, your offhand weapon has a warmup time of half its normal delay before it is eligible to swing. Stormstrike doesn't have this limitation, both weapons will hit immediately unless the main hand attack doesn't connect, in which case the offhand isn't eligible to hit. What I was referring to in the post you quoted was that Xoya was overlooking that in a normal situation where your attacks aren't synchronized, WF procs are typically cyclical between main hand and offhand and using non-same-speed weapons forces this cycle to be broken.<br>

</div>There isn't one, mostly because you can eliminate yellow attack misses through talents alone (9%) which Warriors and Rogues cannot do, which is why they often have a "minimum" hit rating. You don't need any more than what you'll find on the rest of your "best" items. Only at the very top end of itemization have people hypothesized via simulator that hit becomes more valuable than further stacking AP or crit.<br>
<br>
Sonlox: Use WWS and add up their main hand white damage and multiply it by .2 -- that's your easily quantified contribution that WF would offer. There isn't a terribly easy way to do it, but it can be done, and you should definitely be using WF in that group.</div>

<br>
As people will point out, however - 20% more main hand white damage &gt; 2.5% crit + an extra poison for rogues.  Warriors, however, can get turned upside down if they are playing in a way where they are constantly using slam (thus not proc'ing windfury).<br>
<br>
Quick math on that 20% point.  If, for a rogue, 50% (low estimate) of dps comes from white damage, and 60% of that 50% is from the main hand (low estimate again), thats:<br>
<br>
100% * 50% * 60% = 30% of all damage comes from Main hand white damage.<br>
<br>
Increase this by 20% = 6% dps boost from windfury.<br>
<br>
I have no idea how a rogue would get a 6% dps boost from 2.5% crit and an extra poison, but maybe I'm missing something.</div>

</div>No way is GoA better than WF for the fury warrior. If he's asking for GoA, just give up because your raidmates are idiots.<br>
<br>
GoA is obviously better than WF for the druid. No surprise there that he wants it, but he's being selfish.<br>
<br>
If your rogues aren't specced for PvE -- say, they are Envenom or something -- then they might want GoA so they can keep both poisons on. I know that prior to the most recent WF nerf, WF was still better than GoA+poisons for even Envenom rogues. But I'm not sure that this is obviously the case even after the most recent WF nerf.<br>
<br>
If your rogues are specced for PvE, tell them to put Deadly on their OH and leave their MH poison free. WF is definitely better under such a situation. However, if your rogues are such mouth-breathers that they can't figure this out, at some point you have to give up and accept that it doesn't matter what totem you drop for them since they will suck either way.</div>

</div>Unless their offhand is spectacularly better than their mainhand, at least 2/3 of their white damage will be from the mainhand because the offhand does half as much damage.  So, divide the white damage dps by .66 and then multiply that by .2 -- that's the benefit gained from Windfury.<br>
<br>
Cross this with the benefit added from additional AP/crit across the entire group and the loss of the rogues' mainhand poisons and the warrior's sharpening/lodestones and WF usually still comes out on top, even though the druid (and shaman) gain no benefit from it at all.<br>
<br>
It might close, though...I've been in a similar group, and wound up dropping GoA because myself and the druid were the best geared by a wide margin.  And if the druid's main tanking, you drop GoA to give him a boost of threat.</div>

I know Shocks and fire totems are not ALOT of our damage, but they are still a fair bit.<br>
<br>
Thanks in advance.</div>

		<div id="post_message_524506">Greetings, fellow enhance shaman.<br>
<br>
I've been lurking on this thread for several months and have used it to greatly refine my playstyle over that period of time, particularly with regards to making intelligent gearing and talent choices in order to maximize my dps. I was testing out specs on the PTR in an attempt to figure out what would be an "optimal" spec in order to put out the maximum possible dps post-2.3, and what I came up with was the following 2/45/14 build:<br>
<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302195250/http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=hMZxV0diMsAuqox0ez" target="_blank">Talent Calculator - World of Warcraft</a> (Assume that two handed weapons is really shamanistic focus and that we are dealing with the 2.3 version of MQ.)<br>
<br>
I understand that the current cookie-cutter spec is 0/42/19, and I agree with the current theorycrafting that even post 2.3 with our improved shock damage, it is not worth losing Nature's Guidance in resto to go down to Elemental Devastation in the elemental tree.<br>
<br>
In a raid situation, however, past 3/3 Nature's Guidance and perhaps 1 point in Totemic Mastery, there is absolutely nothing in resto that improves our DPS. Given that in a raid situation, I can count on one hand the number of times I've cast a heal while getting hit by some incidental damage, wouldn't it make sense to drop the excess points in healing focus to get 2/5 concussion? I am well aware that shocks tend to be around 7% of my current damage, but isn't improving 7% of my damage by 2% better than impoving 0% of my damage by 0% and providing virtually no extra raid utility?<br>
<br>
The only time I could see value in healing focus is soloing elites (trees in skettis?) or in PVP; in a raid situation, healing focus is just wasted points.<br>
<br>
Comments and observations welcome.</div>

<br>
But to be quite specific in responding to your statement, FoRA won't be any more AEP in 2.3 -- since we shamans use AEP to stand for Attack Power Equivalence Points, and FoRA grants 120 AP, it will <b>always</b> be equal to 120 AEP for any gear or talent combinations. The only malleable AEP values are that of hit/crit/haste/armor penetration, and since AP is now worth more, each of these is worth comparatively less, and will receive a lower AEP value.</div>

<br>
I've recently gotten my hands on the Blessings Deck and am looking for more info on its performance in a raid setting as opposed to Hourglass of the Unraveller.  <br>
<br>
The deck itself will prob fetch 1500g+ and we have Gruul on farm for a chance at the best enhancement trinket in game so I'm debating using it.<br>
<br>
I guess my main question would be if I could fairly easily have both the 120ap and 80 spell damage fully stacked for extended boss fights.  I'm interested to see the synergy between this trinket and the new AP to Spell damage buff in addition.<br>
<br>
I'm aware that:  <br>
<br>
<b># [Darkmoon Card: Crusade] 120 AEP<br>
At a full stack, since this will take 10-15 sec to achieve, the AEP might be considered less valuable.</b><br>
# [Bloodlust Brooch] 118.3 AEP = ( 72 + ( 278 * 20 / 120 ))<br>
# [Hourglass of the Unraveller] 109 AEP = (( 32 * CritRating ) + ( 300 * 10 * 0.9 / 60 ))<br>
Assuming a 0.9 PPM<br>
<br>
Edit: Armory shows pvp gear, I'm using Brooch/Unraveller currently.</div>

</div>Sorry, I misunderstood what he was asking. I thought he was asking about the usefulness in raids as opposed to the hourglass. I guess my main point should have been that there aren't many fights where this card is useful, and in my experience it's not worth the cost. I tried using it in raids for a while (Gruul, Mag and early SSC) and decided that Broach/Hourglass was a better combo.<br>
<br>
30% of our AP means the card gives 40 spell damage when it's fully stacked. So in the rare instance that you could get it stacked to full with both buffs, the card would give 120 ap and 120 sdmg. Due to the stacking mechanic, I still don't think this is ideal for raid encounters at SSC level or higher.</div>

</div>Drats answered his question.  Resist rates and the lack of spell hit create a situation that will more often than not prevent the spell damage component from reaching a full stack or keeping it up, as one resisted shock will lose the spell damage stack entirely.  As such, there will be little to no synergy, not to mention the lackluster spell coefficient really won't add all that much damage from this trinket.<br>
<br>
(120*0.3 + 80)*0.43*0.86 = 42.9 damage added to each shock, roughly 7.15 DPS<br>
<br>
And that's best case scenario, where you get lucky and don't have a shock resisted.  It's really not a great enh shaman trinket, IMO.  I agree with Drats.  Sell the deck.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">2 questions:<br>
<br>
1. Is there some maths for orc changes in 2.3. Especially if its still the best choice to use RT in MH?<br>
<br>
2. How does the proc of the syphon work. I think there is no maths on this(??), but just basically?? Is it just more dps or what? I'm not yet in hyjal/bt so i can't imagine how the proc works</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</div> Searching this thread will give you the answer to 1. (heck you could just check back in 2 or 3 days and you'll see it asked again, plus you'll learn the secret to the exact amount of +hit an enhancement Orc absolutely needs in order to raid)<br>
<br>
Question 2: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302195250/http://wowhead.com/?item=32262#comments" target="_blank">Syphon of the Nathrezim - Items - World of Warcraft</a><br>
Wowhead.com is not this forum, so I can understand how, when you searched this thread for your answers, but you didn't find that link.<br>
However, you mention there is no maths, more dps, or what, i can't imagine. . . which means you did not search "syphon proc" in this forum at all.<br>
<br>
Please feel free to search this thread, first and then not ask questions that are already answered.<br>
<br>
In order to facilitate searching in the future:<br>
Answer 1: ORC 2.3 patch using RT (rising tide) in your main hand is NOT your best choice to use in your mainhand. It depends on what other weapons you have available. If you only have a Wicked Edge of the Planes and RT, then WEP in MH, RT in OH. If you have RT + Syphon, then MH the RT, OH the Syphon. If you have RT + S3axe, then MH the RT, OH the S3.<br>
<br>
Answer 2: Syphon can place a buff on you. This buff allows all of your melee attacks to steal life from your enemy. Stealing life is shadow based. Stealing life damages your enemy and heals you when it works. Debuffs on your target can increase the shadow damage done, it's normally 20damage, but i've seen 30 while raiding, which increases the healing received. Immunity to shadow damage (or random immunities to weapon based spell damage) stop this effect completely. So you won't leech any life from Void Reaver. I've noticed that sometimes Teron Gorefiend goes immune to the effect, but normally I do leech life from him. The proc activates more than once per minute for me, but not quite twice per minute. I get 10 to 12 hits while a proc is active. Therefore i get 10 to 24 *30ish damage per minute. Each syphon I wield provides approximately 5 to 12dps in shadow damage.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Will the AEP values of the stats in the original post be readjusted? or is it not that big of a change to worry about?<br>
<br>
Sry for the trouble.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</div>If there's a significant difference from how things are now, then yes, the AEP values will be adjusted to compensate.<br>
<br>
In terms of DPS, 1 AP will grant 0.3 spell damage. Earth Shock has a 3/7 coefficient and Flame Shock has a 15% coefficient on the instant damage and 52% coefficient on the DoT. So the Mental Quickness buff will make 1 AP will give you an additional 0.12857 + 0.045 + 0.156 damage every 12 seconds using a perfect shock rotation. This does not account for spell resists, crits, or debuffs such as Misery -- we will assume that with the lack of spell hit and crit on our gear these factors work out to be a wash. This adds up to 0.32957 damage/12 sec = 0.0275 DPS.<br>
<br>
Depending on gear level, this may be consequential or inconsequential in the valuation of other stats with respect to AP -- remember that AP's value scales with hit, crit, haste, and armor penetration. As a rough estimate, at my gear level, 4 AP ~= 1 DPS. So 1 AP = 0.25 DPS. Since we are getting an extra 0.0275 DPS from AP in 2.3, this is about a 10% buff to AP, and we'd thus expect the AEP values of other stats besides STR to decrease by 10%.</div>

</div>Malan, I've been running the mod Uptime Meter and the Executioner enchant stays up around 36% of the time, over 4-5 hours of testing each night for the past week.  Keep in mind that there are also times that I am not DPSing for whatever reason, so the actual % does indeed seem to be closer to 40%, certainly well above 25%.  If you would like i can provide a in game SS.<br>
<br>
Perhaps someone should test this on the Blasted Lands mobs.  Proc rates dont increase on lower level mobs, and getting 2-3 hours of solid testing will answer way more questions...</div>

</div>My guess is that Executioner and Mongoose, in a vacuum comparison one vs one, are roughly equal for us. We know that Armor Pen is more valuable the more of it you have - which is precisely why I said about a page ago that it looks like Executioner would mainly benefit T6 shaman. Perhaps you should take the Mongoose/Mongoose and Executioner/Mongoose setups and see what happens as you slowly increase the amount of Armor Penetration (while holding everything else steady). The closer to zero armor the mob approaches the Executioner setup (with a 250 - 300 Armor Pen lead at the start) should perform better.</div>

I was thinking about taking the 8.48/2.6*the current weapon speed to compare against the 2.6 weapon?  Or am I totally messed in my mathimatically thinking.  Which i probably am, i just haven't seen a post where you can compare DPS of a slower weapon to faster, except to say a slower weapon with same DPS is better.  I'm concerned with the DPS being different and the speed being different.</div>

</div>Like a shaman tachometer? I've tried to set up powerauras to do something like that, but I'm far too inept to get it to work. The problem is setting up powerauras to display things as you gain them in a visually logical manner, when it just wants to slap them up. I tried setting up a logical hierarchy of buffs, in most common to least common order, giving them all the same graphic, just in a slightly different size and location, like a pyramid beside my character. <br>
<br>
The problem with this was that it was as ugly as a sackful of assholes, and wasn't at all helpful. I was better off looking over at ElkBuffBars, seeing what was up, or just checking the length of the list in my peripheral vision.<br>
<br>
Very interested to see what you come up with if you decide to embark on coding it. I'll beta test if you need help with that. I'm too stupid to do anything helpful in this thread, the least I can do is help with an addon I think most of us would like to see. Bonus points for ripping the graphic off from some manner of expensive sports car tachometer.</div>

As far as I know all fire totems check the spell damage bonus of the shaman every time they do a damage so it's not recommended to put down searing totem when you have the most ap. Healing stream totem (like earth shield and every other hot spells) works like you said.</div>

</div>I'm not particularly concerned with mana conservation. I've found it somewhat impossible to run out of mana since the advent of 2.3. I had a throwaway point, and there it went. Earth's Grasp is a new one for me, as well. I PvP a lot, and I wanted to test its effectiveness. So far, it's been much more useful between frost shocks for slowing an escaping opponent.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">So I am totally posting this out of pure lazy in the hopes that someone will make it into a mod before I get bored and decide to.<br>
<br>
A bar which displayed AP and spell power would be very useful, since hitting a spike (all your trinkets, full darkmoon stack, whatever). I see it like one of those peak audio displays, where the top of the bar would be the highest value reached in this combat, the bar would display the current value. Spell damage would be an overlay on top of of the AP, in a different color, but otherwise the same. This would be a useful thing so you can see, "Oh I just hit an AP peak, I should re-drop searing/nova/magma totem." <br>
<br>
Just a quick thought I had during Gruul tonight.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</div>Get the addon "Meleebuffs" from the wowace site. It displays your melee stats from your character sheet on a specific window.<br>
<br>
But just as an aside, at least searing totem uses you current spell damage for each tick, not the spell damage when you cast it, so you dont have to worry about dropping it in AP peaks. Healing stream, on the other hand, does use the +heal you had you when you dropped it to calculate each tick for its duration.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Like a shaman tachometer? I've tried to set up powerauras to do something like that, but I'm far too inept to get it to work. The problem is setting up powerauras to display things as you gain them in a visually logical manner, when it just wants to slap them up. I tried setting up a logical hierarchy of buffs, in most common to least common order, giving them all the same graphic, just in a slightly different size and location, like a pyramid beside my character. <br>
<br>
The problem with this was that it was as ugly as a sackful of assholes, and wasn't at all helpful. I was better off looking over at ElkBuffBars, seeing what was up, or just checking the length of the list in my peripheral vision.<br>
<br>
Very interested to see what you come up with if you decide to embark on coding it. I'll beta test if you need help with that. I'm too stupid to do anything helpful in this thread, the least I can do is help with an addon I think most of us would like to see. Bonus points for ripping the graphic off from some manner of expensive sports car tachometer.</div>

</div>I'd really be interested in beta testing something like this as well. Just a couple nights ago I was thinking it would be cool to have an addon that would tell you what your highest AP spikes were and such just like I think you're talking about.<br>

Granted, I have 19.87% to hit without the Resto 3%, so the change isn't quite as jarring.

				<div style="font-style:italic">I'd enchant it with 70AP. Mongoose is pretty expensive and works best on two weapons. That being said: <b>Do not use a two hander for enhancement pve</b>. All of our talents and buffs are designed around DW. UR and flurry uptime take a huge hit with a 2hander, and that decreases damage for your whole group. <br>
<br>
Gearwise, there's a lot you can do to upgrade. If you have the time and money, I'd suggest farming up a fel edged battle axe for MH and the Heroic Underbog offhand. I'd also suggest hitting up heroics for key upgrades like the WF totem(Mana Tombs) and bloodlust broach(badges). If you have atlas and statbuster, take some time to look through instances and find which pieces of gear are easily attainable upgrades. <br>
<br>
PS. Your crit is really really low. At the minimum you'd want it high enough so that UR has a good chance of proccing within 10 seconds.<br>
<br>
Edit: Oh, you might want to hold to the HWL axe for an offhand till you get something better.</div>

</div>Correct me if I'm wrong, but we're more of a melee support/dps class than a straight up dps class. So it seems to me that we can never really challenge for the top spots dps-wise in a raid. If this isn't the case, I'd love to hear how people are achieving those spots over the so-called "pure" dps classes (as I've always thought we couldn't keep up with equally geared mages/hunters/rogues/locks).<br>
<br>
Probably a topic already discussed in another thread, and I don't like hijacking other people's discussions. Forgive me ahead of time. Much love to my Shaman sisters and brethren.</div>

</div>Maybe it's the lack of a well geared rogue, but I tend to be #1 on your average tank and spank boss.<br>
You can easily compete with warriors, hunters, mages and warlocks, last one probably being the hardest.<br>
<br>
Not saying that I always beat them, but it's certainly not a clear cut case of them doing more damage.<br>
<br>
Then again, the only really "pure" dps class is a rogue, as they add nothing to a raid beside their personal damage.</div>

You can do good DPS, but you really shouldn't be top. Your windfuries are capped with a 3 second cooldown timer, but all you're going to do is 'shift' the percentages of your yellow and white damage. With haste rating, you'll see more white damage and less yellow in the total percentage of your overall damage. Haste rating is not evil.</div>

</div>Point for point, haste rating is. However, you usually get armor reduction in batches, and haste rating in tiny offerings. Of note is that Mongoose also doesn't use hast rating, but is a static 2% speed increase.<br>
<br>
How valuable it is will entirely depend on your current gear, so you'll have to do some legwork there. I suspect that for most people, the amount of armor pen available will outstrip the amount of haste rating available because of ZA's increased availability of that stat vs needing access to BT to get haste rating.</div>

</div>Its not without a meta gem (the ones from ZA are the only that I am aware of that could be considered "upgrades" that do not have a meta gem) but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302195319/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=32087" target="_blank">Mask of the Deceiver - Items - World of Warcraft</a> is a definite upgrade. Now whether you'll find that ascetically pleasing (go go recolored Nightslayer!) or be willing to spend 50 Badges is yet to be determined.<br>

I'm glad to see that they fixed those problems so quickly. Unfortunately, haste is now bugged but I reckon they'll get that fixed in short order.</div>

I tried searching armory to look at your gear to run the simulation, but I don't seem to be able to find your character on US or Europe.  I couldn't find an armory link in your profile either.  I would be curious also if you have any WWS charts that include the proc effect of the Syphons in a duel wield setup.</div>

what im curious to know is the break even point between crit and AP. according to yo's simulator, at my current gear level AP/strength is valued higher than my crit (running at ~27%)  until I approach 2k AP unbuffed. I would think that 2k AP unbuffed is quite a high goal to reach, even being in BT.<br>
<br>
cutting to the point, am I truly getting the most DPS at my current gear level keeping 26% crit and 1.3k AP or, going against yo's simulator, would I get more out of 30% AP and 1.1-1.2AP? IE: am I reading/using the numbers right, or not taking into account the value of crit through flurry and UR ? :P</div>

<br>
@ Oscarwilde: Its in the nature of %'s to scale. So the more AP you get the more valuable crit, hit, expertise, armor penetration (reduces enemy damage migitation by a % depending on its current armor) will become.<br>
2k AP unbuffed will be quite high I recon, even in BT gear. However in a raid you can add a huge portion to that from raid buffs, procs, consumables and ofcourse your own str totem <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304081109im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":)" class="inlineimg">.</div>

</div>This is not surprising. AP/Strength has consistently been one of the best uses of item budget for enhancement shamans. Patch 2.3 only improved the value of AP/Strength by making it affect our shocks as well as our melee damage. While the 2.2 version of Yo's sim told me that without BoK, crit rating was superior to strength, the 2.3 version is telling me that strength is superior even without BoK.<br>

</div>Run both numbers through the sim, find out which has higher DPS. Evaluate upgrades using EP numbers the sim gives. As your gear improves, I would expect you to reach about 1600 AP and 30% crit, at which point you'll start seeing crit rating and haste rating being nearly as good as Strength.</div>

</div>Great to see you're back in action. Thanks for this latest update. I'll make a couple functionality requests in order of importance to me:<br>
1) Support expertise/expertise rating, both in DPS calculation and EP calculation. (When you do, I'd enjoy some commentary on how you're calculating EP as well.)<br>
2) Allow people to select the number of talent points in Reverberation, Concussion, and Elemental Devastation.<br>
3) Add Stonebreaker's Totem to the totem selection options. (Yes, we could just manually add 35 AP to our AP, but I'd rather use the interface.)<br>
4) UI clean-up. This is the least exciting task probably. I'd suggest going to something like this:<br>
Tab 1: "Stats &amp; EP Values"<br>
Tab 2: "Enchants &amp; Procs" (move shocks/min to Tab 1 and move Talents to its own tab)<br>
Tab 3: "Talents"<br>
Tab 4: "Buffs &amp; Debuffs" (allow us to set boss debuffs such as CoR, FF, SA on this page... probably move Boss Armor input here too, though I'm not 100% sure what makes the most sense from a design standpoint)<br>
Tab 5: "Import/Export"<br>
Tab 6: "Forensic Report"<br>
<br>
Obviously, any improvements you're able to make are always welcome, and thanks again for your service to the community.<br>

</div>There must be a bug in the UR calculations. Disabling it, only decreases my DPS by a small value. I discovered it a few days ago, before the new version, but it hasn't changed.<br>
<br>
I used following values for the simulation (5000 hrs):<br>
<br>
Stats top to bottom: 1700, 32, 21, 2, 4000, 250, 100.2, 2.8, 0, 100.2, 2.8, 0, 3, 6<br>
Procs: Dual Windfury and Mongoose, DST and Tsunami, no Totem, T6 4pc, no shocks<br>
Buffs: Default with no Potion and active Battleshout<br>
<br>
With UR I get 1331 DPS, without 1324. If I manually add 200 AP it results in 1392 DPS.<br>
<br>
Also it would be nice if the nerfed proc chance of Ashtongue Talisman (50%) could be implemented.</div>

[e] Ok I sent the site author an email and asked him to post here explaining how his system works. Its quite clear that he's not doing a combat simulation but his item rankings are *spot on* with what Yo's sim is giving me.<br>
[e2] If this is really as accurate as it *seems* to be at first glance, this guy has discovered some magical formulas that might actually enable us to just use a spreadsheet instead of a sim.</div>

If you want it academically correct you definitely have to factor in the length of the Fight you are talking about. Once we have that we can calculate how likely it ist that during that time you will have a Streak of Dodge/Misses/Noncrits which must be longer then 10 seconds. This is simply done by multiplying the chance for a noncrit hit * the number of hits you do in 10 seconds. For sake of argument just take 0.7*0.7*0.7 ... <br>

</div>Yes it uses same PPM.  Your result with double Executioner being a drop is expected because Executioner does not stack with itself.  So, when two executioner procs "overlap" that part is wasted opposite to when Executioner and Mongoose are up at same time providing synergetic result (crits and flurried strikes on less armor).</div>

</div>I've thought about this too, but wouldn't it be very easy to disprove?  For example, parse combat logs for instances where there were 6 or more non-crits in a row with a huge dataset and check the next attack for crit rate to see if it is consistant.<br>

</div>It wouldn't take too much effort to keep a queue of the last <i>N</i> attack results and if none of them were the desired result, make the next attack a crit and make the next attack after that your desired result.<br>
<br>
There is one very good reason I believe the PRNGs in WoW might not be 100% random.<br>
Undesirable quest drop streaks. If there are millions of WoW players and hundreds of quests you do from level 1-70 you are going to have a nontrivial number of people who are in that 0.01% of "super unlucky" on quest item drops. If you have a 20% drop rate for some [Bear Ass] then it will take 5 kills on average to get 1 [Bear Ass] but over 1% of the people are going to kill 20 bears before getting your first [Bear Ass]. (1-.2)^20 = .0115 This is not a desirable outcome for Blizzard, because people get confused and think they are in the wrong spot for the quest, or get frustrated and sick of the game.<br>
<br>
Given that Blizzard might be adjusting the drop rates on quest items to prevent "unlucky" streaks, it's not a far leap to wonder if they are adjusting the combat resolution mechanics similarly to prevent an "unlucky" run of misses (which would surely be equally frustrating and occur equally often. If you have a 24% chance to miss, then there's a 0.000000634*100% chance you'll miss 10 times in a row. If a level 20 rogue misses 10 times in a row, the mob he's fighting probably just killed him. How many mobs do you fight while leveling up? How many characters do you have? How many players are there? At some point, Blizzard may say there's only a certain level of unluckiness they are willing to tolerate and take the quest drop algorithm over to combat resolution as well.<br>

</div>Yeah, I've thought a bit about doing that. It would be doable if you had a big enough data set but there are a lot of complicating factors to deal with (higher crit vs. lower level mobs, lower crit vs. higher level mobs, resilience on PvP targets...) so you'd also need a very clean data set, which makes it slightly tougher. Maybe once WoW's combat log 2.0 is out.<br>

		<div id="post_message_580430">Problem for group wide buffs is that AP is not of same value to others as it is for us. In fact we have one of the lowest AP of melee classes imo. So actual value of T4 2-set is very hard to decide, and could use some input from those respective classes: rogues, warriors and retribution paladins.<br>
<br>
The reason why other classes values applies to it is that because AP is the base of evaluation for other stats so if for example shamans have highest value for AP then will overvalue the bonus considerably probably.<br>
<br>
EDIT:<br>
<br>
If you get such buffs and individual boost setups equal then always go for individual boost. This is based on cold reality -- if someone in group dies then group buff value diminishes while individual will not. And well if you die yourself, it wont matter as group buff gone as well.</div>

And that someone could have died easily anyway, because he had two mobs on him or something. Or he might have been in a party, got some heals and survived. Another one killed the mob, and his unlucky streak might have been distributed over two mobs (e.g. 5misses on first mob, first mob gets killed by party member. 5 misses on next mob). Or he might have died after the first 5 misses, rezzed, and died again (another 5 misses) and just decided it wasn't his day?<br>

</div>Hmm, didn't know about that bug. I could easily think that the boss mobs just had two different loot tables associated at  their creation and chose which table to use (alliance vs horde) on first damage. (although admittedly this doesn't make much sense from a logical point of view)<br>

</div>You mean they specifically coded a mob there which could drop <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302195334/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=812"><span  ><span class="purplename">[Glowing Brightwood Staff]</span></span></a> AND showed it beforehand? Because the first time I heard about these mobs was because someone saw one of them walking around with this huge glowing staff, killed him and got that specific loot. <br>
And they also coded other mob spawns with hardcoded loot table of a grey dagger AND showing it in his hands?<br>

If we really want to go down this way, I'd suggest heading to the appropriate topic (either <a rel="nofollow" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302195334/http://elitistjerks.com/f15/t16988-thesis_how_loot_tables_work/?highlight=loot+generation" target="_blank">http://elitistjerks.com/f15/t16988-t...oot+generation</a> or <a rel="nofollow" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302195334/http://elitistjerks.com/f15/t17514-rng_raiding_system_time_change/?highlight=loot+generation" target="_blank">RNG Raiding System: Time for a change?</a> or even another one, I'm not sure which is the better one).<br>
<br>
Anyway, until some kind of "proof"* is shown that Blizzard is doctoring with the RNG against extremely lucky/unlucky strings, I won't believe in it. <br>
<br>
* And as this is most likely on the order of "proving a negative", I don't think there will be any proof.<br>

Of course, systems being what they are the most random thing about ANY MMO RNG will be the order in which the numbers are requested by clients, making the actual distribution of randoms or existence of patterns less meaningful.</div>

</div>Thanks, I missed that paragraph. The point of my post wasn't to argue that one weapon combo is better than another, but to give people some numbers to work with, as I hadn't recalled seeing any. After searching, I think I found the post Malan is referencing <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302183920/http://elitistjerks.com/417434-post512.html" target="_blank">here</a>, though the poster doesn't include any sim data<br>
<br>
From his post, Ikuturso hit a Blasted Lands mob using both combos Rod of the Sun King/Syphon for 30 minutes with each combo, and didn't use Stormstrike. My tests lasted over two hours with each combo and I used Stormstrike. His tests yielded ~5% difference in the percentage of WFs eaten by the MH between combos, and mine yielded ~3% difference. I can't really draw any conclusions except that there's a discrepancy, but I find any live tests shorter than an hour don't allow enough time to smooth proc streakiness. So maybe my test is more accurate, but it doesn't seem to be any more useful atm. Guess I should find the average WF and SS dmg for each combo so I can refute/support Ikuturso's findings</div>

</div>Here is the post with charts from simple sim showing how many WFs are "stolen" by another hand depending on different weapon speeds. <br>

Charts are almost symmetric in 2.5-2.8  area and it was unclear from them, if 2.6/2.8 weapon combo is better over 2.8/2.6.  Partially in attempt to find an answer I wrote complex sim and result it gives is 2.6/2.8=2.8/2.6. <br>

</div>I guess it's not that important at low levels, but generally Str &gt; Agi &gt; AP. Up to level 30, where you get Windfury, it might even be a good idea to collect a bit of spell damage to augment Flametongue. But below 60 (maybe even below 70) your best bet is to check the AH and do instances regularly to keep your gear up to date. In <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302183920/http://elitistjerks.com/f15/t18857-twinking_tricks_leveling_alts/" target="_blank">this thread</a> (if you haven't read it already) you can find lots of great hints on how to improve your gear early on. And, by the way, how do you know the simulator has hung up? Depending on your PC and the number of hours you wanted it to simulate, it can take quite a while to finish. Try a really low hour setting (1 hr, maybe) and see if it runs through. Then work your way up.<br>
<br>
On an unrelated note, I have a question myself. Various sources (most notably the "manual" for DisqoDice's WF cooldown timer) suggest that it is a good idea to wait with Stormstrike until the WF cooldown is ready again. Why is that? Maybe it would be a good idea to include the answer in the "Windfury Mechanics" section of the OP.</div>

</div>I don't think it is so much that as much as most people don't really bother min/maxing while they are leveling.  Particularly with the speed of leveling now any gear you get at level 25 just makes less an less of a difference in your quest to make 70.<br>

Now if we are talking BG twinking that is a different deal all together, but I don't think he was.</div>

</div>Thought this called for simulation: 200 AP, 10% crit, <b>0</b>% hit, no buffs, no shocks, talents commensurate with level 42 (Flurry, DW &amp; SS), attacking a mob with 2000 armor.<br>
<br>
2x 28.1dps 2.7s weapons: 170 dps<br>
1x 35.7dps 3.4s weapon: 128 dps<br>
2x 28.1dps 1.6s weapons: 145 dps<br>
<br>
Of course, this is simulating a level 70 attacking a level 73 mob, but I think it's akin to a level 42 mob attacking a level 45 elite.</div>

		<div id="post_message_586355">Personally, I'd say that you're absolutely fine to go DW once you hit level 44 and can be specced into Stormstrike and 3/3 Dual Wield Specialization. That's certainly enough hit rating to make it worthwhile.<br>
<br>
The only downside is that you end up needing to find two nice one-hands, but if you can't find two slow weapons I don't think there's a big problem using a MH with WF and an OH with FT.</div>

</div>I guess my AH must be more robust than most, since I've already got green offhand maces "of the Tiger" at level 42 (2.7 speed) and 48 (2.8 speed) stashed away for when my wee one gets to those levels. My playing around with the simulator gave similar results to Toots (although I used slightly higher numbers for AP and crit). I understand that the simulator may not be perfect for lower levels, but as I blast through levels I don't think it's going to be often that I'm fighting mobs more than +1, especially since the quest xp boosts mean I won't be grinding much, if at all. At those relative mob levels, is  +hit really all that necessary?</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Here is the post with charts from simple sim showing how many WFs are "stolen" by another hand depending on different weapon speeds. <br>

Charts are almost symmetric in 2.5-2.8  area and it was unclear from them, if 2.6/2.8 weapon combo is better over 2.8/2.6.  Partially in attempt to find an answer I wrote complex sim and result it gives is 2.6/2.8=2.8/2.6. <br>
Here is another, more clear combined chart for Malan's section of wiki:<br>

</div>After this post there was a bit of discussion about theridge in the graph for equal-speed weapons. They appear inferior, but then someone asked if the sim took into account the benefit match-speed weapons had from both being haste for the final (third) hit in flurry. Yo said that the sim did not account for that. I did not see any further discussion about this on the following few pages.<br>
<br>
Did further work show that the third-flurry-hit benefit outweighs the loss shown in the sim, for DWing identical-speed weapons?</div>

<br>
For equipment choices, I've been using the "pre-raid" pawn string provided in the original post. I'm not sure how accurate it is for leveling up since it is designed for lvl 70 but it seems to have worked well thus far. My gear is all quest rewards or AH greens.<br>

As Pyre mentions, it is usually not necessary to fight +1 or higher mobs a whole lot, since it is pretty effective to do lower quests and reap the extra quest xp via quicker killing.</div>

Been running Yo's sim for hours to get decent average values for stats. I should have kings changes added correctly and typical buffs I have tagged.

I really get low value for crit and agi compared to example stats on first post. <br>

Armor pen, haste and hit rating looks pretty much ok but crit/agi values are quite low. It just might be that I have too low AP which would favour AP heavily for a while... Those values doesn't seem to affect that much for possible upgrades I could have in near future.</div>

<br>
Strength is actually significantly more important than agility/crit rating at earlier levels, due to crits scaling based on AP. It's easy to start DWing at 44 when you max out DW Specialization (even before) simply because having your AP scale better generally outweighs the misses. Not to mention it gives you a better chance of proccing WF, which is so much of your DPS. <br>
<br>
Here's a sample of my EP values:<br>
<br>
AP - 1<br>
Crit rating - 0.99<br>
Hit rating - 1.11<br>
Haste rating - 0.54<br>
Armor penetration - 0.11<br>
Strength - 2<br>
Agility - 0.88<br>
Expertise rating - 1.18<br>

That was only after one test at 10,000 hours, so it may not be incredibly accurate, but it's interesting, I think. <br>
<br>
2.7 (32.1 DPS)/2.7 DW (28.1) (11.74% crit, 570 AP, 6% hit): 238 DPS<br>

Just today I picked up Gladiator's Pummeler (2.6 speed, 91.2dps), and I need to know if I should replace my MH or OH with it. My current MH is Reflex Blades (2.7 speed, 71.7dps) and my OH is Stormreaver Warblades (1.6 speed, 71.6dps). I'm currently using WF on my Mh and FT on my OH. Should I use Gladiator's Pummeler as my OH and do WF/WF or use Gladiator's Pummeler as my MH and do WF/FT? Does the benefit of an epic on the MH with an OH with FT outweigh the effect of WF/WF with the epic in the OH?<br>

I'm looking for the 2 weapons that will give me the most DPS, and (if you can figure it out) the best weapon combo for PvP.</div>

</div>No, you're 100% right in your calculations. I, personally, prefer to calculate based on pure stats. If they're within approx 4 or 5 EP, depending on the item, AND one has hit on it, I'll go with that; however, I don't like the concept of sacrificing 12-15 EP for Hit, when it doesn't make much of a difference.</div>

Do you seriously not weight hit when you are comparing loot for yourself?<br>

EDIT:  Sorry, you answered the question when I had the compose message up.<br>

IMO you discount hit a little too much.  White damage still makes a up a huge chunk of damage for a shaman.</div>

</div>There's nothing wrong with hit rating and it would be a mistake to discount it. It has an EP value just like any other stat. It's just barely worse than crit rating for me(as you can see by the EP values I posted previously.)</div>

</div>I've been raiding with under 100 hit since I set foot in BT, and now at 48 hit, I'm landing in the Top 4 on pretty much every melee friendly encounter. I feel hit is being highly over-valued in the stat weights, so rather than take the time and find a decent value for it, I just ignore it, and my DPS has been steadily climbing. In my final item selection, I will have 75 hit, and that's more than enough for me. -shrug-<br>
<br>
Edit: I still have a lot of the same final gear choices.<br>

</div>It would depend on the outcome of the stats... If the difference was just that 2.2 EP vs. the 20 hit... No, I wouldn't. But to lose 16 EP for 17 hit... Not worth it in my opinion. If I were to give hit a value and try to evaluate stats with it... I'd say MAYBE... .75  But for me, I really just look at the outcome. If an item is way ahead in raw stats, I'm not giving that up for hit. I just don't see any justification for it.<br>
<br>
Another Note: In my final setup (if you're using Shoulderpads of the Stranger), a Shaman would have 9 Expertise and 124 Hit. which even the pro-hit fiends would enjoy.<br>
<br>
<br>
Edit: I'm not saying that I want to avoid hit at all costs... I'm just saying that sacrificing a large portion of stats for hit seems highly flawed to me. Especially when I've experienced in the game how little having low hit effects my DPS.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Is it possible for you to get a WWS log of a raid or 2? You said earlier that you "get top 4 on dps", however with no numbers that means very little. For example you could be getting top 4 dmg with 1200 dps or top 4 dmg with 1800 dps and thats a huge difference.<br>
<br>
If you want your theory to hold water you need to show some numbers.</div>

	</table>
</div>As I said, I was mainly just posting due to my personal experience with Hit Rating. Malan wants to talk about simulators and this and that... Using information from YOUR THEORIES to further prove YOUR THEORIES is clearly better than realtime trials. I don't really care if my findings are widely accepted, as I've seen and discovered them to be accurate, but when Malan is clearly stating in his OP that "hit is just less important than the others[stats]" and then wants to justify that the OP is correct in it's ridiculously high value for Hit makes no sense to me. As my itemization on the previous page shows, I'm not running all over looking for items without hit. I'm doing what is suggested in the OP, and picking up the highest PURE STAT items in the game and picking up whatever hit comes along the way. I'd like Malan to show exactly how it's possible that, for a Shaman, Hit can possibly be worth as much as Agility... It makes no sense whatsoever, and I will never itemize as such.<br>
<br>
If you guys want to, go right ahead! If it somehow makes sense to you, I fully support you, and I hope it works out for ya; however, I'm not just going to read a site and take what it tells me as fact until I can see some in-game evidence. And from everything I've experienced... As I swap hit items for stat items, DPS increases substantially.</div>

<br>
Tambard: Since you are such a fan of theorycraft, do you agree that your white damage misses? And if it does, do you agree that increasing your hit rating will make you gain DPS by more white damage? Thus hit rating is a valuable stat, right? It may not be of equal value to str, AP, crit or ag, but it matters.<br>
<br>
You should be very careful to claim stuff based on observations. Observations are seldom enough data for empirical evidence. And even if you do, look at your SWS data and figure out how much DPS gained you have from, say 5 AP or 20 hit rating. It should be doable to reverse engineer your attacks to apply the two additions. I expect you to see the hit gain come out on top.</div>

Looking through the weaponry currently available for me, I am pondering what the next move to make is.<br>
<br>
I am in a guild that is 5/6 SSC and 3/4 TK and we are STRICTLY working on Vashj.  That means that going into TK and getting Netherbane is kind of a lost cause at this point.<br>
<br>
I am currently wielding dual S1 Axes (both 2.6 speed obviously).  I am 2 weeks away from the S2 Axe (need 600 more arena points).  Once I get the S2 Axe, I plan to use it as my MH.  In saying that, what is going to be my best bet for an OH until Alar drops Netherbane?  Should I just stick with my S1 Axe in my OH for the time being?<br>

Thanks for your help.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Using Fists of Mukoa, Boneweave Girdle and Softstep Boots of Tracking gives me about an extra 30 seconds of totem twisting, which ends up mattering on encounters like Illidari Council, Mother Shahraz and Gurtogg. If I didn't totem twist it really would be impossible to run out of mana and I would definitely prefer the other options.</div>

</div>Thanks. I also wear mostly leather, just of lower ilvl than yours, so we have similar unbuffed mana pools. I was totem twisting tonight for the first six bosses of BT without any mana problems, but I was using rank 1 WFT rather than max rank. I will try twisting with max rank later this week, and see if I run into the same problems you describe. (As I'm a novice twister, it's also quite possible that I'm just less efficient in using my GCDs and so I get less GoA uptime and fewer shocks but use less mana.)</div>

		<div id="post_message_610759">Hi<br>
<br>
Monster of a thread here. But I have found a lot of good useful information so far. Thanks.<br>
<br>
My question is regarding professions, which I haven't been able to find anything about. Seems the best would probably be to get blacksmithing, but don't wanna do that again. <br>
<br>
So I came up with leatherworking, which seems to be a bit useful. Was sure Dragonscale would be the specialization to get, but after looking into it I'm no longer sure. It seems Elemental is the way to go.<br>
<br>
Looking at the epic pieces you can make Primalstrike comes out a little bit better with the wrists and waist, but only a bit, so you could justify getting the Netherscale for the extra armor and int. The Primalstrike chest seems so much better that the Netherscale though, meaning it is no longer justified getting Netherscale for the extra stats.<br>
<br>
Is this conclusion right, or is there any other opinions?<br>
<br>
Edit: Made an alliance shaman on another server to play with some friends. Meaning I probably won't have access to the same level of gear as my paladin.</div>

Put your stats in the simulator, run it for 1000+ hours, write down your new AEP values; ifyou  put those in enhancer it will even work out for you which items an an upgrade and how much of an upgrade they represent.<br>

Really, it is all there if people were a little less lazy. I found all the information you just asked for, myself, less than a week ago, using the search functions of this forum and a little time of my own.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">After your mana pool has shrunk a bunch from using a lot of leather, I think intellect actually starts to matter a little bit if you totem twist. While generally stats like mp5 and intellect are totally meaningless to us, you still do need a large enough base mana pool to sustain the twisting cycle in between SR's. Intellect and mp5 are definitely terrible. But at this point, when I'm deciding between two items that are equivalent dps-wise, I'll normally take whichever one has more intellect.<br>
<br>
Using Fists of Mukoa, Boneweave Girdle and Softstep Boots of Tracking gives me about an extra 30 seconds of totem twisting, which ends up mattering on encounters like Illidari Council, Mother Shahraz and Gurtogg. If I didn't totem twist it really would be impossible to run out of mana and I would definitely prefer the other options.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</div>I pretty much follow this as well.  Once a shamy hits enough of a mana pool to be able to sustain twisting until SR is back up, there is 0 need for int or mana/5 on gear.  Sure the Souls leather gloves have 3 more agi then fists, but enhance does need a decent mana pool which depending on how much leather is used, can be a pain.  <br>
<br>
As said, for me Int and Stam are both tie-breakers in choosing gear.  I wont use them in the initial calculations, but they help when theres a tiny EAP difference between 2 pieces of gear.</div>

Put your stats in the simulator, run it for 1000+ hours, write down your new AEP values; ifyou  put those in enhancer it will even work out for you which items an an upgrade and how much of an upgrade they represent.<br>
<br>
Really, it is all there if people were a little less lazy. I found all the information you just asked for, myself, less than a week ago, using the search functions of this forum and a little time of my own.</div>

	</table>
</div>I agree, but you have situations where a list like the one I asked for and Sebudai provided is a great help. When you transfer from T5 content to T6, your upgrade path is unclear. Item A may be a better upgrade for me than item B, but after replacing maybe 60% of my set, B is the best in-slot item. AEP is dynamic and sometimes is near impossible to find the best in-slot item because you don't have the under-laying other best-in slot items to base your AEP on.<br>
<br>
Maybe create a list in the OP with "Awesomest gear evar! STFU", so helpless nabbs like myself can look up what to aim for? It may be a flame magnet for some as we've seen with the recent "lol hit is bad kk", I don't know. It's useful information.</div>

</div>I'm not that familiar with lootrank.com, but you should get an accurate result if you subtract (&lt;expertise weight&gt; * &lt;unused expertise rating part&gt;) from the specific item, in this case that would be 3.52 * 0.57, so subtract about 2 EP from the item value.</div>

I did a bit of comparison using the weapon EP values we derived a while back, and I think he's probably right. Using those "weapon EP" number's, here are the two lists I got, all the way down to S1 weapons as a "baseline/any idiot can get these". Do note that this analysis does not take into account the differences between a 2.6 and a 2.8 weapon, but I can't be arsed to run every possible weapon through the sim. I did cheat a little bit and since I knew Dragonstrike/Dragonmaw were better than the axes for non-orcs, bumped them up (since I didn't do the math on the haste proc), and since I knew that Syphon was basically the same DPS as Rising Tide, I bumped it up (since I didn't do the math on the shadow proc).

</div>OK. Then it would probably make sense to put the T3 BS weapons, the BT weapons, and Talon on the same level. In that case, the list looks pretty similar to what's in the main post right now but with just the Talon moved up as you have suggested already. Your posts suggest to me that maybe you've gone through and ran all the MH weapons against each other with your own stats -- is that the case? If so, care to reproduce the list for us? I know that this all might seem a bit unnecessary, but it seems to me that having a list of weapons for the main post (like a list of trinkets) is useful due to the complexity of many of the procs, weapon speed interactions, and the relative difficulty of summing weapon DPS EP and item EP, if for no other reason than to reduce the number of "what weapon is best?" questions. (Though those have been reduced in days past, so maybe the main post is already doing enough on this front.)</div>

		<div id="post_message_627540">I've tried asking this question on the PvP Shaman thread, but didn't see a for sure answer.  I'm hoping for a solid 'it works this way' answer.  <br>
<br>
I'm trying to get clarification on the Purge mechanic when attempting to use it on either a NPC or PC.<br>
<br>
When you cast Purge, it can dispell two enemy buffs.  Is each chance to dispell rolled seperately?  IE, If I'm attempting to purge a mob or a enemy in PvP, can I cast Purge, have one buff resist the purge, and the other buff be cleared?  Or does a resist on one buff resist the purge to both buffs?  <br>
<br>
I know I've looked through a lot to try and find this but if I missed it I'm sorry.  Thanks!</div>

</div>I run through all the weapons I have access to(I don't pvp) whenever my gear changes a bunch or the sim gets a significant update, unfortunately I haven't recorded the results. The last time(2 more items from an ideal set) it came out DS&gt;Talon&gt;Syphon&gt;RT all separated by a handful of DPS. <br>
<br>
I think estimates based on the EP of the items are OK for the most part but not taking into account weapon speed seems to be a problem since it has a significant impact in the sim. As an example setting it up with Syphon/Syphon stats then dropping the MH from 2.8 to 2.6 results in a ~20DPS loss.</div>

</div>This is actually a reasonably easy to recreate scenario.<br>
Grab a priest/druid/mage/pally, whoever can cast 2 or more buffs on themself.<br>
Take off as much of your spell hit as you can.<br>
Hopefully your buddy has the talents (if available) for XX% resistance to having buffs dispelled.<br>
Challenge them to a duel.<br>
They should have at least two purgeable buffs on themselves.<br>
Purge them<br>
Count how many were removed (or use an addon that announces for you).<br>
<br>
<br>
That said, I've finally broken down and done some BGs on my shaman, I have seen several single buff removal purges while the target in question had a great many buffs still on them. I've seen at least as many times when I purge nothing. This is all adhoc information though. I don't have a screen cap of me purging some priest and only getting his shadow prot buff, but leaving fort/spirit/innerfire.</div>

I inserted Sebudai's T6 EP values and got this list: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080210144531/http://www.lootrank.com/wow/rank.asp?Cla=64&amp;Max=10&amp;Slot=0&amp;Gem=4&amp;Art=0&amp;Dif=199&amp;Str=2.2&amp;Arm=0&amp;Exp=3.15&amp;mp5=0&amp;Sta=0&amp;Def=0&amp;mcr=1.72&amp;heal=0&amp;Agi=1.67&amp;Dod=0&amp;mhit=1.71&amp;spc=0&amp;Int=0&amp;blv=0&amp;map=1&amp;sph=0&amp;Spi=0&amp;blr=0&amp;fap=0&amp;spd=0&amp;par=0&amp;arp=0.36&amp;fid=0&amp;Sckm=70&amp;res=0&amp;mh=1.82&amp;frd=0&amp;dps=0&amp;ard=0&amp;odps=0&amp;nad=0&amp;rdps=0&amp;shd=0&amp;has=0&amp;spp=0" target="_blank">Loot Rank</a> (couldn't remember RED's value so I just made something up).<br>
<br>
In the three most important armor slots, head, chest, legs, you lose a crapload of EP going for T6 over best in-slot.<br>
<br>
Edit: Numbers show that you lose a whopping 181.21 EP by using T6 over the three best head, chest and leg items. That's the ~ EP value of shoulder/gloves. So in theory, you could take those three best in-slot items, and un-equip gloves and still be tied with T6. Funny thought.</div>

</div>The problem is that the non-set is <b>better at every step of the way</b>. T6 only comes close when you add in the +70 AP set bonus. So for every piece of gear you grab until 4/5 T6, non-set is a lot better choice, then at 4/5 T6, non-set is a little better, then once you are in Sunwell and start losing T6, non-set is a lot better.</div>

Disregarding that, I prefer Tier 6 because it offers me more survivability for a little drop in DPS. It's also a hell of a lot easier to keep up Twisting with the added intellect. Don't get me wrong, I know you can sustain Twisting with the other set too (I've done it before) but the t6 gives me a little more leeway with it in case we have no Ret Paladin with us and JoW falls off. All in all it depends on my mood. If I want to break DPS records, I'll use nonset. If I want a calm evening with a little more leeway to survive AoE damage and whatever you want to name, I'll wear Tier 6.</div>

Comparing the raw stats, you could think it should be a much bigger difference. But i did several (about 8-10 each) 50.000 hours simulations to proof this.<br>

Comparing items, which are on the same itemlevel but on our ep comparisons 20-30% better/worse and have in the end only such a small impact on your possible max dps makes me sad. There is no real need to buff tier 6, nor a season 3 over a bt weapon or cursed vision over tier 4 helmet improves our dps by such a wide margin like it does for other dps classes. It might feel better from looking at the back of your character and seeing differend shoulder design every few month, but my dps didn't jump like mad since i got my t4/t5 gear, but our rogues/fury ones did. Don't understand my wrong, i don't wand to make this post a whining post, just wanted to support Illundai claim by a personal note.</div>

</div>Oh, I'm not claiming HUGE differences in DPS. I'm saying I don't buy the original claim that "the difference is so marginally small". I didn't calculate the set bonus which will reduce the EP gap so it's not as terrifying as I first thought. I should of course have asked you what you meant "small" is in this case, but IMHO we should refrain from such without numbers in a theorycrafting thread.<br>

</div>Misunderstanding from both sides, which is okay. Maybe marginally small is exaggerated, but I honestly think it matters very little - it's personal flavour. Do you like the extra stam/int? Or do you not care and want to push DPS all the time? It's a bit like the Ele vs Resto discussion.</div>

Wish I had some actual numbers to support/disprove T6 as a replacement. But all I've got is the same thing I harp on all the time.<br>
<br>
STAMINA: tier 6 swims in the stuff.<br>
Tier6 offers a gigantic bucket of stamina over the best non-tier pieces, and it reduces the cost of your shocks. These two benefits make it very appropriate for fighting the Illidari council where you won't get anywhere near a full shamanistic rage's worth of mana back.<br>
<br>
YOUR RAID: our loot rules and raid luck have left me in non-tier healing pieces, ymmv.<br>
Your raid's luck and loot rules will influence whether you wear cursed vision and midnight chest much, much, much more than whether non-set provides 100DPS more or just 20DPS more than taking tier6.<br>
We've had 1 cursed vision drop and zero midnight chestguards, we only killed vashj 6 times or so, zero belts/shoulders but dammit we literally got 7 cobra-lash boots out of 6 kills (ok, that's an exaggeration).<br>
<br>
Pretty soon, you'll get 3 tier6 tokens, but Archi will drop the same damn 2handed sword and bow again... week after week. Your rogues already 2 bristles each, but there it is again... If it wasn't for attunements, you'd have sold Archimonde slots to pug hunters because the bow will drop.... sorry for the rant.</div>

He went on to mention that he doesn't drop WFT.  Apparently in his raid, first priority goes to the raiders with the top numbers in parses.  When he drops WFT, his DPS proportional to his rogues' DPS went way down, and he gets bumped for not pulling his weight.  So he drops GoA.<br>

</div>Hey, it's cool if you can't figure out tools like the simulator, because there are even easier tools that don't involve us doing your math homework.  They're much less accurate, but they're easy.  Go to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080210212805/http://maxdps.com/shaman/enhancement.php" target="_blank">MaxDPS.com - Enhancement Shaman DPS Gear Rankings</a> and enter your stats.  Notice how the one helm is really far down the list, and the other is sort of near the top?  Guess which one's better!</div>

</div>The Gladiator's helm with the meta will provide superior DPS.  Even without the 3% crit damage, the overall AP/hit/crit stats point toward better damage with the Gladiator's helm.  Add in the additional effect from the meta, and it gets even better. Hope that helps.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I was mentioning to a fairly skilled t6 raider on my server the other week that <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080210212805/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=33222"><span  ><span class="purplename">[Nyn'jah's Tabi Boots]</span></span></a> were a bit better (~20 EP) than the <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080210212805/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=30104"><span  ><span class="purplename">[Cobra-Lash Boots]</span></span></a> he was wearing.<br>
<br>
His answer was, "Dude, if my raid saw I traded a Vashj drop for Karazhan badge gear, I'd never raid with them again."<br>
<br>
He went on to mention that he doesn't drop WFT.  Apparently in his raid, first priority goes to the raiders with the top numbers in parses.  When he drops WFT, his DPS proportional to his rogues' DPS went way down, and he gets bumped for not pulling his weight.  So he drops GoA.<br>
<br>
Point is there's lots of reasons why we don't follow theorycraft.  That doesn't change the theory.</div>

</div>Have him kindly point his raid leader to this thread and some math showing how to determine what gear is better than others.

Similarly, if his raid leader doesn't understand that an enhancement shaman brings his actual DPS + the sum of the DPS from buffs he gives his group, and that sometimes he is willing to sacrifice his own damage for the betterment of the raid, I'm very surprised they've gotten as far as they have.  I'd also be Looking For Guild.</div>

		<div id="post_message_629783">Hello everyone.  I was wondering if it would be a good idea to maybe add ballpark sustained dps figures to the wiki or this post for various end-game boss fights for people to use as a comparison.<br>
<br>
Given average T5/T6 gear, and using the idea melee group listed on page one, is there a shaman out there who has a lot of WWS data available to provide these numbers?<br>
<br>
E.g. <br>
<br>
Teron Gorefiend:  1600 dps<br>
Illidari Council:  1100 dps<br>
etc.<br>
<br>
Of course, dps changes from fight to fight depending on many factors including your gear, your group, etc, but thats why im stressing "ballpark" figures. <br>
<br>
Good idea?  Terrible idea?  <br>
<br>
Cheers all.</div>

</div>Very true.  And many other constraints like your group makeup, your gear level, tank threat generation, etc, etc.<br>
<br>
I suppose that's why i suggested ball park values, perhaps even ranges.<br>
<br>
So assuming threat's not an issue, its not your first kill, you have T5/T6 gear, and you're in an ideal Melee group:<br>
<br>
Teron Gorefiend:  1500 - 1800 dps. <br>
Illidan:   1 - 1600 dps<br>
<br>
Or something like that.   <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080210212805im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/wink.gif" border="0" alt="" title=";)" class="inlineimg"></div>

Council 850 dps without twisting.<br>
Mother 750 dps without twisting (for obvious reasons).<br>

But why don't you ran the simulator and multiply the given dps with 0.8 (20% human error) or check the huge wws pool for some data.<br>

Rage: If you have a lot of death and decay on your tank, you can't dps. <br>
Anetheron: If you have all of the infernals on the melees, you have to save your ass.<br>
Council: If you can't trust your camphealer for any reason (eg. they struggle or they are dead), have a lot of aoe in melee range beside the consecrate, you can't dps.<br>
<br>
If someone didn't keep up an important buff all the time and you didn't realise it, the data will be corrupted.<br>

If you can't reach the given number or break them easily, it says nothing. Did you shock enough and didn't break the record? Critluck was with everyone expect you?

</div>Loud and clear.  Ill try to scrape together some averages from the public WWS data available once the WWS site gets a little more stable (laggy for anyone else?).  I would just like to see some averages, under normal circumstances, average fight durations, etc.   Just something new shamans can use as an anchor in analyzing their own WWS reports (as opposed to linking them here :P).<br>

</div>Changing the subject a bit, I didn't see any discussion of proper cooldown stacking in the OP.  I noticed in your Teron kill, Illundai, that you didn't seem to stack haste cooldowns much.  Is this intentional?  I would think that using Drums of Battle/Haste Pot/Berserker's Call all together at the start would provide the largest benefit, and then 2m later you could use those 3 again along with Shamanistic Rage and Heroism.  Or Shamanistic Rage earlier, if you don't want to wait the 2m to start getting mana back.<br>
<br>
Forgive me if I'm missing some commonly known fact about haste usage on a shaman, trying to get some TC knowledge from this thread to prep for raiding on a shaman in the exp; currently I raid exclusively on a paladin.</div>

</div>Well like I said, I messed up my BC's first use so I didn't get the max out of that. We had a ret paladin so Sham Rage was only used to shield myself from incoming damage when raid damage was at a high point. I used Haste pot as soon as aggro was stable during the heroism. We also had a bit of a messy Drums rotation, so we didn't get all of them rolling either.<br>

</div>These values seem very conservative, on Teron you should be aiming for atleast 1200 DPS I'd say, which should be easily achieved. I've not been below 1500 dps on teron for months and months now.<br>
<br>
I can't see any reason to go below 1000 DPS on mother either, if you are severly gimping yourself with max SR gear (without enchants) then you really don't need too. I've found having around 250 buffed is sufficient for me especially with the use of SR on an attraction.<br>
<br>
Council very much depends on your luck with the aoe, last kill I had 1500 dps but some weeks only 1000.<br>
<br>
I think a reasonable "base" value for all BT/Hyjal raiding shamans would be 1000 DPS on each boss.</div>

I'm a resto shammy, and respecced last night just to see how my DPS would work out (mostly for fun, and we have no enh shammy atm). <br>
I'm wearing quite a few Kara pieces and some end-game pieces, and also a blue ring from a regular 70 instance and lvl62 quest reward trinket from HP :P<br>
I could use a regeming on my pants aswell (very old and did the geming very very long time ago).<br>

Anyway, I dont even have a Enh totem in my totem slot.. My gear is far from optimal, and i still produced some decent numbers there, so yes I agree. 1k DPS on Teron seems modest if you are a raiding Enh shammy.</div>

</div>Dude, we're not hunters.  You can't just macro everything to one button and be done with it.  SS/WFT/GoA is a fine macro, but you really should manage a FS/ES rotation outside of that cycle.  You'll still get the same number of shocks per cycle with this rotation, but FS is a nice addition to your dps.<br>
<br>
You're also going to see an 80-100 dps falloff from somebody who has a warrior for Battle Shout.<br>
<br>
But I think this all comes down to priority.  If you make twisting your primary goal, that comes at the expense of shocks &amp; SS.  You're going to do less DPS than somebody who's a bit more balanced.<br>
<br>
Think about it: with your macro, your shock cooldown will ALWAYS be up a half second after SS is up.  But you let that CD rest for 4 more seconds while you ride out the SS GCD and drop WFT/GoA.  It's the equivalent of having shocks on a 10s timer, rather than a 6s timer, and <br>
<br>
If you were instead to use the shock as soon as the SS GCD was up, you'd wind up with more shocks at the expense of 1.5s of WFT.  It could be substantial (shocks make up 15% of my damage when not twisting, 12% when twisting "casually" and about 9% when prioritizing WFT).  Question is, how much does it bother you?</div>

I think someone else pointed out that comparisons across WWS parses are meaningless, but you are definately at the top end of what you could do with that gear. A perfect run in my opinion for you and well done again.</div>

I just thought that 1000 DPS on average for Teron seems low, specially considering how I'm quite undergeared for the instance and did more. Nothing else.<br>

As a sidenote, someone pointed out my guilds progression as something that made it even less likely that I could do 1400 DPS, yes our guild does not have the best progress, but we have banged our head against archimonde since before christmas and was up to about 100 attempts where we decided to go back to BT 1-2 weeks ago. It took us 8 attempts in total to kill Teron (was before christmas though), and 6 to kill bloodboil. Next time we face RoS, we'll down that too. We could've been deeper, that's what I'm saying, but Archi stood in the way (still does.. *Grr*).</div>

</div>While it's true that the OP is pretty dense if you're just looking for general start-up tips for playing an enhancement shaman, if you look through it carefully you'll find what you're looking for.  Take some time over a couple days and read through it if you really want to improve your performance in groups.<br>
<br>
There's only one thing I'll stress, because it's the most common mistake newly-70 shamans make:<br>
<br>
<b>Don't use bad weapons.</b>  If your off-hand (or either hand for that matter) is much below 2.6, you're doing it wrong.  Almost every single terrible enhancement shaman I've seen (and I've seen a <i>lot</i>) have been using fast off-hands.  Read the OP if you don't understand why, but seriously.  Slow.  If it's not slow, it's not good, no matter what the DPS and stats are on it.  <br>
<br>
Looking at your armory, other than a ring and a trinket you've got the right idea.  WF both weapons, try to time your Stormstrikes outside the WF CD (Enhancer is an excellent mod for that), and you should be fine.</div>

</div>I'd like to see those numbers replicated on future attempts.  Not trying to knock you, especially since you normally play resto, but my guess is that you just hit a pretty lucky streak.  That's the wonderful and the terrible thing about Windfury.  Sometimes you get lucky at it procs wonderfully and you hit big crits every time.  Sometimes it doesn't proc all that well and you get rather mediocre crits.  Of course the slumps can be mitigated by rolling with 2.6 speeders and whatnot, but you can still hit huge valleys for certain fights as well as huge peaks.<br>
<br>
I've done entire SSC/TK runs where my damage was 100-200/300 DPS off my norm with no changes from the previous week.  I'm talking same buffs, personnel, everything equal.<br>
<br>
So, I think you'll probably be around 1000-1100 DPS normally (which is still awesome) and you got a nice fight in at 1358.  Probably not consistently repeatable with that gear tho.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">If your tank is good or your gear is bad you can open with Stormstrike, Flame Shock, totems, Earth Shock. If your tank needs time to grab aggro, drop totems first (WF if he's a warrior, it will give you more room on threat) and then start in on the DPS.<br>

Do at least the daily BG and save honor points for a <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080211105616/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=28308"><span  ><span class="purplename">[Gladiator's Cleaver]</span></span></a>.

Make an effort to get at least 2 pieces since the 2-piece bonus is very nice. Ditch items that don't contribute at all to melee stats. Once you are geared enough to go to heroics, do so.

				<div style="font-style:italic">So, <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080228003016/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=31288"><span  ><span class="bluename">[The Master's Treads]</span></span></a> has more EP but overall is it a superior piece of gear? I don't have mana issues too often but it seems like the additional armor has some benefit when I'm a bit squishy at this point.<br>
<br>
In sum, should one always base gear selection factors on EP or are there times when other factors (like armor, intellect, MP5, etc.) should be considered when EP is close. Obviously if two pieces of gear have the same EP these additional factors would make one piece superior. How big of a difference in EP is necessary before one would pass up these additional features?</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</div>Additional armor has almost no benefit.  For one, you should never be hit by any mob that does physical damage; most of the damage you take will be AoE magic for which armor is useless.  Second, the difference between a shaman in ALL mail and a shaman in ALL leather is something like 10-15% DR and the difference between swapping out a single piece of mail for a single piece of leather is like 1% DR.  Not negligible, but from a healer's perspective hardly noticeable.<br>
<br>
Stamina is extremely useful, up to the point that you have enough for your healers to be able to keep you alive.  Beyond that, it has little value aside from slightly de-stressing your healers.  I keep a set of high(er) stam gear around for helping out new healers, but my raiding gear has 7800 health and I'd gladly sacrifice 800-1000 of that for more DPS.<br>
<br>
When it comes to EP: I will take an upgrade that is ONE EP better than what I have, if it's going to get burnt otherwise.  I will actively seek any upgrade that's 10 or more EP better than what I have.  90 EP vs 100 EP doesn't seem like a lot, but it's 2.5 DPS.  Make that trade off on every armor slot, and you've just lost 30+ dps.  If you wear<br>
<br>
I almost never look at the other stats.  Some items -- <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080228003016/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=33528"><span  ><span class="purplename">[Gauntlets of Sniping]</span></span></a> vs <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080228003016/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=33539"><span  ><span class="purplename">[Trickster's Stickyfingers]</span></span></a> (a 5 EP difference for me) -- are so close, I can almost convince myself it's worth the negligible survivability to pick mail.  But these are rare, and I am aware that I am gimping myself.</div>

</div>Please stop.  Shaman DPS is a feedback system and the "best" weapons will vary dramatically by your EP, which changes every time you add an upgrade or change buffs you receive in raid.  I dislike the concept of a "set" EP for T4/5/6 because this implies a level of homogeneity that does not exist.  These are (I guess) useful from a theoretical standpoint, but bad when dealing with reality.<br>
<br>
Shamans need to be mindful of this.  A static list does not help them get there, it just reinforces a false assumption.<br>
<br>
As an example -- a while back, <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080228003016/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=28657"><span  ><span class="purplename">[Fool's Bane]</span></span></a> was about a 20 point upgrade for my offhand.  Last I simulated it, it was nearly dead even -- because in the meantime, I'd added a lot of crit, hit rating, haste rating &amp; armor pen, and the value of offhand weapon DPS went up.<br>
<br>
What's more, what is important is not the BEST weapon, it's "is this weapon upgrade I am presented with worth the DKP/Honor/Grind cost" -- a question which can only be answered for an individual's gear.  Malchazeen may well be an upgrade for some.  It should also be a cue to farm up a better weapon.</div>

</div>Well, the problem with this test is that the "best in game" stuff isn't what an individual cares about ranking.  It's immediate upgrades.  There isn't a lot of "best" gear, it all comes from the same two dungeons, and it's already been mentioned that at T5 levels certain upgrades (the Talon is what I'm thinking of) actually outperform certain T6 upgrades.  The BEST stuff outdoes them both.<br>
<br>
The problem with evaluating the BEST is that the best isn't what's accessible in most cases.  You really care about what's better, right now, for me.  Caring ONLY about the best leads to DKP hoarding and other antisocial, DPS-nerfing behaviors.</div>

		<div id="post_message_644479">The new Sunwell weapons that are becoming available, and the seeming lack of an axe to them has got me mulling over the actual impact the orc racial has on our weapon choice, or in other words, what is the actual value of Weapon expertise.<br>
<br>
The best way seems to be calculating them into Weapon EP, considering it only affects that actual hand you're wielding the weapon in. The formula's I've come up with are these:<br>
<br>
MH W-EP = 2/3 * 20 * Exp-EP<br>
OH W-EP = 1/3 * 20 * Exp-EP<br>
<br>
The 20 times expertise EP speaks for itself, that's just the EP value of the 5 expertise the racial gives. The 2/3 and 1/3 are based on the fact that the main hand does double the damage of the offhand, so the damage spread is 2/3 and 1/3 respectively.<br>
<br>
Enhancer does the awesome job of already calculating W-EP, so just tag on the calculated added EP from the orc racial and you should be able to compare them with non axes for a quick and dirty check if something is actually better or not.<br>
<br>
Anyway, my math has been proven to be wrong in the past, so I wanted to run it past you guys.<br>
<br>
Another thing that sprung to my mind is because of the unique mechanics of the racial, is how much of an impact having a non axe would have on increasing main hand windfury procs. To my knowledge dodges can't proc windfury, so in essence with your offhand getting 1.25% more dodges you should force your main hand windfury ratio up a small notch, I doubt this will have a huge impact on dps, but it might actually be worth considering. I have no idea how to go about calculating this though.</div>

</div>Well, we kind of already went over this discussion a while back. Disquette, Tornhoof, and others had introduced a way for us to obtain AEP values, and Yo! came in and said that hey, these aren't really static values, you guys shouldn't use this system. As I recall, I and Sebudai both said something like "well, it doesn't matter because the best in slot items are the same for everyone regardless", but since Yo's sim makes it so easy to get customized EP values, it makes sense to use that and then you will choose the right upgrades along the way as well.</div>

				Another thing that sprung to my mind is because of the unique mechanics of the racial, is how much of an impact having a non axe would have on increasing main hand windfury procs. To my knowledge dodges can't proc windfury, so in essence with your offhand getting 1.25% more dodges you should force your main hand windfury ratio up a small notch, I doubt this will have a huge impact on dps, but it might actually be worth considering. I have no idea how to go about calculating this though.

</div>It is not surprising that the sim gives similar results in gear choices given different starting points. The "underlying relationship" that you refer to is, simply put, shaman combat mechanics. The sim is using those to give an answer.<br>

</div>Well, we had a lot of people trying to find a "closed form" model that could accept parameters like AP, Crit, Hit as inputs and give DPS as output. You can do that *reasonably* well, which is what MaxDPS.com is doing. Tornhoof also produced something, and we had someone else coming in here who wanted to use a Cobb-Douglas function. There are currently a few problems with this approach. First, it's not easy to add extra procs like Mongoose, Stonebreaker Totem, or Madness of the Betrayer to this equation. Each variable introduces another level of complexity. Second, the best models produce something that appears to be less accurate than the margin of error in the simulation. Given the choice between the two, it appears that for now, simming is the way to go.</div>

		<div id="post_message_644729">While I was checking Lootrank with my own values compared to the T6 level values presented in OP, I noticed a trend there. While a lot of items were at the same spot on both rankings, items with either haste rating or armor penetration varied immensely. Best example would be shoulders, where with T6 values <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080228003016/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=32581"><span  ><span class="purplename">[Swiftstrike Shoulders]</span></span></a> ranked as the second best shoulders currently in game (4th overall), they were only 8th best with my values. A few posts back someone also mentioned <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080228003016/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=33528"><span  ><span class="purplename">[Gauntlets of Sniping]</span></span></a> being slightly worse for him than <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080228003016/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=33539"><span  ><span class="purplename">[Trickster's Stickyfingers]</span></span></a>, while for me they're actually 17EP higher.<br>
<br>
This made me think about items with these stats and choosing between two possible upgrades. If Item1 has 150EP with pure Agi/AP/Crit and Item2 has 140EP with AP/Crit and Haste rating on it, would Item2 actually turn out better in the long run, when I manage to find upgrades for my other slots? This would probably change my current "final" paperdoll with upgrades from ZA/Kara/Badges by quite a bit.<br>

		<div id="post_message_644733">Using the T6 item values and lootrank, the order is almost always exactly what I would expect it to be with absolutely no knowledge about enhancement shaman at all.  It's mostly sorted by item level, with exceptions exactly where you'd expect them: items with sockets appearing above items without sockets, items with more stats appearing above items with fewer stats, and items with caster stats appearing under items without caster stats.  Take <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080228003016/http://www.lootrank.com/wow/rank.asp?Cla=64&amp;Max=5&amp;Slot=0&amp;Gem=4&amp;Art=0&amp;Dif=151&amp;Str=2.2&amp;Arm=0&amp;Exp=3.18&amp;mp5=0&amp;Sta=0&amp;Def=0&amp;mcr=1.74&amp;heal=0&amp;Agi=1.69&amp;Dod=0&amp;mhit=1.69&amp;spc=0&amp;Int=0&amp;blv=0&amp;map=1&amp;sph=0&amp;Spi=0&amp;blr=0&amp;fap=0&amp;spd=0&amp;par=0&amp;arp=0.35&amp;fid=0&amp;Sckm=0&amp;res=0&amp;mh=1.82&amp;frd=0&amp;dps=0&amp;ard=0&amp;odps=0&amp;nad=0&amp;rdps=0&amp;shd=0&amp;noPvP=1&amp;has=0&amp;spp=0" target="_blank">this</a> lootrank search.  If you sorted the top 5 items in each slot by ilvl with sockets giving +15 ilvls, one caster stat giving -15 ilvls and two giving -20 ilvls, you'd get the same best item in all but three slots, and only 11 items even change position.<br>
<br>
The theoretical optimal items change significantly as your gear changes, but the items available do not.  The optimal actual items don't change because there's very few items that have the budget spent in a decent way on stats that do anything at all.  Does it really matter if hit or crit is worth more when the item selection is so bad that the third best hat has 28 int on it?  I don't think there's any magical relevation to be found other than that the itemization available is really so bad that you're more concerned with finding items that actually spend all of thier points on useful stats and sockets than finding items which spend all of thier points of the right stats.</div>

</div>This result is not surprising, though. The primary stats (everything to do with DPS except armor pen) all have the same "cost" on "item budget". To item designers, 1 STR = 1 AGI = 1 crit rating = 1 hit rating = 1 haste rating = 1 expertise rating = 2 AP. There is a second-order effect based on an exponential penalty for items which "stack" a stat, but we would not expect that to affect our results. If the game is properly designed, all these stats should impact us equally. However, there are some peculiarities to enhancement shaman mechanics, so for example, hit rating is worth more if you don't have 9% and less if you do. Kings makes strength and agility worth a bit more. Agility confers some "survival" benefits in addition to DPS benefits, so it's worth a bit less than crit rating. Again, we are basically discussing something months old here, Yo! said "well, if you want an EP system Blizzard already gave you one, it's called the item budget". The issue is that the game <b>isn't</b> perfectly balanced and that enhancement shamans <b>do</b> have some peculiarities, so the interesting choices are where the base stat values don't quite work out.</div>

		<div id="post_message_644788">Assuming you mean all melee stats, that's pretty much my point.  There's so few items that you can equip that spend itemization points on anything useful that choosing an optimal item is never an option.  Once you get to raid gear, most of the time you aren't choosing between an item with the right melee stats or the wrong melee stats, you're choosing between items with the wrong melee stats, items with no sockets, items with the wrong melee stats that are a lower ilvl, and items with int/mana regen.  Which stats you want only matters when you actually have a choice, but most of the time items with the right stats aren't even an option.  There are <b>zero</b> items in the top 5 for each slot which have the right stats at all, much less the right stats in the correct proportions, which makes worrying about what those correct proportions are somewhat pointless most of the time.</div>

I'm however porting it to Ace3, separating it into more then one AddOn (Equivalence Points is broken out into it's own AddOn etc), and some big changes for 2.4. While doing so I've not had a need to update the current version for a while though if something is broken and I find out I'll still update it of course.<br>
<br>
Also I'm a lazy bastard so I've not been arsed to put it anywhere on the "normal" AddOn sites like Curse, WoWI only <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080227062238/http://files.wowace.com/" target="_blank">World of Warcraft Addons - WowAce.com</a></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">A couple of things in this post.<br>
Firstly, i recently downloaded enhancer, and was wondering (as i haven't seen the question answered. Apologies if it has been), at what point does holding off to use Stormstrike when watching the WF cooldown icon become detrimental to dps? And even if it should be done at all?</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</div>You can sim this.  There's an option where you specify the maximum amount of time you'll wait to Stormstrike if WF is on CD when SS comes up.  Try 0, 1, 2, and 3 seconds and see what you get.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Also, in regards to the earlier question about weapon swapping to get UR up, I used to do this on fights where the positioning was such that I could get my totems down before the fight and immediately start hitting things, except instead of using two low-DPS weapons, I'd use two high-DPS but fast weapons (like the <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080227062238/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=28768"><span  ><span class="purplename">[Malchazeen]</span></span></a> I picked up solely to poke fun at rogues), because the burst damage was low and the relative frequency of crits was high.  That said, my tanks are good enough with snap aggro at the beginning of fights now that I haven't had to do that in a long time, and don't even carry the weapons with me anymore.<br>

I have enough time at the office to run multiple sims (erm, don't ask), but unfortunately we're using some very old version of Java, and to access most sites, I have to go through a proxy that messes things up.<br>

I was getting pretty decent results with a Syphon/Rod of the Sun King combo, close to 5 DPS dif as double Syphon and thus was using it as my another Syphon is yet to drop. Although the sim shows DS/Syphon as higher dps still so i'd like to know if it's correct already.</div>

</div>I can do that, probably, but I'd be curious to know if the code part works first before writing a gear check (something I've only dabbled in before).<br>
<br>
Can you see if this is all you need to do to the .lua file to make it work?<br>
<br>
change<br>
<b>		f2.statusbar:SetMinMaxValues(0,9)</b><br>
to<br>
<b>		f2.statusbar:SetMinMaxValues(0,10)</b><br>
<br>
(just changing the 2nd value parameter).<br>
<br>
then change:<br>
function DisqoDice:SSBar()<br>
	f2:Show()<br>
	gogogoSS = true<br>
<b>	SSTime = GetTime() + 10</b><br>
	SSmin, SSmax = f2.statusbar:GetMinMaxValues()<br>
<br>
to<br>
function DisqoDice:SSBar()<br>
	f2:Show()<br>
	gogogoSS = true<br>
<b>	SSTime = GetTime() + 9</b><br>
	SSmin, SSmax = f2.statusbar:GetMinMaxValues()<br>
<br>
<br>
Maybe that would do it.  If so, I could build it in to a gear check, perhaps.</div>

</div>Because i just recently rerolled from rogue and the poison vial dropped and i had nothing better. I will ding exalted with Ashtongue next reset so will use that trinket then. As for the hit gems, i don't know about you guys but pyrestones are very very limited so i can't regem atm. Though i will probably downgrade to noble topaz's until the pyrestones come my way.<br>

I'm presuming the best trinket combo after 2.4 will be the one from magisters terrace and DST? Though with the drop rate on DST, Madness seems to be the more realistic option</div>

		<div id="post_message_650746">Hi, I play a rogue and I have a few questions in reguards to windfury and swing timers.<br>
<br>
I looked through the Original post however I didn't see anything mentioned about swing timer resets due to windfury, so I'm curious if this still happens.<br>
<br>
I know that there is a large difference between the way windfury on a shaman's weapon works, and windfury totem works. The shaman windfury lands as a yellow attack in the combat log and is incapable of a glancing blow, however, the proc'd extra attack from the windfury totem just says "You hit _____ for x damage." This is a white damage attack which IS capable of glancing blows. Other than the attack power buff you momentarily gain, the mechanics of this attack are more similar to sword specialization than to the actual shaman windfury weapon attacks.<br>
<br>
Now a little while back sword specialization was changed to a yellow attack in the combat log, which meant two things:<br>
1. It would no longer yield glancing blows<br>
2. It reset the swing timer on the mainhand sword <br>
<br>
They decided that it was too much of a buff and they reverted it back to the original mechanic of adding a white attack and NOT reseting the swing timer.<br>
<br>
Anyways, my question is does the shaman windfury weapon proc reset the swing timer on whichever hand proc's it? That was my understanding, just looking for some clarification.<br>
<br>
Thank you,<br>

Well, if gear check is too complicated a toggle of a sort should be sufficient. Maybe even player set value in case we get more SS modifiers in future. Something like /dqd SStimer 9 to set it 9 seconds for example. Of course not sure if such not possible yet.</div>

Since no-glancing-blows meant that the sword spec procs not only did more base damage, but also yielded more crits (though i could be wrong on that one since I don't remember if the procs used a 1 or 2 roll system), and only delayed the next MH by some fraction of its swing timer, the difference worked out to be a bigger buff to sword spec than Blizz intended.</div>

</div>Possible? definitely.  Easy?  Given some of my coding decisions earlier - not so much ;-)<br>
<br>
I really like the fact that the bars all reduce width at the same rate, so you don't have to guess which one is going to run out when, relative to the others.  In the ugly but really quick "fix" I posted above, I think the bar would indeed run for 9 seconds and be done (not sure, but I think so).  It would, however, do so at a different rate than the other bars.<br>
<br>
Since it's only an 11% difference in rate, it's not a huge thing, especially if you can mentally correct for it a little bit, but it doesn't please me to have garbage code and/or presentation out there.  I posted the quick version above because a couple people have asked for it over the months, and I feel bad for saying nothing yet.  So this is a "something is better than nothing" hack, assuming it works.</div>

		<div id="post_message_658041"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I'm not sure how I feel about the SR change. On a fight where you're in no danger of getting forced out of melee it's a nerf. It's 15 fewer seconds of free mana and it makes your returns more random. A very good result will be wasted - you'll be topped off and unable to spend mana fast enough - but a very bad result will suck just as much as ever. On the other hand, if you sync your SR with Bloodlust Brooch/Zerker's Call you'll get better results now - 100% trinket uptime unstead of 66% - and it'll be easier to get a full SR off on add fights or bosses that force you out of melee. It's easier to find a 15-second window than a 30-second one.<br>

</div>No.  It's just oversimplified.  Exec/Mongoose CAN be better than Mongoose/Mongoose, if you've got the gear to make Executioner worth while (that is to say, a good deal of armor pen &amp; AP and a high enough crit rating that an extra 4.8% crit now and then isn't a big deal).  Your raid debuffs are important, too...if you're not getting CoR, Faerie Fire and a full stack of sunders, Exec won't be as good.<br>
<br>
For most shaman not at T6, Mongoose/Mongoose is slightly better.<br>
<br>
I have Exec/Mongoose; I picked it up the first week ZA was out.  It was expensive and I won't be replacing it -- Mongoose/Mongoose isn't that much better (I sim about a 3 dps difference).  When I upgrade Dragonmaw (which will be tonight if the Vortexes drop), I will be putting Mongoose on it.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Well, it depends on who you ask, if you just look at the damage meters, it wont say that it's you're damage since it can't seperate your totem from any other shaman's totem. But if you hadn't been there dropping that totem, there wouldn't be some 40 dps on the boss for almost no effort. <br>
<br>
So no, it wont show (unless someone know that you're the only one using searing totem &amp; merging it to you on WWS) but it's still you're damage.<br>

				This is interesting as i was just about to make a post about this.<br>
<br>
I've noticed recently that with Double Mongoose Procs, Flurry, and a rogue popping Drums of Battle, or me using Bloodlust my weapon speed drops perilously close to 1.5.<br>
<br>
If i use BL whilst the drums are up it goes below 1.5 So atm i am waiting for the drums to run out before using BL. I never use my Haste pots anymore, and am wondering whether to either get Executioner enchanted in the offhand, even though i don't have all that much armour penetration, and whether to use Insane Strengths instead of Haste Pots, as like i said i'm very close to dropping below 1.5 weapon speed in my offhand (Not a prob for Main as it's Syphon with 2.8 speed)

	</tr>
	</table>
</div>I think there is some misunderstanding here.<br>
Haste potions will ALWAYS increase you dps, and they will do even more so when you are on BL, as will drums.<br>

</div>this is EJ, it's not really important if you NOTICE an increase, just whether it is there.<br>
<br>
To build my post around drums and haste potions probably wasn't a good idea, so i will try a different approach.<br>
<br>
<br>
Image you were to face Brutallus (6 minute fight) and you had to choose which bracers to wear.<br>
Now imagine without bracers you had enough passive haste (around 15% i think) that your Mainhand will be just above 1.5 under the following conditions:<br>
<br>
- you have Flurry<br>
- you have BL/Hero up<br>
<br>
Now let us assume I were to choose between the following two items:<br>

<br>
In my last post I calculated that I would loose 22 dps for the duration of time, that I spend below 1.5.<br>
Now let's see what happens if I choose <a onclick="urchinTracker ('/external/http_www_wowhead_com_item_32574');" class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080412023445/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=32574" target="_blank">[Bindings of Lightning Reflexes]</a>.<br>
<br>
- I gain 142.25 AEP which should be around 49.7 DPS for the whole duration of the fight<br>
- I loose 22 dps for 40s/360s = 11% of the fight which equals a loss of 2.44 DPS over the whole fight<br>
<br>
We see that considering the loss we actually only gain 47.26 DPS which is 135.33 AEP which is LESS than we gain from<br>

</div>So, essentially what you're saying is I shouldn't worry about dropping below 1.5 if it is via the useage of Haste Pots, BL, drums, or mongoose procs, but that i shouldn't take haste gear (which i don't anyway).<br>
<br>
I ran Yo!'s sim for 5000 hours with my stats and with my gear the EP values came back as haste being worth 1.96 and hit and crit at 1.97 with ofc strength at 2.2 and expertise being 3.53 or something. <br>
<br>
I know what i'm aiming for in Sunwell, and the new T6 pieces do have some haste rating on them. According to Yo!'s the haste rating is worth alot of EP atm, but as you just mentioned actually some pieces with haste can result in a loss of dps. So should a trade off be made? If i get the T6 pieces with haste on for example, should i lose some haste elsewhere by saying for example losing a mongoose for an executioner, to minimise the time spent at under 1.5 speed?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
First, the raid leader said he wanted the paladin in our group because of aura, in this particular case Concentration Aura (gives a 35% chance of ignoring spell interruption when damaged to all party members within 30 yards). I'm not sure if this was the best aura to use for this group, but puttin that aside which is best: 1) a paladin using an aura appropriate for a melee group; or 2) substituting the paladin with aonther melee dps who can make better use of Windfury totem?<br>
<br>
Second, one of the rogues had poisons on his daggers. We were trying to figure out why he wasn't getting any Windfury procs and finally figured that out. Does anyone have a good comparison of rogues using poisons versus utilizing Windfury?<br>

Does seem you are keeping GoA down for longer than it should be? Depends what rotation you use for twisting but generally twisting AND waiting to use SS doesn't work that well, you end up with either delaying twisting (WF drops off of party) or delaying SS to after twisting and wasting even more time.</div>

		<div id="post_message_660745">I'm having an issue with my guild's raid policy where I'm not being allowed to have top priority for rolling on leather items. The current policy is that top priority goes to those classes whose best (in terms of protection) armor is what is being rolled for. So in my case, rogues have priority over me for leather items despite those items being significant upgrades to my dps.<br>
<br>
I've tried explaining the concepts in this thread, particularly those dealing with emphasizing dps on gear without consideration of armor type. I questioned this initially but it obviously makes sense that armor doesn't come into play 99% of the time and only when we take too much threat (a mistake) or the tank is down (in which case we're going to wipe most the time anyway). Sure there's the occasional fight where the threat table comes into play for the occasional attack  but I've committed (mentally as well as badges and lots of gold) to the concept of maximizing dps as the only deciding factor in gear selection.<br>
<br>
How have others dealt with this type of policy? Any recommendations on what can be said to the officers in question to get them to understand this point?<br>
<br>
This is very frustrating as I like the guild a lot, we're starting to get into 25-mans, but to me this is a deciding factor. I don't see the point in staying with a raiding guild if they don't both understand this concept and have a loot policy that is consistent with it. Am I off base here?<br>

		<div id="post_message_660753">It is your own guilds perogative about what gear you can take.  Yes you are melee.  But while leather is the best for you, you do have the option to wear hunter mail.  Some of which is not terrible.<br>
<br>
In my guild, I just used primarily mail items until we finally finished all progression content.  Because for progression I personally believe a rogue will get a lot more use out of a leather item than I will.  Now that we are done with progression for the time being, I am picking up leather gear pissing off our newer rogues... Its all about how your guild treats you and how you want to play your role within the raid.  <br>
<br>
If your own personal DPS isnt terrible to begin with then does it really matter where the Armor piece goes as long as that person is an active raider?  At least, thats my view on it.<br>
<br>
@McCloud - Your tank is full of shit.  WF totem can proc for anyone in the group whenever, as long as they have the imbue applied.</div>

If you're likely to pick up an upgrade that's fairly close to "best in slot" that you'll be able to use and the rogues won't, grab that rather than going for the leather item (unless none of the rogues are after it). More upgrades for everyone, and you don't piss people off.</div>

I have the same right to take an item if its an upgrade for me. I mean I make the tier 6 people happy cause I dont take tier 6 items, why shouldnt I be allowed to take what's best in slot for me? That's just stupid especially when I have a perfect attendance and I do very high dps compared to many other people in the guild.<br>
<br>
If my guild treated me like that Amagnus I would try to find a new home. Cause then an enhancement shaman should never take an upgrade cause the most gear current ingame are "rogue and hunter loot". It's your time man, your DKP.</div>

What's your state of progression? Do you think you can reach illidan in time and every rogue can get a tier 6 chest? If not, don't grab. It's not worth the guild drama. You rogues can get nothing else and their only job is dealing damage. If your hybrid support chars like enhance shaman, elemental shaman, feral cats or shadow priests beat your main damage dealer on meters, it might be skill... but it might be true, that you grabbed all the gear on the road. I was allways en par or on top of our melees, but with the better gear of everyone i'm now in the top 10 at last. And that's the way it should be. Every main damage dealer behind us should be dead or occupied with something else.<br>
<br>
I have knewn that we reach illidan in time and our rogues will throw away all pieces immideately after they get their hands on tier 6. So i didn't worry and got my few leather pieces i want.<br>
But, let them get their bracer/boots/waist first was for us the better advice, i used the badges and later mail stuff until noone else really needed it.<br>
<br>
Amangus is in early tier 5/late tier 4 i guess, so taking two pieces tier 4 and all the karazhan loot he desire shouldn't be a problem. Adding season 3 chest/head and you have a very decent starting gear.<br>

I was raiding last night.  put in a tank group because they were having threat issues.  This tank proceeded to explain the above to me and decided WF totem was a waste for him.  I've never seen this anywhere on this Holy Grail to our spec.  I'm checking with you before I say anything about it.  I'm 99% certain what he says is false.<br>
<br>
Sorry again if it's been covered, Thankyou.</div>

</div>Well hard to say what he is getting at, I believe the 2ppl reference is about the group setup (otherwise it doesnt make any sense at all) 2 tanks, lock, pala and somethine else most likely so he believes the WF is a waste since only the tanks get it. However since the RL put you in the tank group for Threat I dont see why he is arguing with you, no other totem provide it in the same amount.</div>

So don't worry, without stacking for it (using hittrinkets and gems) you won't ever reach the cap.<br>

4 piece t5 is very strong, but if you can get your hands on ZA loot and all the random pieces around in tier 5 instances, you shouldn't worry about it.</div>

For you to not have T6 and have that much hit sounds like you've either gemmed for some, or have chosen pieces specifically for their hit rating. And no i cba to look at your armoury page.<br>
<br>
The T5 enhancement set doesn't suck at all. It's actually pretty damn good, and the difference between T5 &gt; T6 isn't as big as you may think, especially when they put mp5 on it &gt;.&gt;</div>

</div>That's not really true.  Your hit decreases from most of your gear as you progress further into content, it's just made up randomly by huge chunks on specific pieces.  Remembering back I had quite a bit more hit than I do/did simply because it was included on almost every piece of dungeon gear.<br>
<br>
T5 shoulders are also quite terrible, but the rest of the set isn't bad.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I'm having an issue with my guild's raid policy where I'm not being allowed to have top priority for rolling on leather items. The current policy is that top priority goes to those classes whose best (in terms of protection) armor is what is being rolled for. So in my case, rogues have priority over me for leather items despite those items being significant upgrades to my dps.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</div>I don't know if this helps, but I'll tell you what I told my guild about this.  I've done my research on gear; before I even step foot in an instance, I know what every boss in it drops, what items are upgrades, what items are the best on the list of upgrades, and what I might be able to get elsewhere that would be as good or better.  I don't roll/bid on items that I'm not 100% sure I want.  As an enhancement shaman, I will always be competing with either rogues or hunters.  Period.  It's (generally speaking) one or the other for each individual item.  I can either compete with rogues for the items that are better, or I can compete with hunters for gear that might be best in slot for them, but I will most likely vendor in a week or two once the rogues have the item I really want.<br>
<br>
Since then, I generally pass hunter gear to hunters unless there's none present or the item is best-in-slot for me as well, and compete on leather, instead of the other way around.  It results in less wasted gear, less enchanting/gemming costs on my part, and ultimately better guild DPS.  Your guild just has to trust that you know best when it comes to your gear.  It's generally accepted in my guild that I know itemization better than Blizzard seems to, so it's not really a problem for us.</div>
