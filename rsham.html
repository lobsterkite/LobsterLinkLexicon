<font size="4"><b>Resto Shaman changes in Patch 2.4</b></font><br>
(PVE only)<br>
<ul><li>Global cooldown on dropping totems reduced from 1.5 s to 1 s.</li>
<li>Spell haste on healing gear will be more useful. Spell haste now reduces the global cooldown on spells, down to a minimum of 1 second. This change does not apply to melee and ranged abilities.</li>
<li>Totem UI allows individual totems to be destroyed, and is accessible through the API for macros/mods.<br></li>
<li>Earth Shield: Mana cost reduced roughly in half (450 mana instead of 900 mana), and charges reduced from 10 to 6. Each charge will cost 16.7% less mana to cast but you will have to cast the shield 40% more often.<br></li>
<li>Tremor Totem now pulses every 3 seconds, down from 4 seconds.<br></li>
<li>Archon’s Gavel will be as good (or perhaps better than) <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32500" target="_blank">[Crystal Spire of Karabor]</a>, depending on how many people are below 50% health.<br></li>
<li>You will no longer have to remember to retrain Earth Shield if you respect. Characters will now retain talented spell ranks so when they retalent they do not have to relearn the spells from trainers.<br></li>
<li>Fixing <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33505" target="_blank">[Totem of Living Water]</a>. Unlike all the other relics, this one was being applied after talents and set bonuses. It will not be correctly applied before talents and set bonuses. So, instead of saving 19 mana per Chain Heal (17 mana with Tier 6) you will now save 20 mana.<br>
</li>
</ul><br>
<font size="4"><b>I. Information for Raid Leaders</b></font><br>
<u>Who should I have the shaman heal?</u><br>
Shaman are best at healing multiple targets that are standing near each. Assign them to heal melee or simply keep the entire raid topped off. In a 25-man raid, you should see their chain heal constantly jumping from player to player. <br>
<br>
Shaman can heal a single target, such as the main tank. However, this role is better filled by a priest or paladin. You will want to make sure the shaman puts an Earth Shield on the main tank, another player who will take damage or someone who needs protection against spell interruption.<br>
<br>
<u>Should I let shaman roll on cloth or leather gear?</u><br>
Yes. Sometimes a cloth or leather item is better than the available mail items for a slot. This is particularly true if there is no spirit on the cloth or leather gear. If the cloth or leather gear has spirit, it’s probably of more use to a priest or druid. Staves and off-hands are also more beneficial to priests and druids. If you have a question about a specific item, please send me a private message.<br>
<br>
<u>In which group should I put a resto shaman?</u><br>
<br>
Resto shaman can either boost the DPS of a group or increase mana regeneration. Shaman are also sometimes placed in the main tank group to provide the tank with totems necessary for a particular encounter. <br>
<br>
Where you place the shaman will depend on the other classes in your raid. Here are two good places to put a resto shaman:<br>
<br>
• Shadow priests: While shadow priests boost the mana of a group, they need mana themselves to continue casting. Shadow priests and resto shaman are an ideal combination.<br>
• Melee: The shaman’s windfury totem and Bloodlust/Heroism provide a significant DPS boost to any melee group. Rogues and warriors love having a shaman.<br>
<br>
Here are some other possible groups that will benefit from a resto shaman<br>
• Mages/moonkin: The more mana these classes have, the more DPS they can contribute. The shaman’s mana spring totem, mana tide totem and totem to increase spell damage (Wrath of Air) are useful. In general, warlocks do not need a shaman because their main source of mana is life tapping.<br>
<br>
• Main tank group: In most fights, the main tank does not need a shaman in their group. However, there are a few fights in which the boss does high burst damage such as the Prince in Karazhan or Gurtogg Bloodboil in Black Temple. Even if a tank has 490 defence to avoid critical hits, the boss can still land crushing blows. Critical hits are 200% of normal damage and Crushing blows are 150% of normal damage. The shaman’s Grace of Air totem will increase the ability of a warrior to dodge attacks by 3% and a druid to dodge attacks by 5.24%<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
As a shaman, you bring three important qualities to a raid that no other healing class can top: Chain Heal, Heroism/Bloodlust and Totems. No other class can heal multiple players taking damage like a shaman can. And no other class has as many buffs as a shaman brings to a party.<br>
<br>
1) Be familiar with the fight. Know what happens during each phase and where to stand to avoid taking damage. Know if aggro drops during any transitions and avoid healing for a few seconds at that time. <br>
<br>
2) Know the person you are healing<br>
      Know where the tank is going to be during the fight. It's a weak excuse to say "They were out of line of sight." <br>
      Know the abilities of the mob he is tanking. Does it do steady or burst damage? Does it have any special attacks? How big of a hit is plate going to take?<br>
     Know the abilities of the person you are healing. Is this a protection speced warrior or a DPS warrior wearing his tanking gear? How good is their gear? Inspect them if you haven’t played with them before.<br>
<br>
3) Talk to your fellow healers <br>
    If you are healing the same target(s) as someone else, talk to them and work out a strategy. Decide where each of you will stand and how to maximize your effectiveness. <br>
<br>
4) Find a way to easily monitor the health of everyone in the raid and target them for healing. Many healers like using either Xperl, Grid or Pitbull. <br>
<br>
5) Carry several sets of gear -- +Healing, mp5, haste, stamina and any needed resistance sets (mainly shadow).<br>
   You should not wear the same gear for every fight. Some bosses are short sprints. Others are more like a 10 km run. Sometimes you have a shadow priest in your group. Sometimes the mages get the shadow priest. Sometimes you need a lot of stamina to survive the raid-wide attacks of a boss. A mod such as Item Rack can quickly allow you to switch between gear sets. <br>
<br>
<b>Water Shield</b><br>
This is a tremendous source of mana regeneration. It's important to have it on at all times and refresh it before it expires. Many shaman do not wait until all three charges have been used to refresh. When there is a lull in healing, they take that time to put up 3 new charges since they might expire at a time when you can't spare the global cooldown to refresh the shield.<br>
<br>
I recommend using Shaman Friend to alert you when water shield expires. It has an option to give you an audible warning and you can choose several different sounds. It can also report  a successful purge, interrupt or grounding to party or raid channel<br>
<br>
You can also modify SCT to give an audible alert using these instructions:<br>
<br>
I'd like to share this little line of code that is inserted into 'interface\addons\sct\sct_event_config.lua'<br>
Inside the file there is a line local sct_Event_Config = { Next to that is a custom events list. I replaced 'lightning shield' event since it's usefulness is none to me. The file itself contains pretty clear explanations and examples for custom events so feel free to modify. It gives you warning when Water Shield fades. test.wav is your own to pick. <br>

<b>Chain Heal</b><br>
<br>
1) Chain Heal is the best heal in the game. It's what Prayer of Mending wants to be when it grows up. In many fights, Chain Heal will be 90% of what you cast. <br>
<br>
2) Many shaman downrank Chain Heal to Rank 4 (and sometimes even Rank 3). Rank 4 gets the full benefit of your plus healing since it is learned at level 61 and is not subject to the down ranking penalty. By using Rank 4, you reduce your mana costs by 19% but lose only 10% of your healing power.<br>
<br>
3) If mana is not a problem, don't cancel your chain heal -- even if the person is now at full health. As long as there are others nearby who have taken damage, the heal will jump and still make it worth casting.<br>
<br>
4) It might seem like a waste to use Chain Heal for a single target taking damage but it’s actually more efficient than LHW. Plus, there’s always the chance that someone else in range will take damage and the spell will jump. <br>

</div><b>Cast Times and Latency</b><br>
<br>
You always want to start casting your next heal before the first one finishes casting. This is due to latency – or the time it takes for a command from the client to make a round trip to the server and back. However, if you hit the button too early (i.e. mashing buttons) it will slow you down slightly because the server says, “Spell not ready” and you have to send the request again to the server. To time this perfectly, install a mod such as Quartz. The portion of your cast bar in red represents your latency. As soon as the spell you are currently casting reaches the red zone, you can safely start casting your next spell. This will give maximum casting speed.<br>
<br>
This method works well as long as you have 10-12 frames per second (FPS). If you have 5 FPS, you are only seeing the Quartz bar update every 0.2 seconds. You may be better off “mashing the buttons” in this case. <br>
<br>
<b>Consumables</b><br>
Use either <a class="q1" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=22853" target="_blank">[Flask of Mighty Restoration]</a> or a combination of <a class="q1" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=22825" target="_blank">[Elixir of Healing Power]</a> and <a class="q1" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=22840" target="_blank">[Elixir of Major Mageblood]</a>. The two elixirs are more powerful, giving you 16 mp5 and +50 healing. However, the flask can be more economical if you die a lot.<br>

<br>
<b><font size="4">III. Talent Specs</font></b><br>
<br>
These are the main healing specs for raiding: 8-0-53 (recommended for new content) or 0-12-49 (recommended for farm content, mobility, DPS). You can also spec 0-5-56 and 0-0-61 but they are not recommended.<br>
<br>
<b>0-12-49</b> <br>
You get the ability to cast ghost wolf instantly, plus the improved strength and agility totems to boost the DPS done by Hunters (BM) and feral druids. It will give a group an extra 11.5 agility and an extra 12.9 strength. Cheeky's spreadsheet in the Hunter thread can allow your to calculate exactly how much the group's DPS would increase but if your hunters are doing around 1000 DPS, the improved strength and agility totems would boost the DPS of each hunter by about 10 DPS. A feral druid might gain 15-20 DPS. So if the group's DPS increases by 50 DPS, over a 10-minute fight they would do an extra 30,000 damage. The spec sacrifices nothing in healing. What you lose is survivability (by giving up Nature's Guardian and Elemental Warding). However, if that's not an issue, extra DPS never hurts.<br>
<br>
Here's a sample of the <a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?talent=hZxbdbZEc0tVjoted" target="_blank">0-12-49 spec</a><br>
<br>
<b>8-0-53</b><br>
<br>
This spec is the best for raiding, especially when you are first learning an encounter. The build is designed to reduce the damage taken by fire, frost and nature by 10% while maintaining all the core healing talents. Shaman put 5 points in Concussion and 3 in Elemental Warding.<br>
<br>
Many bosses in SSC, Black Temple and Mount Hyjal do quite a bit of elemental damage to the raid. And let's not forget all the elemental damage in Kara. The less damage you take, the less time and mana you have to spend healing yourself. This also boosts your ability to survive.<br>
<br>
Here is a sample of the <a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?talent=hVcZZEc0tAeoted" target="_blank">8-0-53 spec</a><br>
If you want both Elemental Warding and instant Ghost Wolf here's a <a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?talent=hVcZx0bZEs0tVeotcd" target="_blank">8-7-46 spec</a><br>
If you want both Nature's Guardian and instant Ghost Wolf you can try <a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?talent=hZx0bZEs0tAeoted" target="_blank">0-7-54</a><br>
<br>
<b>0-5-56</b><br>
This is a very common spec but it’s not the strongest use of talent points.<br>
<br>
Five points in Ancestral Knowledge boosts your mana pool by 5%. It sounds like a lot but a closer look shows you get a poor return on the points spent. The extra mana will probably be only enough to cast one extra chain heal. <br>
<br>
Existing mana pool: 10,000<br>
+5%:                       10,500<br>
Boost to mana tide:   120/5 minutes = 2 mp5<br>
<br>
The smaller your mana pool, the less benefit you receive. A shaman with 8,000 mana gains an extra 400 mana and only 1.67 mp5 through Mana Tide.<br>
<br>
Here is a sample of the <a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?talent=hZxZEfotAeoted" target="_blank">0-5-56 spec</a><br>
<br>
<b>0-0-61</b><br>
This spec allows you to pick up nearly every talent in the resto tree. However, 8-0-53 is still the best choice.<br>
<br>
If you raid and PVP, you could try <b>8-7-46</b>. <a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?talent=hVcZx0bZgcctVzsted" target="_blank">Here's a sample</a> You don't have the talent to reduce threat from healing by 15% so be careful at the start of a fight or during transitions if the boss drops aggro. Also, this is not a pure PVP spec. If you want to get a high arena rating, there are probably better ways to spend your talent points.<br>
<br>
<b>So is there ever a reason to spec 0-5-56 or 0-0-61?</b><br>
<br>
Yes, when you're raiding zones that have no raid-wide fire, frost or nature damage. The zone should also have no reason for you to need to move quickly outdoors.<br>
<br>
<b>So where do I spend my 53 or 56 or 61 points?</b><br>
<br>
It’s hard to go wrong putting points into the restoration tree. In fact, the only talent that you want to avoid taking is Nature’s Guidance, which increases your chance to hit with melee attacks and spells. You are healing so hitting your target is not an issue. This talent is valuable for resto shaman in PVP to avoid players resisting your Earth Shock. It's also a great talent for Enhancement shaman. <br>
<br>
These are considered must-have talents for raiding: Improved Healing Wave, Tidal Focus, Ancestral Healing, Healing Focus, Totemic Mastery, Healing Grace, Restorative Totems, Healing Way, Nature’s Swiftness, Purification, Mana Tide Totem, Nature’s Blessing, Improved Chain Heal, Earth Shield.<br>
<br>
<b>Where do I put the rest?</b><br>
<br>
<u>Nature’s Guardian</u>: If you take damage that brings you below 30% health, then there is a 50% chance of being healed for 10% of your total health immediately after taking the hit. It heals you after the damage from the hit is applied, so if the damage takes you to 0%, it doesn't proc. It cannot proc more than once every 5 seconds. Plus, the heal reduces your threat. It’s a must-have talent for resto PVP and highly desirable for shamans who raid.<br>
<br>
<u>Totemic Focus</u>: Reduces the cost of your totems by 25%. It provides a bigger benefit than Ancestral Knowledge. At worst, it will probably equate to giving you an extra 4.6 mp5 (Scenario 1). At best, it could give you the equivalent of 16.5 mp5 (Scenario 2).<br>
<br>
Scenario 1: You are in a caster group dropping Mana Spring and Wrath of Air. You drop your totems every 2 minutes.<br>
Mana Spring: 120 mana<br>
Wrath: 320 mana<br>
Total: 2,200 mana during a 10 minute fight. The talent would save you 550 mana or 4.6 mp5<br>
<br>
Scenario 2: You are in a melee group dropping Windfury, Strength of Earth, Healing stream and Searing Totem. You drop your totems every 1.5 minutes, or 7 times during the fight.<br>
<br>
Windfury: 325 mana (2275)<br>
Strength: 300 mana (2100)<br>
Healing: 95 mana (665)<br>
Searing: 205 mana x 2 (2870)<br>
Total: 7,910 mana during a 10 minute fight. The talent would save you 1,977.5 mana or 16.5 mp5 <br>
<br>
<u>Improved Reincarnation</u>: Many shaman swear by this talent but I think there are better uses of talent points. Instead of popping with 20% health and mana, you can pop with 40%. It also reduces the cooldown on your Reincarnation from an hour to 40 minutes. <br>
<br>
There are a few fights were dying is unavoidable and it’s very handy to have a shaman pop (especially with extra health and mana). For example, if you get the Doomguard debuff during the Azgalor fight or if Teron Gorefiend chooses you for Shadow of Death.<br>
<br>
However, on most fights you should not die. And if you do die, there are probably several things going wrong with the raid and you resurrecting will not fix them before everyone wipes.<br>
<br>
<u>Focused Mind</u>: Generally seen as a weak talent for raiding since most bosses do not silence. It is often sacrified in the 8-0-53 and 0-5-56 builds. However, you can easily include it in a 0-0-61 build. A must-have talent for shaman who also PVP.<br>
<br>
<u>Tidal Mastery</u>: This talent goes hand-in-hand with Ancestral Healing, which you absolutely should have. The 25% increase in armor from Ancestral Healing typically will give more protection than an Ironshield potion. Plus, the proc scales as your tank gets better gear. In addition, with multiple shamans in the raid, and each having 5% more crit, the chances of getting an Ancestral Healing proc rise a great deal.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
<b>Set Bonuses</b><br>
<br>
Tier 4: You want two pieces. The bonus boosts your mana spring totem by 7.5 mp5, which benefits you and your entire party. Don’t worry about the four-piece bonus.<br>
<br>
Tier 5: Bonuses are nothing great. <br>
<br>
Tier 6: You want four pieces. The set bonuses are fantastic. It doesn't matter what stats another piece of gear has, you are always better off with the set bonuses.<br>
<br>
The two-piece bonus is worth 64 mp5 assuming you cast 15 chain heals per minute. If you cast 20 chain heals (3 seconds per CH), it's worth 85.5 mp5.<br>
<br>
The four-piece bonus is worth 82 healing (from the base spell) plus 0.06675 per point of +heal.<br>
according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080405144643/http://dashboard.filefront.com/Binkenstein/" target="_blank">Shamstats</a> by Binkenstein. If you had 2000 +healing, your chain heal on three targets would gain an extra 216 healing.<br>
<br>
Best pieces to wear: Bracers, Belt, Boots and Helmet/Shoulders <br>
<br>
There are better non-set options for the chest, gloves and legs. The first pieces of T6 that most people get are the gloves (Azgalor) and the helm (Archimonde). <br>
<br>
<br>
<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32500" target="_blank">[Crystal Spire of Karabor]</a><br>
The proc on this mace makes it one of the best, if not THE best, healing mace in the game. <br>
<br>
<i>If your target is below 50% health, your direct healing spells will cause your target to be healed for an additional 180 to 220 health.</i><br>
<ul><li>The proc is not affected by +healing.</li>
<li>It will proc off each jump of Chain Heal.</li>
<li>The proc can crit.</li>
<li>It will proc off Earth Shield cast on yourself and Nature's Guardian.</li>
</ul><b>Stat Weights</b><br>
<br>
Arriving at standard weights for stats is much more difficult for a healing class than a DPS class. In some fights, you may be assigned to heal a single target. In other fights, you may be healing the entire raid. Some fights may last 2 minutes, while others go on for more than 20 minutes. Plus, your needs change as you get better gear. Once you get a sufficient amount of mana and mana regen, other stats will take on more importance.<br>
<br>
Haste is a hotly debated stat for both resto shaman and virtually all other classes. It can significantly boost your healing but at the cost of mana regen and other stats. Its value may also fluctuate depending on how often you are casting back-to-back heals in a fight. <br>
<br>
To generate a list of gear using the rankings, I recommend <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080405144643/http://www.lootrank.com/" target="_blank">Loot Rank</a>. Be sure to enter the meta gem value or it will use the Bracing Earthstorm. To display these values in-game, try a mod such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080405144643/http://pawnmod.trenchrats.com/index.php" target="_blank">Pawn</a>. <br>
<br>
For more control over gear rankings (such as playing with different gems and set bonuses), I highly recommend <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080405144643/http://hosted.filefront.com/Binkenstein" target="_blank">Binkenstein’s Shamstats</a>. <u>Shaman are also encouraged to customize their own stat weights. </u>Treat the values below as a starting point, not the final answer on how to rank gear. These numbers were not carved into stone tablets on Mount Sinai. When customizing your own stat weights, it is not necessary to use every single stat listed below. <br>

	</tbody></table>
</div><b>Relics</b><br>
<br>
They come to two varieties: Ones that reduce the mana cost of your healing spells and one that increase your +healing for a specific type of healing spell. There is also <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=24413" target="_blank">[Totem of the Thunderhead]</a>. However, your water shield will not continue to get a boost if you switch to another relic after casting it.<br>
<br>
The amount added to healing from relics is applied the same way +healing is applied to your spells. Relics are applied before set bonuses.<br>
<br>
<u>Chain Heal</u><br>
<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28523" target="_blank">[Totem of Healing Rains]</a><br>
<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33505" target="_blank">[Totem of Living Water]</a><br>
<br>
Use the Totem of Healing Rains if mana is not an issue.<br>
<br>
Each Chain Heal you cast per minute with Totem of Living Water equipped equals 1.67 mp5 (20/12=1.6667) so if you do:<br>
<br>
10 casts per minute you get 16.67 mp5 <br>
15 casts per minute 25 mp5<br>
20 casts per minute 33.33 mp5 (pretty much the upper limit without haste gear)<br>
<br>
<u>Healing Wave</u><br>
<a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=27544" target="_blank">[Totem of Spontaneous Regrowth]</a><br>
<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30023" target="_blank">[Totem of the Maelstrom]</a>  <br>
<br>
Each Healing Wave you cast per minute with Totem of the Maelstrom equipped equals 2 mp5 (24/12=2) so if you do:<br>
<br>
10 casts per minute you get 20 mp5 <br>
15 casts per minute 30 mp5<br>
20 casts per minute 40 mp5 (pretty much the upper limit without haste gear)<br>
<br>
<u>LHW</u><br>
<a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=25645" target="_blank">[Totem of the Plains]</a><br>

<br>
<b>Spell Hit</b><br>
Normally, resto shamans don’t worry about spell hit. However, there are a few fights in which we may be asked to not only heal but interrupt spells cast by a boss. In these situations, it can be helpful to boost your +hit to cut down on the number of resists you will get. My favorite way is to get a pair of gloves with spell hit, gem them for spell hit and then enchant them for spell hit. You maximize your hit but at the sacrifice of only one piece of normal healing gear.<br>
<br>
You may be asked to Earth Shock Hellfire Channelers (72) in Magtheridon, Shade of Aran (73), Kael’thas (73), or the priest (72) in the Karathress fight.<br>
<br>
There is a 1% chance to miss against any target, no matter how much spell hit you have through gear or talents. Here is how much spell hit you need to become “hit capped,” meaning you have a 99% chance to hit the target.<br>
<br>
Target     Spell Hit needed<br>
Level 70     3%<br>
Level 71     4%<br>
Level 72     5%<br>
Level 73     16% (Boss level)<br>
<br>
<u>Talents</u><br>
Draenei can get 1% spell hit from Inspiring Presence<br>
<br>
<u>Gear</u><br>
<a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=24450" target="_blank">[Manaspark Gloves]</a> are easy to farm from the first boss in normal Underbog (Hungarfen)<br>
Put a <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=31861" target="_blank">[Great Dawnstone]</a> in each socket and enchant with Spell Strike (15 hit rating) and you have a total of 46 spell hit (3.65%). This is quite a bit of spell hit on one piece of gear.<br>
<br>
Another option is <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28507" target="_blank">[Handwraps of Flowing Thought]</a> from Attuneman in Kara, which will give 45 spell hit (3.57%) but have better stats.<br>
<br>
<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30725" target="_blank">[Anger-Spark Gloves]</a> will give you 51 spell hit (4.04%) but are a bit difficult to get if you don’t regularly kill Doomwalker.<br>
<br>
The absolutely best option is to get the Tier 6 Elemental gloves <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=31008" target="_blank">[Skyshatter Gauntlets]</a> and socket them with a <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32210" target="_blank">[Great Lionseye]</a>. You will have 44 spell hit rating (3.49%) plus a decent amount of +healing, stamina, intellect and spell crit.<br>
<br>
<b>Using Tier 2</b><br>
<br>
One surprising way to boost your healing is to wear three pieces of Tier 2. Yes, the stuff that drops from Onyxia and in Black Wing Lair. The increased healing has been confirmed both by theoretical models and by actual experimentation in raids. Wearing three pieces of Tier 2 (3T2) can boost your effective chain healing by 10% to 15%. The more +healing you have, the better the set bonus becomes because it is percentage based.<br>
<br>
The bonus is “increases the amount healed by Chain Heal to targets beyond the first by 30%.” What makes this such an incredible bonus is the fact that the third jump gets the set bonus that is applied to the second jump.<br>
<br>
Let’s assume the first jump of chain heals for 1,000. With the set bonus, the second jump heals for 650 and the third for 422.5. Without the set bonus, the second jump heals for 500 and the third for 250.<br>
<br>
While you have less +healing, your chain heal becomes more powerful due to the set bonus. If we assume no overhealing, your chain heal does roughly 10% more healing if it hits three targets on average. However, most overhealing is done on the first target (which other healers are targeting). Because your second and third jumps heal for a larger amount (and jump instantly to those who have taken damage), you actually become a more effective healer – boosting the effect of the set bonus to roughly 15%.<br>
<br>
You should wear three pieces of Tier 2 if the following statements are true:<br>
• Chain heal will be 90% or more of your healing for the fight.<br>
• Your chain heal will hit all 3 targets. <br>
• You are in a 25-man raid<br>
• You do not lose any Tier 6 bonuses by equipping Tier 2. Tier 4 and Tier 5 set bonuses do not matter.<br>
<br>
The best pieces of T2 to use are:<br>
<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=16943" target="_blank">[Bracers of Ten Storms]</a><br>
<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=16949" target="_blank">[Greaves of Ten Storms]</a><br>
<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=16944" target="_blank">[Belt of Ten Storms]</a><br>
<br>
What you lose (varies depending on current gear and which pieces of T2 you equip):<br>
• Healing -200 to -350<br>
• Crit -1% to -2%<br>
• Intellect -15 to -35<br>
• Stamina -25 to -80<br>
• Mp5 -20 to -50<br>
<br>
The loss of crit and Intellect is negligible. Depending on how much stamina or mp5 you lose, you may need to use adjust other gear or the make-up of your group or use more potions. However, you can wear 3T2 even on fights that require high stamina such as Naj’entus. <br>
<br>
Here’s the math (credit goes to Thud00 and Daidalos):<br>
<br>
In a regular chain heal you have X + (0.50*X) + (0.50*0.50*X) where X is the base healing on the first target or       <br>
                                              X + 0.50X + 0.25X = 1.75X<br>
<br>
With 3T2 you have X + (0.65*X) + (0.65*0.65*X) where <br>
                            or X + 0.65X + 0.4225X= 2.0725X<br>
<br>
So including talents and plus healing, <br>
<br>
<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px; ">

				Without 3T2:<br>
(884 + 87 + 2000 * (2.5/3.5)) * 1.1 * 1.2 *1.05 * 1.75 = 5820<br>
<br>
(base + maiden trinket + heal * cast time) * purification * improved ch * t6 bonus * 2 jumps<br>
<br>
With 3T2 (assuming you lose +250 healing)<br>
<br>
(884 + 87 + 1750 * (2.5/3.5)) * 1.1 * 1.2 * 1.05 * 2.0725 = 6380
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>Clearly you get more heal wearing 3T2, 9.6% more.<br>
<br>
Thud00 wrote a custom mod to measure overhealing on a per jump basis. He found overhealing on the initial jump was about 50%, while overhealing on subsequent jumps was about 20%. This makes sense given that multiple healers will often target the same person who has taken damage. The beauty of chain heal is that it instantly jumps to two other people. They often take damage while you were casting so a chain heal or prayer of mending is the first thing to land – resulting in less overhealing.<br>
<br>
Taking overhealing into account the 1.75 becomes 1*0.5 + 0.75*0.8 = 1.1<br>
and the 2.0725 figure becomes 1*0.5 + 1.0725*0.8 = 1.358<br>
<br>
This takes the effective healing to:<br>
<br>
<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px">
	<div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom:0px"><img src="assets/code_html.gif" border="0"></div>
	<pre class="alt2" dir="ltr" style="

(884 + 87 + 2000 * (2.5/3.5)) * 1.1 * 1.2 *1.05 * 1.1 = 3658

With 3T2
(884 + 87 + 1750 * (2.5/3.5)) * 1.1 * 1.2 * 1.05 * 2.0725 = 4180</pre>
</div>So the real effect of 3TS is around 14.3% more healing. In this example, you would need 2479 +heal to get the same effective heal without the 3T2 bonus so it’s worth about 729 +heal .<br>
<br>
<b><font size="4">V. Haste </font></b><br>
<br>
A large amount of healing gear with spell haste is available in Hyjal, Black Temple, ZA and Sunwell. And like with many other aspects of healing, its value is all in knowing when to wear it.<br>
<br>
If your mana bar isn’t moving much, it’s time to put on gear with spell haste. However, spell haste does you no good if it makes you go OOM.<br>
<br>
Many shaman find that when put in a group with a shadow priest, they cannot use their mana fast enough. Often, our mana bar will never drop below 50% due to the shadow priest, water shield, mana spring and other buffs. Many shaman also wear haste gear on trash since they can drink after each pull.<br>
<br>
By wearing gear with spell haste, we can cast spells faster, boosting our overall healing done for a fight – and potentially have heals landing faster to prevent deaths.<br>
<br>
Starting in Patch 2.4, spell haste lowers global cooldown on spells, reducing the GCD to as little as 1 second. <br>
<br>
<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px">
	<div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom:0px"><img src="assets/code_html.gif" border="0"></div>
	<pre class="alt2" dir="ltr" style="

		width: 694px;

		text-align: left;
		overflow: auto">1% Spell Haste = 15.76 Haste Rating</pre>
</div>1% haste means you will cast 1 additional spell in the time it would normally take to cast 100 spells. You do NOT cast 1% faster. <br>
<br>
Spell Haste is calculated after talents. So if Healing Wave is 3.0 seconds normally and talents reduce it to 2.5 seconds, then 10% haste (157 haste rating) would reduce the cast time to 2.275 seconds. <br>
<br>
Spell Haste can reduce the global cooldown but it cannot reduce it below 1.0 seconds.<br>
<br>
Here are some formulas to calculate Spell Haste and its effects<br>
<br>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080405144643im_/http://elitistjerks.com/cgi-bin/mathtex.cgi?\text{ New Cast Time } = \frac{OldCastTime}{1 + (Haste Rating/1576)}" alt="\text{ New Cast Time } = \frac{OldCastTime}{1 + (Haste Rating/1576)}"><br>

<br>
<br>
<u>No amount of haste including Bloodlust/Heroism will lower the global cooldown below 1 second.</u><br>
This can be proven using the following UI hook and spamming an instant spell with no cooldown inside and outside of Bloodlust: <br>
<br>
<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px; ">

<br>
With the gear currently in the game, you don't have to worry about your cast times bumping up against the global cooldown (unless you are using Bloodlust/Heroism). <br>
<br>
To lower the cast time of Chain Heal and Healing Wave to 1 second, you would need 2,364 haste rating (or 1,455 with Bloodlust/Heroism). To lower the cast time of Lesser Healing Wave to 1 second, you would need 788 haste rating (243 haste with Bloodlust/Heroism).<br>

<br>
Enchanting your gear can quickly drain your bank account. However, it is well worth the expense if you will not upgrade your gear for a while. There are also a few "cheap" enchants that are worth putting on your gear even if you won't have it long: +6 mp5 to chest, Vitality for boots and the honored shoulder enchants. The best enchant to skip all together if money is an issue is Subtlety to cloak.<br>
<br>
Gems can also be a major investment. It's ok to use green-quality gems as you level up and gear up. However, never leave a socket empty. Always put some gem in it. <br>
<br>
Resto shaman should primarily use + healing gems in sockets, often ignoring socket bonuses. Gems with spell haste can be another viable option. Blue gems should be used sparingly.<br>
<br>
<font size="3"><br>
RED:</font> <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=24029" target="_blank">[Teardrop Living Ruby]</a> or <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32195" target="_blank">[Teardrop Crimson Spinel]</a>  <br>

<br>
<font size="3">YELLOW:</font> <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=35315" target="_blank">[Quick Dawnstone]</a> or <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=35761" target="_blank">[Quick Lionseye]</a>. Before Patch 2.4, your best option was <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=24060" target="_blank">[Luminous Noble Topaz]</a> or <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32219" target="_blank">[Luminous Pyrestone]</a>. However, the spell haste gems can be just as good as +healing gems.<br>
<br>
<b>Meta Socket </b><br>
<br>
Unlike DPS classes, there is no great meta gem for healers. <br>
<br>
<a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=25901" target="_blank">[Insightful Earthstorm Diamond]</a> (Recommended)<br>
<br>
It procs off any spell cast, including totems and water shield. You then gain 300 mana from “Mana Restore.” The tooltip says it has a 2% chance to proc. However, both Wowhead and Thotbot list the proc rate as 5% and WWS data from raids would indicate that the proc rate is higher than 2%. There is no cooldown. On rare occasions, it has procced off itself.<br>
<br>
In real raid situations using mainly Chain Heal, it returns about 20 mp5 (which would be roughly a 4% proc rate). Shaman may get more procs off the meta gem than others healers due to the fact that we are constantly dropping totems and casting water shield -- all of which can proc the gem.<br>
<br>
Assuming it takes 3.0 seconds to cast Chain Heal given reaction time and lag, here are the mp5 values for various proc rates:<br>
<br>
2% = (300 mana / (50 casts * 3.0secPerCast)) * 5 seconds = 10 mp5<br>
4% = (300 mana / (25 casts * 3.0secPerCast)) * 5 seconds = 20 mp5<br>
5% = (300 mana / (20 casts * 3.0secPerCast)) * 5 seconds = 25 mp5<br>
<br>
The meta requires that you have 2 red gems, 2 yellow gems and 2 blue gems. The two red gems should not be a problem for any shaman. You can meet the rest of the requirement with Luminous Noble Topaz x2. Secondary colors (purple, orange, green) count for BOTH primary colors.<br>
<br>
However, orange gems are no longer the best choice for shaman with the introduction in Patch 2.4 of yellow gems with spell haste rating. This could make the meta gem requirements more difficult to obtain. <br>
<br>
<a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=25897" target="_blank">[Bracing Earthstorm Diamond]</a><br>
This has the easiest gem requirement to meet -- more red gems than blue gems. If you can't easily meet the requirements of the Insightful Earthstorm Diamond, use this meta gem. <br>
<br>
In Patch 2.3.2, the requirement of having more yellow gems than blue gems was eliminated.<br>
<br>
<a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=25893" target="_blank">[Mystical Skyfire Diamond]</a><br>
<br>
The gem has a 15% chance to proc and it will proc off anything, including totems and water shield. When it procs you gain 320 spell haste rating for 6 seconds. There is a 45-second cooldown since Patch 2.3. In real raid situations it will proc about once per minute.<br>
<br>
If you're lucky, you get off one super fast heal. However, the proc can also be wasted if it occurs at the end of the fight or when no one needs healing. The proc from Insightful Earthstorm (extra mana) will not go to waste as long as you are below 100% mana.<br>
<br>
This meta gem has a second drawback -- it requires more blue gems than yellow. Currently, the best gems for resto shaman are red and yellow. Blue gives us the least benefit. The gem might have some benefit if put in a secondary (or duplicate helm) and used as part of a spell haste set. However, yellow gems give spell haste so the meta might work against gems in haste gear.<br>
<br>
<b><font size="4">VII. Enchants</font></b><br>
<br>
<b>Weapon:</b> Major healing +81 healing (Recommended) <br>
Spellsurge (3% chance on spellcast to restore 100 mana to all party members over 10 seconds). In actual raids, this works out to about 6-8 mp5 per person. <br>
NOTE: I recommend putting +81 healing on your best healing mace and then putting Spell Surge on another mace. Use a mod such as Caster Weapon Swapper to switch between them while Spell Surge is on cooldown.<br>
<br>
<b>Shield:</b> Intellect (+12 int) or Major Stamina (+18 stam)<br>

NOTE: Shaman just starting out my prefer Vitality ( 4 mp5 &amp; 4 health/5). Also Vitality is a much cheaper and easier to find so it may be the best enchant if you expect to quickly upgrade your boots.<br>
<br>
<b>Rings:</b> Ring enchants are only available to enchanters. Your best choice is +20 healing.<br>

<br>
How to calculate the value of on-use trinkets:<br>
<br>
Take the amount of additional healing and multiple by the duration of the buff. Then divide by the cooldown. Let’s use <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=29376" target="_blank">[Essence of the Martyr]</a> as an example<br>
<br>
297*20/120 = 49.5 healing<br>
<br>
I find it extremely difficult to remember to click on-use trinkets. Therefore, I create a macro to use the +healing trinkets each time I cast Earth Shield. This ensures I use them every 2-3 minutes.<br>
<br>
Please note that some trinkets are listed in more than one category<br>
<br>
<u>Best of the Best</u><br>
<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=35750" target="_blank">[Redeemer's Alchemist Stone]</a><br>
Equip: Increases healing by 119 and damage by 40 <br>
Equip: Increases the effect that healing and mana potions have on the wearer by 40%. <br>
<br>
A super mana pot, on average, restores 2400 mana. The Alchemist Stone boosts the mana returned by 40% or 960 mana. That's an extra 40 mp5 if you're chain chugging pots. If you drink 1-2 super mana pots during a 10-minute fight, it would restore, 8 mp5 to 16 mp5. However, the advantage is you get extra mana when you need it the most.<br>
<br>

<br>
<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=34471" target="_blank">[Vial of the Sunwell]</a> <br>
Collects 100 Holy Energy from healing spells you cast. Cannot collect more than 2000 Holy Energy. <br>
Use: Release all accumulated Holy Energy to instantly heal your target by the amount of Holy Energy accumulated <br>
Equip: 15 mp5 <br>
Cooldown: 2 min (Increased on PTR from 1 minute)<br>
<br>
How the trinket works:<br>
1) The max range on the heal is 40 yards.<br>
2) Using the trinket does not trigger the GCD so it's truly a free, extra, instant heal.<br>
3) The stacking Holy Energy buff never fades. It doesn't have a timer. You keep the stacks indefinitely until you use them, even if you change gear, log out or switch zones. The only time you lose the charges is when you zone into the arena. You can spam Healing Wave Rank 1 to quickly charge it to full.<br>
4) Can use while silenced. <br>
5) Casting Earth Shield will not stack the Holy Energy buff.<br>
6) The healing done is increased by Fel Armor and the rogue talent. We assume that Mortal Strike, would poison, etc will decrease healing. <br>
7) It can crit, with a maximum of 3,000 healing done.<br>
8) The healing done by the trinket will activiate the healing proc from Illidan's <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32500" target="_blank">[Crystal Spire of Karabor]</a><br>

   Procs off each jump of chain heal, boosting the proc chance to 6%. If it procs once per minute, it equals 37.5 mp5. It will also proc off Earth Shield charges if you cast it on yourself. You need to make sure that you are in a fight where you are spamming chain heal non-stop. Otherwise, you can easily see the proc rate fall to once every two minutes (18 mp5)<br>

<u>For the “On-Use” Challenged</u><br>
As I said earlier, I highly recommend making a macro that tries to use your trinkets every time you cast Earth Shield. This will boost the healing power of the Earth Shield and ensure you use the trinket every time the cooldown is up. Most shaman cast Earth Shield every 30 seconds to 2 minutes. However, if you won’t listen to good advice, here are some trinkets below that require you to do nothing.<br>

<br>
<b>2. Should I choose Aldor or Scryer?</b><br>
For the purpose of healing, it makes absolutely no difference. What does matter is that you become exalted with that faction so you have access to the best shoulder enchant.<br>
<br>
<b>3. Who should I Earth Shield?</b><br>
<br>
During raids, I have cast my Earth Shield on every single class. Normally, I put it on a tank or off-tank who will take constant damage. However, sometimes the tank is getting so many heals that it’s more effective to use it on another player. And remember it will give casters an additional 30% chance to ignore spell interruption. I often Earth Shield mages and warlocks when they AOE trash. I sometimes use it on a hunter who will be kiting mobs out of range of healers. And sometimes I put it on myself or another healer when we pull aggro on trash.<br>
<br>
Casters: Moonkin, Elemental Shaman and Shadow Priests have no talents to prevent spell pushback, which can sharply reduce their DPS in some fights. They will benefit the most from Earth Shield to boost DPS. Arcane and fire mages have talents to give them 70% resistance. Mages will have 100% spell pushback resistance on frost and fire spells with two pieces of T4. Destruction warlocks have 70% resistance with talents. Elemental shaman with four pieces of Season 3 arena gear (Vengeful Gladiator) get 50% resistance on lightning bolts.<br>
<br>
Tanks: All paladins have a passive ability called Spiritual Attunement that restores mana equal to 10% of the healing they receive. Since Patch 2.1.0, they have received mana back from the healing done by Earth Shield (and Prayer of Mending). Each point of mana restored generates 0.5 threat.<br>
<br>
<b>4. How much +healing and mp5 should I have?</b><br>
<br>
It depends on the make-up of your group. How many healers do you have? How fast do you usually kill a boss? Here are some (unbuffed) ranges:<br>
<br>
Pre-Kara <br>
Health 5000-6000<br>
Mana: 7000-8000<br>
Mp5 while casting: 115-145<br>
Healing: 1200-1500<br>
<br>
Tier 4 <br>
Health: 7000-7800<br>
Mana: 8500-9600<br>
Mp5 while casting: 125-150<br>
Healing: 1750-2000<br>
<br>
Tier 5 <br>
Health: 7500-8200<br>
Mana: 9000-10,000<br>
Mp5: 150-200<br>
Healing: 1900-2100<br>
<br>
Tier 6 <br>
Health: 8500-8700<br>
Mana: 9500-10,500<br>
Mp5: 150-300<br>
Healing: 2000-2300<br>
Haste: 0-200<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>5. Can I make a macro to drop four totems at once?</b><br>
No. You can click one button four times and it will go through a cast sequence and drop four different totems.<br>
<br>
<b>6. Can I make a macro to remove poison and disease with one button?</b><br>
No. You can bind poison to one key and use a modify to make that same key when used with shift, control, alt remove disease (see Macro section).<br>
<br>
<b>7. Do Healing Stream and Mana Stream stack? What about…</b><br>
Healing: Yes<br>
Mana: No<br>
Mana Spring stacks with the Paladin’s Blessing of Wisdom<br>
Tranquil Air stacks with the Paladin’s Blessing of Salvation (total of 44% threat reduction)<br>
Healing Focus' spell interruption protection of 70% stacks with the Paladin's Aura of Concentration (35%) to provide 100% spell pushback protection (105% technically). This is one of the few mechanics in the game that is additive rather than multiplicative.<br>
<br>
<b>8. How do I heal in the arena and battlegrounds?</b><br>
There's a good discussion here: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080405144643/http://elitistjerks.com/f38/t14902-shaman_resto_questions/" target="_blank">[shaman] Resto questions</a><br>
<br>
<b><font size="4">XIII. Healing Theorycraft (Warning: Math Ahead)</font></b><br>
<br>
<b>Chain Heal (CH)</b><br>
This is our signature heal and the one that all the other healing classes wish they had. After healing the initial target, the healing effect will jump to the most damaged target (by absolute health) within range. Each jump reduces the healing done by 50%. The jump range of the spell is approximately 10-15 yards. If there are no targets in range below 100% it will not jump. The heal can jump back to the shaman if they have taken damage.<br>
<br>
Chain heal can crit on any (or all) of the three jumps. However, the healing done to the next target is based on the non-crit healing done. Crits from chain heal will proc Ancestral Fortitude.<br>
<br>
There is a known bug with Chain Heal. If Chain Heal jumps back to you on its first jump (the second heal), it will not jump to a third target. It is sometimes better to target yourself for the first heal to make sure it jumps to two other targets.<br>
<br>
Many trinkets will proc based on a “direct healing spells.” Each jump of chain heal is considered a direct heal. A trinket such as <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30619" target="_blank">[Fel Reaver's Piston]</a> or <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28823" target="_blank">[Eye of Gruul]</a> can proc on any jump of chain heal. However, the Fel Reaver’s heal over time will appear on just one person, not all three.<br>
<br>
Other trinkets proc based on “each spell cast.” In those cases, the jumps do not count as separate spells. For example, <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28727" target="_blank">[Pendant of the Violet Eye]</a><br>
 <br>
In many raids chain heal will represent 50-90% of all your healing.<br>
<br>
It receives the following bonuses from +healing gear:<br>
<br>
71% + 36% + 18% = 125% with no talents<br>
94% + 47% + 24% = 165% with Purification (+10%) and Improved Chain Heal (+20%)<br>
<br>
Many shaman downrank Chain Heal to Rank 4 (and sometimes even Rank 3). Rank 4 gets the full benefit of your plus healing since it is learned at level 61 and is not subject to the down ranking penalty. By using Rank 4, you reduce your mana costs by 19% but lose only 10% of your healing power.<br>
<br>
Downranking is using a lower level of a spell to reduce overhealing and improve mana efficiency. To calculate the downrank penalty:<br>
<br>
     Level at which the next rank is learned +5/70 or<br>
     Level before next spell is learned +6/70<br>
<br>
For spells learned before Level 20 there is an additional penalty:<br>
Penalty = (20-Level Spell is Learned) * 0.0375<br>

NOTE: +1800 Healing with talents and relic<br>
<br>
<b>Healing Wave</b><br>
This is our big heal but it takes 2.5 seconds to cast (3.0 seconds without talents). It receives 86% of our plus healing, which is not reduced by talents to shorten cast time. And by stacking Healing Way we can boost its healing by another 18%. Shaman often start casting this heal and then cancel if the tank is not taking damage<br>
<br>
You can spam Rank 1 to proc Ancestral Fortitude and stack Healing Way either before a pull or during a fight.<br>
<br>
Shaman often use Rank 8 as well as Rank 12.<br>

NOTE: +1800 Healing with talents. HW=Healing Way<br>
<br>
<b>Lesser Healing Wave (LHW)</b><br>
Many shaman make the mistake of making LHW their primary heal. However, it has a high mana cost and gets little benefit from your healing gear (only 43%). It also doesn’t stack Healing Way. You are not a Paladin and LHW is not Flash of Light. <br>
<br>
It’s best used when time is of the essence and you don’t have an extra second to cast Chain Heal or Healing Wave. Tauren shaman often war stomp and then cast LHW. Shamans do not typically downrank this spell.<br>

<br>
<b>Earth Shield</b><br>
<br>
Many consider this the shaman’s version of a heal over time. It will last about 20-30 seconds on a player taking constant damage. It receives 28.6% of your +healing per charge (or 26.55% if you downrank to Rank 1 Earth Shield). Note that the 30% listed at Wowwiki is incorrect.<br>
<br>
The +healing is based on gear at the time cast, not when it procs. Therefore, you can put down Wrath of Air and use two trinkets to supercharge the Earth Shield before a pull. Note that Earth Shields cast on others do not get the benefit of your Purification talent and will heal for 10% less       <br>
<br>
The healing is attributed to the person on whom the shield is cast. While this hurts you on the healing meter, it’s a tremendous benefit for a warrior or druid tank. Each point of damage healed will generate 0.725 threat against all mobs. <br>
<br>
<b>Healing Stream Totem</b><br>
It gets 6% of your +healing per tick if you have 5/5 in Restorative totems and Purification. Otherwise, it receives 4.4% per tick. It’s a weak AOE heal. It can be a good choice if you are in a melee group and you have enough mana without mana spring. It can also be a good totem to drop right before a boss does a stun or raid-wide damage. However, once everyone is healed up, you’ll probably want to drop Mana Spring again.<br>
<br>
If there are multiple shaman in a party, their healing streams can stack. Like Earth shield, the bonus healing is applied at the time the totem is dropped. You can therefore drop Wrath of Air and pop trinkets to maximize the effect.<br>
<br>
<b>Gift of the Naaru (Draenei racial)</b><br>
<br>
Heals (Level * 15 + 35) damage over 15 sec. or 1085 damage at level 70, before factoring in +healing.<br>
-Ticks 5 times, once every 3 seconds. Heals 217 damage a tick. (once again, before +healing)<br>
-Receives 100% of your +healing over the 15 second duration.<br>
-Costs no mana, and can be used to get out of the FSR for full mana regen.<br>
-Counts as a holy spell, and can be used while locked out of the nature school. As a holy spell, it cannot be made instant by Nature's Swiftness.<br>
-Gains no benefit from Purification or Healing Focus. <br>
-As a HoT, it cannot crit, and thus cannot proc Ancestral Healing. <br>
<br>
<b>Berserking (Troll racial)</b><br>
6% of base Mana<br>
Instant cast (doesn’t trigger the GCD)<br>
Cooldown: 3 min  <br>
 <br>
Increases your casting and attack speed by 10% to 30%.  At full health the speed increase is 10% with a greater effect up to 30% if you are badly hurt (below 50%) when you activate Berserking.  Lasts 10 sec.<br>
<br>
Do not wait until you are low on health to use this ability. It’s a good idea to use any trinkets you might have at the same time.<br>

Using 1800 +healing<br>
<br>
<b>How to Calculate +Healing</b><br>
<br>
* Calculate spell time using the base spell cast time <u>before</u> talents and gear <br>
* Spells that take longer than 3.5 seconds are treated as if their casting time was 3.5 seconds, and spells faster than 1.5 seconds are treated as if their casting time was 1.5 seconds. <br>
* Damage and healing benefits from gear are applied <u>before</u> any talents or buffs that may otherwise increase your healing. <br>
<br>
To calculate the downrank penalty:<br>
<br>
     Level at which the next rank is learned +5/70 or<br>
     Level before next spell is learned +6/70<br>
<br>
For spells learned before Level 20 there is an additional penalty:<br>
Penalty = (20-Level Spell is Learned) * 0.0375<br>
<br>
For example: You have 1500 +healing and talents for Purification and Healing Way. You also have the relic <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=27544" target="_blank">[Totem of Spontaneous Regrowth]</a>. We'll assume that Healing Way is already stacked three times. The base healing of Rank 12 Healing Wave is 2,285.<br>

		<div id="post_message_577425"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->meta gem- you left out 26 healing and half cast.  I use half cast because I cannot stand yellow gems, I'd do all 22 healing gems if I could.<br>
<br>
My chain heal rank 2 gives me more single target efficiency than my healing wave rank 7.  It does 2400-2500 healing at 267 mana cost, my HW rank 7 does 2300-2400 healing at 323 mana cost without the chance to bounce.  I never cast healing wave anymore unless it's with NS, I speced out of improved/healing way and went 8/5/48.  If I need speed I use lhw, HW gets beat out by 2.0 holy light.  If I want efficiency I use chain heal.<br>
<br>
shamans overvalue mp5 in my opinion.  I saw a post of a shaman wanting a +healing flask when they had 182 mp5.  In comparison I have 116 mp5 yet 200 more+ healing and 206 more spell haste despite us both wearing 4 piece t6 and the like.<br>

</div>You should probably mention the reduced cast times of the first few ranks of HW, as this is one of the reasons you spam rank one and not a higher version.  Spamming HW1 with high crit is pretty amazing.<br>
<br>
Your table for HW is showing the talented version, which is fine.<br>
But you might as well add ranks 2 and 1.<br>
Rank 2 is 2 seconds normally, 1.5 talented.<br>
Rank 1 is 1.5 seconds normally, 1.0 talented...<br>
<br>
Might be worth mentioning the global cooldown (some of your abilities will be 1.5, some might be 1.0), and perhaps its relationship to lag - I remember this was huge when I played a shaman, and was throughout all of Naxx.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
I will try to add Rank 1 and Rank 2 to the table. Daidalos did not include those ranks in his spreadsheet so I'll have to add them.<br>
<br>
However, I do not see how <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=25893" target="_blank">[Mystical Skyfire Diamond]</a> is a good choice. The gem has no permanent benefit such as +12 Intellect and some mp5 or +26 healing with threat reduction. Also, the proc of next spell cast in half the time loses some of its benefit when the main spell you are casting (Chain Heal) is 2.5 seconds to start. Even though the cast of the spell will be faster you will still have to wait 1.5 seconds of the global cooldown to cast your next heal. Plus the uncertainty of when you will get the proc makes using it effectively difficult. I always thought this gems was more useful for a class like mages for their 6.0 second Pyroblasts. Can you explain why you like this gem in more detail?<br>

		<div id="post_message_577695"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I was wondering if you are planning on adding a section on healing PvP, particularly Arena.  I realize the site is raid-oriented, but the Elitist Jerks is the only place I trust to find accurate info on gameplay mechanics and strategy.  It seems that the Arena gear is designed around criting the LHW from some of the set bonuses.  Your hard work is greatly appreciated, Skyhoof.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_577746"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->As a shaman most of the time im assigned to raidhealing which basicly means chain heal/lesser healing wave rotation, i usualy end the night with less than 10 healing waves casted, almost all of them after nature swiftness, thats why i simply dont see the point to take improved healing wave and healing way. On MT healing paladins and priests simply outheal us (we do have one shaman on MT tho for ancestral fortitude buff). I can tsay im happy about Blizzard making us almost one button class, but thats the reality - chainheal is the best raidhealing skill in wow atm (there are not much, but still there are some fights where its not that efficient). We have the improved chainheal as talent and t6 bonuses are simply awesome, thats why as soon i droped t5 4piece bonus i droped the healing wave talents. I admit healing way looks nice on first sight - more healing is always nice, but if you think about it to be viable you have to be on MT healing and the maintank is always spamed from the paladins, hoted, earthshielded, power word shielded so this 18% more healing from healing wave ONLY are rather useless. As for the elemental warding - its an awesome talent which is not viable but compared to what you drop to spec it gives it huge advantage. Improved reincarnation is the most underrated resto talent imo, i admit you should not die, but still there some fights where this is unavoidable (Teron, Azgalor) or if you are very unlucky to take all the AOEs on the council or you aint healed on time on barrage on Illidan and ankh up w/o this talent is near to useless (you ankh with 2k mana = 4-5 heals, at least one of them on you). Anyway thats my opinion for the spec. About trinkets i think that eye of gruul is one of the best trinkets for a healer atm - passive healing and even if it procs only once per minute its worth more than the fathom-brooch, which has 1 minute hidden cooldown, imo only memento beats it (anyway im not much into theorycrafting). As for the macro section, i simply love it. I just havent interested myself that much about macros before (i had only some for downraking my spells). I have some question about them tho. First the relic swaping macro is very very nice but i loose the selfcast option when using it (im using Bongos2) so i have to add other lines with modifier for targets. Can that be avoided so i can keep using modifiers for downranking? For the mount macro i have added a line to equip my riding trinket, but i cant find a way to unequip it and equip my previous trinket (no matter of the set i am atm - resto, elemental or enhancment) after dismounting. I know outfitter equips your last trinket you had before when u make a riding set, so i hope it can be done with macro too.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I would also like some further insight and discussion about <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=25893" target="_blank">[Mystical Skyfire Diamond]</a>. I have been using <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=25901" target="_blank">[Insightful Earthstorm Diamond]</a> ever since I got my Tier 4 helm from Prince all those many months ago, and I have found it to be extremely underwhelming. I have read a few posts here on Elitist Jerks where healers swear by <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=25893" target="_blank">[Mystical Skyfire Diamond]</a> being hands down the best possible meta gem for healers, and I would like to know their reasoning. As it stands, as soon as Archimonde finally drops another protector token for my Tier 6 helm, I am most definitely going to socket it with the half-cast gem just to test out the theory. It would be nice to get some input from players who already have extensive experience with this gem though.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Thank you for your reply. Another question I have, then, is how spell haste is rated at an incredibly GODLY level for HEP in your Shamstats spreadsheet.

</div>Dependable haste &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; chance based haste.<br>
<br>
Also, there is a difference of 1 int, 12 heal, -30 haste and 11 mp5 when comparing Lightfathom to Dark Blessing. Having an extra 1.9% healing does seem like a big upgrade, doesn't it?<br>
Scarab gets a higher rating because it averages to 32 haste (320*6)/60. Even though it "rates" highly, I would still recommend against it. Healing is more of an art than a science, and I will always choose passive or on-use items over proc based buff items like this because <b>they are unreliable</b>. I would take lower rated trinkets over the Scarab because I have more control over when those extra functions are used.<br>
<br>
Also note that I'm currently re-doing the overall calculations at the moment<br>

Secondly, putting all of your points into resto is a waste, but you probably didn't read the posts explaining that.<br>
Thirdly, assuming a shadow priest is available drastically gimps you if you don't have one.<br>
Fourthly, how can you have 61 points in resto, but only have one in healing grace??<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Nature’s Guardian: This is a great talent with a tool tip that’s difficult to understand. Basically, it will automatically heal you about every 5 to 10 seconds if you are below 30% health. Plus, the heal reduces your threat. And it scales well, restoring 10% of your total health. It’s a must-have talent for resto PVP and highly desirable for shamans who raid.<br>

</div>First, if you take a look at the calculatoins on the HEP tab you'll see how Binkenstein arrived at the values. The math is solid. You could disagree with some of the premises on which the calculations are based. For example, the math assumes you are chain casting heals. However, in many portions of a fight, you pause between heals. Plus the calculations are based on a constant amount of haste. The trinket provides burst haste at unpredictable times. While burst haste may usually benefit DPS, it can occur at moments when no one needs a heal (or doesn't need it any faster at least). That is why I see the trinket has having limited value while haste itself may have great value (if you stack enough of it and have a shadow priest). I haven't done any number crunching but haste seems to be an all or nothing stat. I've gotten a few pieces and have not seen them make much of a difference in my healing. However, if I could get enough haste to reduce my cast times by 20%, I think that would be quite powerful. <br>
<br>
The problem would then be calculating the "sweet spot" for haste. It has diminishing returns. The faster your cast time gets, the less it is reduced by additional haste. However, creating such a model is difficult due to the stop and start nature of healing vs. DPS.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I'd say that description is as misleading as the tooltip (can't say I had any problems understanding the talent though, but i can see how it can be a bit confusing). You're not mentioning that it is a proc on taking damage, which was the thing I found wrong in the first version.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
And regarding the <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28190" target="_blank">[Scarab of the Infinite Cycle]</a>, it's very dependant on what fight you're up for and what role you have in that fight. For trash it's quite unbeatable in my eyes, since that's more or less about spamming Chain Heal nonstop and there are bosses that are close to that scenario as well. The non proc stat on the scarab (70 healing) is also quite nice for a trinket slot, and even if you can't rely on a proc I can't see many situations where a haste proc would be bad.<br>
I fully agree that controllable haste (or regen/+heal/whatever, for that matter) is much better than random procs though, even if I have a tendency to forget to use trinkets too often.<br>
<br>
<br>
Also, regarding Healing Grace, I have to say that I've skipped it in my later talent builds since I don't do that many 5man instances anymore and in raids I don't really have threat issues from heals at the moment. Might come a day when that changes I guess, since it can be handy on certain encounters with add spawning etc. Only time I overaggro is when I throw a heal a few seconds too early on a trash wave in Hyjal, and that's usually just my own fault from being too eager on my buttons.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_578065"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I really must butt in here with the Meta gem talk.<br>
<br>
I really think it's bad saying "Dependable haste &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; chance based haste.". I respect your work Binkenstein, but as a healer, it's absolutly the opposite imho. It's the very nature of the meta that does it good - not how you work out how much spellhaste it gets effectivly.<br>
<br>
What the MSD can do is save lives in a very bursty way during bad moments, and I can assure you that neither the Bracing or the Insightful meta gems can do that, and that alone makes it worth putting up on that list Skyhoofs origional post.<br>
<br>
Skyhoof - your very mentioning of Binkensteins Shamstats is good and all, but as you say yourself none of the values can be set in stone in any way because healing is so flexible. This is why it's bad to laber stats and why you have to get a feel (yes a feel, it very much can differ from which guild you play in for example) for what you need and not need.<br>
So basically: It can be missleading.<br>
For example: If you dont struggle with mana why keep the the insightful meta? If you can live without it, why not go with something that can be a lifesaver?<br>
Why gimp your whole gearsetup to be able to attain the +healing meta? Its horrible req makes it less desirable right there.<br>
<br>
Healing is so diffrent from DPS when you want to put numbers into play, and math fails at times, simply because of how the nature of the playstyle is. Anyways, what you say about haste: "The faster your cast time gets, the less it is reduced by additional haste" is not true. All spell haste is based on your base spellcasting time (Or did I missunderstood what you were refering to?). So spellhaste is good until you start to butt in with the GCD during spam heal moments.<br>
<br>
Dont get me wrong here, you can easily see and show how effective a certain heal is (which you've done with great tables Skyhoof), and thus make sure to use it in a good way. <br>
When healing however we need to account for alot, and thus use diffrent ranks depending on how the raid/tanks take dmg. So weather a spell has better DPM or not when it gets into action gets almost irrelevant, atleast when comparing the same spell like CHrankX vs CHrankY, and HWrankX vs HWrankY, because in the end it is about keeping the raid topped off and using what heal that can heal for most by using the least mana without overhealing - and this differ. Alot.<br>
<br>
All in all, I'm not putting down on your work here Skyhoof - I just dont agree on some things written after the main post, and disagree with not putting the MSD in it, and the reasons for that is what I've just presented. <br>
<br>
Good job nonetheless<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

You can also spam Water Shield while running, e.g. from Doomfires to trigger procs (probably changed, haven't been resto for a few weeks).<br>
<br>
If the 26 +heal meta didn't have such strict requirements, I would probably choose that one.<br>

Also, in my opinion Healing Grace and the Subtlety cloak enchant are overrated. While there aren't many alternatives for the enchant, I prefer Focused Mind for bosses like Archimonde and Azgalor. There are few bosses that silence, but it's nice to have.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">In the old trinket thread I remember that Gurgthock spoke very highly of the Scarab of the Infinite Cycle. While that was a long time ago, I don't think that the reason for it has changed. Very solid healing stats plus very nice burst healing at times. Now longevity trinkets are nice, but if you have the mana you don't need more. Spell haste can sometimes be very handy when you just need to pump out as much heals as you can.</div>

</div>Lets try this another way. Lets take two shaman, both resto. One has 0% crit chance, the other has 25%. Both output 2000 hps. (and this is ignoring the armour buff too)<br>
Shaman A heals for 5k each cast. (I was getting 5.2k in T5 back when I was healing)<br>
Shaman B heals for 4k base, 6k crit.<br>
<br>
If you need more than 1600 solid hps, Shaman B isn't going to cut it. This is why I do not use Scarab/MSD.<br>
<br>
As I said earlier, I'm reviewing the EP values on my spreadsheets, following the changes I've made on the elemental side, which should allow me to de-value haste in response to the increased mana use, because currently it is not taking that into account.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_578113"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I like the way this discussion is going about spell haste and healing bursts. I feel that it's worth talking more about.<br>
<br>
First off, I think we can all agree that during many encounters in the game there are times where a great deal of raid healing is needed, and you will be spamming chain heal at various levels of desperation. There are other times during some encounters where not a lot of raid healing is needed and you have a chance to pause and consider who to heal.<br>
<br>
We are also agreed that during those times that we pause, spell haste and proccing MSD and trinkets is absolutely useless to us - therefore more mana regen is better. However, it must also be said that if you have enough mana regeneration and are confident that you are not going to run out of mana during an encounter, the usefulness of being able to regenerate more mana is not very high. If you have enough mana and mana regen to survive the next burst healing phase and subsequent phases to last the encounter, more mana regen is useless.<br>
<br>
Now, for periods in which burst raid healing is needed (Gurtogg Bloodboil, Reliquary of Souls phase 3, and Illidan Phase 2 come to mind), I would think that the <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=25893" target="_blank">[Mystical Skyfire Diamond]</a> would be very useful. During these phases you are spamming chain heal over and over and over again. I would <i>think</i> that you are almost guaranteed at least one proc of that meta gem during this intense spam, and since the damage on the raid is equally if not more intense, that proc of a half-cast can and WILL help. <br>
<br>
I would apply the same logic to spell haste. As stated by Skyhoof's post earlier, the value of spell haste comes when you are spamming heals nonstop. Boosting your HPS through spell haste can and will aid you in saving your raid during these times.<br>
<br>
To reiterate: <br>
<br>
Mana regen does something for you during any time in which you have less than 100% mana. However, if you have a good enough feel of an encounter to be confident that you will not go OOM during or until the fight ends (it's OK to be OOM when the boss hits the ground, guys, just not before) further mana regen has very limited use.<br>
<br>
Burst spell haste like the MSD and the <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28190" target="_blank">[Scarab of the Infinite Cycle]</a> have a very high chance of proccing when you are spamming non-stop, and their procs will most likely NOT go to waste if the raid is taking heavy damage. Even though they do nothing during times of light raid damage, they will probably come through for you when you really need it.<br>
<br>
Dependable spell haste follows the same logic as burst spell haste. It is nearly useless when there's not much raid healing to be done, but it will greatly facilitate you in keeping your raid alive when they need it.<br>
<br>
<br>
In conclusion:<br>
<br>
Assemble a set of healing gear, focusing heavily on Mp5. THEN assemble a set of healing gear with spell haste. Put on the spell haste stuff when you feel comfortable with your ability to not run out of mana during an encounter.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_578114"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->for me the insightful means the exact opposite- I need to focus more on +int and mp5 which I really don't want.  Like I said before I would socket everything with 22 healing if I could, and 2 blue+2 yellow requirement takes away from that.  MSD lets me only use 1 yellow which I only use because +20 healing and +5 int = 22 healing.  If it procs 3 times in a fight and you end with 2000 mana then the insightful is all but wasted.  MSD is almost never wasted I think, because any spell cast faster is a benefit.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

If you consider it accurate though, then the trinket section of the OP is a bit off. It lists the Rejuv gem as a "Tier 1" trinket, lumping it in with some green quest rewards and the LCPB. But if you calculate the stat weights its as good, if not better than, the Fathom Lord Brooch.<br>
<br>
One other question - since I'm primarily enhancement for the raids my picks at healing gear usually include whatever the left overs are that everyone else passes on, which of late looks to be a lot of haste gear. I picked up some leather healing gloves with haste on them from akama. I've heard many healers scoff at haste but I'm not really seeing what the negative impact of it is, since from a melee perspective haste is fantastic. (For a melee, 1% haste will raise your autoattack DPS by 1%)<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_578547"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I personally don't consider mp5 weights to be a static ratio since once you are not really in danger our running out of mana I prefer to just stack pure  +healing.<br>
<br>
Regarding haste it is an excellent way to increase hps however unlike melee there is a (possible) downside of increased mana consumption.  I say possible because if you have 2 pc t6 and sufficent regen you can easily accomodate the increase in mana consumption.  Personally I use about 100+ haste rating and love it, but I don't wear it for every fight.  On long mana intensive fights I prefer less haste and more regen.  The leather haste healing gear in BT is excellent and I personally love alot of haste for chain heal spam.<br>
<br>
Haste for a shaman is very rarely wasted imo.  Other healers use alot of instant casts making haste rather a waste of itemization, however mostly being chain heal bots I personally find it extremely usefull.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_578607"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Thanks for all the great feedback and discussion. I hope it continues.<br>
 <br>
I expanded the section on meta gems, giving more information about each of the three gems and some of the pros and cons. <br>
 <br>
I still think <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=25901" target="_blank">[Insightful Earthstorm Diamond]</a> is your best choice. Keep in mind that it has no cooldown while Blizzard added at 45 second cool down to <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=25893" target="_blank">[Mystical Skyfire Diamond]</a> in Patch 2.3. In real raids this means you will get a proc about once per minute. Sure, if it procs at just the right time, it’s a lifesaver. But many times the proc will be wasted while extra mana is never wasted. We have all been in fights where one healer died and others had to step up casting, depleting their mana pools faster than normal. Or even worse – your shadow priest could die. And there are fights were if the boss gets off a heal, the battle drags on longer, using more mana. So having a little more mp5 never hurts.<br>
 <br>
I also added a few basics about Haste. However we could use some more discussion on the subject. I would also love to see some WWS data. Here are a few examples of what I’m looking for:<br>
 <br>
• Haste – multiple attempts on the same boss during which you wore haste gear for some pulls and not for others<br>
• Haste – multiple shamans in the same raid. They are of equal skill and gear. One wear haste the other does not.<br>
• Tier 2: same thing as haste. Would love to see this set bonus in action and be able to compare it with your other gear for the same fight. <br>
 <br>
Made another attempt at explaining Nature’s Guardian. I have no idea why I keep stumbling over this talent. <br>
 <br>
Added the 0-0-61 spec.<br>
Added cooldowns on trinkets<br>
Added Rank 1 and Rank 2 Healing Wave to the chart<br>
Added a section on spell hit for interrupts to the Gear section.<br>

</div>No, that is not a typo. Usually people say that I don’t put enough weight on mp5. However, I agree with Praetorian that since they buffed mana spring and water shield it has become much less of an issue. <br>
 <br>
I also agree with Daidalos that mp5 weights are far from static. Once you have enough mana regeneration, you want to stack plus healing or haste or another stat. How much you value mp5 really depends on how much you already have and how much mana a particular fight requires.<br>

		<div id="post_message_578649"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->For a healer basically every stat can potentially be wasted. mana stats are wasted if you had any mana left at the end of the fight. Haste is wasted if you didn't do your max HPS at any point in the fight or if you went oom before the end and people died as a result. +healign is wasted as well if all your heals healed for more than the health deficit of your target. You can even say DPS is wasted if you're not hitting the enrage timer and nobody is dying because DPS is too slow.<br>
<br>
The real question you should be asking yourself is "which stat is least likely to be wasted for me?" Which depends on your current gear, the buffs you're receiving from the raid (mostly shadow priest support) and the nature of the fight. But remember at the end if a healer doesn't have "wasted stats" he probably doesn't have enough stats and your raid is going to wipe. At the end having "wasted mana", "wasted +healing" or "wasted haste" in facts makes it so you're actually overkilling the encounter which increases the level of certainity you have for 1-shotting it. Problem is determining which of those stats is more likely to not be wasted if things go bad.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

All there is to it is this, if you are currently at any amount of HP and you take a hit that results in you being left with 29% HP or less, then there is a 50% chance of being healed for 10% of your total HP immediately after taking the hit.

		<div id="post_message_578664"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Mp5 value isn't just dynamic based on the fight, it's dynamic based on your progression.  I use a lot more mp5 while learning fights, and as you master and farm them a number of things happen.  Healer gear gets better, DPS gear gets better so fights end faster, and healers get more efficient with their tasks with experience.  So I go from slamming 10 SMPs over a 23-minute Illidan kill to using 5 Unstable pots over a 13-minute kill, despite dropping mp5 in the interim.  The Water Shield and Mana Spring changes are obviously huge.  I'm sticking with around a 5:1 value of healing:mp5 on gear, and emphasizing healing in my gem choices...especially considering that +healing scales so well with Chain Heal.  <br>
<br>
Whereas I used to use the int-mp5 talasites/seasprays in yellow sockets (royal nightseye/shadowsong in reds and blues, always), I've switched to full luminous pyrestones.  In a couple red-socket items I've considered using +healing spinels, but those are always in such demand (and will be when Sunwell comes out) that it seems extravagant.<br>
<br>
Regarding haste rating...it's okay.  It's certainly not a poor choice anymore, but it remains situational.  For a DPS class haste translates directly into more damage, which is inherently good.  For a healer it translates into more output, which is generally positive but not inherently good.  Pretty much the only fight where I swap out my Scarab is Council, where it's an endurance/patience trial and the haste procs tend to increase my mana consumption rate faster than I'd like.  For fights like Teron and RoS, where I'm just dumping heals as fast as I can, haste is great.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_578674"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->The one thing in favor of haste-procs is that, since they proc off of spellcasts at a constant probability, they're more likely to proc (per time interval) when you're chain-casting, which is when you would most want them and when you would most be able to take advantage of them. The procs will tend to cluster more around their own ideal circumstances. However, the internal cooldown more than anything else is really what upsets that sort of statistical dependability. If you happen to get "lucky" too soon not only is the proc wasted then, it's also unavailable later.<br>
<br>
And I'm going to chime in here that healing, compared to say dps, obeys threshold mechanics more than it obeys MOAR=GUD mechanics. You need more regen, until you can last the fight. You need more +healing, until your throughput matches the damage the raid is taking. There is of course room for letting personal skill stretch your abilities in favor of one or the other, but the stat weighting for healing is probably better defined by a piecewise function than a solid set of weights.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">For a healer basically every stat can potentially be wasted. mana stats are wasted if you had any mana left at the end of the fight. Haste is wasted if you didn't do your max HPS at any point in the fight or if you went oom before the end and people died as a result. +healign is wasted as well if all your heals healed for more than the health deficit of your target.</div>

</div>I realize you're trying to state a larger absolute principle, but I think you're being too clinical about it.  You don't want to finish every fight on your last drop of mana.  What if your amazing DPS ignored those parasites and shit hit the proverbial fan?  What if somebody pulled aggro on RoS and it charged into your caster camp?  What if you get some bad FA ports and you lose a bunch of healers all at once?  Any time shit goes down and you have to pick up that slack or make a big save, you'll be spending a lot of mana to hold things together and pacing yourself to be dry at the end is irresponsible.  Looking back at our first Illidan kill, I have about 50% mana at 8%.  Then parasites run amok and people start dying and all the surviving healers are spamming their fastest heals to hold it together.  I'm basically dry when Illidan dies.  <br>
<br>
Maybe you're talking about ideal scenarios, but for me the big appeal of being a healer is the unpredictability and imprecision.  You can't ever be perfect.  Itemization should address your playstyle, play to the strengths of your class and its mechanics and put you in a position to excel.  I think it's silly to look at those decisions as minimizing waste.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_578802"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I believe haste is one of the most valuable healing stats to date, as it adds incredible versatility to shamans in combining the base heal alongside with +healing effects. This also allows for greater saves in the "oh shit" moments when it’s held in larger amounts, and it can also be used to increase movement in heavy traveling fights while keeping healing maximized. On top of everything, it boosts the effect of nearly every trinket listed.<br>
<br>
So first off, adding the ability to increase output beyond what +healing allows is one of its main features, since it encompasses output from the base spell as well as the +healing added onto it; therefore, it scales better than any other healing stat, in terms of straight output. As a consequence, it is also quite valuable with healing trinkets. However, to allow for this increased output you would need great regen or a large mana poll. But in some cases this is a moot point, since there are several fights it seems like Teron Gorefiend where mana is not a problem, and only output is. Also with increased output in less time allows for greater movement with the same output that someone would have without haste. In SSC and TK, the ability to heal then move is completely necessary in nearly all of the fights, so it adds increased ability to keep the raid alive, as well as keeping yourself alive. The only problem I currently see is that there is not enough haste gear in the game to make it as viable, but we could very well see at level 80 the ability to choose between haste and healing for how you want to increase your output.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Not once. I see those procs as a nice bonus, nothing to rely on. If i'm getting behind in healing for some reason, it can help me to catch up again. I can remember several occasions where an MSD proc definitely prevented a wipe, or at least the death of some melees.<br>
The mana gain from the ISD can be compensated by other gear choices, while the MSD proc is unique.<br>

</div>While the tooltip of the spell still says "2% Chance" I believe that this meta was changed in 2.3 to be 5%.

I see modeling the gem as a passive mp5 helps to simplify things, but spells/minute tends to vary widely, particularly as a healer. It seems to make more sense to me to model the effect as a flat -mana cost to each spell, -6 if its 2% or -15 if its 5%.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Just copy what Nacht put there. Its the most clear and concise description of Earth Shield here. And mention the threat reduction.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I have to say, I think the perception of haste to a spellcaster DPS in comparison to haste to a healer is a bit skewed. When a mage grabs haste, they get only their DPS increased. Instead of, "More damage in the same amount of time," it's "Same damage in less time," which is in almost all parameters, the exact same thing. Spamming 7 fireballs and 1 scorch on repeat is not much of a sweat-breaker and doesn't require the same reaction as a healer needs when something happens. If the boss moves slightly out of range during the fight, the mage simply gets back in range and continues his spell rotation, maybe missing one fireball in that rotation. <br>
<br>
Therefore, spell haste simply increases DPS and has no other real value to a mage other than its singular numeric benefit.<br>
<br>
Once that tank moves out of range to follow that boss, however, the healer has to break his/her own spell and follow along and make sure that the tank doesn't die within 3 seconds if a hit is landed. If you're gonna get that heal spell off in time, spell haste may make the difference- you need that sucker's health UP!<br>
<br>
While numerically, spell haste is equal to DPS as it is to healers, having spell haste has the benefit of aiding player reaction. Spell haste does not help out with HPM, but it's got the value of helping buff against screw-ups.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_579130"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Gotta say that I am loving spell haste.  At least in ZA, which I assume is similar to the rest of the T5 content, there are periods of significant burst and HPM isn't keeping people alive, HPS is.  Mana can be recovered later.  Static spell haste on my gear and proc spell haste from a trinket/meta gem and on-demand spell haste from berserking and bloodlust are all simply amazing at getting a very hurt raid up to healthy hp quickly.  Spell crit is fairly reliable for me, as well -- I would never drop Tidal Mastery after seeing how much I can crit in practice.<br>
<br>
Lastly, I don't think enough has been said about how useful it can to take those "questionable" talents in the Restoration tree.  At this point, I firmly believe in a 0/0/61 build where only Improved Reincarnation and Nature's Guidance are skipped.  They are both situationally useful, but useful on a similar level to as Ancestral Knowledge, worth about one heal over the course of any boss fight on average.  Totemic Focus really helps with the expensive totems like Windfury, Wrath of Air and Fire Elemental, saving easily 500-1000  over the course of a fight.  Focused Mind plus some spell haste and spell crit help assure that Shamans have strong silence recovery (similar to priest's shield and pom and druid's swiftmend).<br>
<br>
In short, I don't feel that Shamans are a well-rounded healer without a very deep investment in the Restoration tree and a good spread of stats (not neglecting even spell crit).  In doing so, and especially combined with the buffs we come with, I find that Shamans join Priests as jacks of all trades, able to handle any healing situation gracefully.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Never realy agreed with the low rating on stamina compared to int. Need it for doomfires etc. The ones that die the most in raids are the mages who put everything into +damage. Int is pretty useless since most of my healing is done on regen. I have 10.5k mana and dont realy need it. So I look at +12 int or +18 sta on shield and see it as 3.6 +heal or 180 hp. The +heal is trivial but I can always use more hp. The extra benefits on int with +crit and more from MT dont add to that much.<br>
<br>
Its the same argument as taking a 8/0/53 build. The survival talents dont help your healing but they help you stay alive to deliver that healing.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_579256"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Firstly fantastic to see a post for the Shaman Healers, I hope this post achieves the epic proportions that Malan's Enhancement Shaman post achieved.<br>
<br>
Like Malan I am primarily our raiding Enhancement Shaman, but for certain raids (usually if one of our main healers is out) I respec and heal.<br>
<br>
I'd just like to add my recommendation for a healing addon- Healbot.<br>
<br>
Its layout is very similar to Grid, has incoming heal tracking, and is easily configured. But my favourite function is the ease at which you can set the "on click" spells. For example, I have Rank 4 Chain Heal on Left click, Natures Swfitness + Healing Wave on Right Click, Mousewheel up for Cleanse Poison, Mousewheel Down for Cleanse Disease and Shift modifier for my downranked spells.<br>
<br>
What made this addon for me was how damn easy it was to configure. For those of you always on the lookout for something new I can highly recommend it.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Lastly, I don't think enough has been said about how useful it can to take those "questionable" talents in the Restoration tree.  At this point, I firmly believe in a 0/0/61 build where only Improved Reincarnation and Nature's Guidance are skipped.  They are both situationally useful, but useful on a similar level to as Ancestral Knowledge, worth about one heal over the course of any boss fight on average.  Totemic Focus really helps with the expensive totems like Windfury, Wrath of Air and Fire Elemental, saving easily 500-1000  over the course of a fight.  Focused Mind plus some spell haste and spell crit help assure that Shamans have strong silence recovery (similar to priest's shield and pom and druid's swiftmend).</div>

</div>I swear by improved reincarnation - more on that later.<br>
<br>
Let's talk about Totemic Focus. Here is the WWS from my latest Illidan Stormrage kill:<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080411144430/http://www.its.caltech.edu/~gian/STASIS/wws-20071216-2104/eniwei.html" target="_blank">WWS</a><br>
<br>
It was a 19 minute fight.<br>
<br>
Notice I laid 10 Wrath of Air totems, 9 Mana Springs, 1 Fire Elemental, and 1 Fire Resistance totems. I don't have Totemic Focus, but if I DID have that talent, here's how much mana I would have saved:<br>
<br>
Wrath of Air Totem:     320 * 0.25 * 10 = 800<br>
Mana Spring Totem:    120 * 0.25 * 9 = 270<br>
Fire Elemental Totem:  680 * 0.25 = 170<br>
Fire Resistance Totem: 245 * 0.25 = 61.25<br>
<br>
Total Mana Saved: 1301.25<br>
<br>
While this may look substantial at first, take a look at all the other mana I'm gaining from other things in my WWS. 26K Mana from Shadow Priest, 17.6k from mana potions, 9350 from Mana Spring, 4883 from Water Shield, and 2795 from Mana Tide. In comparison, this amount of mana saved from Totemic Focus is tiny. Also notice that I only laid Mana Tide once over the course of a 19 minute fight. This implies that I didn't even need that extra ~3k mana at all, so what good would saving that 1301 mana do me? None at all.<br>
<br>
We have now established that it took an entire 19 minutes for Totemic Focus to save me only 1301 mana. Logically, in a shorter fight it would save me even less mana.<br>
<br>
Let's talk Improved Reincarnation. I have around 10k mana unbuffed. Should I die and reincarnate without talents, I would get back 2000 mana with which to keep healing. If I have it talented, I would gain an additional 2000 mana - that's already more than what Totemic Focus saves me over the course of a 19 minute fight. The point is this: Reincarnation at its' best saves your ass when you or someone else in the raid makes a mistake and gets you killed. Imp. Reincarnation at its' worst is a free 2000 extra mana when you're totally oom, as you can just go ahead and kill yourself in an AOE and pop back up to get that mana instantly.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_579331"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Skyhoof - have you ever tried MSD? <br>
<br>
I feel there is to big generalisation around healing here. It can't be min maxed like DPS. "More mana regen is never wasted" - everytime you have more than 0 mana when the fight is over, the mana you had left was wasted mana regen. It's always good to be on a safe side, but if you Dont have mana problems, mana regen is a wasted stat. It's never bad to add up on it, but taking it over something that Can save life is in my oppinion very much inferior even if it's abit random.<br>
<br>
I can count several times the MSD has saved the entire melee squad on fights like Azgalor for example, and also prevented wipes on several occasions.<br>

</div>While the itemization isn't quite as absurd for this as it used to be, Tidal Mastery is a damn good place to spend 5 points if you're already spending 3/3 in Ancestral Healing, which you should be. I wouldn't spec 8/0/53 without it. The 25% AC boost that this proc provides will typically provide a good deal more AC than an Ironshield potion. In my current Kara-level gear, an AH proc is worth 3750 AC while an Ironshield is only 2500, and any raid tank can tell you how Ironshields save their ass. It doesn't seem like a lot, but 5% more crit across 3 shamans in the raid trying to get a 15% proc goes a very long way indeed.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>During a 19 minute fight I would presumably have at least 9 Super Mana Potion cooldowns available to me. Had I truly needed mana, I would have drank 4 more. I didn't, and I didn't need to use two of my Mana Tide cooldowns either.<br>
<br>
The point I'm trying to make is that Totemic Focus is one of the weakest talents in the Resto tree, and if you are thinking about speccing 8/0/53, it's one of the first talents you should throw away.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_579590"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->As a resto shaman who is about to enter T6 content in earnest (we're on our 3rd week working on Kael) I wonder if I could get some guidance from T6 shaman.  Haste is a really attractive stat based on what I'm usually doing in raids, and I've already picked up a couple of ZA haste pieces (chest and mace from Zul'jin, neck from Akil'zon) that seem to be significant upgrades in T5 content.  However, I'm still stuck prioritizing haste versus stats for the next level of content we'll be facing.<br>
<br>
I'm on raid healing and "watch the MT" duty about 90% of the time in raids, meaning that, like most shaman, about 3/4 of my heals are chain heal, with some healing wave rank 8 thrown in for various top offs as needed.  I try to avoid using LHW if possible because I find it inefficient, so I only use it in emergency situations.  My lack of enthusiasm for LHW leads to my question:<br>
<br>
What are the MINIMUM stats needed for T6 healing?  In other words - how much spell haste can I stack without sacrificing MP/5 and +heal to an unacceptable point? <br>
<br>
Obviously there are going to be situational differences for fights of various lengths, demands, etc.  For the sake of discussion, let's assume everyone knows those things, and is going to get two sets of gear - +haste and stats sets.  I'm interested to know how to prioritize acquisition of gear in those two sets.

</div>I started Mount Hyjal and Black Temple before Zul'Aman came out, so I had zero spell haste, around 1800 +healing, and 174 unbuffed Mp5. During the encounters of Hyjal and BT you will find that certain boss fights require a lot of mana regen, and certain boss fights require almost none at all. <br>
<br>
Another thing to note is that Kael'thas himself is a much longer and more difficult fight than all of the early BT/Hyjal encounters combined. If you have the gear to defeat Kael'thas, you are more than geared enough to take on Rage Winterchill, Anetheron, High Warlord Naj'entus, Supremus, and Shade of Akama (maybe even more).<br>
<br>
Rage Winterchill is a quick and easy fight in which you should not have any mana problems whatsoever. Feel free to wear your spell haste set on him.<br>
<br>
Anetheron requires a little bit more mana regen, but not much. Be prepared to spend a lot of periods not healing due to being swarmed or slept.<br>
<br>
High Warlord Naj'entus is a fight in which the entire raid is taking heavy damage throughout the entire fight. When you're learning it, stack MP5 because it's not THAT short. As your guild starts putting this fight on farm, feel free to put on some spell haste.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>No, but I have tried the Scarab of the Infinite Cycle. It’s the same concept. About once per minute, you can cast spells faster. One spell with MSD, as many as you can get off in 6 seconds with the Scarab. I understand why you and others like it. It’s clear that myself and other healers prefer consistency over lucky procs. Believe me, if the Scarab was an on-use trinket that you could activate on a two-minute cooldown, we would all be using it. Time to move this discussion along.<br>

</div>Yes, I’ve heard the same thing. However, I cannot find anything in the patch notes or a blue post. We do know that they increased the proc rate of the Mystical Skyfire Diamond. Does anyone know where Thott and Wowhead get their data for proc rates? <br>
<br>
I looked at some WWS for a few recent fights. In one, the gem procced 5 times. I cast 100 heals, dropped 11 totems, cast Bloodlust once, activated a trinket twice and cast water shield and Earth Shield a few times. The fight was about 6 minutes long so I got back roughly 20.8 mp5 and it proced about 4.3% of the time.<br>
<br>
In another fight, I got 3 procs. I cast 98 heals, dropped 5 totems, cast Bloodlust once and water shield a few times. That fight lasted about 4.5 minutes. So I got back 16.6 mp5 and it proced about 4.7% of the time.<br>
<br>
That seems to be consistent with the 5% proc rate listed on Thott and Wowhead. <br>
<br>
Ok, now let’s look at the entire raid – a much longer span of time. It procced 46 times. I cast 1,403 heals. I also got Prayer of Mending 12 times and Lifebloom 17 times but I don’t know if that counts. I dropped 145 totems. I cast Bloodlust 9 times. I cast Totemic Call 11 times. NS 3 times (if that counts). And water shield at least 17 times (probably more like 25) and Earth Shield an unknown number of times. That’s a minimum of  46/1585. So that’s 2.9% proc. If I count the PoM and Lifebloom and the procs themselves (because it can proc off itself), it procced 2.7% of the time.<br>
<br>
Generally, the more data you have, the more accurate the result. I would tend to think data from an entire night of raiding (4 hours) would be closer to the actual figure than a single fight that lasts 6 minutes. That would put the proc rate around 3% (although there’s enough margin for error that it could really still be 2%). <br>

</div>Excellent point and well said. Basically took your post and added it to the talent description of Tidal Mastery.<br>
<br>
Nature’s Guardian: Revised Description<br>
<br>
Tidal Mastery: Revised Description<br>
<br>
Shield Enchants: Added +18 Stamina. Thud00 makes an excellent point that shaman get their mana from mp5, not having a large initial mana pool. I still think +12 Intellect is a good enchant but so is +18 Stamina. I actually have +12 Intellect on my main shield and +18 Stamina on a secondary shield that I use for fights where I need more health.<br>
<br>
Added Healbot to mods and plan to give it a try myself in the next week or so. Sounds interesting.<br>
<br>
Added the trick of using Totem of the Maelstrom and Rank 1 Healing Wave to proc Ancestral Fortitude and regen outside of the 5-second rule. <br>
<br>
I did not have a chance to digest the T2 numbers posted but I can't wait to delve into them -- after at least 3 cups of coffee.<br>
<br>

</div>There's not much excuse to skip Imp HW unless you exclusively chain heal, and you're probably a terrible shaman if you do that. The 5% mana savings you'd get on the rest of your spells isn't much to offset the ridiculous throughput increase that Imp HW gives. Healing Way's usefulness is debatable (I'm personally a fan), but I'd agree it's worthless without Imp HW.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">The three-piece set bonus of Ten Storms is “increases the amount healed by Chain Heal to targets beyond the first by 30%”<br>
<br>
I couldn’t download the actual spreadsheet but I worked out what formula you used to calculate the set bonus:<br>
<br>
Total Healing = T1 + (T1*0.5)*1.3+ [(T1*0.5)*1.3]*0.5*1.3<br>
<br>
T1= Healing done to Target #1<br>
<br>
I believe the correct formula is: <br>
Total Healing = T1 + (T1*0.5)*1.3+ (T1*0.25)*1.3<br>
<br>
If I understand the set bonus correctly, the plus 30% is applied seperately to each jump beyond the first. You can’t divide the healing done on the second jump in half and then add 30%. You need to take 25% of the first heal and then multiply by 30%. Otherwise, you are double counting the 30% boost.<br>
<br>
Also, your values do not include the Tier 6 set bonus. The mana cost you list are the normal mana costs with talents. You need to include those T6 set bonuses in your calculations -- and drink more coffee  If I can find the time, I will do the math and post the results (properly coded for easy reading).</div>

So basically you can't argue against more mana as "I don't need more mana" as same can be said about HPS. However when you actually look at it as "so what do I need more, mana efficiency or HPS?" you realize that at least most of the time, HPS is more of an issue than mana efficiency. However this isn't nescessarily the case in every fight and/or for every raid setup, so shouldn't be looked at as a rule of thumb (or we'd see everyone stacking pure +healing/haste ignoring other stats completely).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_580219"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->For the Healing basics and/or Pro-tip section:<br>
<br>
Some fights will require different strategies of gear; be it group make up (Shadow priests) or Boss mechanics (Reliquary/Essence of Souls).  Carrying different sets of gear, trinkets, and weapons (enchants) to swap in can help maximize Healing per second over time.  Examples could include two healing maces, one with +81 Healing, another with Spellsurge.  The sets of gear to try to collect include a mana regen set (something around 200mp5 unbuffed) a pure +healing (perhaps 2800ish depending on the drop rate of healing maces &gt;.&lt;) and even a spell haste set (not sure of a haste rating value).  The majority of fights will want a nice mix of healing and regen but there are a few that would favor a more "purist" set.<br>
<br>
In many end-game guilds the same raiders tend to be present every week.  This means that learning the places they like to stand, and the style of play they enjoy (I am thinking Illidan Demon Phase) can help maximize chain heal effectiveness.  By learning where your fellow raiders like to stand you can, hopefully, make the quick decision on whether a quick Lesser Healing Wave, Healing wave or Chain Heal would yield the most benefit.    <br>
<br>
I believe it was mentioned, but I want to emphasize pre-healing.  Karazhan and to a lesser extent some of the 25 mans can be healed fine by reactively healing (that is waiting for the raid/tank to take damage, then healing them up) however in later aspects of the game namely Magtheridon and beyond it is essential to either downrank spam (I prefer HW rank 7) or max rank and cancel even if the tank/target is at full health.  The tricky point of this is trying to pre-heal raid damage.  If you know that some melee is going to take raid damage, but are unsure who, simply target one of them and begin casting chain heal.  As long as the heal comes after the damage at least two of the chains should heal the wounded.  Pre-healing like this tends to be rather in-efficient and grosses a large amount of overhealing, but is almost necessary.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_580235">Chain heal - "Each jump reduces the effectiveness of the heal by 50%". Quite accurate.<br>
<br>
On the first jump you are left with 50% multiply by 1.3 from the 3TS bonus to get 65%. Reduce that by 50% and multiply by 1.3 to get 42.25%. Quite accurate, you can see it in the combat log yourself if you wear the set.<br>
<br>
I posted some numbers on this subject quite recently in another thread.<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
The armor buff talent is certainly worth taking. On illidan we have the shamans HW spamming the tank for the armor buff. The tanks takes huge damage when he enrages and that buff lowers the 13k hits down to something more manageable. Its nice to have the crit talent to make this worthwhile.<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
Ancestral knowledge is pretty hopeless. If you have 10k mana you get 500 more. In a raid with an SP I can have 700 MP5. Mana pool expansion is expensive in stats and does nothing. If you were going to run out you will still run out. I guess you could argue it also offers 2 MP5 from MT too. There are better ways to spend 5 points.<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
Yea you can pretty much ignore mana regen when you are with an SP. But sometimes you are not, you get stuck with the rogues for WF or because the mages monopolise the SP. You have to maintain enough MP5 to still operate at a level above spamming CH1. Trying to heal with 100 MP5 and 2600 +heal is not a good idea, you are too specialist, too dependent on that SP. On longer fights SP tend to run out of mana anyhow, they seem to burn the stuff. This results in you getting less mana than you were expecting.</div>

		<div id="post_message_580236">Efficiency and mana is rather the same thing. Basically what I count is the amount of healing I can do if I use all my mana available from all sources in a given fight, and that is the only value that matters in terms of "not going oom". This is increased by all stats except haste, of course. More healing will yield more healing per mana and more mana will yield more heals and thus more healing, and therefore mp5 and +healing are interchangeable for this aspect of healing. Even crit helps here, although very slightly, as while it will generally overheal a lot more than your normal overhealing, it will sometimes not overheal and thus provide some kind of additional healing per mana.<br>
<br>
Burst however has nothing to do with mp5, regen or even crit (as you naturally assume that if someone will die if your crit doesn't heal you fail, and you don't put people's lives on the dice especially when 9/10 will fail). Haste however helps a lot here as it's the cheapest stat per itemization point to increase HPS.<br>
<br>
If you're going oom in a fight burst doesn't really matter as your higher HPS will not help becuase you won't be able to use it when oom and people will die. Then again if you don't have enough HPS people will die and you won't be able to use all that mana. If no matter how you adjust your gear people still die due to lack of HPS and/or mana, you need better gear or more healers in the raid (or a better raid, or better skills, but assuming skillful play for your raid it's the gear that's the issue). I'm noticing very few complaints of "he died because X was oom!" compared to how many times I get "Damn that heal didn't land fast enough / didn't heal for enough / he got bursted" or the likes. So I'm tending to improving my HPS over efficiency, while keeping an efficiency set on pieces where the difference is large enough. The only thing I'm really unsure of is how much efficiency I actually would accept dropping for the sake of higher burst. I guess i'll just have to progress more before really deciding while keeping items that I can swap based on what's needed.</div>

		<div id="post_message_581025">I’ve been running the numbers on using 3T2 all morning. And I have to agree with Thud00 that it provides a significant boost to the second and third jumps of your chain heal. <br>
<br>
Under the various scenarios I ran, it boosted my chain heal total by as much as 10.6%. Is that enough of an increase to make it worth while to run BWL for a few weeks (assuming you were like me and long ago vendored your T2 or perhaps are alliance and never did BWL as a shaman)? <br>
<br>
Assuming it really is worthwhile to get and equip T2, I worked up the following summary and generalization. Would appreciate feedback.<br>
<br>
You should wear three pieces of Tier 2 if the following statements are true:<br>
• Chain heal will be 90% of your healing for the fight<br>
• Your chain heal will normally hit all 3 targets. The biggest boost in healing is on the third jump.<br>
• You are in a 25-man raid<br>
• You do not lose any Tier 6 bonuses by equipping Tier 2. Tier 4 and Tier 5 set bonuses do not matter.<br>
• The best pieces of T2 to use are the bracers, gloves and boots.<br>
<br>
Assumptions:<br>
B+(M*B)+(M*M*B)<br>
Where B is the base heal on the first target, and M is 0.5, or 0.65 with the set bonus.<br>
<br>
Used the spreadsheets that Yekkom posted. All his calculations check out now.<br>
4pcT63pcT2 compared to 4pcT6: <br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302202034/http://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?k...hWHi77CA&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">http://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?k...hWHi77CA&amp;hl=en</a><br>
<br>
This next Google Doc spreadsheet has only a 3pc T2 compared to no T2:<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302202034/http://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?h...RD2ejLcYnLrQRA" target="_blank">http://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?h...RD2ejLcYnLrQRA</a><br>
<br>
In addition, it doesn’t matter how much plus healing you have. At any level, the 3T2 bonus will boost chain healing. However, until you get past Kara and into 25-man raids you won’t be chain healing enough to make the bonus worthwhile. Wearing the Tier 2 reduces your LHW and HW, which I find myself using frequently in 5 mans and 10 mans but rarely in raids.<br>
<br>
The downside of using T2 is that the first hit of your chain heal hits for less – about 200 less in the scenario I ran. However, your total chain heal will increase by about 500. And as we all know we get the most overhealing on the first target. Other healers also saw that person was low and targeted them. The beauty of chain heal is that the next two jumps go to the people who most need it. Often, they are players who took damage while you were casting. <br>
<br>
So far, we’ve been looking at how this will affect the healing done by chain heal. But I wanted to see the entire picture. What else would I lose by equipping the T2? How much Intellect or Stamina or mp5 would I sacrifice?<br>
<br>
Here’s one scenario I ran. Let’s say we have a shaman in the equivalent of T5 gear. <br>

Intellect: 464 (-31)<br>
Stamina 489 (-30)<br>
Avg Chain Heal (2962, 4887, 6139)<br>
<br>
Overall, you are not losing a lot of stam, intellect and mp5 for a 10% increase in healing power. The smaller mana pool really doesn’t matter and you can compensate for the lower mp5. So, I decided to run a second scenario. <br>
<br>
In the above scenario, we substituted the pieces of T2 that would have the least impact. This time I substitute the pieces of T2 that would have the greatest impact. Here you lose a meta gem as well.<br>

Stam: 442 (-77)<br>
Mp5: 140 (-49)<br>
Avg Chain Heal (2860, 4719, 5928)<br>
<br>
You boost your chain heal by 6%. However, you have now made some serious sacrifices in other areas. Losing 49 mp5 means you will probably have to have a shadow priest in your group. And losing 770 in health might make this gear difficult to wear for some fights where you need 10K or more health to survive. However, it’s still doable.<br>
<br>

#2 2100 healing (3T2) gives you an average chain heal of 3390, 5594 and 7027<br>
<br>
The result is a 10.6% increase in your chain heal.<br>
<br>
P.S. Also, anyone else take a look at the proc rate of <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=25901"><span><span class="bluename">[Insightful Earthstorm Diamond]</span></span></a>. I’d really like to nail down how often it procs.</div>

<br>
Right now I am using <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28590"><span><span class="purplename">[Ribbon of Sacrifice]</span></span></a> and <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=13503"><span><span class="purplename">[Alchemist's Stone]</span></span></a>.

My current gear has my healing at 1691 and my mp5 is around 120.  On the VR fight I had no trouble with mana, and the only fights I've seen where mana was an issue at all for me so far have been in ZA when we had a DPS light group and so we understood that the healers would have their mana taxed.  <br>
<br>
At this point I don't really find myself chain chugging mana pots in that many fights and I don't seem to have much trouble with mana efficiency, assuming I keep my Mana Spring down and WS up.  So would it be worth it to replace either of my current trinkets (I'm also looking to get <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=29376"><span><span class="purplename">[Essence of the Martyr]</span></span></a> to replace the Ribbon soon) with the Piston or another mp5 trinket, or would it be better to continue stacking more +healing, especially with the changes to WS in 2.3.2?</div>

I wouldn’t worry about losing out on the <a rel="nofollow" class="forumitemlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302202034/http://elitistjerks.com/./itemstats/updateitem.php?item=Fel%2BReaver%25E2%2580%2599s%2BPiston">[Fel Reaver’s Piston]</a>. I think the two trinkets you are currently using are superior. I did not like the Fel Feaver’s Piston because I noticed that the 500 heal over time usually got off only a tick or two before someone healed the player to full health. That leaves the 16 mp5 as the main benefit of the Piston, which is nothing too exciting. Don’t throw it away however. It’s nice for certain fights – such as the Maiden in Kara. You might also like it for 5 mans where you are the only healer.<br>
<br>
You may want to consider getting the <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30663"><span><span class="purplename">[Fathom-Brooch of the Tidewalker]</span></span></a> and using it on fights where you don’t use mana pots. I’m a big fan of the <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=13503"><span><span class="purplename">[Alchemist's Stone]</span></span></a>. However, you have to chain chug mana pots to get 40 mp5. If you use a pot only every 4 minutes (on average) it now returns 20 mp5. The Brooch returns at least 28 mp5 – if not more in some fights.<br>
<br>
I would ignore the people who are in love with the <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28190"><span><span class="bluename">[Scarab of the Infinite Cycle]</span></span></a>. It’s a trinket with a sexy proc and that is all some people can see. It is not better than Essence of the Martyr. However, the Scarab may be better than the Ribbon of Sacrifice. Both have +healing and I think the proc off Scarab would be more beneficial than the proc off Ribbon.</div>

Well, one of the reasons I was thinking about picking up an <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=29376"><span><span class="purplename">[Essence of the Martyr]</span></span></a> is for the on use in conjunction with ES.  I have a <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28190"><span><span class="bluename">[Scarab of the Infinite Cycle]</span></span></a> sitting in the bank, but have been unsure as to what the real value of that haste is considering I really don't have any other +haste on my gear.  I'll have to grab it this weekend and see how it goes with that.  <br>
<br>
And as for <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32496"><span><span class="purplename">[Memento of Tyrande]</span></span></a>...Well, my guild is just starting TK, and on my server there are two Horde guilds in BT, one at Illidan, and one Alliance guild which is stuck at RoS and can't get Archimonde down.  We're a little farther behind as a server.  I'm my guild raid leader and I've been trying to push us fairly quickly (we started Karazhan in early October and we're at VR now) but I'm not sure that I'll ever get to see Illidan.  </div>

</div>See, the point on <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=13503"><span><span class="purplename">[Alchemist's Stone]</span></span></a> is what I have been debating.  My problem is that I am only using a mana pot about once every 4 minutes.  I'm not coming close to chain chugging.  Adding in my Mana Spring, I was at 50% mana when we took down VR last night.  And that was my lowest point in the fight.  The only time I seem to really need them is for if I die and have to pop back up and get my mana back.  Otherwise I'm not using them that often.  Of course, when I do, it makes that trinket so nice.<br>
<br>
As for the <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33828"><span><span class="purplename">[Tome of Diabolic Remedy]</span></span></a> and <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30663"><span><span class="purplename">[Fathom-Brooch of the Tidewalker]</span></span></a>, well, we're having trouble right now with people consisently showing up (damned holidays!) for raids and so we're stuck in ZA, only through Akil'Zon and haven't actually started SSC yet.  We just started in TK for Loot Reaver two weeks ago.  But I'll definitely look into getting those.</div>

		<div id="post_message_583080">I'm a bit confused as to how you are learning new encounters and not chain chugging potions.  If you guys are struggling on ZA or 25 mans, then you should be spam healing.  Im not sure if your downranking or taking time out of the 5 second rule to keep such a high mana pool, but honestly you should be spamming heals.  If you guys are wiping, obviously there is someone there who needs healing.  All our restore shamans are alchs and all of them chain chug on new encounters.  I cant figure out what you would be doing that people are dying, yet your able to stay at 50% mana.  Alchemists stone is amazing(especially after you switch to fel mana pots).  <br>
<br>
If I'm completely wrong and your spamming and still able to be fine on mana, regem and reenchant your gear with plus healing.

		<div id="post_message_583104">The fact is on fights like void reaver, if people know what they're doing you don't need to do all that much healing. And if people don't know what they're doing, it'll be a wipe way before you have mana issues. If you're running without a shadow priest though you may have very different experience, as chain-chugging supers with alchemist stone is still not nearly what you would gain with even a not-so-great shadow priest. Of course pots+priest is better if there are actual people taking that damage so you can heal them - but on the early fights people who mess up so much to take unneeded damage will generally die anyway before a heal can land or if too many play like that the raid will probably wipe well before mana would become an issue.<br>
<br>
Remember mana stats are only valueable if people die more often because you were saving mana than how often they die because your heals weren't big/fast enough.</div>

</div>We're not struggling on the encounters.  We're struggling to have the people online to have a full raid.  The holidays are killing us.  Most of our guild are adults who are currently off visiting family or have parties they have to go to with their spouses and things of that nature.  We're doing fine in the actual progression.  We only started Kara in October, and we're through Loot Reaver at this point.  Maybe not the fastest progression, but still not too bad.<br>
<br>
As far as ZA goes, I've chain chugged mana pots on several of those fights as we're learning them.  When I'm healing in ZA, I pretty much constantly use Rank 8 HW on my tank now, while we have a druid throwing up HoT's for raid healing.  I will always use my Mana Tide before a pot, so that it goes on cooldown and can come back up again later if needed.  We aren't really having a problem with people dying.    <br>
<br>
On VR last night, the only people that died were ranged who didn't avoid the Arcane Orbs.  That's it.  It's certainly possible that as time goes on and we get into more difficult fights, and more of our guild returns from the holidays and we start progressing further, that I'll need to chain pots.  That's why I went potion spec alchemist to begin with.  So far it just doesn't seem to be an issue.

				<div style="font-style:italic">We're not struggling on the encounters.  We're struggling to have the people online to have a full raid.  The holidays are killing us.  Most of our guild are adults who are currently off visiting family or have parties they have to go to with their spouses and things of that nature.  We're doing fine in the actual progression.  We only started Kara in October, and we're through Loot Reaver at this point.  Maybe not the fastest progression, but still not too bad.<br>
<br>
As far as ZA goes, I've chain chugged mana pots on several of those fights as we're learning them.  When I'm healing in ZA, I pretty much constantly use Rank 8 HW on my tank now, while we have a druid throwing up HoT's for raid healing.  I will always use my Mana Tide before a pot, so that it goes on cooldown and can come back up again later if needed.  We aren't really having a problem with people dying.    <br>
<br>
On VR last night, the only people that died were ranged who didn't avoid the Arcane Orbs.  That's it.  It's certainly possible that as time goes on and we get into more difficult fights, and more of our guild returns from the holidays and we start progressing further, that I'll need to chain pots.  That's why I went potion spec alchemist to begin with.  So far it just doesn't seem to be an issue.  That's why I was asking about the relative value of the <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30619"><span><span class="purplename">[Fel Reaver's Piston]</span></span></a>.</div>

</div>During what bosses are you spamming Rank 8 HW on the tank on Zul'Aman? I also raid Zul'Aman with a Resto Druid, and I find that doing so is quite pointless because Lifebloom is just so powerful on the tanks. I use Chain heal to heal the raid and I use chain heal to heal the tank in Zul'Aman. Perhaps you could elaborate on specific encounters?<br>
<br>
What is your strategy against Void Reaver - more specifically: what do you and the melee do? During Void Reaver I stand right in between Void Reaver's legs, pretty much right under him and spam chain heal on the melee and anyone else who happens to be there as well (other healers). It's not my responsibility to heal the ranged, and I'm constantly spamming chain heal nonstop. I feel that it is a very effective use of a Resto shaman. Does your guild have you do something different?</div>

		<div id="post_message_583473">There isnt a single fight I use mana potions on. Had the same number in my bags for months. You dont have to use them if you are geared at the right level. If you are wiping its because people are making mistakes and dieing before heals land. I dont recall any wipes being caused by all the healers being oom. You cant reduce healers any more either, Each heal takes a fixed time and that will lead to wipes since you simply dont have the time to get around to them all. One healer with 50k +heal and 10k MP5 can still only heal one guy at once.<br>
<br>
For the voidreaver fight dont stand out with the ranged. You job is to stand directly under him and spam chain heals on the melee (both rogues and tanks). The rogues should never leave melee but eat the damage and you will keep them all up with CH. The ranged must not come close and orb the melee of course. You simply lose too much cast time if you run around dodging orbs. Its far easier to heal up the damage on yourself and be chain healing 100% of the time. You will simply own the healing meters. A couple of chain healers does almost all the healing the fight needs. Leave healing of the ranged to other people like paladins that only have single target heals. If you cant sustain the mana then downrank, and only if you are actualy losing people due to you inability to top them up should you uprank and quaff potions.</div>

You can swap relics during spell casts to enhance the effect of spells with casting times without invoking the GCD e.g. However, you first need to start casting the spell and then change relics. The spell’s plus healing will be calculated based on when you finish casting, not when you start.<br>

</div>You're right, those 7 points are better used elsewhere. With your mana regen, reducing totem costs isn't an issue, and it's generally accepted that it's better to use the points from Reincarnation elsewhere that will prevent you from dying in the first place.<br>
<br>
I heal ZA with 1610 healing and 135 unbuffed MP5, which is quite enough when supported by some potions. 8-0-53 spec, and Healing Grace is maxxed out for me.<br>
<br>
Quick question, and sorry if it has been answered before: How much MP5 does the Enamored Water Spirit work out to? I still have it banked, and due to some rather poor luck I'm wondering if it'll be worth equipping.</div>

</div>You should vendor the <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=20503"><span><span class="bluename">[Enamored Water Spirit]</span></span></a>. To expand upon Binkenstein's post, even with talents, the most it will restore is 33 to 34 mana every 2 seconds. This works out to about 408 mana every three minutes or 11.33 mp5. It does not stack with Mana Spring. Granted, it does restore 11.33 mp5 to everyone in your party but in most groups your Mana Spring Totem gives everyone enough mana.<br>

</div>I disagree. For two points I gain an extra 20% health/mana and 20 minute shorter cooldown on my reincarnate. As I've said multiple times earlier, these two talent points at the very worst provide a 20% extra mana buffer for if you go OOM, kill yourself on purpose, and continue healing. <br>
<br>
As for what talents to get rid of in the Restoration tree to gain Elemental Warding, here's what I did:<br>
1) Totemic Focus is the first to go, I only had 3 points in there to begin with, so this only gave me 3 points to put into Elemental.<br>
2) Focused Mind is also a relatively easy choice, seeing as there's no encounter in Hyjal/BT where silence is an issue aside from Azgalor, but his silence can be dealt with using Shadow Resist. Another 3 points.<br>
3) Two more points left. Here I made the choice between Imp. Reincarnation and 2 points in Tidal Focus. Thinking it over, I realized that 2 points in Tidal Focus is just 2% spell crit - a stat that is of extremely little importance to us, seeing as the majority of the time we spend in 25-mans, we're raid healing and not tank healing. In the end I decided that Improved Reincarnation is simply much more powerful and useful than 2% spell crit, so I went with that.</div>

</div>Up until now, you made some good choices. Our crits are what procs Ancestral Healing, which boosts our target's armor by 25%. Tidal Mastery goes hand-in-hand with this ability. Don't think that because our crits don't reduce casting time or contribute to mana regeneration that crit is of little importance to us. <br>
<br>
But let's say you are raid healing and the raid is taking no physical damage (pretty frequent occurance). Take a look at how much 2% crit boosts your healing during a night of raiding and then compare that with the healing you are able to do with 20% more mana upon reincarnation. Let's say your mana pool is 10,000. That means you get an extra 2,000 mana when you pop. That's enough to cast 5 chain heals if you downrank. Now, compare that to critting 2% more often over a night -- or a week -- or raiding.</div>

</div>Sorry I didn't catch this sooner, but I've been out of touch during the holidays.  To answer your questions:<br>
<br>
Right now we're through Nalorrakk and Akil'Zon in ZA.  On Nalorrakk I spam rank 8 Healing Wave on whatever tank is tanking.  I'll through up a rank 4 Chain Heal right after the switch for tanks.  On Akil'Zon I spam rank 4 Chain Heal to heal the raid.  For VR, I am exactly how you said, standing underneath VR and spamming CH on the melee.  I wasn't healing the range at all, they had other healers for that, because no one could do more for the melee than me.</div>

		<div id="post_message_585763">I want to get some more discussion going about Haste. So far, it’s disappointed me and a lot of other resto shamans. Here’s my hypothesis: Haste does nothing for healing if you only have a little. However, once you reach the “tipping point” it becomes a powerful stat.<br>
<br>
Here are my assumptions: <br>
<br>
1) Haste only benefits you during “spam” healing or when casting back-to-back heals.<br>
2) You have to spam heals for at least as long as it takes to get your first extra heal from the haste effect<br>
3) Haste does not benefit healing classes in the same way as it does DPS classes<br>
4) Using large amounts of haste will require the presence of a shadow priest<br>
5) We ignore the benefit of a heal reaching someone faster and saving them from death. It’s a great benefit, but just too hard to quantify.<br>
<br>
Here’s the question: If these assumptions are true, at what point do you first begin to see substantial benefit from haste? (See chart below)<br>
<br>
Let’s say you have enough haste to cast 5% faster. You have to cast chain heal 20 times before you get an extra heal from the faster cast time. And if you spam heals non-stop that’s 47.5 seconds into a fight. I’m going to say the benefit from haste at this point is a big, fat zero.<br>
<br>
Now, let’s say you have enough haste to cast a chain heal in 2.0 seconds (which would take 20% haste). You would get an extra cast after 10 seconds. I can’t count the number of times that I spam heal for 10, 15 or even 20 seconds. If I could get off six chain heals instead of five in the same time, my healing would probably go up 20%.<br>
<br>
So, if you have 5% haste it does no good. If you have 20%, it a powerful stat (assuming you have a shadow priest or two in your group to keep you from going OOM). <br>
<br>
So when do you first begin to see some benefit from haste? With 11% haste, you get that first extra cast around the 20-second mark. That’s quite a bit more useful than 47.5 seconds. Anyone have that much haste? What has your experience healing been?<br>

If you wore every piece of healing gear with haste, you could get 372 haste rating or 23.6% haste. If you wore healing gear plus DPS gear with haste, you could get up to 414 haste rating, or 26.25%. It’s a little dizzying to think of what it would be like to cast all the time as if Bloodlust/Heroism were up.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Up until now, you made some good choices. Our crits are what procs Ancestral Healing, which boosts our target's armor by 25%. Tidal Mastery goes hand-in-hand with this ability. Don't think that because our crits don't reduce casting time or contribute to mana regeneration that crit is of little importance to us. <br>
<br>
But let's say you are raid healing and the raid is taking no physical damage (pretty frequent occurance). Take a look at how much 2% crit boosts your healing during a night of raiding and then compare that with the healing you are able to do with 20% more mana upon reincarnation. Let's say your mana pool is 10,000. That means you get an extra 2,000 mana when you pop. That's enough to cast 5 chain heals if you downrank. Now, compare that to critting 2% more often over a night -- or a week -- or raiding.</div>

	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>You make some good points. There are certainly quite a few encounters in the game where the raid does get jacked quite horribly, and you are spamming chain heal desperately to try to keep everyone alive. I'm going to go ahead and make a bold claim in saying that during these times and these times <i>alone</i> do you truly appreciate crits on your heals - the rest of the time there is a very high chance that those crits just turn into overheal. However, at the same time, you, as a member of the raid, are also very much in danger of dying at these times. The probability of you dying is something that is very difficult to describe -- but it should be said that even the most experienced raider can make mistakes. Ever miss a heal on yourself because the healthbars of other raid members were much more dynamic and interesting? 2% extra spell crit won't save you from these mistakes, and it certainly won't save you from the plethora of other horrible things that may happen to you because of someone else's mistakes. That said, there are a great number of mistakes that can be made during the course of a fight that do not call for an immediate wipe. Being able to Ankh with a decent amount of health and mana is godlike in these situations, and critting 2% more often over an entire year's worth of raiding still isn't enough to replace that.</div>

</div>This observation is true, but you are ignoring the other way to look at it:<br>
<br>
If you have enough haste to cast 5% faster, and do not sacrifice a significant amount of +heal to do so, you are also able to top the raid off 5% faster. Even if you don't cast that extra heal you get from your spell haste, you did what you had to do in less time.<br>
<br>
Hard to quantify, yes, but I'm sure we can agree that there exists situations in which such an ability can be very useful. <br>
<br>
Also, on a slightly less important note: spell haste really helps our performance on healing meters. While this doesn't really matter very much in terms of raid success, if you already have everything on farm, what harm is there in trying to gear for the meters?</div>

If you must have improved reincarnation, then yea spell crit is the obvious place.<br>
<br>
But you dont need it. Almost every time you die its a wipe anyhow. If its not you can pop and drink a mana pot or MT. Spam CH1 if you have to. We dont heal on our mana pool but on our regen. Having a few more mana doesnt matter much. There are times when you are healing simply because of the armor buff on the tank and you want that crit.<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
Thats an odd way to look at haste. Most fights I am spamming non stop. 5% haste is 5% more healing if I have the same +heal. Clearly you are not spamming CH5 or HW12 for long unless you have an SP. 47s doesnt matter I am spamming much longer than that. <br>
<br>
Lag is a factor on how much you can gain, as is the spell and your current stats. <br>
<br>
Haste is very expensive you have to give up a lot of stats to get it. Its not valueless however. Even 5% haste has a value in terms of +heal.</div>

Gift of the Naaru<br>
40 yd range<br>
1.5 sec cast<br>

Heals the target of (Level * 15 + 35) damage over 15 sec.<br>

-Ticks 5 times, once every 3 seconds. Heals 217 damage a tick. (once again, before +healing)<br>
-Receives 100% of your +healing over the 15 second duration.<br>
-Costs no mana, and can be used to get out of the FSR for full mana regen.<br>
-Counts as a holy spell, and can be used while locked out of the nature school. As a holy spell, it cannot be made instant by Nature's Swiftness.<br>
-Gains no benefit from Purification or Healing Focus. Unsure if Healing Grace effects it. (anyone care to confirm/deny?)<br>
-As a HoT, it obviously cannot crit, and thus cannot proc Ancestral Healing. <br>
<br>
I've found it useful for casting before a silence or stun/incapacitate, such as with Murmur's Touch, Nalorakk's Deafening Roar, Reverberation/Stoned on Gruul, and Maiden of Virtue's Repentance. If the tank isn't in need of a big heal and you know that one of these is coming, it can lessen the pain of inactivity during this period. I've also used it on lifetapping warlocks, myself if I'm a little low but healing myself isn't urgent, individual ranged dps that aren't close to anyone else for Chain Heal, and on anyone if I want to conserve mana. The cast time makes it a pain to use in mobility fights, but it's a rather short cast time to be honest.</div>

		<div id="post_message_586037">I'd agree that my main use of Gift of the Naaru tends to be on Warlocks. I'll keep an eye out for the tap and drop Gift on them at the time, or if we're not hectic I'll throw a quick 'Regen - Tap Now' whisper in their direction.<br>
There's a macro out there for whispering your target which I keep meaning to set up for that.<br>
<br>
A couple of the more savvy Warlocks in our team also like to run in closer to the melee group before tapping where it's practical to do so, that way they catch the free tail-end bounces off Chain Heal to fuel the Lifetap.<br>
<br>
edit : In terms of performance, I'm getting around 2200 from GotN at the 1700-1800 healing level, which makes it a fairly poor heal except for use in very specific circumstances as you're losing the chance to cast a superior heal in its place. The only real benefits are that it's free, and that it isn't affected by any lockdown on your nature spells. As it's only 5 ticks, I find that timing it to be used effectively on fights like Bear is very difficult.</div>

</div>Very easy formula for which totem to use. It is as follows:<br>
<br>
If you have mana problems (no spriest) use the reduced cost totems. If you have mana-a-plenty, use the +healing totems. Are you raid healing? Use the chain heal totems. Are you on the tank or mostly casting [lesser] healing wave? Use the [lesser] healing wave totems.<br>
<br>
Offtopic... I'm not sure what the bias against haste procs I've seen in this thread is about TBQH. I would say the number of fights where I'm raid healing and almost continually casting are in the majority (w/ the obvious exceptions).

</div>The amount added to healing from relics is applied the same way +healing is applied to your spells. <br>
<br>
If you have purification and healing way (assuming you aren't down ranking) it would be<br>
e.g.  for Regrowth the its calculated as (base healing wave + additional healing* 3/3.5) *1.1*.06X<br>
where X is the number of healing way stacks.<br>
<br>
So assuming you have 1500 +healing then you add the additional pus healing from the relic for healing wave then throw it in the calculation.  (base + (1588)(3/3.5) )*1.1 *.06X <br>
So yes it does benefit from purification and healing way.</div>

</div>If you use some of the casting &amp; relic switching macros posted in this thread, you can use both of those particular relics.  The question for PVE essentially then becomes whether you want reduced mana or more healing for the spell you're casting.  As a previous poster suggested, this is probably best decided by individual circumstance, and how frequently you find yourself going out of mana.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Very easy formula for which totem to use. It is as follows:<br>
<br>
If you have mana problems (no spriest) use the reduced cost totems. If you have mana-a-plenty, use the +healing totems. Are you raid healing? Use the chain heal totems. Are you on the tank or mostly casting [lesser] healing wave? Use the [lesser] healing wave totems.<br>
<br>
Offtopic... I'm not sure what the bias against haste procs I've seen in this thread is about TBQH. I would say the number of fights where I'm raid healing and almost continually casting are in the majority (w/ the obvious exceptions). And a large portion of my casts are 2.5s so getting a half-cast or 2.0s CH off is a godsend in some cases and just plain nice in others. My 2c.</div>

You don't have to choose between them.  Totem swapping can goof up the GCD if you spam instead of casting at the proper time, but it's not bad if you get used to using Quartz or similar for a cast bar.

</div>Nice one.<br>
<br>
The point though is, although this was more a personal question, it applies anyway. That is, whilst i don't run out of mana generally, through judicious use of downranking, would i/anyone gain more benefit by using a reduced mana cost relic thereby enabling a higher rank of heal. It's not so simple as 'if you don't run out of mana stack +heal', especially considering Chain Heal uses the largest chunk of mana. Reduced mana cost on heals will enable higher ranks to be used, and therefore, higher effective +heal and more healing.</div>

 10 casts per minute you get 16.667 mana/5    10X20/12<br>

 15 cast per minute 25 mana/5 (equals a resto flask)  15X20/12<br>

 24 cast per minute 40 mana/5  24X20/12 <br>
<br>
 To do 24 casts per minute (still dropping totems and watershield as needed)  is not possible without either a high haste rating (300?) or bloodlust up as a 2.5 second cast averages around 3.0 seconds from my experiences.<br>
<br>
  My last VR fight (healing inside four assigned targets including myself with no shadow priest in group) was 122 chainheals with 284 hits in 7 minutes 18 seconds time for 16.7 cast per minute which equals 27.83 mana/5     16.7X20/12  My overheal was 17% approximately. <br>

		<div id="post_message_586828">The thing with downranking, is that if it provides enough HPS you're not really going to uprank if you have more mana. However on shitty scenarios when the raid takes a huge burst, wether predictable or unpredictable, you probably want max rank so they don't die, and want that max rank to heal for as much as possible.<br>
<br>
So it's not impossible to never have mana problems due to downranking while still benefiting from higher HPS.<br>
Not to mention higher HPS also means you'll need to uprank less often, saving even more mana - the effect from this isn't huge but it's there and gives HPS additional efficiency value (as in, +healing gives additional efficiency due to more of your spells being downrankable on top of making them simply more heal/mana, and even haste makes you not need to uprank as much). Again the HPS-&gt;efficiency conversion is generally a small secondary benefit from HPS but it's there and shouldn't be ignored.</div>

As we expected, the first hit of chain heal is weaker but the set bonus gives the second and third jumps added power. My first jump of chain heal is under 3000, while Khairis does well over 3000. However, my second jump heals for 1800 and the third for 1200 while Khairis’ second jump heals for 1600 and the third for 800.<br>
<br>
I'm sure Thud00 is reading this saying "I told you so." You were right. I'm impressed enough just from this one fight that I think it's worth putting some enchants on the pieces of T2 I have. I want to get a whole raid's worth of data before I propose to my guild that we add BWL to the schedule.</div>

		<div id="post_message_589796">I did some testing with haste yesterday. The sample size is small so please keep that in mind when drawing conclusions. <br>
<br>
I was wrong about a small amount of haste not boosting your healing. And once again Thud00 was correct. It does increase the healing done – just not as much as I was expecting. I wore gear with 6% haste and saw my healing increase by 1.55%. The faster casting time was offset by the gear having less +healing and spell crit. The haste effect was also reduced by lag and by the test  lasting only 1 minute. <br>
<br>
With 6% haste, it theoretically takes 39 seconds to get an extra cast. Because I ended the test after 1 minute, I didn’t receive any benefit from the haste for the last 21 seconds. So in a raid situation, the haste benefit would be greater as long as you spam chain heal and never stop – not even for a few seconds.<br>

</div>Lag had a bigger impact on haste than I had expected. For example, theoretically with 6% haste I should be able to cast my 2.5 second chain heal in 2.35 seconds. However, in reality it took me 2.67 seconds to cast (versus 2.8 seconds with no haste). This was standing still just spamming the spell on myself. In most raid situations, a shaman spamming chain heal will probably cast the spell every 3 seconds. So if you had 6% haste, it would take you 47 seconds to cast the first extra heal, not the theoretical 39 seconds. You would have to spam cast for 47 seconds. If you stopped for even a few seconds, it would basically reset the clock on when you benefit from haste.<br>
<br>
Does this mean that the benefit of haste is reduced by 20% if it takes you 3.0 seconds to spam chain heal in a raid versus the theoretical cast time of 2.5 seconds due to the long period of time it will take you to get the extra heal?<br>

</div>I also did some testing with the <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28190"><span><span class="bluename">[Scarab of the Infinite Cycle]</span></span></a>. As expected, the results were unpredictable. It really depended on when it procced – even while spam casting. Sometimes only one heal got the full benefit of the haste. However, I think it would be the best trinket to wear with a Spell Haste set. It’s a shame there’s no helm with spell haste. It would be the perfect place to use a <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=25893"><span><span class="bluename">[Mystical Skyfire Diamond]</span></span></a>. It is probably worthwhile for shaman to try to get two helms and put <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=25901"><span><span class="bluename">[Insightful Earthstorm Diamond]</span></span></a> in their main helm and MSD in a second helm to use as part of a spell haste set.<br>

</div>* These were tests where the trinket procced at just the right time. Without the lucky proc, I was unable to squeeze in more heals than without the trinket .<br>
<br>
I also did some tests to see if there was any difference between mashing your heal button and clicking it well before the cast was finished. It looks like mashing the key is slightly more advantageous. You really can’t go wrong mashing the key. If you don’t want to abuse your keyboard or mouse, you run the risk of either starting the next heal too early (and it doesn’t go through) or too late. It’s not a huge difference but there did appear to be a difference.</div>

During High Warlord Naj'entus and other such fights though, "just the right time" is essentially "all the time".</div>

</div>You forget to mention one very, very important factor. You had a shadow priest in your group. Therefore mana wasn't an issue. In those situations, MSD is a great meta gem. The faster spell casting definitely helps. However, there will be times when you don't have a shadow priest and you will still have to spam chain heal. That's why IED is the better overall choice. <br>
<br>
The armory isn't working again so I can't see how many other pieces of T6 you have. Obviously, the set bonuses are amazing so you always want to keep them. But if you previously had the <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32241"><span><span class="purplename">[Helm of Soothing Currents]</span></span></a> consider putting the MSD in that helm to wear when you have a shadow priest. Excluding set bonuses, the T6 helm and Soothing Currents are very comparable. Then, you can wear the T6 helm on fights where you don't get a shadow priest. If you can manage set bonuses without the helm, you can have the best of both meta gems.<br>
<br>
EDIT: I forgot to answer your question about the Scarab. Yes, I was spamming chain heal on myself so it didn't have a chance to bounce to other targets. However, it really doesn't matter because of the 45 second cooldown on the trinket. It did proc during every test. Sometimes the timing was better than others.<br>
<br>
You can see the same thing yourself on the Naj'entus fight. You get some nice procs but then both the trinket and meta gem proc at the same time -- so you only get to cast one super fast heal. <br>

		<div id="post_message_590169">High Warlord Naj'entus is a fight where we give all of our healers shadow priests. It's a fight where the raid is taking heavy predictable damage, and therefore every healer we have is going to be spending mana at a rate much faster than he/she can regenerate on his/her own. If you ever go to Naj'entus without a shadow priest, you will go OOM, and your <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=25901"><span><span class="bluename">[Insightful Earthstorm Diamond]</span></span></a> is not going to prevent that. I suppose you could stack as much MP5 as you can possibly get on your gear with 4 Mp5, but it's not really worth it just for one fight.<br>
<br>
In my experiences with the MSD and the Scarab, the MSD has a high proc rate but an internal cooldown, while the Scarab not only has a slightly lower proc rate but also an internal cooldown. That is to say, the MSD will proc pretty reliably whenever its' internal cooldown is up, but the Scarab will not.<br>
<br>
I'm going to go back and discuss a little bit about the Improved Reincarnation VS. 2% Spell Crit argument. I'd like to say that healing isn't DPS, and long run averages are not a very good way of discussing healing strategies. Calculating how much I would have healed over a week of raiding with an extra 2% spell crit is something, but comparing it to how much healing I could output with 20% extra mana from improved reincarnation is meaningless. That 20% extra mana is used for clutch situations and could potentially save the entire raid from a wipe. Situations in which this happens are few and far between, but the value of such an ability is WAY higher than 2% spell crit over however many months of raiding anyone happens to do.</div>

Totem swapping can goof up the GCD if you spam instead of casting at the proper time, but it's not bad if you get used to using Quartz or similar for a cast bar.

</div>A couple things to note on that. First, is that for a mouseover macro, in order for self-cast heals to work you would need to add an additional condition to that to the effect of [modifier:alt, target=player] otherwise attempting to self-cast using alt will not work properly. Second is a bit of personal preference, but typically I would move mouseover to be the first choice for healing targets. Makes things a bit simpler when you want to keep a closer eye on a tank (or anyone really, as your target), use mouseover to heal whoever needs it at the time, then mouseover blank space to heal the person you're focusing on.</div>

</div>We don't have any such breakdown and we've been doing Naj'entus for months. Perhaps we should, but we don't. I'm the only resto shaman in our raid most of the time, and I'm spamming chain heal nonstop on the melee. Naj'entus is also a fight where the more melee you bring, the more damage they all take. How many melee do you bring? <br>
<br>
Of the fights you've listed, Gurtogg Bloodboil is the only one that's long enough for me to request a shadow priest. Illidari Council is really long as well, but the raid does not take predictable heavy damage in that fight so I don't really know why you listed it. <br>
<br>
In any case, if I happen to not get a shadow priest during an encounter that is both long and heavy on mana usage, all I have to do is swap in an <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=13503"><span><span class="purplename">[Alchemist's Stone]</span></span></a> and be more diligent in drinking my Mana Potions every 2 min.

</div>We often bring between 4-6 melee to Naj'entus. If there is 5 or less, we split them into 2 groups, if there is 6 we split them into three. One is behind the boss, one is behind right, one is behind left. Each of those groups get a healer assigned to them. We only run one resto shaman, the other melee healer is usually our CoH priest and if we have 3 groups then another priest or pally. Then 2 druids get placed on MT healing and the remaining healers (3-4 of them) get 2-3 people each to heal plus themselves. That pretty much takes care of the healing requirements for it.</div>

		<div id="post_message_590326">My personal opinion on haste procs is negative. You simply cant control when they proc. Building on that basis is like building to rely on crits. Works well when it happens but when it doesnt you got problems. Healing is about dependability. If you cant manage, you bring in an extra healer. Anything where success depends on that proc is too close to call and you are much better off with an extra healer. The haste proc isnt free you are paying for it with other stats that you could use more reliably.<br>
<br>
Najentus isnt that hard. When no SP I manage just fine to heal, may finish low but wont use a pot. We get him in 3 bubbles. With an SP tonight finished on full mana. As your SP get better they return more and more mana to you. <br>
<br>
The most mana intensive fight is council since its so long. I usualy have an SP and maintain mana spamming rank 5 CH on the Gothios tank as fast as I can. I am getting that much mana back combined with WS/totems. If the SP stops feeding me I drop down to spamming rank 4 CH. You should be spamming because you want a heal half cast if he takes a burst. You should be on him because your jumps heals the consecration damage on the rogues. Put the paladins on the raid, they are only good for single targets.<br>
<br>
This brings us back to another post about the 2% crit. You are not only losing the healing. You are losing the armor buff on the tank. This is very useful. You shouldnt be dieing often to need improved reincarnation. If you die once every couple of weeks you can drop an MT or pop a pot when you get up. The SP will have you to full in no time. Something is very wrong if you are dieing that often that you find it useful, maybe not enough hp.<br>
<br>
We always run with 2 resto shamans and usualy 1 enhancement to do the WF. They 2 restos are put in 2 groups with the 2 SP and mages. We feed the SP mana too from our totems. The ones least likely to get an SP are the locks and hunters. They can manage well enough on their own. If an SP is away for a raid then mana is tighter so you still need enough MP5 on your gear to cope.</div>

</div>While it's true that you can't control when haste procs happen, wearing and MSD and a Scarab does not really detract from your "dependability" as a healer. I wouldn't call the <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=25901"><span><span class="bluename">[Insightful Earthstorm Diamond]</span></span></a> dependable or reliable either, the only thing that's truly reliable about that is the 12 intellect, which is really not all that. The mana regen the IED gives you is really not that strong, I was getting an average somewhere in the region of 20-22 Mp5 from it. When compared to the sheer power of the half cast MSD, it truly pales in comparison - especially because I'm not running out of mana without it.<br>

You shouldnt be dieing often to need improved reincarnation. If you die once every couple of weeks you can drop an MT or pop a pot when you get up. The SP will have you to full in no time.

</div>I agree that the armor buff on the tank is very useful. That is the only thing I regret losing when I choose to sacrifice 2% spell crit. However, it still does not make 2% worth more than Improved Reincarnation IMO. The only fight in which I should be healing a tank is, as you say the Illidari Council fight, and that's just one fight. Loss of 2% spell crit for Ancestral Fortitude on just one fight is just not a big deal. I am not saying I am dying often enough to "need" improved reincarnation. I'm saying the bonuses on improved reincarnation even if you use it just once a week far outweighs a measly 2% spell crit.</div>

Note about gemming - if you're gemming for 9 heal 2 mp5 over 18 healing gems even in red slots, why would you ever use 9 healing 4 int in a yellow slot? Since you already decided that 9 heal 2 mp5 is better than 18 healing, you've decided 9 healing is better than 2 mp5. However if you socket 9 heal 4 int over 4 int 2 mp5 it shows you decided the complete opposite.... This is something I see a lot of people doing but why would you ever sacrifice 9 healing to gain 2 mp5 in one place where in another you sacrifice 2 mp5 to gain back 9 healing?<br>
<br>
Excusing it as "well I prefer 18 healing 4 int 2 mp5 over 9 healing 4 int 4 mp5 becuase I don't need so much mp5 but need the healing" just doesn't make any sense. It's near impossible to be at the point where 9 healing and 2 mp5 are so close that they're worth mixing - as in the change of 2 mp5 will definitely not turn it into a 9 healing &gt; 2 mp5 all of a sudden whe you pick the next gem. Heck even a change of 50 mp5 would be unlikely to change it.<br>
<br>
So for people socketing 9 heal 2 mp5 in red sockets and 9 healing 4 int in yellow sockets, you should probably rethink what you're trying to achieve here...</div>

</div>Question: is there an in-between point for having no mana, and having too much mana regen?<br>
I'd prefer to have excess regen so I don't have to worry about mana conservation. If you can gear so that you just run out of mana at the end of the fight while using all available cooldowns, then I'd be mightily impressed.<br>
<br>
Look at it from a flip side. The more mana you have available, the longer/harder you can heal (if you're downranking and saying that you don't need mana regen, I don't think it counts, nor if you have a shadow priest).</div>

</div>You can say that about every healing stat. More +healing is wasted if nobody dies and your heals heal for enough for you to not need to cast into oomness. Haste is useless if your HPS is higher than the boss's DPS and you always get a heal in between attacks.<br>
<br>
At the end, when shit hit the fans, haste, healing and more mana will always help (depending on what kind of shit, of course - if the fight just lasted longer haste wouldn't really help and if some people just took random burst but you still had lots of mana left mana didn't help, but you get the idea), while random haste procs will not always help, no matter what kind of "shit hits the fan" situation you run into. Sometimes they will, but not always.<br>
<br>
Are random haste procs useless? No, but I find the above making their value greatly reduced compared to their maximum possible potential, while constant haste/healing/mana will not drop in value in the emergencies for which they're useful for (with healing being useful for all kinds of emergencies as it incerases both HPS and efficiency).</div>

</div>I pretty much agree.  If you're gemming for straight +heal then most slots should be Teardrop.  If you're gemming with blue gems and want to focus on mp5 you get the most from using Royal and Dazzling where appropriate.  The thing is, though, that last patch Shamans gained a boatload of extra mp5, and not everyone will want to regem all their gear, especially when the blue Royal/Dazzling have a "bonus" .5 mp5 per gem and allow you to hit all sorts of nice socket bonuses.  New gems, however, should be Luminous since mp5 just isn't nearly as hard to come by.<br>
<br>
To recap:<br>
Old strategy = Royal or Dazzling in every slot to get all the set bonuses and bonus (non-budgeted) mp5.  If you are in a lot of blues, even with the new water shield, you should probably still follow this.<br>
New strategy = all Teardrop, or Royal in blues and Luminous in yellows when you want the socket bonus.  Royal shouldn't go in red sockets anymore.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">My personal opinion on haste procs is negative. You simply cant control when they proc. Building on that basis is like building to rely on crits. Works well when it happens but when it doesnt you got problems. Healing is about dependability. If you cant manage, you bring in an extra healer. Anything where success depends on that proc is too close to call and you are much better off with an extra healer. The haste proc isnt free you are paying for it with other stats that you could use more reliably.<br>
<br>
This brings us back to another post about the 2% crit. You are not only losing the healing. You are losing the armor buff on the tank. This is very useful. You shouldnt be dieing often to need improved reincarnation. If you die once every couple of weeks you can drop an MT or pop a pot when you get up. The SP will have you to full in no time. Something is very wrong if you are dieing that often that you find it useful, maybe not enough hp.</div>

</div>I do feel there is a time and place for gems and trinkets with haste procs. I think they are an excellent addition to your spell haste set. I have begun wearing haste gear whenever I am with a shadow priest and I know the fight will not last long enough to burn through all my mana. I really like using the <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28190"><span><span class="bluename">[Scarab of the Infinite Cycle]</span></span></a> for those fights because the passive +70 heal on the trinket makes up for some of the lost +healing on the haste gear. I normally use a mana regen trinket that doesn’t have +heal.<br>
<br>
Let me add another criteria for using a spell haste set: There is little chance of your shadow priest dieing. By wearing this gear, you are dependent upon another player (not my favorite situation). For example, I will not wear spell haste for Teron Gorefiend. My shadow priest could easily be chosen for Shadow of Death. And while I would hope that we have a combat rez or soul stone available, I don’t want to take a chance on something going wrong in such a healing intensive fight.<br>
<br>
Now, my guild hasn’t cleared Hyjal or Black Temple so a fight like Gorefiend is still quite challenging for us. I would take a chance on wearing spell haste gear in TK or SSC. I feel comfortable enough in most of those fights that even if I lost my shadow priest, I would still be ok on mana and healing (partly because of all the gear from BT and Hyjal). <br>
<br>
I haven’t encountered a fight yet where I needed the spell haste in order to keep people alive. Perhaps there is one later on in BT or in the Sunwell. So far, spell haste has been icing on the cake. I only use it once I have everything else I need to successfully heal a fight.</div>

</div>And Illidan. There is no need for CH apart from P2. You should be spamming the tank with what you can maintain. Traps are not always close or accessable. When he enrages he can be hitting the tank for 13k. Having 25% more armor from you is a big deal in turning that into more manageable damage. Put a pala onto parasite damage all they can do is single target spam but they dont give armor.<br>
<br>
Say we have 2 shamans landing every 2.5s, so a heal lands every 1.25s. We each have 15% crit and AF lasts 15s. So we can calculate the uptime of AF as 1 - (1-0.15)^(15/1.25) = 85%. If we dropped to 13% crit it becomes 81%. If we switched to 1.5s casts we get 96%. The difference between 85% and 81% may seem small, but if you reverse it you see the tank spends 26% more time without AF which is significant.<br>
<br>
The pala can heal more hps but the idea is to stop burst that kills the tank before heals can land. Most of the palas superior hps is wasted on a full hp tank until wham the tank is on 25%, then all hell breaks loose.<br>
<br>
I know some guilds use CH on bloodboil tanks since you have 3 tanks each taking dot damage it lends itself well enough to 3 jumps the same could be used on Shahraz where you have 3 tanks in the front. A CoH priest would be important in what strat you use since they can take over your raid healing role. Depends on what strategies you guild uses.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">And Illidan. There is no need for CH apart from P2. You should be spamming the tank with what you can maintain. Traps are not always close or accessable. When he enrages he can be hitting the tank for 13k. Having 25% more armor from you is a big deal in turning that into more manageable damage. Put a pala onto parasite damage all they can do is single target spam but they dont give armor.<br>

</div>For council it depends.  If the tank is not in any danger I tend to chain heal since melee is frequently tanking aoe dmg and can use the heals.  So teh tank get the biggest but melee get the next 2 smaller jumps.  I will also throw up a rank 7 healing wave to keep healing way up.  When the tank spikes I switch back to HW12 till I feel he is safe then go back to chain heals.  I find its a good way to spam the tank but also get the melee some healing.<br>
<br>
Illidan is def one where I spam Healing Wave and really there isn't that much to do other outside of phase 2.  What else would you do with all your mana?  We also don't use traps half the time due their poor placement so I completely agree with the importance of AF and spamming the tank.<br>
<br>
For sharaz its usually a mix of heals.  Pallys doing single tank healing and I do chain heals on the tanks.</div>

				Let me add another criteria for using a spell haste set: There is little chance of your shadow priest dieing. By wearing this gear, you are dependent upon another player (not my favorite situation). For example, I will not wear spell haste for Teron Gorefiend. My shadow priest could easily be chosen for Shadow of Death. And while I would hope that we have a combat rez or soul stone available, I don’t want to take a chance on something going wrong in such a healing intensive fight.
			
		</td>

</div>Isn't teron gorefiend one of the shorter fights out there though? Hadn't done the fight but wouldn't haste be nice on a short fight since even if your SP dies you're not going to burn through mana in such a short fight anyway? Or is it longer/more intensive than I think?<br>
<br>
<br>
Also wanted to add that while gearing for no shadow priest because your shadow priest might die is a wonderful thing if he dies, but if he doesn't die you end up with a sub-optimal gearset which makes you not as useful as you could be.</div>

</div>You're correct. Teron not only is one of the shorter fights but only becomes healing intensive in the last 45-60 seconds. It is the quintessential fight for haste to be of some use for a shaman (or at least haste procs). The raid is taking constant damage, the fight is relatively short, you are spamming chain heal the entire time... very haste friendly. If you happen to not have a shadow priest or your shadow priest dies then using <a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33505" target="_blank">Totem of Living Water</a> should be enough to carry you (40mp5 while spamming).</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">A couple things to note on that. First, is that for a mouseover macro, in order for self-cast heals to work you would need to add an additional condition to that to the effect of [modifier:alt, target=player] otherwise attempting to self-cast using alt will not work properly. Second is a bit of personal preference, but typically I would move mouseover to be the first choice for healing targets. Makes things a bit simpler when you want to keep a closer eye on a tank (or anyone really, as your target), use mouseover to heal whoever needs it at the time, then mouseover blank space to heal the person you're focusing on.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>That's a very good point; I am simply not good at reliably finding a point of blank space required to make priorizing mouseover work   Actually, there is one thing that bugs me to no end about the default UI and I don't think there is a way to change it: I would like to leave myself with NO target by default, and only acquire a target manually.  Unfortunately, if I get hit by any incidental damage, my target will immediately change from no target to the target that damaged me.  This is wonderful behavior in most situations, but in PvE healing it is a terrible behavior.</div>

</div>I have the Suntouched Leggings aswell and just followed the socket bonus out of old habit when I got them, plus the socket bonus is a nice +9 healing. I agree with you that going pure red gems is probably a bit better even tho socket bonus is so nice. <br>
<br>
But there are some other issues to think about when it comes to the red gems. How rich is my guild on these gems? Should resto shamans get red gems before some of the dps classes? When I get new items I dont wanna ask for red gems if I feel we're short on them cos some classes can basically only socket red gems (SP's come to mind). If this is not an issue for you then by all means gogo pure +22 heal socketing.<br>
<br>
Personally when I get my hands on T6 chest or shoulders I'm gonna ask for red gems cos I am way high on mp5 so I wont benefit from purple gems at all plus chest socket bonus is mp5. I can always put +13 healing gems in the sockets when I wait for us to get more gems.</div>

And now I'm internally debating should I go RRR(3*<a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32195"><span><span class="purplename">[Teardrop Crimson Spinel]</span></span></a> for 66heal (or 70 heal with the personal JC gem)? Or should I go the "old" way with 2*<a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32216"><span><span class="purplename">[Royal Shadowsong Amethyst]</span></span></a> and either <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32219"><span><span class="purplename">[Luminous Pyrestone]</span></span></a> or <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32225"><span><span class="purplename">[Dazzling Seaspray Emerald]</span></span></a>?<br>
<br>
Because I don't value INT at all, my gut feeling is to go for RRR as it's essentially a trade between 4MP5 vs 24heal.<br>
<br>
Any thought from better equipped shamans? Is it too early to go +heal only? Do I need (much) more MP5 for the last half of BT?</div>

Sure, the set bonus of +9 healing is nice but you can get far more +healing by using three red gems – an additional +24 healing at a cost of 4 mp5 and +5 Intellect. That’s a pretty good deal in my opinion.<br>
<br>
If Crimson Spinels are in tight supply, use <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=24029"><span><span class="bluename">[Teardrop Living Ruby]</span></span></a> x3 until more epic gems become available.<br>
<br>
Now, let’s say an item had a blue and red gem socket and bonus of +7 healing. In that case, I would recommend putting in the correct color gems. Because of the socket bonus, using a <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32216"><span><span class="purplename">[Royal Shadowsong Amethyst]</span></span></a> in the blue slot really gives you +18 healing. You lose +4 healing but gain +2 mp5. I would readily sacrifice +4 healing for +2 mp5. However, I would not give up +24 healing for +4 mp5 and some Intellect.<br>
<br>
Epic gems of certain colors are usually in short supply when a guild first enters Hyjal and the Black Temple. Usually, red and orange gems are very popular. You may also be tight on blue gems (depending on how many you give your tanks). Guilds usually have more than enough green, yellow and purple gems.<br>
<br>
Most guilds implement a policy of giving epic gems to item that drops in Hyjal and Black Temple. After guilds have been in BT and Hyjal for a while, they will usually give gems to loot that drops in ZA or items that won’t be upgraded soon.<br>
<br>
The epic gems are usually provided the same night as you get an item or the next time that color gem drops. To decide who should get gems first if they are in short supply, use your guilds DKP system or simply give the gems in the order that the items dropped. Players can always use blue-quality gems while waiting for epic gems.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Should resto shamans get red gems before some of the dps classes? When I get new items I dont wanna ask for red gems if I feel we're short on them cos some classes can basically only socket red gems (SP's come to mind). If this is not an issue for you then by all means gogo pure +22 heal socketing.<br>
<br>
Personally when I get my hands on T6 chest or shoulders I'm gonna ask for red gems cos I am way high on mp5 so I wont benefit from purple gems at all plus chest socket bonus is mp5. I can always put +13 healing gems in the sockets when I wait for us to get more gems.</div>

<br>
I’m all for being considerate of guildmates. However, I think it is a big mistake to socket with <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32216"><span><span class="purplename">[Royal Shadowsong Amethyst]</span></span></a> and <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32219"><span><span class="purplename">[Luminous Pyrestone]</span></span></a> just because Crimson Spinels are in short supply. I would be reluctant to let someone resocket an item that already had epic gems. You would destroy three epic gems in the process that someone else could have used. You would be better off using <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=24029"><span><span class="bluename">[Teardrop Living Ruby]</span></span></a> until Crimson Spinels were more plentiful. I would only want to see someone destroying epic gems due to a change in game mechanices such as the increased mana regeneration in Patch 2.3. <br>
<br>
Shadow priests are no more vital to a raid than resto shaman. Healers are just as important as DPS. If your guild makes epic gems available to you, ask for the color gems that are the best for you. By all means be considerate of your guildmates but not to the point where you are “way high on mp5.” Did it occur to you that your shadow priests can also use Living Rubies while they wait for more Crimson Spinel to drop?</div>

</div>We been farming Illidan for some time now its not really an issue of just starting BT Hyjal.  My guild is structured a little differently than most with a heavy emphasis on DPS.  So dps classes get spinels first combined with our perpetual lousey spinel drop rate it means its not really worth waiting around for the spinel for 3 months.   That is not just shadow preists using spinels that's locks, spriests, mages, hunters, enh sham, ret pally, wars etc.  <br>
<br>
I didn't really feel the 10 healing gained by using <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=24029"><span><span class="bluename">[Teardrop Living Ruby]</span></span></a> was worth the 4mp5 and 5int since the 5int is 1.67 healing as well making it 8.3 healing difference.  Its stats I don't really need but that just means I can have less regen on other parts of my gear.  <br>
<br>
Since 18x3 = 54 healing<br>
<br>
11x3form royals and   +9socket bonus +1.67healing from int = 43.67 helaing + 4mp5 + 5int<br>
<br>
I think thats hardly a clear which option is superior.  For me since its more than likely we will start sunwell before there are enough spinels to go around ( we get like 1-2 a week it seems) I think that without spinels going the alternate epic gem route is fine esp if you are in a similar situation.</div>

</div>I think you meant 11x2 from royals and 11x1 from luminous but the math is correct either way. I had no idea that some guilds were facing a three month wait. I still think the three spinels are the superior option. However, if I had to wait three months, I would make the same gemming choice as you did and go with the epic royals and luminous. <br>
<br>
A little trash farming can greatly help a guild's supply of Hearts of Darkness and epic gems. We've done it a few nights when not enough people were logged on for the raid to start. However, we had enough to easily clear Black Temple trash.</div>

</div>Yeah I should have been a little more clear on that 11x2 from royals and 11x1 for luminous.  There is basically no time for trash farming unless we changed our raiding schedule.  Usually we clear to illidan on tues then do Illidan + Hyjal on wed so farming is basically out of the question.<br>
<br>
I would have preferred 3 spinels as well I have no disagreement there.  However, due to our terrible luck getting them to drop and extremely high demand from basically every DPS class except for the blood frenzy war its not always practical.  I don't know if other guild have better luck with them than we do or have less demand but its somthing to keep in mind.<br>
<br>
Basically our gm said that since we just don't have the spinels to go around and dps has priority on spinels he gave us priority on shadowsongs so it works out in the end.  We have alot of top 10 DPS (of WWS parses) for bosses in BT Hyjal (which makes it easier to heal) so I can't really argue with our results even if its mildly annoying missing out on the extra healing.  If others guilds don't have similar problems, I would recommend others to get the spinels.</div>

You're right - I'll probably have to first check the availability of the spinels. If I can get them, perfect - if I can't, I'll probably go the Shaodwsong/Pyrestone route.<br>

The reasoning for not going with 3 living rubies is pretty much that I don't think I'd really replace them with the epic ones anyway AND with a bit of luck I'll have the T6 leggings at the point we'll have enough spinels.<br>

		<div id="post_message_596219">The longer-lasting water shield in Patch 2.3.2 is great. So is getting a consistent amount of mp5 instead of getting one big chunk every minute. Anyone come across any undocumented changes that affect shaman? I read in another forum that <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=25897"><span><span class="bluename">[Bracing Earthstorm Diamond]</span></span></a> does not need more yellow gems than blue gems. I'm at work so I can't confirm. However, this would make the gem a more viable option for healers. It would still have limited benefit for raids since threat is not an issue in the majority of fights. However, I'll take all the threat reduction I can get when I heal heroics for someone's alt tank and don't have a paladin for Blessing of Salvation.<br>
<br>
I’ve added a few new sections to the main post during the past few days. The section on Tier 2 is now complete. I’ve been pondering a few additional changes. Let me know what you think. And thanks to everyone who has taken so much time and thought to post or correct errors. It greatly enhances the guide.<br>
<br>
<u>Grid/Xperl/Pitbill</u><br>
One of the tips in the guide is "Find a way to easily monitor the health of everyone in the raid and target them for healing. Many healers like using either Xperl or Grid."<br>
<br>
Should Pitbull be added to this list? <br>
<br>
Also, are Xperl and Grid comparable or is Grid the better system? I use Xperl myself. I have tried Grid twice but I just don’t like how it presents information graphically (just a personal preference). Is there anything Grid does that Xperl cannot do? Also, will Grid show incoming heals if healers are using Clique or another mouse-over system?<br>
<br>
<u>Clique</u><br>
I’d like to hear what other shaman think about Clique and similar mouse-over healing systems. All the healers in my guild started using this a few month ago and we will never go back to selecting a target and then pushing a key to heal. Switching to Clique (and other mods) slightly improved our reaction times (and freed up keys that could be bound to do other actions). Should the guide more strongly encourage healers to use this mod of targeting and healing? <br>

You've posted a lot on what heals are the best on mana/heal ratio, what points to put in what spots, and on down ranking and all that stuff, but you haven't posted HOW to heal. This guide shows you what stats you should be looking for, the items you should get, but again, I've yet to learn HOW to heal from the guide. <br>
<br>
Thing is, I just switched from a (nearly) epicced out enhance set to a resto set recently, with about +1000 healing. I would like to know things like how to heal 5 mans/heroics, and how to heal raiding wise. I know it all depends on the group make-up and boss fight, but I would appreciate some advice on what spells to use, and spell rotations. This guide teaches you how to heal like a pro, minus the "how to heal" part.<br>
<br>
Please don't take my ranting badly, this really is a good guide =)</div>

</div>What do the rest of you think? Does the main page need a little more basic healing information before launching into mana/heal ratios and downranking? I went and reread Murderbot’s guide to see if I could incorporate some of his information into this post. I really like his guide but I also feel it’s more directed at a shaman in heroics or Kara. I wrote my guide from the perspective of a shaman in a 25-man raid. However, I did feel that Blazingwater raised a valid point. I really never tell you to heal. I assume that you know how to heal and were reading the post to find out how to be a better healer. Suggestions? Leave the guide as is or is it missing a key component?<br>
<br>
<u>Haste</u><br>
The only major section that is still “under construction” is Haste. Haste is probably one of the most complicated mechanics in the game, especially for casters. I took a stab at modifying Diadalos’ Excel spreadsheet to include an option for lag time when making haste calculations. <br>
<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302211010/http://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=pWRMhB3kyMi-JMRI4gmcKYw&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">http://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?k...I4gmcKYw&amp;hl=en</a><br>
<br>
However, anything to do with formulas and math is not my strong point. So it’s entirely possible I’ve mucked up the calculations but I did a scenario with 1800 +healing and no haste and 1700 + healing and 100 haste rating (6.34%).  I assumed that it would take me 3.0 seconds to get off a chain heal, rather than 2.5 seconds. All the benefits of +healing and haste are based on the 2.5 second cast time. However, the HPS is based on the 3.0 cast time to create a more realistic scenario. So with 6.34% haste (and -100 +healing) my HPS rose 3.35% for Rank 5 chain heal and 2.95% for Rank 4.<br>
<br>
I would love to see some WWS data. Perhaps if there’s a boss that you do not one-shot you could wear your haste gear on some attempts and your regular gear on other attempts. That might give us a look at the benefit of haste under raid conditions.<br>
<br>
If anyone has better suggestions on how to better gauge the benefit of haste, please let me know.</div>

I forgot about that trinket and will add to the list.<br>
<br>
I didn't factor in the 4pT6 bonus. I forgot that on the "Overview" tab that Diadalos had included set bonuses. I only modified the equations on the Healing Wave and Chain Heal tabs (and added a spot to add a value for actual cast time on Stat1 and Stat2). To be on the safe side, I wouldn't use the values on the Overview tab since my modifications may have screwed up the equations Diadalos used.<br>

Personally I use pitbull and love it.  I actually have grid tucked away in a corner of my screen since it a little easier to tell the exact health decefit than it is with pitbull.  However the reason I primarily use pitbull is having raid icons on the bars.  For example on Illidan when a raid member gets the parasites a there is a big X on the bar to click on no reading of names needed.  I think xperl basically has simlar features but I have not used it.  So far pitbull just has a few more features I really like over grid. I would def add it to UI suggestions.<br>
<br>
I've done some math on healing haste before and basically lag time between casts while does affect haste it affect everything else as well so long term it still has almost identical % gains after lag (~90%+ with .2s lag) in factored in (assuming you factor it into the non hasted calculations as well)<br>
<br>
If I remember I'll try to not wear haste in next BT for comparison. This past weeks I wore haste on most fights.  There is another shaman with similar gear who doesn't wear haste but healing style, assignments, and whatnot were different so not a comepletely valid comparison.</div>

</div>I share your point of view on Grid. I have tried it a couple times and just could not get used to seeing the little boxes. Everyone's names are cut off, and the Shaman health bar and mana bar are the same color so it confuses me. I use Pitbull for my raid frames exclusively and I have no problem with it at all. I feel that it should definitely be added to the list. For those of you who do not like Pitbull for any reason, I'd like to hear what your other mods do that Pitbull doesn't, or just why you don't like it.<br>

</div>Since the title of the post is entitled "How to Heal like a Pro", I think it should have some discussion about healing strategy and not just gear and math. Murderbot's guide certainly did help me out a lot when I was still doing Heroics and Karazhan, so let's continue it. Perhaps some discussion about healing assignments and what a Resto Shaman should be doing in specific boss encounters would be the way to go.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
On a separate note, I tried your suggestion of healing the Paladin tank for Illidari Council yesterday. I took one of the Paladins off of that duty and told him to raid heal instead while I spammed Chain Heal rank 5 on the tank. It worked just as good as you all said it would, and that's the way we're going to kill the Council from now on. Here is the log from the attempt:<br>
<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302211010/http://spruce.phpwebhosting.com/~gian/STASIS/wws-20080107-2056/index.html" target="_blank">WWS</a><br>
<br>
I want to point out a few things here.<br>
<br>
1) The <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28823"><span><span class="purplename">[Eye of Gruul]</span></span></a> procced 16 times during this 10 minute fight, which comes out to (16*450)/(10*12) = 60 Mp5. This makes it a very good trinket for this encounter. <br>
<br>
2) The <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=25901"><span><span class="bluename">[Insightful Earthstorm Diamond]</span></span></a> procced 16 times for the Resto Druid in my raid during this 10 minute fight. This gave him what amounts to 40 Mp5 for this encounter, and he cast a hot every global cooldown. In contrast my <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=25893"><span><span class="bluename">[Mystical Skyfire Diamond]</span></span></a> was pretty much useless as the half-cast proc really didn't do much at all for the tank.<br>
<br>
Now, before any of you starts getting in an "I TOLD YOU SO!!" attitude, I want to re-iterate what I said on the first page of this thread - and that's that not all gear is good in all situations, and this is especially true for trinkets. While the <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28823"><span><span class="purplename">[Eye of Gruul]</span></span></a> is awesome for the Illidari Council fight (when assigned to heal the tank), it's certainly not a very good trinket for the Illidan fight (one week it procced only 8 times for me over the 19 minute fight). Likewise, I knew the <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28190"><span><span class="bluename">[Scarab of the Infinite Cycle]</span></span></a> would not be very useful for the Illidari Council fight, so I took it off and put on my <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=13503"><span><span class="purplename">[Alchemist's Stone]</span></span></a> instead. On the other hand, the scarab is amazing during Naj'entus, Bloodboil, and Reliquary of Souls. In order to do the same with Meta Gems, though, you'd have to have two helms =\.<br>
<br>
In any case, instead of listing the trinkets on the main post by "tier"s, perhaps there should be a little discussion on each trinket describing the situations in which they shine and the situations in which they suck. What do you think?</div>

I’d like to hear what other shaman think about Clique and similar mouse-over healing systems. All the healers in my guild started using this a few month ago and we will never go back to selecting a target and then pushing a key to heal. Switching to Clique (and other mods) slightly improved our reaction times (and freed up keys that could be bound to do other actions). Should the guide more strongly encourage healers to use this mod of targeting and healing? <br></div>

</div><br>
I'm a huge fan of mouse-over healing. I think it is far better then manual targeting then a casting heal method, mainly since it's faster. I use mainly /mouseover macros for healing, with poison/disease cleansing and my NS macro setup in Clique.<br>
<br>
I've used Grid for a long time, I like the way it's laid out. You can easily change the shape and orientation of the targeting frames if you want. I haven't tried any other raid frames since CTRaid, so I'm not that familiar with them. You can change the way Grid looks and reports information, like adding debuffs to show up for certain boss encounters.<br>
<br>
Good luck trying to quantify +haste gear, I've always had a hard time deciding when it's best to use and when not.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic"><u>Grid/Xperl/Pitbill</u><br>
One of the tips in the guide is "Find a way to easily monitor the health of everyone in the raid and target them for healing. Many healers like using either Xperl or Grid."<br>
<br>
Should Pitbull be added to this list? <br>
<br>
Also, are Xperl and Grid comparable or is Grid the better system? I use Xperl myself. I have tried Grid twice but I just don’t like how it presents information graphically (just a personal preference). Is there anything Grid does that Xperl cannot do? Also, will Grid show incoming heals if healers are using Clique or another mouse-over system?<br>
<br>

</div>I am not completely sure what mouse over healing means. Is it what healbot does ? Like you hover your mouse over your healing target and click then mouse click your healing spell ?. I think it would be a good idear to explain the different words and options the addons gives. It is hard for an outsider to understand the options in different addons and pick the right one for themselves.<br>
<br>
I personally use healbot after testing grid, which I absolutely hated. You just have to turn of smartheal on healbot if you use it, as it is anoing, that it picks which heal to heal for you. I belive I  know better wich heal to use in which situation, than healbot. It has allot of options in how to show the healthbars. Colouring choice depending on if person is cursed or poisoned e.g. incoming heal or people out of range.<br>
But it be interesting to know if there are any other mods out there which makes me a better healer. I am close to be to dependent on healbot to heal, so if I am suddenly without healbot I don't know what to do, as using my mouse as mainhealing is not an option.<br>
I have a G9 mouse so I can just setup some keybindings to heal with the mouse, but the options will be limited compared to healbot, as blizzard keybingdings demands you got bar your using set to current actionbar. Healbot only supports 5 mouse buttons</div>

		<div id="post_message_596903">It could be of interest to share with each other healing tips for specific fights. I'll start with black temple boss fights (killed Illidan for the first time in August).<br>
<br>
CH: Chain Heal<br>
HW: Healing Wave<br>
LWH: Lesser Healing Wave<br>
SP: Shadow Priest<br>
<br>
Chain heal usage: It is very important to check how many targets the CH has attained, you can use sct to show your heals (and overheal).<br>
<br>
<u>Najentus</u>: It is possible to chain heal the melees usually, even though they try to spread as much as possible. Heal spread out players with HW but if the shield is about to occur, use LHW to heal them to full. Healing totem is very good in this fight (not in a SP group of course).<br>
<br>
<u>Supremus</u>: Low rank chain heal on tanks and the hateful strike soakers.<br>
<br>
<u>Akama</u>: Usually chain heal does not work so well. Heal with HW when possible or LHW if necessary.<br>
<br>
<u>Teron</u>: Just chain heal. Alternate with lower ranks if you're not in a SP group.<br>
<br>
<u>Gurtog</u>: CH works very well. During fel rage use HW.<br>
<br>
<u>RoS</u>: CH works very well. In phase 2 cast your earth shield on a shadow priest for instance, the charge will not go off but it is useful for the anti-pushback. At the end of phase 2, do not forget to cast healing totem and earth shield on yourself, while you still have the aura the desire (double the heals). You will have them for the beginning of phase 3 and they are amazing with the aura of desire boost.<br>
<br>
<u>Mother Sharaz</u>: CH works very well.<br>
<br>
<u>Council</u>: It really depends on your role in the fight. Just a tip: when healing the melees you can see the paladin consecration animation a few seconds before damage actually starts to tick, therefore you can start the CH cast before damage occurs and have it land just at the right time.<br>
<br>
<u>Illidan</u>: In phase 1 use HW. Phase 2 (elementals) go crazy with CH. Afterwards it is HW except right after the AoE damage in demon form when you use LHW. Water shield is amazing in this fight since there are a lot of effects that consumes the charges. Use earth shield during phase 2 for the anti-pushback but use water shield otherwise (you have to refresh it every 30s if not more frequently).<br>
<br>
Let me know if you find this information useful or not at all.</div>

		<div id="post_message_597298">As far as giving Earth Shield to casters:<br>
Healers generally have 70% pushback resistance.<br>
So do (common Fire) Mages and (Destruction) Warlocks.<br>
Hybrids get none (Moonkin, Elemental Shaman and Shadow Priest) so any of those should be first choice when attempting to improve raid DPS with Earth Shield.  Elemental Shaman probably benefit the most due to almost entirely cast time spells, but Priests and Moonkins are close behind, and Mind Flay is especially bad when pushed back (rather, channel time is just lost).  Most hunter damage isn't terribly effected by pushback, I don't think, but moreover I don't have any clue whether Earth Shield would help with things like Slam or Steady Shot.  Now that I think about it, it probably doesn't.</div>

</div>Can't say I agree with this strategy. I use Healing Wave almost exclusively on this fight, save Lesser Healing Wave on the people who can't seem to avoid fire and volcanos. I've found that there's not enough damage going around to justify the use of Chain Heal. <br>
<br>
Pretty spot on with the rest of the fights you've listed though. It's what I do on most of them, at least.<br>
<br>
Forgive me if this was mentioned, but has anybody else noticed a Water Shield bug with Archimonde or Supremus? A Shaman in our guild mentioned that there seems to be some sort of pulse that eats charges, even if you're not taking any damage. Also,  a Water Shield proc pulled aggro on Archimonde as we ran in for an attempt. Perhaps this is some sort of pulse to make sure everybody is in combat?</div>

</div>Ya its been that way since the instance was released as far as I know.  Matter of fact shaman tend to get initial aggro on arch due to the initial pulse trigging water shield.  Makes it scary before the hunter MD hits.  I started standing close to the MT until the MD hits just in case after that happened a few times.</div>

</div>Steady Shot (and Aimed Shot, which is irrelevant when discussing DPS) is effected by pushback, and causes Auto Shot clipping when it does. I've never done any testing with Earth Shield and Steady Shot though so I can't comment on that.</div>

</div>Some of the information is very useful. But much of it is too general. It’s a given that some rank of Chain Heal works well in most fights. Plus, different players have different styles and techniques for healing. Let’s stick to healing tips that really add some value. For example, I like what you posted about RoS: <br>

				<div style="font-style:italic"> <u>RoS</u>: CH works very well. In phase 2 cast your earth shield on a shadow priest for instance, the charge will not go off but it is useful for the anti-pushback. At the end of phase 2, do not forget to cast healing totem and earth shield on yourself, while you still have the aura the desire (double the heals). You will have them for the beginning of phase 3 and they are amazing with the aura of desire boost.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Water shield is amazing in this fight since there are a lot of effects that consumes the charges. Use earth shield during phase 2 for the anti-pushback but use water shield otherwise (you have to refresh it every 30s if not more frequently).</div>

</div>I think these boss-specific healing tips are very helpful and will create a section on the main post where we can compile the best ones. Let’s also add for which fights you think wearing haste gear helps. For example, someone recommended wearing haste for Teron Gorefiend – even without a shadow priest in your group due to the fast heals you need to get off the last 45 seconds of the fight and the short duration of the fight.<br>
<br>
<br>
I’m also going to add some information on what can be purged, interrupted with Earth Shock or absorbed by grounding for different encounters. If you think that information is too broad and should be a separate post let me know. I realize it would have value for enhancement and elemental shaman as well.<br>

<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302213158/http://spruce.phpwebhosting.com/~gian/STASIS/wws-20080107-2056/index.html" target="_blank">WWS</a><br>
<br>
I want to point out a few things here.<br>
<br>
The <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28823"><span><span class="purplename">[Eye of Gruul]</span></span></a> procced 16 times during this 10 minute fight, which comes out to (16*450)/(10*12) = 60 Mp5. This makes it a very good trinket for this encounter.<br>
<br>
In any case, instead of listing the trinkets on the main post by "tier"s, perhaps there should be a little discussion on each trinket describing the situations in which they shine and the situations in which they suck. What do you think?</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>I think it’s an excellent suggestion. I’ll get to work on it. What I might do is create some different categories to replace the Tiers. For example, “All-Around Best Trinkets” and “Situationally Useful” and “Oldies but Goodies” and “Easy to Get” (all those quest rewards). The “All-Around Best Trinkets” would mainly be the ones listed as Tier I now. Let me know if you have any creative suggestions for the names of various trinket categories (Vendor It?) I’ll also try to add more information for each trinket.<br>
<br>
<br>
I’m going to have to wear my Eye of Gruul again for some fights. I never got it to proc that much. There's some theorycrafting in this post on Eye of Gruul: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302213158/http://elitistjerks.com/f31/t12459-shaman_resto_spec/p10/" target="_blank">[Shaman] Resto-Spec</a> <br>
<br>
Here's the short version: <br>
<br>
Worst Case: Healing Wave 2.5 second cast. Cast lag 0.5 seconds. 50% mana saved. 225 Mana Regenerated / ( 100 % chance / 2 % chance * 3 seconds total cast time ) ) = 1.5 mana per second = 7.5 mp5 <br>
<br>
Mid Case: Chain Heal 2.5 second cast. Cast lag 0.25 seconds. Targets hit per cast 2. 75% mana saved. 337.5 / ( 100 / 3.96 * 2.75 ) = 4.86 = 24.3 mp5 <br>
<br>
Best Case: Chain Heal 2.5 second cast. Cast lag 0 seconds. Targets hit per cast 3. 100% mana saved. 450 / ( 100 / 5.88 * 2.5) = 10.59 = 52.93 mp5<br>
<br>
<br>
I usually got 20-25 mp5 when I wore it. However, that was pre-Patch 2.3 and perhaps on less than ideal fights. I wonder if Eye of Gruul is the sort of item where it can easily return 50+ mp5 on one boss and below 20 mp5 on another even though you spam chain heal on both fights? Perhaps due to the length of the encounter? I’ll try to wear it for BT tonight and post the WWS.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">As far as giving Earth Shield to casters:<br>
Healers generally have 70% pushback resistance.<br>
So do (common Fire) Mages and (Destruction) Warlocks.<br>
Hybrids get none (Moonkin, Elemental Shaman and Shadow Priest) so any of those should be first choice when attempting to improve raid DPS with Earth Shield.  Elemental Shaman probably benefit the most due to almost entirely cast time spells, but Priests and Moonkins are close behind, and Mind Flay is especially bad when pushed back (rather, channel time is just lost).  Most hunter damage isn't terribly effected by pushback, I don't think, but moreover I don't have any clue whether Earth Shield would help with things like Slam or Steady Shot.  Now that I think about it, it probably doesn't.</div>

</div>This is incredibly useful information to keep in mind. I’ll add it to the main post. I would add that paladins would get little benefit from Earth Shield due to the fact that their talents with an aura give them 100% pushback resistance. Plus, they wear plate.<br>

<br>
Could u include the math behind the living water totem and 2pc t6? does the 20 mana reduction kick in before, or after the 10% from t6? If it was to kick in before the 10%, then you would save less mana from 2pc t6. Conversely, if the 10% was to kick in first, then the 20 mana reduction would be more efficient. <br>

</div>How does spiritual attunement interact with earthshield? If they count as healing themselves it would also be better to let someone else heal them so they gain mana.<br>
<br>
One thing to keep in mind though is that in some cases having a healer with 100% pushback resistance is more valuable than having a dps with pushback resistance. Eg, Hex Lord's spirit bolts on Zul'Jin. If you don't have a tree druid or a CoH priest you will want to get an uninterruptable chain heal (or prayer of healing). While the fight does have a DPS race component, the heal interruption is really more important at that particular point than the dps interruption.<br>
I don't know of any other cases that highlight it quite that spectacularly, but I suspect that interruption on healing in general is more important than interruption on dps, except in specific circumstances.</div>

</div>It counts as them healing themselves, same as the final "bloom" on Lifebloom. Hence, it's something I prefer not to use on our pally tank, instead saving it for the warrior or druid.

</div>Earthshield is great for threat since the tank gets credit for the heal. I keep it up on the Prot tank during Hyjal for all the trash, he will usually eat up all 10 charges within 40 seconds or less, it's also insanely mana efficient. I make sure the tank always has ES before aggro-wipe transitions, like from P2 to P3 Illidan, he always gets ES.<br>
<br>
Skyhoof - I'll list all the fights I know of where watershield is 'bugged' and charges get consumed for no apparent reason. Supremus - think it's tied to him making the fire lines. Mother - charges seem to get used up very fast, there is a decent amount of raid-wide damage, but I think some of her debuffs which don't do damage will proc it. Illidan - Parasite debuff on anyone in the raid seems to be a trigger. Archimonde - no clue what procs it here, but it goes off like crazy.<br>
<br>
<br>
I'm not sure why people are so stuck on using Healing Wave for topping off the raid. With 2000 +heal and either Chain Heal trinket your Chain Heal should be more healing per mana then Healing Wave on a single target. Now if you are going to cast multiple heals on a target, usually a tank, definitely use HW for the Healing Way buff. But if you are doing raid top-offs for most fights like myself, I barely ever use HW, CH is more mana efficent on that single target and sometimes you'll get lucky and it jumps, making it even better then HW. Average Recount for a night has me around 80% CH, 15% LHW, and 5% HW. I keep expecting Blizz to nerf CH, most likely by increasing it's mana cost. Something is a bit unbalanced when my 'AoE' heal is more mana efficient then my direct heal on a single target...</div>

Totem of Living Water is much better then Maelstrom for mana efficiency.

</div>Ah good point about living water.  I forgot about that.  I think you meant living water is better than healing rains though?  <br>
<br>
I haven't picked up living water since it applies before my 2 pc pc t6 bonus I would rather have more healing from my chain heals than more efficiency.  With the latest water shield changes I'm finding times where I don't even mana tide where I did before (mostly due to chain casting and not wanting to waste GCDs on water shield).<br>
<br>
Can you post some numbers? I'm curious where are numbers don't match.</div>

</div>For a resto chaman with +2000 heal and totem of healing rains:<br>
The efficiency of HW rank 12 with no healing way stack is 6.43 HPM (Heal Per Mana).<br>
The efficiency of CH rank 5 on 1 target is 5.47 HPM.<br>
So HW is more efficent than CH. <br>
<br>
However with the 4-piece T6 bonus the efficiency of CH on 1 target becomes 6.38 HPM so it is almost equal to HW. <br>
<br>
With higher healpower (and still with 4T6) <b>the efficiency of CH on 1 target becomes higher than the one of HW</b>, so the quoted statement is true but only with the 4-piece T6 bonus.<br>
<br>
I personnally find this quite striking as I was not aware of this fact. So I'll probably only use CH on najentus in the future  (along whis LHW when necessary of course)<br>
<br>
<br>
<i>PS</i><br>
edit: here are my numbers<br>
For a resto chaman with +2000 heal and totem of healing rains:<br>
HW rank 12 with no healing way heals for 4400 and costs 684 mana. 4400/684 = 6.43 HPM<br>
With no T6 bonus, CH rank 5 on 1 target heals for 2807 and costs 513 mana. 2807/513 = 5.47 HPM<br>
With 4-piece T6 bonus, CH rank 5 on 1 target heals for 2947 and costs 462 mana. 2947/462 = 6.38 HPM<br>
<br>
With the 4-piece T6 bonus, +2400 heal and totem of healing rains:<br>
HW rank 12 with no healing way heals for 4776 and costs 684 mana. 4776/684 = 6.98 HPM<br>
CH rank 5 on 1 target heals for 3277 and costs 462 mana. 3277/462 = 7.09 HPM<br>
CH is more effient than HW in Heal Per Mana.<br>
<br>
<i>Post-Post-Scriptum</i><br>
HW has a much better HPS (Heal Per Second), so if you're sure the CH will not jump to a second target and you don't necessarily want to save mana, HW is better than CH, even with no healing way stack.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">As a shaman most of the time im assigned to raidhealing which basicly means chain heal/lesser healing wave rotation, i usualy end the night with less than 10 healing waves casted, almost all of them after nature swiftness, thats why i simply dont see the point to take improved healing wave and healing way. On MT healing paladins and priests simply outheal us (we do have one shaman on MT tho for ancestral fortitude buff). I can tsay im happy about Blizzard making us almost one button class, but thats the reality - chainheal is the best raidhealing skill in wow atm (there are not much, but still there are some fights where its not that efficient). We have the improved chainheal as talent and t6 bonuses are simply awesome, thats why as soon i droped t5 4piece bonus i droped the healing wave talents. I admit healing way looks nice on first sight - more healing is always nice, but if you think about it to be viable you have to be on MT healing and the maintank is always spamed from the paladins, hoted, earthshielded, power word shielded so this 18% more healing from healing wave ONLY are rather useless. As for the elemental warding - its an awesome talent which is not viable but compared to what you drop to spec it gives it huge advantage. Improved reincarnation is the most underrated resto talent imo, i admit you should not die, but still there some fights where this is unavoidable (Teron, Azgalor) or if you are very unlucky to take all the AOEs on the council or you aint healed on time on barrage on Illidan and ankh up w/o this talent is near to useless (you ankh with 2k mana = 4-5 heals, at least one of them on you). Anyway thats my opinion for the spec.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>I'm not sure I agree with this.  Likely it will depend heavily upon the group you raid with, and your healing team.  On specific fights I'm actually spamming LHW even though I certainly would rather not (Najentus), others I'm all about Chain Heal.  Last night on Azgalor I found myself using HW r8 a suprising amount, to the tune of 25% or more, without excessive overheal.  Given that, Healing Way more than paid for itself in my spec.</div>

</div>I thought pushback resistance was one of the few mechanics in the game that was additive. For example the 70% from Earth Shield was added to the 35% from Aura of Concentration to equal 100% resistance (105% technically).<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Just a suggestion regarding the Relics section:<br>
<br>
Could u include the math behind the living water totem and 2pc t6? does the 20 mana reduction kick in before, or after the 10% from t6? If it was to kick in before the 10%, then you would save less mana from 2pc t6. Conversely, if the 10% was to kick in first, then the 20 mana reduction would be more efficient. <br>
<br>
Cheers.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>Relics are applied before set bonuses. So, yes, you save slightly less mana from the set bonus when using the totem – 2 mana per heal (51.3 mana saved vs. 49.3 mana saved). It’s not really significant.<br>
<br>
Mana is really not an issue for our class anymore with the change to water shield and the mana spring totem. Most shaman will want to use <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28523"><span><span class="purplename">[Totem of Healing Rains]</span></span></a>. <br>
<br>
Chain Heal (5) with relic and 2T6: (513-20) * .90 = 443.7 mana <br>

</div>I thought pushback was additive as well.  It may be capped at 99% or somthing..unfortunately I don't know of a good way of keeping track of this.  I remember a guildy saying he got pushback once with the 70% interuption prevention and Earth Shield on but I can't say that I've ever noticed any.  At the time I just assumed it was additive and I speculated  that it was an indication it was capped at 99%.<br>
<br>
Perhaps some one can warstomp a frog and let it attack you while you chain cast.  Using quartz there will be a red indicator on the cast time if additional time was added due to pushback.</div>

</div>It procs from Prayer of Mending as well, and I believe from the "bloom" a Lifebloom does when it runs out too.<br>
<br>
It doesn't proc from any other forms of healing that counts as having done it yourself, I'd guess these spells have had a special exception made for them. Not that there are many other spells that work like this, the only real exception that comes to mind being Judgement of Light, the healing of which does not proc Spiritual Attunement regardless of whether it's your own Judgement of Light or the Judgement of Light from another Paladin.</div>

</div>Yes you should select the most efficient spells in order to heal your target to full.  I'm not really sure what you are disagreeing with.  I dont' think anyone is suggesting always useing a certain rank for every health defecit.</div>

		<div id="post_message_599163">This is easy to test, every paladin should know they're additive as holy spec + concentration aura means I never got pushback (unless I forgot to put the aura up).<br>
<br>
I think what PGGarak means is that while a higher efficiency spell is nice and all, but if it's going to overheal you loose all that nifty efficiency. Then again, downranking is generally more efficient anyway, so you don't really change to a difference spell becuase your heal is inefficient, unless chain heal is not an option but HPS is needed in which case LHW will be more efficient than high rank HW if low rank HW is just too low HPS (as in, other people also need heals). Basically the bottom line here is that there will be some odd situations where LHW *will* be the best spell to use.</div>

I did number crunching of every piece and it appears to me that the best pieces to replace would be the boots, gloves, and chest.  This raises a couple of questions:<br>
1) Why does the guide have the 10 Storms bracers, boots, and gloves listed?  It seemed to me like the bracers and belt gave the least hit to stats (maybe I screwed up my math somewhere)<br>
2) Does anyone see a better piece to replace than the chest?  Again, maybe I mis-calculated, but it seemed to be the 'best' piece to lose.<br>

</div>Boots, gloves, bracers or belt are probably all viable options for T2. It will depend largely on what gaer you currently have. However, you don’t want to use both T2 chest and gloves. If you do, you won’t be able to get the four piece T6 bonus. <br>
<br>
P.S. You may want to consider resocketing some of that gear. For example, the belt would really benefit from some living rubies or spinels if you can get them. You could also put two red gems in your shoulders.</div>

</div>There's, of course, other inconviences with trying to get T2 chests.  If I recall correctly, boots, gloves, bracers, belts drop off the bosses in the first half of BWL, so it may or may not save you time.  Besides, you never know when pugs of old instances will suddenly fall apart.....they tend to consist of people hoping for a romp through things with little attention to strategy which falls apart eventually.  <br>
<br>
Additionally, the first T6 most people typically will get will be gloves and then helm.  (Killing Azgalor and Archimonde tends to happen before a Mother Sharaz kill)  Because of such, boots/bracers/belt are the best choice if you really want to go that path.  To hold off on gloves and helm would be a horrible mistake.  You're going to need all the help you need with the 2pc bonus on Bloodboil/RoS/Mother Sharaz.<br>
<br>
Gem sockets are definitely dependent on how your guild groups you though.  Some shamans in my guild love having MP5.  Generally, my belief is that you should find the MINIMUM mp5 you can live with and still finish each fight with like 20-30% mana to spare.  (For those instances when things don't quite go as planned :P)</div>

Also, I was referring to which piece I should switch out now (since tanks get priority in our guild on tier gear and we're just starting on Bloodboil) since I probably won't be seeing that T6 bonus for a while.  Thanks for the advice so far though.  </div>

<br>
TL;DR- Crit beats haste on Chain Heal?<br>
<br>
<br>
HPM- Crit totally wins, it's free and the spells cast through haste aren't.<br>
HPS- It's situational, but I feel like crit might win here too. Crit definitely is the overheal champ, but comparing to haste is most fair when you're casting nonstop. If your CH isn't topping off your targets, critical heals are not wasteful, and luck streaks won't matter, you're just going to keep spamming CH either way. Crit heals on the first target are likely to be overheal, hops are more likely to be effective.<br>
Gear- Question mark. Haste items are limited, and some are dps caster gear or healing with +spirit. Crit only exists on PVP gear and gems/enchants, it gets brownie points for not relying on drops. Percent-for-percent, <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32577"><span><span class="purplename">[Living Earth Bindings]</span></span></a> is 1.8% haste, <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33906"><span><span class="purplename">[Vindicator's Ringmail Bracers]</span></span></a> is 1.2% crit when gemmed with <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30593"><span><span class="purplename">[Iridescent Fire Opal]</span></span></a> to match +healing.<br>
<br>
The tricky part. Haste is essentially a constant +% of healing. Crit is complicated. Being pessimistic and saying that the main target always results in overheal for you or another raidhealer, you've got &lt;crit%&gt; chance of doing 50% more (er... right?) healing twice per cast. The very rough itemization gap above means you get more +% healing with haste rating, but crit has a chance to save mana when you -aren't- casting nonstop, and can close the gap any time your first target is hurt badly enough to need either the crit or Ancestral Fort proc.<br>
<br>
Is there a big glaring detail I'm missing? Is the itemization cost off? Is it common practice to have CH top off targets in Hyjal/BT? Are moments of frantic CH spamming (~Kazzak) too rare to count? Is the reactive healing benefit of haste too good to pass up? Is it a better question to compare crit gemmed BT/S3 gear (sometimes +50% healing) vs. 2-piece Tier 2 (always +30%, minus stat differences)?</div>

</div>Actually I like a little bit of crit.  We already have 5 from resto talents though and crit is somewhat expensive in terms of itemization. Stacking a a little bit of crit is fine but due to its unpredictable nature and how well our spells scale with +healing you shoudn't stack like a paladin or anything.</div>

		<div id="post_message_599939">Crit is not reliable HPS. It's as much of an HPS increase as the scarab is. It is not reliable and will likely to not proc when actually needed as most fights don't need max HPS *all* the time. Haste will always be there to increase your HPS when you need it.<br>
<br>
For efficiency, obviously HPS does nothing (except allowing more downranking while keeping enough efficiency, although that's probably a rather small benefit compared to the efficienty you'd get from other stats). Crit however is pretty bad too because you heal assuming you're not going to crit and thus it'll very often overheal and not do anything even when it does work. Not to mention even if it didn't overheal crit would still be an expensive stat as a way of increasing efficiency. Only use for crit is if your job is to keep +25% armor on the tank.</div>

</div>when it comes to that - healing stream totem is really superb here. Might also be an idea not only for resto shaman but for ele and enh as well.<br>

</div>This is an oft-argued point, but it basically comes down to being a matter of preference.  Increasingly, encounters require varying degrees of mobility, and Boar's Speed helps in that respect.  On the other hand, you have the MP/5 zealots claiming that Vitality is too much MP/5 to ignore.  If you don't have mana issues, then obviously go with Boar's Speed.  Pick your poison!</div>

</div>Honestly you just need to get in the habit of refreshing it whenever you have a 1-2 seconds waiting for someone to take damage or when you have to move for something. It's almost like a nervous tick for me these days, hitting my Water Shield hotkey. There's no benefit to letting it fall off so, just refresh it whenever you've got a brief break from casting regardless of stacks or time left. <br>

Btw, Water Shield hotkey for me is 4 </div>

</div>Once you have the 2 pc T6 bonus haste is great for Chain heals even without a shadow priest. Haste is better for chain heals than crit, but crit affects all spells where haste only benefits ones that are longer than 1.5s.  I personally stack haste since I am mostly a chain heal bot, but to be fair the armor on tanks from the crit in addition to helping out LHW or that CL you chuck when the boss is at 1% is nice.  The raid top off on archimonde or najentus during bubble are good examples where LHW crit can be nice.<br>
<br>
Overall I would go with haste over crit simply because 90% of the time I am spamming chain heals where haste is extremely good.  In terms of HPS haste is 2x the amount of healing crit is (since crits are only 50% additonal healing). <br>
<br>
I could see picking up the shield off supremus or getting a little crit on some other item for that other 10% though.  If you have access to items and they would otherwise go to waste it somthing to consider but not somthing I would go out of my way to gear for.</div>

		<div id="post_message_601756">Haste is more than 2x becuase you need 22.1 crit rating for 1% (0.5% HPS, less since you don't start at 0 crit) while you only need 15.7 haste rating for 1% haste (and it'll be closer to actual 1% if you don't really have haste gear to start with). Not to mention<b> haste is reliable HPS where crit is not, when you're needing HPS to save someone from dying you don't assume the heal will crit you will cast it if the non-crit fills him up, thus a lot of the low HPS you do from crit is lost.</b></div>

</div>Pure genius. Thank you for sharing. Shamanfriend also has an audible warning for when your water shield fades and you can chose from six different sounds. I like your modification since you can choose any sound file you want. <br>
<br>
Can anyone verify if this is true? It seems like as soon a you cast water shield you get 50 mana (rather than receiving the mana at the end of the first five seconds). Then if you cast it again 1.5 seconds later you get another 50 mana. I can't seem to get Eavesdrop to show the mana returned from Water Shield so I'm having difficulty testing the theory. However, if true, you could spam this during combat and double your mana regen.</div>

</div>You can grab the shamanfriend mod, and make it play a sound when water shield expires, as a reminder, which should help. (Beaten twice, oh well)<br>
<br>
Also in raiding you really shouldn't ever not be casting, unless you are moving to avoid damage or moving to heal someone out of line of sight or range. While waiting for someone to take damage you should still be casting, then moving to cancel it if they don't take the damage. That or if the damage is very very light and you know there won't be any damage incoming, you could be spamming rank 1 healing wave to refresh healing way and ancestral healing procs. Also if you can use <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30023"><span><span class="purplename">[Totem of the Maelstrom]</span></span></a> you could also regen mana while you do this too.<br>
<br>
I try to refresh water shield immediately after I finish casting something, that way the loss of a GCD isn't as noticeable.</div>

</div>Well you can use the SCT line if you want. There is the option for 'charges'. I really don't remember it from the top of my head but it's described in the file. Basically you can make 3 events for: 2 charges, 1 charge and faded. I haven't tested it that way but I don't see why it shouldn't work.<br>
<br>
<br>
Oh and one more time about water shield. Someone here stated that you get 50 mana instantly when you cast water shield. I tried it last night and it looks like he was right. Sadly I was in a raid and mana was incoming from multiple sources so  I can't be sure.</div>

</div>Here's some math from the Enhancement Shaman thread. The calculations deal with DPS but I think the results hold true for HPS as well.<br>
<br>
<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px; ">
	<div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom:0px"><img src="assets/citation.gif" border="0"></div>

		<td class="alt2" style="border:1px inset">
			
				Let D be your dps without a boot enchant. For the run speed to provide more benefit, we need:<br>
(D+12A)(T-t) &lt; (D+6A)(T-t/1.08)<br>
which simplifies to<br>
T &lt; [(1-k)D + (2-k)6A]t/(6A)<br>
where k = 1/1.08. For example, gives A = .16286, and so we have<br>
T &lt; (.07581D + 1.074) t<br>
Using some actual data, a shaman that does betwen 900 and 1000 dps will have T &lt; 76.88t<br>
For 5 minutes, we would need t &gt; 3.90 seconds and for 6 minutes we would need t &gt; 4.68 seconds.  <br>
<br>
So for a 5 minute fight if you spend roughly 4 seconds moving between adds, running to the boss, etc, Run Speed provides a superior DPS benefit.

Vitality is a fairly cheap enchant and the extra mana is nice when you first start raiding. However, more stam and faster run speed are much more valuable as you progress into SSC and TK. Plus, you won't be the last person to run back after a wipe anymore <!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I have vitality on my stillwater boots, but I think whatever I get in sunwell will be boars.  The run speed would be nice on those fights where there are fires and you try not to be in them ;-)  or get knocked away like on Archimonde. I would most likely value 9 stam over 4mp5.  4mp5 is just so negligible now with all our other sources of mana.  <br>
<br>
Not a huge deal either way I just have dropped my personal value of mp5 very low since I never run into a mana problem a mana pot doesn't fix.   To be fair everything is on farm and our guild has very high dps so come sunwell my mana situation will worsen I'm sure but even then I don't see 4mp5 ever being noticeable.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_605938"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->boar's speed to HPS conversion for dummies:<br>
Check how much time of a fight you spend moving when you want to be healing, compared to how much time you spend healing. Call that X.<br>
HPS increase will be approximately X*0.08, so if you spend 5% of the healing time moving you will increase your HPS by 0.4%. Scales a lot better on more movement intensive fights, but becomes less accurate as the approximation assumes X&lt;&lt;1, as boar's speed is not really 8% increase to healing time but rather 7.4% reduction to time spent moving. However with time spent moving &lt;=10% the approximation of x*0.08 is pretty damn good enough considering the margin of error in x is already much more significant than the accuracy loss of the approximation.<br>
<br>
And of course, 8% move speed is 8% faster movement out of AOEs. If once an AOE is placed on you you spend, for example, 1/2 the time "reacting" (you realizing you actually need to move) and the other 1/2 actually moving, 8% speed increase will reduce your damage taken by AOEs by approx 4% on average as well, assuming you actually sometimes come close to taking 2 ticks instead of one and/or sometimes come close to never taking a tick, as if you always take 1 tick no matter what it won't make a difference obviously. This logic can be applied to pretty much any specific fight mechanics and then you can decide for your own.<br>
<br>
All in all boar's speed does look very powerful, however it is obviously situational and its benefit depends greatly on the fight.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_606141"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->To people arguing over that Boar's isn't "the bestest evar!": Of course it's not. You have two enchants which are neither great nor shit - Boar's and Vit. Both improve your raiding. Vitality isn't worth anything unless you actually <i>need</i> those 4 mp5. Boar's is a little stamina(Always good. You have a lot of fights where 10k hp is the bare minimum in BT/MH) and it's a little run speed. If you ever have been chased by a Doomfire on Archy, you will know how much you love this enchant. It gets you back to the action faster, it gets you away from the suffering faster. There are not a lot of fights where you have to run, but in T6 content you are probably not in need of those 4 mp5 either.<br>
<br>
Anything that helps on Archy wins tbh. This is almost the old 8/053 vs. 0/5/56 discussion. Not taking 10% of fire/frost/nature damage will never be very important, it's just nice.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_606361"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->The reason we are having this debate over Boar's vs. Vitality is due to the fact that neither is great. <br>
<br>
Given some early 25 man gear (some SSC/Eye) with a flask/oil/BoW/water shield/mana spring/food it's not that hard to be running with 350-400 mp5 of which vitality would represent just about a 1% boost . Now any increase in Mp5 is good but relative to the quantity of total regen it's impact is minor, 480 mana/10 min or another big heal. <br>
<br>
While one heal can make or break a raid for sure, generally if one heal from one player is the deal breaker your raid has other issues. Which is where Boar's comes into play preventing those "other issues". While it is agreed that the speed increase is only situationally beneficial not getting caught in Aoe's or getting back in range faster can be huge when   required. <br>
<br>
So the question becomes would i like another heal or two, or easier an time avoiding some effects/ wider margin of error on others?<br>
<br>
As was noted above this does echo the 8/0/53 vs 0/5/56 debate, in my view as the speed boost is more useful as it represents a sometimes useful bonus that i have none of, where as i already have lots of mp5. Again neither is ultimately superior in all cases.<br>
<br>
But at the end of the day i'd recommend Boar's on your first good set of epic healing boots.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_606937"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I agree about Boar`s Speed being overall a little better than Vitality. <br>
I have prefered Vitality up to now because I am a notorious MP5 junkie you could say. But there are some fights where some movement speed can help you and stam doesnt hurt either - and 4 MP5 really isnt that much on the other hand.<br>
Also you move faster through the auction house. :P<br>
<br>
I wonder about one thing though. Some ppl talked about downranking CH to Rank 4 for better mana efficiency. I know Rank 4 is more mana efficient than Rank 5, but do you really do that/use it often? I dont see any need for it actually. Sure, I downrank HW - usually to Rank 8 for spamming occasionally. LHW I dont downrank but use it rarely in PvE anyway But I just feel like CH 5 is usually so good that downranking seems to be unneccessary. I dont get mana problems either. I rather drink a mana potion on some fights than lose power on CH.<br>
Any thoughts on that?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_609844"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Thanks Skyhoof for all the efforts you have put into this.<br>
<br>
I think you may be overvaluing int for your gear rankings.<br>
<br>
If I look at what one point of int gives me (assuming BoK), I get:<br>
0.33 heal + 0.3036 crit + 16.5 mana<br>
<br>
Now if I assuming I’m gearing up for an 8 minute boss fight (don’t ask me why I chose 8 minutes), that 16.5 mana gets 2 mana tides added to it for 24.42 mana or the equivalent of 0.254375 mp5<br>
<br>
So the formula for one point of int is now<br>
0.33 heal + 0.3036 crit + 0.254375 mp5<br>
<br>
Crit, although less reliable, can be directly theorycrafted into heal (assuming you don’t assess a penalty to it, and assuming a 2000+heal shaman)…1 crit is the equivalent of .452899 heal.<br>
<br>
MP/5, can’t be perfectly converted into +heal but if I use your number of 3.75 mp5 to 1 heal, I get a ratio of .293333<br>
<br>
So just using heal, I get a point of int with BoK is:<br>
0.33 heal + 0.1375 heal + 0.074617 heal = 0.542117 heal.<br>
<br>
Using the numbers above, your ranking numbers of:<br>
Stam = 0.30 <br>
Int = 0.75 <br>
Spirit = 0.1 <br>
Healing = 1.1 <br>
Crit = 0.5 <br>
Mp5 = 3.75 <br>
Haste = 0.75 <br>
Armor = 0.01<br>
<br>
Become:<br>
Stam = 0.30 <br>
Int = 0.596328333<br>
Spirit = 0.1 <br>
Healing = 1.1 <br>
Crit = 0.5 (actually 0.4988 so you are right on there).<br>
Mp5 = 3.75 <br>
Haste = 0.75 <br>
Armor = 0.01<br>
<br>
The tricky number is the Mp5 number…basically if you value 3.75 mp5 MORE than 1.1 healing, then the coefficient for int would increase…if you valued it less, it would decrease.<br>
<br>
Hope this helps,<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Going for +heal is probably the best thing, regardless of gear level. You get lots and lots of mp5 from talents and spells <i>and</i> by having a huge amount of +heal you can downrank to endure. +heal equals mp5 in situations where you need to output X HPS over Y seconds as mana saved equals mp5.<br>
<br>
+heal also allows you to go all in when you have a shadow priest. I'm a lazy bastard and like some regen items, but +heal is king. You hop on the haste wagon for some fights in BT which basically is gaining more from your +heal at the expense of your regen.</div>

</div>Even if you bring 2 hunters and a feral dps druid, I still think the 12 points are best spent on the totems versus other talents.  <br>
<br>
Again, I want to qualify that this spec is only valid if you have at least 3 people in a party that it would benefit and I thoroughly believe it is only best for mature raiding (Once the steep cliff of the learning curve has been put behind you) where mistakes are few and far between. <br>
<br>
I definitely think though that there are plenty of guilds that have at least 2 hunters and a dps druid or 3 hunters on their 25 man raids.  Even if you end up in a melee group, the improved totems will still help.  I think the only place this spec will not improve a raid is in a caster or healer group.  If that is where you usually end up, then yes, there are 12 wasted points in the tree.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I think you may be overvaluing int for your gear rankings.</div>

</div>You would probably be shocked if you knew how little math went into arriving at those values. I basically worked backwards. For example, I ranked all the weapons in the game (based on my gut). Then I went back and said what values would I have to assign to generate this ranking? I did this with all item slots until I arrived at the current values. So it's possible that I overvalued Intellect. Let's take a look at the math.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Now if I assuming I’m gearing up for an 8 minute boss fight (don’t ask me why I chose 8 minutes), that 16.5 mana gets 2 mana tides added to it for 24.42 mana or the equivalent of 0.254375 mp5<br>
<br>
So the formula for one point of int is now<br>
0.33 heal + 0.3036 crit + 0.254375 mp5</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>An 8-minute fight works for me. However, I think one Mana Tide is more realistic. That changes the mp5 to .2148<br>
<br>
So the forumla for int becomes <br>
1 int = 0.33 heal + 0.3036 crit + 0.2131 mp5<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Crit, although less reliable, can be directly theorycrafted into heal (assuming you don’t assess a penalty to it, and assuming a 2000+heal shaman)…1 crit is the equivalent of .452899 heal.<br>

</div>I think you meant to say that using my value of 1.1 heal = 3.75 mp5 you get .293333<br>

Mp5 = 3.75 <br>
Haste = 0.75 <br>
Armor = 0.01<br>
<br>
The tricky number is the Mp5 number…basically if you value 3.75 mp5 MORE than 1.1 healing, then the coefficient for int would increase…if you valued it less, it would decrease.</div>

	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>So using my 1 mana tide, my Intellect value would become<br>
Int = 0.583<br>
<br>
So either way it does appear that Intellect is overvalued -- at least mathematically. However, let's look at the practical implications. If Int = 0.60 then the <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=31304" target="_blank">[The Essence Focuser]</a> becomes better than the <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=27538" target="_blank">[Lightsworn Hammer]</a>. And I think +12 stam and +11 Intellect is more valuable than + 3 mp5. So if we adjust Intellect to .60, then we would probably have to adjust mp5 to 3.25.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Hard to say. I believe it's fundamentally wrong to evaluate mp5 with a fixed value, because you want to reach a level X where X is what you need to cast the spells you need during a fight. When X is reached, you can focus purely on +heal. But! If you focus purely on +heal, you can gain a form of regen from it. You have a hell of a lot of regen available to you during raids(not just a spriest) and with &gt;2k +heal, you can down rank your spam and still be very effective.<br>
<br>
2.3 changed regen for shamans. We used to be a mp5 dependent class, but with the Water Shield changes(both of them) and the buff to Manaspring, we are free to focus more on +heal.</div>

		<div id="post_message_609927">The one thing that I find interesting in reading through this entire thread is the lack of attention paid to the 0/12/49 spec.  <br>
<br>
The improvements to a hunter/druid group while minor are better for a raid then the fact that I'd take 10% less damage from elemental spells.  On how many fights is that 10% difference truly going to matter?  I know that since I have been using it (Over 0/0/61) the hunters have improved their damage numbers, I haven't died any more, and my healing numbers remain the same.  <br>
<br>
Loosing Nature's Guardian is not a huge loss as usually by the time it is going to proc, I'm going to die anyway.<br>
<br>
Loosing Healing Grace is easy.  In the days of hunter misdirects, if you are pulling aggro in a fight, you need to replace your hunters or your tank.<br>
<br>
I took the other points from Imp. Reincarnation and Totemic Focus.  With the buff to Water Shield, the cost of totems is almost negligible.  Imp. Reincarnation hurts a little bit (I still have 1/2) but again, this is a talent that you are usually only using if you have screwed up.  Making fewer mistakes in raids will make this talent less of a benefit.  I think I've used an ankh once in my last 4 BT/MH raids.<br>
<br>
While I agree that 8/0/53 or 0/0/61 are better specs for some fights at some time, particularly where you or your guild are learning the encounters, I honestly think that as your guild progresses, it is better to go 0/12/49 and place yourself in a group of hunters/feral druids.</div>

		<div id="post_message_610166">My raid group is probably somewhat atypical, and we run a steady, consistent hunter group (we have 5 very solid hunters, and always have 3 in raid) that includes me and a feral druid.  We have only one shadow priest, and I don't get him basically ever.  So, I thought - might be worth considering this 0/12/49 build, and I spent some time working out the details today.  In my opinion, 8/0/53 remains a vastly superior build.  Others may make a different decision, but I thought I would put my calculations out there to save others making this decision the time.  Here's the basic set up:<br>
<br>
Assuming a group of 3 hunters doing approximately 1.1k DPS each (all BM), with a feral druid doing 850.  10 minute fight, constant totem and DPS uptime.  Working from Cheeky's spreadsheet, our best hunter calculates that, including kings, he would gain roughly 10 DPS total (himself and pet) from the 13 str and 11 agility from improved totems.  Our feral druid calculated his DPS increase at 15-20, assuming 14 AP = 1 DPS, and that he gains .7% crit from the agility.  I didn't check these numbers individually, so feel free to refine them as necessary.  That gives, at the high end, a 50 DPS increase to the group as a whole.  Over a 10 minute fight, the overall increase is 30k damage.<br>
<br>
Given that I'm currently 8/0/53, I'd have to give up two useful talents (neither core, but both boosting survivability) in Nature's Guardian and Elemental Warding to gain 30k damage over each boss fight (again, assuming 100% uptime on both DPS and totem buffs).  To me, increased personal survival vastly outweighs the DPS increase and mana gain from 0/12/49, which has a minimum of 5 wasted points (T2 enhancement) which have no raiding value whatsoever.   This aside from the fact that most shaman consider Ancestral Knowledge a subpar talent, so you could reasonably argue that you give up 12 talent points for a 50 DPS upgrade in the BEST possible group for a 0/12/49 shaman.  Based on all these factors I think that 0/12/49 is dramatically underwhelming compared to more traditional healing builds.<br>
<br>
Edit - Tt occurs to me that this is for a group at the entry-into-T6 phase.  Certainly once BT is on farm and you and your group are using T6+ gear there could be a different interpretation, and I'd love to see some numbers on that.  I would guess, though, that the marginal value of 11-13 Str/Agi are going to go DOWN with increasing gear, not up.  Would be interesting to see if others get a similar interpretation from their guildmate/math.</div>

</div>Sorry, I was using the WWS to show the damage I was taking that night, and why elemental warding was not as worth while.<br>

I can also tell you Daidalos is using the same 0/12/49 spec right now.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304051524/http://www.wowarmory.com/character-talents.xml?r=Korgath&amp;n=Daidalos" target="_blank">http://www.wowarmory.com/character-t...ath&amp;n=Daidalos</a><br>

</div>Thanks, Ranalis. This sort of analysis was exactly what I was hoping someone would post. And the DPS boost is a bit underwhelming. There is nothing wrong with the 0/12/49 spec it's just you're not getting a whole lot for the talents you give up. And I would have to agree that as the quality of gear improves, the DPS added by the totems would decrease (at least on a percentage basis).<br>
<br>
So, I suppose if all you did was raid with hunters and druids and you never do any PVP or farming, then the spec would be OK. However, the 5% increase in damage to shocks and bolts is nice when farming. The threat reduction is nice for 5-mans and 10-mans and trash pulls that go bad (Oh, I thought you were sheeping the square!). And Nature's Guardian is awesome for PVP and staying alive until the warrior taunts, the hunter misdirects or your shadow priest pulls aggro with that mind blast.</div>

</div>OK, I'll post in the hunter thread to see what they estimate as the DPS boost. And tell Daidalos to get on here and explain this spec. Especially why he put 2 points into improved reincarnation. There must be something we are missing. I'm sure it will all make sense after he walks us through it. Afterall, I did think he was a bit crazy when he started wearing T2 to boost his chain heal. It just so happened that it was an amazing idea that works very well for several fights.<br>

</div>Based on my analysis that's definitely true - it has most of the things you'd want and depending on your feelings about the DPS increase, I feel I could respecc 0/12/49 and do similarly well in terms of healing to my current 8/0/53 spec.  I just don't feel I can personally give up the survivability to do so (at least given my gear and relative knowledge of T6 fights at the moment).  It was definitely a good idea to have the discussion on this spec, though, and I'm really glad to have had the chance to think it through clearly.</div>

</div>Well, seeing some more feedback from hunters on this spec will also go a long way.  And I agree, if you feel you can't give up survivability, I definitely would not recommend the spec to you.  Of course the flip side is true, that if you can afford the survivability, it can't hurt to have the extra dps.  The fact is, 50 dps isn't going to make or break a raid, but there isn't anything that truly is make or  break on a raid.  If I take my +81 healing off my weapon, it isn't going to hurt my healing that much.  If I take the healing off my shoulders, it won't hurt that much.

70 Intellect = 1% crit = 22.08 crit rating<br>
With BoK, I would need 63.6 Intellect to get 1% crit so 22.08/63.6 = 0.3472<br>

So the forumla for int becomes (assuming I did the math correctly on crit)<br>
1 int = 0.33 heal + 0.3472 crit + 0.2148 mp5<br></div>

</div>I got it from wowwiki:<br>
Every class except Warlocks uses: (Intellect/80) + (Spell Critical Strike Rating/22.08) + Class Specific Constant<br>
...so every 80 Int gives you 1% crit and with BoK it would be 72.72727<br>
and with 1 mana tide, I get 0.213125 mp5 with BoK 1.1( (15 mana * 1.24 for mana tide * 5 per sec)/480 sec)<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I think you meant to say that using my value of 1.1 heal = 3.75 mp5 you get .293333<br>
And using my values for crit and mp5 above you get<br>
<br>
1 int = 0.33 heal + 0.1572 heal (crit) + 0.0630 (mp5) = .5502 healing (you got 0.542117 heal)<br>
<br>
So using my 1 mana tide and different crit value, my Intellect value would become<br>
Int = 0.60522<br>
<br>
So either way it does appear that Intellect is overvalued -- at least mathematically. However, let's look at the practical implications. If Int = 0.60 then the <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=31304"><span><span class="bluename">[The Essence Focuser]</span></span></a> becomes better than the <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=27538"><span><span class="bluename">[Lightsworn Hammer]</span></span></a>. And I think +12 stam and +11 Intellect is more valuable than + 3 mp5. So if we adjust Intellect to .60, then we would probably have to adjust mp5 to 3.25. <br>
<br>
So that would change the formula to...<br>
<br>
1 int = 0.33 heal + 0.1572 heal (crit) + 0.07270 (mp5) = .5599 healing <br>
<br>
Let me know what you think.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>With one mana tide, I get<br>
1 int = .33 heal + .1375 heal (crit) + .062517 heal (mp5) = .530017 healing<br>
<br>
I'm guessing that the ranking issues may potentially come from how mp5 is valued but that number is so subjective and situation dependent (e.g., do you have an spriest, etc.) I'm not sure what to say.<br>
<br>
If I look at how dps classes that use mana like enh shaman and hunters calculate AEP, they don't seem to include mp5/regen in their calculations at all...for resto shaman its a little more complex because when a hunter or enh shaman run out of mana, they can still do white damage...when a resto shaman runs out of mana, people die <br>
<br>
I've found your rankings very helpful and have gotten to the point now where I look at an item and see if it is an upgrade to my max heal/haste/crit set or my regen set before I figure out if I want to roll on it.<br>
<br>
Thanks again,<br>

</div>Well, the thing with improved reincarnation should be easily explained. Some raiding shamans seem to like it since ankhing up isnt really important for wipe protection in raids.<br>
 So usually you reincarnate during boss fights should you die. Therefore some shamans seem to like buying the improved reincarnation so you get up with some more HP and mana and can do it more often - easy explanation. <br>
In the early days of BC the "standard spec" of Nihilum`s shamans included it too btw. Just a matter of taste tbh. I never liked the talent.</div>

If you arent in a raid group which usually takes an enhancement shaman with it or you usually have really many hunters (at least 3) every raid it should work I guess.<br>
Otherwise the enhancement shaman will be in the group with rogues and dps warriors - so those are taken. The feral druid(s) might be in that group too depending on overall setup. That would leave only hunters and maybe a feral druid for the shaman`s group.<br>

</div>Or how much gold you and your guild have to pay for respecs. While the DPS boost is small, Sham is correct in pointing out most of the ways we boost DPS and healing are small but have a large cumulative effect. <br>
<br>
I'm really glad Sham brought up this spec and have added it to the list on the first page. If I'm ever put in the hunter/druid group for the night, I can say to my guild, "Do you want me to respec to get improved strength and agility totems? It will boost the DPS of the group by about 50 DPS. I won't lose any of my healing abilities but I will take more damage." <br>
<br>
There wasn't much feedback from the hunters, which is surprising because they seem obsessed with maximizing their DPS. The analysis that Ranalis and his guild did seems to be accurate.</div>

		<div id="post_message_611488">I collborated with some hunters before speccing to but subsequently forgot all numbers involved since that was ages ago.  So I was no better off than you guys right now.  I can say from extensive experience (from Vashj-Illidan) I don't feel I have gimped myself at all.  I have been raiding with this spec since we were starting on vashj over 7 months ago.   I have found the spec to be decent in bgs for the imp grounding and a very buff-oriented spec which "feels" right to me as my role as a shaman.  I do find the elemental spec for those times when I chuck LB as resto appealing like on RoS and Akama I have thought about speccing this way since I have been the caster group alot lately but I never know when I"ll end up in the hunter or tank group (the little extra agi for prot wars gives a little bit of extra dodge as well as the all around benefits to a feral tank).  My only reply to those who feel they are giving up somthing by speccing to this is "stop standing in fires" ;-)</div>

Sure maybe once in BT once in hyjal clear and plenty of times I haven't died at all.  You saying you never die?  If you don't want to thats fine. It works for me and for my guild.</div>

<br>
Nature's Guardian procced exactly *3* times the entire night.<br>
<br>
2 of those were on High Warlord Najentus.  Neither of those made a difference in terms of saving him due to the nature of the fight.  <br>
<br>
Daidalos took a total of 237k damage that would have been mitigated by elemental warding.  23,700 additional damage throughout a 4 hour raid.  Of all his deaths, only the first was one that might have been mitigated by elemental warding, and that is assuming that a heal would have landed OR a tank/lock would have banished the elemental that decided to melt his face.<br>
<br>
Daidalos chose 2/2 imp reinc and 2/2 Nature's Guardian.  I took 1/2 imp reinc (Because there really was no where else worth the point) and 3/3 Focused mind.  I did this explicitly to compliment Daidalos in his spec.  It is for the exact same reason that one of us stays full shadow and one stays full healing on Azgalor.  <br>
<br>
The other thing that is being missed in the DPS discussion is the effect of the additional agility on the entire raid with a Survival hunter and expose weakness.  Again, it is small, but it adds up.<br>
<br>
So, the net result is trading 30k of damage over the night for 30k damage every 10 minutes for the raid.  To me, that seems to be a no brainer.<br>
<br>
When you also realize that as raid dps goes up, the need for survivability drops, it is a win - win situation, provided (As we've stated repeatedly) that you don't need the survivability AND you are routinely grouping with hunters and feral druids.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_612331"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->The 0-12-49 spec is completely viable for raiding. I'll admit I was a bit skeptical when Shamanaut first posted but when you look at the WWS data you can see there's no drop in their ability to heal.

I'm keeping my spec 8-0-53 at the moment. It works for me given that I like to occassionally PVP without respeccing and do a lot of healing in 5-mans and 10-mans where aggro is an issue. However, I would not hesitate to respec 0-12-49 should I suddenly find myself in a party with a bunch of hunters and feral druids for the night. It would be 100 gold well spent to boost DPS. <br>

What makes this game so interesting is that there is not one way to succeed. You can play your class in several ways and still be an effective healer -- as Daidalos and Shamanaut have proven.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">The 0-12-49 spec is completely viable for raiding. I'll admit I was a bit skeptical when Shamanaut first posted but when you look at the WWS data you can see there's no drop in their ability to heal.

</div>That is, until someone else figures out another tweak to the spec sheet and shows a different way to heal even better.  Or blizzard tweaks something in the tree and sends months of theorycrafting down the drain. <br>
<br>
I can definitely tell you that mages *HATE* 8-0-53 in PvP.  The most important thing to realize is exactly what was said  about there being different ways to succeed.  The hardest part is becoming a master of all of them and understanding each.  I truly understand the 8-0-53 and 0-0-61 specs and what they bring.  I used to run 0-0-61.  <br>
<br>
One of these days when I know we can afford it, I might go 8-0-53 for a few weeks just to compare the survivability numbers directly to Daidalos' on the same raid.  It would definitely provide the best direct comparison of the two specs on the same raid.  It would probably provide the most meaningful numbers for this discussion.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Well, uncommon gems are 6 item points, rare gems are 8 item points and epic gems are 10 item points.  <br>
<br>
The Royals are anomalous.  Mana/5 is valued at about 2.5 item points per mana/5.  So the green lustrous gem is 2 mana/5, the blue lustrous gem is 3 mana/5, and the epic gem is 4 mana/5.<br>
<br>
Each combination color gem uses 1/2 of the value of each regular gem.  So in the case of royals you should have have<br>
<br>
Royal Shadow Draenite: 7 healing 1 mana/5<br>
Royal Nightseye: 9 healing, 1.5 mana/5<br>
Royal Shadowsong Amethyst: 11 healing, 2 mana/5<br>
<br>
But of course you can't have half a mana/5.  So they round it up.  This makes royal nightseye overbudget.  And in fact, it's probably the best blue gem you can get as a healer because of that.<br>
<br>
But that means when you get to epic gems, and it's back into the correct budget, it looks less appealing, and that is when healers start to see other gems look more appealing.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>If that's true then the value of Int in the stat weights should be .9167 (based on 1.1 healing) -- meaning it was undervalued originally. As I mentioned in an earlier post, I'm working on a set of stat weights for shaman at entry-level (T4), mid-level (T5) and end-game (T6). The value arrived at for Int using this mathematical method might be a good value to use for the entry-level stat weights. My "gear-based" method came up with a value of 1.0 for Intellect at the entry-level. But the T4 model also values +healing at 1.0.<br>
<br>
I'll try to get the new stat weights up once I run a few more simulations. However, I can't see giving Intellect more weight for a shaman at the mid-point in the game. Thoughts?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I thorougly agree.  You can not just assign a flat value for mp5 and int.  <br>
<br>
Both of these stats have a diminishing return.  When you are no longer running out of mana, additional mp5 is worthless, and int is simply a crit boost and nothing more.  I think that is the biggest thing that is currently overlooked in all of the formula's I see thrown around for theorycrafting.  They simply do not account for this diminishing return so you see people with 350 or more mp5 while raid buffed searching for more.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>The way I see haste is, it's not flat out better than mp5 gear. It is, however, better in situations where you don't have any mana problems. Basically, if you're in a shadow priest group then a lot of your mp5 gear is wasted and should be partially replaced by haste gear. So, in addition to stacking +heal in situations where mana is not an issue you can also stack haste which provides a nice increase to your hps.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
Seriously though, take a look at the WWS I posted for Daidalos up at the top of page 13.  He is using a max haste set for most of the trash, and switching to a set with less haste for longer boss encounters.<br>
<br>
The interesting thing about haste is that it has a similar effect to +heal in increasing your total output during encounter, but it ALSO reduces the effect of mp5 and int as it increases burn rate.  As haste goes up, your need for mp5 and/or int will increase.  <br>
<br>
I'd be curious as to some of the numbers that the more mathematically inclined in this thread would come up with for a reasonably well geared (Think 2000 +heal and 250 mp5 raid buffed) shaman could expect to use when valuing haste on items.<br>
<br>
The other thing to realize is haste does NOTHING for LHW as you are already pounding on the GCD.  So if you are one of the shaman that are using LHW more then the average shaman (I'd say 10-15% of your casts), the value of haste would be less compared to a shaman who uses it for 2-3% of their casts.<br>
<br>
I also asked Daidalos to post his opinions on this, as he definitely has a better haste set then I do.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_613587"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->While you might say you need more int/mp5 with more haste, the fact is if you even think about int/mp5 you probably don't want to gear haste in the firstplace. If you ever think about "hmm is casting that heal really worth that mana now?" you're not really benefiting from haste all that much, but would benefit from more mana efficiency (which btw includes +healing as it increases efficiency).<br>
If you really want high on-demand HPS but can't afford to lose the efficiency you lose when using haste gear, +healing gets very powerful in comparison to other stats. You will need less mana to do the same healing and have more burst ability. Haste will, however, increase your burst a lot more than +healing would (due to itemization costs), but not increase your efficiency thus still requiring the same mana to do a certain amount of healing.<br>
<br>
I wouldn't look at haste as something that increases burn rate, but rather something that increases HPS without increasing efficiency, while mana increases efficiency and doesn't increase HPS, and +healing increases both. At the end it really depends on 1. what you actually need and 2. what you currently have available (as in, shadow priest+pots would greatly increase the value of +healing over mp5 even for pure efficiency ignoring hps, how much though depends on exactly how much +healing etc you have).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_613597"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I probably worded that wrong.  I believe what I meant to say is <br>
<br>
"As your haste goes up, your valuation of int and mp5 will also increase.  This value is still subject to the diminishing valuation of int/mp5 as your total int/mp5 reaches a level that you are no longer seeing a benefit from this stat in raiding"<br>
<br>
Basically, for the mathematically inclined, a higher personal haste rating would reduce the rate at which mp5/int values approach zero.  A shaman with 0 haste may find that they need only 250 mp5 to no longer require anymore mp5, while one with 150 haste may find the zero point of mp5 closer to 300 mp5.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_613616"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I do understand situational value of haste gear but thats not what Im after.<br>
<br>
Like pointed out on longer fights MP5 comes more valuable. Also SP does give you nicely mana but that usually not the case at the end of fight when he might struckle with mana himself or be dead.<br>
<br>
Why I ask this is due to fact trying to be better/faster healer. I do use a lot LHW, fights like Illidan and Council its more than 50% overall healing done. I personally feel that shamans and priests with CoH are primary random healers and their job is to keep ppl up while paladins and druids focus more on tanks.<br>
<br>
Atm it isnt really that I dont manage to heal ppl in time, I do really well and dont lack mana at all, but having 10% haste would possible let me focus more single target CH with additional jumps and if working well increase HPS around 10%.<br>
<br>
That WWS data posted shows really not much, would prefer more individual fights. I see high amount of CH spam, but HPS amounts doesnt impress at all if that is counting overheals. Personally on average I put over 1k hps effective all the time on trash, around 1.1 to 1.4k hps on LHW heavy fights and over 1.6k fights like teron and bloodboil when random healing (from combat meters over whole fight time).<br>
<br>
So, back to original question. Even if SP on group and using pots, would it be effective heal with haste gear on "normal" fights and heal more than with mp5 gear.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

If you don't need to reduce your cast-time, you don't need haste. HPS can be gained by +heal. +heal also doubles as regen when your HPS demand is low because of downranking. The way I see it, you need haste gear when you have maxed out your +heal set and still want more HPS. Trying 5 healers for a full BT clear or something.

</div>This might be nothing more then my opinion, but stop the LHW spam.  I know you are using CH for the flames phase, and if you aren't then you are really REALLY wrong.  In the rest of the fight, about the only point where LHW is worth it is a flame burst coupled with the flame debuff.  No where else in the fight are you going to loose someone if they get that heal 1 second later, and you are killing efficiency.  Especially on one of the longest fights in the game where efficiency matters.  <br>
<br>
On council, let a paladin worry about the raid in general.  Their FoL spell is efficient, our 1.5 second cast isn't.  The raid would do better with you being an MT healer and the paladin being the raid healer.  Especially since CH on the MT of the melee group will also help heal their random damage, and as long as the MT is about 55-60% health, you can afford to use CH instead of HW (But don't let healing way drop off the MT).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Have to disagree on paladin being better random healer than shaman. I agree that shamans and priest have armor debuff but they do also heal tanks when spare time or needed. Paladin tho has flash of light and atleast our paladin setup doesnt allow BoL on all ppl which makes it heal like 1.3k? while shamans do heal around 2.2 to 2.3k. Also specially if you have SP in your group spamming LHW even nearly whole fight wont be much problem. Side note tho that we also use shaman to heal paladin tank on council cause CH melee healing effectineves.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Even if you are random targeting, only the first heal will land sooner.  Every other heal will still be 1.5 seconds after that. <br>
<br>
Assuming your haste gets your LHW to 1.0 seconds exactly, your heals will be at <br>
<br>
1.0<br>
2.5<br>
4.0<br>
5.5<br>
7.0<br>
8.5<br>
10.0<br>
<br>
With no haste your heals are at <br>
1.5<br>
3.0<br>
4.5<br>
6.0<br>
7.5<br>
9.0<br>
10.5<br>
<br>
Assume you do 2k per LHW.  That means your HPS in the first example is 14000/10 = 1400.  In the second it is 14000/10.5 = 1333.  You've basically gained 67 HPS in a 10 second fight.  This gain falls dramatically as the fight goes on and approaches 0 rapidly.  Maybe, just maybe you'd save a tank at some point and therefore save the raid with the faster LHW, but I can't see it. Compare that to Chain heals where dropping from 2.5 to 2.0 seconds would have a dramatic effect.  Heals in the same fight would be at<br>
<br>
2.0<br>
4.0<br>
6.0<br>
8.0<br>
10.0 <br>
<br>
and with no haste<br>
<br>
2.5<br>
5.0<br>
7.5<br>
10.0<br>
<br>
Assuming each chain heal was for 4k total, you would have 2000 HPS in the first example and 1600 in the second.  And this spread would remain throughout the entire fight.  That means your haste is increasing your chain heal (Or healing wave) in direct proportion to the reduction of cast time (In this case a 25% increase in HPS is a result of a 25% faster cast time).  A 33% decrease in cast time of LHW only increases HPS by 5% on a short fight and on a longer fight it increases it by what is effectively zero.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_613688">Every time you "stop casting" (move, or simply don't need to heal anything) it's like "starting the fight over" using the above model. The benefits are still quite small for 1.5s spells, though.<br>
<br>
+healing doubles as regen by allowing downranking via the extra hps it gives, however haste also does that. +healing obviously increases your efficiency a lot more as the main benefit is the extra healing/mana done, the extra efficiency from allowing to downrank more / more often is rather a side effect (that is small, but not negligible).<br>
<br>
Bottom line is if it's possible to go oom, haste is wasted, as you would use all your mana to heal wether you had haste or not, doing the same healing done. If it's impossible to go oom, regen is wasted as you don't use that extra mana to heal more anyway. Of course there's the slight side-effect of haste giving more burst that even if you're hurting for mana, you could possibly let other healers do more in "healing-light" phases and you do more in the "intensive spam heal and not care about mana or ppl die" phases using the mana you saved up. However this is rarely useful and even when it is its usefullness is small. <b>Haste is primarily a "I can't use all my mana might as well increase HPS" stat.</b></div>

</div>No.  No it is not like starting over.  In fact, it completely eliminates haste as a factor for LHW. <br>
<br>
Say you cast LHW every 3 seconds.<br>
<br>
Your heals then would land at <br>
<br>
1.5<br>
4.5<br>
7.5<br>
10.5<br>
<br>
With a 33% increase your heals would land at <br>
<br>
1.0<br>
4.0<br>
7.0<br>
10.0<br>
<br>
There is NO HPS gain at all from this.  None.  You are landing the same amount of healing in the same amount of time.<br>
The heal itself being faster in this case does nothing but perhaps increase your effective healing at the expense of jacking some other healer.  You decrease your overheal and increase theirs with no effective change in your HPS or improvement in the raids HPS.  <br>

You might look better, but you are robbing Peter to pay Paul.</div>

</div>If making the heal land sooner doesn't do anything useful, you probably shouldn't have been casting LHW in the first place.

</div>I can't really agree with that at all.  At least in my experiences, there's a billion times that someone dies as I'm casting a heal on them.  To say you're robbing someone assumes that you have someone that's going to land a heal there in time to save the person, and while that might be true most times, it isn't 100% of the time.<br>
<br>
To carry that further, assuming you're using chain heals excusively, I'd venture to say that your 2nd and 3rd jumps on your chain heals are jacking a poor paladin who's single target healing that person.  <br>
<br>
My guess is that your raids tend to go very smoothly and controlled so damage is much more predictable.  If that's the case, you're most likely right.  However, in my guild's case, damage flows like money tossed out of a tower because everyone gets smacked all over by it.    Definitely a YMMV kind of thing, but it's very raid dependant imo.</div>

</div>We're talking tenths of seconds here, not the 1 second faster improvement from switching between HW and LHW.  Remember too that the switch from HW to LHW without haste will not hit the GCD limit on casting speed.  For all of those reasons, you would use LHW when you ended up in that panic mode of "I need to get the heal there now".  So yes, haste might apply to that limited subset of times where getting the LHW there quicker saves the raid.  It however does not improve HPS at all, and a shaman that is casting 20-30% LHW is using LHW as a support healing role, not as a "Save" role as there simply are not that many times in a raid where the saving someone aspects of LHW exist.  I won't disagree that the value of haste to a raid and LHW isn't 0.  But it is awfully close.<br>
<br>
The purpose of healing in a raid encounter is maximizing HPS throughout the encounter, while maintaining sufficient efficiency to not go out of mana.  The more you can do this the better healer you will be.  The brief moments where you get the opportunity to make the save are not what anyone should be speccing for.    <br>
<br>
Of course, if NS was on a zero cooldown I'd use it on every single cast, regardless of spell.  This would change the entire dynamic of the fight from other healers perspectives.  The spells they choose would become different.  The thing is, I still wouldn't be using LHW.<br>
<br>
The problem here is relying on a shaman to be the fast healer using an inefficient spell compared to paladins who do have a relatively efficient fast spell.  We loose 40% efficiency by casting faster.  Paladins loose 10-15%.  In the old days (Pre TBC and the CH targeting change) this was exactly what shamans did, specifically because the horde didn't HAVE another 1.5 second heal.  The inefficiencies were acceptable because there is a need for small fast heals in a raid.  Coupled with a Chain heal that was almost worthless as it's jumps were not intelligent, LHW made sense.  This sort of mentality however needs to change.  Using inefficient heals in the raid, when more efficient heals exists means that you are limiting your raid.  You are either bringing too many healers, which hurts DPS, to make up for the efficiency drop, or your healers themselves are using bad gear specs (More MP5 and less heal) to increase their duration.  The efficiency increase between LHW and HW/CH is significantly better then a Paladin's increase between FoL and HL.  Does it eliminate entirely the need for LHW?  No.  LHW delivers a bigger punch then FoL, and sometimes that is necessary for the saving aspect of LHW.  But it shouldn't be necessary for LHW to fill the continual small heal requirements of a raid.   Remember, for raid content, it isn't about individual performance, it is about raid performance.  If we are forcing the raid to perform worse for our own benefit, is it really better?  Ask the warlock who puts up CoA instead of CoR with a 10 melee raid.  And then see how long he keeps getting invites if he doesn't learn.  The exact same thing applies here, but since healing breakdowns aren't as easy to spot in reports as dps breakdowns, the problem of healers relying on incorrect heals goes undetected.</div>

</div>No.  I wouldn't be jacking the poor paladin.  Say 3 rogues and the MT take damage.  I start proccing a CH on the MT.  The paladin subsequently starts casting a FoL on rogue 1.  That FoL will land 1 full second before my CH, which instead would jump to rogues 2 and 3.  I *MAY* jack the paladins second heal, but that is only because he is casting a heal that at best could land 3 seconds after my 2.5 second heal started casting.  To me, jacking a heal is when you cast that 1.5 second heal 3/4ths of a second after your priest starts a low rank greater heal or something along those lines.  When you needlessly force someone else to overheal.<br>
<br>
I can't argue with you that in the types of raids you seem to have, the value of LHW is increased.  The problem is, is that really the type of raid most people are experiencing?<br>
<br>
If your raids are such that people are repeatedly dying while your 1.5 second heal is inbound, and if dropping that heal to 1.2 seconds would save them, I'd argue that your raids have much bigger problems then haste rating for your healers.  If anything, improving your healers overall efficiency and fixing your guildmates inability to stay out of damage would go much further at making your raids better then the current situation which seems like your healing is nothing more then a string of going from emergency to emergency.  Backing down on DPS so people don't pull aggro (Which I'm guessing is the majority of the reason your raids are so chaotic) will cause encounters to last longer until the threat issues your tanks are having can be fixed.  That means a longer, but more stable encounter.  And that means more chance of success and more need for healing efficiency.<br>
<br>
Would you mind posting some WWS's of your raids? I'm really curious to take a look at what is going on there.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">It looks like you are turning that ratio around. The numbers you referenced are stat weights, and using the numbers provided in this thread of 3.75 for mp5 and 1.1 for +healing, you'd get a ratio of 3.41 heal per mp5, meaning your are underevaluating the mana portion of int by a factor of 10 or more.<br>
<br>
Thus,<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
should be:<br>
<br>
1 int = .33 heal + .1375 heal (crit) + 0.72675625 heal (3.41 heal/mp5 * 0.213125 mp5) = 1.19425625 healing</div>

</div>Correct...my bad, I flipped em. 1 int = 1.19425625 healing assuming the 1.1heal/3.75mp5 ratio.<br>
<br>
So it all boils back down to what you are gearing for...if it is max hps and mana is not a concern then you should use<br>
1 int = 0.4675 heal with BoK (notice I value mp/5 and mana at nothing here, and the applicable stats become heal, crit, int, and haste).<br>
<br>
After that it really depends on how much you value mp/5.<br>
<br>
Apologies for the earlier goof, and thanks for the catch.<br>

</div>I can see that, except the number is extremely small.  The benefit is only gained during the time your moving while in GCD.  I'm not saying it is totally useless, but the effect is so small that I doubt it can even be measured in meters in a real world scenario.  Lets say you drop your LHW to 1.2 seconds (Which is probably close to the theoretical maximum with gear currently in game) and need to move for 50% of a fight.  Assuming that, you get 30 seconds of casting every minute.  That would be 20 LHW's at 1.5 seconds or 25 at 1.2 seconds cast time .  That results in 5 additional LHW's per minute.  That equates to 166 HPS assuming a 2k LHW.  And that is in the most extreme case favoring haste that I can see even being conceivable and assumes perfect timing with moving as soon as your heal ends.  So yes, the effect isn't 0, but it requires extreme cases such as this to even show a benefit on LHW, and perfect play to boot.  This is the theorycrafted maximum that I could ever see (And I know of no fights that require 50% movement time that allow you to stop every 1.2 seconds to cast then require you to move again).</div>

</div>No, my WWS shows that I am a victim of WAY to much mp5.  Something I'm trying to correct.  As a result I just stand around and spam chain heals in anticipation of it doing something.  You read the reports exactly correct.  I am overhealing simply because I can't burn mana fast enough.<br>
<br>
Remember that WWS also shows individual jumps, so really my average chain heal is healing each person for that much per jump.  So it is 1200 effective heal * however many jumps it takes.  These are rank 4 and 5 casts.</div>

</div>I see no advantage to using LHW to top off a raid -- even if you are devoid of paladins and their flash heal. <br>
<br>
However, which heal to use becomes more complicated when we want to land a saving heal to prevent death. Someone has only a few hit points left and if they don't get a heal NOW, they are going to die. What do you cast? We'll assume that NS is on cooldown.<br>
<br>
If there are multiple healers on the target, I might cast LHW. My hope is that they are going to get multiple small heals in 1.5 seconds, which will give them enough health to survive the next blow, etc. But what if you have no idea if anyone else is going to heal the target? In that case, I use Chain Heal. If they have gotten that low, something is going wrong. They are probably not the only person taking damage. By casting chain heal, I not only give them more health but those around them. <br>

</div>My decision point for this is generally "How many other people are down a lot who shouldn't be".  If its 3 or 4 unexpected targets getting low, I will use Chain Heal because the likeliness of another healer also blowing a fast heal on the same target is low, plus the hope that a jump will occur.  If it is only 1 unexpected healing target, I will use LHW, mostly because I'm assuming there are multiple small heals inbound to that person, and odds are good my chain heal will be behind all of that and just be pure overheal.</div>

<br>
Is it beneficial or needed?  With the current content, probably not although it does help quite a bit for a 2 healer ZA setup.<br>

Regarding your previous post though, you can come up with examples for any situation.  For instance, what if the "poor pally" was mid-cast to heal a "random mage" while you wind up your CH.  Following the Pally's FoL, he swaps to FoL Rogue-1 who happens to receive your 2nd hit of CH healing him to full causing your Pally to 100% overheal.  <br>
<br>
I don't think such debates are very fruitful, but it all falls on the responsiveness of your healers along with the discipline of the raid....and without posting WWS (cuz my GL would kill me as there's some fail in there), I guess it suffices to say we have DPS who like competing with each other, Aussies with high ping, and very suicidal AOE.  In a way, it's bad, but I'll live with it if that's what it takes to keep people entertained enough to keep coming back week after week while waiting for more content.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">No.  No it is not like starting over.  In fact, it completely eliminates haste as a factor for LHW. <br>
<br>
Say you cast LHW every 3 seconds.<br>
<br>
Your heals then would land at <br>
<br>
1.5<br>
4.5<br>
7.5<br>
10.5<br>
<br>
With a 33% increase your heals would land at <br>
<br>
1.0<br>
4.0<br>
7.0<br>
10.0<br>
<br>
There is NO HPS gain at all from this.  None.  You are landing the same amount of healing in the same amount of time.<br>
The heal itself being faster in this case does nothing but perhaps increase your effective healing at the expense of jacking some other healer.  You decrease your overheal and increase theirs with no effective change in your HPS or improvement in the raids HPS.  <br>
<br>
You might look better, but you are robbing Peter to pay Paul.</div>

</div>I agree with your assessment of the impact of haste on LHW (which is zero). However, it brings up a broader concern I have about haste. My concern is that any time there's a "gap" in casting because you move or no one needs heal, it diminishes the returns on haste. The heal itself lands faster but you aren't able to cast more heals in a given period of time (or only a few more). I made this post a little while ago.<br>

				I did a scenario with 1800 +healing and no haste and 1700 + healing and 100 haste rating (6.34%). I assumed that it would take me 3.0 seconds to get off a chain heal, rather than 2.5 seconds. All the benefits of +healing and haste are based on the 2.5 second cast time. However, the HPS is based on the 3.0 cast time to create a more realistic scenario. So with 6.34% haste (and -100 +healing) my HPS rose 3.35% for Rank 5 chain heal and 2.95% for Rank 4.

<br>
Please note that I only modified the calculations on the Chain Heal tab. <br>
<br>
When I wear my haste gear during a raid, I just don't notice much difference in my healing done. Sure, I cast faster but my total healing done does not seem to increase as much as I would expect. Now, this is during a "normal" fight. There are a few that are very haste friendly because you literally are spam casting and never move and they don't last that long (i.e. Teron Gorefiend).</div>

		<div id="post_message_613988">I have a 2.23s CH or some such.  It will go even lower when I get the cloak off Illidan and HPS will go even higher when I get the 4th pc of t6.  Why stack haste? I have more than enough mana for every fight.  I can pot to increase mana should somthing go wrong. I suppose I could use haste pots but with mad alchemy and combat pots so cheap I find that between the 2 I am always with enough mana.  <br>
<br>
The faster your heal lands the better.  The other major benefit is being able to land more heals in the same amount of time means healing of more targets.  If you usually run with 6 healers simply having to heal a large number of people that means running with 5 healers with alot of haste could do the same job (assuming mana is not an issue).  The less healers the more DPS you have which makes the fighter shorter and easier on the mana.  THe HPS increase along with the reaction time decrease means I feel my effectiveness as a healer has increased a great deal after stacking haste.</div>

</div>Regarding the first paragraph - Yes, I agree.  The buff to mp5 lately has changed the playing field entirely.  That doesn't mean we should be less efficient.  It just means we should be trading mp5 for other stats.<br>
<br>
Regarding the paladin thing,  Anytime that someone starts a cast WELL after I've started mine is responsible for their own overheal.  That isn't my responsibility to cancel my heal because someone else has fired up a quicker heal.  Is it harder to react to chain heals because of the jump not appearing as an incoming heal? Yes.  But that would then result in some of that overheal that can't be removed from the game.  That differs entirely from me casting a 1.5 second heal on a target down 2k health when my mods are already showing incoming heals on that target, with the explicit hope of getting my heal in first.</div>

		<div id="post_message_614033">Haste to heal comparisons are tough even assuming something like a 2k heal shaman.<br>
<br>
If I compare an item that gives me 125 heal to an item that gives me 100 heal and 25 haste I have to look at the spells I cast that are benefited from heal or haste...they include:<br>
<br>
Chain Heal<br>
Healing Wave<br>
Lesser Healing Wave<br>
Earth Shield<br>
Searing/Magma/Nova Totems<br>
Spell Damage Spells<br>
Shocks<br>
<br>
For me, I'd eliminate the spell damage spells and shocks as I usually don't cast them often enough in a raid...e.g., I use flameshock to intentionally break sheep and then plead innocence by saying "shaman don't have dots."<br>
<br>
I'd look at how often I cast each of these spells and I'd come up with a healing equivalent calculation that would include:<br>
<br>
The percentage of time I cast each spell.<br>
The benefit of 25 haste over 25 healing for chain heal and healing wave.<br>
A penalty (in reduced heal) for healing wave<br>
A penalty for reducing the healing AND threat generated by earth shield.<br>
A penalty for reducing the dps of my searing and other applicable totems.<br>
<br>
To complicate matters, WWS doesn't attribute ES and totems to a specific shaman.<br>
<br>
If I'm comparing haste to crit, earth shield gets removed from the equation.<br>
<br>
Ideally you would like to replace mp/5 gear with haste.<br>
<br>
If you have 3 maces:<br>
Mace A has: +450 heal and +50 haste<br>
Mace B has: +450 heal and +10 mp5<br>
Mace C has: +500 heal<br>
<br>
If mana is not an issue, Mace A is always better than Mace B.<br>
If you are clearing trash in black temple, and spamming chain heal Mace A is arguably better than Mace C.<br>
If you are clearing trash in hyjal, and spamming chain heal while dropping fire nova totems, Mace C may be better than Mace A.<br>
If you are in a boss fight that is threat sensitive and you are earth shielding the MT, Mace C is most likely better than Mace A.<br>
<br>
Then you obviously have those situational boss fights where haste may be more important, especially if you are not ESing a target that benefits from additional threat.<br>

		<div id="post_message_614083">OK, so Grid definitely shows incoming heals. Can anyone who uses Healbot post with a definitive answer? Also, do you know exactly what sort of heals it fails to show as incoming? For example, is Prayer of Mending the main one it misses? <br>
<br>
Also, with Grid, will it show an incoming heal even if I'm not targeting that person (using Clique for example)?<br>
<br>
I currently use Xperl. It shows HoTs on the target (but not incoming heals). This alone has greatly helped our Druid healer, who screams much less now about us healing targets that he is already healing. I can only imagine what I could do if I knew who was about to get a heal. I'm hoping someone is going to post that something other than Grid also provides this utility. I just hate the way Grid looks (even though it's awesome in every other respect).</div>

Remember having 50% mana left at the end of the fight is far from having twice as much mana as you needed. If you have 12k mana, 50% is 6k. In the fight you probably used 30-50k mana or something of that magnitude, so having 50% mana left means you had 12-20% too much mana, not double. Of course you can do this more accurately to figure out exactly how much excessive mana you have and how likely you were to actually use it.</div>

		<div id="post_message_614191">Daidalos - That's kinda how I feel as well.  I run 2400 healing unbuffed.  Considering that mana isn't a issue, I can sacrifice around 100 healing and get around 150-200ish haste.  Now, the view is I am perhaps "stealing other people's heals", but look at it from the raid's perspective.  Coming from a guild who's overall DPS is probably considered "middle of the pack", it allows for us to perhaps drop 1 healer and grab an extra dps.<br>
<br>
Of course, for Illidan clearing guilds, is this improvement a necessity?  Probably not, but I would like to think that Sunwell will present itself healing challenges that will push all of us to be as efficient and responsive as we all can be.<br>
<br>
Otherwise, I can just sit there and spam chain heal rank 4 blindly and needlessly because I know my spriest will keep my mana bar pinned above 95%.  (And the only reason I would be there would be to mana-spring and mana-tide for the spriest who's keeping the mage's mana up)<br>
<br>
But going back to the haste question, I think to say that I started my heal before you, it's your own fault that you're overhealing is simplistic.  We don't all have the same computer, connection, ping, FPS etc.  If you are on the laggier end of the spectrum, stacking haste might not be a bad idea.  I would think that the total HPS of your healers should be a consistent sized pie, and we're just looking at improving people who's "slices" are too small and/or changing the number of "slices" (# of healers) completely.</div>

</div>Odd, it's the exact opposite for me.  When a priest casts PoH I will always get the 5 green buttons on the four party members + priest, but CoH is the one I never see (maybe since it's instant cast it doesn't register as "XX Priest begins to cast Circle of Healing on XX Raider"?)<br>
<br>
For the second question, there isn't a healer in my guild who doesn't use Clique, and Grid picks up incoming heals just fine.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">No.  No it is not like starting over.  In fact, it completely eliminates haste as a factor for LHW. <br>
<br>
Say you cast LHW every 3 seconds.<br>
<br>
Your heals then would land at <br>
<br>
1.5<br>
4.5<br>
7.5<br>
10.5<br>
<br>
With a 33% increase your heals would land at <br>
<br>
1.0<br>
4.0<br>
7.0<br>
10.0<br>
<br>
There is NO HPS gain at all from this.  None.  You are landing the same amount of healing in the same amount of time.<br>
The heal itself being faster in this case does nothing but perhaps increase your effective healing at the expense of jacking some other healer.  You decrease your overheal and increase theirs with no effective change in your HPS or improvement in the raids HPS.  <br>
<br>
You might look better, but you are robbing Peter to pay Paul.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>You are right if you cast one very 3 seconds but if you are spamming the heals the hps will be much higher. An easy test of this is use HealingWave 1 (a 1.0 second cast with 1.5 second GCD) and spam it for a set period of time. Then do the same with a LesserHealingWave 1 (a 1.5 second cast with 1.5 second GCD). This will simulate a 33% haste effect (1.5X33%= .5 seconds). <br>
<br>
In a 2 minute test I had 71 of the 1.0 second casts but only 60 of the 1.5 second cast. <br>
<br>
This simple test shows an approximate increase of 18% to HPS if you used haste with similar rank lessers. If a few more can test and verify my results please post what you came up with. In single target (raid spread out) healing fights with many taking damage can see haste as very viable but very mana intensive. <br>
<br>
Not saying Lesser are the way to go though. A HealingWave with haste will get a bonus as will the ChainHeals and using the most efficient heal will save mana if time allows.<br>
<br>
Edit: This test was faulty please read my second post below.</div>

</div>Yekkom, I don't understand what you are saying, because it doesn't make sense to me.  You are telling me that you cast more 1.0 speed spells in 2 minutes then 1.5 speed spells?  <br>
<br>
That doesn't make much sense because the GCD and spell casting is all handled client side so lag is not an issue.  In both cases the GCD would not free you to cast an additional spell any faster.  You should be getting 90 spell casts in 2 minutes.  Only landing 60 tells me that on average you are half a second behind the GCD during this test, so we aren't testing true spamming.  I think you just got luckier with the 1.0 second casts (And you still missed 19 possible casts in 2 minutes) but the mechanics of the game are such that 1.5 second spells finish exactly when the GCD comes up (At least since the spellcasting change that moved things client side).</div>

Between possible new skills, talents, set bonuses, raid mechanics and scaling this is just too many "What IF's".

I also would appreciate any suggestions on how to cast heals faster. I currently use Quartz to determine when to start casting the next spell. However, I still seem to be the slow poke in my guild. Spamming the key does seem to improve cast time but I'm not really a fan of constantly mashing buttons. It's fine for a particularly intensive phase of a fight but not something I want to do for 5 hours a night. <br>
<br>
Could frames per second be a factor? What if we are just not seeing the red portion of the Quartz bar fast enough or a drop in a players heath? I normally get about 15 frames per second but that drops to 5-6 during a raid. Latency is usually 300ms and that doesn't seem to be impacted by whether I'm in a raid or not.</div>

</div>An unfortunate factor of having low fps and high latency probably means quartz is 'very much behind'. <br>
Unfortunately, i don't think you have any other option to increase accuracy on recasts at those frame rates apart from 'mashing buttons'.<br>
I tend to get between 5-15 fps in raids and certainly at the lower end at times, using Grid/Clique combo, with Pitbull castingtimes on the player frame, i can start casting again when the pitbull timer is 3/4 full.<br>
<br>
Do you have too many addons? It was certainly a factor for me. Try going back to basics and rebuilding the addon folder and only include or switch on what you really need for raiding.</div>

		<div id="post_message_616198">If you get less than 12 FPS you're getting a clear and direct hit to your reaction time by the simple fact you get slower pictures on the screen than your brain can process. I'm not sure exactly how much FPS you need to effectively eliminate the slower reaction time effect of low FPS, but it's definitely somwhere &gt;12. Having 5 frames/sec means you lose up to 0.2s when it comes to seeing the info on time. Again this isn't completely scientific and can probably be better explained but it's enough to show you how low FPS definitely make you "the slow poke".</div>

</div>I do have quartz but for raid healing I find it more important to switch targets quickly.  I know others are using clique but I simply use mouse over healing macro and Pitbull.  While my current heal is going over I continuosly change who I am hovering on according to dmg they take and if other heals land.  I usually end up changing targets 2-3 times before my next heal is cast.  If you are doing this and still seem to be the slow poke I'd guess that then its a fps and latency issue.  I've always found that between nicely hasted chain heals and continuously chaning targets with mouseover as needed I'm usually one of the first to land a heal on the one who most needs it.</div>

</div>With quartz not being updated few resources out there for it now so muddled my way though the GUI. Found if I typed /quartz and then went into latency. Enabled embed and left the Embeded Safety Margin (ESM) of .6 I could use the bar better for faster casts. <br>
<br>
I hit next spell (ChainHeal or HealingWave) at 1.0 left and had more casts per minute. Hitting to soon gets "another action in progress" which messes up the next cast till you hit the button again.Turning (ESM) down got more "another action in progress" errors messages. Turning up wasted time casting. Guessing players need to adjust to how they heal.<br>
<br>
With Lesser Healing I had another trouble which was easier to fix. An error "spell not ready yet" came up when bloodlust was on. This is fixable by doing a macro<br>
<br>
/cast Lesser Healing Wave(Rank 7)<br>
/run UIErrorsFrame:Clear()<br>
<br>
Making spell totally spamable. This second line did not help higher cast time heals though which gave "another action in progress" error.<br>
<br>
<b>Shamanaut: You are completely right, there is no haste gains from casts faster than the GCD. My first numbers were operator error. Closed in on all heals to optimal numbers with above adjustments to my heals.<br>

		<div id="post_message_616259">Skyhoof, not that is a huge issue but i don't get why you say shaman should never use Auslese's Light Channeler?<br>
<br>
Given that its on use ability comes out to 5.5 Mp5 (it's really 5.97 but lets round down for arguments sake) assuming one cast a spell that costs at least 215 mana, which due to its on use nature one could take as a given. Using values from your gear guide we get a Healing Equivalent Points (HEP) of ~83.6.  <br>
<br>
Some of the starter trinkets listed above it like the Ancient Draenei Arcane Relic (~47.1 HEP), Xi'ri's Gift (~62.7HEP), and even Heavenly Inspiration(77.5 HEP) have much lower values. In fact the Oshu'gun Relic (88.5 HEP) is not much better. Granted that lower end shaman just starting Kara might value mp5 more and thus the Heavenly Inspiration could rank higher, but i don't see it being a bad trinket. <br>
<br>
Also given the fact that it could be picked up while leveling, or grinding the very necessary thrallmar rep, off a very easy boss I can't see why people should avoid it early in their healing careers. <br>
<br>
Anyone using 2*[Lower City Prayerbook] (well not a good idea in and of itself) would be foolish not switch out one for [Auslese's Light Channeler] and trading 7+heal for 5.5 mp5.<br>

</div>Yes, it does seem that you have tried to make that argument many times on this forum. I thought this was an especially good response:<br>
<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302211005/http://elitistjerks.com/586029-post427.html" target="_blank">http://elitistjerks.com/586029-post427.html</a><br>
<br>
This fight may be very different for a paladin than it is for a shaman. Melee takes fairly small but constant damage. You cast chain heal non-stop. This is quite a drain on the shaman’s resources (although made easier with the changes to WS/MS)<br>
<br>
Melee does a ton of DPS in this fight because ranged casters are running from orbs. You cannot afford to let them die. You don’t need a lot of +healing to be able to efficiently keep melee topped off. However, you do need quite a bit of mana. And you may not get a shadow priest in your group that night.<br>
<br>
If you “just stick to calculating how much healing you can do with the mana you have available” then you will be calculating at approximately what point in the fight your raid is going to run into trouble.<br>
<br>
There are many encounters where +healing is more important than your mana regen. Void Reaver is not one of them for shaman.</div>

		<div id="post_message_616530">If you can do more healing in 10 minutes with X +healing than with Y mana regen, X +healing is better even if Y regen increases you to infinite spamming ability. Bigger heals and more heals are simply interchangeable, especially when you can downrank but not nescessarily. Fact is healing 3k every 3s or healing 3.1k every 3.05s is nearly identical, even though the 3.1k every 3.05s setup would run you oom before the end of the fight if you spam it every 3s. Fact is the 3.1k every 3.05s setup simply did more healing throughout the fight and gets the job done better, even though it has less of an abilty to "spam without going oom" - which is a completely irrelevent ability.</div>

</div>Yes, the T5 helm is not my favorite piece of gear. If you are having issues with mana, you probably still want to wear the T4 helm. However, the T5 helm has 121 +healing when socketed, compared with 93 +healing in the T4 helm when socketed. The T5 also has some crit. So as mp5 and Intellect become less important, the Tier 5 actually starts looking a little better (it never gets THAT much better).<br>
<br>
If you have a lot of arena gear, you probably have more stamina than your average shaman but far less mp5. The +healing is probably comprable. Many of the new badge rewards are about the equivalent of Tier 5 gear (or better). <br>
<br>
On a seperate note...<br>
<br>
I have added stat weights for shaman at three stages of the game. I took the idea from Malan’s Enhancement post. I feel pretty confident about the Tier 4 and Tier 5 values. However, I'm still considering the weight I gave Haste in Tier 6. Appreciate your feedback and comments. <br>

Here’s the new information I added to the main post:<br>

To generate a list of gear using the rankings, I recommend <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302211005/http://www.lootrank.com/" target="_blank">Loot Rank</a>. Be sure to enter the meta gem value or it will use the Bracing Earthstorm. For more control over gear rankings (such as playing with different gems and set bonuses), I highly recommend <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302211005/http://hosted.filefront.com/Binkenstein" target="_blank">Binkenstein’s Shamstats</a>.<br>

</div>For me in t6 content and gear I am currently running about 2300 +healing and 130 mp5 unbuffed (no water shield no totem) and 120+ haste rating on trash on bosses I switch some haste for better stats (stam / regen) as needed.  For pure regen trinkets I use alchemist stone and eye of gruul or fathom brooch if needed.  So those are another ~70 mp5 equivlant for a loss of about 150 healing.   I think its good to be able to switch up gear a little as needed.  Regen isn't always better and pure +heal isn't always better.  Adapt to the strat and swap gear as needed.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Well they changed our regen enough that typical t4 and t5 would be different than I was at back then.  <br>
Here was my +healing for those levels though.<br>
For t4 content ~1300-1500 +healing.<br>

</div>I'll play with the mp5 some more. At the moment using the Tier 6 values above, <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30108"><span><span class="purplename">[Lightfathom Scepter]</span></span></a> ranks higher than <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33743"><span><span class="purplename">[Vengeful Gladiator's Salvation]</span></span></a>. If we drop the weight given to mp5 to 2.5, then the PVP mace ranks higher. You gain 21 +healing, +7 stamina and +3 Intellect at the cost of 11 mp5. Would that be a worthwhile sacrifice, in your opinion? I would consider myself a Tier 5 shaman so I don't have the first-hand experience that you do.</div>

</div>Ouch...that expains our differences in views.  <br>
<br>
I also think my most important stats are healing and haste.  With a spriest, I can freely spam rank 5's with around 160 unbuffed MP5, and I do just fine without a spriest spamming rank 4's.  I, unfortunately, also deal with warriors who thinks cleaves are rage-batteries.  </div>

</div>I would say you are ready for t5 content for sure with your gear, you have managed to find a good size of +healing from pure red gemming and badge/pvp/crafted gear. You have 129 mp5 in the armory right now which is fine for t5 as long as you have pots if the situation calls for it. 7.7k stam is also I think around average for a shaman doing t5 while your total mp at 8.8k is low, too low for my taste. I like to have over 10k without ancestral knowledge to give mana tide that umpfh.<br>
<br>
I had around 1900 healing when I started with t6 content but alot more mp5, int and stam then you currently have. If you could get your unbuffed stam up a bit along with your int then you will be fine for going straight into t6 also.<br>
<br>
Also I think you misunderstood the numbers a bit, the average t6 raiding resto shaman will probably have 2100-2200 healing, and one who just started will probably be just under 2k. Those who managed to get 2400 are the ones who farmed bt/hyjal for a while already and pretty much have the best possible piece on every slot.</div>

		<div id="post_message_616961">Max'ed out T6 numbers vary from 2300-2500 depending on how you enchant/gem your things.<br>
<br>
T5 tends to be under 2000.  The reason is that a lot of the stat allocated for T5 goes into +crit rather than +heal/mp5.  Furthermore, most guilds who can farm Kael/Vashj usually don't.  The T6 content offers much better gear and that's also part of the reason.  I'm sure a full T5-geared character with the Vashj mace will be around 2000 healing.<br>
<br>
Finally, your point about your 2000 healing with 0-T5 loot kinda shows how strong PVP and Badge loots are.  The badge loot are among the best non-T6 items in the game (In fact I use the boots), and the S2/S3 mace has more healing than the Vashj one.  It's definitely a valid upgrade unless you need the MP5.</div>

<br>
health: 8k <br>
mana: 11k<br>
healing: 1763<br>
mp5: 129<br>
crit: 9.82%<br>
<br>
And that's unbuffed. I use mana oils and mana regen flasks in t5 and with the water shield I get a high amount of mp5. I also got spellsurge on my Light's Justice (my mages love me almost as much as they love our shadow priest). Am I losing a lot of stats just to get that mp5? <br>
<br>
In my guild there are like 4-6 shamans rotating, 3-4 palas, 1 druid an 2 priests. I'm usually not the one healing the tank but assisting the MH and keeping the raid up (what's usual for a resto shaman).<br>

		<div id="post_message_617236">..actually, im not entirely clear on the sudden demotion of haste either. if you have a spell that gets hasted to a cast time of less than 1.5sec, the spell completes and fires off in.. less than the 1.5sec of the gcd. its just that you cant initiate another spell until the 1.5sec gcd has completed. or am i missing something?<br>
<br>
if the issue is landing a heal as soon as humanly possible to avoid your tank getting turned into street-pizza, then whats the problem here? yes, the SECOND spell you cast after that hail-mary and when youre able to cast it, thats a different story. still gotta wait on the gcd, but this was ever the case.<br>
<br>
but.. in what situation would haste not be good? my 70 is a dps so ive never seen the flipside of this til recently, but even with my midlevel shaman ive already had a couple 'oops' moments where a heal was a split second late and a dollar short. i precast whenever possible and cancel a heal or even downrank a heal as i see fit.. but once in a while you need to bring the 'Jesus-cast' and yet youre about 0.2sec too late.<br>
<br>
in other news, if theres something better than grid, im all ears. im concerned about certain incoming heals from particular spells not being shown, so alternatives are warranted. i always look around on files.wowace.com first, im a geek about material being up to date.</div>

</div>I second the shaman friend recommendation.  It also lets you know when earth shield runs out on the target which is quite nice since its something that may take me awhile to notice.  It also has other neat things for notify group/raid for purge, interrupt, mana tide and lust.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Hi, I've read a lot about resto shamans and leraner a lot with this post. I'm still trying to balance my gear. We are actually 40% in t5, downed void, solarian, hydross and lurker. Now heading for al'ar and morogrim. I'm full t4 and have t5 shoulders. I have the s3 chest and almost every piece of gear I can get from kara-mag-gruul (except for prince's cloak and maggy's shield). I have like four trinkets and I don't know when to use them (gruul's eye, martyr's whatever, pendant of the violet eye and opera's ribbon). I've been changing my gems to get more mp5 and I've lost a bit of healing, intelect and sta. With my current gear I'm at:<br>
<br>
health: 8k <br>
mana: 11k<br>
healing: 1763<br>
mp5: 129<br>
crit: 9.82%<br>
<br>
And that's unbuffed. I use mana oils and mana regen flasks in t5 and with the water shield I get a high amount of mp5. I also got spellsurge on my Light's Justice (my mages love me almost as much as they love our shadow priest). Am I losing a lot of stats just to get that mp5? <br>

In my guild there are like 4-6 shamans rotating, 3-4 palas, 1 druid an 2 priests. I'm usually not the one healing the tank but assisting the MH and keeping the raid up (what's usual for a resto shaman).<br>

</div>First, you have a lot of +Intellect. You have +12 Int on your bracers and used +8 int and +4 int/2mp5 on your legs. You have 11k mana unbuffed. That’s a huge amount – far more than needed. <br>
<br>
Suggestions:<br>
1) Regem your legs with straight +heal gems<br>
2) Put +30 healing or +6 mp5 on your bracers<br>
3) Always use Essence of the Martry. It’s the best trinket you have right now. <br>
4) Ditch the healing ring from Kara – <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=29290"><span><span class="purplename">[Violet Signet of the Grand Restorer]</span></span></a>. Trade it in for the Enhancement or Elemental version. I see shaman make this mistake all the time. That ring is of little value to shaman because of the spirit. You can buy a better ring from Thrallmar/Honor Hold – <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=29168"><span><span class="bluename">[Ancestral Band]</span></span></a> or <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=29169"><span><span class="bluename">[Ring of Convalescence]</span></span></a>. Or better yet buy a PVP ring or the <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=29373"><span><span class="purplename">[Band of Halos]</span></span></a> with heroic badges.<br>
<br>
And considering how much you love Intellect and a big mana pool, I’m a bit shocked that you are not specced 0-5-56. I don’t recommend that spec but it would seem a good fit for you. I would drop the 5 points in Totemic Focus and put them into Ancestral Knowledge.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">If you get less than 12 FPS you're getting a clear and direct hit to your reaction time by the simple fact you get slower pictures on the screen than your brain can process. I'm not sure exactly how much FPS you need to effectively eliminate the slower reaction time effect of low FPS, but it's definitely somwhere &gt;12. Having 5 frames/sec means you lose up to 0.2s when it comes to seeing the info on time. Again this isn't completely scientific and can probably be better explained but it's enough to show you how low FPS definitely make you "the slow poke".</div>

</div>I think you have probably hit upon my problem. I tried spam casting last night in BT and did see a noticeable improvement (at least on the healing meter compared with my twin shaman Khairis). It looks like if you have getting less than 10-12 FPS, spam casting is your best method (as much as a I hate pounding the mouse/keyboard). If you have better FPS, you can probably afford to either just cast the next heal shortly before the first finishes or use a mod such as Quartz. I think I'll add this to the main post somewhere. <br>
<br>
I have been meaning to take a look at my mods and try to streamline. However, we're raiding 6 nights a week now in an attempt to down Illidan before the Sunwell so there's been no time to play around with my UI. Eliminating Recount seems to help but I absolutely love that mod (especially the Grim Reaper function when someone says they have no idea how the tank died and it shows the tank went 6 seconds without heals). <br>
<br>
Are there any other mods that have a big impact on game performance? XPerl perhaps? If Grid is significantly more lightweight, it would be yet another argument in favor of switching.</div>

</div>Yes, I read the numbers based on current stats available. I'm wondering what the turning point would be where wearing T2 over future stats would be too great.<br>

		<td class="alt2" style="border:1px inset">
			
				What you lose (varies depending on current gear and which pieces of T2 you equip):<br>
• Healing -200 to -350<br>
• Crit -1% to -2%<br>
• Intellect -15 to -35<br>
• Stamina -25 to -80<br>
• Mp5 -20 to -50<br>
<br>
So the real effect of 3TS is around 14.3% more healing. In this example, you would need 2479 +heal to get the same effective heal without the 3T2 bonus so it’s worth about 729 +heal .
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>What numbers before the +% healing would = 0. When three pieces of gear = +729? Given current stats and projected level 80 stats, it'd have to be +243 healing per piece. This seems like an unreasonable amount of healing for a single piece of level 80 gear, just speculating. Based on that reasoning, would it be safe to say the T2 in it's current form could possibly be worthwhile at level 80?</div>

</div>Can you explain what the modified code does? Does this make the sound play 10 times instead of once? I'll also repost a modification that can be made to SCT.<br>
<br>
I'd like to share this little line of code that is inserted into 'interface\addons\sct\sct_event_config.lua'<br>
Inside the file there is a line local sct_Event_Config = { Next to that is a custom events list. I replaced 'lightning shield' event since it's usefulness is none to me. The file itself contains pretty clear explanations and examples for custom events so feel free to modify. It gives you warning when Water Shield fades. test.wav is your own to pick. <br>

</div>Yes, T2 could still possibly be worthwhile at Level 80. It scales well with +healing. I would also expect T6 to scale well into the next expansion. However, a lot may change. Just look at what happened to our class going from 60 to 70 with water shield and mana spring and shadow priests.<br>
<br>
We did BWL one Saturday afternoone when we were bored with about 15 people. It probably took a total of 3-4 hours if you include all the blood eleves we had to get attuned and people trying to find out where they put their Ony cloaks and the fact that you couldn't summon using the meeting stone. It was quite fun -- and profitable. The bosses dropped a decent amount of gold.</div>

</div>I was curious why you are using <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32216"><span><span class="purplename">[Royal Shadowsong Amethyst]</span></span></a> over <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32202"><span><span class="purplename">[Lustrous Empyrean Sapphire]</span></span></a> in blue sockets and the intial statement regarding using Ruby's and Spinels whenever possible? I'm not sure if this is the same for all resto shammys in BT/Hyjal, but I typically run 40% - 50% overhealing. This may be due to us having 3 - 4 resto shammys in each raid, but those numbers are pretty consistent.<br>
<br>
When I'm grouped with a Spriest, the +Healing is much better since mana is never a problem. But quite often I'm with Melee or Tanks, so my mana regen becomes the ceiling on healing intensive fights (e.g. Gurtogg). <br>
<br>
I'll lookup some of our full BT clears (trash isn't the best example), but I would be very interested in seeing how a significant +healing set does vs. +regen set (regarding enchants + gems).</div>

</div>Given a sufficiently high ilvl that the +healing on T2, the base healing from Chain Heal, and all non-scaling buffs/etc are trivial enough to ignore, all healing is coming from +healing on gear.  Boots + Bracers + Belt is 18% of your item budget.  As a result, you'll lose 18% of your +healing from gear (given perfectly distributed +healing accross your items slots -- not actually true, but good enough for this), and hence CH will be 18% smaller on the first target.<br>
<br>
Total Healing with normal gear: 100% + 50% + 25% = 175%<br>
Total Healing with 3pc T2: 82% + 53.3% + 34.645% = 169.945%<br>
<br>
At infinite +healing, 2pc T2 (barely) falls behind normal gear, indicating that it scales slightly worse than new items, and there is a break even point.  This point is easiest to find by looking at the final size of the heals.<br>
<br>
Let the average size of CH's initial heal at the break-even point in +healing gear be x.  Let the average size of CH's initial heal with 3pc T2 be y.<br>
<br>
x + x/2 + x/4 = y + y/2*1.3 + (y/2*1.3)/2*1.3<br>
1.75x = y + .65y + .4225y<br>
1.75x = 2.0725y<br>
y = .844x<br>
<br>
When wearing 3pc T2 results in the initial hit of CH to be 15.6% smaller, the total healing across all three bounces is the same.  Using the level 70 version of CH, we can calculate at what +healing this becomes true (assuming again the loss of 18% of +healing from 3pc T2 -- less true because enchants, gems and pots do not scale, but would still be relevant at these gear levels).  As far as I know, all multipliers apply after +healing, and so can be ignored.<br>
<br>
CH base is 884 healing.  The +healing coef is 2.5/3.5.  The break-even point is where reducing the amount of +healing by 18% results in a 15.6% smaller initial hit, i.e.:<br>
<br>
base + healing * .82 = .844 * (base + healing)<br>
884 + .82x = 746 + .844x<br>
138 = .024x<br>
x = 5750<br>
+healing = x / (2.5/3.5)<br>
+healing = 8050<br>
<br>
At level 70, 3pc T2 stops increasing the total amount healed by CH at +8050 healing.  Level 80 will make this number higher due to the larger base size of CH.  However, you will probably want to stop wearing it long before that, as items do have stats other than +healing, and by the time you're even thinking about 8050 healing, you'd be looking at losing potentially hundreds of points of int and stam and a large chunk of regen by wearing T2.</div>

From my PoV, +healing loses on average 40% due to overhealing while MP5 always scales. Granted chain heal is +125% +healing due to the 3 jumps, but if i have a +22 healing gem I really only end up gaining about +14 in healing on chain heal, and significantly less on LHW or HW. Only thing not accounted for here is the +Heal on ES.</div>

Granted chain heal is +125% +healing due to the 3 jumps, but if i have a +22 healing gem I really only end up gaining about +14 in healing on chain heal, and significantly less on LHW or HW. Only thing not accounted for here is the +Heal on ES.</div>

</div>Chain is is 125%? How did you arrive at that?  You not including talents?<br>
chain heal amount <br>
= [base amount + (2.5/3.5)*(plusHeal)]*(1.1)*(1.2) <br>
= base amount*1.1*1.2 +(plusHeal)*(2.5/3.5)*(1.1)*(1.2) <br>
= base *1.32 +(plusheal)(.942)<br>
<br>
So 94% on the initial heal then adding the other 2 jumps<br>
.942 + .4714 + .2357 = 1.649 or about 165% of plus healing.  <br>
<br>
I have no idea how you got 14 healing from a +22 gem.<br>
<br>
Also HW with 3 stacks of healing way yeilds 3/3.5 *1.1 *1.18 = 111% increase from +heal. ES gets .3 of +healing per charge for a total of 3.00 or 300% +healing.<br>
<br>
As stated above the gains from +healing won't translate into overheal if you down rank.  Stacking healing gives you the option of conservaing mana via downranking or high HPS via top rank spamming. Mp5 gives you no choices.</div>

</div>In how many of these fights did you run out of Mana?<br>
<br>
Looking at the nearly 6 minute gorefiend with you in the Melee group, you apparently only used 1 Mana pot.  I can't think you are running out of Mana, on what is arguably the most mana draining of our fights when you are only using 1 Mana pot.<br>
<br>
Your math is right about all of the other things, but you fail to take into account that if you are not running out of mana, mp5 is useless.  Your raid also seems to have low DPS, which would increase your mp5 needs.  All of our kills are twice as fast as yours, which will reduce my desire for mp5 compared to yours.  I do think as a guild, you need to look at some of the other reports out there and figure out where you are failing in DPS.  Gorefiend should never be a 5 minute fight.  It looks like you are running BT with 10 healers, which seems to be a lot for me. I think if you can increase DPS of your raids by 10-15%  (And hence drop kill times by 10-15%) you'll find you will really be preferring +healing over mp5.  <br>
<br>
In your situation though, with such long kills, I can absolutely understand why you are placing a higher value on mp5.<br>
<br>
MP5 also doesn't always scale.  If you are standing around and can not get off of max mana no matter what you cast, mp5 is no longer scaling (Except maybe on Kazrogal).</div>

</div>Only phase 2 of Illidan is chain friendly.  I dont' think you will be able to get much out of that.  I'd post but I hardly ever down rank just due to not needing mana.  Down ranking not only results in more efficient spells in heal/mana but also reduces overheal.  For exmaple spamming chain heals down ranking from CH5 to CH4 saves 200 mp5 for a 300 healing difference on the first target per cast.  On healing wave down ranking from HW12 to HW10 saves 200 mp5 at a loss of ~800 healing per cast.  <br>
<br>
Having 40% over heal is extremely high and I would only expect this if you have more than enough mana (This happens to me alot).  If most of your healers have 40% over heal you can most likely replace a healer with dps and just kill the mob faster. If you are worried about mana and blindly spam your top tank heal with no regard to efficiency then sure plus healing isn't beneficial, but who does that?</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">What you're saying may be true, but I have yet to see a WWS of this being done. I've looked at other guilds WWS reports to see what rank CH the resto shammys where using, and nobody was down ranking (at least they looked on par with CH5).</div>

</div>/agree with Daidalos above<br>
<br>
You probably have seen it many times in WWS reports and just didn't know what you were seeing was downranking. You would need to armory each of the healers in the WWS (and hope the logged out in their raid gear) and then calculate what their average CH4 and CH5 would be with raid buffs. <br>
<br>
Also, it's not as though most shaman spam only CH4 for the entire fight. There might be periods where they switched to CH5 and then went back to CH4. This would make it difficult to tell from a WWS report, unless you could ask the shaman directly what spell they used. <br>
<br>
Just a reminder from the main post:<br>

</div>I'm not sure if I am a good example. I am usually paired with a spriest and just spam Ch4 alot.  If you are worried about mana conservation my being in a spirest and spamming heals isn't the best example, but Ch5 has been a "only use in emergency* button for me since I first did the heal/mana comparisons in starting 25 mans.  Only 2 pc t6 changed that for me since ch4 scales at the same rate as ch5 as Skyhoof reiterated.<br>

		<div id="post_message_618002">Additionally, I think MP5 is largely overblown as a stat.  If I remember correctly, I had around 150-160 MP5 (unbuffed no MT, no WS) pretty easily in T4 gear.  As it stands, I'm in T6 and still have 160 mp5 (not counting Memento).<br>
<br>
Assuming I swap out some gear to toss in stuff like tome of diabolic remedy and re-enchant my items, I would probably make out with around 35 more MP5 tops.  That's all of 2100 mana or around 5 CH-rank4s more I can toss out in a 5 minute fight.  Personally, if you feel that 5 more CH's is necessary for a particular fight, there's probably more going on that needs to be fixed with your raid than your personal healing.<br>
<br>
It's not to say you should ignore MP5, but a large majority of the gear we get come with enough MP5 as it is.  Barring wearing PVP gear, if you wear mail-healing gear, you should have approximately "enough" MP5 to succeed in most fights.  For those who need the "extra" amount, you can always pop full consumables and change your trinkets.</div>

I don't gem exclusively for +heal or + mp5, I usually take the socket bonus. I gem like it was posted in the first post (i think, to lazy to check): 11/2mp5, 22 heal, 11/5 Int depending on the color.<br>
<br>
I have a moderate amount of haste (the 2 random rings and the ZA weapon at all times. For EoS I wear my complete haste gear (which adds the neck, shoulders from ZA and a belt from BT).<br>
<br>
Most of my healing is CH 1 or 4 - I only use CH 5 when full healing power is needed, because I think that an additional 300 healing on the main target (proportionally less on the jumps) is usually not worth the 100 mana.<br>
<br>
To put it differently (I'm just using the numbers from DrDamage, so they might be slightly wrong): I pay 370 Mana (with 2 piece Tier 6) to get 3200 healing on my target (~6400 on all jumps) with CH 4. That would be 8.6 HPM for my target, 17.3 HPM on all targets.<br>
<br>
With CH 5 I pay 460 Mana to get 3500 on my target (~7000 on all jumps). That would be 7.6 HPM on my target, 15.2 HPM on all jumps.<br>
<br>
Doesn't sound like a huge difference? So let me put it differently.<br>
<br>
With CH 5 I pay an additional 90 Mana to get an additional 300 healing on my target (600 on all jumps). That would be 3.3 HPM on my target, 6.6 HPM on all jumps.<br>
<br>
That is a huge difference.</div>

Sometimes while healing intensively, when I’m in most need of Water Shield I forget to rebuff it. I use totemtimers and this addon has a reminder, but it doesn’t help. I switched from SCT to Mik’s scrolling combat text for the same reason, but it didn’t help too. Does anyone know any addon with distinctive visual effect and sound, which can help me.<br>

I'll still use TotemTimers for the extra WS icon, but PA makes it so much easier to keep track of.</div>

The -20 mana reduction comes off the base spell cost. When you have the Tidal Focus and the first T6 set bonus, the actual mana reduction is below. <br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">In how many of these fights did you run out of Mana?<br>
<br>
Looking at the nearly 6 minute gorefiend with you in the Melee group, you apparently only used 1 Mana pot.  I can't think you are running out of Mana, on what is arguably the most mana draining of our fights when you are only using 1 Mana pot.<br>
<br>
Your math is right about all of the other things, but you fail to take into account that if you are not running out of mana, mp5 is useless.  Your raid also seems to have low DPS, which would increase your mp5 needs.  All of our kills are twice as fast as yours, which will reduce my desire for mp5 compared to yours.  I do think as a guild, you need to look at some of the other reports out there and figure out where you are failing in DPS.  Gorefiend should never be a 5 minute fight.  It looks like you are running BT with 10 healers, which seems to be a lot for me. I think if you can increase DPS of your raids by 10-15%  (And hence drop kill times by 10-15%) you'll find you will really be preferring +healing over mp5.  <br>
<br>
In your situation though, with such long kills, I can absolutely understand why you are placing a higher value on mp5.<br>
<br>
MP5 also doesn't always scale.  If you are standing around and can not get off of max mana no matter what you cast, mp5 is no longer scaling (Except maybe on Kazrogal).</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>You might be right that when you check those WWS stats MP5 might be useless, but take consideration that he also heals less than shaman would be able to heal. If he would heal at max potential then MP5 would be some value.<br>
<br>
I wont go oom on teron or gurtog not even close when sp group, but I do have twice more healing done and HPS, effective over 1600HPS gurtog each time while random healing. Our CoH priest do does even more than that, but they are spamming it whole fight.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I think you have probably hit upon my problem. I tried spam casting last night in BT and did see a noticeable improvement (at least on the healing meter compared with my twin shaman Khairis). It looks like if you have getting less than 10-12 FPS, spam casting is your best method (as much as a I hate pounding the mouse/keyboard). If you have better FPS, you can probably afford to either just cast the next heal shortly before the first finishes or use a mod such as Quartz. I think I'll add this to the main post somewhere. <br>
<br>
I have been meaning to take a look at my mods and try to streamline. However, we're raiding 6 nights a week now in an attempt to down Illidan before the Sunwell so there's been no time to play around with my UI. Eliminating Recount seems to help but I absolutely love that mod (especially the Grim Reaper function when someone says they have no idea how the tank died and it shows the tank went 6 seconds without heals). <br>
<br>
Are there any other mods that have a big impact on game performance? XPerl perhaps? If Grid is significantly more lightweight, it would be yet another argument in favor of switching.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>I switched to Pitbull from X-Perl and have noticed an improvement. I ONLY use Pitbull for Player, Target, ToT and ToTT frames and use Grid for raid/party. Not sure if that specifically improves performance but i certainly saves screen space and less things on screen will increase fps.<br>
<br>
Anything that does any kind of ingame processing will reduce FPS if your gpu and cpu can't handle it. So things like Recount or DamageMeters, mods like Prat or SimpleCombatText or anything that does any sort of adding and storing of data. It's more a culmination of mods perhaps rather than one mod that has a huge impact (apart from perhaps Recount)</div>

</div>Time is usually a factor and as well healing way isn't guaranteed to be up all the time unless you're assigned to a tank. But yeah, raid healing where chain heal isn't going to hit more than one target LHW is what I use. And when just the tank is taking damage and everyone else is spamming him as well I usually just spam chain heal (rank 1). If I'm the only one assigned to a given tank however, that's when HW is my primary heal.</div>

</div>Most of the time you shoudn't be using lesser helaing wave all that much but it will depend greatly on the fight.  Typicallly I have 90% chain heals 9% healing wave and 1% LHW.  This can drasticaly change though.  For example on Archimonde when running around to make sure people are topped off it switched to 50% healing wave (on the MT when not running around) 40% LHW and 10% chain heal.  Now if a Shaman went through the entire instance with 60% LHW I'd talk to him, but having a fast heal land at the cost of mana is a good trade on many fights especially Archimonde, Najentus during his bubble, and situationally on other fights as well.</div>

Typicallly I have 90% chain heals 9% healing wave and 1% LHW.  This can drasticaly change though.  For example on Archimonde when running around to make sure people are topped off it switched to 50% healing wave (on the MT when not running around) 40% LHW and 10% chain heal.  Now if a Shaman went through the entire instance with 60% LHW I'd talk to him, but having a fast heal land at the cost of mana is a good trade on many fights especially Archimonde, Najentus during his bubble, and situationally on other fights as well.</div>

</div>The stupid robots between Shahraz and Council.  Keeping 25 people topped off on this trash is about 90% of my LHW in the T6 instances.  It's the worst trash in the game since the Twin Emps -&gt; C'thun stuff.<br>
<br>
My other uses (Besides those listed by Daid) are on Bloodboil (Probably about 10-15% of my casts there) and Illidan (Flame DOT + Flame Burst which is about 5% of casts).  On the rest of the instance, LHW is less then 2% of my total casts.</div>

		<div id="post_message_620932">Another +heal spammer here, although my perspective is a little different than several of yours, because my guild does amazing damage. Our Gorefiends range from 2.5-3 minutes and we have the #3 kill on Rage Winterchill, and we've only downed Illidan twice now. With that being said, I raid with 127mp5 unbuffed (my armory may not show it as being quite that low, because I don't usually log off in my 3pc T2, which I use almost every fight), and I don't need any more than that either for the majority of the fights in Black Temple/MH. I'll still socket for bonuses that net only a small loss in healing, but other than that, I gem entirely for +heal. <br>
<br>
On Illidan, in which I've had to be on tank healing duty during both of our kills, resulting in me hardly chain healing that fight (except after the first Flame of Azzinoth dies and a few other choice times), I use an Alchemist's Stone and Talasite Owl instead of my usual trinkets.<br>
<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080207152803/http://wowwebstats.com/gaxyn54anu2n1?s=12327-13621" target="_blank">WWS Loading...</a><br>
<br>
That was our first Illidan kill, in which I was blessed with a Shadow Priest (a rarity for me, before I was Imp GoA specced, I was normally in the melee or tanks group, now I'm typically placed with our 3 hunters and a Feral Druid), but for our second kill, I did without one (logs aren't up for kill 2).<br>
<br>
The only other times I struggle for mana are if my mana cooldowns are down and I've died, or in extreme cases (last weeks Council, in which we had 7 healers, 2 paladins and 5 shamans). I use Chain Heals 1, 2, 4, 5 and max rank Healing Wave and Lesser Healing Wave only (aside from rank 1 HWs in random situations, eg out of mana on RoS and applying Healing Way on a full health target).<br>
<br>
I don't conserve mana a whole lot, I prefer to heal big and often, and I still find that as long as I keep Water Shield up, then pop Mana Tide ASAP, and spam pots/drums (use restoration only on a few fights, battle the rest of the time) every 2 minutes, I have plenty of mana. I have geared/gemmed this way since the middle of our SSC/TK progression, even before Water Shield was buffed at all, so I honestly believe the necessary mp5 for a shaman isn't that much. Shamans downed Illidan pre water shield buff with similar mp5 to what I have with the buff, so I don't see where the problem is with regen.</div>

</div>Not all that different, if you look you will notice who has #1 on many on those fights ;-).  <br>
<br>
Certainly the longer the fight the more value mp5 has the real question I think is can you deal with long fights without the mp5 and downrank instead.  Personally I swap from +healing trinkets to regen ones (alchemist, eye of gruul or fathom brooch).  I think I'd rather have all plus healing on my gear and swap in regen trinkets as needed then gem / gear for mp5 and down rank as needed.   Again this is situational though.  If a fight has very short bursts of high dmg followed by low amount of dmg (e.g. Illidan) you gain the least from down ranking as opposed to medium constant dmg where you can spam a lower rank saving a large amount of mana.  <br>
<br>
If you think 7 healers is an extreme case on council we run with 5 sometimes :-p.  Now that is stressfull.</div>

</div>Nope.  Feel free to test for yourself.  Its covered many places on this forum notably here: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080207152803/http://elitistjerks.com/f31/t18865-working_theories_theorycrafting_2_3_a/" target="_blank">Working Theories of Theorycrafting as of 2.3</a><br>
<br>
LHW would be 1.15s chain casting with lust. Your log doesn't prove anything btw.  You have to chain cast.  Since GCD starts at the beginning of the cast not when the LHW completes you cannot just post 2 consecutive LHW to show anything.</div>

</div>Sorry, I wasn't referring to you, but yeah, I bet 5 healer council is pretty fun. I was mostly stressing that our healer balance has sucked recently, having no resto druids or holy priests most of the time, moreso than the actual number of healers.<br>
<br>
Anyways, that's pretty much what I do. Gem for healing, and have trinkets/relics nearby just in case. I've always made the habit of wearing my regen items on progression fights, because I like that extra padding if there's something I haven't accounted for.</div>

		<div id="post_message_621818">While for me it's too late, roll leahterworking! As a shaman you'll find yourself in dps groups a lot, giving them 80 haste rating for 25% of the time is quite more worthwhile than ring enchnats. And as a shaman LW might actually be useful someday if blizzard decides to give it some resto shaman love, but that's just a side thing  main reason is drums are simply better than ring enchants in terms of helping your raid, the way I see it average 20 haste rating for 4 people (let's assume non-consistent haste rating is useless to you even though that's not completely true) is more worthwhile than 40 healing IMO.</div>

</div>Yes, recently. In addition to enchanting I ended up doing leatherworking at the same time. Those two profs I would recommend to new shaman. 1) Ring enchants are OP 2) shaman are 90% of the time in DPS groups so increasing your contribution to the group with drums is ++. If you're trying to level these two profs in a short amount of time then you will need a decent amount of gold to burn. Very worth it though, IMO.<br>
<br>
Before I picked up enchanting/leatherworking I was a JC and miner. While those are nice for making gold and the JC-only gems in the end it came down to what's best for the raid.<br>
<br>
edit: Just want to add, leatherworking turned out to be a nice money maker so that was a nice surprise.</div>

</div>I think it was 2-2.5k for enchanting, 1-1.5k for leatherworking. Granted that's a lot of gold but from the stand point of Sunwell progression it's better than sitting on 15k gold w/o raid-geared profs when 2.4 comes out. A small price to pay for the smiting of ones enemies (who knows where that quote is from :P)<br>
<br>
As a side note, I probably spent more than was necessary because I put speed over thrift when obtaining mats. A smarter person than me could have done it for less.</div>

</div>While enchanting and leatherworking are both good professions however I think a recently leveled shaman would be better off keeping alchemy and having either ench / LW as the second profession.  Alchemist stone is the best regen trinket (chain potting) in the game for a shaman in addition to having nice stats.  Fel mana and dreamless sleep pots with alchemist stone equipped have saved the day for me on numerous occasions.  Oh btw last I checked fel mana didn't decrease +healing (regardless of that the tooltip says)  I can get away with combat pots usually if I need to pot at all with everything on farm.</div>

<br>
I don't believe that second statement is correct if you have a spell (such as LHW) with a 1.5 second cast time.<br>
<br>
This could be an amazing change for shamans if it reduces the global cooldown on all spells as well as the actual cast time. For example, with 10% haste the cast time of HW or CH becomes 2.275 seconds. Now what if the GCD were also reduced a similar amount so it dropped to 1.36 seconds? <br>
<br>
Theorycrafters: Start Your Spreadsheets!<br>
<br>
EDIT: I wonder if spell haste would now apply to dropping totems!?!</div>

		<div id="post_message_622727">In case this hasn't been covered earlier, my testing indicates that Totem of the Thunderhead only gives you the extra 27 mana while you have it equipped (as opposed to if you had it equipped when you cast water shield.)<br>
<br>
If I do the following:<br>
 - start with totem of whatever equipped<br>
 - macro /cast Water Shield /equip Totem of the Thunderhead<br>
 - switch to another Totem<br>
 - get damaged and have a Water Shield proc<br>
<br>
Then I get back the usual 203-204 mana instead of 230-231.<br>
Conclusion: The extra 27 mana only works when you have the totem equipped.<br>
I suspect it is probably the same for the extra 2 mp5<br>
<br>
So, is it worth using a /cast /equip macro for Totem of the Thunderhead?<br>
I think yes, because there will be some cases where you get extra mana from it, before casting your next heal (with its own corresponding macro). For example:<br>
 - on Archimonde you cast Water Shield, then get feared/have to run away from a fire before your next heal, or<br>
 - on Illidari Council, you cast Water Shield, then a blizzard is cast on top of you and you need to move, getting the extra mana in the process.<br>
It's not a lot of extra mana, but the only trade-off is a bag slot.</div>

</div>I think this is not a correct method to verify weather Totem of the Thunderhead is useful only while casting for Water Shield. Problem is you first cast Water Shield, then equip the totem, so the cast does not profit form the totem. The normal /cast .. /equip Totem .. macros works so that you begin to cast the spell, switches totem and when you successfull casts the spell your actual healing with the equipped totem is used. It could work when you first equip Totem of the Thunderhead before casting Water Shield, but equipping triggers the GCD so you must wait to cast Water Shield, so it may not so profitable in raids. I cant test weather the Water Shield would be still improved after switching totems if starting with Totem of the Thunderhead, but i think it could be easily tested through the mp5-display in your char-profile.</div>

		<div id="post_message_623236">Very Nice Guide first off.<br>
<br>
I havnt read all the replys to this thread yet but id like to comment on the meta gem debate. Ive used both the IED and MSD and i must say that the MSD is superior, in my opinion. It procs alot, it almost feels as if there is no 45 second internal cooldown =p. And when i get it, theres been alot of situations where i got it at the right time. <br>
<br>
I have a question however. Im currently a shaman in a t6 guild, and we've recently downed illidan (twice this thursday), and I always get a headache trying to determine witch sockets i should use.<br>
<br>
Example: <br>
Leggings of Eternity<br>
3 Blue Sockets<br>
9+ Healing Socket Bonus<br>
<br>
Should I go with 3 Royal Shadowsong Amethysts? (Which give me, counting the socket bonus, 42+ Healing and 6Mp5)<br>
or 3 Teardrop Crimson Spinels (Which give me 66+ Healing)<br>
Things like that.<br>
<br>
Also, my stats are<br>
2090 Healing<br>
193 Mp5 while casting (This is with watershield)<br>
<br>
With totems its<br>
2191 Healing<br>
255 Mp5</div>

</div>You really can't go wrong either way. Both 3x Royal Shadowsong Amethysts and 3x Teardrop Crimson Spinels are good choices, but if your guild is anything like mine, there is usually a wait-list to get Crimson Spinels that is constantly hovering at around 2 weeks long. For this reason it may be a better idea to give those red gems to DPS classes first, as they see a much more reliable benefit from maxing their DPS versus maxing our +heal.</div>

Both 3x Royal Shadowsong Amethysts and 3x Teardrop Crimson Spinels are good choices, but if your guild is anything like mine, there is usually a wait-list to get Crimson Spinels that is constantly hovering at around 2 weeks long. For this reason it may be a better idea to give those red gems to DPS classes first, as they see a much more reliable benefit from maxing their DPS versus maxing our +heal.</div>

</div>Hmm, its actually 2 blue sockets and 1 yellow socket in the hyjal pants. So its 4 mp5, +5 int and 42+ healing VS +66. I think its honestly personal choice but I would probably go with spinels IF your guild has a decent supply, most likely theirs a wait list so I would just go with the socket bonus.</div>

</div>115 MP/5 should be fine, if you add Water Shield, 25 MP/5 Flask, Brilliant Mana Oil and your mana totem. <br>
I suggest also <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30663"><span><span class="purplename">[Fathom-Brooch of the Tidewalker]</span></span></a> as one of your trinkets. This trinket alone provide around 27-32 MP/5 from CH "spam".<br>
<br>
I prefer CH2 as staple heal and CH4 as second choice. CH2 spam with occasional CH4/CH5 powered by 12% permanent spellhaste works very well.</div>

</div>It depends on having or not having a SP. My advice is quite simple: start off with your normal healing equipment for boss fights. If you have mana problems, then keep using that equipment. If you always have lots of mana left at the end of the boss fight, start wearing some more haste equipment.<br>
<br>
Always wear haste equipment on trash, as  you can (usually) drink after every mob group if you have no more mana.</div>

With an easily obtainable 150 mp5 from gear we get a grand total of 463 mp5 which, to put in perspective, is going to recover more than half of a rank 5 chain heal during the time in which it is cast. (again I'm leaving mana tide out and of course there are further regen options like shadow priests for mana intense fights)<br>

Suffice it to say that stacking mp5 on gear should not be a top priority on a wish list going into sunwell.</div>

I have some questions about totems and agro, as my guild  now and then complains about it.<br>
Last night on Kaz'rogal after wave 8 and Kaz'rogal was on incoming I dropped wrath of air totem to buff the maintank with Eartshield. Then the raid complained about totems taking agro. After raid I found out it was the mana tide totem which should have pulled the agro. All in all a bit confusing, I do not think I had mana tide up, but our other shaman did. But in order to avoid this from happening again I want to know exactly how totems agro work.<br>
<br>
Do they draw agro to themselves when cast or to the owner.<br>
Does Mana tide/healing stream totem give agro to itself or the caster when regenerating.<br>
Or do they only pull agro by a body pull.</div>

</div>Totems can draw aggro, but there must be several conditions ...<br>
<br>
* The Mob has only "passive" aggro -&gt; Body Pull or Puller is dead<br>
* You cast a new totem and the totem buff someone<br>
* Someone enter the totemrange and receive the totem buff<br>
* Healing Stream heal someone<br>
<br>
I consider the following conditions as "safe" ...<br>
<br>
* You cast the totems before you enter combat<br>
<b>* No-one enter the totemrange</b> until the mob has "direct" aggro (from damage or heal)<br>
* You can recast totems as long as all group members have the totem buff already "active"<br>
* I never had any problems with Mana Spring as long as all "safe" conditions are true.<br>
<br>
But I avoid Healing Stream and Mana Tide before the tank has direct aggro.</div>

Buffing, restoring mana and healing all generate threat in addition to dealing damage. This is small threat, however, and if a totem pulled aggro it means the mob wasn't picked up.

		<div id="post_message_627235">Totems buff which produces a small amount of threat as others have noted.  As does returning mana or health (which is why spirest aggro is so high even though they do alot less dmg than many other classes).<br>
<br>
Also keep in mind that some totem buffs are not static they pulse.  They de/buff at 2 or 5s increments<br>
Totems that pulse:<br>
Tremor<br>
Windfury<br>
Poison / Disease cleasnsing<br>
water spring<br>
healing stream.<br>
stoneclaw<br>
<br>
ALso any totems doing dmg produce threat as does the countdown pulses of fire nova totem (its an odd mechanic since it it doing any dmg yet still produces threat.  Seems like a stoneclaw effect.)<br>
<br>
I don't think decursing produces any threat however I am not completely sure.  Tremor, poison cleanse, and disease cleanse fall under the decursing types and I don't think they generate aggro.  Someone correct me if I am wrong on this.<br>
<br>
The other buffing totems that pulse will generate everytime they pulse and reapply thier respective buff.  Windfury is the most common totem to get aggro.  Many fights where bosses or mobs randomly target people windfury would get targeted e.g. shade of aran, teron, etc (this mostly seems to be fixed but the point is how they produce threat not that mobs randomly target them)..    Before fear mechanic change when aggro would be lost during fear, when the entire raid would be feared pulsing totems would frequently get aggro.  I think onyixia destroyed my WF totem every week pre TBC raiding when the raid was feared.</div>

</div>This is not true uptime though.<br>
Consider two extremes you have 25 crit heals out of 150 heals with a heal landing every 2.5 secs.<br>
<br>
Your AF uptime if the 25 crits happen in a row would be 24*2.5+15=75secs<br>
If you crit every 6th heal you would have 25*15=375secs<br>
<br>
edit: Just to be clear your math is right but it does not = uptime <br>
it does = % chance you will refresh AF before it expires</div>

Buffing, restoring mana and healing all generate threat in addition to dealing damage. This is small threat, however, and if a totem pulled aggro it means the mob wasn't picked up.

We used this for Leotheras. Always make sure to have a Searing totem up and he will return to the tank spot after every whirlwind to kill the totem. Makes the fight a lot easier.</div>

</div>I think it counts for all totems, but the amount of threat buff totems generate is less than a HoT, DoT or something else ticking.<br>
<br>
<br>
We also initially thought it was a timing issue, but that wouldn't explain Hydross phase change to "water", Hydross targetting the Searing Totem, <b>then</b> a Shield Slam + Heroic Strike hits and still the totem has aggro.</div>

		<div id="post_message_629836">Just wanted to say great work on the guide. It has helped me become a better healer and has taught me a lot about how to gear myself more effectively.<br>
<br>
I was reading some posts a few pages back regarding mods that track incoming heals and while Grid does indicate someone is healing a specific target with a little green box, the RDX (Raid Data Exchange) mod can show you who is healing the target, what spell/rank they are using, how much the spell will heal for (approx.) and even when they casted their heal/when the heal is going to land.<br>
<br>
For these features to be effective, all of the healers need to be using the mod, just like grid, but being able to see when someone else's heal is going to land in relation to yours can really cut your OH by a significant amount. The mod by itself still provides a powerful raid healing frame supporting single click heals. Also, you can see if enough heals are being juggled on your MT at times when you know they are going to take a lot of spike damage because the mod shows the expected value of all those heals that are being cast on him.</div>

<br>
 I have dealt with this pnenomenon before, especially on Hydross.  I now recall my totems a couple seconds before transition just to make sure.  I have the same assumption as you about the head start theory as it also seems to gain some credence from the Leotheras encounter.  There have been other circumstances where my searing totem has pulled aggro but never when the mob is being directly tanked.  It is kind of like the mechanism with dot's.  It's just imperative that you recall your Searing Totem before the threat wipe as aggro is very touchy for those few short seconds.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Last night I picked up my second piece of T5 and was wondering where I should stat wise for T5 content.  Currently My guild is working on Phase II of Vaj.  With 3/4 TK &amp; 5/6 SSC complete.  After I gemed and enchanted my new Leggins I am sitting at 1995 Healing and 143 Mp5.  Do I need all this healing?  Should I regem for More Mp5? Am I fine where I am at?</div>

</div>I see this question a lot. Although there is never an easy answer, I came up with some ranges.<br>
<br>
All values are unbuffed. Arcane Intellect (+41 Int), Mark of the Wild (+41 Int) and Blessings of Kings (+110% Intellect) can easily increase your mana pool by 2000. <br>
<br>
In your particular case, you are at the low end of mp5. However, Skyhoof runs around BT and Hyjal with 150 mp5 while casting. And I don't bother to flask for most fights (or even use a mana pot). However, I'm a firm believer that +healing gives you more flexibility than mp5. <br>
<br>
Pre-Kara <br>
Health 5000-6000<br>
Mana: 7000-8000<br>
Mp5 while casting: 115-145<br>
Healing: 1200-1500<br>
 <br>
Tier 4 <br>
Health: 7000-7800<br>
Mana: 8500-9600<br>
Mp5 while casting:  125-150<br>
Healing: 1750-2000<br>
 <br>
Tier 5 <br>
Health: 7500-8200<br>
Mana: 9000-10,000<br>
Mp5: 150-200<br>
Healing: 1900-2100<br>
 <br>
Tier 6 <br>
Health: 8500-8700<br>
Mana: 9500-10,500<br>
Mp5: 150-300<br>
Healing: 2000-2300<br>

Just read this guide earlier, and it still contains stuff I do differently, or just generally, interesting facts (in healing business with my shaman since 2 months of raiding, got Hyjal attuned last night).<br>
<br>
For gear upgrades I always used Skyhoof's guide (official forums) but I figured I'll take a look at Binkenstein's excel file (although excessive theorycrafting makes my brain overflow at times) <br>

This might not be the right place to ask the question but still, there's something I couldn't figure out so far. FAQ states, as first step, "1) Select for HEP/DEP (Stats)" and I just don't see any drop-down or anything for that.  have selected my gear and spec, sorted stuff by HEP but at upgrade page I'm still getting DEP upgrades for my slots. Now I'm probably blind or stupid or both, but really, after spending 20 minutes looking at the first page of the excel I gave up. Anyone feeling generous to give me a hint, please?  Thanks.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>LHW will hit 1s at 790 haste rating without h/bl. However, from the current gear selections (not including non-mail) a maximum with the scarab proc is 692 haste rating<br>
This gives:<br>

</div>The "Upgrades" tab is a static page on which you manually select your upgrades. It won't automatically update. I believe Binkenstein intended it as a quick reference guide so you could see all your upgrades at a glance. So if the other pages are sorting by HEP (Helm, neck, etc) then you are using the spreadsheet correctly.<br>

<br>
Which four pieces of Tier 6 do you plan on wearing once eight pieces become available? The bracers, boots and belt seem to be the strongest pieces, along with either the helm or shoulders. There are much better non-set pieces of legs, chest and gloves. <br>
<br>
The addition of such strong bracers, boots and belts may make it less desirable to wear T2. The best pieces of T2 had been the belt, bracers and boots. However, we now have some very strong gear for these slots. Also, haste could become more more beneficial in Patch 2.4 to healers. It might make wearing T2 provide only a marginal boost to chain healing. I'll try to do some theorycrafting based on the Sunwell gear and post the results. <br>
<br>
Also, in case anyone was curious, the healing co-efficient for Earth Shield did not change on the PTR when the charges were reduced. It remains 30% per charge.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>yeah I been wondering what to do about 3pc t2 now. I haven't decided I think 3pc t2 would still be better than the new t6 pcs but my desire to wear them has dropped a good deal. If only they made a 8pc bonus and made it the same as 3pc t2 then we would have the ultimate chain heal set.. <br>
<br>
I kept forgetting to look at the mana cost for eath shield was I was on did you happen to notice it? I was curious if the mana efficiency of earth shield changed or they just mage it about the same per change and reduced the charges.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">The "Upgrades" tab is a static page on which you manually select your upgrades. It won't automatically update. I believe Binkenstein intended it as a quick reference guide so you could see all your upgrades at a glance. So if the other pages are sorting by HEP (Helm, neck, etc) then you are using the spreadsheet correctly.<br>
<br>
==========<br>
<br>
Which four pieces of Tier 6 do you plan on wearing once eight pieces become available? The bracers, boots and belt seem to be the strongest pieces, along with either the helm or shoulders. There are much better non-set pieces of legs, chest and gloves. <br>
<br>
The addition of such strong bracers, boots and belts may make it less desirable to wear T2. The best pieces of T2 had been the belt, bracers and boots. However, we now have some very strong gear for these slots. Also, haste could become more more beneficial in Patch 2.4 to healers. It might make wearing T2 provide only a marginal boost to chain healing. I'll try to do some theorycrafting based on the Sunwell gear and post the results. <br>
<br>
Also, in case anyone was curious, the healing co-efficient for Earth Shield did not change on the PTR when the charges were reduced. It remains 30% per charge.</div>

</div>My plan was to use Boots, Belt, Bracers, Shoulders.<br>
Against my current gear the shoulders will be the smallest upgrade to the "new" gear.  Although if I wasn't able to get the new Leather working chest I would probably have kept my t6 chest.  I also estimated that I will have ~350 passive haste(~21%) which is insane, lol.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">yeah I been wondering what to do about 3pc t2 now. I haven't decided I think 3pc t2 would still be better than the new t6 pcs but my desire to wear them has dropped a good deal. If only they made a 8pc bonus and made it the same as 3pc t2 then we would have the ultimate chain heal set.. <br>
<br>
I kept forgetting to look at the mana cost for eath shield was I was on did you happen to notice it? I was curious if the mana efficiency of earth shield changed or they just mage it about the same per change and reduced the charges.</div>
			
		</td>

</div>I *think* it was 450 mana, so 75 mana per charge. It currently costs 900 mana for 10 charges, or 90 mana per charge. So each charge will cost 16.7% less mana to cast but you will have to cast it 40% more often. Shamans already spend a lot of time on the GCD due to water shield and totems. So I greet the new Earth Shield with mixed emotions. Obviously, the lower mana cost really helps in PVP where it gets dispelled quickly. It doesn't really matter in an arena whether it has 6 or 10 charges. Only 1-2 will go off before it's gone.<br>
<br>
So any chance that Blizzard extended the untalented range of totems to 30 yards (40 yards with talents) and just forgot to mention it in the PTR notes? No? Sigh...<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_640703"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Hi--I'm a long time lurker, first time poster. Posting this as a test balloon. I'd like to know if you find this useful, and when I continue development on this application whether you would want me to post revised versions here.<br>
<br>
Using a series of Ruby scripts I've been working on for about two weeks, I wrote an application to automatically parse live data out of Wowhead and into a spreadsheet. I <b>do</b> have written permission from Wowhead to do this, so don't jump my case on that. &gt;_&gt; As for taking two weeks, I wrote a comprehensive library for building this spreadsheet and didn't just hack together a script; as a result, I have a durable application that can generate almost any class/spec a gear spreadsheet from live Wowhead data.<br>
<br>
The spreadsheet format is OpenOffice Calc. If you don't have OpenOffice, get it. It's free.<br>
<br>
This is an early iteration of the spreadsheet, with all data intact but very little "polish". Later I'll add things like coloration, links to items, full tooltips on mouseover, etc. For now, it works, and I just wanted to get it out there. <b>It does include gear from patch 2.4.</b><br>
<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080429233220/http://www.nexusarcanus.net/wow/shaman_heal_gear_sunwell.ods" target="_blank">Resto Shaman Gear Spreadsheet (Including 2.4 Loot)</a><br>
<br>
A brief FAQ:<br>
<br>
<b>What is 10MM?</b><br>
This is a stat I developed called "10 minute mana". Most fights in raids are between 5 and 15 minutes, with most enrage timers being 10 minutes or so. So, the 10MM stat takes into account your int, mp5, and two mana tide totems (one at 2m30s, one at 7m30s) for total mana provided during a 10 minute fight. (You can adjust the length of the fight on the Control tab. The stat is still called "10 minute mana" but will reflect the mana gained from the piece for whatever fight length you choose.)<br>
<br>
<b>What about the other stats?</b><br>
Columns B through K are pure stats pulled off of the gear. 10MM, Heal, Haste, and Sta are derived stats based on the gear itself and any gems you have socketed. You can control what your gems are worth on the Control tab. Note that the Heal stat also accounts for the 10% bonus that the priest spirit buff provides from Spirit, but otherwise spirit is not counted.<br>
<br>
<b>What is Ranking?</b><br>
Item level calculation is based on modifiers, stats, and powers of stats, etc. etc., in a complicated formula. Ranking is simply an expression of the calculated stats (10MM, Heal, Haste, Sta) that roughly mirrors item level calculations. It does not take powers or any other nonsense; it's a pure expression of what the item is "worth" to a resto shaman at flat value. 10MM is counted as though entirely made up of MP5 for more accurate rankings. <b>Important:</b> Ranking is NOT an official stat or a hard-line rule of any kind. It is a value used to approximately rank gear that transcends item level, and items of similar rank should be examined heavily for various advantages on the derived stats.<br>
<br>
<b>What happened to Int?</b><br>
Int is a dumb stat. When you get a point of int, you actually get a little crit, a little mana, and a little healing. You also get a little more mana if you mana tide. Int (including tides) has been broken up and shuffled off into the calculated stats so that it will mix with healing and 10MM for more abstract comparison.<br>
<br>
<b>What happened to spell crit?</b><br>
While shamans do get some benefit from spell crit via talents, it's not significant enough to focus on for PvE itemization.  Furthermore, the PvP gear has all the crit you really need if you really want to focus on it. So, I did not parse it at all.<br>
<br>
<b>What about trinkets and relics?</b><br>
These are a small, well-defined subset of gear pieces with very few distributed stats. A spreadsheet will do very little good when comparing them. When choosing trinkets and a relic, consult Wowhead comments for guidance.<br>
<br>
<b>Does the sheet account for socket bonuses?</b><br>
No. The formulas required to account for all socket bonuses would be unbelievably long. Sorry, you'll have to work on that yourself.  If you want to see what a piece of gear would be like if you don't socket the correct gems, just change the count for other gems in the item.<br>
<br>
<b>You're not counting set bonuses / procs / sexy graphics!</b><br>
No, I'm not. This is for broad-base pure stat analysis for quick calculations without having to crunch the math yourself on every item you want to compare. When weighing two pieces of gear that are about the same tier, you will have to judge a lot more than what's simply on this spreadsheet. My goal is that the spreadsheet will make this math easier.<br>
<br>
Enjoy. <br>

		<div id="post_message_641603"><!-- google_ad_section_start --><i>Patch 2.4<br>
* Spirit-Based Mana Regeneration: This system has been adjusted so that as your intellect rises, you will regenerate more mana per point of spirit.</i><br>
<br>
<b>So what does this mean for Shaman?</b><br>
<br>
Very little.<br>
<br>
The change only affects mana regeneration outside of the 5-second rule. Most shaman spend close to 100% of their time within the five second rule. This is primarily due to the fact that 1) We lack HoTs 2) If we’re not healing, we are dropping totems and refreshing Water Shield.<br>
<br>
Spirit remains mostly irrelevant when evaluating gear. <br>
<br>
However, we are going to see an increase in our mana regeneration outside the FSR. The average shaman (with full raid buffs including spirit) will gain about 116 mp5 while not casting. Divine Spirit alone will be worth an extra 36 mp5 while not casting. <br>
<br>
You may also hear a lot of talk about how certain elixirs and flasks will become better choices. Nothing has changed for the shaman class in this regard.<br>
<br>
Well Fed +8 mp5 &gt; Well Fed +20 spirit<br>
Flask of Restoration &gt; Flask of Distilled Wisdom<br>
<br>
Let’s take the following example. <br>
<br>
Buffed = Arcane Int, BoK, BoW, Mark, Divine Spirit, Improved Mana Spring, Water shield<br>
NOTE: You can get another 49 mp5 while casting from food, oils and a flask.<br>
<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080429233220/http://img249.imageshack.us/my.php?image=spiritme6.png" target="_blank"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080429233220im_/http://img249.imageshack.us/img249/9610/spiritme6.png" border="0" alt=""></a><br>
<b>How can I see how this change will affect my mana regen outside the 5-second rule?</b><br>
<br>
To input your own spirit, intellect and mp5, I recommend using one of these spreadsheets: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080429233220/http://shannonskipper.googlepages.com/MP5.xls" target="_blank">http://shannonskipper.googlepages.com/MP5.xls</a><br>

It's the same spreadsheet but two different people are updating it. <br>
<br>
Please be aware that the authors are still refining the spreadsheet and it is often updated a few times each day. Also, please note that I modified my spreadsheet to include water shield and that is not yet an option on the original spreadsheet (although I requested the author add it). <br>
<br>
If you really want to get into the nitty gritty details of the change (you math lovers), here is the EJ thread on the topic: <br>

	</tbody></table>
</div>Those values are not arbitrary. Those are stat values used in calculating item level. I did not use the powers formula for calculating item value, but instead took a flat value comparison. (If I took the actual iLevel, it would be unnecessarily complex; taking a flat ranking will show two-stat items for their true "value" compared to four-stat items.) Check <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080429233220/http://www.wowwiki.com/Formulas:Item_Values" target="_blank">here</a> for details. Go back and read my FAQ; the "Ranking" stat is NOT meant as a hard-line indicator of an item's value. It is primarily to order the items roughly in terms of their value to healing shamans. Individual differences between items need to be gauged by hand by looking at the four derived stats.<br>
<br>
Likewise, 10 Minute Mana does not have an arbitrary worth. As I said in the FAQ (again, please go read it), I took the 10 Minute Mana stat and weighted it as though it were entirely made of MP5. Basically this means that the "Ranking" stat does away with Int entirely; Int is converted to MP5 based on how long the fight is supposed to last as indicated in the Control tab (also taking tides into account).<br>
<br>
I think you're misunderstanding the intention of the "Ranking" stat. It is a quasi-arbitrary number that closely mirrors the way item level is actually calculated. I flagged as "Important" in my FAQ above that you should NOT look at Ranking exclusively when comparing gear. The four derived stats are the true intention of that spreadsheet.<br>
<br>
Why include Ranking at all? Sorting. Item level is not arbitration; it's a core functionality of the game and determines which bosses drop specific loot. If I did *not* provide a stat that approximates item level ranking, then most people who use the spreadsheet seriously would have to *create* one in order to figure out approximately what value to put on items. I will not give you a dynamic formula to create your own rankings, because something like "Heal Equivalent Points" is a rather ludicrous concept. You choose items based on their uses; one might be fast, one might give you a lot of mana, one might spike your healing, and one might give you the health needed to endure certain fights. THOSE are the real rankings, and the variables they represent are fully independent and each have to be considered. The "Ranking" stat simply brings those values together for the purpose of sorting.<br>
<br>
Another purpose of ranking (as opposed to item level) is to be able to provide a place in the chart for items that have Spirit, Spell Crit, or Resilience on them, without actually taking those values into consideration, insofar as they don't affect the four derived stats (as Spirit does a little because of the priest buff). When these items are present, the "Ranking" stat will be lower than would be normal for the item level, due to the stat being counted as zero (or near zero in the case of Spirit). Furthermore, item level values take each stat to a power (1.5 is the suspected value), add them, and then take the inverse power (.66). This means that items with only two stats (such as the <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28609" target="_blank">[Emberspur Talisman]</a>) is a lot more "expensive" in item level because it's two high stats instead of four more evenly distributed stats. Ranking does away with that entirely; taking each stat as a flat value will smooth out those spikes and allow for a more neutral comparison.<br>
<br>
What you're left with, regarding Ranking, is a list that from top to bottom closely mirrors the progression chart of the game. The top of the chart is Sunwell, then BT/Hyjal, then SSC/TK, then tier 4 content. Places where they don't match up are where you need to get a "shaman worth value" of an item that isn't meant for the class (such as resto druid gear), or for loot that doesn't precisely match a tier (such as badge loot, *some* crafted items, and PVP gear). As an added benefit, the chart can be automatically updated within minutes the moment Wowhead refreshes live data. <br>

</div>Loot Rank is dumb. (I don't use it, but I'm assuming it gives you a raw value based on your own rankings of stats.) Let's say I'm about to do a long, looooooong fight. I have <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28765" target="_blank">[Stainless Cloak of the Pure Hearted]</a> and <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33592" target="_blank">[Cloak of Ancient Rituals]</a> in my inventory. If I blindly equipped stuff because Loot Rank told me to, then I'd equip the Cloak, right? By formula, it's more valuable. Hell, it comes from ZA, and the first one comes from Kara! Obviously the second is better.<br>
<br>
This is a rather extreme example, because you can see that the stainless cloak has mp5 on it. The purpose of my spreadsheet is to show you how *much* of a mana advantage you'll get (a whopping 1500 mana over 10 min) for how much healing you lose (3 healing and 25 haste rating). You didn't pick up a calculator to see that; it's right there on the sheet. THAT is precise evidence, none of this "well, I got this in ZA, and that cloak *only* has 7 mp5...". Also, you get perspective on comparisons like that one; seeing all the gear shows you just how many pieces give you a higher 10MM than the regen piece you're looking at.<br>
<br>
Another example that's relevant to me: I have <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28520" target="_blank">[Gloves of Centering]</a> as one of my few remaining kara pieces. I still use them and never bothered to get the tier4 gloves because we always have alts in our Kara badge runs and I don't really need them. Also, I never wanted to spend the badges on <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33531" target="_blank">[Polished Waterscale Gloves]</a> because I didn't consider more mp5 and LESS healing a very significant upgrade. (Pure +Healing is, after all, the epeen stat that transcends class.) However, I can see now that it gives me almost 1k more mana, 80 more health (every little bit helps), and only drops healing by 14. Furthermore, only two other pieces in the game (<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32353" target="_blank">[Gloves of Unfailing Faith]</a> and <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=34409" target="_blank">[Gauntlets of the Ancient Frostwolf]</a>) have a higher 10MM, and both of those are currently prohibitive. Definitely worth buying the badge gloves to go into my regen set.<br>
<br>
<b>My comparison sheet:</b><br>
<br>
Let me upload my current comparison sheet that I was hunched over last night. My raid group is in late Tier 5 content, and working on Kael to break into Tier 6 content. For the sheet, I changed a few values to account for socket bonuses (something that I will be including in a future version). The pieces I have are "outlined", the pieces I am currently targeting are in bold.<br>

Second, as Hodor said, this concept of 10MM is intriguing. It would be great to know if my gear would get me through a certain fight. I hope you will take Hodor’s comments and mine and use them to refine your spreadsheet. I would really like to see a revised version.<br>
<br>
My question is: How does this differ from Shamstats? Shamstats currently tells you how long you can sustain casting depending on your gear, talents and buffs and which spells you are casting.<br>

<br>
1) Healers can never, ever reduce stats to a simple one-point system like EP is for enhance shamans.<br>
2) I like the idea of trying to synthesize stats on a 10 min fight, but does your spreadsheets look at regen needs and HPS needs?<br>
<br>
Haste is getting a stupid amount of attention in this thread. Ok, it's really cool to tick in #1 at RoS or Bloodboil, but <i>there is no fight in live content that requires haste</i>. Not one fight. It bumps up your potential HPS at the expense of longevity. Enjoying your 2x spriest group? Fine. It's not worth filling up this thread with.<br>
<br>
Just like Skyhoof, I want to know where these multipliers used in the spreadsheets come from. Are they pulled from thin air? If this is the case(and "these come from having been in end-game content for a long time" doesn't cut it. Math is God), stop posting them. <br>
<br>
This is my deterministic way of doing gear:<br>
1) Get X regen. For me this is around 150 mp5, <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=25901" target="_blank">[Insightful Earthstorm Diamond]</a>, <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30663" target="_blank">[Fathom-Brooch of the Tidewalker]</a> and <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=13503" target="_blank">[Alchemist's Stone]</a>. (Silly Illidan never drops MoT)<br>
2) Stack +heal.<br>
3) Profit.<br>
<br>
I have a few items with +haste, which is nice and I swap them in for some fights or just to look better on meters. I should wear more pure +heal gear because I'm never in danger of running OOM, but I'm lazy. The fundamental part of my gear is still my set amount of regen and having spent most of my remaining item budget on +heal. +heal doubles as regen when your spriest blows up or is MIA(downranking). It's pure HPS when you are chugging pots and flasks, and it's (quite) easily obtainable.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

2) I like the idea of trying to synthesize stats on a 10 min fight, but does your spreadsheets look at regen needs and HPS needs?<br>
<br>
Haste is getting a stupid amount of attention in this thread. Ok, it's really cool to tick in #1 at RoS or Bloodboil, but <i>there is no fight in live content that requires haste</i>. Not one fight. It bumps up your potential HPS at the expense of longevity. Enjoying your 2x spriest group? Fine. It's not worth filling up this thread with.<br>
<br>
Just like Skyhoof, I want to know where these multipliers used in the spreadsheets come from. Are they pulled from thin air? If this is the case(and "these come from having been in end-game content for a long time" doesn't cut it. Math is God), stop posting them. <br>
<br>
This is my deterministic way of doing gear:<br>
1) Get X regen. For me this is around 150 mp5, <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=25901" target="_blank">[Insightful Earthstorm Diamond]</a>, <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30663" target="_blank">[Fathom-Brooch of the Tidewalker]</a> and <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=13503" target="_blank">[Alchemist's Stone]</a>. (Silly Illidan never drops MoT)<br>
2) Stack +heal.<br>
3) Profit.<br>
<br>
I have a few items with +haste, which is nice and I swap them in for some fights or just to look better on meters. I should wear more pure +heal gear because I'm never in danger of running OOM, but I'm lazy. The fundamental part of my gear is still my set amount of regen and having spent most of my remaining item budget on +heal. +heal doubles as regen when your spriest blows up or is MIA(downranking). It's pure HPS when you are chugging pots and flasks, and it's (quite) easily obtainable.</div>

</div>Haste might not be needed in any fight, but haste can also make fights easier. It has nothing to do with 'meters' (i top them with or without haste).<br>
The attention haste was getting is the fact that there were no numbers on it, and very little tested or theorycrafted on it. Now, if it sucks, it sucks, but i'd rather have the numbers there to prove it sucks than just blindly saying so.<br>
If as you say, "it's pure HPS", then haste will increase your hps far more than +heal will on a point for point basis, especially once you get to 2k+heal.<br>
<br>
It's all about balance, the particular fight and your healing assignment. I prefer Eye of Gruul to Fathom Brooch on most occasions. In fact, since getting the Fathom Brooch i've found it distinctly underwhelming and even prefer Ribbon of Sacrifice. Why Eye of Gruul; it's +heal and chance to restore mana and as i'm mostly chain casting chain heal it works out better. <br>
Do i run oom with or without haste. No. Each to their own. At least if you have the information you can make an 'informed' decision on whether or not it is good for you.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Of course haste brings your HPS potential up. But for what? A few posts ago, people were talking about how to bring LHW down to 1 second. Or CH down to 1.5. It's just silly.<br>
<br>
Rank 5 CH = 540 mana<br>
w/ T6 2p + Tidal Focus = 540*0.9*0.95 = 461.70<br>
<br>
wowwiki:<br>
New Casting Time = Base Casting Time / (1 + (Spell Haste Rating/1570))<br>
<br>
Let's say you bring 200 haste into the picture. Your mana usage was 461.70*2 = 923.40 mp5. With 200 haste your mana usage is:<br>
<br>
2.5/(1 + (200/1570)) = 2.22<br>
5/2.22 = 2.25<br>
461.70 * 2.25 = 1038.83 mp5<br>
<br>
In a 1 minute window you are able to get off 60/2.5 = 24 un-hasted CHs. With 200 haste: 60/2.22 = 27.03. <br>
<br>
Yes, those three extra CHs may be gold on that fight, but you just upped your mana usage by 115.43 mp5 and all that haste had to cut into your item budget somewhere.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>It is not silly at all if you actually get the point of the discussion. People were calculating these in order to estimate the cap on haste, beyond which haste becomes nearly useless. <br>
<br>
In order to discuss further your point of haste being useless, I'll just underline something simple : as you said yourself haste allows to get a higher HPS at the expense of a higher mana usage (higher than without haste, because haste do NOT decrease the HPM of your spells). But why are we shamans even in the raid in the first place, it is to produce some healing, not having a full mana bar at the end of the fight. What I mean by this is that HPS is the only real important stat and mana regen is basically useless until you go oom. And honestly with the changes to water shield I find it really hard to go oom even without a shadow priest.<br>
<br>
In conclusion, you have to learn to love haste ! ;-))<br>

</div>I would argue that haste can be necessary.  Now granted my guild does crazy things for dps I know this however lets take Azgalor.  Our melee don't run out and we bring minimal healers to every fight.  So Azgalor is 2 Shaman 2 pallys and a priest/druid.  HPS on this fight is everything.  Getting as many heals off between silences is the difference between a wipe and a kill.  I wear every single bit of haste I can and blow all my "clicky" trinkets on this fight constantly hoping I will get out of silence and hoping for scarab procs so my chains will bounce to the melee before they die.   Can you do the fight a different way? Sure but thats not how my guild prefers to do it so HPS is not some luxury to pad my meter, is an absolute necessity.<br>
<br>
Basically higher HPS allows you to bring fewer healers / doing crazy semi-suicidal things  upping your dps.   Brutalis seems to a good example of high dps high HPS needed.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_644343"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Hey Skyhoof, just noticed something and thought you might want to make a slight change in the guide under the totemic focus section.<br>
<br>
<i>Totemic Focus: Reduces the cost of your totems by 25%. It provides a bigger benefit than Ancestral Knowledge. At worst, it will probably equate to giving you an extra 4.6 mp5 (Scenario 1). At best, it could give you the equivalent of 11.8 mp5 (Scenario 2).<br>
<br>
Scenario 2: You are in a melee group dropping Windfury, Strength of Earth, Healing stream and Searing Totem.<br>
Windfury: 325 mana<br>
Strength: 300 mana<br>
Healing: 95 mana<br>
Searing: 205 mana x 2<br>
Total: 5,650 mana during a 10 minute fight. The talent would save you 1,412 mana or 11.8 mp5</i><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Assuming this is a ten minute fight with 10 casts of searing wouldn't overall dps be higher if a fire Elemental were tossed in at some point? So removing 2X searing and adding one fire elemental @ 680 mana gives you 12.2 mp5.<br>
<br>
Also i think we can safely say that this talent is worth more in reality than on paper. I find myself (and would assume that  others do as well) refreshing totems often before the entire duration is up when i have GCD's to spare as a precautionary move. Given even a 5% margin of error you would need a whole new set refreshes adding another 925 mana or the regen up to 14.1. Add to this two uses of Mana tide and things look even better.<br>
<br>
By no means am i suggesting that this is a "must have" talent, but i do believe that you should bump the mp5 numbers that it returns upwards slightly as it does preform better than listed.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I'm going to review some random WWS parces from t5-t6 and look at total totems cast and see if i can find a practical average value for this talent. Going to leave out t4  even though a longish Maiden fight for a new Kara guild might be the best bank for the buck with the talent.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I understand your point better : you don't feel that the usefulness of spell haste is in line with its cost in item budget. I agree that spell haste is quite expensive in that regard. However we should also note that we get more overall stats on an item if the budget is spent on more different stats. So we get more stats on an item with haste, heal and mp5 than on an item with only heal and mp5, at equal item level. <br>
<br>
In any event all healers will have to adapt their playstyle when their haste increases, with more deranking and the such, in order to make the most of haste. It's not like we have much choice anyway since all healing items in sunwell have haste rating (from what I've seen) <!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_644499"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I would also argue that there are days in which Haste is an absolute necessity for me as well. An example is Illidan Phase 2. Normally we heal the raid with two CoH priests plus me. I don't really need that much HPS for that since we got it down pretty well, but there are days when one of these priests don't show up. During these days there's only two of us healing the raid for Illidan phase 2. I tried it once without my spell haste gear. People died. I put on my spell haste gear and the difference was like night and day.<br>
<br>
So the moral of the story is, whether or not you NEED spell haste depends on the other healers in your raid. Healing is a teamwork effort. If you bring a lot of healers who are on the ball, your job is to be reliable and make sure nobody dies. If you bring a very small amount of healers to push DPS, you had better make sure your HPS is high enough to support it.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<b>Clarification on item weights</b><br>

When blizzard calculates item level for any given item, it uses a formula. As one step in this formula, it applies a modifier to the value itself to make it line up with the other stats. In other words, 1 Int may equal 1 Spell Haste Rating (and every other rating, for that matter), but 1 Int != 1 Sta, and 1 Int != 1 Healing.<br>
<br>
Let's say you have two items of the same item level. One has NOTHING but healing, one has NOTHING but int. The two values are different. But if you multiply the Healing by 0.455, it will then be equal to the int. It's a way of budgeting stats, and it's the method Blizzard uses to put a value on what each stat is worth.<br>
<br>
So what is Ranking? It's taking the four derived values and coming up with a value that roughly mirrors the way item level is calculated. As I have reiterated many times, though, you can't take Ranking as anything more than a sorting algorithm, and you focus on the four derived stats.<br>

</div>I'm not saying Shamstats is bad, but it tries to accomplish waaaay too much. It has a lot of bells and whistles, and that's fine. (It also can't be opened by OpenOffice without a ton of errors, but whatever.) However, it's geared to be the most useful to elemental shamans, who need to know how much X crit or X spell damage is worth based on everything they have equipped or are buffed with. (This is the same for nearly every other DPS class/spec--the value of certain stats changes depending on what they have equipped.) Healers have no such restriction. Healing, Mana, Haste, and Stamina are four entirely independent variables. My spreadsheet is simply designed to illustrate the differences between items in a clear fashion.<br>
<br>
As for my comments on HEP: I explained thoroughly in my last post why I feel that trying to come up with some sort of HEP (which is similar, but distinct from the Ranking stat) is a bad idea. I feel that most resto shamans should carry around at least as much gear in their bag as they have equipped, and swap pieces out for different fights based on their needs. The point is, items cannot be valued solely on one culmination of some formula, and that be the "one set" they will equip in every fight. Fights are different, and if you find yourself running out of mana, you need more regen and less healing. If your mana pool is fine, you need less regen and more healing/haste.<br>
<br>
Perhaps I should run another example to illustrate my point:<br>
<i><a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28522" target="_blank">[Shard of the Virtuous]</a> never dropped for me in the 8 or so months I farmed kara, so I finally just got <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32451" target="_blank">[Gladiator's Salvation]</a> to fill the gap until I could get a new healing mace. This was a few months ago. It turns out in 2.4, <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=34896" target="_blank">[Gavel of Naaru Blessings]</a> is badge loot! So should I care about Shard anymore? Intuition says no, as the Gavel is ranked at 251 (and only the <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32500" target="_blank">[Crystal Spire of Karabor]</a> puts out more healing), while the lowly Shard is only ranked at 196 and more than 100 less healing. But, I'm still going to get it, and put it in my bag. Why? Shard has more than 1000 more 10MM, and I'm going to put Spellsurge onto it. It will cut a deep gouge into my +Healing, but if I and other caster DPS put in my group with me are running out of mana in a long fight, I need to equip it to do my job. It's a situational item, and I don't expect to use it a whole lot, but I will have it when I need it.</i><br>

</div>I wasn't; I was illustrating why HEP or a formula to determine the "total effectiveness" of a gear is a bad idea to blindly RELY on. (If it was anything, it was more of a warranted argument than an unwarranted assumption.) In the next paragraph I explained that it was an <i>extreme </i>example. The paragraph after that, I illustrated an example of my own experience, and why looking at the four derived values helped me get a better handle on the value of a piece of gear I was looking at.<br>
<br>
<b>IRT Raut</b><br>
<br>
Not quoting directly but, I believe you're expecting more out of the sheet than I intended. This is not meant to evaluate the gear you have on and determine whether you need more regen, or HPS, or whatever. All of these values are left up to the user. Relying on a single spreadsheet to tell you exactly how much regen you need to heal for X minutes at Y hps leaves you wide open to all sorts of variables like how other healers are performing, whether you have to run to reposition, whether the tank gets crit/crushed, whether emergencies happen and you have to pop swift Healing Ways, or spam LHW to keep a tank alive, etc. Let's say you come up with a flat value: I can heal for X minutes at Y hps. Both of those are going to be like 20% fuzzy either way based on what happens in a particular fight, right? So why come up with a precise value?<br>
<br>
All of these things are serious considerations but I believe they are outside the scope of simple gear comparison. You can do that with Shamstats if you like; that's fine. <b>The purpose of this spreadsheet is simply to consider what items you want to target based on the differences between the gear you have and your target gear, as well as compare pieces you have for their purpose in various fights.</b> It is also designed to illustrate the differences between, let's say, the top 10 pieces in the game for various slots.<br>
<br>
I also believe that coming up with something like "get 150 mp5 then stack +Healing" is fine for a rule of thumb "normal" set, but not having extra regen gear or extra haste/healing gear in your inventory to fit different fights is just coming unprepared. Use itemrack to set up balanced, healing, haste, regen, and stamina sets based on the gear you own. Swap into them for fights that require them. If you have a boss on farm, then one set fits all; if you're trying to progress, you need to change your gear around every attempt to fit what the last attempt's problems were like.<br>
<br>
<b>In conclusion:</b><br>
<br>
The sheet I made has a few advantages (for me, at least):<br>
 1. I do not believe that coming up with HEP or analysing <b>all</b> gear you have equipped plus buffs is necessary for simple gear comparison. This sheet accomplishes all its goals with no extra weight.<br>
 2. This sheet gives you four completely independent variables characteristic to ALL shaman-equippable healing gear, while completely ignoring crit, resilience, and spirit (except as it applies to healing w/priest buff).<br>
 3. <b>Most Important:</b> I can generate this sheet from scratch within minutes based on live Wowhead data and it will be complete as-is. Further, I can modify the format and appearance of the sheet as much as I want, and just re-run the script to generate everything in its completeness. Further, and perhaps most interesting, is that it uses an abstract system that I can provide to any class, any spec.<br>
<br>
The sheet isn't "everything and the kitchen sink". The kitchen sink is fine, but wildly unnecessary for healers my view. If you're just looking at comparing gear specific to a slot, then four independent variables between pieces is all you really need.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Maybe this thread needs a 2D graph showing HPS on one axis and fight length on the other. "Fight Y needs a HPS of 2000 over six minutes. This is how you can gear for it". <br>

</div>Oddly enough, the itemisation budget does not actually reflect how useful an item is to a healing shaman. Generally, yes, an item with a higher ilvl than another will be better, but it may not be better for the situation at hand.<br>
A good example would be comparing T4 &amp; T5 resto gear. Sure, T5 has a higher ilvl, but the increase in healing output does not scale with this due to the extra crit on some items (which relates to the recently nerfed 4pc set bonus). In some situations, you'll find people actually stick with some T4 items over T5 because of it.<br>

Yes, it can, mathematically, but realistically there are so many variables involved in non-gear-check fights that such a calculation is moot at best. I would argue more along the lines of "equip regen until you don't have mana problems anymore." That's purely an opinion. I do think, however, that having "a couple extra pieces" for different situations doesn't cut it. I have 15 pieces of gear in my bag that I use (and I do use ALL of them at different times) situationally. Every healer should do the same, it's how you maximize your potential.<br>

</div>No--I don't total the gear. The intention is NOT to say "you have X amount of 10MM total for your character." If I ever do create gear totals, then I would include those things.

</div>Ok, let me outline this (and I'll put this in a FAQ next time I release the sheet) since the formulas can be a bit obscure. All of these are direct, however. There's no fudged math, it's intuitive.<br>
<br>
<b>How stats in my sheet are calculated:</b><br>
@gem_val - means this value accounting for all gems. (Use the Control tab to determine what gems are worth.)<br>
@budget(stat) - means this value at the budget for "stat", SCALED using Blizzard's item level "stat value" modifier. (0.455 for healing, 2/3 for Stamina, etc.)<br>
TP_AK - talent points in Ancestral Knowledge<br>
N_TIDE - number of times mana tide is used (by default, 2m30s into the fight and every 5 min thereafter)<br>
F_LEN - length of the fight in minutes<br>
<br>
<u>1. Raw stats</u> - Int, Sta, Spirit, Healing, MP5, Spell Haste, Red/Blue/Yellow/Meta sockets are all parsed from the tooltip. This does NOT include socket bonuses yet. (They may at some point, I haven't put the parser necessary for that into place.)<br>
<br>
2. <u>Derived stats:</u><br>
- Hit Points = Stamina[@gem_val] * 10<br>
- Haste = Spell Haste[@gem_val]<br>
- Spell Healing = Healing[@gem_val] + Intellect[@gem_val] * 0.3 + Spirit[@gem_val] * 0.1<br>
- 10MM = ( Intellect[@gem_val] * 15 * (1 + TP_AK * 0.01) * (1 + N_TIDE * .24) ) + ( MP5[@gem_val] * 20 * F_LEN )<br>
- Ranking = (Hit Points / 10)[@budget(Stamina)] + Haste[@budget(Haste)] + Spell Healing[@budget(Healing)] + 10MM[@budget(MP5)]<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Erm, I've explained at least 4-5 times how I value them. Read this:<br>

<br>
Blizzard uses scalars to make all stats equivalent on a 1 to 1 basis. I simply reduce the four derived values to their scaled values and add them. (No powers nonsense; while that works for item level, it's bad for direct comparison.)<br>

</div>Useful to whom? I've made quite a few arguments regarding why anything beyond comparing gear piece-by-piece is rather superfluous. Check my other posts. I boiled my sheet down to its essentials. Since the value modifications (10MM, sta, haste, heal) of any particular item do not rely on the overall accumulated stats, this is all you really need (for healing). For elemental or enhancement, that's another story.<br>
<br>
Would you like me to work with you on your spreadsheet? Adjusting the code I've written to parse live data and drop it into your sheet wouldn't be too difficult. You would need to make it OpenOffice-compatible though, because I've only written the OpenOffice Calc WIN32OLE API into my program, not Excel's. (And Excel's is kind of a pain in the ass.)<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_645030"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Looking at your spreadsheet again, this is what I conclude:<br>
The Ranking value is (relatively) irrelevant.<br>
<br>
Your Spreadsheet has the singular purpose of comparing several items with each other.<br>
<br>
It sums up the +healing and the haste rating on each item and lists them in a table.<br>
<br>
Lastly, it adds up how much mana you would have (only from this item) during an arbitrary fight length (standard 10 minutes). This is the new and most useful thing of this spreadsheet. It lets you say, that if I wear this piece of gear over that other one, I will have 3000 mana more, but 50 +heal less than with that other item.<br>
<br>
If I understood you correctly, I would suggest the folowing:<br>
1) Remove the Ranking value.<br>
2) Make it possible to sort the gear by either +heal, +haste, or 10MM.<br>
<br>
In short: the useful thing is the 10 MM idea. Don't weigh it down with useless stuff (ranking). Either you want to "rank" items (in which case you need the "Ranking" value which is relatively hard to do correctly - if at all possible), or you simly want to give an additional way to compare two (or more) items with each other - in which case you should remove the "Ranking" value.<br>
<br>
In conclusion: I think the 10 MM idea is terrific and should be used. The rest is meh.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Correct. It has two purposes.<br>
1. Sorting gear into appropriate tiers based on value to resto shamans. (i.e., make Sunwell loot come first, then BT/Hyjal, etc.)<br>
2. Approximate the value of gear that does not fit into these tiers, such as Spirit healing gear, badge loot, some craftables, PVP loot, etc., and then insert that into the table for rule-of-thumb comparison.<br>
<br>
However, I would remind you that any such equivalence--including some sort of HEP calculation--has the same benefits and drawbacks. I suppose I should probably rename the stat "Approximate Value" or "Relative Value", or something else, to make it more clear.<br>

		<div id="post_message_645053"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Ok, so you're doing ilvl comparisons with certain stats removed. I guess that works... but I think you're undervaluing Heal quite a bit.<br>
<br>
You will get a 10% bonus to any +heal point, and an additional 18% if using HW with the healing way talent. This is something that I don't think that you're handling.<br>
<br>
So you're not actually "ranking" the items by any practical basis, you're sorting them by useful ilvl.<br>
If I did that for Elemental gear, Crit rating would be worth more than spell damage, and would be worth the same as Haste. This is not the case (generally it's Haste&gt;Dmg&gt;Crit).<br>
<br>
I'm thinking about doing an OpenOffice port as I've finally installed it, and making both OO and Excel versions available for a while to see which is more popular.

</div>You're right, I'm not. I forgot about Purification. I'll boost it by 10%, but I won't consider Healing Way, for three primary reasons:<br>
1. The evaluation really needs to transcend what heal you use, otherwise you start getting into LHW vs CH vs HW. In the middle of a fight, you can't swap most of your gear, and the use of LHW and HW is highly situational.<br>
2. The primary heal shamans will use in all boss fights is CH. This is my opinion. I will back it up with analysis if you deem it necessary (and want to have a discussion on it), but I imagine most of it would be rehash of other things said in this 20-page thread.<br>
3. If you do use HW exclusively, it will be on MT healing. And in ALL MT healing situations, you have to overheal because HW is a really, really long cast. Since you cannot spam HW for very long without totally running dry, you will have to downrank (to about 6-8) to spam it. Once you downrank, all these calculations get a little tricky and subjective, and goes beyond the scope of simple values on a spreadsheet, and becomes more of a "how much do you downrank" discussion. Even then, simply swapping from one of the chain heal relics to one of the HW relics will make more difference in the long run.<br>

</div>Elemental calculation is quite different, though. Each stat for elemental shamans has a variable delta value based on all your other gear combined. (This is why I agree with you on the point that all buffs must be accounted for in your elemental gear spreadsheet.) For the case of healers, each of the four variables I calculate are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080420222708/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_independence" target="_blank">mutually independent</a> variables. I use that term with precise meaning: an increase in any one stat does not affect any of the other stats. In the case of elemental gear, an increase in crit (for example) will change the value delta of a point of damage.<br>
<br>
So, while it makes sense to make arbitrary (and subjective) alterations to elemental gear ranking, such is NOT required (nor advised, really) for healing gear. An item level equivalence is sufficient (and really, as neutral as can be expected).<br>
<br>
If it comes do it, I will add personal weights to the Control tab to make Ranking more subjective, instead of just hiding it. But I maintain that you CANNOT say, for example, "MP5 is more valuable than its ilevel ranking for shamans for ALL fights". There is absolutely no basis for that claim, and due to the mutual independence of the four healing stats, it is impossible to create any basis for it.<br>
<br>
For example, I was considering adding another ranking called "Raw Power" or something that adds the budgeted Haste + Healing together, as a way to balance against 10MM. I decided against it. Both represent power of healing without regard to mana or stamina, but combining them into a ranking would be mathematically tricky and would rely on the entire accumulated gear of the character.<br>

</div>OpenOffice doesn't do that. I built a Ruby application to do that. (Ruby is a lesser known scripting language, but if you've heard of Python or Perl, it's similar.) My application makes use of the WIN32OLE API that OpenOffice provides, using a class I built to easily create/modify spreadsheets. I also built a web scraper class to obtain Wowhead information. That information is passed to a class designed to represent and parse the information, then a third class maintains all of the parsers and executes the OpenOffice writer, using that to build the sheet.

</div>Maybe thats the formula from wowwiki but I use real items and there are some haste items with haste rating and almost no +heal loose. At least blizzard doesn't follow this formula.<br>
<br>
Haste Rating has also another benefit, it allows me to use downranked chain heals much better. My staple heals are CH2 and CH4 and you can get very good HPS with hasted CH2 "spam". And downranked CH can safe alot of mana, more than you can get with mp5 items.<br>
<br>
My first items with haste rating come from Zul Aman. I was a little bit disappointed about them, because they had no MP5. But most of them are serious upgrades to my old karazhan loots. So I used them and learned to love them. Mana was an issue sometimes at the beginning (pre 2.3), but this was forgotten with the watershield and mana spring totem change. Currently, I'm at 134 MP5 and its enough for everything after I add an flask, buff food and brilliant mana oil and some mana potions. There is no need for an shadow priest and I'm often in an pure meleegroup to support them.<br>
<br>
You will learn to love spellhaste if you use it. Other way its pure theory and you can do the math yourself if you really need them.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>That perspective is highly subjective. It has some merits, to be sure, but I would argue the following:<br>
Premise 1: In what situations would you downrank to CH 2-3? If you answered "only when people need a tiny bit of healing", you would be correct. You never downrank if there are significant holes in the health bars of your raid. When everyone is close to top off, then tossing out downranked heals is more efficient.<br>
Premise 2: During the middle of the fight, you cannot change most of your gear. That means, no change in haste rating mid-fight (except possibly to swap in <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33468" target="_blank">[Dark Blessing]</a>.)<br>
Premise 3: Extremely fast, efficient heals pad the healing meter, because you "get there first" and other healers overheal.<br>
Premise 4: If you spam max rank heals with spell haste, you will drain your mana pool very quickly.<br>
Conclusion: The only time you would want to wear haste explicitly for the purpose of spamming downranked heals is when you want to pad your healing meter, because you don't anticipate the raid being severely damaged. Otherwise, spell haste (stacked with +Healing) is helpful only for extremely short encounters.<br>

</div>That's what I mean. Take increased haste as an example. While your actual +Healing does not change, the value (and by that I mean the "worth") of that +Healing DOES change. However, the amount of that change (and the resulting value of +Heal) is dependent upon the rest of the heal/haste you have on. So, combining those two correctly is not mathematically possible without accounting for everything you have on, like you would for elemental.<br>

</div>Valid point, but I still argue that that involves arbitration. &gt;_&gt; Keep in mind that Ranking is purely for the purpose of sorting. If someone wants to stack heal/haste, it's very easy to pick out exactly which pieces they will need.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_645143"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->A point equivalent system is not optional for evaluating gear. It is an absolute nescessity. If you cannot agree on a point equivalence system, for a certain situation at least, you will never agree on which items to use. And since one is always better than the other (or else the other would be better), there *IS* a point equivalence system you could figure out.<br>
<br>
Such a system would obviously depend on a lot of factors people are not willing to take into account your gear, your party/raid buffs, your raid composition and how the fight you're up to works. Not taking those into account will lead to a faulty point system or to just not being able to agree on one, and thus not be able to agree on what items to use.<br>
<br>
Most people just ignore that fact and go with their fell and what they think is possibly better and do fine, and for a good reason - healing has lots of leeway. You almost always have mana left at the end of the fight if done right. You could almost always skip some heals and the raid would still live. If it wasn't like that fights would be impossible if you're just short of that 1-2 items or lag for 1 second. Of course the level of leeway vaires between fights, gear setups and party/raid compositions, a lot, but there's always some kind of leeway. Often people would claim that their gear choices are "good" or "fine" simply because it worked and they went through the fight with mana left and nobody dead and even topped the healing meters. But reality is that this doesn't mean you picked the right gear - it just means your gear was "good enough". It doesn't mean it was "good", or at least doesn't mean it was "the best".<br>
<br>
If you do take everything into account:<br>
<br>
Figure out what raid/party buffs you'll be running with and how long the fight will be (ignoring parts that are insignificant for healing, such as kael phase 1).<br>
<br>
Use these values with your gear to figure out how much healing you could do if you ended up needing to use all your mana. I assume you can always go oom if you spam max rank spells and therefore you can always do more healing with more mana IF (and that's a big IF) people actually need that healing and your HPS is high enough to provide it before they die or get healed by someone else.<br>
<br>
Use these values to figure out how much your max reliable burst is increased. When people are dying they don't care how much mana you had left, they care how much healing you can do on them in a short amount of time, and they don't care if you get lucky burst now if the next time they take damage you get unlucky and they die - so luck-based healing factors need not apply here. "use" trinkets may be applied (or partially applied) depending on the fight mechanics. Having that +300 healing on your NS may be only every 3 minutes but it could just as well save the raid, realiably, but not often - so its usefullness is dependant on the actual fight.<br>
<br>
Decide what you actually want (how valueable is HPS to you? How valueable is the amount of healing you can do using all your mana? How much would you give up of 1 in order to get more of the other?). Then you could actually build some stat equivalence system that will actually pick the gear that is best for the fight. <b>Doing any less than what I said here will just lead to some random point system that is quite meaningless most of the time unless its used by some people too lazy to do everything and have no clue what stats to pick, so averaging out or even guessing all those effects for them is better than just letting them pick gear that would be useless in all situations.</b><br>
<br>
<br>
<u><b>short version</b></u><br>
Can you compare items without a stat equivalence system? No. Can you make a stat equivalence system that will always be true? Definitely not. Can you make one that will be good enough for people that have no clue? Probably, but you should probably at least put some thought into all the factors above if you actaully try to come up with such a system. Doing silly things like ignoring HPS and only calculating HPM and total mana and multiplying the 2, or ignoring efficiency and calculating HPS, or worse, taking blizzard's itemization values and assuming they provide a good balance (!!) is not a good idea.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Your tone was rudely assertive and vitriolic, so I'm going to lay into you really hard, I hope you don't mind.  Let's start with this: your post has absolutely no value and is riddled with logical fallacies of a magnitude rivaling that of the national debt.<br>
<br>
An overview: you simultaneously argue subjectivity and "a point system". These ideas are mutually exclusive. A single value depicting the worth of a gear is inherently unable to subjectively account for a wide field of variables. Further details will be provided later in the post.<br>

</div>I have a few issues with your logic here. First, I disagree with the premise that "if you can't agree on a point equivalence system, you will never agree on which items to use." I can prove that false as follows: take any slot and any tier of gear. Approach any fight and classify it as regen-oriented or pure healing-oriented. If you had NO equivalence system whatsoever, you could still agree what gear to use, for the most part. The ONLY exception to this is weighing between haste and healing, which is the topic of ongoing discussion in this thread.<br>
<br>
You have to prove, in this post of yours, why an equivalence system is a necessity. By the end of my post, you will have no such proof. Read on. <br>

	</tbody></table>
</div>Let's look at the factors you named.<br>
1. Your gear - For resto shamans, the amount of value you get out of each stat does not mathematically change based on the rest of the gear you have equipped. (Other classes, like paladins and as of 2.4 both priests and druids, have their stat values change based on the rest of their gear.) Certainly, if you have a lot of regen you would want more healing instead of more regen, but this isn't a quantifiable value, because there is no way to objectively determine what the ratio between regen and mana should be. That ratio is highly subjective, debatable, situational, and susceptible to such a huge body of factors that only a rule of thumb could be (loosely) determined; such a rule of thumb lacks the precision necessary to incorporate into any point system that would be simple enough to understand.<br>
2. Party raid/buffs - see my comments on gear. The only applicable buff is the (improved) priest spirit buff, which turns 10% of your spirit into healing.<br>
3. Your raid compensation - Erm, no. Having two resto druids instead of one, or one priest instead of 3, has absolutely no effect on how you should value your gear. If you had a shadow priest, you wouldn't need as much regen, but if you get put in a raid with a shadow priest, just slap on your healing gear; you wouldn't go consult a spreadsheet.<br>
4. How the fight works - You do NOT design a point system that is <i>based on specific fights.</i> There's simply too many variables, and it's unbelievably subjective.<br>
<br>
So by your definition, ALL point systems are "faulty". I notice that you don't try to suggest how the factors you named should be incorporated. As I discussed earlier, this does not at all mean that people "can't agree on what items to use."<br>

</div>My issues with your grammar notwithstanding, I must once again point out your complete lack of specific details. Tuning your gear to a fight is an intuitive art that comes from experience and forehand knowledge, it has NOTHING to do with the "perfect point system" you so advocate. Yes, adjusting your gear so that you have "just enough" mana is an imperfect art, but that's something a spreadsheet can only <i>assist</i> with. Blindly adhering to a point system does not expose you to the subjective art of adjusting your gear based on your experience with certain fights.<br>

First of all, half of all that was simply stating the obvious. The rest of it is impossible to actually put into a formula. Please, tell me how you quantify:<br>
1. whether your "burst" healing is high enough<br>
2. whether a NS with a trinket will save the raid<br>

You're trying to quantify something that can only be accomplished with heuristics, and there simply isn't enough heuristic data available in a standardized format to adequately produce a formula.

				<div style="font-style:italic">Hey Skyhoof, just noticed something and thought you might want to make a slight change in the guide under the totemic focus section.<br>
<br>
<i>Totemic Focus: Reduces the cost of your totems by 25%. It provides a bigger benefit than Ancestral Knowledge. At worst, it will probably equate to giving you an extra 4.6 mp5 (Scenario 1). At best, it could give you the equivalent of 11.8 mp5 (Scenario 2).<br>
<br>
Scenario 2: You are in a melee group dropping Windfury, Strength of Earth, Healing stream and Searing Totem.<br>
Windfury: 325 mana<br>
Strength: 300 mana<br>
Healing: 95 mana<br>
Searing: 205 mana x 2<br>
Total: 5,650 mana during a 10 minute fight. The talent would save you 1,412 mana or 11.8 mp5</i><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Assuming this is a ten minute fight with 10 casts of searing wouldn't overall dps be higher if a fire Elemental were tossed in at some point? So removing 2X searing and adding one fire elemental @ 680 mana gives you 12.2 mp5.<br>
<br>
Also i think we can safely say that this talent is worth more in reality than on paper. I find myself (and would assume that  others do as well) refreshing totems often before the entire duration is up when i have GCD's to spare as a precautionary move. Given even a 5% margin of error you would need a whole new set refreshes adding another 925 mana or the regen up to 14.1. Add to this two uses of Mana tide and things look even better.<br>
<br>
By no means am i suggesting that this is a "must have" talent, but i do believe that you should bump the mp5 numbers that it returns upwards slightly as it does preform better than listed.<br>
<br>
I'm going to review some random WWS parces from t5-t6 and look at total totems cast and see if i can find a practical average value for this talent. Going to leave out t4  even though a longish Maiden fight for a new Kara guild might be the best bank for the buck with the talent.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>You make a good point that totems are often recast before expiring. I’ll redo the calculations based upon recasting them every 1.5 minutes (for Scenario 2). However, I prefer to keep the searing totem. If you compare the mana cost of the Fire Elemental versus the Searing Totem based upon using it every time the cooldown is available, the Fire Elemental costs 2.83 mp5 while the Searing Totem costs 17.08 mp5. Or during a 10-minute fight, you will spend 2870 mana on Searing totem but only 680 mana on your Fire Elemental.<br>

				Scenario 2: You are in a melee group dropping Windfury, Strength of Earth, Healing stream and Searing Totem. You drop your totems every 1.5 minutes, or 7 times during the fight.<br>
<br>
Windfury: 325 mana (2275)<br>
Strength: 300 mana (2100)<br>
Healing: 95 mana (665)<br>
Searing: 205 mana x 2 (2870)<br>
Total: 7,910  mana during a 10 minute fight. The talent would save you 1,977.5 mana or 16.5 mp5
			
		</td>

	</tbody></table>
</div>Please let me know what your WWS parse shows for how often you usually drop totems. A quick look at a BT WWS parse shows I drop them about every 1 minute, 45 seconds. However, I know that I drop them far more often on some other fights, such as Archimonde where I'm running all over the place and always want to have Tremor nearby. I will probably stick with 1.5 minutes for calculating a maximum benefit of Totemic Focus.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

The rest of it is impossible to actually put into a formula. Please, tell me how you quantify:<br>
1. whether your "burst" healing is high enough<br>
2. whether a NS with a trinket will save the raid<br>
3. whether HPS is valuable to you or not<br>
4. exactly how many casts of a spell you will need to put out during a variable length fight<br></div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>1.Actually I remember doing HPS calculations on the azglaor rain of fire to see if our melee could stay in.  Difficult? Perhaps there is a certain degree of randomness to it but you can still take averages.  Certainly not impossible.<br>
<br>
2. This really has too many factors to account for but I can certain see fights where this is desirable.<br>
<br>
3. Again you can calculate this or learn from experience.<br>
<br>
4. Exactly? No but you can take average of past fights or look at guilds with similar compositions to get some idea.<br>
<br>
Vitriolic diatribe aside, healing is not just based on item level. Its picking the right gear for every encounter.   Now obviously we don't all have every single piece of gear in our inventory but I change my gear for almost every fight.  Sometimes its a single trinket sometimes both sometimes its 4 or more pieces.  Your calculations of mana returned over 10 mins can be a useful stat, however the majority of fights are significantly shorter than 10 mins so really the ranking as it is of no use to me since my priorities don't align with your ilvl calculations.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

The four points enumerated were simply samples taken from his rant that I pointed out as next to impossible to put into the "point system" he wanted so badly (but refused to take any steps to calculate).

</div>Even inputting the length of the fight the ranks still have no relevance to my needs.  My point is there are far more variables than the length of fight and you just dismiss these as hard to quantify doesn't really help anyone with half a mind select gear. I saw the other posts but if I am looking at a sheet that ranks gear I want it to rank according to my needs not some other ranking which isn't what I want.  HPS and number of casts are not something I can spout off the top of my head but it is something I can examine with WWS and calculate HPS for burst situations. Perhaps my needs are different than others but the point is there is no way to make it suit my needs without rewritting it.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>If you want to, by all means do so. It would mean I could remove a large number of DEP/HEP checks and values, which will make it a bit easier for me to maintain stuff.<br>
<br>
Fairly sure I can adjust things so that when I make an update you'd be able to copy/paste the item lists over mine, and the healing calc over my ele calcs to fill in the same global variables.<br>
<br>
To be quite honest though, I've been tempted to hand over the reigns of the speadsheets, and I don't think I'll have the time to devote to them anymore (combination of Work, Raiding, and getting the Wiki entries written), so I might ask if anyone wants to handle the Elemental side soon.<br>
<br>
Quick Edit: I think the "standard" of comparison for restoration should be how much extra healing results from adding 1 of the desired stat, normalised so that heal = 1. Half of the trouble at the moment is that while higher ilvl usually equals better item, it's not always the case (how many of us wanted Mag's shield over the T6 equivs?) Could even take the current ShamStats calculations, extend them all to look at time period X, and see what the overall effect is for the timeframe, then convert it down to a 5 second basis.<br>
<br>
Heck, we could even remove the gear entirely, and just calculate "EP" values to plug into lootrank or something.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Err. If my gut is a "stat equivalence system", then yes. I've never used any system to try to break my healing set into math, because it's not static like DPS. I've noticed how my mana usage has been though T5 and T6 content, found my regular regen demand. Opted for mostly +heal and a little haste for the rest of the budget. My upgrades have usually been more healing(and any other non-vital stat) at the cost of mp5. But never to cut into regen deep.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Doesn't matter. You will never gear for stam(well, not while in T6 gear or if demands are bumped heavily during SW), int or spirit. You get those if you want them or not. You will always end up with a manapool of 10k or more and that is enough. Int can be given a tiny, tiny value compared to "real" healing stats as it gives a little +dmg/heal, mana from MTT and crit. The others are as useless in a healing optimization spreadsheet as in the enhance shaman setup.</div>

</div><br>
And that's the exact point. Other gear (T4/5/6 etc) has stamina as part of it's item budget. There are haste items that don't. Quid pro quo. You gain heal and haste at the cost of stamina, not haste at the cost of heal.<br>
<br>
On a note more relavent to the discussion on the spreadsheets.<br>
I use RatingBuster in game to get all the info i need when a new item drops. I can compare all i want out of game, but if it hasn't droppped and i don't have it, there is no use pining over it. I know which pieces need an upgrade, i know whether or not i need more mana, healing, haste etc.<br>
At the moment, i value Bastion of Light over Enamelled Disc of Mojo. Primarily because i don't have enough required stamina and overall it's the better shield FOR ME (that and it has more +healing). Once i get the remaining pieces i want with the stamina that is required, then maybe i'll change. Until that point though, there's nothing i can do about it.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

However, I prefer to keep the searing totem. If you compare the mana cost of the Fire Elemental versus the Searing Totem based upon using it every time the cooldown is available, the Fire Elemental costs 2.83 mp5 while the Searing Totem costs 17.08 mp5. Or during a 10-minute fight, you will spend 2870 mana on Searing totem but only 680 mana on your Fire Elemental.</div>

		<div id="post_message_645626"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Hmm. Tell you what. Give me a few days, and I'll incorporate a lot of Bink's stuff into my spreadsheet. Let's see if I can come up with a sheet that Bink, Skyhoof and I are all happy with. That way, Bink can stop maintaining a resto version. If it works well, I'll expand the scope of the sheet (with another version) to include elemental. Sound fair?<br>
<br>
I'm also going to use a parsing algorithm to load heuristics data from successful boss kills that are posted on WWS. I'll build a Ruby on Rails application to allow anyone to upload said heuristics data so that we can get a good cross-section on what spells get cast by shamans during certain fights. That should help us come up with a more accurate weighting system. PLEASE NOTE that this will take (at minimum!) 3-5 weeks AFTER I get the regular spreadsheet automated. Web applications are always tricky, and I'm not 100% proficient in basic Rails applications yet.<br>
<br>
There are a couple of non-spreadsheet enhancements I am considering (ALL OF WHICH will only function with OpenOffice, and would require Ruby to be installed):<br>
 - I could develop a simple addon to pull all currently-owned gear out of your inventory and bank and adjust the spreadsheet based on what you do or don't have.<br>
 - I could develop a script that will automatically set up ItemRack sets and AtlasLoot wishlist entries based on decisions you make in the spreadsheet.<br>
 - I could develop a script that will calculate your DPS (elemental) or HPS (resto) for a given number of minutes and make recommendations. (This might require heuristics data to be more useful.)<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

But if you have 'enough' MP5, they why not boost hps instead. I could happily lose 100MP5 whilst casting when fully raid buffed (if in a SP group) and replace that with Haste. As it happens, the pieces i have give me 110 hr, at the loss of about 20 MP5 (at the very most) about 200 hit points and approximately the same plus heal...which hardly breaks the bank, but does increase my hps by around 110, and that's on a 100%/50%/10% split for chain heal.<br>
Or i could choose to downrank by 1, stay at the same hps as the unhasted higher rank, and keep it going for longer, even with a 100mp5 loss.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Your point is only correct in the sense of a technicality. Yes, there are THREE healing items worth mentioning that have haste in their budget and no stamina in their budget. Any person trying to make a cohesive argument would list those three explicitly. Your statement gives the implication that a significant body of gear that has haste and no stamina, which is horribly incorrect, to the tune of fifty-four to five.

				<div style="font-style:italic">I'm also going to use a parsing algorithm to load heuristics data from successful boss kills that are posted on WWS. I'll build a Ruby on Rails application to allow anyone to upload said heuristics data so that we can get a good cross-section on what spells get cast by shamans during certain fights. That should help us come up with a more accurate weighting system. PLEASE NOTE that this will take (at minimum!) 3-5 weeks AFTER I get the regular spreadsheet automated. Web applications are always tricky, and I'm not 100% proficient in basic Rails applications yet.</div>

</div>I'm not sure this is worth the time and effort. With Shamstats, I set my spell rotation to 90% chainheal, 5% LHW and 5% Healing Wave. Any parse of shaman healing in WWS is going to show that we mainly cast Chain Heal. Instead of trying to come up with your own rating system, I would suggest using the values that Binkenstein has calculated in Shamstats or the ones I give in this post. Plus, it would be important for users to be able to enter their own values. <br>

</div>Basically, here is what we want to know. What gear will give a shaman maximum HPS without going OOM for a fight of x duration with y buffs, talents and gear, etc. We basically would like you to further develop your concept of 10MM. Shamstats is pretty close to being able to do this (I think). Shamstats already allows you to enter talents and buffs, including whether you have a shadow priest. HPS alone would be a rather meaningless stat for gear comparison.</div>

		<div id="post_message_645932">Wish list is a new addition to AtlasLoot. I'm just pulling something off the top of my head, that's all. I don't know how popular it will be, but basically, the idea I'm thinking is this (based on how I marked up my own comparison sheet):<br>
1. Items that the user <b>has</b> will be formatted as "outline"<br>
2. Items the user <b>wants</b> he should mark in bold.<br>
Based on the sets in some control tab (I'm working on it), ItemRack sets would be generated using a Ruby script. Based on the items bolded, Wishlist entries would be created. These are just preliminary thoughts.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I'm hashing out a new spreadsheet. I have an exam Thursday and a comp sci project due Friday, as well as errands I have to run amidst classes this week, so I can't give a good estimate of how long this will take. Hopefully I'll have something concrete by this weekend.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">But if you have 'enough' MP5, they why not boost hps instead. I could happily lose 100MP5 whilst casting when fully raid buffed (if in a SP group) and replace that with Haste. As it happens, the pieces i have give me 110 hr, at the loss of about 20 MP5 (at the very most) about 200 hit points and approximately the same plus heal...which hardly breaks the bank, but does increase my hps by around 110, and that's on a 100%/50%/10% split for chain heal.<br>
Or i could choose to downrank by 1, stay at the same hps as the unhasted higher rank, and keep it going for longer, even with a 100mp5 loss.</div>

	</tbody></table>
</div>Listen; You have to start backing your claims with some math. For all I know, all you do is pull these numbers out of a hat. What's your usual overhealing percentage? What's your hp buffed at(if those 200 stam are useless), what's your HPS needs? What is your regen and your mana usage? Etc.<br>
<br>
Those 110 haste is currently:<br>
New Casting Time = Base Casting Time / (1 + (Spell Haste Rating/1570))<br>
2.5/(1+(110/1570)) = 2.34<br>
<br>
In a 10 minute window, you will have cast 256 CHs, compare to 240 with no haste. <br>
<br>
Rank 5 CH: 826 to 942 =884 on average. Coefficient is 2.5/3.5. Paperdoll has 2k +heal.<br>
<br>
A simulated cast: (coefficient*heal + base) * Improved Chain Heal * (100%+50%+25%)<br>
(2.5/3.5*2000+884)*1.2*1.75 = 4856.40<br>
<br>
Say you bring your 110 haste which is 241.76 +heal in pure item budget.<br>
<br>
(2.5/3.5*2241.76+884)*1.2*1.75 = 5219.04<br>
<br>
Hasted:<br>
4856.40 * 256 = 1 243 238.40<br>
Non-hasted: <br>
5219.04 * 240 = 1 252 569.60<br>
<br>
Mp5 is the same in those two cases, but you cast 16 more rank 5 CHs, resulting in 540*0.90*0.95*16 = 7387.20 extra mana spent. This is 7387.20/(10*60/5) = 61.56 mp5. And this for less healed.</div>

		<div id="post_message_646427">Your'e completely misunderstanding my point. Of course it's not possible to make a perfect system, hence it's not possible to agree on what gear would be the best for every fight. However if you do the math yourself, you can at least average the factors out in a way that will give you maximum chance to succeed on a fight. You can go more accurate or you can do it more roughly. However completely ignoring some qualities of stats that *will* be useful in at least some fights/setups/etc and then making a point value is just silly. You cannot compare mana efficiency to HPS unless you know what kind of fight you're coming up against and what raid/party you'll have. Even if you do know, it's still hard to compare, but not comparing at all when picking your gear is silly.<br>
<br>
Most point systems I've seen so far are either based on pure itemization value (which doesn't take all these factors into account as blizzard had never been amazing theorycrafters), based on pure HPS or based on pure efficiency increase.<br>
<br>
The reason you cannot compare items properly without a point system is that eventually you will always be choosing stat tradeoffs. Be it 10 healing vs 3 mp5, 20 haste vs 30 int, or whatever. Yes that point system would be incredibly complicated and never possible to do accurately, but that only means you will never be able to completely agree which items are better. And I'm not talking about a fixed point system, I'm talking about a varaible point system, one that gives each item a different value for every fight/setup.<br>
<br>
<b>You must be asking - what can I do with this information in practice?</b><br>
Well the best you can do that I can think of to actually compare items, is to make a spreadsheet that would include:<br>
1. User configureable setups - starting from current gear and raid/party buffs, and over to how much he evaluates HPS vs efficiency for the fight he's checking which gear is best for.<br>
2. Calculate max burst HPS - again allowing configureable numbers that will affect how important you find different "kinds" of burst - mostly how much you benefit from cooldown-based bursts VS static . For example, assuming you're still learning those fights, for azgalor cooldowns would be better as you can pop them when you resist the silence, but kael phase 2/3 you will need to do lots of healing over a longer time before you go back into easy(er)-mode healing of phase 4/5.<br>
3. Calculate how much healing you can do if you use all your mana. This will of course greatly depend on the spells you use for the fight, but we're assuming you have already decided what is the best way to actually heal and only trying to compare gear, so the spell ratio would be user-entered. Possibly even add an "average HPS requirement" (which wouldn't be the minimum to keep the raid alive, but the maximum amount of healing you can do based on damage people take) to calculate the effectiveness of downraking more when having higher HPS.<br>
4. Take all those user-entered factors into account and calculate the "point system".<br>
<br>
Making this kind of spreadsheet is actually very practical. What's hard is to actually put the "user-configureable" stuff in it. However such a thing would at least allow you to see what things have a big effect on the "point system" and what things don't. You can also estimate the margin of error in your input and see how much error that adds to the "point system". When making an imperfect/roudned system it's good to know how much "off" it could be. You could even let the spreadsheet do the "error" calcuation itself.<br>
<br>
So yes, comparing items perfectly is difficult to impossible, but making a point system that will tell you how good items are in a way (at least) better than anything done so far is very possible and practical, and will give much better information about the value of stats than just trying to create a "fixed" point system or calculate based on only 1 aspect of healing. The "best" spreadsheets seem to stick with pure "how much healing I can do until I go oom" which just isn't enough especially when they ignore the added HPS of downranking so even what they calculate actually fails.</div>

PS: If you have HPS demands which are high, you would probably be very interested in the proc from CSoK. On a cluster-fsck fight like the last stage of Anger, it can up the landed heal for ~600 hp.</div>

<br>
On Leotheras: Searing totems must be lifted before demon phase transition. Aggro gain by the demon tank is slowed with searing down lowering raid damage.<br>
<br>
On Morogrim: Grace of air dropped for the MT really helps for the extra dodge. Moro hits like a truck. Also amplify magic on the tanks. 92-95% of Moro's damage is physical and the amp helps save healers mana over the long run.</div>

</div>It does cost, but then, i wouldn't use it if i couldn't afford the mana cost - i.e. when not in a SP group; that's when putting on more +heal and mp5 is a necessity.<br>
<br>
Btw, you'd need 880 MP5 (whilst casting) to sustain a 10minute fight of spamming R5 chain heal. (with totem of living water and approx 13500 mana) using approx 125715 mana in total.<br>
<br>
CSoK i'd take over Dark Blessing anyway, even in a hasted set. It's far too good imo to not use.</div>

I suspect that when learning new bosses more mana regen is going to be very important, but I would still like to know how the MSD performs in Sunwell. Are there any periods of extreme burst raid or tank damage?

</div>Chill out, Grays. Galzohar was brain storming some ideas on what resto shaman would find helpful in a spreadsheet. We like those sort of posts in this thread. We appreciate having someone like you who can also craft spreadsheets to turn our ideas into reality. We know the actual formulas are not easy to create. <br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">In the raiding sections on what works for bosses I have found these to help:<br>
<br>
On Leotheras: Searing totems must be lifted before demon phase transition. Aggro gain by the demon tank is slowed with searing down lowering raid damage.<br>
<br>
On Morogrim: Grace of air dropped for the MT really helps for the extra dodge. Moro hits like a truck. Also amplify magic on the tanks. 92-95% of Moro's damage is physical and the amp helps save healers mana over the long run.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I'm interested in this as well, was going to socket my meta with an IED, but decided on a MSD for the exact reasons above. Even with the change (320 haste for 6 seconds, 15% proc chance right?) it seems much more valuable for shamans in theory than 12 int and between 5-10 mana/5 depending on whats being cast.</div>

</div>Also, MSD still has a 45 second cooldown. <br>
<br>
Making any meaningful comparison between the two meta gems is difficult without some hard numbers on how often IED procs. I had been observing 15-20 mp5 but a look at some recent WWS shows it’s providing 10-15 mp5. Anyone have better data?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Najentus (4:29): 600 mana = 11.1 mp5<br>
Bloodboil (7:37): 1500 mana = 16.7 mp5<br>
Magtheridon (7:19) 1200 mana = 13.8 mp5<br>
Mother Sharaz attempt (3:27) 600 mana = 14.3 mp5<br>
Mother Sharaz attempt (2:49) 600 mana = 17.6 mp5<br>

</div>I found this a little problematic last night on Leo, but not in terms of our demon tank having a hard time picking him up.  If our demon tank doesn't have aggro as soon as he shifts AND people are standing around the searing totem, then it is likely that they will all get him once by him.  Maybe twice if your warlock is slow on aggro pickup.  We only ever had one flame blast on a group because of this however.  I found that the overall benefit of keeping Searing Totem down (increased DPS in demon phase and making sure the tank can easily pick him back up upon shift) more than compenstated for the small damage that people took from the one blast he hit them with.</div>

</div>For the data I posted, I used the entire length of the fight, not the time I spent healing. Here are the results using your format. However, it appears that WWS rounds your time spent healing, making it fairly inaccurate in some cases.<br>

It’s probably best to chose fights that we spend nearly 100% of our time healing. Keep in mind that IED will proc off any spell, such as refreshing water shield, casting totems, etc. So it could proc even if you're not healing.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Unfortunately it sometimes happens that that DoT doesn't tick off in time before the Searing Totem ticks and the totem gets a second of aggro.

First, I thought Relics were applied <u>before</u> set bonuses. So the Tier 6 set bonus shouldn’t impact the relic.<br>

Second, Rank 1 HW costs 23.75 mana after talents. The totem of the Maelstrom allows you to cast this for free since it reduces the cost by 24 mana. This would imply that the totem is applied after talents.</div>

</div>A few pages back there was discussion on whether a shamans fire totems aggro gets reset on a full aggro reset. I searched high and low and cannot find a definitive answer to that question. What I do know is that a druid tank with a hunters MD and his own aggro will not out aggro a searing totem at Leo's switch to human form. Leo goes and swats the totem then goes for second highest aggro, the druid tank. This leads me to believe totems aggro does not reset.<br>
<br>
In demon form the mechanics are slightly different.  Demon Leo uses only one form of damage, Chaos Blast, which is a aoe based attack. Unlike the human form he cannot kill the totem (totems are immune to aoe effects). As such what I have noticed is a loss to the dps of at least one tick and sometimes 2 while the lock pushes out searing pains until he out aggros the totem. Most of this fights dps comes from demon form so any lost time is important here.<br>
<br>
The time loss is small so a end game guild with T6 dps may not be bothered by the searing because they know how to kill Leo quickly. Beginning guilds will need all the help they can get to beat the enrage and that tick or two maybe the difference. This fight is very easy on healers so the extra mana used to reset the totems is never a problem.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I asked our druid MT in full t6 if he ever was out aggroed by a searing totem and he said it i wasn't a problem if he timed it right.   His thinking was that  the searing totem it getting initial aggro simplydue to it constantly hitting the mob so it frequently gets the first hit after an aggro reset.  He said if he timed it right the mob would never go for the totem.  So I think the jury is still out about totem aggro.   <br>
<br>
<br>
Also if you placed the searing along the same vector as the lock I don't see why it would be any dps loss.  Its been awhile since I did the fight but I never remember any issues with it.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Might be just us but we do not dps on Demon Leo till the lock has aggro. Dps early and lock gets a searing pain resist and  dps dies fast. Checked the top end guilds WWS for Leo, even their locks get searing pain resisted. Will test it out tonight and see if vector works.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

This means, if the Searing totem has done a total of 2k damage before the aggro reset (after a whirlwind of Leotheras for example), the totem keeps its 2k aggro while all players have 0 aggro. this obviously means, that Leotheras will head for the searing totem until a tank has built up more than 2.2k aggro or the totem was destroyed.<br>

		<div id="post_message_650555"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->First, let me say I've probably read this thread about 100 times and still haven't been able to soak the wealth of awesome information in that is posted here.  You have a great resource for anyone that seriously wants to make sure they are wringing the most potential from their resto shaman.<br>
<br>
My guild is currently progressing into SSC / TK and this site has definitely given me that last extra edge to make sure I'm performing to my most potential.  I will say that the equip macros alone before casting let me wring another 1-2% on my healing alone it feels like, I never even thought about that something as simple as that.<br>
<br>
With all the wealth of information here I'm not even sure what I could add, nothing groundbreaking for sure.<br>
<br>
The only extra tip I could add after re-reading the awesome posts here that I didn't see was a trick we learned while fighting Netherspit on accident (I'm sure its pretty widespread knowledge, but didn't see it in the original post with regards to things resto shaman can do in specific encounters).<br>
<br>
Netherspite:<br>
From what I've seen, during banish phase most guilds leave a tank in and the rest of the people gather underneath NS or behind her and bandage / pot, whatever.  However, If you leave a searing totem in front of NS and call no DOTS about 15sec prior to the banish, the searing totem will hold 100% of the NS's aggro and will not take AOE damage from NS.  This allows the whole raid (including tank) to bandage and make fun of the gnomes in raid.  Make sure the tank is ready to pickup aggro upon the completion of banish.<br>
<br>
Again this isn't groundbreaking and NS isn't really a hard fight once you get the communication down, just my 2 copper on adding a bit of value to a site that has provided so much to me.<br>
<br>
Thanks again from the silent majority for your efforts here on this site.<br>
<br>
We just brought mags down as we are transitioning a bit backwards from most guild through the content i guess...FYI earthbind helps alot when the infernals are running around, however earthbind if dropped before the encounter starts, will start it as it counts as an aoe...doh...bad shammy...bad.<br>
<br>
If you're ever in the neighborhood on Hellscream and need a healer or a crappy alt prot warrior let me know.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
First I wanted to thank everyone who contributes to this thread.  I started getting rushed into my guild because they needed a Restoration Shaman and this thread really helped me get up to speed with what I was supposed to be doing.<br>
<br>
I also read the Enhancement thread and they have been talking about the new changes to Totems in 2.4 in which a macro is added which will allow you to selectively destroy totems (and get mana back as if you were casting Totemic Recall).  I thought I would mention it since not everyone necessarily reads the other threads and I hadn't seen it mentioned here.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Hi.  <br>
<br>
First I wanted to thank everyone who contributes to this thread.  I started getting rushed into my guild because they needed a Restoration Shaman and this thread really helped me get up to speed with what I was supposed to be doing.<br>
<br>
I also read the Enhancement thread and they have been talking about the new changes to Totems in 2.4 in which a macro is added which will allow you to selectively destroy totems (and get mana back as if you were casting Totemic Recall).  I thought I would mention it since not everyone necessarily reads the other threads and I hadn't seen it mentioned here.<br>

If I read your post correctly, the statement of your tank in no way questions the theory of totems not being affected by an aggro reset. I am guessing that he simply use a high aggro attack in order to out aggro the totem instantly. If he only uses a normal attack, then it is quite possible the totem will still have aggro if it has been up for a significant amount of time before the aggro reset.<br>
<br>
So far I have not seem anything happen that has seriously challenged my theory that totems are not affected by aggro resets.<br>

</div>Yes that was one possibility. I'd be curious if any tanks can test this on a fight with aggro wipes.  In my experiences I never had a tank only white attack after a aggro wipe so I have not seen evidence conclusively one way or the other.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_651606"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->First and foremost, I would like to apologize for taking this discussion in a new direction but I recently had an interesting thought with regard to Water Shield. Limited testing performed in game of this ability seems to suggest as soon as Water Shield is cast, 50 mana is instantly restored to the caster; with an additional 50 restored every 5 seconds thereafter. Now, suppose this testing is true and one refreshes Water Shield every time the global cooldown has "cooled down". In a lag free environment, it would be possible to restore 150 mana in the the 5 second period instead of 50 with 0.5 seconds to spare.<br>
<br>
1.5 * 3 = 4,5<br>
3 * 50 = 150<br>
<br>
Obviously, this relies on the instant tic theory of Water Shield to be true which very well may be false. However, if true, it could prove quite useful in situations where little healing is required and a Shaman may comfortably sit in the GCD for a few seconds to regain some extra mana. As Water Shield costs nothing, a Shaman could do this and still remain outside the 5 second rule.<br>
<br>
EDIT: Further testing has proven this theory wrong and therefore this post is rendered useless. Apologies for taking up space.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Does anyone have any experience with the <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=25893" target="_blank">[Mystical Skyfire Diamond]</a> and the Sunwell encounters on the PTR? As we know there have been some changes made to the MSD on the PTR, and I would like to know if anyone has raided Sunwell there and could share their experience with the meta. <br>
<br>
As it stands currently I use the MSD in my T6 helm, and I recently picked up a 2nd Tier 6 Helm token and I'm debating whether or not I should buy another Resto helm to put in an IED or just get an Elemental helm for fun. In my experiences through Black Temple I have come to the conclusion that the MSD is by far the better gem for all encounters but the Illidari Council. This is because we have everything on farm status now and bosses drop a lot faster than I can run OOM with my mana regen from elsewhere. <br>
<br>
I suspect that when learning new bosses more mana regen is going to be very important, but I would still like to know how the MSD performs in Sunwell. Are there any periods of extreme burst raid or tank damage? Are any of the bosses "skinny" enough for Chain Heal to bounce from tank to melee (in which case it may be a good idea to assign a Resto Shaman to heal the tank)? Information like this would be greatly appreciated.</div>

	</tbody></table>
</div>I have some experience with this meta on the ptr. The actual haste number eludes me, but I'll edit this post once I can log the PTR (if anyone remembers the exact number, feel free Edit:320).<br>
<br>
<br>
For the record, the change is from Next spell cast is cast in half time (consumes the charge) to your spells cast faster (not consumed and 4(?) second charge). It's therefore possible to cast two chain healswith one skyfire proc, although currently with PTR lag it can be a bit tricky. I *think* my chain heal went from 2.4 sec&gt;2.1, again I can't remember for sure and I will omit any erronous figures once I can log ptr again.<br>
<br>
I've only tried the first two bosses. At least on kaelcgos, the extra haste can be really nice. The boss(es) can do some nasty chain combo specials that can leave multiple people very low on health, and this is where fast multi-target heals are useful.<br>
<br>
Second boss I only tried once, is less raid damage orientated and more hitting-your-tank-extremely-hard orientated and I would guess with the spam healing need that earthstorm diamond would be more suited as it appears to be mana intensive.<br>
<br>
Both bosses are huge so there is very little chain healing bouncing off the tank. I think that if people get their spacing right and don't do anything stupid to get alot of damage, that you generally won't <i>need</i>, skyfires proc for raidwide damage. Kalecgos and the demon can have significant burst (think morogrim on your first attempts), and Brut has insane burst, so choose what you prefer.<br>
<br>
My own decision at this time is to change to ISD and put MSD in a hasted (considering the timer on its charge) set such as Skyhoof suggested; <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=34402" target="_blank">[Shroud of Chieftain Ner'zhul]</a> would be really nice for it. ISD is a surefire safe choice for me as additional mana is always added to your pool during your fight to be used at a later stage, whilst the MSD can proc at odd and uneeded times and is on a short timer.<br>
<br>
Hope this helped.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

From what I've seen, during banish phase most guilds leave a tank in and the rest of the people gather underneath NS or behind her and bandage / pot, whatever.  However, If you leave a searing totem in front of NS and call no DOTS about 15sec prior to the banish, the searing totem will hold 100% of the NS's aggro and will not take AOE damage from NS.  This allows the whole raid (including tank) to bandage and make fun of the gnomes in raid.  Make sure the tank is ready to pickup aggro upon the completion of banish.<br>
<br>
Again this isn't groundbreaking and NS isn't really a hard fight once you get the communication down, just my 2 copper on adding a bit of value to a site that has provided so much to me.</div>

</div>We did a Kara badge run this weekend and gave this strategy a try. The strategy will work as long as no one attacks Netherspite during the banish phase. If they don't stop their attack, they will quickly out-aggro the Searing Totem. So if your guild's normal strategy is to do no DPS while a tank stands in front of NS, a searing totem would be a great improvement.<br>
<br>
However, we like to hit things in my guild. Therefore, for us, it's better to continue DPS during the banish and run through NS when he does the breath.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

You lose Natures Blessing which now means your Rank 5 Chains heals hit at a Rank 4 level. This at a cost of 100 or so extra mana per heal. You gained 43 mana/5 but lost the 200/5 if you down ranked your chains. You also lose the extra threat your ES does for the tank which ups his aggro allowing DPS to work harder. The ES also helps on spikes as a quasi hot.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
"Evidence" for him to not reset aggro at the start of the banish phase:<br>
1. If you notice he still melees (or tries to melee if out of range) the highest person on threat during banish phase. You will often not notice that because he moves rediculessly slow and that person will usually be the ranged DPSer that was in the blue beam. If the ranged DPSer will stand in melee when he's highest on threat, netherspite can and will kill him between netherbreaths.<br>
2. It's always that person that didn't stop dps/DoTs that gets aggro when he unbanishes, not a person that I generally trust to have good dps.<br>

</div>The Searing Totem appears to be the one object in the game not affected by aggro resets. We do not know whether the effect is intended or a bug that has existed since the creation of the game. After the banish phase ends, Netherspite will remain aggroed on the Searing Totem, giving your tank time to pick him up before the portals reappear.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">"Evidence" for him to not reset aggro at the start of the banish phase:<br>
1. If you notice he still melees (or tries to melee if out of range) the highest person on threat during banish phase. You will often not notice that because he moves rediculessly slow and that person will usually be the ranged DPSer that was in the blue beam. If the ranged DPSer will stand in melee when he's highest on threat, netherspite can and will kill him between netherbreaths.<br>
2. It's always that person that didn't stop dps/DoTs that gets aggro when he unbanishes, not a person that I generally trust to have good dps.<br>

Next kara pug I run I'm definitely trying a searing totem.</div>

</div>There is evidence that the start of the banish phase is not a complete aggro wipe. I believe anyone who was standing in a beam has their aggro reset. However, it would be very easy for the person who took the blue beam to get to the top of the list. They will still have the damage buff for 10 seconds.<br>
<br>
EDIT: I realized that I didn't include my favorite shaman trick with Netherspite.<br>

Healing Stream: Drop at the end of the portal phase while you still have the +healing buff from the green beam. <br>

</div>This benefit is really marginal. Most of the time if you start healing a person when he will not survive long enough for a 2.5 second cast, you, as a healer, really did something wrong. A really important lesson to learn while working to become a good healer is to be able to recognize who *will* become damage.<br>
<br>
Eg. on Illidari Council you will recognize someone getting hit by the rogue before most of the damage is dealt by the deadly poison debuff. Or you can see who will be hit by the priests Holy Fire variant due to the fact the priest will target him while casting the spell. It is stuff like this, that you'll need to recognize and learn to emphasize. Debuffs and Aggro will tell you alot about who will soon be dealt damage. Beeing able to see that helps you alot more than 0.2 seconds casttime off of your chainheal.<br>
<br>
That said of course spellhaste will make you cast your spells faster and might safe one or two lifes, however, it will hardly help if your reaction time is worse than that of loaded truck at full speed.<br>
<br>
My personal opinion is you should not gear for spellhaste because your heals will land a few parts of a second earlier. I'd only gear for haste on fights where I need to max my heal throughput. However, some of the spellhaste gear you can get might even be worth considering on a not "maxed healoutput"-fight, eg the heroic badges girdle or the BT trash rings. They'd be at least allright without the spellhaste, but it's a nice bonus and might safe that person once in a while.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Yes, but the problem is not in my gear atm. The problem is in gear from SSC/TK which improving healing and reduces stamina. For example, <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=29976" target="_blank">[Worldstorm Gauntlets]</a> from Solarian and <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=29032" target="_blank">[Cyclone Gloves]</a> from T4. As you can see, Worldstorm Gauntlents have less stamina than Cyclone Gloves. This means -70 hp to me only from gloves. I know that i can easily set gauntlents with stamina gem and even doing this gauntlents would be improvement for me. But not all T5 related gear have gem slots and i am in doubt about such "improvement" (stamina instead of healing/mp5 gem). Is 7k hp unbuffed would be good for TK/SSC encounters?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>It’s not ideal. However, it’s fairly easy for a shaman to get 7.5k health unbuffed. <br>
<br>
Your shield currently has no enchant so if you are concerned about hp put +18 stamina on it.<br>
Your boots currently have the Vitality enchant. Use Boar’s speed with its +9 stamina and run speed boost.<br>
<br>
Those changes alone would increase your health by 270. <br>
<br>
Also, you have a very nice neck and ring. Unfortunately, one reason they are so good for healing is that they lack stamina. There are many alternatives available with stamina. Use them on encounters where you need more hit points. <br>
<br>
And please read the section on gem choices. Some of your choices make my eyes water.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I've been raiding as a T4 geared shaman in a T6 guild for some weeks and I can't stress how valuable my MSD is to my healing.  Mana is cheap and easy to come by between Water shield, shadow priests, and pots, but no amount of mana is going to keep my group up on Gurtogg when I'm spamming Chain heal 5  and it's only hitting for 3k on the first bump.  I rely on those procs (and emergency NS's) to be able to do my job in a place I'm undergeared for.  That half-casted Chain heal makes up for the lack of healing on the 5 before it, you know?<br>
<br>
I don't really understand the difficulty in timing people mention.  I chain cast- there's rarely a GCD I am not using, and I'm very confident at predicting roughly when my MSD will proc.  The first proc is 1-4 casts (roughly) and usually a waste.  After that it's always up right when I'm falling behind on raid healing, and I've kept many many raid members alive solely because of it.  Hell even tank healing, having 2 back to back HW's land that fast is something that saves raids.<br>
<br>
Of course there are wasted procs, and it isn't saving a raid every fight.  It does so enough however that I've honestly never considered a helm with no meta because it's such an important proc to my playstyle.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I think a portion of the value could be calculated as spirit based regen as haste puts you back outside the five second rule (5SR) sooner. This will only improve come 2.4 when haste lowers the global cool down (GCD), but you can approximate a effect haste has on regen. <br>

Now, no matter what this is going to be a very small number as most of us spend the majority of our time inside the 5SR. Under current conditions assume you end every cast sequence with a chain heal, determine the number of times you enter the 5SR multiply that by the cast time reduction from haste and then figure out the extra regen. <br>
<br>
Now granted this will only be the extreme upper end value of this regen, but one you can figure out none the less. Now this number is still going to be small and in fact on most fights if this resulted in significant regen, you're probably doing something wrong.<br>
<br>
Please note I'm not saying staking spirit and haste is a good idea, but they are somewhat complementary.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_656887"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Ok, a subject that was touched on in this thread was spell crit. Seeing as though our main spell used has an individual chance to crit, what is the chance per each cast of CH for the initial heal, or subsequent jumps to crit?<br>
<br>
My basic thinking, is by stacking a bit more spell crit that i can throught crit's improve the effectiveness of chain heal's subsequent jumps, outside of using T2 ... or a challenge for you number crunchers, at what point will spell crit provide an equal benefit to 3pce T2?<br>
<br>
I'm thinking mainly for heavy dmg fights such as BB, RoS 3 and Naj  where the sheer amount of raid dmg negates the issue of overheal.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>That still has one of the problems some (or most, no idea) paladins have with gearing/gemming for crit. Is it wise to rely on a dice roll to keep people alive?

				<div style="font-style:italic">First, I have to question if you actually read the main post.<br>
<br>
It’s not ideal. However, it’s fairly easy for a shaman to get 7.5k health unbuffed. <br>
<br>
Your shield currently has no enchant so if you are concerned about hp put +18 stamina on it.<br>
Your boots currently have the Vitality enchant. Use Boar’s speed with its +9 stamina and run speed boost.<br>
<br>
Those changes alone would increase your health by 270. <br>
<br>
Also, you have a very nice neck and ring. Unfortunately, one reason they are so good for healing is that they lack stamina. There are many alternatives available with stamina. Use them on encounters where you need more hit points. <br>
<br>
And please read the section on gem choices. Some of your choices make my eyes water.</div>

Yes, ive read main post. The problem is i am now have the 7.5k hp unbuffed. So, as you can see, if i will start to lowering my hp i will not be in range you've posted. But i think you right with the shield. Stamina enchant on it should help abit. About Vitality... i am not sure i am viable to change it to Boar's Speed. I dont have personal SP in raid, so the mana regen is very important for me.<br>

4mp5 from Vitality is hardly worth worrying about even without a Shadow Priest. 480 mana returned over a 10 minute fight. Just downrank to CH4. 5 of those will save you that 480 mana.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

+Heal - 2200<br>
MP5 whilst casting 300<br>
Spell crit - 10% (not including 5% from talents)<br>
Mana - 13000<br>
<br>
Without a shadow priest you'd be able to spam CH5 for approx 92s before going OOM.(with totem of living water)<br>
<br>
6mp5 would not change that as you'd only gain 110 mana back in that time. Not enough for another CH5 cast.<br>
<br>
Add 6.6 intellect (BoK)<br>
Spell crit 10.08 %<br>
+Heal 2202.2<br>
Mana 13099<br>
<br>
You'd still last 92s, however, the HPM would increase by 0.01 and approx 1hps better. (this with a 100/50/10 hit split)Doesn't sound alot, but for me, i don't miss the mp5 and would rather have the extra stats. <br>
<br>
Would this improve over a 10 minute fight? The extra heal and crit directly affects the amount of healing done and if you get a shadow priest there is not even a need to worry about that mp5 loss.<br>
<br>
Anyway, i'm just putting it out there that +6 stats is a raid viable enchant.<br>
Thoughts please.<br>

</div>That was kindof the point i was trying to get to, ie at what point will the crit from one jump of chain heal be a near certainty. Comparing crit betweens FoL and chain heal is not really viable. For every cast there are 3 individual chances to crit, and therefore the value of crit when applied to chain heal would be much greater than FoL would it not? <br>
<br>
What I am looking for is X amount of crit, when applied to chain heal will result in y percentage of crits per chain heal cast, with a hope that at some point the value of Y will equal 1.  I'm immediatly thinking around 30% but i have a feeling it will be lower than this ( and that would not be a realistic amount to build into resto set)<br>
<br>
I understand 3xT2 will give a greater benefit, unfortunatly this char only became my main in TBC, and the chances of returning to BWL enough times to gain the 3 pieces are beyond slim. Hence the investigation into crit as a viable alternative to pimp CH.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

6mp5 would not change that as you'd only gain 110 mana back in that time. Not enough for another CH5 cast.<br>
<br>
Add 6.6 intellect (BoK)<br>
Spell crit 10.08 %<br>
+Heal 2202.2<br>
Mana 13099<br>
<br>
You'd still last 92s, however, the HPM would increase by 0.01 and approx 1hps better. Doesn't sound alot, but for me, i don't miss the mp5 and would rather have the extra stats. <br>
<br>
Would this improve over a 10 minute fight? The extra heal and crit directly affects the amount of healing done and if you get a shadow priest there is not even a need to worry about that mp5 loss.<br>
<br>
Anyway, i'm just putting it out there that +6 stats is a raid viable enchant.<br>
Thoughts please.<br>
<br>

There's a phrase i'm fond of, 'Over Engineering' Based on your current gear levels neither 6mp5 or 6 stats would make a huge difference to your performance. So this, in my opinion, is more of a personal choice. Benefits of 6 stats, obviously sta and int, none of the other stats are relevant. <br>
<br>
So the choice is between 60 HP and 90 mana and + 2 heals  or 6 mp5. Worst case scenario you get put in a tank grp, or have no SP you'd benefit from the MP5 more.  There's potential to gem around this too and maybe switch out some royal gems for + heals. (i have'nt checked your armoury i doubt you need gear advice  )<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">That was kindof the point i was trying to get to, ie at what point will the crit from one jump of chain heal be a near certainty. Comparing crit betweens FoL and chain heal is not really viable. For every cast there are 3 individual chances to crit, and therefore the value of crit when applied to chain heal would be much greater than FoL would it not? <br>
<br>
What I am looking for is X amount of crit, when applied to chain heal will result in y percentage of crits per chain heal cast, with a hope that at some point the value of Y will equal 1.  I'm immediatly thinking around 30% but i have a feeling it will be lower than this ( and that would not be a realistic amount to build into resto set)<br>
<br>
I understand 3xT2 will give a greater benefit, unfortunatly this char only became my main in TBC, and the chances of returning to BWL enough times to gain the 3 pieces are beyond slim. Hence the investigation into crit as a viable alternative to pimp CH.</div>

Short answer no, i don't think it's even close.<br>
<br>
You are using a metric to compare the two that in no way represents actual combat. You are determining the value of the stats under a very specific set of conditions, i.e. maximizing the total amount healed by spamming rank 5 chain heal until oom. Under these conditions mp5 has almost no value and spell crit offers huge returns.<br>
<br>
Now i believe that most people would agree that mp5 &gt; crit, under most normal circumstances. However, the fact is stat weights are dynamic depending on the encounter, and your role in it. Shorter encounters favor haste and int, where as longer fights favor mp5 (healing is always good).  <br>
<br>
While it is possible conditions exsist where +6 stats is better i would say the majority of the time 6mp5 is much better, but hey I'm all for having multiple sets of gear and switching out pieces depending on the fight.<br>

</div>Whilst i'd say it is specific, this also scales if you just 'up' the mp5 to cater for a 10 minute fight. i.e. it's something like 882mp5 needed to spam CH5 for 10 minutes. The benefit is actually greater in that instance for +6stats over mp5 on HPS, the difference being something like being able to heal for an extra 38 seconds, but still not actually putting out any more healing in total over those 38s.<br>
Again, it's not 'real' world per se, but would kind of mirrors having a Shadow Priest, chugging mana pots etc.<br>
<br>
In a looong fight, the mp5 may edge it, but even in a 10 minute fight, you'd only regain 720 mana. <br>
Whilst on a point for point basis, mp5 &gt; crit, i think once you get to a certain point, then the extra crit gained will increase the healing output over the course of the fight. Most fights are between 3 and 7 minutes so MP5 is wasted above a certain threshold (which would be a nice calculation to do)<br>

Nah. No need. Vortexes are on Badge Rewards come 2.4 so you just need to prepare ahead of time. The vendor for the recipe, however, is another story entirely. The wait time on that should be interesting. And I guess it wasn't ever confirmed, but are all operating under the assumption that Vashj and Kael drop essences? If so, then that's probably the only real reason to revisit T5 at all.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

That seems too high, remember each jump has a chance to proc, yet the crit value can only realistically be applied to the initial cast. By that i mean in simplistic terms that 100% crit/ 3 jumps would be an average of 34% crit from stats to achieve one crit per cast. (i am far from a maths genius, so forgive my over simplification)<br>
<br>
How does crit scale in terms of HPS? and is it a viable stat to be focusing on when mp5 is at an optimum level? <br>
<br>
I'm currently trying to build in as much crit as possibly, while retaining as much mp5/heals as possible. This will affect gear choices quite dramatically taking into account gem sockets, and balancing of Mp5. <br>
<br>
I guess ideally i'd like someone to calculate a weight for crit as a stat in terms of how it increases hps on average, and how much crit will equal a certain increase in hps over time. (only in relation to chain heal)<br>
<br>
I know alot is down to personal taste, but coming from a dps background pre tbc, it seems spell crit is underrated for shaman, when we have the ideal spell to take advantage of the stat.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

That is the correct value and formula. What i did was figure out the % chance of 0 crits (call that X)and did 100%-X. Yes each jump can crit, but they can crit one, two, all three at the same time, or even none at all; as they are all independent events. That is if the first bounce cirts (or doesn't) it has no impact on if the next jumps do or do not.<br>
<br>
The way you describe the events would have to be linked, and if the first bounce crit the others would be locked out, also if it didn't cirt the odds of the next 2 jumps criting would have to go up.<br>
<br>
Edits below<br>
<br>
The biggest issue with gearing for crit when healing is what it should do and what it does do can be two drastically different things. Given the small number of spells you cast to between incoming damage to the raid, which could kill targets for which you are responsible, the variance in outcomes will be drastic. The first law of statistics is "unlikely events can and must occur" therefore you will end up with large peeks and valleys in the number of crits per min. So depending on chain heal crit spam to allow you a certain amount HPS is a shaky proposition.<br>
<br>
If we assume a "normal distribution" this means that 75% of your cast sequences will be within three standard deviations, this also means that 12.5% of your sequences will significantly under preform. So by depending on crit to get a certain amount of HPS means about 1 out of 10 times you need to get some healing done before your targets die you will not be up to your standard abilities (tell that to your raid leader). <br>
<br>
At the end of the day while crit will increase your average HPS, counting on it to do so when you really need it to will cause you to fail at your responsibilities from time to time.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_658797"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Yes, i understand your concerns on spell crit. Perhaps I need to explain My thinking a bit better. This is currently how i view healing stats in order of importance.<br>
<br>
1)+ Heals<br>
2)Mp5<br>
3)Spell Crit<br>
4)Sta<br>
5)Int<br>
6)Haste<br>
<br>
Now in my opinion, once heals and MP5 are at a satisfactory level I will look to build in spell crit. These two stats seem to sort themselves through normal gear progression. <br>
<br>
The problem is, that assuming the above are at a workable level, will I be reducing my effectivness by choosing to increase crit or gaining a valuable 'bonus' to an already well balanced set of stats?<br>
<br>
This is why i was hoping for some form of Weighted value on spell crit in relation to chain heal, as I personally feel there is potential for spell crit as an alternative to maxing +heals.<br>
<br>
I haven't had much experience with haste, although I have to admit I do like the sound of building haste into a gear set, but my concerns are the impact on regen with no SP.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
While the initial target of chain heal critting is likely to overheal, in a situation where you are healing say a pack of melee, having the second and third jump of chain heal crit is much less likely to overheal since the jumps heal for much less and all targets are taking roughly equal damage.  I think spellcrit is useful in helping to even out the healing done by the chain heal jumps over the course of a fight.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_658912"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Ok, now i understand what you are getting at. Let me help you make your case somewhat.<br>
<br>
Your view is that all 6 stats related healing have diminishing marginal utility (i.e. each point offers less value than the point before it) and once you reach say 2400 +heals and 350 mp5 self buffed (or less with an SP) the marginal utility gained from spell crit far out weighs the benefit of putting points in either of the other two.<br>

Now i will agree that you can have enough mp5,  almost anytime you end a fight with mana you can say you had to much mp5. However i don't know if healing behaves like that, it could offer liner returns, or due to down ranking +healing may have increasing marginal utility, or even look like a wave.<br>
<br>
So this becomes the question, does additional +healing stop being less beneficial than additional crit? And if so at what point?<br>
<br>
I'm inclined to think +healings slope coefficient on its utility curve is always &gt;=1, meaning each point of healing is at least as good as the point before it. But i don't know if i could ever prove it.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Spell crit can be directly compared to spell haste because they both increase HPS (Healing Per Second). <br>
<br>
1% spell haste increases your HPS by 1% and 1% crit increases HPS by 0.5%. It means 1% haste is worth 2% crit. However you need 15.7 haste rating to get 1% haste and 22.1 crit rating for 1% spell crit. So 15.7 haste is worth 44.2 crit.<br>
<br>
1 haste rating is worth 2.81 spell crit rating (not considering ancestral fortitude). <b>Spell haste is much more valuable than spell crit.</b> (edit: more valuable for HPS !)<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>You are right, 1% spell crit increases HPM by 0.5% in addition to increasing HPS. Let's estimate roughly the impact of this increase in HPM.<br>
<br>
By looking at the numbers in the first post, let's consider a chain heal that heals for 5156 for 513 mana. That makes a HPM of 10.05. With the benefit of 1% crit the HPM becomes 10.1. This increase in HPM is equivalent to a 3 mana reduction  (because 5156/510 = 10.1). It is therefore equivalent to (roughly) 6 mp5. <br>
<br>
Oh my... I thought the increase in HPM was neglictible but apparently it is not the case...<br>
<br>
In conclusion 10 spell crit rating is equivalent to 3,5 haste rating plus 2,7 mp5 (when chain-casting). Seems like a good stat after all... Any other opinion ?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Haste offers no improvement to the subsequent jumps, and it seems using the figures you provided(again over simplified) if indeed 1% crit gives a .5% increase in HPS, then the multiplier affect of the 3 jumps of chain heal would apply an average hps increase from chain heal of 1.5%.  <br>
<br>
If this is correct then chain heal and spell crit would be more viable in certain circumstances.<br>

One thing i haven't factored in is the effect on GCD, although our totems now have a base GCD of 1sec, with our only other instant cast spells being purge (dispells usually handled by totems), the benefit of reducing GCD is negligable.

		<div id="post_message_659040"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Ehrm, no, as stated a rough estimate of 1%crit is to increase your HPS by 0.5%. This means that you go from casting 1000+500+250 chainheals to 1005+502.5+251.25 ones, or from 1750 total to 1758.75 ones on avarage, which surprise surprise is a 0.5% increase. <br>
<br>
Please note that the the linked heal is not 50% of the actual healing done on the previous target, in that case crit would be way nicer, but 50% of what a non-critted heal would have healed for.<br>
<br>
Hast as stated does indeed not at all affect what the following targets are healed for, instead it simply allows you to cast %haste more spells in the same amount of time, ie a straight haste-&gt;HPS conversion. Although at the cost of increased MPS, a burden crit does not share with haste.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>He lumped the entire amount of the chain heal into one number. There is no additional multiplier from crit on chain heal since he already included the entire amount into one number. If one jump of the chain crits is it not a crit for all 3. I haven't had coffee and can't think how the math 3 independant jumps for crit and chain heal right but seems like it would average out to being the same since while there is a greater chance of one jump critting there is also a greater chance for one jump not to crit.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
It seems crit does have it's benefits, and would be more at home in a heals heavy gear set up, as there is some over time HpM benefit.  Haste on the other hand would be more at home in an Mp5 heavy set up, to compenstate for the lack of an HpM benefit.<br>
<br>
I think from my point of view the HpS and HpM benefit of crit appeal to me more than the raw HpS increase of haste. I'm not sure it would be worth attempting to balance the two stats, as without reasonably heavy + haste most of the benefit is lost in lag.<br>
<br>
So, when i eventually get my hands on the T6 helm, a nice shiny spell crit gem will be going in it <!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>It chooses as its next target the one that is missing the most HP.<br>
<br>
For example:<br>
<br>
Person A has 8k out of 10k life. Person B has 10k out of 14k life. Chain heal will choose Person B as its next target.<br>
<br>
This has the effect that usually there is only (significant) overheal on the primary target. The more raid-wide damage flies around, the less overhealing we have. And 85% is actually quite low as a heal percentage (at least at a Tier 6 level).<br>
<br>

		<div id="post_message_661171"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I usually run at about 90% of my heals being Chain Heal.  Last night in Hyjal, I was at 89% but this is mainly due to trash and healing the tanks/melee.  Overheal used to bother me, but I've just come to realize in Hyjal and Black Temple that overheal is just part of being a resto shaman.  I actually have some other shamans in my guild that are telling me i'm a terrible healer due to my overheals.  But I then state to them, you cast 70 heals on Naj'entus while I cast 220.  You go oom with your 70 LHW's and HW's, while i'm still at about 30% mana with my 220 Chain Heals.  I may be at 30%+ overheals, but my melee groups never die.

</div>I can say we have extremely motivated healers that chainpot and whatnot, while most of them are trying to top the healing meters, while doing their assigned job. Due to the good performance we managed to progress faster through SSC/TK than expected, by reducing the number of healers to 7, somethimes 6.<br>
<br>
Nonetheless, most of them have 45-50% overheal when tankhealing is important, except the druids which end up on ~30% due to hots not showing in the combat log on a topped target.<br>
I would not worry much about your 30% OH. it is just part of raid healing.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">It chooses as its next target the one that is missing the most HP.<br>
<br>
For example:<br>
<br>
Person A has 8k out of 10k life. Person B has 10k out of 14k life. Chain heal will choose Person B as its next target.<br>
<br>
This has the effect that usually there is only (significant) overheal on the primary target. The more raid-wide damage flies around, the less overhealing we have. And 85% is actually quite low as a heal percentage (at least at a Tier 6 level).<br>

</div>I've pointed them to anything that will get their thick-headed attitudes towards chain healing.  They're just in the Pre-BC state of mind that overhealing is a bad thing.  Overheals in Burning Crusade are just a part of raiding now.  With the massive mana pools and mana regen that are available at a tier 6 level it just happens.  You don't have to be "smart" with where you place your heals anymore.  If you think someone is going to take damage, you heal them, even if you can't step cancel in time it's just a drop out of a large bucket mana-wise.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Great tip. I've added it to the section that deals with Chain Heal. <br>
<br>
I also added the <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=35750" target="_blank">[Redeemer's Alchemist Stone]</a> This trinket ranks right up there with the one Illidan drops. While it theoretically adds 40 mp5, it will actually add 8-16 mp5 if you drink 1-2 mana pots during a 10 minute fight. However, you're getting mana when you need it the most, which really makes it a great trinket. Not to mention the passive 119 +healing.<br>
<br>
And I know people are wondering: Should I drop a profession and take Alchemy for the new trinket?<br>
<br>
No, you shouldn't drop a profession and take up Alchemy just for this trinket. It's very very good. However, there are some excellent alternatives such as <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33828" target="_blank">[Tome of Diabolic Remedy]</a> or <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28823" target="_blank">[Eye of Gruul]</a> that are available even if your guild isn't killing Illidan.<br>
<br>
However, there are some situations in which it might be adviseable to make a profession change. For example, you have a gathering profession on your main that can be fulfilled by an alt -- Herbalism, Mining or Skinning. It might make sense for your main to take up Alchemy (or another crafting profession such as Enchanting or Jewelcrafting).<br>
<br>
The game is always evolving so I wouldn't base my choice on a profession on a single item.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Aye. I just dropped herbalism to pick up LW for sunwell.  So I'm now LW alchemy but I woudn't really say everyone should do this.  Our GM promised to give 1500g to anyone who speccing LW for the good of the guild.  Drums are a nice additional boost to your group that gets better the more people in group have it so that you can constantly be rotating drums. I do wish drums of restoration would be stronger though. 600 mana and health back seems rather miniscule for people with 11-12k hp / mana.  600 mana back every 2 mins is only 25 mp5 (as opposed to potting which is about 100 mp5) however if all 5 people in the group pop drums in rotation you can get 5x that which is a nice 125mp5 this is when drums start really being nice.  I'll most likely be using drums of battle (haste is decent for a healer as well at least) since I am in the mage group but its nice that there is a healer group friendly dynamic you can stack as well.<br>
<br>
I've felt alchemy was the best profession for a healer but I'd stop short of saying its a requirement.  I can't say enough how valuable the current alchemist stone was on the those progression nights where mana could mean the difference between a kill and a wipe and the new alchemist stone is just amazing.  JC also has some very nice trinkets and of course a profession's value changes everytime a new recipie is introduced.  If no further recipies are introduced before Lich King i'd say that alchemy, JC, and LW look to be most beneficial for a healer in sunwell.  Engineering has some really nice goggles but if you can get a good equivalent in sunwell from a drop the value of Engineering drops off a bit imo.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Yeah, I personally took up alchemy largely for the Alchemist's Stone, but also because I knew that I would be chain chugging mana pots, and it was simply more cost effective to have a potion spec alchemist rather than buying mana pots off of the AH all the time.  And at that time, all of our alchemists were either transmute or elixir.  So it was useful in that way too.  Now with this new trinket, it becomes an even better investment in my opinion.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Glimmering Naaru Sliver<br>
Use: Gain 250 mana each second for 8 seconds. Channeled. (5 min. Cooldown)<br>
Equip: 119 healing.<br>
yeilds 2000mana / 300 =  6.66m/s <br>
6.66m/s  * 5s =  33.3mp5<br>
<br>
This puts the new alchemist stone pretty even with the the best healing trinket out of sunwell.  Alchemist stone returns slightly more if you chain pot at everycool down but considering you don't usually pot until 30-45 s into a fight one could argue it makes them pretty even.  My only gripe would be the 8s of channeling required to get all the mana back. if I have 8 s to stand around I might as well pop a dreamless sleep.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Rawr is a program originally designed to rate gear, enchants and buffs for feral druids. It's creator is now making the platform available to all classes and specs. It’s designed to fill the role currently filled by spreadsheets but Rawr is easier to use and automatically handles item data.<br>
<br>
Console is working on a beta version for Elemental shaman based on Binkenstein’s Shamstats. He has thought about doing a resto version but can’t commit to it until he has a working Elemental model. <br>
<br>
So I wanted to find out if we had anyone with C# knowledge lurking in the resto thread. Rawr is written in C#, using .NET Framework 2.0, using Visual Studio 2008. You can find all the details here: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080412024024/http://elitistjerks.com/f31/t21713-rawr_model_development/" target="_blank">Rawr Model Development</a><!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>For just starting Kara and 5-mans you will be more than okay with using a PVE gemmed gladiator set. Thinking back to when I was first stepping into 25-mans, I was using S1 shoulders and the second-sight helm from Shadowmoon for my healing set.<br>
<br>
Although, with the exceptionally good, easy to get badge gear, you should be able to replace your Gladiator gear fairly quickly if you are doing heroics and what not.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_664970"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Hi I'm a starting resto shaman running Kara and Gruuls, and I greatly benefited from this thread. I don't know how many times I read this thread over and over. So first of all, Thank you so much! <br>
<br>
I have a question and also a correction to make for this thread. They both regard to relic totems.<br>
1. Question: <br>
When you cast Water Shield with [Totem of the Thunderhead] , does the effect last even after you switch your relic totem?<br>
<br>
2. Correction:<br>
This macro you gave us is really great.<br>
<br>
/Cast Chain Heal<br>
/equip Totem of Healing Rains<br>
<br>
I use this macro and variations of this macro for every healing spell because changing relics while casting, in fact, does not activate 1.5 second global cooldown. So canceling a spell to cast another spell within 1.5 second will not endanger us in any way. (Weapons do activate the global cooldown, but relics do not)<br>
<br>

		<div id="post_message_665273"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I used to use the totem macros, but switched them off for arenas, because there you'd constantly run into the gcd issue (especially if canceling heals to shock).

If needed I'll switch them manually (eg EoS when running oom in p2).<br>
The benefit of casting 10 Healing Waves for 24 mana less each in a fight is not significant enough to run into gcd troubles in my opinion.

As a side note: to beginning healers I cannot stress enough that a comfortable and good interface is most important to be a good healer. All those totem macros, knowledge of correct downranking and spell canceling, stat ditribution, etc will not help you if you cannot see who will need heal. Learning how to and ensure you actually can see who will get damage before they actually do is a very important step in becoming a good healer.

</div>Yeah the gcd issue was far more common in arenas and I ended up no longer using them for pvp however for pve its extremely rare that I have ever been on gcd when needing to ns HW.  This usually only happens on Hyjal trash when a tank gets carried away and tries to tank 7 aboms.   Since I am casting CH 90% of the time anywyasI'm usually not swapping totems when an NS heal needs to happen.  Cetainly its something to be aware of and if it causes people to die you need to alter the way you play a little or stop using the macros.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I think you are really missing the point and your math may be off. Are you counting all totems cast rather than those cast after 5 seconds of being in combat on bosses (or very difficult trash)? Elemental warding helps most when the whole raid/parts of the raid are taking damage, i.e. the times when you can least afford spare GCD's to cast healing waves on yourself. Its not about the total damage/mana it saves you it's about when it saves you that damage/mana.<br>
<br>
Under the most ideal conditions with dramatic totem use there is no way totemic focus offers anything better than 25mp5* or 5 mp5 per point, in reality your probably getting around 2-3 mp5 per point, considering someone in early t6 can easily hit 400 mp5 raid buffed thats a very tiny amount of regen. In all likelihood more liberal use of your mana pot cool down would more than make up for your regen lost.<br>
<br>
*in a 8 minute Nightbane switching all totems on each phase, using both elementals, two uses of mana tide, and very liberal use of tremor; i manged to get this talent to return about 22mp5 and that was pushing it.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Using a full instance WWS parse to compare Elemental Warding to Totemic Focus is completely pointless. Whatever mana you spend or save during trash when casting totems is largely irrelevant to how good Totemic Focus actually is because you can just drink back to full after every pull. You also very very rarely run into OOM problems during trash. Saving a little bit of mana from Totemic Focus on trash pulls is not worth 5 talent points. Ever. The only reason totemic focus should ever be considered is if you seriously think you're going to be laying enough totems during a boss encounter for it to be worth it. Having cleared every single encounter in TBC pre-2.4, I haven't run into a single boss in which Totemic Focus would be worth it. For this reason I consider Totemic Focus to be one of the weakest (if not THE weakest) talent in the Restoration tree.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Brutallus is currently a DPS race. The preferred spec on that fight would probably be 0-12-49 to boost the DPS of hunters or feral druids (if you didn't have an enhancement shaman). Of course, with an instant ghost wolf available in 2.4 through talents, a lot of use may switch to 0-12-49 and insist we are only doing it to boost raid DPS.  <br>
<br>
I'm still sticking with 8-0-53 as the best raiding spec. I can see from your gear that you've been in BT for a long time. You probably long ago learned to avoid Azgalor's rain of fire and probably never get feared into Doom Fire on Archimonde. For a shaman in your position, Elemental Warding will hold few benefits. However, 95% of the shaman reading this post are not farming BT. The 8-0-53 spec is going to be the most beneficial for them.<br>
<br>
There's nothing wrong with 0-5-56, but you're not getting a lot for the extra talent points you're spending in the Enhancement and Restoration trees. Ancestral Knowledge doesn't even give you enough mana for one extra chain heal. Totemic Focus provides very little mp5 saved in most raid situations.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_666235"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->"not enough mana for one extra chain heal" is not a viable argument. Saying something has a neglicible effect is not enough to rule it out. The reason the talent sucks is that any other talent option will be less neglicible than the mana you get from 5% max mana...<br>
<br>
Just the fact you can take/drop a lot of talents/item choices without seeing a difference in your healing ability doesn't mean it's the way to go. If you use "this is neglicible" as an argument to do/not do something you can pretty much drag it in to doing whatever you want and still be fine. And on some standards you will do fine - probably even good enough to clear the whole game. But it doesn't mean it's a good choice. Choosing the best items/talents is based on looking at what kind of a small difference in raiding capability would be made when you make a small difference to your stats/talent choices, then assume the gains are approximately linear (and they are approximately linear for small changes) and compare what would make a "less small" difference and pick that.<br>
<br>
Also an enhancement shaman should never realistically be in a hunter/feral group, as he will be with the rogues+dps warrior (plus whatever leftover melee you have). Numbers show it's most likely not worth it to have an enhancement shaman for the hunter group, so if you run with 4-5 shamans in a raid speccing into those totems can actually benefit raid dps. Elemental warding, however, is very powerful for the few fights where it does help, as those fights are generally a "you need minimum X HP over anything else" which means both that your HP requirement there goes down and that reducing damage taken is *that* important on that fight, and it's more than just requiring less healing, it's also much needed extra effective HP. Optimally you'd respec based on the fight and raid/party composition, of course ;p<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Someone did some theorycrafting that said that considering your run 2 WF groups, putting the feral with the enhance shaman and thus a rogue in the tank group with WF will net more raid dps. This even was assuming the shaman didnt totem twist. (though some people said his math may have been off, it seemed pretty strong when I took a look at it)<br>
<br>
Anyway, with the movement needed in many fights, I'd be amazed if an enhance shaman can keep hunters in range of his totems without loosing a big amount of DPS.<br>
<br>
Probably because it's late, but I'm not exactly sure where that remark about enhance shamans came actually.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I use this macro and variations of this macro for every healing spell because changing relics while casting, in fact, does not activate 1.5 second global cooldown. So canceling a spell to cast another spell within 1.5 second will not endanger us in any way. (Weapons do activate the global cooldown, but relics do not)</div>

</div>Thank you everyone in this forum to point out that changing relic in fact does cost GCD. I thought I was sure, but I guess I just never tested it out while in combat. I'm going to be more careful about using the macro now.<br>
<br>
Another thing... I don't know if anyone can test my question for me. I would test it myself, wearing nothing but the relic and watch the mana, but I don't have [Totem of the Thunderhead], and I'm wondering if it's worth farming it.<br>
<br>
I'll add another question. My NS-Heal macro doesn't work correctly a lot of times, and I'd have to press the button twice to cast NS and heal. Does anyone have this problem too?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Yet Another Totem Addon (YATA): I've used quite a few totem addons (including CoE and TT), and this is the one that I've taken to my heart. A matter of taste of course, but I find it worthy of mentioning in your qualitative post. It's updateable through WoWace as well.<br>

Earth Shield Tracker (ES Tracker). Gives a small tracker that shows the remaining number of charges and the time left. Handy to put beside Yata.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
<b>Cast Times and Latency</b><br>
<br>
You always want to start casting your next heal before the first one finishes casting. This is due to latency – or the time it takes for a command from the client to make a round trip to the server and back. However, if you hit the button too early (i.e. mashing buttons) it will slow you down slightly because the server says, “Spell not ready” and you have to send the request again to the server. To time this perfectly, install a mod such as Quartz. The portion of your cast bar in red represents your latency. As soon as the spell you are currently casting reaches the red zone, you can safely start casting your next spell. This will give maximum casting speed.<br>
<br>
This method works well as long as you have 10-12 frames per second (FPS). If you have 5 FPS, you are only seeing the Quartz bar update every 0.2 seconds. You may be better off “mashing the buttons” in this case. <br>
<br>

</div>Forgive me for not having read the whole thread, but given that this is still on the front page I'm going to assume that it hasn't been addressed.  I was under the impression that given the change a couple patches ago, where your request gets sent to the server whether you are currently casting or not, that the best way to cast now IS in fact to spam the button so that you have a more-or-less constant stream of "cast next spell" commands going to the server.  Thus, the server will start casting the spell while you are still waiting to hear back that it was finished casting on your end.  If this is true then using quartz to estimate the latency is not necessary and in fact slows down your casting due to the fact that you are trying to react something and are never going to be prefect at it.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
 What mp5 unbuffed while casting do you recommend? i was told around 200 before<br>
<br>
 9 healing 4 int is generally what i use in yellow sockets to get bonus's should i be using 18 healing in every red socket?<br>
<br>
 Also whats "SW"?, id say basically my mp5 is kind of terrible with my gear atm since i am sitting on 0 t6 yet due to recently joining the guild so giving up a lot of mp5 for straight healing will hurt me on long fights where i might not get a shadow priest<br>
<br>
 My general gemming is<br>
<br>
 Red = 9 healing 2mp5 and i have like 1 or 2 18 healing<br>

</div>I agree that haste is a bit overrated (and I use a lower value when evaluating my own gear).  However, the reason for such a high value is that, like +healing, it is never wasted (except at the highest values, which I think are unreachable currently).  Haste gives you a straight increase to healing per second, so to make up for the loss of mp5 you can just downrank.  Just like with +healing.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Thanks Skyhoof for all the efforts you have put into this.<br>
<br>
I think you may be overvaluing int for your gear rankings.<br>
<br>
If I look at what one point of int gives me (assuming BoK), I get:<br>
0.33 heal + 0.3036 crit + 16.5 mana<br>
<br>
Now if I assuming I’m gearing up for an 8 minute boss fight (don’t ask me why I chose 8 minutes), that 16.5 mana gets 2 mana tides added to it for 24.42 mana or the equivalent of 0.254375 mp5<br>
<br>
So the formula for one point of int is now<br>
0.33 heal + 0.3036 crit + 0.254375 mp5<br>
<br>
Crit, although less reliable, can be directly theorycrafted into heal (assuming you don’t assess a penalty to it, and assuming a 2000+heal shaman)…1 crit is the equivalent of .452899 heal.<br>
<br>
MP/5, can’t be perfectly converted into +heal but if I use your number of 3.75 mp5 to 1 heal, I get a ratio of .293333<br>
<br>
So just using heal, I get a point of int with BoK is:<br>
0.33 heal + 0.1375 heal + 0.074617 heal = 0.542117 heal.<br>
<br>
Using the numbers above, your ranking numbers of:<br>
Stam = 0.30 <br>
Int = 0.75 <br>
Spirit = 0.1 <br>
Healing = 1.1 <br>
Crit = 0.5 <br>
Mp5 = 3.75 <br>
Haste = 0.75 <br>
Armor = 0.01<br>
<br>
Become:<br>
Stam = 0.30 <br>
Int = 0.596328333<br>
Spirit = 0.1 <br>
Healing = 1.1 <br>
Crit = 0.5 (actually 0.4988 so you are right on there).<br>
Mp5 = 3.75 <br>
Haste = 0.75 <br>
Armor = 0.01<br>
<br>
The tricky number is the Mp5 number…basically if you value 3.75 mp5 MORE than 1.1 healing, then the coefficient for int would increase…if you valued it less, it would decrease.<br>
<br>
Hope this helps,<br>
--JG</div>

	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div><br>
The calculations in this post are incorrect.<br>
1 INT does not give 0.33 heal + 0.3036 crit + 16.5 mana with BoK<br>
<br>
1 INT gives 0.33 heal + ((1/80)*1.1) crit + 16.5 mana<br>
<br>
Basically the crit value should be 0.01375 with kings, 0.0125 without.<br>

This could give you another 20-25 mp5. Does your guild run Gruul anymore? He drops a mp5 trinket. Or just keep running ZA and hope you get lucky on the trinket drop there.<br>
<br>
If you’re not sure if a socket bonus is worthwhile, use Shamstats. It has a gem optimizer function on the main page.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Firstly fantastic to see a post for the Shaman Healers, I hope this post achieves the epic proportions that Malan's Enhancement Shaman post achieved.<br>
<br>
Like Malan I am primarily our raiding Enhancement Shaman, but for certain raids (usually if one of our main healers is out) I respec and heal.<br>
<br>
I'd just like to add my recommendation for a healing addon- Healbot.<br>
<br>
Its layout is very similar to Grid, has incoming heal tracking, and is easily configured. But my favourite function is the ease at which you can set the "on click" spells. For example, I have Rank 4 Chain Heal on Left click, Natures Swfitness + Healing Wave on Right Click, Mousewheel up for Cleanse Poison, Mousewheel Down for Cleanse Disease and Shift modifier for my downranked spells.<br>
<br>
What made this addon for me was how damn easy it was to configure. For those of you always on the lookout for something new I can highly recommend it.</div>

</div>I am 100% sure that I got an immune message. Now, I assumed it was from the Ice Tomb and not the Frost Shock. I could be wrong. Are you sure your totem absorbed the Tomb and not the Frost Shock? Is it absorbing the “tomb” affect but immune to some secondary effect that has to do with the threat drop?<br>

</div>It depends what stats you want to value. Try using T5 stat weights. Brooch of Nature's Mercy falls below Lord Sanguinar's Claim, Nadina's Pendant of Purity, Brooch of the Highborne and Amulet of Flowing Life<br>
<br>
However, if haste and +healing are want you want, the Brooch cannot be beat.<br>

</div>As an aside, both Guardian Totems and Nature's Guidance are solid arena/PvP talents, and I can see their use in a dual-purpose PvP/PvE resto build.  Sacrificing 5 talents from the resto tree to acquire them only requires a mild opportunity cost from the resto tree when it comes to a full PvE build.  2.4 will obviously carry this forward with 0/9/52 builds that pick up Improved Ghost Wolf along with Guardian Totems.  Those talents have no value in PvE, but they do not require a back-breaking sacrifice from the Resto tree.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Please read the section on choosing talents. Guardian totems makes me cry. So does a resto shaman putting points into Nature’s Guidance<br>
<br>
Personally, I find 180 mp5 while casting a little on the high side but it’s not unreasonable. Do you have <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33505" target="_blank">[Totem of Living Water]</a>? This could give you another 20-25 mp5. Does your guild run Gruul anymore? He drops a mp5 trinket. Or just keep running ZA and hope you get lucky on the trinket drop there.<br>
<br>
If you’re not sure if a socket bonus is worthwhile, use Shamstats. It has a gem optimizer function on the main page.</div>

</div>Thanks for the info. I have guardian totems because of the PvP I do on the side, I plan to respec to 8/0/53 soon. I have the totem from Karazhan, <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28523" target="_blank">[Totem of Healing Rains]</a><br>
<br>
 Guild doesn't bother with Gruul other then alt runs, I have been running ZA like crazy trying to get the <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33828" target="_blank">[Tome of Diabolic Remedy]</a> but my luck has been bad.<br>
<br>
 I think I will keep 170mp5 while casting my target goal and gem for plus healing more fervently as I gather the rest of my gear.<br>
<br>
 Any other tips are great, I am trying to use that spreadsheat you recommended but I am terrible with them.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I use Pitbull for my raid frames. I don't use Grid. I don't use Clique.

</div>This is precisely why I use mouseover macros and Pitbull.  Pitbull unfortunely seems to loose the group UI frames when zoneing frequently though.  I find the large buff icons for totems extremely handy for telling if all of my group has my totems at a glance.  Even with that horribly annoying bug I still prefer it over grid I just hand the raid icons on my actual raid bars very handy for all those fights where bigwigs or DBM places raid icons on targets.  I do keep a small grid tucked away in a corner when I try to minimize overhealing but thats rare and maybe only happens 5-10% of the time.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_670642"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->So I'm not really a numbers guy and I've been taking a look over the new Sunwell gear and had a few thoughts. At first glance it looks like we're getting a lot of red sockets and haste over what the current tier 6 gear provides. Instantly I thought that I was going to end up loading up my gear with lots of spinels and end up with a lot more +heal and a lot of haste which I currently do not stack. <br>
<br>
Since stacking +healing is pretty much for 1) downranking and 2) increasing the heal on the CH jumps, is option 1 going to be viable in late in 2.4? I know CH3 gets a penalty, and the mana saved between ranks 3-4 is a lot smaller than 4-5. Assuming we're sticking with CH4 though, with a lot more +healing and haste with no great increase to mana regen (like priests and druids are getting), should I end up going with royal shadowsongs to buff my mp5 to compensate for the haste?<br>
<br>
Maybe I'm thinking haste is going to drain my mana a lot faster than it really will. Maybe I'm not making any sense at all. Thoughts?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I found it unresponsive at low fps, very slow to update and primarily the cause of alot of memory usage.<br>
You also had to /reload ui to get it to update whenever you changed a spell on the mouse clicking, which got very annoying indeed.<br>
Grid and Clique are, imo, the better option.</div>

</div>I think people are being unfair to healbot. I do not see it taking up allot of memory, right now not being in a raid I have Scrolling Combat text taking up 1,05 MB. Healbot 802 KB. After tonight I will tell you what these numbers are in a raid. I have never had a problem with slow updates during raid, but my fps is always above 30. You can also raise or lower your refresh rate<br>
Healbot does take up allot of time to setup to your needs, unlike its rumor. There are many different options which you might overlook at first glance and might make your healbot act strangely. Like the fluidbar option, which makes healthbars slowly lose health instead of instantly as the game default, making it absolutely impossible to judge how much healing a person needs. So be sure to have fluid bars turned off. It does not exchange incoming heals with grid and its incoming heal with other healbot users is not fully reliable.<br>
For me Healbot gives me a quick overview of who in raid needs healing and how much, so I can react quickly with the right spell. I do not like grid because of it box form which makes it close to impossible to see how much damage people have taken, at least for me. In healbot you can make the healthbars the excat size and colour you want.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Grid is exactly the same. It can show how much you will overheal when the spell hits too. And you can size, shape and colour grid exactly how you want aswell.<br>
<br>
It's a preference thing, but having tried both, I found the grid/clique combo both easier to use, configure and manage than healbot.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
Rawr is a program originally designed to rate gear, enchants and buffs for feral druids. It's creator is now making the platform available to all classes and specs. It’s designed to fill the role currently filled by spreadsheets but Rawr is easier to use and automatically handles item data.<br>
<br>
Console is working on a beta version for Elemental shaman based on Binkenstein’s Shamstats. He has thought about doing a resto version but can’t commit to it until he has a working Elemental model. <br>
<br>
So I wanted to find out if we had anyone with C# knowledge lurking in the resto thread. Rawr is written in C#, using .NET Framework 2.0, using Visual Studio 2008. You can find all the details here: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080415085146/http://elitistjerks.com/f31/t21713-rawr_model_development/" target="_blank">Rawr Model Development</a></div>

</div>Skyhoof, your post is a week old but I see no other responses.  I am a C# developer and in fact have been added as a dev on the Rawr project.  I am currently in the process of gearing up to switch my level 69 Shaman to Resto so a Resto Shaman module of Rawr is of interest to me as well.  I simply do not have the time  (or to be honest knowledge of Resto Shamans as of yet) to do a module myself, but I am more than willing to help someone else working on it.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_671341"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Regarding the addon usage questions:<br>
<br>
I see a lot of people on this forum utilizing Grid + Clique.  I gave Grid a whirl but had some trouble getting used to it.  I've been using Pitbull + Clique and enjoy the functionality.  It seemed a little more clear to set up than memorizing what the different corner dots would mean in Grid.  I think the customization process in Pitbull can be ungainly and might scare people away before it is even set up, but once it's going, buffs and debuffs are clearly displayed, incoming heals seem prompt and accurate (I don't have a mechanic to test that) and the cleanse-able debuff auras are obvious (and with Decursive, can be set to trigger a sound...admittedly, in a raid that sound could approach a drum solo, but I am not in 25-man content as yet).  <br>
<br>
I also like the customizable range dimming so I could make it blatantly obvious when folks were out of range or, as a secondary indicator, mind-controlled or otherwise taken out of combat.  I can't fault the Grid users since I'm just entering the healing game (healed through Kara thus far) and I suspect its usefulness would increase dramatically in larger raids where screen real estate becomes an issue (as well as economy of mouse travel for healing).<br>
<br>
For those with game window real-estate problems due to addons I use CTViewport to shrink the rendered window.  I have a monitor that's on the large side so I don't notice any loss in that respect.  Having all of my raid bars, action bars and chat boxes off the screen is a nice help.  It's a personal preference thing since a healer may not feel the need to have point and click access to every part of the game screen, but I really enjoy it so I figured I'd throw it out there.<br>
<br>
Thanks for this thread as I check it daily and it continues to give me a leg-up on playing a resto Shaman to its fullest.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_671384"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Like others, I use Grid and Clique too.  I very recently switched from dps warrior to resto shaman for the raid.  These two mods, once set to my own preference, have been such a blessing and have made 25-man healing so much fun.  Here is a WWS of my first time in BT on the shaman (Gintan)using mostly Karazhan gear: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080415085146/http://wowwebstats.com/6dge1y63y3x4m" target="_blank">Wow Web Stats</a><br>
<br>
I'm seeing things I need to fix still, like remembering to use Earth Shield more often <br>
<br>
For Clique:<br>
<br>
Left click - CH4<br>
Shift left click - CH5<br>
Control left click - NS/Trinket/CH5 macro<br>
Right click - HW8<br>
Shift right click - HW12<br>
Control right click - NS/Trinket/HW12 macro<br>
Scroll wheel click - Select target<br>
Mouse button 4 - LHW7<br>
Shift mouse button 4 - Trinket/Earth Shield macro<br>

		<div id="post_message_673391"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->re: Healing Way for 25 man raiding<br>
<br>
I have recently specced out of Healing Way (from 8/0/53), because I never cast Healing Wave on one target enough for it to be worthwhile. If I do cast healing wave, it's generally off a nature's swiftness.<br>
<br>
If I am casting a series of heals on a tank, I use chain heal because of the bounce (or chance to bounce.)<br>
<br>
Healing Way is a significant buff to the HPS and HPM of healing wave. However, I haven't run into a situation where using chain heal on a tank was too taxing on my mana, or where it just wasn't providing high enough HPS.<br>
<br>
As a result, I decided to put the points into Ancestral Knowledge instead. Yes, the mana from Ancestral Knowledge is not much, however I am getting nothing at all from Healing Way.<br>
<br>
I'm curious as to whether anyone else has a similar experience in terms of not getting use from Healing Way in 25 man raids.<br>
<br>
My experience might be more due to the way healing plays out in the guild I'm in. Or, it could be that Healing Way is in general a pretty mediocre talent in 25 man raiding, and it's worth considering whether one of the other medicore talents is a better use of those three points.<br>
<br>
(Note - I'm only concerned with the value of Healing Way in 25 man raids, because that's what I want my spec optimised for.)<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_673405"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->At the moment my thinking is that even in cases like healing the fel rage target:<br>
a) chain heal = less HPS on the single target but provides additional healing from bounces, and<br>
b) healing way + healing wave = more HPS on the single target.<br>
<br>
And taking into account that there are other healers spamming the target, a) &gt; b).<br>
I'm not sure how you could go about theorycrafting this, as it would be dependant on factors like how many other healers are in the raid and what they are doing.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_673468"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->On second thoughts, you're right about fel rage ... there generally won't be anyone in range to take bounces. So, Healing Way / Healing Wave is better if you are healing the fel rage target.<br>
However, this didn't occur to me initially because I'm assigned to raid healing and not healing the person with fel rage. ie I'm casting chain heals around the raid rather than spamming the fel rage tank.<br>
<br>
What I am interested to hear from other resto shamans is whether their experience is similar to mine, or if there are cases where they are getting use from Healing Way.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>No i base my statement on the fact than when called on to single target heal on a MT, after a paladin Dc's lets say, your HPS without healing way &lt; than your HPS with healing way. Given that the MT needs X-HPS to be &gt; Y-Damage per second from the raid boss, significantly lower personal HPS will push X closer to Y increasing the odds of MT death and a wipe.<br>
<br>
Are the odds of this happing very likely? No they are in fact probably quite small, my assertion however is that this scenario has far greater odds of being the game breaker than the +/- 600 mana gained via Ak. <br>
<br>
Or to simplify the potential gains from the rarely used healing way far outweigh the gains from the rarely used last 600 mana on my cast bar.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>You seem to be forgetting that when cast Healing Wave on a target, any other shaman in your raid also healing that target with Healing Wave will benefit from the buff.<br>
<br>
Ancestral Knowledge is a weak talent. The key to shaman healing is how much mana we can regenerate, not how much we have at the start. <br>
<br>
You are gimping yourself by not having Healing Way. You are only useful in a raid when spamming chain heal. This limits your utility. I do nothing in Illidan Phase 2 except spam Healing Wave on one of the two tanks on the blades. In Archimonde, the main tank healers frequently go out of range and I have to cast Healing Wave on the tank until they can run back. Someone already mentioned healing the Fel Rage target. Do you never do ZA? Heroics?<br>
<br>
Frankly, if a shaman didn't have Healing Way, I wouldn't want them in my 25-man raid.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

It will bring your DPS up ever so slightly(due to crit), but compared to the item budget cost, it's useless.</div>

</div>I fully agree with your thoughts Raut on Healing Wave. Priests are more efficient at bombing heals but I have no troubles with holding down that spot. Rank 9 HW is around 4300-4400 for me with healing way making a very nice buffer on spike damage. The 16-20% crits I get means ancestral healing will almost always be up reducing spikes. A priest with his lower crit chance will not always be able to do this.<br>
<br>
On stamina I totally disagree. Low life means a dead healer. To many times have I seen my 10.5-12K buffed life go to almost nothing in a flash. If I had been at 9K it would have been a wipe. It use to be said healers do not get hit but in BC this is no longer true, everyone takes damage.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">On second thoughts, you're right about fel rage ... there generally won't be anyone in range to take bounces. So, Healing Way / Healing Wave is better if you are healing the fel rage target.<br>
However, this didn't occur to me initially because I'm assigned to raid healing and not healing the person with fel rage. ie I'm casting chain heals around the raid rather than spamming the fel rage tank.<br>
<br>
What I am interested to hear from other resto shamans is whether their experience is similar to mine, or if there are cases where they are getting use from Healing Way.</div>

</div>I can understand why a shaman could get away with not getting healing way and do fine 90% of the time.  However I strongly feel that it limits my flexibility on what I can do.  Sure we are BEST in a raid healing situation.  I however, do single target heal.  Illidan in phase 1 and assisting in phase 2 if needed, Archimonde, Bloodboil, Supremus, all sorts of things in ZA esp. Bear and Bear trash.   Can you do it without healing way? Sure but its basically 3 points that you don't use all the time when you do use them make a great deal of difference and I don't feel there is any other place where those 3 points can be spent that make up for this.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_674168"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Hey guys, I'm currently at 3 pieces of tier 6 and was wondering when the 5% to Chain Heal on the 4-piece set bonus was added.  The front page says that this bonus is only worth 53 +healing.  That seems rather low.  My first chain heal averages 3337 (without counting crits).  With all 3 jumps, that 5840 healing.  So if it's a straight multiplier, my first jump would be 3504 and total heal would be 6132.<br>
<br>
Playing around with some of my gear, removing eye of gruul (44 heal) lowers my first jump CH by 42.  Removing Essence of the Martyr (84 heal) lowers my first jump CH by 80. So that sounds like the 167 first jump heal increase from the 4-piece bonus is worth about +175 healing. <br>
<br>
As for the 2-piece bonus, the front page says it's worth 37 mp5.  I save 54 mana per chain heal with the 2-piece bonus.  With my mediocre 70 haste, I can cast 2.09 chain heals per 5 seconds.  That means if I'm spamming perfectly, that 2-piece bonus is worth 54*2.09 =  112.9 mp5.  Granted, I'm not always spamming chain heal but it does happen quite a lot.  And in high intensity situations like that, the 2-piece bonus seriously rocks.<br>

</div>Answer is it depends. The first has noticeably better efficiency while the 2nd has noticeably higher HPS. The deciding factor (and what you should've taken into account when making those values) is how much of other stats you're willing to sacrifice in favor of others, especially when it comes to stats that give HPS VS stats that don't. Losing people due to not healing them back up fast enough is bad, but losing people because you didn't have the mana to cast the heals to cover the boss' damage is just as bad. It all depends how likely you are to run into either situation, and how much each stat would actually help you avoid it.<br>
<br>
That's why you can't put a value on stats and call it a day. You have to look at a case by case basis or these kinds of (rather pointless and not-answerable) comparisons and questions will keep popping up.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Those numbers came from an earlier version of ShamStats. But no matter what values you assign to the set bonuses, they are extremely valuable. Using the latest version of ShamStats, I get:<br>
<br>
4T6 = [See Binkenstein's post below]<br>
<br>
Using 90% chain heal with a modifier of 1.4167 ((1+1.5+1.75)/3) and 2000 + Healing with no haste<br>
<br>
Talented chain heal costs 513 mana at rank 5 so you are saving 51.3 mana (assuming you have Totem of Healing Rains equipped and not Totem of Living Water)<br>
And let’s assume with latency and other factors you cast a Chain Heal every 3 seconds (20 heals per minute). That would be 85.5 mp5 ((51.3 x 20)/12). If you cast 15 Chain Heals per minute, you save 64 mp5.<br>
<br>
However, I'll let Binkenstein have the final say and then update the main page.<br>
<br>
Your math is not wrong (except for the cost of Chain Heal) but it assumes an ideal scenario whereas ShamStats provides a more realistic estimate. And my mp5 calculations are on the conservative side. You would obviously get a higher value by assuming either more casts per minute or wearing gear with haste.<br>
<br>
EDIT: Changed my estimate of the value of 4T6 to the value Binkenstein gave below so there would be no confusion<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Assuming I used all of the Healing Trance buffs given by this trinket with Chain Heal Rank 5, that would mean it gave me 60 Mp5. The log that I actually posted is no longer available for viewing, unfortunately, but I guarantee you it was legit.<br>
<br>
However, today I'm ready to share a number of logs from my more recent Illidari Council fights. It seems from these numbers that the trinket may have been nerfed:<br>

<br>
<br>
As you can see, never again has the trinket procced enough to give me an MP5 figure even close to the one I posted way back there. Our fight duration on Illidari Council has gone down a decent amount, but not by THAT much, and my healing assignment and playstyle for these logs has not changed in the least - which is to spam chain heal nonstop on Gathios tank.<br>
<br>
Is the trinket nerfed or did I get lucky?<br>

What I mainly wanted to point out was that the set bonuses are well worth a little dip in stats to get.  The resto shaman I usually raid with has an extremely high opinion of haste and a relatively low opinion of tier 6 (he even said he would use the ZA shoulders over the tier 6 shoulders).  <br>
<br>
Especially with Sunwell coming out, people need to know whether the new pieces are worth breaking the set bonuses or not.  I'm glad they added tier 6 boots, belts, and bracers or else these decisions would be even more difficult.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Oh, I see.  While 1.4167 may be more realistic than 1.75, it's still a rather arbitrary assumption.  Should we be including other assumptions in a healing spreadsheet?  Like 35% of regular heals are overheal.  45% of crits are overheal.  A healer averages one heal every 3 or 4 seconds.  I guess that's the problem with modeling healing.  The healing environment changes almost every second in a fight and you may be relying on a different set of stats to perform your job.  On top of that, each person might have a different job or heal in a completely different manner.<br>
<br>
On a similar note, I generally base my stat valuations on those intense situations that determine the outcome of a fight.  So while saying that the 2-piece bonus averages out to 64 mp5 is fine, I don't really care how much mana I'm saving when only light damage is occuring.  My mana regen or a small mana potion will take care of that anyway.  What matters to me is that when I'm forced to spam chain heals and have a limited amount of outside mana regen (maybe one mana potion or mana tide), the 2-piece set bonus is vastly improving my mana efficiency.  Personally, I think a high intensity healing model would allow me to better choose the stats I need on my gear.<br>
<br>
As for the tier6 bonus, I thought the front page was saying that it was equal to +53 healing (the stat), not actual healing in a real world model.  I wanted a way to evaluate the itemization value of the set bonus and figure out how much +heal I would need to make up for it's loss.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_674643"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->If we assume that every chain heal will hit three targets, we may be over-valuing stats because of it.

		<div id="post_message_674707"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->About the Healing Way discussion: You have to remember that there is a point after which CH is more efficient on a single target than Healing Wave with 3 stacks of Healing Way. Once you reach that point of +healing (which was somewhere above 2k), the only reason to use Healing Wave would be max-rank to put out as much HPS as possible on a single target.<br>
<br>
Once you reach that point, a very good argument could be made for not taking Healing Way and instead putting those points somewhere else.<br>
<br>
I decided to do the math on this, and these are my results. Please check the Math.<br>
<br>
CH 4 on 1 target: Base(648) + +heal*0.71*1.1*1.2*1.05<br>
Manacost of CH 4: 435*0,9*0,95=372 Mana<br>
If you have 2200 + heal, that would mean an average heal of 2813, a HPS on one target of ~1125 and a HPM of 7.56.<br>
<br>
Lets look at what rank of HW is needed in order to achieve the same HPS.<br>
HW has a base multiplier of 0,86*1,18*downranking coefficient. The downranking coefficient I get for HW 8 is 0.86 and for HW 9 is 0.91.<br>
<br>
To get a relatively close HPS number, we would have to use HW 8 (982 HPS) or 9 (1202 HPS).<br>
HW 8: Base(1092) + +heal*0.86*1.18<br>
Manacost of HW 8: 485*0,95=461 Mana<br>
HW 8: Base(1464) + +heal*0.86*1.18<br>
Manacost of HW 9: 615*0,95=584 Mana<br>
<br>
HW 8 would heal for 2455 at a cost of 460.75 Mana for a HPM of 6.52.<br>
HW 9 would heal for 3005 at a cost of 584.25 Mana for a HPM of 6.<br>
<br>
The conclusion: If you have 4T6 and at least 2200 +heal, CH is more mana efficient than HW for healing a single target - even with Healing Way.<br>
<br>
After those results, I decided to take a look at what amount of +heal is needed to make CH more efficient than HW on a single target.<br>
<br>
I made a small spreadsheet in which I entered the calculations, and if I did everything correctly the conclusion is this: if you have 4T6 it is always more efficient to heal a single target with CH than with HW. To have HW be more efficient than CH 4 while achieving the same HPS, you would have to have about 1k +heal. For CH5 the break even point is at about 1700 +heal.<br>
<br>
If you only have 2T6 the break even point is at about 1300 +heal for CH 4, and at a very high number (2800 or so) for CH 5.<br>
<br>
Two things about those results: First of all, they let you appreciate the power of 2T6 and 4T6. Secondly, theylet you appreciate the effectiveness and efficiency of CH4. Thirdly, they show you how inefficient CH5 is.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">You seem to be forgetting that when cast Healing Wave on a target, any other shaman in your raid also healing that target with Healing Wave will benefit from the buff.<br>
<br>
Ancestral Knowledge is a weak talent. The key to shaman healing is how much mana we can regenerate, not how much we have at the start. <br>
<br>
You are gimping yourself by not having Healing Way. You are only useful in a raid when spamming chain heal. This limits your utility. I do nothing in Illidan Phase 2 except spam Healing Wave on one of the two tanks on the blades. In Archimonde, the main tank healers frequently go out of range and I have to cast Healing Wave on the tank until they can run back. Someone already mentioned healing the Fel Rage target. Do you never do ZA? Heroics?<br>
<br>
Frankly, if a shaman didn't have Healing Way, I wouldn't want them in my 25-man raid.</div>

	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>I agree completely that Ancestral Knowledge is a weak talent. If there was a talent that affected mp5 that I could put points in instead I would love to. The general gist of my posts on this issue is that Healing Way can also be a weak talent.<br>
<br>
I think I would probably consider the following the most important healing talents, and I would be suprised to see any pve resto shaman without them: <a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?talent=hZZEc0tVxotcd" target="_blank">Talent Calculator - World of Warcraft</a><br>
<br>
From there, I think it makes sense to buff your survivability and pick up elemental warding and nature's guardian: <a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?talent=hVcZZEc0tVxoted" target="_blank">Talent Calculator - World of Warcraft</a><br>
<br>
That leaves you with 6 points to spread between:<br>
Healing Grace, Focused Mind, Imp Reincarnation, Ancestral Knowledge, or Totemic Focus<br>
<br>
In my view all of these talents are pretty bad and have a fairly limited use:<br>
Healing Grace is useless when threat isn't an issue<br>
Focused Mind is useless when there aren't any silence effects<br>
Imp Reincarnation is useless when you aren't dying<br>
Ancestral Knowledge and Totemic Focus provide a low amount of mana (which is in turn irrelevant if you aren't in a fight where going oom is a concern)<br>
<br>
I don't think there's any clear right answer about what to do with these points. All of the talents have their pros and cons and it's a case of weighing them up in the context of how healing plays out in your raid. <br>
<br>
For example, the other shamans in my guild don't cast healing wave much either, so I wasn't forgetting that healing way is relevant to other shamans. In phase 2 illidan I am mostly casting chain heal on various clumps of people that need healing, as other healers have been specifically assigned to the tanks. Even if I was to cast healing wave on the tanks in phase 2 illidan my main concern is the rest of the raid and there's no guarantee that I would cast another healing wave in time to refresh healing way.<br>
<br>
Mostly in raids I am assigned to "raid healing". This basically consists of throwing around chain heals and lesser healing waves. The cases where I am be assigned to heal a tank are all ones where the tank is in range of people who chain heal can bounce to (eg Gathios.)<br>
<br>
With respect to ZA and Heroics - sure, the value of healing way is different there. However, in my op I noted that I was only talking about 25 man raids. If I have to choose between two talents, the first of which is better in 25 man content and the second is better in the rest, I'll pick the first. And yes, I do ZA and Heroics with and without healing way, and don't feel horribly gimped without it.<br>
<br>
My current spec choice of the "spare" 6 points is:<br>
No Healing Way for reasons stated earlier.<br>
No Healing Grace because I only find threat to be an issue on trash.<br>
No Focused Mind because it's not relevant for enough boss fights.<br>
2/2 Imp Reincarnation because if I do die, I want to increase the chance of surviving straight after ressing.<br>
4/5 Ancestral Knowledge because there are some fights where I find mana is relevant, and as far as I can tell it's better than Totemic Focus. Yes, it's a small amount of mana, but I am weighing it up against what I consider are minimal effects from the other talents.<br>
<br>
This is entirely up to change if my healing role in raids changes. New fights in sunwell with threat or silence mechanics could also make Healing Grace/Focused Mind more desirable.<br>
<br>
<br>
The reason I posted initially was because I wondered if other resto shamans had been having different experiences than me in terms of healing wave use - the answer is quite clearly yes.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>So how much does 40 stam increase your HPS or healing durability potential? That's right: Nothing. Just like enhance shamans, rogues, DD warriors, etc, we have to ensure that we hit &gt;10k buffed for some encounters, but this is something to aim for, not calculate your healing efficiency on. This goes for AC as well. The OP talks about how gear should be tailored for task at hand. This very much goes for stam as well. I used pure stam items in parts of T5 content because I had items like <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30728" target="_blank">[Fathom-Helm of the Deeps]</a>. I didn't <i>need</i> 10k hp buffed in most fights(I can only remember pre-nerfed Solarian).<br>
<br>
Int gives enough benefits to give it a slight value(mana pool, mana gained from MTT, dmg/heal, crit), but spirit is situational. There's not a lot of fights where you don't cast for 5++ seconds and you need a 23 disc priest to have the +heal benefit from it. Stam and AC should be considered just like for enhance shamans, IMO.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Absolutely agreed.  This is even more important for Shamans due to having no instant cast heals for themselves and no Divine Shield and no HoTs to split healing between yourself and other people while repositioning out of AOEs.  Stamina is effective for PvE for the exact same reasons it's effective in PvP, and this is especially true for low-mobility classes.  I'm not going to go out of my way for a ton of stamina through gems or anything, but I'll certainly choose items with stamina in mind (that is, in every slot if possible) and put 18 stamina on my shield instead of a FAR more situational 12 intellect and Boar's Speed on my boots instead of Vitality.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">So how much does 40 stam increase your HPS or healing durability potential? That's right: Nothing. Just like enhance shamans, rogues, DD warriors, etc, we have to ensure that we hit &gt;10k buffed for some encounters, but this is something to aim for, not calculate your healing efficiency on. This goes for AC as well. The OP talks about how gear should be tailored for task at hand. This very much goes for stam as well. I used pure stam items in parts of T5 content because I had items like <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30728" target="_blank">[Fathom-Helm of the Deeps]</a>. I didn't <i>need</i> 10k hp buffed in most fights(I can only remember pre-nerfed Solarian).<br>
<br>
Int gives enough benefits to give it a slight value(mana pool, mana gained from MTT, dmg/heal, crit), but spirit is situational. There's not a lot of fights where you don't cast for 5++ seconds and you need a 23 disc priest to have the +heal benefit from it. Stam and AC should be considered just like for enhance shamans, IMO.</div>

</div>Raut you are in a very strong end game guild. Most of the readers here do not have that luxury. We have missed sheeps, dotted up cc, and take more damage as healers than you do (or did). <br>
<br>
Items have to be rated not only on how they increase heals on paper but also on how they keep you healing. Stamina for most of us is a big part of "is this item an upgrade". Not the biggest part, but important all the same. On boss fights stamina is for the most part not as important to me but on mob pulls it owns. I stay up and we do not have to ress 1/3 of the group. <br>
<br>
You did not need the stamina, but I do so I will keep it having value and suggest for all the other "bads" out there Skyhoof does the same. Where it is at right now is about right imo.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

You have to worry about your buffed hp in some fights, sure. Just as the OP says you should tailor gear for endurance or pure max HPS, you may end up equipping some inferior items to ensure you live to see the end of the fight. But look at the other side of this; When your buffed hp reaches 12k, is stamina still valuable for you? According to the table, it is. I'm arguing that stam should be removed from the table that focuses on <i>healing</i>, just like damage classes don't factor in stam as a damage relative stat.

</div>Agreed, once you reach enough of a stat its value lowers. Even plus to heals becomes mute when you heals are for more than a boss damages. For pure healing efficiency taking stamina off is the way to go but to the new shaman reading this guide for the first time it must be made clear that stamina is a big part of equation. As we get geared and hopefully much more knowledgeable removing stamina from the equation would be totally prudent. For the 90% at my gear level or lower stamina still has a quantitative value though.<br>
<br>
My question is this: How do we impress the value of stamina to budding resto shamans? My answer is to state that an item with 20 stamina but 4 less heals is more valuable than an item with those extra 4 heals and no stamina. The current system does this well. Yours would have this item as inferior which it is not for most shaman.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Nothing wrong with what Raut is suggesting. However, I prefer to give a weight for every stat and then let players discard the stats they don't value. Let me do some rewriting of the text to make it clear that you don't <u>need</u> to use all the stat weights. Often, all I look at on gear is 1) +healing and haste 2) + healing and mp5. You could really toss Intellect out of the stat weights as well. You're going to get a decent mana pool without even trying.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">About the Healing Way discussion: You have to remember that there is a point after which CH is more efficient on a single target than Healing Wave with 3 stacks of Healing Way. Once you reach that point of +healing (which was somewhere above 2k), the only reason to use Healing Wave would be max-rank to put out as much HPS as possible on a single target.<br>
<br>
Once you reach that point, a very good argument could be made for not taking Healing Way and instead putting those points somewhere else.<br>
<br>
I decided to do the math on this, and these are my results. Please check the Math.<br>
<br>
CH 4 on 1 target: Base(648) + +heal*0.71*1.1*1.2*1.05<br>
Manacost of CH 4: 435*0,9*0,95=372 Mana<br>
If you have 2200 + heal, that would mean an average heal of 2813, a HPS on one target of ~1125 and a HPM of 7.56.<br>
<br>
Lets look at what rank of HW is needed in order to achieve the same HPS.<br>
HW has a base multiplier of 0,86*1,18*downranking coefficient. The downranking coefficient I get for HW 8 is 0.86 and for HW 9 is 0.91.<br>
<br>
To get a relatively close HPS number, we would have to use HW 8 (982 HPS) or 9 (1202 HPS).<br>
HW 8: Base(1092) + +heal*0.86*1.18<br>
Manacost of HW 8: 485*0,95=461 Mana<br>
HW 8: Base(1464) + +heal*0.86*1.18<br>
Manacost of HW 9: 615*0,95=584 Mana<br>
<br>
HW 8 would heal for 2455 at a cost of 460.75 Mana for a HPM of 6.52.<br>
HW 9 would heal for 3005 at a cost of 584.25 Mana for a HPM of 6.<br>
<br>
The conclusion: If you have 4T6 and at least 2200 +heal, CH is more mana efficient than HW for healing a single target - even with Healing Way.<br>
<br>
After those results, I decided to take a look at what amount of +heal is needed to make CH more efficient than HW on a single target.<br>
<br>
I made a small spreadsheet in which I entered the calculations, and if I did everything correctly the conclusion is this: if you have 4T6 it is always more efficient to heal a single target with CH than with HW. To have HW be more efficient than CH 4 while achieving the same HPS, you would have to have about 1k +heal. For CH5 the break even point is at about 1700 +heal.<br>
<br>
If you only have 2T6 the break even point is at about 1300 +heal for CH 4, and at a very high number (2800 or so) for CH 5.<br>
<br>
Two things about those results: First of all, they let you appreciate the power of 2T6 and 4T6. Secondly, theylet you appreciate the effectiveness and efficiency of CH4. Thirdly, they show you how inefficient CH5 is.<br>
<br>
Please check my math.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>I belive your conclusiong is right that after you have the 4pc set bonus CH4 is more hpm.  Your math however is wrong! The base gets multiplied by scalers aswell not just the plus healing. CH5 is also not nearly as inefficient as you show.<br>
<br>
You can use the table in the first post and multiply the HPM for CH by 1.05/.9 = 1.167 and see the effect of the 4pc set.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Thanks in advance! (Sry for my bad English)</div>

</div>I dont really think that as such you are meant to ask this type of question here, but i will try to answer it anyway. Keep in mind that you actually outgear me so all of this is from a purely theoretical point of view.<br>
<br>
I believe that before you start looking at haste you should move towards more +healing (until about 2000 at least). Haste, while it increases your hps, increases your mana consumption, and while you are lacking 2pct6 that could hurt.<br>
<br>
As far as what you should spend your badges on, I would personally reccomend either Natural Life Leggings for 75 now, or 100 badges for the legs post-patch. Main hand wise I would be pvp'ing (ie. merc or vengeful salvation if possible). Your boots look pretty solid, the boots, while they are better, are not so much better to be worth 60 badges for you atm, just pick up two-toed sandals from zuljin when convenient.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

The <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=29030" target="_blank">[Cyclone Kilt]</a> is excellent and is, in my opinion, quite a bit better than <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28751" target="_blank">[Heart-Flame Leggings]</a>.  Especially at that gear level.  The former has more stam, more int, more base healing and 11 mp5 while the later has three sockets and ZERO mp5.  Not to mention that having the two piece T4 set bonus adds a nice mp5 boost to your Mana Spring.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_683331"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Spell haste is annoyingly difficult to quantify, especially as it can be amazing on some fights and just good on others.<br>
<br>
I have 4pcT6, 2011 +heal, 174mp5 (unbuffed, no watershield) and ~170 spellhaste rating from gear on my "haste" raid set.  This means 2.2 second casts on chain heal and healing wave, and 1.3 second lesser heals (can't wait for 2.4 and the GCD reduction with haste).   My "normal" raid set boasts 2200 +heal and 200mp5 unbuffed.<br>
<br>
Initially I started testing the haste sets on fights that I knew would benefit from it (Gurtogg, RoS P3) and I've definitely seen an improvement of 5-10% over similarly geared shaman in my guild that run without haste.  Since then, I've expanded my use of haste to cover pretty much every fight, with the exception of Council (I usually heal the Lady Malande tank and interrupt on this fight) and Illidan (this might change in 2.4 as 1.3 secs LHW will be spammable).<br>
<br>
Note that since the WS and MS mana improvements I can happily chaincast through Teron or Gurtogg without a shadow priest and not even using mana pots, while Naj'entus is doable either by chain potting or having an SP.<br>
<br>
Most noticable for me, though, has been the advantage of spellhaste on trash.  The HPS you can pour out with a decent haste set when things go bad is amazing, and I'm sure the combination of passive haste + bloodlust + berserking (meaning &lt;1.5 secs CH!) has saved a wipe on more than one occasion.<br>
<br>
The only issue for me has been the time I wiped us on Gurtogg by out-agroing the tanks!  Salvation is a must for a hasted CH shaman <!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
That is a lot of badges but that's also a lot of extra healing, and it's not like heroics are hard to run when you're not doing kara/za. With a tank above 13k HP and a healer above 1500 healing you can do pretty much any heroic with great ease, especially the easier ones like slave pens (that also drops 11 heal 2 mp5 gems that will no longer be unique in 2.4) and mechanar. You don't even really need CC. There is really no excuse not to have that gear, which you could've easily found yourself by using wowhead (heck most of it is badge gear you could find it by talking to geras in shattrath...).<br>
<br>
Do you *need* haste? You don't need anything really this game is easy enough. But if you want to do your best in some fights haste items are better than in others, depending on your need for efficiency (which haste has very little effect on) as opposed to your need for high HPS burst to top people off quickly. That's why everyone keep arguing about haste - the answer is simply "it depends on the fight" (and a few other things).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_690611"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Remember haste HPS &gt; healing HPS &gt; mp5 HPS = 0<br>
For most people MP5 efficiency &gt;= +healing efficiency &gt; haste efficiency &gt;= 0<br>
<br>
+healing increases efficiency as it allows you to heal more with the same mana. mp5 increases efficiency as it allows you to cast more heals. Healing also increases (burst) HPS while mp5 doesn't.<br>
<br>
Since the loss of efficiency (if even a loss at all) of gemming healing over mp5 is quite small, but the loss of efficiency by gemming haste is big, for general purpose gear healing is the best gemming choice. You're losing some noticeable HPS by not socketing haste but when efficiency is an issue you're losing very little and socketing mp5 would cause you to lose a lot more HPS in burst situations than you lose by socketing +healing.<br>
<br>
If you could get 2 sets then obviously socket 1 with healing (or mp5) and the other with haste, but that's probably not going to happen anytime soon, so <b>if you're not 100% sure wether you'll need HPS a lot more than efficiency or the other way around, or you know you'll need both about equally, then +healing would be the best thing to socket.</b> If an item happens to have a lot of haste and horrible efficiency (for example the ZA haste neck if it had sockets), though, socketing with haste is not a bad idea, as you would only wear it when HPS is much more important than efficiency in which haste gems are by far better.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>To clarify that is true per point but not (always) true in itemization cost.  In the example of 10 haste or 22 healing it depends on how much healing and how much haste you have as to which is more HPS.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_690796"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->You're right. Assuming the 125% coefficient spread on all the heals, with 2k +healing you will gain more rank5 CH HPS by using your itemization on healing.

For MT healing though, with HW/LWH that gets a realistic coefficients, haste would increase HPS by more than +healing would. It's probably not worth the efficiency sacrifice in most/all fights though, not to mention how rarely you're on MT healing anyway.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>As you can see in the example 100 haste can be greater than 220 healing in HPS increase.  I'd say the sweet spot is in the 100 &lt; X &lt; 200 haste range for a fully decked sunwell resto shaman.  However if you don't already have 100 haste on your gear haste could very well be a larger HPS increase than +heal.   This is why we have stat weights and only can make generalization about very specific gear.  Haste is a percent increase and therefore scales with healing it also has dimished returns as you stack more meaning its about a balance between the 2. Not to mention haste has a greater affect vs healing on our other heals although we don't use them more than 10% of the time on average.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_690938"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->The point is since haste would need to be a noticeable HPS addition over +healing to be worth the efficiency sacrifice. Say if 10 haste with a certain gear level would give HPS equal to the HPS achieved by +25 healing, you'd be giving up 22 healing worth of efficiency for 3 healing worth of HPS. This would require you to be extremely overflowing with mana to even think about it and even then you'd probably not take it.<br>
<br>
The fact the HPS is compareable between haste and +healing is what makes it bad. For haste to be something to consider to increase HPS, it needs to be noticeably higher HPS per itemization budget than +healing. This just doesn't happen for chain heal although it does happen for other spells that have a more "standard" coefficient.<br>
<br>
Of course this is saying nothing about MP5 vs haste, as on that comparison you're giving up pure efficiency for pure HPS, in which case HPS can win if the fight requires it more than it requires efficiency.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">The point is since haste would need to be a noticeable HPS addition over +healing to be worth the efficiency sacrifice. Say if 10 haste with a certain gear level would give HPS equal to the HPS achieved by +25 healing, you'd be giving up 22 healing worth of efficiency for 3 healing worth of HPS. This would require you to be extremely overflowing with mana to even think about it and even then you'd probably not take it.</div>

</div>No the point is you can now socket yellow gems and not loose HPS meaning that in some cases you can pickup socket bonuses by using haste gems instead of only using red 22 healing gems and ignoring socket bonuses.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>The actual efficiency increase from haste is actually rather small if you do the math. Say you cast only CH5 for simplification, with HPM5/HPS5 and HPM4/HPS4 being the HPM/HPS of CH5 and CH4,<br>
<br>
You will need HPS5/HPS4-1 haste (*1570 to convert to rating) to turn all the CH5s to CH4s, increasing your mana efficiency by HPM4/HPM5-1. If you do the math spending the same itemization you would on haste on something like +healing and just staying with CH5 your efficiency would grow more (I expect the amount of haste rating required to be quite high).<br>
<br>
In other words, you can see the efficiency increase by downranking all your spells to CH4 and then calculate how much +healing (or MP5) is needed to get CH5 the same efficiency increase. This will also apply when mixing CH5s and CH4s and adding small amounts of haste thus convering a small amount of CH5s to CH4s gaining a small amount of efficiency - the idea and the numbers you'd get is the same as the simplified calculation above.<br>
<br>
If you're already at looking at HPS-&gt;efficiency conversions, keep in mind +healing also increases HPS on top of the HPM increase and thus also allows more downranking and thus even *more* efficiency. Since +healing increases HPS by similar levels as haste per itemization, it'll give about the same HPS-&gt;efficiency as haste (which wouldn't be a huge value) and on top give it's normal HPM increase (which would be the main part of the efficiency increase).<br>
<br>
So even while haste does increase efficiency slightly, +healing will always increase it more, both due to adding HPM and by adding about the same HPS. Even on other (non-chainheal non-CoH) spells where healing adds quite lower HPS than haste does, the combined HPS-&gt;efficiency and HPM significantly beats the HPS-&gt;efficiency of haste.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_691947"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I've made a little spreadsheet for shammy healing.<br>
I understand that everyone has his own spreadsheet for healing spells, but i discovered that some formulaes at wowwiki are incorrect, even based on blueposts. So i hope my spreadsheet may be useful for some1 just because there are checked numbers.<br>
<br>
I've got Draezele's 'Shaman Healing Efficiency' spreadsheet, checked it, tested, removed mistakes and modified.<br>
<br>
<b>Original article + spreadsheet: </b><br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080401213246/http://files.filefront.com/Shaman+Healing+Efficiencyxls/;9094141;/fileinfo.html" target="_blank">Draezele's Spreadsheet</a><br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080401213246/http://resto4now.blogspot.com/2007/11/mana-efficiency.html" target="_blank">Draezele's Article</a><br>
<br>
<b>My spreadsheet </b>(without macros, pure XLS):<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080401213246/http://www.divshare.com/download/4134025-c5c" target="_blank">RestoShammySpells_v240_20080330.zip</a><br>
<br>
RestoShammySpells.xls calculates Avg.Healed, HPS, HPM, MP5 spent for each valuable shammy's heal.<br>
In addition the real HPS depending on current MP5/Manapool/Time of fight calculated for each spell.<br>
<br>
Sheets:<br>
'Notes' - just notes ^^<br>
'HPM;HPS' - complex table for calculating HPS, HPM, Avg.Healing and other<br>
'2.4 check' - results of checking spells after patch 2.4<br>
'Coeff' - table for different kinds of scaling HPS/+healing, HPM/+healing<br>
'HS/ES coeff' - experimantal data and calculations of coefficients for Healing Stream and Earth Shield<br>
'DR coeff' - just table of right downranking penalties<br>
<br>
All formulaes and coefficients were checked by series of ingame experiments.<br>
The method was based on minimal/maximal amount healed by spell.<br>
<br>
For example:<br>
I have formulae for Lesser Healing Wave Rank2. I calculate minimal and maximal amount healed [744.4;782.9]<br>
I reset data in Recap addon and start using LHW2 on myself, Recap shows me minimal and maximal heals from this test. If formulae is incorrect real values dont match theoretical ones. If its right real values are in the theoretical bracket. In my case real values are [745;783]. So i make a decision that formulae are right.<br>
<br>
<b>Note1:</b><br>
Downranking penalties at wowwiki are incorrect. And original blizzard posts are incorrect too.<br>
<font size="3"><b><font color="Sienna">([Level at which next higher rank of Spell is Learned] + 5) / [Character Level] = [Downranking Coefficient]<br>

</div>I have known about the healing stream coef for awhile. It is  6% a tick but thats after talents.  The base is about 4.4% in my calculations I use 4.3636.  I have not done any in game testing since 2.4.  Interesting data though I'll have to check against my calculations in game to verify but last I checked my healing wave calculations seemed right except for those learned below lvl 20 I just never got around to fixing.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I would consider whether Nature's Guardian will help you survive more than Elemental Warding. This could come down to whether you are more prone to stand in fires or pull healing aggro on trash. However, if you want Elemental Warding and instant Ghost Wolf, your spec is solid. In fact, I think I'll put a link to it on the first page.<br>
<br>
EDIT: Here's what I will probably use when I go back to resto. I like the threat reduction because I am always healing Kara and 5-man with someone's alt tank in blues. <a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?talent=hZx0bZEf0tieoted" target="_blank"><br>

</div>Its possible ofc, but i dont have T6 yet, so it will be unchecked data. Actually i think my spreadsheed is pretty casual and dont have something new in comparison with Daidalos' one. I made it just because i dont like unchecked data.<br>
My 1st priorities now is check relics and intend in the spreadsheet, add 'on use' thingies, and may be develop some sheme for valuation HealingWay uptime when we dont spam HW.<br>
<br>
P.S. The most interesting fact for me was Earth Shield mechanics. When it's applied to myself it's affected by Purification, when ES applied to tank it isn't affected by Purification.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

It's only been a few hours of raiding since then, but I've been observing that Mana Restore procs 2-3 times more frequently than Healing Trance.  We're only talking 100s not 1000s of casts, but the numbers do appear close to 2% for the Eye and 5% for the Diamond, based on the "Hits" column in WWS which I believe will count each jump of CH.  Just some data for proc rate debates and the TODO in the original post.<br>

</div>Alot of testing with very high amounts of +healing.  I haven't been as comprehensive as you have though and I am using wowwiki forumas for the most part.  Yeah the purification for ES is one of those "gotchas"  For my calculations I assumed it was .3 coef I'm curious that your testing seems to indicate it being a little lower.  Basically I'm very glad someone is doing this since I keep meaning to then get distracted.  Flame shock and healing stream gave me fits trying to fix thier coefs.  I'm still not entirely happy with my flame shock coef but I think they are close now.<br>
<br>
As for excel format you can just export from gdocs and save as .xls  it will work with both Open office and excel.  If that doesn't work I can email the .xls sheets to you.  I work out of excel but I try to keep the gdocs updated.<br>
<br>
Anyways great work boko I'm def interested in fixing any coefs where applicable.  I can also get up to 3k +healing when trinketed for testing coefs which is kinda handy :-p<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

	</tbody></table>
</div>I picked up one of these last Tuesday as well (I've seen it drop 3 times and still no <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=34472" target="_blank">[Shard of Contempt]</a>  ), and have been playing with it for a while.  I made a post on my own guild's forums with some information I've garnered from personal testing.  Some of the points refer to what I've read about the way the trinket worked on the PTR.<br>
<br>
1) The max range on the heal is 40 yards, not 10.<br>
2) The heal does not pop a GCD, so you can hit it quickly between casts for a truly free extra (instant!) heal.  Effectively gives shaman a second instant-heal on a 2 min CD.<br>
3) The stacking Holy Energy buff never fades. It doesn't have a timer. You keep the stacks indefinitely until you use them, even if you change gear, log out, zone (don't know about zoning into arena), etc. If you swap the trinket out, you keep the buff, and can use it after you re-equip it (after the standard 30 second wait for any use ability).<br>
4) You can use the heal while silenced.  It saved our ass on a bad silence on a very healer-light Gruul yesterday.<br>
5) It cannot be spell stolen. I assume this means it also can't be purged, but I don't know about Mass Dispel.<br>
6) It only seems to stack when casting direct heals and HoTs. Casting Earth Shield doesn't increase the stack, nor do the charges of Earth Shield when they go off. My guess is that things like Power Word: Shield also won't increase stacks.<br>
7) The healing done is increased by Fel Armor and the rogue talent. I assume this means it's also subject to being decreased by things like MS, Wound Poison, etc., as you'd expect.<br>
8) It can crit, and crits for 1.5x like all other heals.  Unsurprisingly, the crit rate seems to be independent of your spell crit rate, though a holy paladin would probably be better equipped to confirm this than me.<br>
<br>
Ultimately, I think the biggest arguments in favor of this trinket are #2 and #4, and I equip it on any fight where it's likely that I'll need an "oh crap" heal.  I will occasionally swap it out for a passive +heal trinket, but I really like the utility of the instant-heal this trinket provides.<br>
<br>
[e] Note that even if the stack doesn't stay when you zone into arena, it only takes 20 seconds to build up the full stack of 20 charges, as the GCD on rank 1 HW is 1.0 sec now.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I tried to check if this value (4.3636%) corresponds with my experimental data and found that it doesn't.<br>
<br>
A little example:<br>
<br>
HST was dropped with +2299 HealingBonus.<br>
I see ticks for 163 and 164. So actual tick value is contained in the [163.0;164.0] range.<br>
<br>
Calculate now scaling coefficient for lower and upper limits of interval.<br>
<br>
TickBonus = Tick / ( PurificationCoeff * RestorativeTotemCoeff ) - 18;<br>
ScalingCoeff = TickBonus/HealingBonus = ( Tick / ( PurificationCoeff * RestorativeTotemCoeff ) - 18 ) / HealingBonus ;<br>
<br>
ScalingCoeffLo = ( 163 / ( 1.25 * 1.1 ) - 18 ) / 2299 = 4.3734%<br>
ScalingCoeffHi = ( 164 / ( 1.25 * 1.1 ) - 18 ) / 2299 = 4.4051%<br>
<br>
So actual scaling coefficient are in [ 4.3734%; 4.4051%] interval. And 4.3636% isn't contained in this interval.<br>
These calculations can be seen in the new version of spreadsheet (at 'HS coeff' sheet): <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080403083820/http://www.divshare.com/download/4146790-c73" target="_blank">DivShare File - RSSss_v101.zip</a><br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I picked up one of these last Tuesday as well (I've seen it drop 3 times and still no <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=34472" target="_blank">[Shard of Contempt]</a>  ), and have been playing with it for a while.  I made a post on my own guild's forums with some information I've garnered from personal testing.  Some of the points refer to what I've read about the way the trinket worked on the PTR.<br>
<br>
1) The max range on the heal is 40 yards, not 10.<br>
2) The heal does not pop a GCD, so you can hit it quickly between casts for a truly free extra (instant!) heal.  Effectively gives shaman a second instant-heal on a 2 min CD.<br>
3) The stacking Holy Energy buff never fades. It doesn't have a timer. You keep the stacks indefinitely until you use them, even if you change gear, log out, zone (don't know about zoning into arena), etc. If you swap the trinket out, you keep the buff, and can use it after you re-equip it (after the standard 30 second wait for any use ability).<br>
4) You can use the heal while silenced.  It saved our ass on a bad silence on a very healer-light Gruul yesterday.<br>
5) It cannot be spell stolen. I assume this means it also can't be purged, but I don't know about Mass Dispel.<br>
6) It only seems to stack when casting direct heals and HoTs. Casting Earth Shield doesn't increase the stack, nor do the charges of Earth Shield when they go off. My guess is that things like Power Word: Shield also won't increase stacks.<br>
7) The healing done is increased by Fel Armor and the rogue talent. I assume this means it's also subject to being decreased by things like MS, Wound Poison, etc., as you'd expect.<br>
8) It can crit, and crits for 1.5x like all other heals.  Unsurprisingly, the crit rate seems to be independent of your spell crit rate, though a holy paladin would probably be better equipped to confirm this than me.<br>
<br>
Ultimately, I think the biggest arguments in favor of this trinket are #2 and #4, and I equip it on any fight where it's likely that I'll need an "oh crap" heal.  I will occasionally swap it out for a passive +heal trinket, but I really like the utility of the instant-heal this trinket provides.<br>
<br>
[e] Note that even if the stack doesn't stay when you zone into arena, it only takes 20 seconds to build up the full stack of 20 charges, as the GCD on rank 1 HW is 1.0 sec now.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I tried to check if this value (4.3636%) corresponds with my experimental data and found that it doesn't.<br>
<br>
A little example:<br>
<br>
HST was dropped with +2299 HealingBonus.<br>
I see ticks for 163 and 164. So actual tick value is contained in the [163.0;164.0] range.<br>
<br>
Calculate now scaling coefficient for lower and upper limits of interval.<br>
<br>
TickBonus = Tick / ( PurificationCoeff * RestorativeTotemCoeff ) - 18;<br>
ScalingCoeff = TickBonus/HealingBonus = ( Tick / ( PurificationCoeff * RestorativeTotemCoeff ) - 18 ) / HealingBonus ;<br>
<br>
ScalingCoeffLo = ( 163 / ( 1.25 * 1.1 ) - 18 ) / 2299 = 4.3734%<br>
ScalingCoeffHi = ( 164 / ( 1.25 * 1.1 ) - 18 ) / 2299 = 4.4051%<br>
<br>
So actual scaling coefficient are in [ 4.3734%; 4.4051%] interval. And 4.3636% isn't contained in this interval.<br>
These calculations can be seen in the new version of spreadsheet (at 'HS coeff' sheet): <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080403083820/http://www.divshare.com/download/4146790-c73" target="_blank">DivShare File - RSSss_v101.zip</a><br>

Could you post your HST ticks values for 3k+ healing bonuses?</div>

There is incorrect scaling coefficient (30%). Real is 28.6% per tick.<br>
<br>
<b>Note4:</b><br>
28.03.2008 Corrected Earth Shield in the tables due to changes in 2.4 patch.<br>
I've discovered that Blizzard changed coefficient for ES Rank1. Old one was 28.6%, new one is 26.55% per tick ((<br>
<font size="2"><b>It seems Blizzard applied downranking penalty to ES1 as to lvl54 spell. And didnt tip it in patchnotes, hehe </b></font><br>

I hope it can be useful for someone. Thnx 4 attention.</div>

</div>I did some testing last night with 2784+healing and purification talent and I got 979 earth shield ticks on myself.<br>
<br>
So assuming <br>
(150+X*2784)*1.1 = 979<br>
solving for x I got .2685 however this is including the down ranking penalty<br>
assuming that the wowwikki downranking is correct ES r2 is learned at<br>
lvl 60 making making ES r1 a lvl 65 spell in effect<br>
<br>
so (65/70)C = .2658<br>
solving for c we get .28625<br>
<br>
Seems that the coef is the same perhaps the level learned+11 is wrong?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I personally found Kalecgos a very very good test of 'skills', partially due to our tactics as well. (4 pre set groups, means that at a certain point your healers need to be very aware of where the other healers are or the tank is left with 0 healers)<br>
<br>
Council was a nice test of environmental awareness, the points where illidan goes wrong and your raid has to reposition completely (like a tank going for a trap on the grid) and in general any fight where a healer has to make a call of who to prioritise. <br>
I know that for shamans this is less the case then for paladins, but for paladins you can see a very clear difference in 5 mans when alot of people are taking damage. Deciding who to heal first based on factors such as 'can he survive on his own' 'how vital to the groups survival is he' can make a very big difference.<br>
<br>
Besides kalecgos, you can say in general: "when fights go really wrong". Brutallus with too many burns up, etc.<br>
<br>
One thing that sometimes tells me a shaman is on autopilot is seeing him throw a max rank CH on someone who doesn't even have anyone close to him. (a good UI and a general 'feeling' of where most people are helps alot)<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_700727"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->For shamans, I've seen quite a few fail at solo healing the priest's tank on fathom lord where lesser geaered shamans succeeded. You only need 1 healer there that can also earthshock the heals. While you can have a rogue help (which you'll need either rogue for mind numbing or lock for CoTongues to make the heal slow enough to interrupt), the rogue can get frozen or get the kick missed (or at least dodged even if hit capped) so you still need to be on top of interrupts while keeping the tank, yourself and the rogue/lock up. It's not actually that hard but I've experienced a couple healers that simply couldn't handle it.<br>
<br>
I can't think of many other fights where you can actually see wether a healer is good or not, but just about any fight that requires avoiding taking damage while doing your normal healing/dps can tell you who's gkick material and who's a core group material. Recount helps (or at least did before 2.4) a lot with its "death meters" showing you the last 8-12s or so before the person's death so you see exactly what killed him and who healed him which tells you what damage he didn't avoid and/or who didn't heal him that might've been supposed to be healing. A good example for this is seeing who died to whirlwind (although that shows easily enough on your raidframes) and who gets hit by a strider on vashj P2 (which is another thing you should stay away from and never hit by), or worse - flame patches on al'ar and poison clouds on vashj P3.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>There are two healing intensive encounters BT: Najentus and Bloodboil. Both favor carpet healing, so shamans have it easy there, at least for topping the meters. Then there's Rage Winterchill, which is trivial, but going through it without a single loss to ice bolt isn't, at least in the beginning. Council also does some separation, but it separates people who know how to stand outside of bad things from those that can't.<br>
<br>
But personally, I was stressed the most when we were learning Vashj. I was healing tanks and melee and was always borderline OOM even when chaining resto drums and potions with Alch. Stone. I was also quite new to healing, having switched my main two months ago. Gear didn't help, as it was mostly Kara with an odd blue and T6 LW shoulders. I learned more about WoW during that period than ever.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Yes I have looked at it. 4 stam 5 int and 2mp5 isn't nearly as good as 8 haste.  Overall its a good ring though and since we have stopped doing BT for awhile I'm considering it but a pure HPS comparison Karabor is certainly superior.  Again go off your own experiences we only had 2 resto shaman for our brut kill last night and I spammed CH5 for 5mins and 35s.  With a shadow preist in my group I only had time for 1 mana tide (blowing Mana tide earlier wouldn't have helped much since I was over 90% mana) and only had to pot once at the very end.  I can't really imagine a more mana stressing situation so at this point mp5 is of very little value to me.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>AFAIK the Aldor proc has an internal cooldown of 45 seconds, so we can probably assume it having a effective 1 proc per minute.<br>
<br>
In other words, +200 healing for 10 sec every 60 seconds. Which gives us averagely +33 healing over 60 seconds.<br>
<br>
So its 70+33-&gt; <br>
<br>
103 healing, 7 mana/5 and 19 stam <br>

<br>
82 healing, 33 spell haste, 360 mana and 19 spirit (and 0.3% spell crit *yay*)<br>

What is better really depends what you rather need. <br>
If running out of mana and hitpoint buffer are no issue, but outhealing incoming damage is the Brooch is better. It has the bigger healing boost, but is worse for endurance fights.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

When you convert the proc on <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=29309" target="_blank">[Band of the Eternal Restorer]</a> to a static amount of +healing, the Eternal Restorer looks better on paper than <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32528" target="_blank">[Blessed Band of Karabor]</a>.

Until the Glimmering Naaru Sliver drops, we’re going with the assumption that you won’t be able to move or cast while channeling. We’re also assuming the channeling can be interrupted. Based on those assumptions, it’s not one of the best trinkets. However, if it simply restores mana over 8 seconds, it would be right up there with the <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=35750" target="_blank">[Redeemer's Alchemist Stone]</a> and far superior to <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33828" target="_blank">[Tome of Diabolic Remedy]</a>.<br>

Depends if you want more HPS or more efficiency, really, which as already said depends on the fight and raid/party composition, so your question (or others of that kind) doesn't really have a definite answer, at least not one that would be independant of the fight and raid/party composition.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_705490"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I think the issue at hand is +healing procs are unpredicatable.  You can say they're up 15-20% of the time and worth +XXX amount of healing on average, but unlike "clicky" trinkets like Diabolic Remedy, you can't count on them to be there when you most need them. <br>
<br>
In short, it's all about control.  I'd prefer to be in control of how big and how fast my heals are (ie. different spell ranks and spell haste).  If I know a burst is incoming and extra healing is needed (say a boss enrages, or Brutallus is going to stomp and a healer is moving out for burn), I'll up my ranks and or swap to HW or something.  I'm not going to pray that my scarab of infinite cycle or my ring's going to proc at that time to save us.  I'd prefer not to go around spamming a lower rank spell hoping my ring proc's a ton to make it heal more.<br>
<br>
In that regard, I pretty much treat those proc's the same as I'd treat spell crit.  They're nice, but they're unpredictable and more or less just a bonus.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_705529"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->A +healing proc is about the same kind of effectiveness as the +healing portion of crit (ignoring the armor bonus) - it'll add to your average HP/mana healed and average HPS (and thus using slightly less mana by being more efficient with more HPS), but it will <b>not</b> help your reliable max burst to save someone from dying, as like crit there's a good chance it won't be up when needed. So the procs only help efficiency with the averaged value but don't add to burst HPS.<br>
<br>
On use healing is different as it can be used on burst situations but can't always be used on all of them, so its usefullness for burst is fight-dependant. Generally if you heal bursts very often though the burst HPS increase of on-use trinkets isn't really there as like procs it'll often not be up when needed (but still give the efficiency increase). If you're needing burst very rarely you'll be quite likely to have it available making it more useful. Plus a 120 +healing on use has a lot more burst than constant 20 +healing if you can actually use it every time a burst is needed, but that's a pretty big "if".<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_706323"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I'm sorry Galzohar but i have to disagree with you.  <br>
<br>
Smart use trinkets (whlie i only spoke of burst use, but whatever) are based on the idea that X+healing for Y seconds will more useful at a time in the future (t+n) rather than now (t+0). If n&gt; than the CD of the trinket you have lost efficiency (with n being cumulative for the duration of the encounter, until n=cd then it starts over).<br>
<br>
While in many cases bosses issue periodic burst damage to tanks or the raid; in other cases, such as parry strings, the exact timing of the danger is unforeseeable, and in fact may not occur. When trying to predict future events there is always some risk and the further one projects the wider the margin of error becomes. If you save your trinket use for parry a string that never comes was that efficient use? <br>
<br>
Additionally there is the risk that at time (t+n+Y) the use of the trinket may have been more beneficial and one faces this possibility up to (t+n+cd), at which point the cycle starts over. If you used your trinket to get though a raid wide aoe rather than the parry string 20 seconds later, was that smart use?<br>
<br>
When playing like this one risks average efficiency for periodic burst efficiency at what is hopefully a critical juncture. While  I'm not condemning this play style by any means, i use it myself, there is no doubt that some risk is involved. While one can minimize this risk via smart play, in any game with even minimal risk play enough times and you guaranteed lose some iterations.<br>
<br>
This means that smart use trinket style while usually the correct play are not always guaranteed to be as good use on every cool down. As i stated above when playing this way you reduce the average HEP value of the trinket on use ability somewhat, and this should be considered in gear comparisons.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_706407"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Think about it this way - you say you lose from delaying the trinket, then why don't you just use it now and don't lose anything?<br>
If it's better used later than using now, it's better to use later than to use now, and therefore using it later would be better than using it now....<br>
If it isn't then just repeat that line replacing "better" with "not better".<br>
<br>
In other words since nobody stops you from using the trinket whenever it's up, I'm assuming that if you choose to use it in any other way it's because you decided it is better to do so (which starts the loop again...).<br>
<br>
Therefore you can never (at least on average) gain from a trinket less than what you would've gotten if you used it on every cooldown. The only thing you can lose is efficiency while gaining HPS but if you chose to do that then it's probably a net benefit (which brings me to the loop again).<br>
<br>
You can't say that becuase it's better to use it later is a good idea, then the trinket loses value. You're just making a logical contradiction.<br>
<br>
I know saying "at least" and "on average" in the same sentence is confusing, but what I mean by "at least" is actually "if we theorycraft its average value we will get at least", not that it's always better no matter how dice roll - as dice always cause a variance but we ignore that since it's small enough for anything that isn't a burst calculation (and I already mentioned how the effectiveness of such trinkets for burst purposes varies a lot depending on the fight).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Please stop rambling. We like to see numbers to back up an argument. I believe this is what Vistol is trying to explain to you.<br>
<br>
Let's say you have <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=29376" target="_blank">[Essence of the Martyr]</a>. If you use this trinket every time the cooldown is up, it grants you another 49.5 healing (297*20/120). However, if you save the trinket for more dicey situations, the +healing you get from it is diminished. If you use the trinket every four minutes, it only grants you another 24.75 +healing. If you use trinkets in this way, you need to lower the HEP value of the item so you can accurately compare it with items that have a passive effect.<br>
<br>
So is it worth using a trinket every 4 minutes instead of every 2 minutes? Only if you will cast at least twice as many heals by saving it. For example, it could be worth saving a trinket to use during Bloodlust/Heroism or with a haste potion rather than using it exactly when the cooldown is available. <br>
<br>
It could also be worth saving a trinket to supercharge a Healing Stream totem for use in certain fights.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_706479"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->At the end you always have the choice of using it on every cooldown, in which case you would get the numbers you listed. If you think you're not benefiting as much by not using it on every cooldown, use it on every cooldown. If you think you benefit more from not using it on every cooldown, use it when you think it's useful. Either way it's not possible to (on average) gain less than using it on every cooldown, due to always having the option to do so.<br>
<br>
Let's say we have a raid wide silence every around 1 minute that lasts 20 seconds. If I used the trinket randomly, I would lose 1/3 of the effect, but I would also lose 1/3 of the effect of normal +healing, therefore the trinket is as good as the calculated value. If I was smart and calculated the chance for a silence to make me lose value and use it in a better way, I could increase my average gain from the trinket. But assuming I don't do something stupid, on average, I will get from the trinket its 49.5 healing. If it ended up using it ever 2min10s on average but avoiding coliding it with all silences, while I only gained ~95% of the effect but the rest of my gear is still worth only 2/3, so the trinket is effectively as good as ~143% of the effect (~128 +healing averaged). Of course this is an extreme example of being silenced 1/3 of the time but I hope the idea is clear enough.<br>
<br>
Now if using it every more than 2 minutes causes you to actually lose average effectiveness, you just resort to using it on every cooldown. This means smart-using trinkets is at least as good as popping them on-cooldown, as in the worst case for the trinket the smart thing to do will be to use it whenever it's up and gaining the 49.5 healing on average.<br>
<br>
The only way you'd lose efficiency is if you saved the trinket to help in burst scenarios, but that simply means you decided burst scenarios are more important to you than your efficiency and that the tradeoff was worth it, and therefore saving it for burst scenario is worth it. If you think it isn't worth it, again, just use it on every cooldown and gain the 49.5 healing on average.<br>
<br>
Calculating the actual efficiency increase from the essence of the martyr is complicated buisness, but assuming smart play it'll increase your efficiency by at least as much as 49.5 healing would, unless you decided to trade it off for burst if you thought that was more crucial in which case you stil benefited more than increasing your efficiency by 49.5 healing equivalent by definition.<br>
<br>
Again, the bottom line is that <b>the worst way to use the trinket is mindlessly mashing it every cooldown which would give you the average effect of 49.5 healing increase to your efficiency (not reliable burst, though, as it wouldn't be reliable in this case). Anything else would be either same or a better use of it.</b><!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Your basis for this argument is extremely weak -- a raidwide silence every 1 minute that lasts for 20 seconds. This would be an extreme situation and not the normal way shaman heal in raids. In most fights, shaman spam Chain Heal. Because the amount of healing done is fairly constant, trinkets should be used at every cooldown. If you want to use the trinket less frequently, you must drastically increase the number of heals cast when the trinket is used. The only way to do this is with Bloodlust/Heroism, which is on a 10-minute cooldown.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

And bad evaluation due to player error means the player should value his uses better, not that the trinket is not as good.<br>
<br>
Skyhoof, the point is you simply can't bring up a scenario where the average benefit of the trinket will be less than an efficiency gain of 49.5 healing. Wether you can get a little more than that, a lot more than that, or anything like that was not my point. My point is that you will on average gain no less than efficiency value of 49.5 healing unless you intentionally use it poorly, and the only way to lose efficiency is if you decide to save it for burst in which case you decided is a benefit so you can't count it against the trinket. I'm not saying in practice you'll get a lot more than that, or even anything more, but you'll definitely not get less, at least on average.<br>
<br>
At the end my main point is that you can't use something in a way that's supposed to be better and then use that as a claim against its usefullness. The usefullness is at least an efficiency increase of 49.5 healing, and every situation you'll come up with I'll show you that the trinket was at least as good as that, as long as you don't <b>intentionally </b>use it badly.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

You are addressing this as a binary set of choices ie do, or do not. With at worst ending up with spam usage. However due to uncertainty about future conditions it's more like a matrix (in fact the prisoners dilemma comes to mind). Proper independent conservative play reduces risk to you without knowledge of what the other actor (the RNG) will do yielding a set of non-optimal circumstances that are correct choices.<br>

</div>The reason this discussion is getting silly is becuase I don't see what's so hard to understand.<br>
<br>
I never suggested what would be optimal use for a trinket, that obviously depends on the fight. What I was saying is that the 49.5 healing efficiency-wise is the worst you would get from it in a given fight. If you waiting for a period of increased damage is better than using it on every cooldown, then you agree it's worth more than just something that adds 49.5 healing to your efficiency? If you don't agree then it's not better and then you will use it on every cooldown and gain that value I listed.<br>
<br>
<b>No matter how you look at it, there is no scenario you can think of where the trinket is worse than gaining 49.5 healing on average efficiency-wise.</b><br>
<br>
Why would you wait and use the trinket only every 4 minutes if it causes on average more harm than good? The only reason I can think of is if you absolutely need it to cover a burst, in which case it would help a lot more than some extra efficiency since the burst healing gained on that rare occasion is obviously more important to you than 49.5 healing on average to your efficiency. If it's not more important to you and you think 49.5 healing on average to your efficiency is better, then nothing is stopping you from getting that value. <b>Since nothing prevents you from gaining that, there is no situation in which you can claim the trinket is less valueable than that.</b><br>
<br>
<br>
I think the best way to make you understand what I'm saying is to ask you to bring a situation where the average benefit from the trinket is less than what I claim to be the minimum.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Just because his/her mana may be full doesn't mean they should keep it off cooldown, watch the rest of the group too.<br>

Hellcat and Arcaris don't use the insightful earthstorm diamond.  They missed out on about 30k extra mana regen because of that over the course of the instance, to put that into perspective it is 15% of the mana that the shadow priest gave them for the night.<br>

		<div id="post_message_706910"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Much of this argument seems to be coming down to semantics concerning maximum theoretical gain and actual gain.<br>
<br>
The maximum possible +healing of a trinket with an on-use function is the sum of the static +heal and the average +heal gained from the on-use, assuming that you pop it every time it comes off cooldown. There's no arguing this.<br>
<br>
The actual gain varies greatly, being influenced by a wide variety of factors including the magnitude of damage being taken, the number of healers in the raid, how much effective healing your heal will actually do, and so on. What these all tie into is how much healing you're actually going to be doing when the trinket is popped. Assuming you've just used your Essence of the Martyr, what influence does the amounnt of healing you do have on the trinket's worth? If you cast six heals that are 100% effective healing as opposed to three, it's clear that the on-use would give you double the benefit.<br>
<br>
Essence of the Martyr on-use: +297<br>
Benefit for Healing Wave: +254.6<br>
<br>
Extra healing done, 6 heals cast: 1527.6<br>
Extra healing done, 3 heals cast: 763.8<br>
<br>
In the first scenario, the on-use's overall worth is definitely more than that of the second. Because the number of heals you're going to cast is going to dependent on a whole hell of a lot of factors that aren't under your control, the benefit you're going to see from the Essence can vary widely over encounters, and even specific instances of those encounters. For example, what if that healing boost was enough to save a player (usually the MT) whose dying would cause a wipe? The trinket's worth would be immense as far as raid success goes, yet the actual +heal gain would be relatively small if you had only casted a few heals. You may not see a huge +heal bonus out of not constantly popping a trinket, but the overall worth may be greater. This point, I think, is the one that Galzohar was trying to make but failed, instead arguing that you could glean more than an average +49.5 healing (you can't).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_706954"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Again, you're saying random factors can hurt this, but at the end every scenario you bring, from efficiency conerns the <b>average </b> benefit from the trinket when used properly will never be less than 49.5. In other words in a real fight you're more likely to benefit from it more than a simple 49.5 healing increase than you are to benefit less (aka average&gt;=49.5). On every fight scenario you give me I can calculate the average benefit the trinket will give to you and every time it'll be at least 49.5 healing worth for efficiency.<br>
<br>
If the trinket stopped a wipe, it's definitely better than a static 49.5 healing increase. In that scenario the trinket's value is greater than the average minimum, which works with what I was saying.<br>
<br>
Regarding casting 6 heals vs casting 3 heals, it depends what you were doing for the rest of the fight. I don't disagree that bad luck can make you at the end look back and say "crap I got little from that trinket". But this will actually happen less often than saying "this trinket was better than 49.5 bonus to my efficiency", if given the fight.<br>
<br>
You <b>can</b> gain more than the average of the trinket. For example if the fight lasts 2m20s you could pop it twice. If the fight has silences of any duration when you know they're coming you're going to not use it during a silence but rather when not silenced and therefore it's average uptime out of the total time you were healing will be greater. Remember that if you're casting 1/2 the heals over the whole fight, the trinket might be doing 1/2 the healing but so does the static +healing you get from gear, and therefore the trinket will give you the 49.5 healing. If you use it any wiser and actually cast more than 1/2 of the time of it being active, while still only casting for 1/2 of the total fight duration, you gained more than 49.5 healing. Remmeber we're comparing the trinket to +healing benefits in order to decide if it's better/worse than other items, not how much absolute healing it does, as then you'd also have to calculate the absolute healing other stats would give to have a basis for comparison, so it's easier to compare it directly to +healing.<br>
<br>
<br>
In general there are a couple of possible scenarios:<br>
1. There are no interruptions, in which case you use it whenever it's up and gain the average benefit.<br>
2. You have no clue when interruptions happen. You pop it on every cooldown and gain the average benefit.<br>
3. You have a clue when interruptions happen, so pop the trinket when you're not getting interrupted and thus have it's uptime% higher than average, and gain more than the average value.<br>
4. You want the trinket for burst, and decide to save it. You will only make such decision if on average the burst benefit is more important than the efficiency benefit, therefore the trinket was better than just its average value.<br>
<br>
Give me a situation where you think you're gaining something that is not as good as the average value of the trinket, and I'll show you how on average you're gaining at least as much if not even gaining something better. The sheer fact you have the option to mindlessly mash it on every cooldown alone means that at worst you have to agree that the average gain can't be anything less than the trinket's average value of 49.5 healing efficiency-wise.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>If you have assigned your resto shamans to chain heal the raid, you are making optimal use of them.<br>
<br>
Arcaris: Strong healer with a solid spec. I see very few ways to improve, except for his choice of gems. He should be using mainly Teardrop Living Rubies or Teardrop Crimson Spinels. However, he has a Pyrestone in his shield. The socket bonus of 1 mp5 is not worth it. He should use a pure +healing gem. I would also regem the shoulders with red gems. If he’s using these gems to get the meta gem bonus, it’s not worth the loss of +healing.<br>
<br>
Terrere: Given his gear, he actually did quite a good job healing. However, his gear isn’t going to cut it on Bloodboil.<br>
<br>
He will be a weaker healer due to the large amount of PVP gear he wears. Also, what PVE gear he does have is low level for BT and Hyjal – lower city prayer book, the Kara healing ring (which is just plain awful at any level), and a shield from the Auction House.<br>
<br>
He also needs to respect to get Totemic Mastery (30 yards on totems instead of 20 yards). He can take a point out of Totemic Focus, which is a very weak talent.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Since their playing styles have already been touched on, I'll focus on the gear stand point.<br>
<br>
Arcaris-<br>
12 int/restore mana meta gem for starters is going to be a better net benefit than the haste. Bracers should be a 18/22 healing gem, as the 1mp5 is not worth it. His shield should be a 18/22 also, the socket is red, so there should be no reason to have anything else in there. He did a good job of ignoring the small amount of +healing bonus he gains from his gloves socket bonus. There should be no reason for him to have a int/mp5 gem in his boots, if he wants the socket bonus, go with a healing/int gem. <br>
<br>
His gear is solid, and should work quite well for what your content level is. After getting T6 helm, and socketing it with a healing/int gem, it would be safe for him to go all 18/22 healing gems for the most part except for his pants. Using the pants and the helm for the gems to meet the meta socket of 2 yellow and 2 blue.<br>
<br>
<br>
Hellcat-<br>
Same deal with the meta gem as before. He is already ignoring the socket bonus in his helm, so he should be using a 18/22 healing gem in place of that healing/mp5 gem. While his shoulders are probably not worth regemming, he would be better off with straight +healing gems. Replace the gem in his bracers with a healing one, again the 1 mp5 is not worth it.<br>
<br>
You shouldn't see much of a healing output difference between the two of them, given equal assignments and group setups.<br>
<br>
Terrere-<br>
As Skyhoof said, hes going to lack a lot of the needed stats for the longer and more mana intensive fights in the game. Because he lacks the MP5 from the gear, I'd say he is perfectly fine socketing with healing/mp5 gems, but just make sure once he does get more PVE gear, he sockets it in a efficient way. Vitality on his boots will be a nice upgrade in MP5 for him. If he is going to use the Lower City Prayer Book, just make sure he is using it on every cooldown. Main thing he needs to do is get vitality and more PVE gear.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>You gear is fairly similar to mine however I use about 120 haste and I have about 125 mp5. Both of my trinkets do not have mp5 but have mp5 equivlances (memento and alchemist) so really with that much plus heal I think you really should be getting alot more haste.   I haven't regemmed all my gear to take advantege of the haste gems yet but I'm kinda waiting to see where everything drops to see if I will be getting an upgrade soon or not.  with sunwell trash having very little trash in comparison with BT and Hyjal we are left somewhat short on gems atm.  I would also agree on keeping the insightful meta but unless you are already having major mana issues I'd go for alot more haste.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>You should do anything you can to boost the DPS of the raid, without sacrificing healing. If you can spare the GCD and mana, drop Searing Totem. On a recent Illidan fight, searing totems did nearly 30,000 damage. It's not huge but ask yourself how many times your guild has wiped on a boss at 1%. <br>

You can even toss flame shocks on some bosses as a healer, especially when grouped with a shadow priest.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>If you consistently get a Shadow Priest, and you have in the splits you linked, mana should not be a concern.  To this end you can re-gem extensively when spinels become available via the badge vendor.<br>
<br>
Specifically, do use a pair of +22 heal gems in your shoulders.  Further, keep the Girdle of Fallen Stars and simply re-gem that with spinels.  You will sacrifice a small fractional amount of your potential health/mana pool for a gain in throughput over the new badge belt.  I would even say to go as far as replacing every gem short of the few that meet your meta gem requirements.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Yes you are correct. I didn't forget about sunglow I had just stipulated in my original post that I was only listing mail items just to keep things simple.   Sunglow is very good though esp if you don't have tons of resto druids who will pounce you in your sleep if you take one.  However sunglow is not the only exceptional non-mail peice.<br>
<br>
If you bring non-mail items into the mix you must also take a look at the cloth shoulders which are techincally best in slot for us.<br>

</div>It looks like t6 shoudlers + sunglow is better but pretty much identical other than loosing14 int while gaining 5 stam. It looks like there are several combos that will yeild very similar results I think this should help in some flexiblity when people are picking up loot since we all know its hard for everyone to get best in slot if everyoneelse trys for it as well.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I"m not really sure what value you are putting on the mana pool or why.  The average caluclation of int to mp5 is simply<br>
1 int = 15 mana<br>
.24 *15 / 300seconds = .012mana/s<br>
.012 mana/s * 5s = .06mp5<br>
.06 mp5 *3HEP = .18 HEP<br>
<br>
so .18HEP (from mp5) + .39HEP(from healing) + .138HEP(from crit) = ~ .708HEP total. <br>
<br>
Personally I put a HEP of 1-2 on mp5 but I always have a spreist and alchemist stone.<br>
<br>
Edit: I accidentaly made 1 int only 10 mana in first example. DOH<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>It has the best overall stat distribution when it comes to stats that shaman think are "important". However, as the same as the JC ring that was mentioned above, at the highest end of raiding most shaman have their fill of all the stam, int, and mp5 they generally need. Skyhoof and Daidalos are making a list of gear that is going to best in slot for +haste and +healing essentially to provide the most increase to HPS.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Mercy is a gain of 2 int 5 healing and 13 haste for the cost of 9mp5. Stam is good but if you aren't dieng its worth 0.<br>
Mp5 is also not worth much if you have an spriest.  Personally being a tauren and having a spreist I don't feel the need for the stam or for the mp5.  I most certainly would pick it up should no one want it or if you feel you are too low on stam or mp5 for whatever reason.  There are times where I put on stam gear when learning a fight and Highborn is certainly good however 95% of the time I pefer HPS over everything else and would go with Mercy.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I agree that the HEP values for Tier 6 on the first page need to be consistent with the items that we are actually selecting as Best in Slot. I think it's the HEP values that need to change, not the items selected. The Tier 4 and Tier 5 values are still accurate. However, the Tier 6 values need to be re-evaluated. I will try to come up with some new numbers this weekend. <br>

It looks like there are several combos that will yeild very similar results I think this should help in some flexiblity when people are picking up loot since we all know its hard for everyone to get best in slot if everyoneelse trys for it as well.</div>

</div>I included both cloth and leather items in my list -- just to make it as comprehensive as possible. I'll try to rework the Best in Slot list to include the different options that are available depending on which pieces of Tier 6 you wear. The Shawl of Wonderment is a perfect example. I'm also going to add to the Best in Slot list which DPS caster items turn into our healing items. We almost let a shaman have the gloves last night for their off-spec, temporarily forgetting they can be transmuted. <!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Thats entirely up to you but in most cases potting with an alchemist stone and smart downranking and good use of tide mana spring and water shield even shaman without a spriest will not have mana issues.  This will vary from fight to fight as well as raid makeup (higher dps means shorter fights).  THe HEP values are guidlines for what most shaman can expect obviously if you are in a different situations adjust accordingly.  We did note that the HEP values were for t6 shamans with a spirest however.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>That is a good point, thank you. I also want to thank you guys for an excellent thread. While there are a few things that I disagree with, it is purely because of personal healing style (much more individual than DPS with set rotation), and alot of the information in here is invaluable.<br>

		<div id="post_message_709039"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I am a big fan of going for +Heal, while ignoring most of the bonuses for socketing the right colors unless they increase the total amount of +Heal. I wondered whether i wouldnt get a net benefit of hps by using the recently included haste gems. I found no information about that in this topic (or at least it hasnt been updated on the front page) so here is my calculation, if it has already been said, ignore this post.<br>
The spell i use the most is of course chain heal, so i wanted to optimise its hps, which is, assuming 3 jumps and ignoring crits, which are basicly additional factors without any impact on the final result unless you seriously consider socketing for spellcrit, which is a bad idea, given by:<br>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080415041747im_/http://elitistjerks.com/cgi-bin/mathtex.cgi?Hps=(Base + \frac{5}{7} \cdot DrF \cdot [Heal]) \cdot 1.1 \cdot 1.2 \cdot 1.75 \cdot\frac{(1+\frac{[Haste]}{1576})}{2.5}" alt="Hps=(Base + \frac{5}{7} \cdot DrF \cdot [Heal]) \cdot 1.1 \cdot 1.2 \cdot 1.75 \cdot\frac{(1+\frac{[Haste]}{1576})}{2.5}"><br>
DrF is the downranking penalty. I substitute all constant factors with A.<br>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080415041747im_/http://elitistjerks.com/cgi-bin/mathtex.cgi?Hps= A \cdot (Base + \frac{5}{7} \cdot DrF \cdot [Heal]) \cdot (1+\frac{[Haste]}{1576})" alt="Hps= A \cdot (Base + \frac{5}{7} \cdot DrF \cdot [Heal]) \cdot (1+\frac{[Haste]}{1576})"><br>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080415041747im_/http://elitistjerks.com/cgi-bin/mathtex.cgi?\frac{dHps}{d[Heal]}=A \cdot (1+\frac{[Haste]}{1576}) \cdot \frac{5}{7} \cdot DrF" alt="\frac{dHps}{d[Heal]}=A \cdot (1+\frac{[Haste]}{1576}) \cdot \frac{5}{7} \cdot DrF"><br>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080415041747im_/http://elitistjerks.com/cgi-bin/mathtex.cgi?\frac{dHps}{d[Haste]}=A \cdot (Base + \frac{5}{7} \cdot DrF \cdot [Heal]) \cdot \frac{1}{1576}" alt="\frac{dHps}{d[Haste]}=A \cdot (Base + \frac{5}{7} \cdot DrF \cdot [Heal]) \cdot \frac{1}{1576}"><br>
So here we have the benefit of +heal and spellhaste depending on spellhaste and +heal. Now we can gem 22 +heal or 10 spellhaste, so it is better to gem for +heal as long as:<br>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080415041747im_/http://elitistjerks.com/cgi-bin/mathtex.cgi?22 \cdot A \cdot (1+\frac{[Haste]}{1576}) \cdot \frac{5}{7} \cdot DrF > 10 \cdot A \cdot (Base + \frac{5}{7} \cdot DrF \cdot [Heal]) \cdot \frac{1}{1576}" alt="22 \cdot A \cdot (1+\frac{[Haste]}{1576}) \cdot \frac{5}{7} \cdot DrF > 10 \cdot A \cdot (Base + \frac{5}{7} \cdot DrF \cdot [Heal]) \cdot \frac{1}{1576}"><br>
Solving for +heal:<br>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080415041747im_/http://elitistjerks.com/cgi-bin/mathtex.cgi?(3467,2- \frac{7 Base}{5 DrF})+2,2 \cdot [Haste]>[Heal]" alt="(3467,2- \frac{7 Base}{5 DrF})+2,2 \cdot [Haste]>[Heal]"><br>
<br>
So to maximise your Hps with maxrank CH, you should gem for +22 Heal as long as this is true:<br>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080415041747im_/http://elitistjerks.com/cgi-bin/mathtex.cgi?2229,2 +2,2\cdot[Haste]>[Heal]" alt="2229,2 +2,2\cdot[Haste]>[Heal]"><br>
<br>
Generalized for all spells and gems, the +heal gem is hpswise superior to the hastegem as long as:<br>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080415041747im_/http://elitistjerks.com/cgi-bin/mathtex.cgi?(1576\frac{\mbox{+heal of healgem}}{\mbox{hasteof hastegem}}- \frac{\mbox{base healing of spell}}{DrF\cdot\frac{\mbox{base cast time of spell}}{3,5s}})+\frac{\mbox{+heal of healgem}}{\mbox{haste of hastegem}}\cdot[Haste]>[Heal]" alt="(1576\frac{\mbox{+heal of healgem}}{\mbox{hasteof hastegem}}- \frac{\mbox{base healing of spell}}{DrF\cdot\frac{\mbox{base cast time of spell}}{3,5s}})+\frac{\mbox{+heal of healgem}}{\mbox{haste of hastegem}}\cdot[Haste]>[Heal]"><br>
<br>
Optimising for maxrank chainheal this leads to the interesting conclusion that for typical BT high end gear it is advisable to use a few hastegems (5 for my current equipment), however with sunwell endgame gear healgems gain strength again (13 healgems compared to 1 hastegem in my personal "final" gear).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I didn't check all the math but look good first glance I'll take a better look later.  I did a similar write up in the ele sham thread just in my spread sheet not in latex :-p.  I guess what I"d recommend is taking at look at your best in slot item stats and doing the evaluation there since if you check whats optimal at every step as you upgrade gear you might end up with a slightly less than optimal gemming.<br>
<br>
Also just gathered some data on HST totem.<br>
with 3082+healing it was ticking for 221 and 222<br>
so solving for C  with purification and restorative totems.<br>

Skyhoof, I noticed awhile ago that in your section for haste gear, you list neck options twice. Once near the top, with <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33281" target="_blank">[Brooch of Nature's Mercy]</a>, and then again at the bottom, where you list <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=34360" target="_blank">[Amulet of Flowing Life]</a> and <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=34184" target="_blank">[Brooch of the Highborne]</a>.

		<div id="post_message_709894"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Hi, I'd like to offer some suggestions for the talents section on the upcoming think tank article.<br>
<br>
I suggest that rather than setting out that the main specs are 0/12/49, 8/0/53, 0/5/56 and so on, you start from the "bottom up" and look at the individual talents. With respect to the 8/0/53 spec, there is actually a lot of room for variation as to which talents you take (Healing Grace / Healing Way / Imp Reincarnation / Totemic Focus / Focused Mind are all candidates) so I think the article should go into this in more depth. Even if the "right answer" will in most cases end up being the same, it's better to explain why.<br>
<br>
I think the best approach to deciding on a talent spec is to work out what the essential points are and build up from there, rather than working backwards from 8/0/53 say.<br>
<br>
I suggest that the core talents for pve resto shaman are:<br>
Tidal Focus, Ancestral Healing, Healing Focus, Totemic Mastery, Restorative Totems, Tidal Mastery, Nature's Swiftness, Purification, Mana Tide Totem, Nature's Blessing, Improved Chain Heal and Earth Shield.<br>
<br>
There is probably even some room for whether or not some of these talents are "essential".<br>
<br>
With respect to the op, I don't agree that Healing Grace, Improved Healing Way and Healing Way are generally considered "must-have" talents for raiding. This is based on i) the rationale I set out below for evaluating each talent and ii) looking at specs of various shamans in other endgame guilds.<br>
<br>
Beyond the core talents, the remaining choices are generally quite situational and their value varies depending on:<br>
 - group makeup (how often you have a shadow priest dramatically affects the value of mana-related talents, how often you are buffing hunters/feral druids),<br>
 - gear (how much mp5 you have, mana pool etc.),<br>
 - mechanics in the specific fights your guild does (eg silences or nature/fire/frost damage),<br>
 - what healing role/s you play (particularly how often you use healing wave), and<br>
 - personal playstyle (including how much you value survivability)<br>
<br>
For any particular shaman, talent choices should be made by weighing up the value of the non-core talents depending on these factors. Many of the remaining talents are unimpressive so it's more a case of choosing the best out a bad bunch rather than deciding between multiple talents that you really want.<br>
<br>
Factors such as group makeup and healing roles vary greatly from guild to guild so the talent values do too.<br>
<br>
With respect to particular talents beyond the core:<br>
<br>
<b>Improved Healing Wave and Healing Way</b><br>
<br>
Improved Healing Wave increases the HPS of Healing Wave.<br>
Healing Way can be used to increase HPS and HPM of Healing Wave. It increases the healing of Healing Wave spells cast by other shamans.<br>
<br>
The value of these talents varied depending on:<br>
 - how often you cast Healing Wave,<br>
 - how often you cast Healing Wave multiple times on the same target,<br>
 - whether or not there are other shamans in the raid casting Healing Way on your target, and<br>
 - your need to increase HPS or HPM in doing so,<br>
<br>
In my view, Improved Healing Way and Healing Way should not be considered "must have" talents for raiding resto, because Healing Wave use can be very limited in raids. Also, the effect of Healing Way - increasing HPS and HPM of Healing Wave - can to an extent be achieved by other means (downranking etc.)<br>
Healing Wave use is much more common in 5 and 10 man content and it's a matter or personal preference whether you take this into account when choosing a spec.<br>
Note: Guilds with multiple resto shamans may want to require some but not all to spec Healing Way.<br>
<br>
<b>Improved Reincarnation</b><br>
<br>
The key thing this talent does is the increased mana and health when you reincarnate, and the decreased cooldown is just a bonus. This means you are more likely to survive the next few seconds before you get healed up to full (and have a bit more mana too.) Generally, you should not be dying regularly and accordingly this talent is not strong. However, its value increases for a particular boss fight if:<br>
 - there is a "guaranteed death" mechanic eg Azgalor or Teron Gorefiend, or<br>
 - you are somewhere between "first kill" and "on farm" on a fight where there is a chance you will die eg Illidari Council (which features a lot of random raid damage effects.)<br>
<br>
<b>Healing Grace</b><br>
<br>
This talents is only useful in fights where threat is relevant. It is a matter of personal preference whether or not to take into account trash fights when evaulating this talent. Boss fights where threat is relevant include Lady Vashj and Felmyst.<br>
<br>
<b>Totemic Focus</b><br>
<br>
The mana saved by this talent is not significant, but the value of this talent does increase if:<br>
 - you are having to recast totems more often than every 2 minutes (eg a fight where you have to move around), or<br>
 - you are casting totems of 3-4 schools (which may mean you are in a melee/hunter group and don't have a shadow priest.)<br>
<br>
<b>Focused Mind</b><br>
<br>
As with Healing Grace and threat, this talent is only useful in fights with a silence mechanic. Again, it is a matter or personal preference whether you take into account silence mechanics on trash when evaluating the value of this talent to you.<br>
<br>
<b>Nature's Guardian</b><br>
<br>
This talent provides excellent survivability and also deceases your threat. Note that less than 5 points still provides quite a significant chance to heal.<br>
In my view this talent is practically a must-have aside from specific cases where you need to invest a significant amount of points elsewhere.<br>
<br>
<b>Elemental Warding</b><br>
<br>
This may as well be an 8 point talent, because the tier 1 talents in elemental affect damage spells only and therefore are of little relevance to resto. However, despite costing 8 points Elemental Warding is a very strong talent for pve because fire, frost and nature effects are very common.<br>
With respect to the choice between Convection and Concussion, this comes down to personal choice.<br>
<br>
<b>Ancestral Knowledge</b><br>
<br>
The mana given by this talent is rather unimpressive numerically. The more mana you have, the more you get for each point in Ancestral Knowledge. To get a significant return from this talent you would need a lot of mana - in which case the marginal utility from the additional mana is low.<br>
<br>
<b>Shield Specialisation</b> and <b>Improved Lightning Shield</b><br>
<br>
Of very little use, and worse than Ancestral Knowledge as far as the tier 1 talents go. Only taken by shamans wanting Enhancing Totems.<br>
<br>
<b>Guardian Totems</b><br>
<br>
Relevant for fights where you drop grounding totem (Vashj?). This talent is generally only taken to get enough points for Enhancing Totems.<br>
<br>
<b>Improved Ghost Wolf</b><br>
<br>
Instant Cast Ghost Wolf. Relevant for fights where you need to move around a lot outside. For example Supremus, Archimonde and Felmyst.<br>
<br>
<b>Enhancing Totems</b><br>
This is sometimes taken by shamans who are regularly used in a group with hunters/feral druids. This can be achieved without sacrificing any of the core healing talents, and you do get to pick up Improved Ghost Wolf along the way.<br>
Taking Improved Weapon Totems to buff Windfury Totem would require too much of a sacrifice in the resto tree - you couldn't take Earth Shield or 2/2 Improved Chain Heal.<br>
<br>
<b>Common specs</b><br>
<br>
8/0/53 is popular among endgame resto shamans, though with a degree of variation in where to put the non-core points in resto. <a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?talent=hVcZZEc0tAeoted" target="_blank">This </a>is a common version.<br>
<br>
0/5/56 and 0/0/61 - these specs are more common among the general population, and allow almost all the talents in resto.<br>
<br>
<b>Other variations</b><br>
<br>
After 2.4, resto shamans have been experimenting with various builds which include Improved Ghost Wolf. This can be done in several ways:<br>
0/7/54, <a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?talent=hZx0bZEs0tAeoted" target="_blank">for example</a>,  just takes Imp Ghost Wolf and puts the remaining points in Resto<br>
0/12/49, <a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?talent=hZxbdbZEc0tVjoted" target="_blank">for example</a>, which goes further into Enhancement for Enhancing Totems<br>
8/7/46, <a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?talent=hVcZx0bZVf0tAxotjd" target="_blank">for example</a>, which takes both elemental warding and improved ghost wolf. This requires more of a sacrifice in the resto trees, which in this example is achieved by skipping the Healing Wave talents.<br>
<br>
Whether these specs are good for a particular shaman/guild will depend on the factors set out above. Because talents beyond the core ones are so situational, there is no clear best spec.<br>
<br>
<br>
I realise that this post is a bit of a re-hash of some of my earlier posts re: Healing Way, with more discussion of some of the other talents. I am currently specced 8/0/53 with Healing Grace and Healing Way mainly because of Felmyst, where in phase 1 I am generally healing a tank with Healing Wave because Chain Heal won't bounce.<br>
<br>
However, I remain of the view that Healing Way isn't a must-have talent for every raiding shaman. The buff to Improved Ghost Wolf in particular gives us a reason to consider more points in enhancement, and Healing Way/Imp Healing Wave should be on the list of potential talents to sacrifice.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

While I agree that Healing Way is not a must have talent, I think to not have Imp Healing Wave is reckless. There are to many times where we need to throw a off heal on a tank while another healer is moving (see Brut when a MT healer has to move to burn pile) and the .5 seconds there is invaluable.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I'm not really sure what this means.<br>
<br>
The original post says "This is the spot to discuss everything about healing as a shaman."<br>
<br>
The reason I posted was to offer some suggestions for the upcoming theorycrafting think tank item on Resto shaman, because I think there are some problems with the talent information in the original post (which I am imagining the think tank item will be based on?) If this is not the right place to make such a post, I apologise and am happy to be redirected.<br>
<br>
I don't agree that Healing Grace, Healing Way and Improved Healing Wave are must-have raiding talents. I have set out the reason I don't think they are. Of the three, Imp Healing Wave is closest to essential, and could only really be skipped with a very consistent raid group with 1 shaman that knew they would always be on chain heal/lhw.<br>
<br>
As well as this being my view, if you look at resto shaman builds in various endgame raiding guilds, there is variation on whether or not people actually take these talents. This indicates that there isn't a general consensus on those particular talents being necessary.<br>
<br>
Note that just because I think these talents are not essential does not mean I think they will be the optimal talents to pick in many cases. However I think it's important to acknolwedge that there are other choices (particularly wihen you might want to get Enhancing Totems or Imp Ghost Wolf and Elemental Warding.)<br>
<br>
I'm happy to agree to disagree on this issue.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
I don't think we need to cover every single talent in detail, nor give umpteen dozen possible builds. A few typical example builds should be enough, rather than giving every possible build around. The key thing to realise is that we're not going to cover everything, because most of the stuff we won't be covering is just a copy/paste from somewhere like WoWHead and just be the ability description.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Just that I think there is more room for variation than currently acknowledged, particular with Healing Grace and Healing Way. "Freeing up" those points opens up a lot more legitimate choices to spec as a raiding resto shaman.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

To Mestok: Could you kindly test ingame and post here ticks of Earth Shields Rank1 and Rank3 with +3188 healing.<br>

		<div id="post_message_710239"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I think that Healing Way is a talent created specifically for undergeared Shamans that are attempting to heal through incredible predictable damage.  (For example, Heroic Bog Lords.  Heroic Naga Guards.)  Sometimes it is downright impossible to heal through this incredible damage without using all of your ability and trinket cooldowns.  I've experienced these situations when my Shaman was undergeared, and having Healing Way would have made those situations much easier to deal with.<br>
<br>
I think that Improved Healing Wave is a must; it's convenient, easily accessible, and there's not much else to spend your talent points on.  Healing Wave--once again--is great for situations where you are undergeared and are in danger of going out of mana.  Instead of spending your last mana points (and entering the very dangerous realm where you can't even drop a damn totem), you spam-interrupt your Healing Wave on whoever you need to keep alive, and only let the cast finish when they are at risk of dying.  This risk of dying becomes much greater when your cast is .5 seconds longer.<br>
<br>
But Healing Way?  Nah; more or less useless in a 25-man raid situation.  If only it applied to Lesser Healing Wave!<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Too much plus heal?? I have ~2450 +healing and my guild is currenting working on The Eredar Twins in Sunwell so I'm goning assume you don't outgear me or have done any content I haven't.  Our druid tanks have 28k+ hp our prot wars have ~22k hp fully buffed, I still find myself in situations where I need to spam healing waves on the MT e.g. corrosion on felmyst, stomp on brutalis, last rotation tank up in kalecgos and all healers are below.  Those situations pretty much any healer who can will be spamming his max rank heal.  In other situations I have had other shaman in guild who dropped the imp healing wave and healing way talents because they felt they were chain heal bots only for a pally to get d/c and get assigned to a tank.  At that point they had to explain to the RL why he coudn't fill in as a MT healer.  This is a waste of a raid spot if you pingeonhole yourself so you cannot adapt.  The difference in healing done between HWs with and without healing way is huge and the the situations I list above happen all the time.  Basically if a shaman in my guild showed up in Sunwell without imp healing wave and healing way I'd ask him to go respec.  <br>
<br>
Maybe other people have strats where the above situations never happen to them but I still think you are severely gimping your abilities for very little gain.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_710537"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I Agree - Improved Healing Wave (and i would say Healing Way too) is a core talent for resto shaman spec.

</div>So you would rather spec for the might be then assume that roles will be filled by the correct classes? There are certainally fights where Healing Way is must have, and I spec into it for those fights, but for a fight like Brut, where my role is to keep the raid alive and I am CH spamming, it is a wasted talent point. I am personally not afraid to respec day to day, we downed Brut yesterday and I was 0/12/49 for synergy with the Hunters/Druid tank, and today for Felmyst I will be 8/7/46 for damage reduction and instant GW. Neither fight requires me to spec into Healing Way. For the Twins I will most likely go back to a spec more like 0/0/61 or 8/0/53 and pick it back up.<br>

		<div id="post_message_710773"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I've got a question for the Sunwell geared shamans about a meta gem dilema.<br>
<br>
Is it worth it to keep the <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=25901" target="_blank">[Insightful Earthstorm Diamond]</a> as the meta and switch 2 yellow or blue sockets to green gems to meet the 2 yellow and 2 blue requirement or switch to <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=25897" target="_blank">[Bracing Earthstorm Diamond]</a> and gem straight for red gems forgo'ing any gem slot bonus.  I was looking at your best in slot gear and the two slots that I could see that would be the best increase would be the yellow socket on the <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=34402" target="_blank">[Shroud of Chieftain Ner'zhul]</a> and the blue socket on  <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=34383" target="_blank">[Kilt of Spiritual Reconstruction]</a>.  <br>
<br>
Switching both from red to green gems would -44 healing for 10 intellect and 8 mp5 and keep the meta proc on Insightful.  Or is it better to keep the 44 healing and +26 healing from the meta.  The spell haste green seems alright but its a bit on the weak side unless more stamina is needed.  I guess it comes down to:<br>
<br>
(70 healing and -2% threat) vs (10 int and 25.5mp5) vs (14 spell haste and 14 Stamina and 21.5mp5)<br>
(91 EP) vs (82 EP) vs (96.7 EP)<br>
<br>
I've been personally leaning towards the 70 healing is a bit better.  It is too bad that there isnt a Spell Haste + Mp5 Green gem.  Currently I've been gemmed for mp5 right now since we were severly stiffed on Spinal drops but now that we have a lot more, I'm trying to consider gemming straight Red and the healing meta or sacrifice 2 slots to get the Mana restore meta.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>If you are willing to respec everyfight I could almost buy this argument but when you go through the entire instance in one night leaving to respec every fight seems more of a waste of the guilds time than optimizing.  When you are first learning an encounter I guess its ok though. I don't really see what we offer is worth sacrificing the ability to MT heal overall.  <br>
<br>
Imp ghost wolf on felmyst is handy but not really necessary. If you have plenty of MT healing you might not have to heal the MT on corrosion so healing way might not be a big deal for you.  In our guild shaman switch to heal the MT during it.  Felmyst was actually the fight where the shaman who dropped healing way ended up assigned to MT healing and had to explain why he couldn't.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I was looking at your best in slot gear and the two slots that I could see that would be the best increase would be the yellow socket on the <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=34402" target="_blank">[Shroud of Chieftain Ner'zhul]</a> and the blue socket on  <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=34383" target="_blank">[Kilt of Spiritual Reconstruction]</a>.  <br>
<br>
Switching both from red to green gems would -44 healing for 10 intellect and 8 mp5 and keep the meta proc on Insightful.  Or is it better to keep the 44 healing and +26 healing from the meta.  I guess it comes down to:<br>
<br>
(70 healing and -2% threat) vs (10 int and 28mp5)<br>
<br>
I've been personally leaning towards the 70 healing is a bit better.  It is too bad that there isnt a Spell Haste + Mp5 Green gem.  Currently I've been gemmed for mp5 right now since we were severly stiffed on Spinal drops but now that we have a lot more, I'm trying to consider gemming straight Red and the healing meta or sacrifice 2 slots to get the Mana restore meta.</div>

</div>I've been thinking about this also. I'm quite temped to go all spinels in sunwell gear and take the healing meta. Keep in mind <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=35759" target="_blank">[Forceful Seaspray Emerald]</a> still gives a good HPS increase so Insightful won't be that bad to meet either.  I personally haven't decided yet but I'm currently leaning toward the Bracing due to ease of the meta requirement when gemming spinels. On the other hand since Insightful has no cooldown I know of it scales with haste so thats also nice and since haste gems are yellow you can go that route and not give up much.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_710843"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I've only done sunwell trash buts its pretty mana intensive.  I would imagine the boss fights the same.  If your socketing like I am and trying to use as many +heal gems as posible, I would sacrafice a few sockets and get the requirements for the <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=25901" target="_blank">[Insightful Earthstorm Diamond]</a>.  I don't think either way is game breaking.  Your not going to wipe and say to yourself man I wish I had that +70 healing now, this +300 mana I got here and there cost me the fight.  It's pretty cool to see +300 mana proc.  The +heal extra you get by switching to all +heal is so minor you won't even tell.  And you won't drop to many bosses in sunwelle if the -2 percent threat is needed.  Thats my thoughts.  <br>
<br>
I've personally scratched my head and few times and thought the same, and just said screw it.  It's not worth the time comparing situations where it might help.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Maybe I just have too much +Heal, but I still don't understand why you'd want Healing Way in a raid situation.  My Healing Wave--without any Healing Way stacks--will heal a tank to full, unless that tank is at a dangerous amount of HP.  The dangerous amount of HP is where I would begin to worry; where are the Druid HOTs?  Why did I allow the tank to get so low?<br>
<br>
Of course, I've always been a preventative kind of guy.  I don't like unexpected things to happen and I don't like dealing with the consequences (although I'm <i>great</i> at dealing with the consequences).  I prefer perfection and prevention over troubleshooting.  That's why I don't like Healing Way.  --But again, Resto Shamans have a lot of leeway with their talent points, and it's not a make-or-break talent.  If you find it useful, go for it.<br>

</div>One more thing. "too much +heal" does not exist, and 18% to healing translates into one thing. Downrank to a skill level that heals 18% less for the same affect and save the mana, and when you need that extra 18% because the tank manages to get parry gibbed or something of the like, you can step up and fill in the gap. "I've always been a preventative kind of guy" If thats the case you would spec for every situation, including becoming the MT healer mid fight for one reason or another (MT healer dies, DC's, has to take care of something that happens IRL), as apposed to having some barely useful 3 points in enh or ele. I do not see how you can justify not choosing a spec to maximise your effectiveness at your job just because you feel like CH is the only thing you will ever cast.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">If you are willing to respec everyfight I could almost buy this argument but when you go through the entire instance in one night leaving to respec every fight seems more of a waste of the guilds time than optimizing.  When you are first learning an encounter I guess its ok though. I don't really see what we offer is worth sacrificing the ability to MT heal overall.  <br>
<br>
Imp ghost wolf on felmyst is handy but not really necessary. If you have plenty of MT healing you might not have to heal the MT on corrosion so healing way might not be a big deal for you.  In our guild shaman switch to heal the MT during it.  Felmyst was actually the fight where the shaman who dropped healing way ended up assigned to MT healing and had to explain why he couldn't.</div>

</div>I agree with you for "farm" content I spec differently, typically 0/0/61 TBH, and I can do anything. However, when learning a new encounter I prefer to spec in the most efficient possible spec for what I am EXPECTED to do.

</div>I guess I tend to disagree a bit with how you guys choose to gem, but I think I am going to aim for keeping my <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=25901" target="_blank">[Insightful Earthstorm Diamond]</a>. I will probably use <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=35761" target="_blank">[Quick Lionseye]</a> and <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32216" target="_blank">[Royal Shadowsong Amethyst]</a> to meet the requirements for the meta. Everything else I will likely socket with spinels. <br>
<br>
I've been playing around with a really heavy spell haste setup this raid week (which I think I logged in). I never had mana issues on anything in Sunwell. I rarely have the shadow priests, and usually don't have mana issues with around 330 spell haste. I'm not sure I want to keep that much haste, but it's been a lot of fun to use and play around with. When the gem vendor opens I think I'm going to keep just what I need for the <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=25901" target="_blank">[Insightful Earthstorm Diamond]</a> and socket the rest with spinels. Although, I would like to try a very heavy spell haste set just to have fun and see how it goes. From my limited experience with Eredar twins, it just seems like you can't heal fast enough. <br>
<br>
For the record, I really don't see the big benefit from losing the Healing Wave talents. I heal tanks quite a bit in Sunwell, much like Daidalos said, it's really beneficial. You really don't spend as much time chain healing on Brutallus as it would seem. I try to switch to Healing Wave during stomp and when the raid has been topped off after a slash. Healing Wave is also really nice for the spikes during Corrosion on Felmyst. I also don't really see the point of Imp. ghost wolf, it's just not really that helpful for anything I've seen so far.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Well the thing is if you go that route, you would have to use up 4 slots from Spinals to Yellow/Purple.<br>
4 Spinals = 88 Healing (+26 Healing Meta)<br>
2 Quick Lionseyes + 2 Royal SA = 22 Healing + 4 mp5 + 20 Spell Haste. (+7 Healing and 4mp5 from Socket Bonuses and 17.5 mp5 from Meta)<br>
<br>
So by sacrificing 4 gems the comparison is:<br>
(85 Healing and -2% Threat) vs (25.5mp5 and 20 Spell Haste)<br>

</div>I won't disagree with you there, but it is nice to have any little edge. Last night I did not have imp GW and I had no real issues getting MCd, but it would be nice to get into position sooner allowing me to resume heals on the skelly tank. Not as a "crutch" (since the issue for me is less down time between heals rather than not sucking) but as an edge. However, last night I was 8/0/53 and found Elemental Warding really had little to no impact (about ~1k total damage an attempt mitigated) so I will most likely go 0/7/53 next attempt.<br>
<br>
Moral of the story, I think Healing Way is a very valuable Resto talent, almost every PvE build I run with has it, but I don't feel it is "must have" for a 25 man raiding Shaman. Alot of people talk about throwing the off HW on a tank on Brut or during Corrosion on Felmyst, and I do the same, the reason I think IHW is a "must have" talent, but if they are in a situation where they have to spam on the tank, and the 18% will make a difference, there is a problem somewhere else.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_712115"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->The stat values you're trying to assign don't only depend on gear level.<br>
<br>
For efficiency, the more mana you have the more mp5 each point of +healing is worth. While this changes slowly as you change your gear stats (not to mention when you increase both mp5 and healing the changes are even smaller), but when you suddenly get +250-300 mp5 from a shadow priest it really shifts the balance. Remember at the end if you use all your mana healing done = HPM * mana available. The more mana you have available the more HPM is going to help and vice versa. Again these changes are usually not big when you adjust gear a little, but something as major as getting a shadow priest can seriously shift the +healing value VS mp5/int.<br>
<br>
On a side note while you could go and say "I want to not be dependant on shadow priest" and increase the value of mp5, remember that using the higher mp5 value to compare items is directly gimping yourself when you do have a shadow priest. So there's no real option other than deciding wether you have or don't have a shadow priest in progression fights and gear accordingly, and where possible have alternative gear.<br>
<br>
Last thing is the HPS burst VS efficiency - while being able to do enough healing to cover the damage without needing to use more than all the mana you have available (in other words, not go oom), if you're not able to unload large enough amounts of healing on certain fights you'll find yourself losing people while you still have mana. Choosing wether avoiding losing people when you have mana left VS avoiding going oom also greatly affects the values of haste (and +healing) when compared to mp5 (and int) - especially when haste gives hardly any efficiency gains and mp5 doesn't give any burst abilities. So to evaluate stats you really have to get priorities straightened up and decide wether not going oom is a bigger issue or not having enough burst is. Without making such a descision a comparison between items that increase both efficiency and HPS by different amounts will be impossible. And not only you have to decide what's more important, you also have to decide how much of one you're actually willing to give up to gain the other, or by how much one is more important than the other - as obviously niether is useless in any fight.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Regardless of how much you're healing for with each bounce it only reaches so many people. I'm finding the value of haste to be a little higher and that of healing to not be as high. MP5 is nice, and I take it where I can get it, but I don't value it enough to go out of my way for it.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I get different HEP values but the same overall results, showing Lionseye + Royal SA are the best option (see note of caution about that conclusion below):<br>
<br>
4 Spinels + Bracing Earthstorm = 114.4 + 33.8 = <b>148.2</b><br>
<br>
2 Quick Lionseyes + 2 Royal SA + IED = 68.2 + 12 + 40 + 9.1 + 12 + 52.5 = <b>193.8</b><br>
<br>
But you also have to consider using the Seaspray Emeralds in two slots<br>
<br>
2 Seasprays + 2 Spinels + IED = +10 Haste and +4 mp5 + 17.5 mp5 +44 healing<br>
                                     = 20 + 12 + 52.5 + 57.2 = 141.7 <br>
<br>
So, yes, if we go by the HEP numbers in the OP the Lionseyes with the Royal SA are the best option but those numbers are going to be revised so I would hang on before making a decision. The mp5 value may be too high and distorting the values. To me, it doesn't make intuitive sense to sacrifice 4 spinels for other gems to get the meta gem proc.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_712429"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->For what it's worth Daidalos, I wear around 160 haste and 4pc T6 for that fight.  I always thought Brutallus was healing intensive but Twins is on a different level in that how spread the damage is.  (I believe twins talk is still forbidden so there'll be no details there.)<br>
<br>
Judging from the way Sunwell has played out, I'm starting to think the pure number of targets healed is playing a greater role than the amount healed.  I'm really not sure how to quantify it at all at the moment.  Perhaps I'll give it some thought later when I have more time.  All in all, Sunwell's damage intake has a strange feel of AV where damage taken is all over the place and it's more imporatant to land fast heals to many targets asap.<br>
<br>
This is causing me to take a step back to consider my gems as our bank has tons and tons of lionseyes and no spinels.  But I'm going to give it some more thought first.<br>
<br>
Edit:  And actually thinking about it some more, this also applies to something like Brutallus.  The damage coming in isn't exactly periodic, and the key really feels like it's to land as many heals within a window before he destroys your tank.  To that end, it's why you assign X amounts of healers spamming away, but haste will artificially increase the odds of your heals landing within that window.  Not very well theorycrafted, I know, but it's just something that I've been mulling over.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I don't know how you're doing it, but I'm getting the same impression from the fight so far. I only have 1 1/2 nights of attempts on them, but I almost feel required to use tons of haste for it. It's a short fight, so I don't think mana will be an issue, and to many people are just taking to much damage at once.  I'd rather give 9-10 people 1/3 of their HP then 5-6 people 2/3, especially since I know they will likely get the rest of their health from another healer.  <br>
<br>
Once I get all the Sunwell items I want I probably won't bother socketing for haste (besides meta requirements). Until then however, I think I'm going to go for more haste gems during progression.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>This really sums up my experience with Sunwell so far. I really feel I am healing for enough already. The problem I'm seeing the most is healing lots of people fast enough. I trust the other healers enough that I don't have to heal everyone fully, just enough to keep them alive until they get topped off. <br>

		<div id="post_message_712612"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->It actually is a perfectly valid statement.  First of all, your assumption is wrong because practically every sunwell encounter has a consistent AoE damage that affects everyone to varying degrees (depending on your number of debuffs etc), and several burster moves that deal huge amounts of damage to differing number of people that will happen across groups.  <br>
<br>
As for the haste statement, you also need to realize that my haste gear gives me 2400 healing and my unhasted gear gives me 2500.  Given around 200+ haste, I would find it hard to imagine that the extra heals I can cast can't make up for +100 healing.<br>
<br>
Edit:  I might add that, I don't deny that healing assignments could use some fine tuning.  But our raid make-up is fairly random depending on who's online so we do have to make-due with what we get.  Finally, the main difference between Sunwell gear and our current gear really is that each piece gives 30 haste and 10 healing.  I think it's fairly safe to say that Blizzard is designing things with haste in mind, and regemming and using a haste set is a way to get there.  I think it's fine so long as the +healing loss is minimal, but I admit that I haven't really gone through and done the math yet. <!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

So, yes, if we go by the HEP numbers in the OP the Lionseyes with the Royal SA are the best option but those numbers are going to be revised so I would hang on before making a decision. The mp5 value may be too high and distorting the values. To me, it doesn't make intuitive sense to sacrifice 4 spinels for other gems to get the meta gem proc.</div>

</div>I think you're right about the HEP values, but at the same time, what's best on paper isn't always best in practice. The mp5 makes it look better than it really is, my point was more than I think spinels are slightly overvalued right now. Giving up a really strong meta for an average one over a few spinels doesn't make sense to me. It's great, and certainly better to socket with spinels than amethyst, but not at the cost of haste. I lose a little bit of healing and gain haste, and some mp5, to make the gems I need for the meta. Since I find haste a lot more useful, it works out best for me. <br>
<br>
In the long run I'm sure spinels will win out, they allow us a lot of room to maneuver. There is already a ton of haste on the  Sunwell items. Just seems to me haste is king right now. With 327 haste I still have 2300 healing and 4pc t6. It's not like I'm really losing tons of healing. Down ranking is still entirely viable. <br>
<br>
As for the meta, I really don't see another one I like better. I really don't feel like I'm sacrificing anything to get it.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Using Pitbuller’s equation:<br>
0.3 * healing(HEP) + (22.8/80) * crit(HEP) + (1 + 0.24 * number of manatides) * (15mana / (0.2 * duration) * mp5(HEP))<br>
<br>
0.3 * 1.0 + 0.285 * 0.88 + (1 + 0.24) * (15 / (0.2 * 300)) * 1.32 = 0.9569<br>
<br>
However, let’s assume it’s a 10-minute fight where Mana Tide is dropped once. The value for Intellect using Pitbuller’s equation becomes 0.7295 compared with the HEP value of 0.75. Now the HEP values seem consistent with the mechanics of the game.<br>
<br>
Using these values we need to re-evaluate a few items for Best in Slot:<br>
<br>

<br>
Someone (Rosholm) already mentioned the jewelcrafting BOP ring being the best in slot using the old HEP values and it seems to still hold true with the new ones.<br>
<br>
The only real surprise is the Chain Links of Tumultuous Storm, which is a DPS caster item.  In fact, it’s the item that is transmuted into Kilt of Spiritual Reconstruction. Basically, the haste on these legs outweighs the lower +healing when compared with the Leggings of Eternity, which have no haste. So if these drop but your guild can’t spare a sunmote for a transmute they would still be worth equipping and using.<br>
<br>
<b><font size="2">Gemming</font></b><br>
Now that we have some solid HEP values (I hope anyway) let’s take a look at gemming our best-in-slot items again.<br>
<br>
<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32195" target="_blank">[Teardrop Crimson Spinel]</a> x 4 + <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=25897" target="_blank">[Bracing Earthstorm Diamond]</a> = 88 healing + 26 healing = 114 healing = 114 HEP<br>
<br>
<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=35761" target="_blank">[Quick Lionseye]</a> x 2 + <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32216" target="_blank">[Royal Shadowsong Amethyst]</a> x 2+ <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=25901" target="_blank">[Insightful Earthstorm Diamond]</a> =  20 spell haste + 22 healing + 4 mp5 + 17.5 mp5 + 4 mp5 (socket bonuses) + 7 healing (shoulder socket bonus) + 12 Intellect<br>
= 20 spell haste + 29 healing + 25.5 mp5 +12 Intellect<br>
= 40 + 22 + 5.2 +22.75 + 5.2 +7 + 9= 111.15 HEP<br>
<br>
<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=35759" target="_blank">[Forceful Seaspray Emerald]</a> x 2 + <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32195" target="_blank">[Teardrop Crimson Spinel]</a>x 2 + <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=25901" target="_blank">[Insightful Earthstorm Diamond]</a>=+10 Haste and +4 mp5 + 17.5 mp5 +44 healing + 12 Intellect<br>
= 20 + 5.2 + 22.75 +44 + 9 = 100.95<br>
<br>
So, using all Spinels (except perhaps for the helm with the yellow slot) seems to maximize healing. However, there's a strong argument to be made for gemming with 2 Quick Lionseyes and 2 Royal Shadowsong Amethysts. By using the yellow and purple gems, you lose 85 healing but gain 20 spell haste and 25.5 mp5 and 12 Intellect. And given that there’s no cooldown on the IED and spell haste will increase the number of spells cast, a good argument could be made to gem in this manner.<br>
<br>
EDIT: Also looks like the <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32328" target="_blank">[Botanist's Gloves of Growth]</a> with 2 red gems are better than the <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=34409" target="_blank">[Gauntlets of the Ancient Frostwolf]</a><br>

</div>OK, math isn't my strong point so please bear with me butchering these calculations:<br>
<br>
Amount healed + amount healed * 0.5 *(% crit rate)<br>
Then I multiplied by 1.05 for the T6 set bonus<br>
Then divided by the time it takes to cast the heal (factoring in haste) to get HPS<br>
(Crit healing/sec – reg healing/sec) divided by crit rating (22.07) = value of crit<br>
<br>
Here’s a example (forgive the rounding):<br>
<br>
Your chain heal normally heals for 5300. With a 15% crit rate, you get about 5700 on average of healing done. And with T6 the average healing done rises to nearly 6000. If you have 20% haste, then you get: 6000/(2.5/(1+.2) = 2885 hps. Let’s say with no crits you can heal 2878 hps, for a difference of 13 hps. 13 hps/22.07 (crit rating) = 0.59<br>
<br>
Now if the value for healing is around 0.65, then the crit rating becomes 0.59/.65 = .91<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
Everyone knows that healing crits go to overheal more often than normal heals.<br>
It happens just because you predict how much you should to heal now and you don't hope for lucky crit.<br>
So average crit is lesser than 150% of average normal heal. So actual value of crits must be lesser than calculated on the base of 150% coefficient. Its first point.<br>
<br>
And the second point is ancestral fortitude procs caused by crits. Depends on this fact crit value must be higher than just addidional heal/hps.<br>
<br>
Actually i don't know how to solve numerically this dialectic problem. But its definitely should be taken into account when you calculate numerical value for crit.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Everyone knows that healing crits go to overheal more often than normal heals.<br>
It happens just because you predict how much you should to heal now and you don't hope for lucky crit.<br>
So average crit is lesser than 150% of average normal heal. So actual value of crits must be lesser than calculated on the base of 150% coefficient. Its first point.</div>

</div>And the first point not entirely accurate. The point of the numeric values is to optimize theoretical hps, without taking overheal into consideration. While overheal should be considered when selecting your gear you shouldn't directly consider it when optimizing your gear for hps. Spellcrit will increase your hps just as any other stat.<br>

</div>I believe we try to optimize for hps using chainheal. While you can use chainheal for your tank healing you will most likely be assigned for raid healing when aiming for max hps chainheal. In this case your ancestral fortitude buff will have close to no effect to your "effective hps" (taking damage mitigation produced by your buff into account).<br>
<br>
After all, I guess we can just consider that ancestral fortitude will make up for what we lose to overhealing crits <!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Hmm... In my opinion spellcrit differs from any other way to increase my hps.<br>
Each player have his own overheal percentage based on his preferably playstyle. I.e. if i have more +healing i will downrank spells in another way but i will choose spells for keeping tank at full hp and my overheal will be the same.<br>
<br>
<b>Example:</b><br>
Assume that some shaman has 1000  theorertical hps and 10% overheal. His real hps is 900.<br>
He increases theoretical hps for +100, now he has 1100 hps and the same overheal. His real hps becames 990.<br>
As we can see the real hps is proportional to theoretical 900/1000=990/1100=0.9, so we can just dont use this 0.9 coefficient in the model and optimizing process (because results of optimizing will be the same).<br>
<br>
<b>Another example:</b><br>
Another shaman has 1000  theorertical hps and 10% overheal. His real hps is 900.<br>
He increases theoretical hps for +100 by adding +20%crits. Normal heals now are still for 2500 healing (crits for 3750), so he start healing when someone loose more than 2500hp (at least i wont wait for 3750), next heal lands to target and it is critical heal. As result almost half of heal go to overheal, so our overheal percentage inevitably grows.<br>
Finally shaman has 1100 theoretical hps and 15%-20% overheal. His real hps is 880-935.<br>
As we can see real hps arent propotional to the theoretical. So we must'nt reject this overheal percentage from the model and should use it when do our optimizing.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>No, I am not assuming a 2% proc rate. We are assuming the proc rate is 5%. The information on Wowhead seems to be correct. However, when I looked at some WWS the gem seemed to return 15-20 mp5 in a raid (3-4%), or an average of 17.5 mp5. This is probably due to the fact that we do stop casting at times in some fights.<br>

</div>Boko while you are correct there are also plenty of times where you simply spam your max rank trying to get the most HPS.  You are also assuming that everyone throws a 2700 heal exactly when the health defecit is 2700.  Frequently I don't even look at health on most fights since I'm just spamming like crazy, however on those predictable enough to throw an exact rank for a particular amount I freuqntly under heal a little due to others throwing up heal and taking the chance that I might crit.  If the fight was extremely predictable the tanks health would slowly decline until I either up ranked or got a crit and then it would start over.   <br>
<br>
I have never thought that HEP could substitute for a player understanding his class and his particular role.  As such I feel we should not devalue crit because it can lead to overheal.  I don't entirely disagree with your argument however there is no fixed amount we can devalue crit without being entirely arbitraty.  If you build a crit heavy build you can also factor this into your heal values when throwing up heals.  I really don't feel we should change crit due to overheal anymore than we should devalue haste due to mana consumption.  Understand your class and know more than just HEP values and everyone should be fine.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_715198"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I'd vote on Crystal Spire being better.  Looking at our WWS, I got 49 procs in 5 minutes on the Eredar Twins.  <br>
<br>
Assuming *ideal* situations, I think I get 2.23 CH cast times with 190 haste (what I was wearing).  That's 134.5 casts in 5 minutes assuming perfect casting with 0 latency.<br>
<br>
With Dark Blessing, I would have 220 haste which equates to 2.19 cast times and around 136.9 total Chain Heal casts.<br>
<br>
Round both down, and the difference in 5 minutes is 2 CH casts with perfect latency which never happens.  So in that regard, I'd easily take the Crystal Spire over Dark Blessing.  If you're downing Illidan, you can get plenty of haste in all the other spots.  The Crystal Spire proc is pretty darn amazing.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>While haste does increase m/s, it also reduces total time between casts making you more effective in many situations. I feel this offsets any loss in mana and in many cases far exceeds its "pure" hps benefit.<br>
<br>
I am in complete agreement for Sky's weights for a full hyjal+bt / SW shaman.  Looking at full sunwell it doesn't seem that stat weights will change much either.  I think the stats are with a spirest though so if you don't you may reduce haste a little and increase mp5.  If other people doing sunwell without a spirest can offer any input its welcome.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
And for burst situations where someone is going to die and needs that heal now, the mace proc is effectively increasing your heal size by 180-220, so <u>for burst it </u>adds the amount of +healing required to increase your heal size by that amount. Not in 100% of the possible cases where burst is needed, but most situations I can think of when you need max burst your target will be under 50% HP, as if it isn't it probably doesn't need your max burst anyway (again not a 100% rule but generally is what happens).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>There is no way anything is comparable pre-sunwell.  So lets look at the best MH from sunwell.<br>
Spire vs Gavel (stats wise the best in game)<br>
<br>
<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=34199" target="_blank">[Archon's Gavel]</a><br>
I wouldn't consider Brutalis an ideal fight since I am actually spamming the MT with chains and he shouldn't be under 50% too often.  So in a pure raid healing situation it could be even higher.<br>
+25 Intellect<br>
+24 Stamina<br>
Red Socket<br>
Socket Bonus: 1 Mana per 5 sec.<br>
Equip: Increases healing done by up to 500 and damage done by up to 167 for all magical spells and effects.<br>
Equip: Restores 10 mana per 5 sec.<br>
<br>
25int * (.75) =   18.75<br>
24stam*(.3) =  7.2<br>
22 healing gem =  22<br>
1mp5 *1.3 = 1.3<br>
500healing= 500 <br>
10mp5 *1.3<br>
total   = 562<br>
<br>
Stats wise gavel is quite amazing but with spire putting the extra healing when I need it most I don't think I'll ever use gavel.  Also another nice things about Spire is the proc doesn't suffer from downranking penalty so you get an additional 200 heal even on a rank 1 HW which costs 0 mana with ssc relic.<br>
<br>
Perhaps in an average case Archon's is superior to Spire however when I need HPS the most (lots of ppl close to death) Spire far outshines anything else around.  So alot more healing when I need it the most better than more healing when I don't need it as much and less when I don't imo.  Also the thought of having huge amounts of haste and getting a chain heal off every1.7s hitting 3 targets or so with the Spire proc makes me giddy.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I'd vote on Crystal Spire being better.  Looking at our WWS, I got 49 procs in 5 minutes on the Eredar Twins.  <br>
<br>
Assuming *ideal* situations, I think I get 2.23 CH cast times with 190 haste (what I was wearing).  That's 134.5 casts in 5 minutes assuming perfect casting with 0 latency.<br>
<br>
With Dark Blessing, I would have 220 haste which equates to 2.19 cast times and around 136.9 total Chain Heal casts.<br>
<br>
Round both down, and the difference in 5 minutes is 2 CH casts with perfect latency which never happens.  So in that regard, I'd easily take the Crystal Spire over Dark Blessing.  If you're downing Illidan, you can get plenty of haste in all the other spots.  The Crystal Spire proc is pretty darn amazing.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>I currently run just under 300 haste and have CH down to 2.17ish. I have always been of the opinion that the Crystal Spire was better but wanted to put out the idea here as far as comparison and see what the thought was. I do have access to a lot of different gear and there is a lot of other slots to find haste plus the new gem. <br>
<br>
When I brought up the point that most of our raid was not sub 50% there were two fights that immediately came to mind, Brutallus and the Twins (working on them still). It is nice to see that the proc never overhealed because some of the priests/paladins in our guild were saying that it does that a lot.<br>
<br>
Naturally I wanted to bring the question here and thanks for answering it which confirmed what I previously thought.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<b><font size="2">Gemming</font></b><br>
Now that we have some solid HEP values (I hope anyway) let’s take a look at gemming our best-in-slot items again.<br>
<br>
<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32195" target="_blank">[Teardrop Crimson Spinel]</a> x 4 + <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=25897" target="_blank">[Bracing Earthstorm Diamond]</a> = 88 healing + 26 healing = 114 healing = 114 HEP<br>
<br>
<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=35761" target="_blank">[Quick Lionseye]</a> x 2 + <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32216" target="_blank">[Royal Shadowsong Amethyst]</a> x 2+ <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=25901" target="_blank">[Insightful Earthstorm Diamond]</a> =  20 spell haste + 22 healing + 4 mp5 + 17.5 mp5 + 4 mp5 (socket bonuses) + 7 healing (shoulder socket bonus) + 12 Intellect<br>
= 20 spell haste + 29 healing + 25.5 mp5 +12 Intellect<br>
= 40 + 22 + 5.2 +22.75 + 5.2 +7 + 9= 111.15 HEP<br>
<br>
<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=35759" target="_blank">[Forceful Seaspray Emerald]</a> x 2 + <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32195" target="_blank">[Teardrop Crimson Spinel]</a>x 2 + <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=25901" target="_blank">[Insightful Earthstorm Diamond]</a>=+10 Haste and +4 mp5 + 17.5 mp5 +44 healing + 12 Intellect<br>
= 20 + 5.2 + 22.75 +44 + 9 = 100.95<br>
<br>
So, using all Spinels (except perhaps for the helm with the yellow slot) seems to maximize healing. However, there's a strong argument to be made for gemming with 2 Quick Lionseyes and 2 Royal Shadowsong Amethysts. By using the yellow and purple gems, you lose 85 healing but gain 20 spell haste and 25.5 mp5 and 12 Intellect. And given that there’s no cooldown on the IED and spell haste will increase the number of spells cast, a good argument could be made to gem in this manner.<br></div>

</div>I don't think water shield proc'ing a lot for certain fights makes MP5 worthless.  And just because they haven't addressed the water shield for those fights doesn't mean they won't.  <br>
<br>
As for consumables, a mana potion is only an average of 2400 mana every 2 minutes.  That's not very much.  According to this HEP table, an Elixir of Healing Power (50 HEP) is far more useful than a Flask of Mighty Restoration (32.5 HEP) so you'd never want to use MP5 consumables.<br>
<br>
I'm not saying that I can't get by on fights by chain potting but I have a decent amount of MP5 as well (152).  What I'm saying is that an HEP value of 1.3 would basically mean ignoring MP5 on gear.<br>

</div>I think there were some points made about dependability vs chance procs. It's like spell crit. Sure, it's nice to have, and it has some advantages to it, but it isn't reliable. Bracing is a constant value, while the Insightful proc is only wasted if you have 100% mana. <br>

</div>I would have to say that in the current gearing/raiding environment, if the regen you gain from gear (180mp5 would be an example from a guildie), buffs (50 from WS, 62 from Mana Spring, 25 from a flask), and consumables (~100 for a chain chugged mana pot) isn't enough for a fight, you'll probably be given a shadow priest anyway (that's roughly 430mp5, ignoring mana tide, spellsurge, WS charges or Alchy stones), or should manage your spell use a bit more carefully.<br>

</div>Find a fight in Sunwell where mana is an issue. Like Kint said, it's pretty hard to go oom in Sunwell. I can wear ~350 spell haste and less than 180mp5 (WITH watershield)and NOT have a shadowpriest and never go oom. Everything procs water shield, the hardest part is finding the time to renew it. Even without it, a mana pot will easily get you through most fights. Don't be cheap and mana won't matter. <br>
<br>
I can only really think of one fight, maybe two, in all of Black temple where I ever worry about mana at all. There is a reason the values move away from mp5. If you're having mana issues on most fights, you're doing something wrong.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Like I said, I can get by on mana-intensive fights by chain mana potting and downranking but some of it is because I try to keep my MP5 above 140.  There have been times where I was hanging around 1-2k mana and just hoping that I could survive until the next mana pot.  Last time was on Illidari Council last week.  I was assigned to the priestess tank to heal and interrupt.  Several of our healers and dps died and those of us left barely had mana to keep people alive.  No doubt in my mind that it would have been a wipe if I had less MP5.<br>
<br>
You can say, "tell your raid to learn to avoid aoe damage".  I agree but I can't play for them.<br>
<br>
Maybe the value of MP5 should be on a sliding scale.  More valuable if your MP5 is less than 120, less valuable above.  Personally, that's how I value MP5 (but I use a 140 benchmark).  If it gets too low, I try not to lose any more.  If it's too high, I try to make more HPS-type gear choices.  I just wanted to mainly point out that MP5 has a value in tier 6 content.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_717570"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->It's hard not to have MP5 though.  I'd argue the average shaman doing T6, and not wearing vengeful gladiator, would have around 140 mp5 fairly effortlessly.<br>
<br>
For instance, looking at your current armory, I see 15mp5 from following socket bonus's and purple gems.  Assuming you gem'ed for +healing instead (pure spinels, and realistically speaking, I don't think any of us did that whether it's by choice or lack of spinels in the guild bank), you'd lose that 15mp5.  Now assuming your Council fight was 8 minutes and things went south at the 4 minute mark,  (I pulled that out of my mind, I realize a lot of us do it faster than that and some slower)  your 15 MP5 is worth 15*12*4=720 additional mana.  That's not even 2 chain heals.<br>
<br>
I'd venture to say you guys surivived because your healers were conscious of the situation, and smartly adjusted your healing ranks/patterns to the situation and got you through.  Not because you had an extra 1.5 chain heals. (or HW or whatever)<br>
<br>
I mean the extra 15 mana you got from a tick might have gotten you *exactly* enough mana to cast a desperation heal at a critical conjecture.....but I'd really think that was good healing by your group and not some lucky 15 mana tick.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

A shadow priest could allow you to spam cast Rank 4 for 7 minutes or more.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">It's hard not to have MP5 though.  I'd argue the average shaman doing T6, and not wearing vengeful gladiator, would have around 140 mp5 fairly effortlessly.<br>
<br>
For instance, looking at your current armory, I see 15mp5 from following socket bonus's and purple gems.  Assuming you gem'ed for +healing instead (pure spinels, and realistically speaking, I don't think any of us did that whether it's by choice or lack of spinels in the guild bank), you'd lose that 15mp5.  Now assuming your Council fight was 8 minutes and things went south at the 4 minute mark,  (I pulled that out of my mind, I realize a lot of us do it faster than that and some slower)  your 15 MP5 is worth 15*12*4=720 additional mana.  That's not even 2 chain heals.<br>
<br>
I'd venture to say you guys surivived because your healers were conscious of the situation, and smartly adjusted your healing ranks/patterns to the situation and got you through.  Not because you had an extra 1.5 chain heals. (or HW or whatever)<br>
<br>
I mean the extra 15 mana you got from a tick might have gotten you *exactly* enough mana to cast a desperation heal at a critical conjecture.....but I'd really think that was good healing by your group and not some lucky 15 mana tick.</div>

It lasted almost 12 minutes and only 11 of us were left at the end.  I also had to use a ton of Healing Waves due to being the only priestess tank healer and the rest of the raid being spread out.  I probably should have used more downranking on the Healing Waves but we were barely keeping up as it was.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Skyhoof, what formulae do you use for calculating HEP? Where can I check them out ?<br>
Thanks for info in advance ^^<br>
<br>
------------------- SPREADSHEET REBUILD ------------------------------------------------<br>
Hey Ho Mates! <br>
<br>
I've rebuilt my healing spells spreadsheet.<br>
<br>
At the moment it calculates <b>Healing done,HPS,HPSC,HPM,MP5</b> for all valuable ranks of healing spells.<br>
In addition <b>average HPS</b> is calculated for each spell <b>over</b> different duration <b>fights</b>.<br>
New <b>"mixed" spells</b> conception was involved. <br>
Added a little of new personal preferences.<br>
<br>
New version can be downloaded here: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080421234758/http://www.divshare.com/download/4299918-ec9" target="_blank"><font size="5"><b>RSSSS_v106.rar</b></font></a>; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080421234758/http://www.divshare.com/download/4309623-1a0" target="_blank"><font size="3"><b>RSSSS_v106.zip</b></font></a> ( .zip are greater than .rar for 1.5 times)<br>
<br>
Spreadsheet is made in MS Excel 2003, i don't know if it works in OpenOffice.<br>
Spreadseet use 'iterations' function, for full functionaliy of spreadsheet you should to switch this function on in your Excel.<br>
Check the Iteration option in menu <b>Tools-&gt;Options-&gt;Calculation[Tab]–&gt;Iteration[checkbox]</b>.<br>
<br>
A little tip: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080421234758/http://www.divshare.com/download/4300890-a34" target="_blank"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080421234758im_/http://www.divshare.com/img/thumb/4300890-a34.png" border="0" alt=""></a><br>
<br>
<font size="3"><b>How to use spreadsheet:</b></font><br>
<br>
- Only <b>cyan cells are for input</b> your character information. Don't modify gray cells please<br>
<br>
1. Go to <u>"&lt;0&gt;Talents"</u> sheet and <b>set up</b> your <b>talents</b><br>
<br>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080421234758im_/http://s11.divshare.com/files/2008/04/20/4300909/talent.png" border="0" alt=""><br>
<br>
2. <b>Set up</b> your <b>relics</b>, if you use macros for swap relics when casting you can choose all 3 types. <br>
If you use only one relic always - choose only one in spreadsheet too.<br>
<br>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080421234758im_/http://s16.divshare.com/files/2008/04/20/4300898/relic.png" border="0" alt=""><br>
<br>
3. You can see below table calculated for your talent build and containing <br>
both <b>base values</b> (without +healing)of <b>HPS,HPM</b> <br>
and <b>scaling coefficients</b> for <b>HPS,HPM</b> (per +1000 healing)<br>
<br>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080421234758im_/http://s10.divshare.com/files/2008/04/20/4300900/scaling.png" border="0" alt=""><br>
<br>
4. Go to <u>"&lt;1&gt;Stats"</u> sheet and <b>enter</b> your <b>paperdoll stats</b> and external <b>sources of MP5</b><br>
<br>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080421234758im_/http://s08.divshare.com/files/2008/04/20/4300895/params.png" border="0" alt=""><br>
<br>
5. Next you can setup some <b>facultative settings</b><br>
<br>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080421234758im_/http://s10.divshare.com/files/2008/04/20/4300906/settings.png" border="0" alt=""><br>
<br>
5.1 <b>Human delays</b> were embedded in the model for closer fitting to real cast process.<br>
It isn't ping or latency (that problem has removed already from client-server transactions).<br>
It's just human reaction times and percentage of misses. I do delays about 50-100ms per cast.<br>
<br>
5.2 Setting nonzero <b>Crit UltraOverheal</b> will <b>underrate</b> crits, at least I think that crits overheal more than normal heals.<br>
5.3 Setting nonzero <b>Ancestral Bonus</b> will <b>overrate</b> crits because of ancestral procs. I don't know what actual number should be here.<br>
<br>
5.4 There is separate <b>EarthShield CritUltraOverheal</b> coeff and separate <b>spellcrit chance for Earth Shield</b>. It's caused by ES mechanics.<br>
<br>
6. Now you can see the spell efficiency table <b>Avg.Heal/HPS/HPSC/HPM/MP5/MP5edge</b>.<br>
<b>Spellcrit, haste</b>, human reaction delays, are taken in consideration.<br>
<br>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080421234758im_/http://s11.divshare.com/files/2008/04/20/4300907/spells.png" border="0" alt=""><br>
<br>
<b>HPSC</b> means Healing per second casting, it's different from HPS only for our HoT spells, HST and ES.<br>
<b>MP5</b> means MP5 required for <b>infinite spamming</b> this spell by cooldown.<br>
<b>MP5edge</b> is MP5 when <b>you get OO5SR(spirit) mana ticks</b> even when spam spell as often as you can.<br>
<br>
7. Now you can specify your typical <b>fight duration</b> in minutes in cyan cells.<br>
Spreadsheet will calculate your average <b>HPS</b> over fighs. <b>Manapool, I5SR MP5</b> and <b>OO5SR MP5</b> are taken in consideration.<br>
<br>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080421234758im_/http://s14.divshare.com/files/2008/04/20/4300892/HPS_overMin.png" border="0" alt=""><br>
<br>
This table helps us to <b>choose</b> what <b>downrank</b> is <b>optimal</b> for actual fight. You can find some sudden and interesting facts here ^^<br>
<br>
<b>Yellow</b> texts indicate maximal <b>HPS</b> for spell family, its best spell for this fight duration.<br>
<b>Brown</b> texts indicate HPS in <b>1% range</b> of maximal, <b>dark background</b> indicates spells in <b>5% range</b> of maximal.<br>
Coloring was intended just for visual usability, nothing special but easier to understand.<br>
<br>
<b>OO5SR mana regen</b> was calculated on the assumtion that delays between spellcasts are distributed <b>exponentially</b>, <br>
detailed math can be checked out at <u>"5SR%"</u> sheet.<br>
<br>
HPS in the last line doesn't correspond to "normal" spell. This is result for precalculated<b> mix of 2 spells</b> spending together <b>full manapool/mp5</b>.<br>
This mix if very demonstrative for haste effects, when your haste increases <b>"mixed"</b> spell increases both <b>HPS</b> and <b>mana efficiency</b>.<br>
Notice that "mixed" spells often are the most efficient in family.<br>
<br>
8. If you scroll sheet right you can see what actually each <b>"mixed"</b> spell means.<br>
<br>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080421234758im_/http://s09.divshare.com/files/2008/04/20/4300894/mixed.png" border="0" alt=""><br>
<br>
There are displayed <b>two spell names and weights</b>, <br>
if you cast these spells in this proportion you will have results equivalent to "mixed" spell.<br>
<br>
That's all concerning description <br>
<br>
<br>
I'm open for dialog. If anyone needs more explaination or doesnt agree with something just ask me.<br>
Also I'm interested what you think about spreadsheet, it may be worth to add some specific here.<br>
If I miss something or something is incorrect tell me please, I will add/correct it.<br>
<br>
Skyhoof, i remember you said something about T5/6 set bonuses. Could you post here what actually these bonuses do? I'm going to include it.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_718461"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Thank you, very useful indeed. <br>
<br>
Spreadsheet is totally line with results that I have got while chain spamming raid and pretty much confirms that haste stacking isn't only way to go. Obtaining over 3k HPS is totally viable both ways at this point of game and mainly comes down what tactics or healing setups are used on boss encounters.<br>
<br>
Haste consumes your mana also faster making MP5 more important stat to have. Mostly if you have a shadow priest it isn't an issue but I would not personally recommend people totally skip MP5, specially if fights last longer than 6 minutes (and SP could die also, what then?).<br>
<br>
So, a little bit haste, some +heal and then drop of MP5 with nice balanced mix and you have a great shaman.<br>
<br>
Side note, did break today first time 2.9k HPS on brutallus, resulting over 1million healed and was wearing only 6% haste.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>It's nice trinket and considering using it on short fights, but the thing with CH is that, the most effective part of your heals are additional jumps. Are people gimping +heal too much and loosing then most of chain heal potential? What is the difference when you can cast 0.15s faster with +2300 vs +2700 heal buffed what comes to those additional jumps (CH4 and CH5)? In most cases primary cast produce some over healing, jumps not so much regardless how much +heal you have.<br>
<br>
I'm not saying that haste is bad, it's excellent no doubt about it, but when focus has turned to recommend ZA amulet over Sunwell one I see that haste is valued maybe a bit too much over other stats.<br>
<br>
About that trinket, I would value it like HEP numbers indicate, 80 or 88 HEP witch make Memento better purely healing wise.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I reversed engineered the HEP values. Let's say we all agree that X, Y and Z are the best items in the game. Well, how would you have to value their stats to arrive at the conclusion? Then, I take those values for something like +healing and plug them into Binkenstein's Shamstats to derive the other values and to make sure the values are correct in relationship to one another. It's mainly a lot of trial and error. <br>

</div>I checked Shamstats and found there calculations of HEP equivalents for each stat. Do you use these equivalency coefficients directly or make some euristic precalculations before?<br>
Actually i don't understand clearly sentence 'take values for something like +healing'. What does it actually mean?<br>

</div>In my opinion that method is horribly flawed. HEP values are supposed to let you know which items are better, reverse engineering items that you think are the best to make the HEP values is not the way to do it. It's almost as bad as using the itemization cost of stats as your HEP system... Just the fact blizzard gives an item a higher budget and more stats doesn't automatically make it better. Some items are just made to be bad and just becuase they drop in BT/sunwell/whatever isn't an automatic sign of their goodness.<br>
<br>
In general, looking at how much each stat actaully increases your ability to heal, using your current gear as a baseline, is the way to go. Yes it's rediculessly complicated but there's no way around it if you want a better HEP system than a "we just looked at the best items and made an HEP system that will make you choose those as the best items".<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I was surprised how bad these were compared to their cloth/leather counterparts.  Hopefully they bumped the healing up to 84ish or put a red socket on it.<br>
<br>
I haven't found an updated stat sheet for them yet on the net (I've been looking on and off today).  Hopefully once the PTR comes up, somebody will give us an update on them.<br>
<br>
The Akama gloves are also poorly itemized versus their cloth/leather cousins as well IMHO.  If anybody gets on the PTR and has these gloves, can you let us know if these are better itemized as well (maybe they just forgot to mention them in the notes....here's to wishfull thinking)<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

If so, the first thread post/wiki contradict the current behavior.<br>
<br>
Allso, with your new HEP values:<br>
<br>
Super Mana Oil = 14mp5 * 1.3 = 18HEP<br>
Brilliant Mana Oil = 12mp5 * 1.3 + 25 healing = 41HEP<br>
Super Wizard Oil = 42 healing  =42HEP (erroneous tooltip does not mention it does healing &amp; damage)<br>
<br>
With these HEP it seems clear Super Mana oil is vastly inferior to the 2 that give +healing.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_723647"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Due to being very bored and Me liking healing I am tempted to reroll a shaman (I have a pretty geared 70 priest alt allready, so up to council I know what to heal)<br>
Because our guild like any alliance guild struggles for shaman The possibility might excist for me to make this swap.<br>
<br>
I have been reading this topic for a while now. but Am I correct in assuming that going the haste route when you will basicly be "powered geared" isnt smart?<br>
My guild isnt tempted to give shaman a shadowpriest, and I will have very crap gear so having a ton of haste with semi-low healing and mp5 doesnt seem optimal to me.<br>
Badge items will get me a long way, but are there any other very good items ?<br>
<br>
This is what I came up with as realistic starter plan, IF i decide to go ahead with this:<br>

</div>It isn't smart, but you can't go this way in practice.<br>
<br>
Entry level items don't have much haste. Maybe if you'd farm ZA exclusively, but skipping Kara/badges or T6 (if your guild will power you through it - happens all the time on our server) is stupid. <br>
<br>
And as you're making an alt, get alchemy and leatherworking and spam consumables (Super Mana pots with Alchemist's Stone and Drums of Restoration).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<!-- message -->
		<div id="post_message_723814"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Here are a few changes/additions I was thinking of making to the Wiki:<br>
<br>
<b>Chain Heal &amp; Shaman Elementals:</b><br>
<br>
Shaman get both a Fire Elemental and Earth Elemental. Each has a 20-minute cooldown and you cannot summon them both at the same time (2-minute delay).<br>
<br>
Elementals are not considered part of the party/raid/group. Therefore, chain heal will not bounce to Elementals if you first target a raid member for healing. However, if you first target an Elemental, chain heal will bounce to members of the raid. <br>
<br>
<b>Consumables:</b><br>
<br>
Will add <a class="q1" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=13511" target="_blank">[Flask of Distilled Wisdom]</a>, which grants 975 mana, 19.5 healing with the talent Nature’s Blessing and 0.93% spell crit.<br>
<br>
Will add <a class="q1" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=22522" target="_blank">[Superior Wizard Oil]</a>, which also grants +42 healing (tooltip is wrong about it being only +damage).<br>
<br>
<b>Trinkets</b><br>
<br>
Trinkets that grant additional +healing upon use generally cannot be used at the same time as another trinket with a similar effect. However, there are some exceptions, most notably: <a class="q2" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=25634" target="_blank">[Oshu'gun Relic]</a> and <a class="q2" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30293" target="_blank">[Heavenly Inspiration]</a>. On-use +healing trinkets can be used at the same time as a +damage trinket.<br>
<br>
For example, to supercharge your Earth Shield or Healing Stream Totem:<br>
<br>
<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33828" target="_blank">[Tome of Diabolic Remedy]</a> + <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=19950" target="_blank">[Zandalarian Hero Charm]</a> = 804 healing<br>
<br>
<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33828" target="_blank">[Tome of Diabolic Remedy]</a> + <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=29376" target="_blank">[Essence of the Martyr]</a> = 693 healing<br>
<br>

<br>
<b>Chain Heal &amp; Shaman Elementals:</b><br>
<br>
Shaman get both a Fire Elemental and Earth Elemental. Each has a 20-minute cooldown and you cannot summon them both at the same time (2-minute delay).<br>
<br>
Elementals are not considered part of the party/raid/group. Therefore, chain heal will not bounce to Elementals if you first target a raid member for healing. However, if you first target an Elemental, chain heal will bounce to members of the raid. <br></div>

</div>Hmm interesting for a long time all my +heal trinkets didn't stack together.  I never got Remedy though.  I wonder if Diabolic Remedy is a oversight on Blizzards part.  I remember when Hex Head stacked with other dmg trinkets until Blizzard fixed it.  If anyone else has alot of click +heal trinkets to test together maybe we can figure out which ones do and don't stack.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				beSch is a Restoration Shaman addon which tracks your watershield and earthshield in a minimalistic way.<br>
<br>
You get 2 Numbers and a Name thats all.<br>
Left number and name belong to your earthshield and the current, and last, target on which earthshield was active.<br>
The right number is your watershield count.<br>
<br>
The addon is currently tracking the 2.4 combatlog events to retrieve information. There is no scanning of your or the earthshield targets aura.<br>
<br>
The configuration needs to be done via LUA editing!<br>
You there can set colors, font settings, position and so on.<br>
Also Chat or Audio notification is implemented and can be configured in the core.lua<br>
<br>
This addon is not so final that i can say the counter is always 100% correct.<br>
For any ideas, help or error reports thanks in advance!<br>
<br>
Greetings

<br>
Is the LW crafted loot along with the drums of restoration out weight alch?<br>
<br>
I believe the drums by themselves can make up for the alch stone since I always sit in a SP + 3x mage group and none of the are LWs either, so I can restore more mana for them as well.<br>

P.S. I my guild is working on BT/Hyjal, and I've hit 70 about 2.5 - 3 weeks ago, but geared up pretty fast. I currently sit at 1930ish +healing and 220ish unbuffed MP5. The trinkets I'm using are Eye of Gruul and Battlemaster's Perseverance.

</div>A proper drum group will get 125 mp5 per member in the group. I don't care how many potions you drink you won't come even close to that with alchemy. <br>
If you are really interested in min maxing you should get LW as it is the superior raiding profession bare none, not only you but as many raid members as possible, that's how broken drums currently are.<br>

		<div id="post_message_725652"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->The change would be a small reduction in healing done but not enough to make those using Tier 2 stop using it. It can provide a significant boost to healing done -- depending on your current gear in the slots in which you equip Tier 2. <br>
<br>
I no longer use Tier 2. The gear I would give up just has too many stats and too much haste. Anyone find Tier 2 helpful in Sunwell, perhaps on Brutallis?<br>
=================<br>
<font size="3">Raw Healing</font><br>
X = base healing on first target<br>
<br>
<b>Without Tier 2</b><br>
X + 0.50X + 0.25X = 1.75X<br>
<br>
<b>Current Tier 2</b><br>
X + 0.65X + 0.4225X= 2.0725X<br>
<br>
<b>Patch 2.4.2</b><br>
<br>
X + 0.625 X + .3910 X = 2.0156 X<br>
<br>
So Tier 2 boosts chain healing by 18.4% now and 15.2% after the patch.<br>
======================<br>
<br>
<font size="3">Factoring in Overhealing</font><br>
Now Thud00 determined with a custom mod that the overhealing on the initial jump was about 50% and overhealing on subsequent jumps was about 20%.<br>
<br>
<b>Without Tier 2</b><br>
X*0.50 + 0.50X *0.80+ 0.25X*0.80 = 1.1X<br>
<br>
<b>Current Tier 2</b><br>
X*0.50 + 0.65X*0.80 + 0.4225X*0.80= 1.358X<br>
<br>
<b>Patch 2.4.2</b><br>
<br>
X *0.50+ 0.625 X*0.80 + .3910 X*0.80 = 1.3128 X<br>
<br>
So Tier 2 boosts healing by 23.5% now and 19.3% after the patch if overhealing is taken into account.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_726545"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I've tried to do reverse engineering of <b>shamstats110208.xls</b> for extracting some information about HEP used in this thread.<br>
<br>
I describe now what i've got, tell me please if i'm wrong with something.<br>
<br>
<b><font color="DarkRed">Calculation conditions:</font></b><br>
1. We assume that healer use only maximal ranks of spells (HW,CH,LHW)<br>
2. We assume that there is fixed proportion of casts: HW=20%, CH=70%, LHW=10%<br>
3. We assume that healer heals till OOM and stop healing.<br>
<br>
<b><font color="#8b0000">Next we start calculating weight:</font></b><br>
First "Hps Equivalence Points" calculated, it's pre HEP values;<br>
HpsEP for some stat just means how much our hps increases if we increase this stat to 1;<br>
Unit of HpsEP(stat) magnitude is [h/s]/[unit of stat];<br>
At the end HEP are found as normalized HpsEP under the condition that HEP(+healing)=1.0;<br>
<br>
So what i can see concerning <b><font color="#8b0000">HpsEP calculations</font></b>:<br>
<br>
<b><font color="#008000">(Base) </font></b>Calculate our HPS0 under conditions listed above. It will be base value.<br>
<br>
<b><font color="#008000">(+Healing)</font></b> Increase +healing per 1, calculate modified hps, calculate difference with base. It is HpsEP value for +healing.<br>
HpsEP(+healing)=(HPS1-HPS0)/(1_of_healing); Unit is [HpsEP(+healing)] = [(h/s-h/s)/h] = [(h/s)/h];<br>
<br>
<b><font color="#008000">(+CritRating)</font></b> Increase Crit per 1%, calculate modified hps, calculate difference with base, divide result by equivalent critrating. It is HpsEP value for CritRating.<br>
HpsEP(+critrating)=(HPS1-HPS0)/(Equal_critrating); Unit is [HpsEP(+critrating)] = [(h/s-h/s)/cr] = [(h/s)/cr];<br>
<br>
<b><font color="#008000">(+HasteRating)</font></b> Increase Haste per 1%, calculate modified hps, calculate difference with base one, divide result by equivalent haste. It is HpsEP value for HasteRating.<br>
HpsEP(+hasterating)=(HPS1-HPS0)/(Equal_hasterating); Unit is [HpsEP(+hasterating)] = [(h/s-h/s)/hr] = [(h/s)/hr];<br>
<br>
<b><font color="#008000">(+MP5)</font></b> Calculate some Value = HPS/(5*Manacost), next calculate percentage for non casting time, multiply them and get HpsEP.<br>
Final experssion is: HpsEP(+mp5) = HPS/(5*Manacost)* ( 1 - CastingTime/FightTime );<br>
Unit is: [HpsEP(+mp5)] = [ (h/s) / m ];<br>
Unit should be [(h/s)/(m/s)].<br>
In my humble opinion it's <b><u>incorrect</u></b> because of wrong unit.<br>
I can't write any formula for HpsEP(+mp5) under these conditions and can explain it:<br>
We heal by max ranks till OOM and additional MP5 doesn't give us any HPS boost.<br>
<br>
<b><font color="#008000">(+Mana)</font></b> Calculate some Value = HPS/(5*Manacost), next calculate HpsEP(+Mana)=Value/FightTime=HPS/(5*Manacost*FightTime);<br>
Units of this magnitude [HpsEP(+Mana)]=[h/(s*m*s)]=[ (h/s)/m/s ];<br>
It seems <b><u>incorrect</u></b> too because of wrong unit.<br>
It should be [(h/s)/m] as for other HpsEPs, so i think right formula is (assuming we have correct HpsEP(+mana)):<br>
HpsEP(+mana)= HpsEP(+mp5) * ( ( 1 mana / CastTime ) / 5 / ( 1 mana ) =  HpsEP(+mp5)/(5*CastTime);<br>
Unit is [HpsEP(+mana)]=[ (h/s) / (m/s) / s ] = [(h/s)/m] ;<br>
<br>
<b><font color="#008000">(+Spirit)</font></b> Calculate equivalence between mp5 and spi taking in consideration 10% time OO5SR.<br>
HpsEP(+Spi)=HpsEP(+MP5)*(MP5_equal/SPI_equal);<br>
Unit is [HpsEP(+Spi)]=[HpsEP(+MP5)] * [(m/s)/spi] = [(h/s)/(m/s) * (m/s)/spi] = [(h/s)/spi];<br>
<b><u>Possible mistake</u></b>: always zero multiplier in calculation.<br>
Note: Can be calculated only if we know correct HpsEP(+MP5)<br>
<br>
<b><font color="Green">(+Int) </font></b>Weighted summ of HpsEP for Mana, Crit and Healing.<br>
HpsEP(+Int) = HpsEP(+healing)*(healing_equal/Int_equal) + HpsEP(+Mana)*(Mana_equal/Int_equal) + HpsEP(+Critrating)*(Critrating_equal/Int_equal);<br>
If units of all HpsEP are correct the unit for [HpsEP(+Int)]=[(h/s)/int];<br>
<b><u>Possible mistakes</u></b>: <br>
- HEP used instead of HpsEP for +Healing<br>
- Summ is calculated only for HW values. All other final values calculate for HW=20%, CH=70%, LHW=10%<br>
Note: Can be calculated only if we know correct HpsEP(+Mana)<br>
<br>
<b><font color="#8b0000">As a conclusion</font></b> <br>
<br>
If i'm right in my description, our current HEP <b>correctly</b> reflects all healing-burst stats: Healing,CritRating,HasteRating<br>
And it is <b>incorrect</b> with healing-efficiency stats such as: MP5, Mana, Spirit.<br>
HpsEP(+Int) is <b>semi-correct.</b><!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Firstly, those percentage breakdowns were for the user to say roughly what % of their spell use is LHW/HW/CH, to give me something to work with.<br>

To be honest, I have never been satisfied with how I was handling mp5 &amp; mana. However, I am fairly confident that I've got it ironed out with the new version of SEIC, from which I will most likely covert into a resto version as well, adding in downranking options as I go.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I'm curious, the tooltip on superior wizard oil is incorrect and it adds to healing as well as damage, has anyone tried a flask of supreme power to see if the tooltip on this is incorrect as well? If it does add to healing as well as damage, I think it would be the best flask for resto shaman to use.<br>

</div>Shouldn't the wiki provide some kind of RSS feed on its changes? At least there propably is an addon for this.<br>

PS: I just recognized the Think Tank actually isn't a regular wiki but part of the forum. You could try using the subscription feature found in "Article Tools", but I actually do not know if editing a post will trigger the messages.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>
