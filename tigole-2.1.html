It sounds like they are addressing most of the concerns that have been brought up by the raiding community.  Whether or not their fixes will be successful remains to be seen.  Sounds like the patch is at least 3-4 weeks away.</div>

				Lately, I’ve been seeing a lot of posts about the same subjects – subjects that have been addressed in an upcoming patch – so I wanted to let you guys know where things stood. <br>
<br>
The Rogue Situation <br>
<br>
We’ve done a tuning pass of many of our dungeons/bosses/encounters to ensure that nothing overly punishing occurs to “melee DPS’ that would lead people to favor ranged DPS over Rogues/DPS Warriors etc. <br>
<br>
Also, we’ve changed the NPC cleave mechanic so that it’s now a frontal cone ability rather than a 360 degree chain attack. Sweeping Strikes has been removed from all Burning Crusade NPC’s. <br>
We’re also reducing the Glancing Blow damage penalty for creatures 1-3 levels higher than the player. This will have a significant effect on melee DPS as it relates to endgame melee dps. More details on this at a later time. <br>
<br>
End Game Itemization <br>
<br>
As we’ve stated before, we made a lot of improvements to endgame gear progression. To put it in perspective, take a look at this Warrior Tanking Breastplate from before and after. <br>
<br>
Destroyer Chestguard – Currently <br>
+24 Strength <br>
+22 Agility <br>
+39 Stamina <br>
Blue Socket <br>
Yellow Socket <br>
Red Socket <br>
Socket Bonus +6 Stamina <br>
Equip: Increases Defense Rating by 23 <br>
Equip: Increases your dodge rating by 16 <br>
Equip: Improves hit rating by 18 <br>
<br>
Destroyer Chestguard – Patch 2.1.0 <br>
+21 Strength <br>
+22 Agility <br>
+51 Stamina <br>
Blue Socket <br>
Yellow Socket <br>
Red Socket <br>
Socket Bonus +6 Stamina <br>
Equip: Increases Defense Rating by 23 <br>
Equip: Increases your dodge rating by 20 <br>
Equip: Improved hit rating by 20 <br>
<br>
<br>
”Trash” Concerns <br>
<br>
Equally interesting yet non-epic-dropping non-bosses (or “Trash” as he community likes to call it) has been of concern lately on these forums. In all of our 25 person raid zones we’ve made a number of bug fixes and tuning adjustments. For example, the trash should be significantly easier to clear in most cases – and take less time. Also, we’ve lengthened the time between respawn on a lot of the trash. Yes, trash will respawn in some cases. It’s a pacing mechanic and one that works well when tuned correctly. For example, the trash before the Prophet Skeram or the trash before Attumen the Huntsmen or the Maiden of Virtue works well. You get a couple of tries on the boss, and if you fail, you spend a short time re-clearing. Yes, there are cases of the trash respawning too fast or the trash being too difficult or too lengthy. Those are the cases we hope to fix. We’ve also fixed some bugs that were allowing the trash to respawn after the boss for a certain area was dead. <br>
<br>
Consumables <br>
<br>
We’re making substantial changes to the way certain consumables work . In particular, Flasks and Elixirs are going to undergo major changes. More information will be available later on. We want Flasks and Elixirs to be a part of the game. We want alchemy to be a cool, needed profession. But we want to remove the tedium and cost from the massive consumable farming that’s going on for endgame raiding. We’ll provide more information soon – but for now, expect big changes to Flasks and Elixirs. <br>
<br>
Boss Tuning <br>
<br>
We’re looking at the boss tuning from dungeons to heroics to raids. Your feedback is being listened to. <br>
<br>
To Summarize <br>
<br>
We’re making big improvements to the game. Whenever possible, we hotfix changes to get them to you as quickly as possible. Unfortunately, there are many changes that require a patch and cannot be hotfixed. Many of these changes are coming in Patch 2.1.0. The patch will be on PTR’s in the upcoming weeks. You’ll be able to see them there and try them out for yourselves. You’ll also be able to test Black Temple. We’re also looking into ways of making Hyjal accessible on the PTR as well to get more testing on that zone. <br>
<br>
I can assure you that we’re aware of the issues you guys are discussing on the boards and we’re listening closely. We’re also dedicated fans of the game ourselves. We play it every day =D We will affect change as quickly as we can. Patch 2.1.0 will be on the PTR soon enough and you’ll all have the opportunity to comment and make suggestions on the changes

If they made Elixer last through death that wouldn't be so bad. Or not allow the stacking of Flask/Elixers that would also help. On easy bosses you can just Elixer up for cheap mats.<br>

Atleast it's postive to see them learning from the clusterfuck that is SSC/TK and opening up Hyjal Testing along with Black temple hopefully this leads to more tuned/Polished Encounters</div>

On another note I agree with another post that Elixirs should last through death. The way I'd like to see it done would be. In order to make elixir last through death it would require 2 extra of each plant used along with another plant, something like useless plant Ragveil x 10. Then that plant would not be so useless. In practice mini-flasks.</div>

It's nice to see something finally, and who knows, maybe these will be the magical fixes to everything. It still doesn't change the fact that they need a whole community of players to scream at them before they get to changing something as mindbogglingly out of control as consumables. They should be seeing these problems beforehand on their own.<br>
<br>
Maybe with 2.1 WoW the raid game will again be just as attractive as it used to be, but this whole ordeal has left me just a little distrustful of their conduct in the future.</div>

Would of been better to see an example of an item worse for wear on budget than this, but still its an atleast a step in the right direction, add another 10sta and some bonus armor and it comes quite nicely close to budget.<br>

Edit: doesn't seem to be any bonus armor on it (odd?), anyway so its still 10 ilvls short, but better than 20<br>

@ Malan they need to create a dummy attunement method instead of one that currently exists is all, BT however they can start without adding it in so people can test the content. I very highly doubt there will be an ability to -leap frog- up past the old content to get there, unless ofcourse they make you unable to brute force it thanks to the consumable nerf/itemization buff.</div>

It sounded like it would be frontal cone, but still chain, and therefore making it non directional anyway, since it ALWAYS will bounce off the MT, and then chain behind the boss anyway.

</div>
<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->Obviously this depends on the implementation, but I think we can assume there is something to the german client/poster's stacked implications.  Still, this is so ambiguous its hard to say anything.  You can actually "limit" consumables, and make matters worse... just like halving raid size, and stacking is twice as important.  <br>
<br>
<br>
I hate to be the standard reply to blue that "this is great news!"  And just carry on like the world has been saved because we finally heard something.<br>
<br>
But 1.  We finally have some decent communication, and one of the largest issues (trash), is being addressed.  <br>
2.  Melee tuning will extend beyond just the simplistic and mostly worthless cleave changes (although that needed a fix also).  <br>
3.  Consumables are up in the air, ultimate tuning is up in the air.<br>
<br>
Depending on tuning, many guilds may still be left in the dust.  We shall see.  We're limited by the amount of content available, and as I said, and as the thread about what I said has discussed over and over and over... if you have a lack of content, only creativity in using what you already have (read: nerfing the hard stuff, or buffing the easy stuff) is how you keep that progression for everyone.<br>
<br>
I'm assuming they're going to nerf SSC... its probably a valid assumption considering Hydross is way too hard for Joe Raider; sorry Joe - no offense.  <br>
<br>
This is still a sweeping problem, but not one that can be readily hotfixed, as it is more of a content concern, unless they really just fix everything in one go... unlikely, but we've seen similar tuning to raid zones in rapid fire.  <br>
<br>
Finally, the itemization is clearly better... but its really nowhere near good enough for a T5 chest imho.  Its a step in the right direction... a "good start."  However, there are so many items that are straight to shard... Hydross loot for instance... good lord.  Its just a shame to down a fun boss, and have that enjoyment ruined by looking at loot that is just absolutely terrible, and literally not an upgrade for anyone.  <br>
<br>
Anyway, a good start is the best way to summarize this.  Communication at blizzard is generally sorely lacking, so we all applaud at even the slightest amount of feedback.  But there is so much to be done.  As praetorian said, nothing in 2.1 will address everything, its going to be a bit of a road.  Still, things could certainly be going faster...  <br>
<br>
Sounds like bureaucracy to some extent...  The bureaucracy involved in shitting this expansion up in the raid game should be reallocated downward, and new blood put in control of those resources.  They can, even with the expansion, have these things tuned and in on time.  This HAS been done better in the past... by them, and others.  I know blizzard employees work hard and all that, but come on - if Tigole has the right answer and isn't allowed to implement it, then fire or get rid of that blockade.  If Tigole doesn't have the right answer, then he's the problem.  But there is clearly a problem, and ignoring it is going to lead to this same shitstorm over and over again.  I know the general reaction once everything is OK is to forget about it and call it even.  But I just think this cycle is ridiculous... it kills the game, it causes people to quit... friends and family that quit long ago would still be here had things been tuned from the get-go.  Lots to do at R&amp;D... good luck Jeff.  Nice post.</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->The usual argument against this is that they don't want to get people's hopes up til something is set in stone. Every once in a while, Blizzard will post an idea or a timetable, that for whatever reason ends up getting scrapped. Then, .01 seconds after the proposed deadline, the forums erupt in a chorus of "ZOMG LIEZ!!!!" posts. After getting burned by this a few times, they've chosen to swing to the other end of the spectrum and just keep entirely silent.<br>

Although I personally think it would be awesome to read regular updates from the dev team, I can see where they're coming from.</div>

Seems to me this means that BT does not have significant keying process, whereas Hyjal of course does since it requires Vash and Kael kills. The keying being the part they'd have to "look into" in order to put Hyjal on the PTR and allow *everyone* access to it.</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->Druid main tank and a bit of lead time gives the warrior a great bit of buffer. Salvation is assumed, as well. KTM makes most of this sort of thing relatively trivial. At 1.1k DPS, assuming a straight 1-1 DPS:TPS ratio, berserker stance + salvation puts the warrior at 616 TPS. Our druid hangs around in the 700+ range pretty easily.<br>
<br>
As a rogue, I VERY rarely have to use my threat control abilities in raiding environments. I generally only have to if I am undisciplined and jump the gun too early, which is a player problem, not a class limitation.<br>
<br>
Edit: The only place I can think of where Vanish's threat wipe is a huge advantage every single time is on the Curator during Evoc due to the non-scaling nature of warrior tank threat as damage taken increases. Vanish just before the Evoc lets me pop AR and beat the hell out of him with reckless abandon. A warrior couldn't do that as carelessly.</div>

		<div id="post_message_316664" class="post_message_underline">While it's definitely reassuring that they recognize these issues, one of the largest problems plaguing the game currently is this stupidly long patch cycle.  Most of us already knew in the back of our heads that there was no way they were going to let some of these things continue.  Sure, reading the post makes me feel pretty good so it's a success in that respect.<br>
<br>
If my memory serves me correctly, they did state in the past they were working towards changing the model more towards smaller/quicker patches than these huge mega patches.  I wonder what happened with that.<br>
<br>
There's no reason why some of these fixes should wait until Black Temple and Hyjal testing which is a mammoth task in itself.  I'm having a hard time grasping the concept of these super massive sweeping mega change patches.</div>

But they can't just make a spreadsheet like mine and have it spit out a number for boss HP because only Nihilum would be able to kill it. No one performs to their max potential, in fact in a lot of casual guilds there are people who perform as low as perhaps half their potential. Where do you draw the line? What is too easy, what is too hard? Difficult to answer. Obviously they didn't get it right the first time. So give them some time to testing and get it <i>right</i> the second time.<br>

		<div id="post_message_316675" class="post_message_underline">My understanding is that potions are changing so that you can no longer stack flasks and elixirs.  You will have to choose between two elixirs OR one flask.  The elixirs also are split into combat and protection, so for example you can't stack two DPS elixirs - only a DPS one and a protection (frost/nature/stoneshield/etc). <br>
<br>
So for example a shadow priest could pop a distilled wisdom or supreme power, but then they can not use any elixirs (adepts, shadow power, etc).  Or they can pop a shadow power and a shadow protection, but not shadow power + adepts.  Tanks can pop a titans but then can't use stoneshield + stats elixirs, or even protection elixirs.<br>
<br>
This is from an internal test build a few weeks old, so it may change before release, but IMO it makes sense.  It is going to make some people angry and obviously requires retuning of many (if not all) fights, but over the long term this is the right solution.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Those were obvious... and don't account for being able to do more DPS than rogues without pulling aggro. Heh I watch our enhancement shaman go splat all the time from 800-850 DPS range which currently have aggro mechanics broken for melee so don't have the extra 20% melee reduction (meaning aorund 1050 DPS should be possible if you do).<br>
<br>
Then again I'm basing this on Morogrim which has a few threat issues due to Tidal Wave slowing the MT's autoattack so any fight not aggro sensitive at all I guess it would be possible.</div>

</div>
<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->The added aggro from Unleashed Rage was fixed already.  Also, shaman have Spirit Weapons which is 15% reduced threat.  While not as good as rogue's 29%, I think that's meant to penalize shaman because they are hybrids.  If that makes any sense?  Essentially rogues are pure DPS so give them -29% threat.  Warriors are pure melee, but not necessarily pure DPS so give them -20%.  And shaman have the option of speccing for healing, melee, or casting so only give them -15%.  Paladins - you guys are fucked sorry <br>
<br>
The only problem with enchancement shaman is they are very very streaky unlike warriors that can throttle their aggro.  The only protection shaman have is waiting longer than everyone else before attacking in case they get their insane windfury streak procs that would pull aggro if they started attacking too early.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">My understanding is that potions are changing so that you can no longer stack flasks and elixirs.  You will have to choose between two elixirs OR one flask.  The elixirs also are split into combat and protection, so for example you can't stack two DPS elixirs - only a DPS one and a protection (frost/nature/stoneshield/etc).</div>

Group stacking has a huge impact on caster dps and it has a big impact on rogue dps. You can't just stack a caster group for max dps and then expect rogues to hang with them. Likewise you can't stack a melee group and then expect casters to keep up. Barring very high armor/mobility/cleave fights.<br>
<br>
Reducing cleaves = good<br>
Reducing glancing = good<br>
<br>
Looking past Gruul and even post nerf Gruul rogues are doing much better dps. You can't focus on one fight to determine the viability of classes. I mean lets look at shade of aran for rogue dps and then complain that casters can't keep up.</div>

I'm not a huge fan of sockets as they're implemented, but I think this isn't a *terrible* approximation (especially given that most people just stack their favorite stat and ignore the socket bonus).

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->The item calculator in question is linked in my sig. Note all the disclaimers on the right side of it's page before you go jumping in. <br>
<br>
If one uses the calculator "as is", then the New Destroyer T5 Chest comes out to Item Level 110, which is an improvement of about 9 ilvls. However, my formula gives all sockets a very low item budget cost -- adding 8 of a random, not-in-use stat. However, if you are very demanding in giving sockets a cost, the new Destroyer chest actually comes in over budget.<br>
<br>
Let's take the old chest and socket it with +8 Hit, +12 Stam, and +8 Agi (for simplicity's sake, since those are all not-terrible gems for a tank.)<br>
<br>
Old Destroyer T5 Tank Chest, Socketed:<br>
<br>
24 Str<br>
30 Agi<br>
57 Stam<br>
23 Def<br>
16 Dodge<br>
24 Hit<br>
<br>
That comes out to an item level of 115, just 5 below the stated ilevel. This is charging the highest reasonable cost for sockets and including the socket bonus, but whatever. Now lets look at the new chest piece, socketed the same way, with +8 Agi, +12 Stam, and +8 Hit.<br>
<br>
21 Str<br>
30 Agi<br>
69 Stam<br>
23 Def<br>
20 Dodge<br>
28 Hit<br>
<br>
That chest piece comes out to an item level of 124.5. So either they are raising the item levels, or sockets are being calculated at a much lower cost than before. I've made a few passes at trying to figure out what the real formula is, but without making much progress. =/<br>
<br>
Anyway, that's the scoop. It is definitely at least on par for what a Tier 5 chest should be at ilvl 120.</div>

Aran is a fluke among raid bosses. Low Armor, no PBAoEs that hit melee only, and Blizzards that force the Ranged to move and stop DPSing, giving a safe spot to the melee in the center. How many other bosses are the exact opposite of that? If they aren't going to change the encounter design philosophy, then they need to change the class PvE mechanics somehow.</div>

<br>
 vs <br>
<br>
Seems to me this means that BT does not have significant keying process, whereas Hyjal of course does since it requires Vash and Kael kills. The keying being the part they'd have to "look into" in order to put Hyjal on the PTR and allow *everyone* access to it.</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->If the gear from Hyjal isn't needed, I can see most people skipping right to Black Temple. Most will be avoiding the lengthty farming process to get 25+ people of the right raid composition ready to go into Hyjal. However, the additional stam on the warrior chest piece is probably a clue to what is needed as we move on as the other stats had slight changes....and since there will be a consumable change, gear upgrades may be more valuable than they are now. <br>
<br>
Since Tier 6 is reported to be in Hyjal/BT, I'm not sure what linear progression they have in mind anymore. It also makes me wonder about the amount of bosses in the two zones combined. The BT video tour I caught online didn't make the place look all that big with only a few defined areas that looked like Boss zones.....although it didn't have any of the underground part of it......but it looked like a zone that could be full of many trash pulls.<br>
<br>
Hopefully Tigole still reads this forum and sees the opinion the raiding community has about the Hyjal attunement....and hopefully the April Fool's day joke is a hint that they read all of our complaints.</div>

The only real time rage is an issue is when you are tanking in a multimob environment, esp if you are non-prot.

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->The hit is fine for both types of dpsers, or atleast the difference is not so 'major' as you seem to make it out to be. Using <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111110132149/http://www.lossendil.com/wws/?report=bq5av2qakqxjc&amp;a=14" target="_blank">this</a> for basic data.<br>
60%~ is white damage (24% miss) and around 40% is yellow damage (6% miss rate, correct me if wrong) for a Rogue (windfury is present).<br>
<br>
White damage (14.4% [24*0.6]) + yellow damage (2.4% [6*0.4]) comes out as 16.8% hit needed on average, thats moderately close to the 17% casters need correct? so the disparity there is not as much of a huge issue as you think. Im not saying that as gospel but it is a simple relation that you should be able to understand.<br>
I personally only ever had around 18-19% hit on my rogue, which should be equal to about 13% for casters.<br>
<br>
I'll not touch on the glancing/unavoidable-resist issue but both have no counters and are simply annoying, I honestly cant recall enough mostly-factual figures to work out if they are equal or not currently.</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->I won't dive into resist issues as I don't have any raiding experience with them. However, glancing blows needed to be fixed first as we lost our only way to reduce the damage reduction penalty with the introduction of 2.0. This change, in theory, should bring all melee dps back to where they should have been with proper itemization.  However, we will most likely still have a static penalty across the board after the change and no way to change it as we progress.

				<div style="font-style:italic">I won't dive into resist issues as I don't have any raiding experience with them. However, glancing blows needed to be fixed first as we lost our only way to reduce the damage reduction penalty with the introduction of 2.0. This change, in theory, should bring all melee dps back to where they should have been with proper itemization.  However, we will most likely still have a static penalty across the board after the change and no way to change it as we progress. Both the amount of glancing blows and the reduction in damage are hard capped and this fix doesn't seem to address that issue.</div>

		<div id="post_message_316863" class="post_message_underline">While this is indeed the step in the right direction one can't help but to wonder why they take this same step so often to reverse what they've done with the addition of one thing or another to the game. There's the zanzas: added, buffed and nerfed. There are nerfed dungeon endbosses: Ragnaros, Nefarian, C'thun, Nightbane, Gruul, Magtheridon, Vashj. The only endgame boss which hasn't gotten nerfed to my recollection has been Kel'Thuzad - a fight which I personally found very enjoyable.<br>
<br>
Overtuning end bosses I can live with but overtuning trash is just ridiculous. Taking months to fix it is almost unforgivable. When faced with TBC endgame in a guild with 20 hours of 25-man raiding per week I've been forced to conclude that raiding is no longer fun. It's the same old except with more farming, more trash and less bosses. I think there are a few great encounters in TBC such as Aran and Nightbane. A lot of Karazhan encounters are entertaining and newly tuned Magtheridon is very nice also.<br>
<br>
SSC essentially made me decide to quit serious raiding in WoW. 20 hours of 25-man instance time per week barely gets us 6-hours of boss learning. Maybe we could be faster but I don't want raiding to feel like the kind of work it currently does. Seeing those 35-40 people we had online during raids just a few weeks back go below 25 is disheartening. I no longer want to be constantly in search of replacements - I want to be able to raid on a schedule where attrition isn't that great and where we can still see new interesting bosses. To me it no longer really matters that they finally choose to fix this - too many people are gone for good and I fear more yet will be gone before this goes live. I don't even want to think about summer attrition. I'm sure there are others in a similar situation, but then again there's not much new to that. Same thing was going on with AQ and NN also. I guess same thing will keep on going and new people will take the place of the old.<br>

Group stacking has a huge impact on caster dps and it has a big impact on rogue dps. You can't just stack a caster group for max dps and then expect rogues to hang with them. Likewise you can't stack a melee group and then expect casters to keep up. Barring very high armor/mobility/cleave fights.</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->Group stacking has a decent impact on caster DPS. But, without stacking groups, rogue DPS is extremely lacking. At bare minimum, a rogue must have a warrior in his group to do more than beat a tank. On the other hand, most caster buffs do not require groups (shadowpriests are broken currently, but I dont think blizzard will ever admit it). For a rogue to have maximum dps, he needs a feral druid, fury warrior, TSA hunter, enhancement shaman in his group. This means if you have 2 rogues in the same group, their dps is not as high as it could be. Basically, my point is that you are wrong in assuming caster dps is more affected by group stacking than rogue dps.</div>

<br>
Weapon skill is heavily marginalized since 2.0 but it does have some use.  Certainly you would consider spending the item points in other ways at times if you had the choice but it undeniably does do something still, just not for glancing blows.  In contrast spell penetration has never shown that it ever had any effect other than in pvp parses against people wearing a specific school resist.  We've been told that it does something but it's never been demonstrated (and in fact attempts to do so show the opposite).  I would love to be proven wrong on this one!<br>
<br>
Vontre was not arguing but merely clarifying the point by noting that even when vulnerability was a possibility, parsing showed that there were innate level-based resists on mobs that were completely unmitigated by spell penetration.<br>
<br>
There, I'm done putting words into other people's mouths.  That's what I gleaned from the byplay though and it fits well with my memory of events.

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->If we're going to nitpick: it's quite possible that I'm wrong, but I believe the exact circumstances were that spell penetration never had any effect with a warlock applying CoE/CoS. The instances where mobs even had spell resistance to begin with are rare, but the reason that SP was universally maligned was none ever had more than 75 resistance to something so the curses made it completely obsolete. I do seem to recall that there were mobs it was potentially useful on but since there was nearly always a warlock present in 40 man raids it was never really a useful stat in practice, and any mobs with that high of a resistance would be severely limit the damage a caster could do with that school in the absence of a warlock.<br>
That's is about how useful weapon skill is right now unless you're the tank, and even then it's next to worthless. The primary difference between level-based resists and glancing blows is that presently you simply cannot get rid of glancing blows where level based resists can be at least partially overcome by stacking +hit.</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->Shaman and shadow priest in my group make a huge huge difference as far as groups go. Heck elemental shaman even moreso. All I said was that caster and melee are dependent on group stacking. (not really one more than the other)<br>
<br>
Also comparing rogue dps with tailoring caster dps is not really applicable for balancing classes around. I don't think rogues understand this. All they see is omg casters, too much damage!<br>
<br>
I mean from the earlier post saying that they had trouble keeping up with a warlock+sp in their raids. I go to their armory page and pull up their best warlock.<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111110132149/http://armory.worldofwarcraft.com/#character-sheet.xml?r=Cenarion+Circle&amp;n=Kerena" target="_blank">http://armory.worldofwarcraft.com/#c...ircle&amp;n=Kerena</a><br>
<br>
No way anyone is going to keep up with someone geared in that much tailoring gear. That's above tier 5 gear dps and might be as good as tier 6. Rogues just don't have anything like it. Does this have anything to do with rogues being broken... no not really.</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->Unavoidable resist is 6% dps loss for casters approximately.  Glancing is definitely bigger for melee (and absent entirely from hunters).  <br>
<br>
The principle I'd like to see is that overall, the combination of all these effects per level dps drop should be about the same for all damage dealing types.  Caster (DD, DoT, Binary, or not), Ranged, and Melee (yellow and white, dual weild and not) <i>should</i> be very similar.  Dual weilding melee may be similar to casters in the %hit department, but is vastly different than other melee and hunters.  Glancing is not equal to unavoidable resists, and the resists are not consistent across binary/non-binary spells or DD versus DoTs.  Ranged dps has no equivalent to glancing or unavoidable resist.</div>

You could increase the DPS on all melee weapons or you could decrease the glancing rate - both will increase the DPS of the melee classes, so does it really matter which you do?<br>
<br>
It seems like Blizzard has decided that melee DPS (which should have a small advantage due to their increased vulnerability to short range PBAoEs and the like) isn't quite where they want it to be and so they'll change something. If the end result makes mages (or hunters or warlocks or whatever) undesirable in raids then they'll change something else (and yes, it will probably take them months to make that change, as people have pointed out they're not exactly prompt about these things). I agree that spell penetration is a silly stat, but it seems like there's a large argument here that's basically just over detail in the larger picture.<br>
<br>
As to the rest, thank you Blizzard for finally saying something. I do really hope they do something to mana potions (5 minute cooldown would be wonderful) but any movement on consumables is good news. And trash, and itemization, etc. Of course we'll have to see how it pans out, and I'm sure at least some of our hopes will be disappointed, but it's a start.<br>

(Good news that they're actually going to test BT on the PTRs too. Hopefully we get less Vashjs because of it.)</div>

Not quite.   Mobs have 8 resist to all (including holy) per level above you when you are level 60.  This works out to 2% dps loss per level above you.  I haven't seen the data for level 70 to know if it is still 8 resist per level or if that has scaled to remain effective 2% damage loss per level above.<br>
<br>
This has NOTHING to do with curse of shadow/elements.  Those spells, and spell penetration gear, do not remove these innate level difference based resists and take a MoB to 0 resist.   That resist is just there no matter what.<br>
<br>
Whether there is a warlock around in your group or not, spell penetration is useless.</div>

Lets take the extreme.  Glancing blows cut your dps on level 73 bosses by 50%.  Ok, doulble the weapon damage and class skills to compensate.  Good idea?<br>

OK, now some trash mobs (level 70, 71) or PvP.  Suddenly the first group has DOUBLE the dps of the Hunters on these targets.<br>

Glancing and other level based damage reduction has to be even across classes and damge types or else there will be significant imbalance somewhere.    Make them equal dps for same level targets, and the one with worse reduction has issues on bosses.  Make them equal on bosses, and those with poor scaling have an advantage in pvp and against trash and low level targets.</div>

		<div id="post_message_316925" class="post_message_underline">Issues with caster DPS, and physical DPS counterparts:<br>
<br>
- Consumables: Mana potions are significantly more powerful to a caster than equal cooldowns for physical DPS. Consumable changes could nerf caster DPS significantly, for better (cost) or worse (DPS positioning).<br>
<br>
- Synergy: Debuffs are far more powerful when consumed by casters. Shadowpriests past two or stacking Warlocks (or even Mages) deteriorates quickly because of debuff slots and personal buffs not stacking for the raid (Re: Invulnerabilities, Misery, etc). Physical DPS could use more debuff synergy, not just personal contribution.<br>
<br>
- Tailoring / gear / itemization: Simply put; I will maybe see side-grades in Hyjal / BT. As it stands, I could live without the 1-2 situational upgrades I will see from SSC / TK. As already voiced numerous times, cloth crafting supersedes other crafts by leaps and bounds, and what can we expect when physical DPS breaks ground with raid drops (assuming T5-zone drops are revamped properly)? Shadowpriests / Mages are glass cannons to be competitive with the top of meters. Physical DPS / Warlocks are sitting pretty at 60-80% increased STA.<br>
<br>
- Shadowpriests (in particular): We have approached Fury Warrior Status. While we can't necessarily perform two raid rolls, we bring so much to a raid through other means. Our DPS  begets more mana and begets more DPS. Like 1.0 rage for fury, DPS increases exponentially (not necessarily just personal DPS).<br>
<br>
I'm threat capped anyway, so I don't see much progression as a player. Hopefully this doesn't detour from my will to play. 130% ranged threat is very much not real (from numerous experiences). MT TPS can ultimately deteriorate with upgrades, so I can only expect to be capped sooner.<br>
<br>
=====<br>
<br>
Personally, I find Shadowpriests and Warlocks being much more wanting to prove themselves. They've never had their fame and are throwing down at all cost to show their worth. And depending on consumable changes, it could be more than enough to put a significant dent in this effort.<br>
<br>
Currently, top DPSers are frontloaded from consumables, gear, and capped on progression. Physical DPS has tons of room to grow, and I only see these patch notes as a bandaid. The bandaid will only need to be replaced as the tables turn.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Overtuning end bosses I can live with but overtuning trash is just ridiculous. Taking months to fix it is almost unforgivable. When faced with TBC endgame in a guild with 20 hours of 25-man raiding per week I've been forced to conclude that raiding is no longer fun. It's the same old except with more farming, more trash and less bosses. I think there are a few great encounters in TBC such as Aran and Nightbane. A lot of Karazhan encounters are entertaining and newly tuned Magtheridon is very nice also.<br>
<br>
SSC essentially made me decide to quit serious raiding in WoW. 20 hours of 25-man instance time per week barely gets us 6-hours of boss learning. Maybe we could be faster but I don't want raiding to feel like the kind of work it currently does. Seeing those 35-40 people we had online during raids just a few weeks back go below 25 is disheartening. I no longer want to be constantly in search of replacements - I want to be able to raid on a schedule where attrition isn't that great and where we can still see new interesting bosses. To me it no longer really matters that they finally choose to fix this - too many people are gone for good and I fear more yet will be gone before this goes live. I don't even want to think about summer attrition. I'm sure there are others in a similar situation, but then again there's not much new to that. Same thing was going on with AQ and NN also. I guess same thing will keep on going and new people will take the place of the old.<br>
<br>
Yet one can only think: if only, if only...</div>

They need to make raiding more fun/more worthwhile AND make the entire game accessible to more people.  What I mean by the latter?  Remove or significantly reduce the cost to respec.  Its ridiculous that I have to spend 100G to be semi-competitive on an Arena team and then go back to being able to tank for a 25 raids.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">If the gear from Hyjal isn't needed, I can see most people skipping right to Black Temple. Most will be avoiding the lengthty farming process to get 25+ people of the right raid composition ready to go into Hyjal. However, the additional stam on the warrior chest piece is probably a clue to what is needed as we move on as the other stats had slight changes....and since there will be a consumable change, gear upgrades may be more valuable than they are now. <br>
<br>
Since Tier 6 is reported to be in Hyjal/BT, I'm not sure what linear progression they have in mind anymore. It also makes me wonder about the amount of bosses in the two zones combined. The BT video tour I caught online didn't make the place look all that big with only a few defined areas that looked like Boss zones.....although it didn't have any of the underground part of it......but it looked like a zone that could be full of many trash pulls.<br>
<br>
Hopefully Tigole still reads this forum and sees the opinion the raiding community has about the Hyjal attunement....and hopefully the April Fool's day joke is a hint that they read all of our complaints.</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->The entrance portal for the Black Temple is a hole in the wall.  Although it's certainly possible that an attunement requirement will be added, it doesn't seem logical given the design of the instance.<br>
<br>
Upon zoning in through that crack in the wall, you emerge into a sort of sewer that's vaguely reminiscent of the opening of Metal Gear for MSX.  After making your way through that area, you emerge behind the giant wall that blocks passage to the temple proper from outside.  Up a large ramp is the door to the Black Temple.  Inside the temple are three distinct paths, each of which could plausibly be blocked off by a door.<br>
<br>
It's likely that the Black Temple won't require keying like SSC, TK, and Hyjal (that is, progression in previous instances is mandatory for moving on to the next).  Instead, it may simply have encounters that are balanced for raids with Tier 5 equivalent gear.  I'd rather like to see a new kind of keying or attunement that's confined to the Black Temple -- for instance, requiring the raid to accomplish some objective in the first sewer area before they're able to move into the temple itself.</div>

Make it a 5-10 min cooldown - something you'd use in an emergency or maybe once per fight, not chain-chugged as a matter of course. Unfortunately this may require retuning a bunch of encounters.

You could also wait til you go OOM to use them, rather than using them preemptively, i.e. "Okay, I'm not at risk of going oom but I'm going to drink this anyway because IF we don't wipe  in the first X minutes (which we have been) I'll go oom &amp; need a potion here and still have it on cooldown there."<br>

I definately think it would be much cooler if the attunement process for Black Temple was "self-contained" in the temple itself and allowed you to enter but  in the same way as Naxx;  you can enter, but you will only be able to get so far until you acquire better gear.  It just seems that Blizzard is very intent on keeping everyone in each instance for a period of time (or at least visit each at least once).  I would like to think Hyjal has some reward/draw/purpose outside of lore alone.   <br>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->... sounds like an pre-emptive apology for an upcoming nerf to me. Of course, if you look at alchemy as a primary money maker, then removing stacking capability or making them exclusive (take a flask OR an elixir) will make you lose money because you will be selling less. If they make elixir persist on death, same applies. And of course, removing them entirely from the raidgame (doubtful, but also a possibility) would do the same.<br>
<br>
I am rather sure that it wasn't an oversight that potions were left out. I don't expect any big change to potions, for it really would mess tremendously, esp. with regards to healing and mana potions as well as stone/ironshields. On the other hand, "nerfing" elixir and / or flasks would possibly upset the semi-balanced masteries of alchemy.<br>

Removing the tedium of farming sounds good in any case. I'm alchemist to fill my own need, not to make loads of cash, though dropping herbalism in favor of tailoring made it quite costly, too.<br>
<br>
<br>
As for another point that came up in this thread. Tailoring or melee vs. caster. I believe it's hard to find people saying it isn't a good or very good profession for cloth wearers. With current itemization, tailor made items are basically the best you can get. And you can get it without setting foot in one single raid instance, even. Comparisons with T4 and T5 itemsets are aplenty too and speak in favor of tailoring.<br>
<br>
Yet, when I compare with blacksmithing, it occurs to me that tailoring, albeit extremly or even overpowered at the moment, will not be scaling as well. Blacksmithing has an entire tier of items more, which need those elusive nether vortexes. Tailoring has no such tier. Will melee bypass caster itemization again as the game progresses later ? Is there another tier coming to tailoring (and other professions) coming as well in the expected upgrade to professions ?</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->Worth remembering that depending on your server economy you might find flask of titans to cost around same as 15-25 super mana potions. Depending on group composition and gear you can very realistically expect your healers (and shadow priest) to go through this much in a single karazhan run during the learning phase. With optimal specs and decent gear you most certainly don't need to pot up for Karazhan but if you aren't running quite the optimal group composition then you very soon run into a situation where you are "forced" to make up for the slack with consumables. In 25-man raids this seems to be to an extent a permanent situation: only the very best raid groups can defeat most (not all mind you) bosses without significant consumables. Everyone else has to resort to serious farming.</div>

So will they simply upgrade the horrible feral gear to a proper Ilvl? or will they genuinely make a feral T4, T5 and T6 set that a feral wants (i.e. bear/cat stats primarily! if we want to heal we can buy a healing token and mix/match gear =).<br>
<br>
I really want to see a proper Feral set. They could easily do this and it would make a LOT (all?) ferals very very happy. Give us some upgrades!</div>

Personally, I find Shadowpriests and Warlocks being much more wanting to prove themselves. They've never had their fame and are throwing down at all cost to show their worth. And depending on consumable changes, it could be more than enough to put a significant dent in this effort.<br>
<br>
Currently, top DPSers are frontloaded from consumables, gear, and capped on progression. Physical DPS has tons of room to grow, and I only see these patch notes as a bandaid. The bandaid will only need to be replaced as the tables turn.</div>

Currently Shadow priests blast roguesd out of the water for DPs. They also heal and restore mana and can even shift and be a spot healer. They can buff (although in a raid I doubt they would) but overall who has more utility? Rogue? or Shadow Priest? Now who does more DPS? The shadow priest wins a lot of fights, the rogue wins some others.<br>
<br>
Rogues bring nothing at ALL but DPS!  Let them be kings of their trade for crying out loud. This is NOT a nerf! this is a buff! It means your raid dps will increase. You will be just as useful as you ever were.<br>
<br>
And please do not lose sight of the fact that if it turns out rogues are kings after they upgrade to T6 and who needs anything else for DPS now, well, they will just get nerfed back. At least give these changes a chance before you just say it will mean every other class is pointless.</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->Nothing fills me with more horror than this idea. In my experience of MMORPGs, the consumers often have too much of a vested interest to be given a say. Class balance by popular consent? /cringe.<br>
<br>
Whilst some issues - trash, buggy boss scripts, ridiculous consummable usage, and so on - affect everyone and equally, and need addressing, I still have far more faith in Blizzard to address them (eventually) and find some sort of (vaguely acceptable) solution than I do in the massed voice of gamers producing something similar.<br>
<br>
Maybe a "focus group", in which Blizzard approach random representatives of random guilds now and then, would work, but my experience as one and of 'average' players is that they don't care about the fine details of class balance except when it directly impinges upon the class(es) they play themselves. Likewise, I'm sure if it went up to a vote amongst WoW subscribers, you'd see more people voting to fix the "Vengeful Harbinger" quest in Terokkar Forest than to fix Serpentshrine Cavern.</div>

I always chuckle at posts like "WHAT R THEY DOING ALL DIS TIME ARRRGHHRAWR" because it shows a complete lack of understanding on how code gets written and changed.<br>
<br>
For instance, when I worked for a major mobile handset company we'd get requests to change UI icons for different carriers.  Now you would think thats a pretty uninvolved process but swapping even something so small (several KB at most) required a software rebuild and on occasion led to random UI bugs that netted in an average turnaround time of 1 week.  Thats not including the Process bureaucracy of a source controlled codebase.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">This has been talked about in here. Casters have around 8 resist/extra level that they can't mitigate. Essentially I think it was ~8% dps loss for casters due to that (not very sure about the number) but it is resist all that CoS/CoE/Penetration can't remove, on any and all bosses.</div>

</div>
<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->My point is that rogues have a similar loss to glancing blows that casters have. What casters do not have is a dps loss in the form of armor. After making my post, someone sent me a screenshot of The Lurker Below showing his base armor at 7685. This means that after sunder, there is a ~32.5% damage reduction. After Faerie Fire, a 29.8% damage reduction, then finally with the underused CoR, we have 3675 armor for a 25.82% damage reduction. In lvl 60 raids, we only saw this type of armor in bwl when rogue threat management made up for this loss. In Naxx, a guild that used sunder/cor/ff would see a physical damage mitigation of 10% or less.<br>
<br>
Clearly, a 5% loss in dps from glancing blows is not the reason physical dps suddenly lowered from its previous lvl 60 state.</div>

We all know how much more help it would be to have  4-5 non mana based DPS monsters on these new encounters. The one thing that I fear though is that if they (rogues / warriors )get the pve buff that is needed to put them on top of damage meters then the damage output of a raid is going to get nerfed by blizzard in some fashion.

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->Heh. And that's the story of a relatively mature software development process.<br>
<br>
Important thing to remember about MMORPG engineering: the demands of a multi-million user client-server environment with code updates expected on a monthly or bi-monthly schedule are fairly different than the demands of a fire and forget console/PC game. Even when you look at something like Diablo II, which has online play and patches, you're still facing a very different set of problems.<br>
<br>
Further, game software engineering isn't really that mature as a field. This isn't surprising; most game companies don't pay software developers as much as other software development jobs would. Same goes for, say, project management. Same goes for management in general. If you're in gaming, it's because you love the field. A lot of good people /do/ decide to take that pay cut, but so do a lot of people with no experience as engineers/PMs/whatever.<br>
<br>
So you take a fairly immature software development process -- most game companies still think crunch time is an appropriate and normal way to handle scheduling -- and you ask it to handle the demands of MMORPG development, and you get a fair amount of chaos. I'm sometimes surprised that MMORPGs fly at all.</div>

By the time that software is ever released it'll be obsolete. In fact, I tried out the alpha download of the calendar app and can't see how its any different from google calendar or Outlook. It's funny because you can read the book with some software development knowledge and it's like watching a train wreck as it happens, you can just see every mistake forming from people that should know better.<br>

I definately think it would be much cooler if the attunement process for Black Temple was "self-contained" in the temple itself and allowed you to enter but  in the same way as Naxx;  you can enter, but you will only be able to get so far until you acquire better gear.  It just seems that Blizzard is very intent on keeping everyone in each instance for a period of time (or at least visit each at least once).  I would like to think Hyjal has some reward/draw/purpose outside of lore alone.   <br>

Also, I'm not all that optomistic on the consumable change nor the glancing change. We were told that with the change to weapon skill that it would still remain one of the best stats in the game. As we all know that is very far from the truth. I'll take a wait and see attitude and hit the PTR up to see if we can affect any change to their decisions if they are lackluster.....and hopefully, unlike beta, they will listen to us about it this time around. And while they are at it, maybe they will look at armor mitigation on bosses as well. I am this jaded about thier promises because of their track record and nothing else.</div>

When the armor to migtigation formulae were changed, most of the armor values in the game were updated, I would assume this includes mobs, however the armor reducing debuffs were not changed. That is, during the mechanics changes many of the mobs probably saw their armor changed from (say) 4000 to 7000, giving them the same base mitigation, however the armor reducing debuffs were not scaled to fit.</div>

We all know how much more help it would be to have  4-5 non mana based DPS monsters on these new encounters. The one thing that I fear though is that if they (rogues / warriors )get the pve buff that is needed to put them on top of damage meters then the damage output of a raid is going to get nerfed by blizzard in some fashion. Otherwise we will start to see 4-5 min Gruul kills, 5 min Hydross kills and so on as a common thing.</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->Its been on PTR for a week or so, its some very minor and futile fixes, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111110131942/http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/patchnotes/test-realm-patchnotes.html" target="_blank">clicky</a>.<br>
<br>
The buff to melee DPS will not be huge no matter what they do to glancing, it wont make your Rogues jump from 7th to 2nd atleast.<br>
<br>
The armor thing is annoying but easily fixed, allow expose armor to work with sunder too... adds some raid benefit from rogues which has been wanted for awhile. They could even fix Imp FF so it reduces 50/100/150% more armor aswell which would help.<br>
Ofcourse by doing this you open up a bag of worms which will increase physical DPS significantly:<br>
Expose: 2050, improved 3075<br>
FF: 610 *150% = 1525<br>
Using the Lurker Below these enhancements (non imp Expose) would put him nicely down to under 1000 armor or so.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I know that Tigole has commented on their database issues in the past, I can't imagine how many millions of database queries are going on per second on their servers.

</div>
<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->Eh? The game does not store all actions player do in a db. That would have broken the whole system as soon as about 40 people gather together.<br>
<br>
Hek, even the place where your player stands is only checkpointed once every 5 minutes or so to the db backend.<br>
<br>
Besides, there is a huge difference between a query (more or less complex search in a large dataset and returning parts thereof) and logging (throwing data on a heap to be processed later). You know, during the old traditional maintenance downtime, they didn't actually reboot the realms (unless needed for patch deployment), they basically only do heavy database optimization and reindexing (which would create huge lag spikes and prolong the process would they allow people to be online during that time, a problem they seem to have technically solved with the need of maintenance downtime minimized now. DB partitioning finally? Don't know). Realms weren't down during maintenance day, they were merely kicking players off and not allowing any in, as long as the process was running. No big magic behind the curtain. Someone told me once they were also defragging the realm server's harddisc during that time. Very possible and sensible if the logs get first stored on the realm server and only transferred to the db backend during maintenance.<br>
<br>
AFAIK Player actions themselves for example in a boss encounter are merely propagated along and only stored very short time in memory buffers. In essence, a world or instance server is not much more than a big message dispatcher who occasionally sends data to or receives data from the backend.<br>
<br>
Boss encounters and events are scripted in lua so they run a lua interpreter themselves. This also enables them to hotfix it without restarts, btw.<br>
<br>
I can give you no hard references of any of this, so keep that in mind.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">being very simple, isnt glancing blows on a lvl 3+ mob = 40% of attacks with 30% mitigation?  So 12% of white dmg is lost.  Multiply 12% by whatever the rogues % of damage is white dmg, and you have your dps increase.  So, probably 5 to 7% dps inc.  I agree with the others who say that the increase in dps due to increased Time on Target will be a bigger deal.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>
<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->That was the basic formula when weapon skill could adjust glancing mitigation percentages. Now, you glance 40% of the time, for 24% loss due to glancing mitigation, which is 9.6%. My WHite dmg is 50-55% of my total dps, so you could expect a 4-5% dmg output increase if Glancing was removed, which it wont be, it will be reduced, so less than a 4-5% dmg increase.<br>
<br>
To be honest, I would expect to see rogues the nerf targets before too long if our dmg goes up too much. There are still some fights rogues shine in, and I have been in a few. Warlocks are busy busy on magtheridon, but our first 1% wipe had me leading overall dmg by 140k, and our kill clock me with 580k dmg, the next closest person at 480k dmg. Ive sustained 1000+ dps on several fights when flasked. When rogue gear ~ tailoring gear, the dmg is likely to be way way out of scale with other classes if we truly are getting a dps bump. <br>
Excluding one hunter who is our raid leader, the top of the dps charts on most fights, excluding melee rtarded fights like The Blind, tend have our rogues and tailor casters at the top of the list.</div>

Hmm.. I wouldn't be so sure.<br>
<br>
I played during the golden age for rogues (deathsting + wex + 4 part BS) pre 2.0 and the only people who could get close were top geared fury warriors, I was 100+dps ahead of the casters on a pure dps fight like patchwerk for example.<br>
<br>
After 2.0 hit (Glancing blows no longer mitigated by weapon skill) our DPS dropped dramatically and although there were other factors (casters getting much better value out of 41 point talents than rogues) we went from clear #1 to top 10 mediocrity.<br>
<br>
If the change takes rogues back to pre 2.0 with maxed weapon skill I wouldn't be surprised if rogues were fighting for the top of the damage meters once again.</div>

		<div id="post_message_317494" class="post_message_underline" style="min-height: 183px;">Not to stray away from the lively discussion of glancing blows but here is something I've been considering:<br>
<br>
When AQ40 and Naxxramas were released on the PTR the "high end" guilds had been long done with the current raid content. Thus, they had no problem logging on and testing that content since a lot of guilds saw it as a way to progress for free (I remember repair bills being more of an issue pre-TBC gold inflation). Now that even the top of the top guilds have raid bosses to work on how willing will they be to schedule days out of their raid schedule to test content?<br>
<br>
I know that, personally, I'm not that interested in beta testing content on the PTR when there is a lot of other stuff I could be doing even when not raiding. Though I suppose that if come 2.10 we have buggy content then I shouldn't really complain that they didn't give us a chance to test it. On the other hand, Blizzard proved that they could have a polished encounter even without PTR testing i.e. Kel'Thuzad.<br>
<br>
How many people here would actually schedule a guild raid on the PTR?</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->Glancing rates vary by boss (probably based on their actual defense rating).  Glancing on Gruul is at 50% rather than 40% for another ~1.2% loss in melee DPS.

<br>
The change would have a very similar impact on warriors who have between 40-60% of their damage from white attacks.

Overall an at most 4-6% buff to rogue DPS will have minimal impact on DPS standing compared to contributions from increased survivability, group compositions, gearing options and consumable usage.

Anyhow, complaining about how this will turn out is really getting deep into rampant speculation now.  Until it gets on the PTR and we can see exactly what changes are making place, I'm going with the base assumption that melee damage will be increasing with greater survivability, and that can only be a good thing.<br>
<br>
I'd like to re-iterate one other point that others have made, both in this thread, and in others.  Most casters are using tailored sets that are itemized far better than T5.  Think about that for a minute.  Most of you don't even have full T4 yet, and we have sets better than T5.   It's largely an equipment issue.</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->Best case scenario, you have a rogue doing 1000 dps for a sustained period of time (as a point of referece, our best kara-geared rogues do at most 800 dps).  6% of that is still only 60 dps.  In a "normal" raid that's 120-180 dps.  <br>
<br>
I really wouldn't consider that a signifcant change when you consider several raids are doing upwards of 6-7k dps in the sustained dps thread.  I'm not saying I wouldn't take it, but it won't be cause for people to scream nerf 6 months from now.  Especially when you consider that most damage nerfs come due to pvp issues.<br>
<br>
It does make a pretty strong case that combat is going to be the undisputed king for rogue dps again.  Mutilate's big advantage was that it was mostly yellow damage and not subject to glancing blows.<br>
<br>
Edit: I'd also add that weapons *are* itemized correctly, and that's where melee gets most of their dps - especially rogues.  Tailoring vs tiered armor doesn't matter nearly as much for a physical dps class.  The tiered gear is nice, but the poor itemization of it isn't holding a rogue back.  In fact, several of the set bonuses are really, really good.</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->I'll take your word for it then, bird, as you guys (FH) have had a lot more experience at the extreme end-game than I have.  Just wondering that since Hyjal is technically "in the game" as far as we know, and there aren't any token turn-in spots for teir6.  Will it be added later, after BT is released? (or maybe they're inside either instance).  If thats the case, I'd guess the vial limit is a way to ensure teir6 will be added before any guild can mathematically get into Hyjal prior to Blizzard actually putting teir 6 into the game (2.1). /tinfoil hat off<br>

If warriors and druids aren't glancing as much either then they should gain only a little less than the rest of us melee right?

</div>
<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->As a tank, I find roughly 30% of my threat generation comes from white damage (as stated in several other threads on these boards), or at least that's what KTM tells me. Less glancing would, as a result, generate more threat, since my white dps is going up, as well as feeding me more rage during those avoidance streaks where I'm starved for rage to the point of having a problem keeping my important debuffs (TC/Demo/Sunder) up, while maintaining full-time shield block.<br>
Unfortunately, I find that the rage generation from hits is pretty terrible in any case, meaning that regardless of me gaining 10-15 white dps or not, my rage generation won't increase to the point where I'd be able to use alot more threat generating abilities during rage starved periods.<br>
From my experience as a fury warrior in the past however, -glancing penalty (formerly achieved through +weapon skill), upped my dps far more than it helped with tanking (yes, I've tried tanking with edgemaster's before. lol.)<br>
I have a feeling a change in glancing is either going to become horribly unbalanced in the start and they'll patch it up over time, or they are going to have to change a LOT of class mechanics / threat formulae, meaning it'll be quite some time until this'll actually go live.</div>

All rogue combo builiders and finishers are yellow damage and have never been subject to glancing blows. Rogues get about 60% of their DPS from white damage, which is why glancing is a huge deal.<br>
<br>
The best way to currently amplify rogue DPS is via group buffs and group stacking which quickly leads to have/have-not rogues (and usually officers calling out the rogue without iLotP, WF, imp BS for 'sucking'). There are few direct debuffs that improve rogue dps aside from Sunder whereas almost all caster DPS is enhanced via debuffs for the whole raid to enjoy. This is at least partially the reason casters excel in a raid setting atm (how many raids roll with enough Enh. Shams, Fury Wars, MM Hunts and Ferals to buff multiple rogues?)<br>
<br>
Having Expose Armor do ANYTHING would be nice (lower defense maybe?). A debuff/buff that isn't 31 - 41 points into someone else's talent trees in order to improve rogue dps would be nice.</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->No, Im pretty sure thats an incorrect ratio, its comparing the number of glances to the numbert of hits+crits, not the number of glances to the number of swings. I am a bit rusty on my math, but if I use Tolac as an example, reconstruct the total number of swings, then take 40% of that, I net 62ish glanges, and he had 63.<br>
<br>
THe way I understand the formula is, on any given melee swing there is a<br>
<br>
40% glance chance.<br>
Your crit chance.<br>
Your hit chance.<br>
Your Miss chance.<br>
<br>
The 40% is taken off the top, swing 100 times, you will glance on average 40 of them. <br>
If you have 45% Crit and 25% hit, you will only crit 35% of the time, as you run out of possilbe outcomes, when you add 40+45+25, its over 100%. One of the issues with the glance cap in the past was you couldnt get your crit/hit past a certain point, as glancing was a 40% off the top moidification you couldnt get past.</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->Yes, from a ratio of glancing blows to swings perspective WWS does not provide the correct results and the glancing rate is fixed at 40%.  But from the perspective of actual damage delivered, which is what we're measuring with DPS meters, 50% of landed hits are glancing blows with the current available gear (more +hit would push the WWS numbers closer to 40%).  Thus the best case scenario of glancing blows being completely removed is that rogues gain ~6% DPS.  (50-60% white damage composition * 24% penalty * 50% effective incidence).  This is what we'll actually see on the DPS meters, or a smaller increase if glancing blows are set to some new mitigation value between 0 and 24%.</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->This kind of comment probably belongs in another thread, however, I will adress it here since it was posted here.  Normal news outlets like NYT simply do not have any interest in our demographic.  Nor are gamers as a rule prone to obsessing over political scandals or world events that are the baliwick of the media.  Its a mutual "Don't give a f*ck" relationship.<br>
<br>
Gaming media, which by definition caters to our demographic, exists in a symbiotic relationship with developers and publishers.  Developers need the gaming media to care about and write about thier software, and major gaming media need access to screenshots, alpha builds and interviewees to be relevant.  Imagine PCGamer, IGN, or thier ilk flamed your software up one wall and down the other, called for change and better communication, and published editorials calling for your resignation.  Whether or not the media is correct, and you were aware of these issues and were working to fix them (I'll go out on a limb for Blizz and stipulate that they are) would you send them exclusive screenshots of your newest expansion to splash on their cover and generate sales?<br>

		<div id="post_message_317690" class="post_message_underline">I read Tigoles post yesterday and I am happy for all us melee goers.  The main problem is "potential" dps imo.  Everyone can line up stats and theorycraft how much dps one class can do versus another, with certaqin buffs, pots etc....  But what isn't taken into account is that while melee right now may be theoritically equal to casters its not the real thing due to mechanics in the fights themselves.  PBAoEs, cleaves movement are extreme hinderance to melee dps where a caster can stand back and pew pew with relative safety .  And even when taking aggro mechanics into question most casters have caught up to rogues, but not quite hunters in aggro reduction abilities making them even better in terms of 'safe' dps.<br>
<br>
<br>
Think of it in these terms. So far for every shade of aran encounter (melee dominated) there are 5 encounters that are caster dominated.  Couple of example such as Gruul (even post nerf still), nightbane, etc...  Switch this around and im sure casters would be celebrating any hint of a possible buff to not make encounters so not one sided<br>
<br>
One thing I think should be looked into however is rogue utility and as it has been said a thousand times over.......allow expose to stack with sunder and i think we can finally see balance take shape.<br>

I think you misunderstood my metaphor. I wasn't trying to say that people buy games out of a loyalty to the publisher. Rather, I was saying that just like in politics, a computer game company would not want to lose out on the publicity offered by a magazine/website with a large reader base, even if that magazine/website had spoken of them unfavorably in the past.<br>
<br>
I see your argument going two ways--<br>
<br>
1) People learn about new games from gaming magazines/websites. If that is so, then if a major gaming magazine/website were to castigate Blizzard for one of their failings, would Blizzard really want to lose the publicity it would gain by giving them preview screenshots of their next game?<br>
<br>
2) People don't learn about new games from gaming magazines/websites. In that case, publishing a report unfavorable to a company wouldn't really make any difference at all, even if the magazine/website didn't get any exclusives from that company, since clearly people aren't affected by those that much. :V</div>

<br>
Personally I've always thought the whole 'melee problem' was a bit overblown.  Most of the (perceived) problems rogues have in the current raiding game have more to do with stupid encounter design than they do with actual class abilities and mechanics.  My personal experience, which may or may not be abnormal, is that rogues are very competitive in terms of damage on any non-lame fights(gruul).  We have one rogue in guild who is combat daggers who consistently tops damage meters on most fights(by a wide margin).  Either he is really good and everyone else is atrociously bad, or rogues really aren't all that bad.</div>

We have a shadow priest that matches my TPS on many fights, with full mitigation (minus TA totem...) when fully buffed.  Granted, I could spec into much higher aggro, and use more shield block for better slams.  But I'd have to sacrifice mitigation to do so, or lower raid dps by having someone else take imp demo/imp tc to get 1hws and imp sunder, etc; which will be at best unreliable anyway.  Its all bursty, sometimes I can beat him by 20%, and sometimes he catches up to me in no time at all, even over long periods.  No one else really gives me trouble though.<br>

Although, being a raid leader, I sometimes lose focus on a perfect rotation too to go over on-the-fly changes, and my aggro will dip some for it.  Still, you can definitely catch a tank as a shadow priest.</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->I've shared similar outlooks. Even on fights were melee cry foul (Gruul, Prince, Nightbane). Gruul being the least because Ground Slam and OT threat being far more detrimental to melee range -- Cave In aside. We have a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111108080635/http://armory.worldofwarcraft.com/#character-talents.xml?r=Kil%27jaeden&amp;n=Raldez" target="_blank">combat swords</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111108080635/http://armory.worldofwarcraft.com/#character-talents.xml?r=Kil%27jaeden&amp;n=Balanar" target="_blank">mutilate</a> rogues that have been competitive on single target encounters. They also shine very well on encounters with close add DPS (Hydross, Lurker, and Magtheridon) due to how spell damage is ramped up and constant.<br>
<br>
We've seen this all over these boards in the DPS threads. Rogues and hunters alike are hitting the top of charts, and they are certainly not sitting in tiers of gear on par with casters. As always, it is coming down to the player behind the class. Not that all classes are as "easy" to attain top merits, but I will definitely argue the potential isn't really lopsided.<br>
<br>
I can only imagine how physical damage buffs and two tiers of gear (like our casters) will push them far above the pack. Not that mind numbing, kick, stuns, expose armor (bear tanks?), etc are useless utility.<br>
<br>
And this is without talking about how consumable changes will impact casters far more, where we can expect a 15%+ DPS increase from potions. Not to mention mana pots playing a significant roll in maximizing DPS. Frankly, I am expecting to pay MORE to maximize DPS consumable use, with the new system, which is ass-fucking-backwards (totally different issue).</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">But isn't that just rogue utility for fellow rogues?  I mean if you bring 3 mages instead of rogues, there is no reason to worry about the armor of the boss at all.  <br>
<br>
Personally I've always thought the whole 'melee problem' was a bit overblown.  Most of the (perceived) problems rogues have in the current raiding game have more to do with stupid encounter design than they do with actual class abilities and mechanics.  My personal experience, which may or may not be abnormal, is that rogues are very competitive in terms of damage on any non-lame fights(gruul).  We have one rogue in guild who is combat daggers who consistently tops damage meters on most fights(by a wide margin).  Either he is really good and everyone else is atrociously bad, or rogues really aren't all that bad.</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->It was in contrast that armor has scaled up in TBC but -armor debuffs havent scaled as fast with it.  Thusly melee is deleeing with more armor then pre BC on a % scale which also cuts their damage.  As some have pointed out on speculation on the cut to glancing blows it wont raise damage by that much.<br>
<br>
Solution?  Kill 2 birds with 1 stone.  Rogues need utility, melee will still need a bit more damage to outweigh taking stacked raids full of casters.  It seems like a simple enough solution.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I've shared similar outlooks. Even on fights were melee cry foul (Gruul, Prince, Nightbane). Gruul being the least because Ground Slam and OT threat being far more detrimental to melee range -- Cave In aside. We have a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111108080635/http://armory.worldofwarcraft.com/#character-talents.xml?r=Kil%27jaeden&amp;n=Raldez" target="_blank">combat swords</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111108080635/http://armory.worldofwarcraft.com/#character-talents.xml?r=Kil%27jaeden&amp;n=Balanar" target="_blank">mutilate</a> rogues that have been competitive on single target encounters. They also shine very well on encounters with close add DPS (Hydross, Lurker, and Magtheridon) due to how spell damage is ramped up and constant.<br>
<br>
We've seen this all over these boards in the DPS threads. Rogues and hunters alike are hitting the top of charts, and they are certainly not sitting in tiers of gear on par with casters. As always, it is coming down to the player behind the class. Not that all classes are as "easy" to attain top merits, but I will definitely argue the potential isn't really lopsided.<br>
<br>
I can only imagine how physical damage buffs and two tiers of gear (like our casters) will push them far above the pack. Not that mind numbing, kick, stuns, expose armor (bear tanks?), etc are useless utility.<br>
<br>
And this is without talking about how consumable changes will impact casters far more, where we can expect a 15%+ DPS increase from potions. Not to mention mana pots playing a significant roll in maximizing DPS. Frankly, I am expecting to pay MORE to maximize DPS consumable use, with the new system, which is ass-fucking-backwards (totally different issue).</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->This topic came up a lot when, briefly during the rogue review, expose armor was stacking with sunder.  The problem lies in the rogue combat system:  Using our combo-points to keep up this debuff would lower our DPS by more than it provided, especially for low-cp generating builds.  The conclusion was that you would need an "EA bitch", someone with a high-cp generating build that dedicated themselves to keep this debuff up.  This is somewhat of an imposition on one person, but more importantly I do not think the benefit would outweigh the losses.  If anything it'd be close to a wash unless you had a stacked melee raid.<br>

If they were to make them stackable, they would need to change this dynamic somehow.  Maybe a poison that stacked it and just toss the old ability, that would be less impacting IMO.  They could adjust  the poison to have a damage component (although less than instant/deadly) to balance out for the debuff-bitch their damage output.<br>

Or, you know, they could fix armor mitigation.  It's through the roof.  With something like 1000 more attack power while buffed, a 20dps higher weapon and a new talent to increase my backstab damage by 10%, I still somehow hit about the same as I did at 60 in t3.

I'm sure it had something to do with leveling and such and why they didn't scale resists (getting partial resists on equal leveled mobs at a higher rate would kind of be retarded i would think).  <br>

But what is needed is not a direct buff to rogue damage but an indirect buff to rogue damage via utility.  In which melee as a whole also needs a damage buff so again......kill 2 birds with 1 stone.</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->I agree EA could be worked into usefulness, I just think some mechanics changes need to occur first before it's something a raid leader will consider a reasonable raid buff.  My baseline for comparison are other buff-other-dps utilities that various classes bring.  How many of them involve some sort of sacrifice?  None?<br>
<br>
An aura is probably easier, considering melee damage isn't very good unless they have dedicated melee groups in the first place.  I feel like the oddman out in a shaman/warrior/druid/hunter/rogue group, being the only one that doesn't improve their dps, while reaping all the benefit of their auras.<br>
<br>
But my point is, armor scaling up past its already set percentage was bullshit in the first place.  There's just no logical justification for it, period.  Why construct complicated solutions to this that involve adjusting specs/combat cycles to counteract a broken mechanic change?  For the record, every single rogue in my guild is combat daggers due to malchazeen being the best easily-obtainable weapon for rogues at this time.  And no, combat potency does not produce enough CP to "throw around", even with a 1.30 speed offhand with close to max +hit.  You would still lose relentless strikes procs trying to work that in with 5pt snd.  Mutilate spec might have an easier time of it, but we're back to the force-raid-spec deal.  We're talking one rogue providing the utility by giving something up, which doesn't exactly help the other rogues you may be bringing.<br>
<br>
Anyway, bah, this belongs in the rogue thread.  I'll shut up now.</div>

<br>
Shade of Aran last night both the warlocks were top DPS at the end of the fight. Affliction just seems to be an incredible spec now thanks to the debuff limit being pretty huge and the solid DPS while being able to "fire and forget".<br>
<br>
Rogues could use a buff, and to be quite honest, the crafted tailor set needs to be toned down for casters. Does no one think it is a bit silly that you can craft a set of gear you dont see yourself replacing until T5 or T6?<br>
<br>
Anyways... I am glad to see a glancing blow damage buff. It will really help out the melee and I think they need it. Lets be honest, if a shadow priest, mage and warlock are 10% in damage above the rogue and somehow this buff puts the rogue 10% above the mage/priest/lock... where is the problem? While ALL of the other classes bring other things to the raid, the rogue is purely a DPSer with little to no utility. Let them be a DPSer that is ALL they do!</div>

Look at druid tanking for example. Pretty big darn nerf. All the druids cried out in anguish "stating we get no upgrades!" That of course is entirely true (maybe this will change in this patch though =), but at the time warriors just saw themselves as not being as good as a druid tank, so they nerfed druids. By the time warriors gear up more they would have easily caught up and surpassed druids. But sadly as I said, its the now that counts.</div>

Seriously, do you think utility hasn't been brought up repeatedly?  The post I made, before I mainswitched, regarding beta/TBC rogue problems addressed it explicitly, repeatedly.  No response, and no evidence they ever plan to give rogues utility.<br>
<br>
Of course utility is preferable to "unquestioned DPS master", given how subject to change the latter is, but we've never been offered it.<br>
<br>
Threat control?  Went to hunters.<br>
Group crit and hit buffs?  Druids.<br>
<br>
About all that's left is a group haste buff... oh, wait, shamans got that.<br>
<br>
Whyever would rogues give up on asking for utility?<br>

		<div id="post_message_318088" class="post_message_underline" style="min-height: 183px;">I would love it if rogues were given a passive -threat aura, or a passive -ac debuff on hit (if each rogue put up a single sunder's worth of armor reduction passively while attacking, so that bringing multiple rogues got you more armor reduction, to a cap of say 5.<br>
<br>
This would add some rogue utility without cutting into their normal routine too heavily.<br>
<br>
The real amazing part of being a shadow priest or a scorch mage is that your damage buffs for the raid come passively from doing your natural actions.  Misery and weaving and vampiric touch all occur without interrupting your maximum damage output.  Scorch lowers you damage output slightly, but with the current math on mana limitations you're going to have to downrank at some point anyways.  Sunder from the main tank is natural.  Sunder from good fury warriors is also natural, as the avg fury warrior has to hold back a bit at the start and it turns out that sundering in serker is better for your threat curve vs a prot main tank (sooner devastate, better rage gen on both ends) than bloodthirsting or w/e.<br>
<br>
<br>
So I'd love to see something passive and useful for rogues - simply because it's ridiculous that they add nothing meaningful to your raid's performance beyond a pound of damage.<br>
<br>
Note that a -threat aura has no impact on pvp, and a passive -ac debuff has very little impact, as vs classes where armore is really important a rogue will expose.  The other suggestion of a -defense debuff is also interesting.  It's the little stuff that seems lacking from rogues in raiding.  As for the glancing change, expect it to help warriors far more than anyone else.  Rage loss to glancing is very very noticable.  Flurry uptime lost to lost rage lost to glancing is also noticable.  Reducing glancings will smooth out the fury engine even more.<br>
<br>
All of that said, getting back to tigole's post for a moment.  I think 2.1 is going to fix a lot of things.  I don't think anyone disagrees.  However, the one problem with "fixing a lot of things" is that the patch is looking like it will be massive.  Maybe it would be wise to push it live, as soon as it's verified that the imediate issues aren't borked.  Then instantly put up 2.1.1 on the ptr to continue testing of BT and anything else that crops up as needing more than a base polish.  Many changes could concievably go in and live if they don't break the game.  Overnerfing content or overbuffing players would probably be acceptable at this junction in the name of a speedy solution to the existing state of misery, especially if it was made clear that elements of the patch felt too important to wait on other elements.<br>
<br>
My goal for 2.1 would be to have everything that needs to be patched to the client tested well, with anything that can be hotfixed later (see black temple stuff) tested only in passing.  I'd be completely ok with a 2.1.1 or 2.1.2 hotfix being planned for just to get the most relevant portions of the 2.1 patch live.  (and I won't kid myself that the parts I want are the most relevant.  I'm sure there's people just as unhappy about other elements as I am about raiding snafu.)<br>
<br>
Oh and about the holy priest changes:  I don't think the changes will make "holy" priests into the best healers.  I think the changes will do a better job of making Discipline a PVP tree, Holy a PVE Healing tree, and Shadow a PVE Damage tree.  Possibly with noticable buffs to Holy and Discipline nuking for solo play (so bad sustainability, good burst in discipline etc)  I doubt the goal is for priests to be godly healers, I think the concern is that right now to be a good pve healing priest you basicly go disc/holy (some split as you like) which is one of the few "must be 2 trees" specs for any class remaining.  Blizz seems to want to give you the option to spec deep into any tree, and speccing your priest deep holy is just bad.  Meditation and imp fort are both too good to pass up for circle of awful.</div>

<br>
But to itirate what he said, its true. Rogues posted time and time again asking for more utility. I do not recall an actual official post every saying they would never ever be given utility, but I did see hundreds upon hundreds of requests for utility.<br>
<br>
Even if Rogues become the undisputed kings of DPS in some fights they will still lose out to locks, mages and hunters. Rogues have to be in melee range, some fights require to to be modile or die/wipe your raid. In these fights glancing blow damage matters not coz a rogue is not beating on th emob 100% of the time. So then what? you have a melee DPS who does less DPs and brings nothing else to the raid. Its still the same situation and just after this buff where rogues top meters on more fights will not change the fact that they will still be a hinderance on others.</div>

Even though I wear all the crafted gear myself, I must say it is rather overpowered. You're seeing your warlocks/shadowpriests outgearing your rogues by a significant amount, mostly because they're a tier or 2 ahead on gear despite everybody going to the same encounters. Personally, I would say something needs to be done about mage damage - they are behind the warlocks and shadow priests, even with all the crafted gear. Maybe remove the 10% coefficient nerf?</div>

		<div id="post_message_318133" class="post_message_underline">First off let me say, I think class balance at this point for PVE is pretty solid. In fact, considering the overall depth of play most classes are reasonably well balanced for pvp as well. Alterations in potions are so over due it makes me sick. I would LOVE to see half the bosses in game follow wodin’s suggestion (AOE dispel) or have a staging area which leads to the boss which purges all potions. <br>
The removal of the glancing blow mechanic is long overdue. In the past it put too strong a reliance on +weapon skill. The current implantation makes weapon skill pretty useless. (Check out the math. It adds pathetic damage to higher level mobs. In much the same way +defense is a pathetic way to raise your parry, dodge, shield block rating. No warrior with a clue picks up +defense for increasing those stats.) Considering the inability to defeat the glancing blow mechanic, a removal of this effect is long overdue was appropriate at the beginning of the expansion. This mechanic raped melee dps nearly as much as the AOE mass rape mob mechanics. As a dps warrior, my damage will go up considerably in the expansion with this change. ( Why? Glancing blows kill crits. A high crit rate is harder then ever to obtain in the expansion. The effective reduction in crit rate obliterates the usefulness of flurry for example. I feel rage starved hitting any mob that does not AOE. While, I am not silly enough to suggest I felt balanced at loathab, current mechanics are certainly far to punishing).<br>
	<br>
/rant on <br>
With regard to rogues, rogue damage is fine. I see many posters saying X does Y damage better then Z. For many classes, this is a function of play skill and gear. When someone posts “our mages obliterate our rogues” and we see a 600 dps parse from the rogues, then I think most of us think wow your rogues suck. Another prime example is warlock OMG from gruul. 30% of the fight of more is spent running around. Our mod kindly and correctly pointed out this fight strongly favors dot and forget hence warlock domination. Please consider the actual situation in which parses were collected before weighing them too heavily.  As several previous posters mentioned, group stacking is monumental in effecting individual dps. If you take two rogues of remotely similar gear and skill whichever one has a dps warrior and shaman will do 30% more damage. <br>
On most mobs, I see rogues pulling over 1000 dps with comparable gear. When glancing blows are removed their dps will be fine. Wodin perfectly pointed out the real reason rogues are problematic in many raids is the melee unfriendly nature of many encounters. Tigole admitted blizz sees this as a problem and changes are in the works to correct this melee unfriendly bias. (Goodbye mass cleave and sweeping strikes rape). <br>
Rogues have perfectly good utility in small groups. Sapp, stun, kick, silence, snare, casting slow etc are all very viable and useful. The primary problem is many high encounters have been designed which marginalize all that utility. It would be nice if the 41 talent ability in subt or assas added raid friendliness to these builds. I am sure combat dagger rogues would complain but the simple fact is there needs to be a trade off for increased raid friendliness. If rogues want more utility in general, then they need to be prepared for a DPS nerf. <br>
Most rogues are under the misguided believe that all classes are a jack of all trades at some level. This logic is heavily flawed. A shadowpriest has a different gear set and different talent build then a holy priest. Shadowpriests are fine as a backup healer but on the whole they suck as healers. A shadowpriest is NOT going to keep up a single tank in a heroic instance on most bosses. Obviously, 3 shadowpriests can not heal a tank at gruul and keep him up. Sure shadowpriests do sick damage. Sure they are fantastic mana batteries who as a direct result of doing damage can keep up a secondary damage group very well. Anyone who suggests that priests can do it all are confused. They can do it all if they change out all their gear and go for a talent respect. The same can be said of warriors. Warriors who dps or tank have totally different gear sets AND talent distributions. You are not going to have an arms/fury warrior tank gruul any time soon. The simple fact is dps warrior in tank gear has pathetic threat output. Sure a dps warrior can off tank but they are not particularly better as an offtank then a prot paladin or feral druid.<br>

<br>
You'll note that the majority of replies aren't advocating DPS; they're all trying to find ways to give us more utility because, frankly, nothing but DPS gets boring.  I've really enjoyed playing a mage because I get to do *more*; poly, keeping up scorch, kiting, stupid mage tricks, etc.  And mages are in many respects the most one-trick-DPS-pony class after rogues.  Even finding a way to add a *little* of that to the class as a general thing, a little non-DPS related role, would be huge.<br>

Like that.  Also, your post is full of misinformation.  No way in hell are rogues with comparable gear to your's pulling 1k DPS, unless it's on trash that is very short lived.<br>
<br>
Yes, glancing blows creates a somewhat low crit cap.  You're nowhere near it, and neither is any other warrior that I've seen on the armor.  You'd have to approach 40% crit unbuffed before glancing blows maybe entered the equation.  Hell, you don't even have flurry, so what are you worried about?<br>
<br>
Also, completely removing glancing blows, which they aren't, would only increase your rage production by 12%.  If you think you're rage starved now, last patch must have been agony.  <br>
<br>
There's more, but it seems your more angry than actually pointing out problems with current game mechanics.</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->I'll complain about it so long as their attempts at achieving it end up just unbalancing the game in favor of a select few classes. I personally don't see synergy as inherently good or bad; effective application of synergistic matching makes the game interesting, while improper application makes the game overly complex and gimmicky. I can have a game mechanic like: "Druid casts rejuvenation on the tank, priest absorbs rejuvenation effect to gain +50% healing on his next Renew, which gives the paladin a bonus of 20% overall healing effects on his Flash of Light for the remainder of the fight", and I've really added nothing to the game but micromanagement. <br>
<br>
Alternatively, suppose that mages get some kind of "Amplify Fire/Frost" effect; that's going to amplify Destruction warlock damage, so it's going to have to be carefully tuned. Then druids and shamans are going to need something to bring them up to par from a casting perspective, and physical classes are going to need something else to bring up their damage to competitive levels. And of course, since physical damage is generally more narrow than magic damage (i.e. one damage type excluding bleeds effects, as opposed to fire/frost/shadow/arcane/nature/holy), their buff is probably going to effect all of those classes equally, and if you're not careful it could end up being an easily-applied debuff that basically gives one class the ability to ravage everyone else in PvP. <br>
<br>
In other words, it's not as easy as you make it out to be.</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->Sounds like a drastic oversimplification to me. I see a lot of warlocks saying things like this; "oh, I have Spellstrike, so clearly when rogues get better main-hand weapons and other gear they'll be closer to my damage." Never mind that (a) most serious raiding rogues aren't using blue weapons at this point, (b) the weapon isn't as big of a deal as people make it out to be, (c) Tier 5 rogue gear isn't that great either, and (d) all the Tier 5 gear is getting a buff very soon, so maybe Spellstrike won't seem as great as everyone thinks it is by comparison. <br>
<br>
Having Spellstrike doesn't entitle warlocks to top damage meters any more than having a Crul entitled Fury warriors to top damage meters.</div>

		<div id="post_message_318200" class="post_message_underline" style="min-height: 183px;">Some varient of Expose Weakness (that does not have the same proc limitations) would have been perfect for rogues.  Honestly, I would prefer if it was a core skill and was not talent driven.   Consider something like the following:<br>
<br>
Expose Weakness<br>
Requires level 70<br>
<br>
All critical strikes by the rogue have a 25% chance of increasing the attack power of all attacks against the target by 30 and of decreasing the target's armor by 400 for 15 seconds.  This effect stacks up to 3 times.<br>
<br>
In practice, this would roughly equate to "having three rogues constantly attacking will give a 90+% chance for all the physical damage dealers to have a bonus 90 AP and an additional half a sunder-stack worth of armor reduction on the target.  A single rogue, by himself, would keep 1x of the stack up in the 45-60% range, depending on his crit rate, so it would have little effect in PvP balance.  However, there are diminishing returns when you have more than 3 rogues.</div>

		<div id="post_message_318205" class="post_message_underline">I'm very confused by a lot of the rogues who post here.  It has been my experience that right now rogues/warlocks are competing for "top" dps, approaching 1000 (or more) sustained dps on fights like Gruul.  Shadow Priests, Mages, Hunters tend to make up the tier directly below that.  I'm probably one of the better geared warlocks in my raid team and I sit comfortably at 900-1000 dps on most fights, and my friend's rogue is within a percentage point of me at all times.  That's before any nerf to glancing blows.<br>
<br>
Removing glancings is going to push him ahead of me I think.  Get better rogues?</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I just don't understand the rationale that any one dps class should be crushing meters all the time.

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->But they don't all provide the same utility.  Rogues, as far as heroics and 10 mans go, can provide stuns and the like, but we bring very little utility that other classes do and we end up requiring a lot more healing then ranged dps classes due to cleave (and other factors like Maiden).  It's not a lot of fun being the first one dead in heroics simply because of bouncing 360 degree cleaves.  <br>
<br>
Now I will admit, my typical karazhan group has an awesome mage and warlock to compete with me for dps, but on almost every fight, I end up top or very close to the top (I believe on our last curator fight in which we will poured on the dps, our mage with 1400 spell damage ended up only 2000 damage ahead of me with a grand total of 220k).  So since I am a fairly well geared rogue who actually "tries", I'm able to keep up in terms of dps with arguably one of the best mages around with CHEATER (joking) 1400 spell damage from tailoring!  It's a running joke in my guild though in regard to how useless rogues are.  I end up dead on some fights, especially heroics, from stupid cleave mechanics, and a few people always make the comment that they should have brought a ranged dps as it would have made it a lot easier.  I don't particularly like to hear these comments, but they are right...rogues shouldn't be a liability in groups, and for what we bring to raids, we should have the potential to beat all other dps classes by a solid amount.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">As for now the question is how do you compose the optimal melee DPS group.  It makes the most sense to bring 5 melee DPS because of the way in group buffs work.  This means enhancement shaman, feral druid and dps warrior get the first 3 slots and rogues go into the remaining 2.  Bringing more of the same buffer types doesn't provide any additional synergies and with enough buffs threat becomes a potential issue for both warriors and enh. shamans.  Bringing more than 2 rogues crowds out buffs that affect the whole group.  I'm still struggling with this issue because my guild has more rogues than buffing classes.</div>

</div>
<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->This is why my guild (pretty recently formed), runs with a max of 2 rogues (only 3 member spots for rogues in the guild), 1 enhancement shaman, 1 feral druid and 1 DPS warrior.  The synergies we get off each other are pretty sick, but outside that group you are kind of screwed, and there isn't room for a second full melee group in a 25 man raid.  With this type of group, the correct gears and buffs rogues can not only top damage meters, but can do so by a fair margin. <br>

So it's not an issue with warlocks and shadow priests, it's an issue with having Naxx gear at the same time everyone else is running around in some MC gear.<br>
<br>
I will also say that I agree, rogues need to be at the top of the DPS meters, since they can offer absolutely no syngeries in a raiding environment.  However, lets please not turn this into yet another rogue crying thread, there's plenty of those elsewhere.</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->I explicitly left the hunters out of the melee buff group because I'm not sure the tradeoffs are worth the synergies.  TSA is a bonus of 125 AP for a group that when fully buffed is in the 2500-3000 AP range, which at most comes to a 3% DPS buff for the other 4 members.  The hunter has to then stay at minimum range to benefit from all the melee buffs, which may or may not be practical depending on the fight (e.g. impractical on Gruul).  And finally the hunter's own DPS would suffer from mana depletion since they would not be grouped with a shadow priest or maybe a resto shaman.  So I would still keep to 2 rogues and 3 buffers over the 1 rogue and 4 buffers grouping.  If you're bringing only 1 hunter and 1 rogue to a raid then putting them in the same group makes sense but if there are more than they would be better off in separate groups.</div>

The first 2 warlocks are generally stuck using utility curses, but the 3rd and 4th can use CoA/CoD/(CoR if they fight allows for it), increasing their DPS by 15-20%.

Even without JoW the speed at which it is consumed by wanding, blasts, and SW-D is pretty signifigant.  Meaning that ISB is rarely a signifigant factor in long-term raid DPS, and is more suited to 5-mans, until we get more diverse wand itemization (see links, I'll bet you even money your wand is one of them).</div>

And yeah, given the current melee realities it's about all you can do to get 3 Rogues buffed up with synergy abilities.  I will, however, grab an underperforming and undergeared Shadow Priest for raids because no matter how badly they half-ass it, Misery and 5 stacks of Shadow Vuln. will be up the entire fight.<br>
<br>
When Rogues can park themselves behind a mob and tear into it for an extended period of time, their damage is just fine.  Most welcome (if I can try and re-rail this thread) of Tigole's posts is the consumable stuff.  They've re-tuned Gruul and Magtheridon to the point where serious DPS consumables aren't needed to meet the encounter's bare minimum.  Some work on the Alchemy angle would be nice for SSC and The Eye.  And I don't want to hear a bunch of Gnome Warlocks chorusing ALCHEMY IS FINE...because it's not.<br>

Next, I want to hump the leg of whomever said all classes should be able to farm/acquire materials at roughly equivalent rates.  This is something I've been saying ever since BWL (when I started using consumables aside from the odd mana/fire pot).  Blizzard seems pretty attached to the idea that healing classes' lives should be miserable and I don't think they'll let go of it any time soon.  I love playing my class to heal in raids and groups.  But the large majority of the game is designed with the solo-er in mind, and as a full Resto spec I just can't farm stuff.  I can put on my cast-off melee gear and a 2h, and auto-attack mobs till they die.  This seriously limits my ability to enjoy the game when I'm NOT in a group.<br>
<br>
Finally, there are huge and noticeable differences in damage output between players based on skill/knowledge/experience.  I specced full Elemental (in decent but unimpressive gear) last night and trashed every single Mage in my guild on every fight in Kharazan and Gruul's Lair, just to slap them in the face and convince them to pick their performance up (it's bad).  I should not be out-damaging Mages in far superior gear by 80k on Gruul.</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->First off, any shadow priest worth his salt should *usually* not be casting MB/SWD when ISB is up.  It's far far far better to just flay during that time to preserve the buff, since dots do not consume any charges.  The exception is if you're noticing the ISB charges hardly being consumed at all.   <br>
<br>
Secondly my experiences is it stays up quite a bit longer.  I can watch the debuff tick down at a steady pace, it is hardly gone before the next shadowbolt hits the mob.<br>
<br>
Thirdly, I can't remember the last time I saw casters sitting around wanding for JoW.  It may happen very infrequently, but the majority of the fight there isn't any wanding going on.</div>

<br>
With a couple of affliction locks, a few smart shadow priests, and one good geared destro lock it can stay up quite a bit; as the only person really consuming it will be the destro lock - who should be looking at a 25%+ crit rating.<br>

I suggest all shadow casters get dfilter so you know when it's up and can make better spell choices.</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->Similarly, you don't bring a Shaman for enhancement DW dips so that he can top the damage meters, you bring one because of the incredible benefit he provides to his DPS group.<br>
<br>
The current situation is that a rogue, given available gearing, has a severely limited time-on-target, cannot top the damage meters or provide any benefit to the raid or party beyond LOLKICK, and you're often short on raid dps, and the boss or his adds (or his adds' adds) have a PBAoE that you have to heal through.<br>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->Ideally, you could consume 3 charges of ISB with the hardest hitting nukes available in the raid, which would typically be shadowbolt.  However, ideally the last charge would remain up the entire duration, because during that time it is amplifying the DoTs from 3 warlocks+ and the DoTs + flay of the shadow priest.  And again, ideally, a very hard nuke would consume the final charge right as it would expire.  This would be the most damage you can milk from the buff.  I don't give a hoot which warlock gets credit for the "big bolts" amp'd by the proc, but I would like it to last the full duration.  It should be easy to see that the dots of 3+ affliction warlocks and a shadow priest being amp'd by 20% is worth more than a few mindblasts.<br>
<br>
So when you see ISB up and if DoTs are about to fall off, it's an excellent time to refresh them.  I do not believe Mind Flay consumes charges, so it's <b>very</b> excellent time to hit up any clicky trinkets you may have and go to town.  The mana will pour out of you!  Typically on fights where I may have taken some damage and need healing (Magtheridon comes to mind after a cube, blast wave pulse, 30% transition, or conflag, or Gruul after a shatter, cave in tick, whatever) seeing the ISB proc up makes a seriously excellent time to Drain Life.  I've had it tick for over 800.</div>

<br>
With a couple of affliction locks, a few smart shadow priests, and one good geared destro lock it can stay up quite a bit; as the only person really consuming it will be the destro lock - who should be looking at a 25%+ crit rating.<br>
<br>
I suggest all shadow casters get dfilter so you know when it's up and can make better spell choices.</div>

</div>
<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->I disagree with your assumption that affliction locks do not use ISB charges.  Affliction locks should be casting SB, its more damage than Drain life under all but the most extreme circumstances/gear (like wearing 3/8 tier 1).  Affliction locks, while they usually grab ISB on the way to bane, generally shun +crit in favor of +hit.<br>
<br>
My assertion was that "More Warlocks Means More ISB up-time" was not a given fact.  I can consume all 4 charges in 12 seconds with the next 4 shadowbolts, one of which has to crit to keep the chain up all the time, and still maintain a good DoT cycle.  If there were two of me, we would both be consuming 4 charges assuming flat "every 4th bolt crits" (not actually even remotely likely).  If there were 3 of me... you see my point?  Note that this 100% effeciency, just for the warlocks that are actually proccing the debuff is only possible with ISB (I'll stipulate that I haven't seen a raiding warlock without ISB since TBC release), 25%+ crit and a fantasy world where that means exactly every 4th bolt crits.<br>
<br>
This is confounded by sPriests that are more accustomed to relying on DoTimer than tracking debuffs, and the fact that there's usually at least one healer or mage who's wanding themselves into the 5-second rule on a boss.  The "almost every TBC wand = shadow" may be a personal gripe of mine that I wanted to vent, but it is an actual issue affecting the viability of ISB.<br>
<br>
Because the third (and fourth, fifth, etc) warlock isn't casting CoE or CoS (10% +damage to all shadow priests and mages is hugely more aggregate damage than 1 CoA), does not summon any more HS's than 2 warlocks are capable of, and more warlocks does not mean more ISB, you still really only need 2.  The 25-man raid size simply means that the problem is less noticable (2/40 &lt; 2/25), or perhaps, not really a problem at all.</div>

My feeling is that daggers have their place for Mutilate/Combat Daggers, and the fact that the Gladiator's Shiv is the best OH even when spec'ed for the others seems a little off.

The issue seems to stem from one single, *enourmous* oversight by Blizzard.  sPriests and warlocks, (and to a lesser extent mages), have easy access to a cookie-cutter gear set they can aquire in exactly 0 raid cycles (minus the neck).  6 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110810103936/http://www.thottbot.com/?s=frozen+shadow" target="_blank">epics</a> of extremely <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110810103936/http://www.thottbot.com/i24256" target="_blank">high</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110810103936/http://www.thottbot.com/?s=spellstrike" target="_blank">quality</a>, with very good set bonuses (see the moslty laughable T4 bonuses), plus <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110810103936/http://www.thottbot.com/i24250" target="_blank">bracers of havok</a>.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110810103936/http://www.thottbot.com/i30666" target="_blank">A necklace</a> from Kara trash which is head, shoulders and waist above the equivalent gear for every other element, having almost twice the +Shd damage of any other neck's +spell damge.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110810103936/http://www.thottbot.com/i29272" target="_blank">A cheap +Shd badge</a>-reward off-hand that doesn't gimp your max HP,  An incredible passive haste trinket from the easiest heroic in TBC.  <br>
<br>
There is simly no equivalent gear for rogues.  They do not have 6 incredible set-bonus'd epics they can craft/have crafted before they set foot in The Black Morass, let alone any heroic or Kara.  There is no Quagmirran's Claw, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110810103936/http://www.thottbot.com/i28034" target="_blank">nearest thing</a> doesn't even come close.<br>
<br>
I'm optimistic that they are buffing rogues instead of nerfing locks/sPriests, as you said.  I would hope that the tailoring oversight will eventually be moot as rogues get geared in T5/equivalents while we are passing on sidegrades.  I would also hope that Blizz doesn't push rogues to the point that once they do experience this gear equalization, they are not the far-and-away highest DPS, as that would simply lead to more QQ, leading to re-nerfing of rogues to bring them down to warlock damage.  And we warlocks know very well what that means for us.  We learn that lesson every patch.</div>

Of course I can wield the gladiator's shiv despite my differing weapon spec and as frmorrison said it might even be the best choice, but that doesn't help it from being utterly stupid not to give other weapon specs than daggers the possibility to benefit from that spec with both hands.</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->I certainly understand this argument, but do realize that rogues are far less dependent on armor for damage increases than casters. The biggest increases come in the form of bigger, heavier weapons. If I go from a chestpiece with 90 AP to a chestpiece with 140 AP (which, for a rogue, would be a very sizable increase), I pick up ~5.7 DPS. If I go from a <a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28210" target="_blank">Bloodfist Destroyer</a> (71.7 DPS, 186.5 average damage) to a <a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28437" target="_blank">Drakefist Hammer</a> (81.1 DPS, 219 average damage), then I pick up a minimum of 20.5 DPS - very likely more with talents considered. Upgrading that to a Dragonmaw (88.1 DPS, 238 avg) would give me a minimum of ~34.2 DPS increase over the Bloodfist - from a single slot upgrade.<br>
<br>
Amazing crafted armor for rogues wouldn't do nearly as much for rogues as it would for casters. Would it be nice? Definitely, but it doesn't make-or-break us like it can casters. I just simply don't think that citing the lack of good leathercrafted gear as the reason that rogues are struggling right now is accurate.<br>
<br>
I would argue that the current blacksmithed weapons are the melee equivalent to Frozen Shadowweave.</div>

Drakefist Hammer... not very good, the 2nd teir still isn't great, and the simple reason is Mace Spec is worst possible weapon spec for a rogue.  I am still not sure why they changed Mace Spec for warriors where they get a chance to stun AND generate Rage... and we just get a chance to stun (the weapon skill should really just be part of weapon expertise).  If Mace spec gave you the chance to get energy, in such a way that it added a similar amount of DPS like Sword/Dagger/Fist Spec, then they would be the equivalent.  <br>
<br>
As it stands right now Vindicator's Brand is a better MH then even the second tier blacksmithing hammer, and Latro's is as good if not better then the second tier swordsmithing hammer... I am not seeing any blacksmithing items that I would deem equal to even Spiteblade and nothing even close to Talon of Aszhara.  If they change Mace Spec to be similar to what it is for warriors, then the crafted mace is getting similar to the Tailoring BoPs.  Dirge on the other hand is very similar to the Tailoring items, where it is very nice... just requires a Primal Nether.</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->Unfortunately, the three primary weapon types for rogues do not have appropriately statted/speed mainhand options, or (as in the case of fist weapons) the option does not exist at all. While the mace is certainly a viable weapon, it still suffers from having an inherent 5% dps loss associated with its combat spec.<br>
<br>
Additionally, the tailoring sets pick up extra performance from being single-school stats and thus being min-maxed on a level that tiered gear does not match. In order for the crafted weaponsmith items to be considered equal in my eyes, they would have to have superior speeds (2.8-2.9 for SS, 1.9-2.0 for daggers) and possibly even have a stat that we so far haven't seen in existence, like +AP while wielding daggers/swords/whatnot. So while they parallel the tailoring sets in terms of availability, I'm not entirely sure they rival them in power.<br>

I got that Dragonmaw/Gladiator's Shiv is like 1 DPS lower unbuffed with my current gear and spec... where I don't think a Aldor/Scryer reward and a drop from Black Morass are close to as good as Frozen Shadoweave.  I know it doesn't sound right... but 5% is 5% and 5% of 60% of your damage is a good amount.  Even not using Latro's and just using Gladiator's Shiv with both... Vindicator's comes out ahead.<br>

I am currently using Fool's Bane even though the numbers say Edge of the Cosmos does about the same... because the stun is nice sometime... picked up a Big Bad Wolf's Paw last night cause no one else wanted it and I haven't decided if the extra DPS is worth reenchanting it and respecing when I would prefer Spiteblade and am 2 weeks from a Gladiator's MH.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I certainly understand this argument, but do realize that rogues are far less dependent on armor for damage increases than casters. The biggest increases come in the form of bigger, heavier weapons. If I go from a chestpiece with 90 AP to a chestpiece with 140 AP (which, for a rogue, would be a very sizable increase), I pick up ~5.7 DPS. If I go from a <a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28210" target="_blank">Bloodfist Destroyer</a> (71.7 DPS, 186.5 average damage) to a <a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28437" target="_blank">Drakefist Hammer</a> (81.1 DPS, 219 average damage), then I pick up a minimum of 20.5 DPS - very likely more with talents considered. Upgrading that to a Dragonmaw (88.1 DPS, 238 avg) would give me a minimum of ~34.2 DPS increase over the Bloodfist - from a single slot upgrade.<br>
<br>
Amazing crafted armor for rogues wouldn't do nearly as much for rogues as it would for casters. Would it be nice? Definitely, but it doesn't make-or-break us like it can casters. I just simply don't think that citing the lack of good leathercrafted gear as the reason that rogues are struggling right now is accurate.<br>
<br>
I would argue that the current blacksmithed weapons are the melee equivalent to Frozen Shadowweave.</div>

Rogues are hugely weapon dependant, however the crafted BS weapons are not the equivalent having an entire set of epics (not just frozen shadow, but 6 double or triple-socketed peices, and an amazingly good pair of bracers) from bare-bones blues in a matter of 3-4 weeks, before you enter a heroic (The BoE sets require Nethers, BoP does not). Not to mention that the BoE tailor sets only require 3 nethers, while the weapons require many more.  And rogues have no passive equivalent to Quag's Eye as far as thottbot knows, an epic-quality blue item from a heroic that can barely claim to <i>be</i> heroic.  There's a gap there.  If Blizzard closes the output gap without allowing for the equipment gap, we're just going to have an imbalance in another direction.  They have a history of making these kinds of descisions.</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->Actually, the reason why he had his pet there is probably due to a bug. If your pet is in the doorway to Gruul's room when it closes then the pet gets stuck and will not move at all. You might be able to dismiss it or have it autodismiss by moving to the other side of the room, but dismiss has a decently lengthy cast time. I've had it happen to me the past couple of times and it is a pisser since pets are better used meleeing and dodging cave in.<br>
<br>
As for rogues and physical dps, one way they could have helped them indirectly is to make hunter survival tree not suck. Expose weakness is a pretty decent raidwide AP boost, but the tree is so subpar for raiding that it isn't worth getting. Perhaps they are doing that, what with the indeterminite hunter changes too.</div>

That's exact same suggestion I've made on official suggestion forums. That epic gems should've been patterns with lower drop rate and that they should've been combination of few rare cut + uncut gems + 1 primal.<br>

Here's an example:<br>
<br>
Random Name Epic Gem of 5Agi/7Stam<br>
2 Nightseye (Shifting Nightseye)<br>
3 Solid Star of Elune<br>
1 Primal of Life<br>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->If the upgrades were substantial enough, I'm sure people would go for them. I'll take my favorite useless gem as an example, lustrous star of elune. The uncommon version is 2mp5. The rare version is 3mp5 (which I think is a mistake, it should really be 4 or 5mp5, but that's a debate for a different thread). If the epic version was 7mp5 and needed 3 stars of elune and a primal might to xmute, people would be falling all over themselves to buy them. Or think about  a more useful gem, royal nightseye. Uncommon = 7 heal 1mp5, rare = 9 heal 2mp5, epic = 13 healing 4mp5.<br>

I guess the point I'm trying to make is that if they implement epic craftable gems, the upgrades shouldn't be as minor as the uncommon to rare upgrade was.</div>

		<div id="post_message_321785" class="post_message_underline">If you're JC you probably have Mining to go with it. I have tried Eng/JC on my hunter and that did not work at all, eventually it would've when my rogue hit 70 but I wanted to hit 375 JC as soon as possible. Besides I have epic flying mount on my hunter now, so mining is really easy.<br>
<br>
If they added epic gem patterns I would gladly mine whole day to get rares to make epics, under couple of conditions. <br>
<br>
First: they were not unique and second: they were not bop(talking about epic gems here). As it stands now, you can mine for about 1-2 hours in certain spots with epic flying mount and come out with 100-200 Adamantite ore that you can prospect for gems. Granted you will end up with a lot green gems but you should get a few rare gems too. <br>
<br>
Regardless of how much gems cost per server I would like to see non bop epic gems that you can craft, implemented.<br>
<br>
Also JC was supposed to be the profession to make fist weapons with. Right now there is only one pattern and necks/rings that are crafted are sub-par or resist gear strictly.<br>
<br>
<br>
PS. Maybe I was stingy on stats but if <b>Epic Gem of Shifting</b> were to become 8Agi/12Stam that would make it great upgrade regardless if mats I've suggested were 500G or 700G. Especially if you take into consideration piece of armor that you can enchant like shoulders.</div>

</div>
<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->This is where I am at a loss. When did we go from 'stage' encounters to 'beat the clock' encounters (TE i presume?)? What's wrong with Gruul, for instance, growing at every 5% of his health as opposed to every 30 seconds? One is a controlled fight that requires healers to be on their toes the last 20%, the other is a Flask Fest. Almost every fight i've seen super-cool enrage timers used on can be handled differently through the use of stages. Stage encounters are also far more forgiving on skill. On Aran in KZ, I found that taking our secondary and tertiary groups through that focusing on controlling when the stages occur, we were much more capable of handling the encounter rather than the primary group's 'burn em fast' approach. To me, it is a perfect fight (frustrating at times, but perfect). All of KZ falls into this category imo--the boss fights are perfect because the focus on your skill at handling the stages, not at beating some arbitrary timer mechanic.<br>
<br>
The numbers speak ill for the future of WoW raiding atm--i'm sure it is a combination of the consumables and the difficulty. Our server had 40 guilds kill Ragnaros which translates to somewhere between 1600 and 2000 people having experienced that fight and emerged victorious. 6 25-man raids have downed Gruul with maybe 2 - 3 more guilds even working on him (based on HKM kills). The current 'entry level content' is accessible to roughly 10% of the people who had access to previous entry level content. How is this going to create more content? How is this good for even the uber-guilds in the long term? We've had 3 raiding guilds disband and only 1 formed up from that. People are just giving up on raiding left and right. The Arena seems to be the most popular destination for end-gamers atm.<br>
<br>
When someone higher up at Blizzard sees those numbers, the raid game will become an afterthought. Blizzard will develop content for where the player base is gravitating because that's where the retention will come. The boggling thing is, we saw people moving TOWARD raiding pre-exp. I'm just not sure the devs understood what the average skill and dedication of those players was.</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->I think you need to remember that there was a time when killing Ragnaros was very, very difficult and most servers hadn't even taken him down.  Eventually it got to a stage that with the correct strats, and gear from a variety of other sources (PvP, ZG, Darkmoon, Battle Grounds) that Ragnaros became trivial, but that took 18 months from release before that happened.<br>
<br>
It's April 9th today, the TBC has only been out 3 months, give it a little while.  On my server for example, a lot of guilds have started Karazhan within the last month.  I have little doubt that by the time the end of the summer rolls around, you will see that Gruul will be Ragnaros 2.0.<br>
<br>
One other thing to consider is there was a stretch where Raiding was the only way to get decent PvP upgrades without dedicating yourself to 24/7 BG Farming.  In the current game, a lot of people who felt they were forced to raid, no longer need to do so.  With craftables, Arena Gear and Honor gear, if you are a PvPer, Karazhan and Gruul just aren't required anymore.</div>

It still means that if they want to push the boundaries, fights will end up balanced around flask + 2 elixirs + food + drink + weapon oil. And that in turn puts the boundaries way beyond what the average raider can stand for.  Or do they intend to tune it all down and let all encounters be trivialised by consumables?</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->As a fellow mage, this was my initial reaction too. If these are the only changes, I will still be spending my downtime grinding herbs and Chunks o' Basilisk ad nauseam. <br>

In a followup post, Nethaera says this is not the full extent of the changes. I agree with Gurg that Blizzard can't be so out of touch that they think this is a meaningful and complete fix. It doesn't even mention Flasks (do they count as your elixir, or are they in their own category?). What about the issue of chain-chugging health and mana potions? How do food buffs, oils, and other misc buffs like Flamecap factor in?<br>
<br>
My personal wish list is basically:<br>
<br>
1) Make elixirs persist through death<br>
2) Make raid bosses drop a cache of herbs<br>
<br>
It's good to see they're making changes, but it makes me anxious that after all this time, this is the best they have to show. Here's hoping they fill in the blanks soon.</div>

First, the alchemy changes are stupid. Sure, I save drinking 1 maybe 2 pots, but in the end I will still be drinking at least 2-stat enhancing and multiple health pots.. And i have it easy(being a rogue).<br>
<br>
I absolutely HATE the timed encounters instead of staged ones. I cant fathom why the designers thought it was a good idea to force raid-stacking. The fact that you know you cant beat an encounter unless the raid is average x-dps is stupid. They have gone backwards in raid designs since the MC days. <br>
<br>
Im interested in seeing the loot upgrades for epics - these probably being the last straw that will make me leave. <br>
<br>
LW is still grossly worthless when compared to the godly items made by tailoring. Honestly, who itemized tailoring and thought "yup those look good" and then proceeded to make karazhan loot far worse? t4 and t5 worse?. JC.</div>

				The numbers speak ill for the future of WoW raiding atm--i'm sure it is a combination of the consumables and the difficulty. Our server had 40 guilds kill Ragnaros which translates to somewhere between 1600 and 2000 people having experienced that fight and emerged victorious. 6 25-man raids have downed Gruul with maybe 2 - 3 more guilds even working on him (based on HKM kills). The current 'entry level content' is accessible to roughly 10% of the people who had access to previous entry level content. How is this going to create more content? How is this good for even the uber-guilds in the long term? We've had 3 raiding guilds disband and only 1 formed up from that. People are just giving up on raiding left and right. The Arena seems to be the most popular destination for end-gamers atm.

(reducing method, 1/1000 chance, one potion -&gt; 1/999, one more -&gt; 1/998 etc... untill you make a discovery)<br>

The goggles are interesting, 11 allows for exactly one type per class of armor (2 cloth, 3 leather, 3 mail, 3 plate) with the only exception being spell damage on plate.</div>

<br>
Concerning Alchemy:<br>
<br>
As far as I can tell, this change hurts some classes more than others.  Tanks will probably not be able to use Fortitude and Defense, or Agility and Mastery, at the same time.  As a hunter I use Mastery, Major Agility, and Onslaught/Fel Str all at the same time.  This change will force me to pick one.  IIRC healers only use Adept's and Healing Power, if they bothered to pot up at all.<br>
<br>
I'm not entirely certain what Blizzard thinks is the problem, because if this is the extent of their proposed "fix" then they appear to have completely missed the point.  Forcing people to use fewer consumables helps to artificially deflate demand, but it does nothing about the underlying problem - that in order to progress, raids were forced to use every consumable imaginable.  It's not like people want to spend their time farming for this stuff; they'd much rather be playing the game.  It's that they felt forced to do so because of the difficulty of, and lack of reward from, the encounters they were doing.</div>

		<div id="post_message_321888" class="post_message_underline" style="min-height: 183px;">On the surface these changes are very ho-hum. All this seems to do is pigeon hole certain classes to certain herbs for specific pots, does that really remove tedium? <br>
More competition for those select herbs, higher prices, making some elixirs obselete and undesirable, yep. <br>
<br>
Some people do like to pot up, some even like to herb, it's a fun part of the game. The tedium was in the fact you could pot to the teeth (which you spent a great deal of time farming for) and lose it within the next 10 seconds, the next 3 minutes, spending 20 mana pots in a few hours learning an encounter (which might or might not change), where your farming time was &gt;&gt;&gt; your raiding time to the point for some it was the bottleneck. <br>
Does anyone think this has been addressed within the outlined changes in this preview?</div>

		<div id="post_message_321898" class="post_message_underline">I'm overall worried about the outcome of the consumable change.  Every single encounter (that matters at all) will need to be retuned some, because currently they are balanced around having everything possible (fights that lack dps requirements probably do not need changed).  The best possible outcome for every class is going to be their best possible flask, and possibly 1 extra elixir.  The problem with this change is that some elixirs will become completely useless and never made / used again.  Why would a tank use a 550ac elixir over a flask, like ever.  Yea, you can use the ac elixir on fights that don't matter, but you aren't going to save a wipe because you have the ac elixir on.  Frost/Fire elixirs will never be used again, ever.  The requirement to making them is still retarded, but to top it off, Adept's offer a better stat gain than them and are all but free to make, and that's for situations you won't be using a flask.  Lots of dps classes will see what, a 30% reduction in stat/damage in a raid setting due to this.  A whole lot of nerf doesn't need to happen to content, but some rebalancing on the harder encounters would be nice.  Healers aren't affected by this change really; mageblood vs healing power vs flask.  Tanks and dps will see the biggest change, and of course, they were already using more consumables than anyone else anyways.<br>
<br>
There will be an inflation of certain consumables, and others will just become nonexistant, because their cost is already high and no one will need/want to use them anyways.<br>
<br>
Mage:<br>
Flask &gt; Adept &gt; Nothing<br>
<br>
Lock/Priest:<br>
Flask &gt; Shadow Power &gt; Nothing<br>
<br>
Warrior/Rogue/Hunter:<br>
Flask &gt; Fel Strength &gt; Onslaught / Agility (This is probably the only section that will see some use out of the lower end elixirs, they are cheap and still decent stat gains)<br>
<br>
Tank:<br>
Flask &gt; AC elixir &gt; Nothing<br>
<br>
Healers:<br>
Flask &gt; Mageblood &gt; Healing power &gt; Adept's &gt; Nothing<br>
<br>
<br>
TBC potion/elixir that will more than likely die and never be combined again:<br>
Elixir of Mastery<br>
Elixir of Major Frost Power<br>
Elixir of Major Fire Power<br>
<br>
TBC potion/elixir that are still awful and will still never be combined again:<br>
Fel Regeneration<br>
Elixir of Empowerment<br>
<br>
TBC potion/elixir that still cost too much to combine:<br>
X Major Resistance Potion<br>
<br>
TBC potion/elixir that are still missing:<br>
Caster dps flask that doesn't require old world materials (and the worst ones to get at that)<br>
<br>
<br>
I was looking forward to the changes, I really was.  Right now, though, I'm worried about the inevitable "super nerf" content is going to see because of the changes, the lack of any content retune at all, the consumable change that renders some potions and elixirs 100% useless forever and the lack of positive change to many tradeskills (many are still missing some very blatant things: IE: new dps caster flask [it's not the only thing missing, just an example]).</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->I think that's a pretty hard argument to make.  It doesn't matter if you're hardcore or not, spending every waking hour you play the game farming consumables does not make this game fun or involving, no matter who you are.  There's other aspects to this game that could possibly be enjoyable, but when your main focus is PVE, the majority of most guilds will only have time to farm their consumables and raid (if that much at all).  The problem at hand is this:<br>
<br>
*Some things are still missing<br>
*Some things still cost too much to make, rendering them useless<br>
*The content will more than likely not get retuned, making it harder than it currently is (which is kind of bad, because it's not easy in the least right now).  Hard content is great, but this supposed consumable change is supposed to make raiding "easier", and without some kind of retune, it will be harder for sure.<br>
*The use of mass consumables should be up to the player, imo.  If I want to spend 5 hours a day farming potions and elixirs, I should be able to use them, and get the most gain out of them.  That's the biggest problem I have with these changes.  You should be rewarded for your hard work and time investment, but instead you are just limited to being allowed to use 1 elixir type.<br>
<br>
How do you change the cost of the elixirs, but also allow the time investment for mass farming everything available?<br>
<br>
*Herb nodes yield more per pick, cost goes down, time investment to get herbs yourself goes down<br>
*Potion and elixir combines yield more than 1 per combine, lowering the cost per potion / material<br>
*Potions and elixirs last through death, lowering all cost by a great deal.  This lowers their wonderful idea of only flasks lasting through death, but seriously, who cares.<br>
<br>
Content should be tuned as if everyone had a flask on at the time, and nothing else.  This gives the incentive to get a flask made, but the necessity to having everything possible is not there.  Then people who wanted to come with all 5+ elixirs their class can use could still do this, and get a slight benefit from it.  Blizzard hates to face the fact that all elixirs SUCK compared to flasks.  The materials needed is a better investment for the buff.  The materials needed is a better investment for the time alloted for the buff (and lasting through death).  Honestly, why will I ever use anything but a flask?  Being forced to farm one single thing is much easier than 4-5 for me personally.  I can get into the habit and learn how to better farm that single thing.  But the 4-5 others are still useless to me, and I will never farm them or use them.  Blizzard needs to get a grasp of what reality is from a consumable standpoint.</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->I think the big reason why the T2 BoP Weapons make such a huge difference is that if anyone wanted theirs badly enough, they could get it prior to the start of the first Arena season.<br>
<br>
For example, here is the Gladiators Decapitor (2H Axe), verses the Mooncleaver (T2 BoP Axe everyone has)<br>
<br>
<b>Gladiator's Decapitator</b><br>
Two -Hand Axe <br>
330 - 496 Damage Speed 3.60 <br>
(114.7 damage per second)<br>
+48 Stamina<br>
Equip: Improves hit rating by 17.<br>
Equip: Improves critical strike rating by 32.<br>
Equip: Improves your resilience rating by 25.<br>
Equip: Increases attack power by 64. <br>
<br>
<b>Mooncleaver</b><br>
Two-Hand Axe <br>
339 - 509 Damage Speed 3.70 <br>
(114.6 damage per second)<br>
Equip: Improves critical strike rating by 48.<br>
Equip: Increases attack power by 98. <br>
<br>
Is there really that much of a difference?  No, but having the Mooncleaver day one of the Arena gave anyone who had it a huge advantage. It's not that the BoP weapons are far superior to the Gladiator Weapons, its just that you could have gotten yours 2 months earlier.<br>
<br>
So if the Hat is superior or on par with the best in the game (a big if of course), then it's no different than the BS BoP Weapons (or Chest piece).</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->I agree with this, there are too many things that people are hoping will get fixed and the likelihood everything turns out well is fairly low. The consumables thing is going to mean any boss with an enrage timer has to be retuned, they need to get away from encouraging class stacking for so many fights and without changes to encounters, it will only get worse. Trash needs to be retuned, but no one even knows how that will break down. For example, Gruul took an hp loss, but it was so small, its like he lost nothing. The bigger change was shatter. Trash in SSC, across the board, needs to lose at least 40% hp on every single mob because it just takes so damn long per pack and there is just so much trash from point a to point b, you take 5 steps and there is another pack of trash throughout the zone. I predict they might lose 5-10% at best.<br>
<br>
Its not a good situation when they have to rely on 1 specific patch to make everything magically ok, it just won't happen.</div>

</div>Why is this a "core issue"? Have you missed the bits where Rogues are easily the best DPS class outside Warlocks/Shadow Priests (in crafted gear they wont upgrade in a hurry)? Did you miss the bit where Tigole mentions glancing blows will be adjusted in the next patch, give them a little bit more damage?<br>
<br>
At the end of the day it doesn't matter if armor doesn't work like before. They can balance things in new ways and as long as they do it's not an issue at all.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">The Expose Armor debuff would be worth more raid damage than any other finisher you could do. I think it would surely be worth keeping up on the target if we could do it. Especially considering you could easily keep it up along with SnD, which is currently the best DPS finisher. <br>
The only build that might have trouble keeping both finishers up would be a Combat Daggers rogue. Mutilate, Hemo, and Fist-combat rogues have no trouble cycling 2+ finishers.</div>

</div>I agree EA could be worked into usefulness, I just think some mechanics changes need to occur first before it's something a raid leader will consider a reasonable raid buff.  My baseline for comparison are other buff-other-dps utilities that various classes bring.  How many of them involve some sort of sacrifice?  None?<br>
<br>
An aura is probably easier, considering melee damage isn't very good unless they have dedicated melee groups in the first place.  I feel like the oddman out in a shaman/warrior/druid/hunter/rogue group, being the only one that doesn't improve their dps, while reaping all the benefit of their auras.<br>
<br>
But my point is, armor scaling up past its already set percentage was bullshit in the first place.  There's just no logical justification for it, period.  Why construct complicated solutions to this that involve adjusting specs/combat cycles to counteract a broken mechanic change?  For the record, every single rogue in my guild is combat daggers due to malchazeen being the best easily-obtainable weapon for rogues at this time.  And no, combat potency does not produce enough CP to "throw around", even with a 1.30 speed offhand with close to max +hit.  You would still lose relentless strikes procs trying to work that in with 5pt snd.  Mutilate spec might have an easier time of it, but we're back to the force-raid-spec deal.  We're talking one rogue providing the utility by giving something up, which doesn't exactly help the other rogues you may be bringing.<br>
<br>
Anyway, bah, this belongs in the rogue thread.  I'll shut up now.</div>

<br>
Shade of Aran last night both the warlocks were top DPS at the end of the fight. Affliction just seems to be an incredible spec now thanks to the debuff limit being pretty huge and the solid DPS while being able to "fire and forget".<br>
<br>
Rogues could use a buff, and to be quite honest, the crafted tailor set needs to be toned down for casters. Does no one think it is a bit silly that you can craft a set of gear you dont see yourself replacing until T5 or T6?<br>
<br>
Anyways... I am glad to see a glancing blow damage buff. It will really help out the melee and I think they need it. Lets be honest, if a shadow priest, mage and warlock are 10% in damage above the rogue and somehow this buff puts the rogue 10% above the mage/priest/lock... where is the problem? While ALL of the other classes bring other things to the raid, the rogue is purely a DPSer with little to no utility. Let them be a DPSer that is ALL they do!</div>

There is ample room still though for statistical upgrades to the slots through additional int, stam and even spirit perhaps.<br>

I'm more than a little leery of the upcoming priest changes as well.  I hate to say it but while Holy/Disc <i>may</i> see some love, the shadowy mana-batteries might be in for further bludgeoning.  It's not like they don't deserve it but I'll still QQ like a baby.</div>

</div>Unfortunately it does not matter what will happen in the future. What matters is right now and classes will get nerfed or buffed accordingly. Look at druid tanking for example. Pretty big darn nerf. All the druids cried out in anguish "stating we get no upgrades!" That of course is entirely true (maybe this will change in this patch though =), but at the time warriors just saw themselves as not being as good as a druid tank, so they nerfed druids. By the time warriors gear up more they would have easily caught up and surpassed druids. But sadly as I said, its the now that counts.</div>

Have you missed the bits where Rogues are easily the best DPS class outside Warlocks/Shadow Priests (in crafted gear they wont upgrade in a hurry)? Did you miss the bit where Tigole mentions glancing blows will be adjusted in the next patch, give them a little bit more damage?<br>

</div>The 'Core Issue' is that a class that provides next to zero utility, no group or raid buffs &amp; debuffs of limited use, can only produce 'above average' dps on melee friendly fights and at times well below average on all the melee unfriendly fights.  With the addition of soulshatter/invis, rogues can no longer even make the claim to being superior on threat sensitive fights.<br>
<br>
At present, we have had a very wide range of classes that can top DPS meters on various fights.  Shadow Priests, Warlocks, Hunters, Fury Warriors, Rogues, Mages have all topped our DPS meters from time to time (which is great), however Rogues offer far less than other classes in terms of  buffs, group synergies, raid CC, debuffs, utility etc.</div>

</div>They do, but have been told they won't get it, so they fall back on DPS.<br>
<br>
Seriously, do you think utility hasn't been brought up repeatedly?  The post I made, before I mainswitched, regarding beta/TBC rogue problems addressed it explicitly, repeatedly.  No response, and no evidence they ever plan to give rogues utility.<br>
<br>
Of course utility is preferable to "unquestioned DPS master", given how subject to change the latter is, but we've never been offered it.<br>
<br>
Threat control?  Went to hunters.<br>
Group crit and hit buffs?  Druids.<br>
<br>
About all that's left is a group haste buff... oh, wait, shamans got that.<br>
<br>
Whyever would rogues give up on asking for utility?<br>

</div>Believe me, we've tried.  TBC was the perfect opportunity to add utility (real <b>raid</b> utility) to the Rogue class.  We got zilch, and in fact the Hunter implementation of Misdirection was one of the most common requests for Rogue utility.</div>

		<div id="post_message_318088" class="post_message_underline">I would love it if rogues were given a passive -threat aura, or a passive -ac debuff on hit (if each rogue put up a single sunder's worth of armor reduction passively while attacking, so that bringing multiple rogues got you more armor reduction, to a cap of say 5.<br>
<br>
This would add some rogue utility without cutting into their normal routine too heavily.<br>
<br>
The real amazing part of being a shadow priest or a scorch mage is that your damage buffs for the raid come passively from doing your natural actions.  Misery and weaving and vampiric touch all occur without interrupting your maximum damage output.  Scorch lowers you damage output slightly, but with the current math on mana limitations you're going to have to downrank at some point anyways.  Sunder from the main tank is natural.  Sunder from good fury warriors is also natural, as the avg fury warrior has to hold back a bit at the start and it turns out that sundering in serker is better for your threat curve vs a prot main tank (sooner devastate, better rage gen on both ends) than bloodthirsting or w/e.<br>
<br>
<br>
So I'd love to see something passive and useful for rogues - simply because it's ridiculous that they add nothing meaningful to your raid's performance beyond a pound of damage.<br>
<br>
Note that a -threat aura has no impact on pvp, and a passive -ac debuff has very little impact, as vs classes where armore is really important a rogue will expose.  The other suggestion of a -defense debuff is also interesting.  It's the little stuff that seems lacking from rogues in raiding.  As for the glancing change, expect it to help warriors far more than anyone else.  Rage loss to glancing is very very noticable.  Flurry uptime lost to lost rage lost to glancing is also noticable.  Reducing glancings will smooth out the fury engine even more.<br>
<br>
All of that said, getting back to tigole's post for a moment.  I think 2.1 is going to fix a lot of things.  I don't think anyone disagrees.  However, the one problem with "fixing a lot of things" is that the patch is looking like it will be massive.  Maybe it would be wise to push it live, as soon as it's verified that the imediate issues aren't borked.  Then instantly put up 2.1.1 on the ptr to continue testing of BT and anything else that crops up as needing more than a base polish.  Many changes could concievably go in and live if they don't break the game.  Overnerfing content or overbuffing players would probably be acceptable at this junction in the name of a speedy solution to the existing state of misery, especially if it was made clear that elements of the patch felt too important to wait on other elements.<br>
<br>
My goal for 2.1 would be to have everything that needs to be patched to the client tested well, with anything that can be hotfixed later (see black temple stuff) tested only in passing.  I'd be completely ok with a 2.1.1 or 2.1.2 hotfix being planned for just to get the most relevant portions of the 2.1 patch live.  (and I won't kid myself that the parts I want are the most relevant.  I'm sure there's people just as unhappy about other elements as I am about raiding snafu.)<br>
<br>
Oh and about the holy priest changes:  I don't think the changes will make "holy" priests into the best healers.  I think the changes will do a better job of making Discipline a PVP tree, Holy a PVE Healing tree, and Shadow a PVE Damage tree.  Possibly with noticable buffs to Holy and Discipline nuking for solo play (so bad sustainability, good burst in discipline etc)  I doubt the goal is for priests to be godly healers, I think the concern is that right now to be a good pve healing priest you basicly go disc/holy (some split as you like) which is one of the few "must be 2 trees" specs for any class remaining.  Blizz seems to want to give you the option to spec deep into any tree, and speccing your priest deep holy is just bad.  Meditation and imp fort are both too good to pass up for circle of awful.</div>

<br>
But to itirate what he said, its true. Rogues posted time and time again asking for more utility. I do not recall an actual official post every saying they would never ever be given utility, but I did see hundreds upon hundreds of requests for utility.<br>
<br>
Even if Rogues become the undisputed kings of DPS in some fights they will still lose out to locks, mages and hunters. Rogues have to be in melee range, some fights require to to be modile or die/wipe your raid. In these fights glancing blow damage matters not coz a rogue is not beating on th emob 100% of the time. So then what? you have a melee DPS who does less DPs and brings nothing else to the raid. Its still the same situation and just after this buff where rogues top meters on more fights will not change the fact that they will still be a hinderance on others.</div>

</div>I didn't realise that, all my experience from rogues comes from reading some threats here and there and what my guildies say, and none of them ever mentions the word utility it's always damage!. I should have known better than to trust them.<br>
Well, all I can say is that I believe that's a major flaw in the design then if (almoust) all the classes have hybrid roles except for rogues.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Woah there. Gruul and Nef are two completely different fights for a number of reasons. The biggest difference is that Nef wasn't on any type of timer. If you had 25 healers and 15 dps you could do it as long as you could outheal the damage and deal with the class calls. Gruul has a built in timer in the form of his growths, which is basically a countdown until he oneshots your tank. To say nothing of hateful strikes or shatter positioning. Phase changes aside, Nef was a glorified tank and spank. Gruul is a much, much harder raid boss.<br>
<br>
Another big difference is that farming all of BWL for 3-4 months meant your guild was geared up enough to beat Nef. Farming Maulgar (and Gruul himself) doesn't really give anything better than heroic or Karazhan drops. So before, where people could get gear upgrades to make the encounter easier, Gruul depends on consumables. And now they're nerfing our consumable usage.<br>

Real numbers on Earthen Ring -- we had, lesse, around 40 guilds who took Rags down and 20 or so who took Nef down. Right around the same numbers that Fujigato is working with. If he's right, no more than 200 people on ER should ever see a Gruul kill. "Ever."<br>
<br>
As of the most recent progression thread update, six guilds had killed Gruul. That's 150 people already. Two more competent guilds are on him and I'm sure they'll take him down pretty soon. So... the claim that for a population like ours, only 200 people will ever see him die? That's silly.</div>

When I was begrudgingly farming Azshara a week or so ago, I was thinking of an idea to make farming herbs suck less.  I came up with the sub-profession of Gardening.  You would get it with Herbalism just as you get Disenchanting with Enchanting (or Smelting with Mining).  When you pick an herb, you'd have a chance at getting a seed.  Depending on your Gardening skill and a base timer for a given seed, you could sustain your own herbs for a period of time.  Maybe add a few mats -- some potting soil and some pots -- you could throw those things in the bank and forget about it for a while.<br>
<br>
As long as Un'Goro isn't involved unless they made it the super soil which yielded twice the amount of herbs as normal.<br>

When I was begrudgingly farming Azshara a week or so ago, I was thinking of an idea to make farming herbs suck less.  I came up with the sub-profession of Gardening.  You would get it with Herbalism just as you get Disenchanting with Enchanting (or Smelting with Mining).  When you pick an herb, you'd have a chance at getting a seed.  Depending on your Gardening skill and a base timer for a given seed, you could sustain your own herbs for a period of time.  Maybe add a few mats -- some potting soil and some pots -- you could throw those things in the bank and forget about it for a while.<br>
<br>
As long as Un'Goro isn't involved unless they made it the super soil which yielded twice the amount of herbs as normal.<br>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->Isn't this just a roundabout way of admitting to having poor DPS players?  Nightbane is really one of the only fights where I feel that DPS is a complete non-issue, and even then that's not 100% accurate as tip-top dps can lock down the summoned skeletons faster and cleaner than a long, drawn-out brawl.  We had a recent Nightbane kill with 3(!) priests present and shackling the adds, and I really would have preferred just more DPS.<br>
<br>
I dont think it's unreasonable for Blizzard to plan 25-man encounters around the average DPS class contributing ~90% of their pve-specced dps.  We all know that some classes have an easier time living up to their potential than others- mage/warlock vs. hunter, for example.  Individual hunter attentiveness and "skill" can vary immensely from one player to another, and it has a staggering effect on their effective dps.  It's when I see these Gruul meters with mages and hunters doing 200k right next to druids and shadowpriests doing 300-350, that's just a bad player being carried by better players.<br>
<br>
I think Magtheridon is one of the better raid bosses designed by Blizzard.  I enjoyed learning and executing that fight, much moreso than pre-nerf Gruul.</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->Well admittedly you are required to have rounded out balance of relatively skillful individuals. When I say skillful I mean whatever it takes in skill level to kill Gruul, you need your dps to be as skilled as your healers to be as skilled as your tanks. Gone are the days of MC and some BWL where you need tanks (to a degree) and healers with a clue and a bunch of button mashing monkey dps. I don't think that's a bad a thing, having been a healer for a year, I say BMM (button mashing monkeys) can go to hell.<br>
<br>
Also have to agree on the enjoyability of Magtheridon. I'm just trying to be careful here because I know I have a really good guild which can make a difficult fight like that seem enjoyable and not too hard. We need to keep in mind his position in raid progression when assessing if his difficulty is appropriate.</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->He feels very C'thun-esque right now. If you get knocked near someone and can't get away before shatter it's pretty close to a eyebeam chain between two people. Probably won't kill you. However, if 3 or more get chained/shattered you still will die in C'thun and in current Gruul.<br>
<br>
Differences are that you can't control your distance from each other fully to avoid chaining entirely like you could in C'thun. However, that is balanced with a bit lower shatter damage than chaining damage and the fact that you can hurt multiple people for differing amounts.<br>
<br>
Good guilds make C'thun look easy just like good guilds make Gruul look easy. The similarities in personal responsibility are pretty close in the current Gruul implementation. A little less on the interrupt front but everyone still needs to pay attention.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Basically.  From the application info I posted above:<br>
<br>
<br>
That's not really a bad thing.  I mean, think back to MC through AQ40, and large parts of Naxx.  If you had a terrible tank, you were going to wipe.  If your healers sucked, you were going to wipe.  If your DPS sucked, you had longer clears.<br>

TBC has just spread responsibility more evenly.</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->I agree, that it is not a bad thing.  Maybe it is b/c of my class, but I love the DPS tests in the raid game.  That is why I am not sure of the reason that a lot of people have been speaking about hating Hydross so much.  I mean sure he is difficult and his loot is pretty meh (but I do like my ring) but it is pretty exhilerating to me to be able to get him down before the doomsday enrage.  People like to say rogues are 2-button monkeys (and lets be honest most are) but some rogues (like Kalman and Pf and others) that really focused on the precise cycles to squeeze out your optimal dps show otherwise, and it is in encounters like Hydross that you want guys like that on your team.</div>

		<div id="post_message_323294" class="post_message_underline">Natural - I am sure it depends on the server.  My server never managed to do anything other than guild only Ony kills.  The top guilds laughed at teh idea of anyone there PuG'ing her.  We never reached a point were we could reliably kill her with less than 30.  So a PuG on Gruul not likely to ever happen here.<br>
<br>
Not to mention we were hosting MC runs for people to get gear if that gives you an idea of our server.  Where other servers were selling spots in BWL and AQ40, we were doing it with MC.</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->I entirely agree with coolness factor. However, I think there is a large disconnect between guilds that did all of AQ40 and especially C'thun which showed people how to move around and those who haven't and are just becoming comfortable with those concepts.</div>
