Engineering apparently has something to do with Alchemy now, my guess is that these two items create the Super Healing/Mana pots. The injectors are listed as requiring the Black Anvil. Good to see that at level 70 we'll still be running BRD.<br>

And I agree with Gurg, Alchemy is fine as it is. The problem for me is how current raid content has been developed to absolutely require alchemy consumeables in order to succeed. I'm hoping the current dps consumeables will get outclassed by future gear to the point of being unnecessary, and that using potions/elixirs will be something to give you that added boost if you personally feel you need it but not hands-down required to win at something. I'm pretty sure that most people agree that spending a Saturday farming herbs for the coming week's raids is no one's idea of fun.<br>

Thankfully, Jewelcrafting has Designs for their items and not Patterns or the like.  Blizzard's habit of using the same term for completely different items (such as the Librams for enchanting and the Paladins' ranged slot) tends to drive me up the wall.  Or at least makes me want to send them a thesaurus.<br>

Engineering also appears to be getting several new Schematics.  The usual scopes and goggles but I also saw one for a five minute mailbox like the repair bot and a mote extractor, which might be a new resource that engineers can gather and sell (since little else in that profession is terribly profitable at high levels).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I'm not sure it becomes a matter of farming or of necessity.  But there should be some real benefits to having tradeskills other than alchemy.  Right now, you need one dude to make your guild Dark Iron stuff and someone to do Dreamscale BPs and Onyxia Scale Cloaks, and other than that, those tradeskills are pretty laughable.  It's a tricky design question, though, when it comes to what they could offer that would stimulate an active market the way we see for potions.  Crafting armor or weapons that are comparable to armor and weapons you can get from instances is rarely going to be worthwhile except for a select few items, and then people will get those items once (Lionheart Helm + Stronghold Gaunts + Titanic Legs for example) and never participate in that facet of the economy again.  I'm not sure there's a good answer without making everything into consumables, like sharpening stones, or leather armor patches that stack on top of enchants and give short-term powerful effects until they wear out.  But then you really just have a bunch of potion-like things in different packages, and that's not really satisfying either.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I'm not sure it becomes a matter of farming or of necessity.  But there should be some real benefits to having tradeskills other than alchemy.  Right now, you need one dude to make your guild Dark Iron stuff and someone to do Dreamscale BPs and Onyxia Scale Cloaks, and other than that, those tradeskills are pretty laughable.  It's a tricky design question, though, when it comes to what they could offer that would stimulate an active market the way we see for potions.  Crafting armor or weapons that are comparable to armor and weapons you can get from instances is rarely going to be worthwhile except for a select few items, and then people will get those items once (Lionheart Helm + Stronghold Gaunts + Titanic Legs for example) and never participate in that facet of the economy again.  I'm not sure there's a good answer without making everything into consumables, like sharpening stones, or leather armor patches that stack on top of enchants and give short-term powerful effects until they wear out.  But then you really just have a bunch of potion-like things in different packages, and that's not really satisfying either.</div>

	</tbody></table>
</div>Agreed, it's a hard design decision. I just think that alchemy has been taken to an extreme in Naxxramas and hope that they don't extend that extreme to other tradeskills in the expansion, which they could easily do if they wanted to (and judging from some of the Jewelcrafting Idols that can be created they may have).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_186070"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->That's a big problem with Tradeskills in every game imo. You have tradeskills that create "static" items, that usually scale very bad and have to rely on rare plans, using tons of expensive and annoying to gather materials, to create equal or subpar items for people who can't do end game content. And you have the tradeskills that give consumables, that everyone uses to get the same results. <br>
<br>
The problem is you'd have to add new recipes for every tradeskill every patch, that scale somewhat equally with current end game gear, but it's pretty hard cause you have to balance the reagent costs, the plans rarity and other factors. It's really hard to do, and usually the people who will be able to get these new plans are also able to get the very best gear available in the game, so they won't even use the plans for themselves.<br>
<br>
I think one of the good ideas that they didn't bother continuing were the Blacksmith trinket stuff. Soulbound items you can create, that don't replace important parts of armor and have interesting bonus. Another idea would be to have innate passive bonus depending on your skill. Artisan armorsmith? +5% armor(yea obviously it doesn't scale so well if you're a mage armorsmith but well). Alchemy is definitely the king of tradeskills, but the value on the actual potions is shit, there's very few ways as far as I know to make money off alchemy. Making flasks only get you so much cause most guilds will make their own flasks. The most used potions go for roughly their values in herbs. <br>
<br>
The real problem isn't between tradeskills imo, but between tradeskills and collection skills(herb/mining/skinning). Skinning isn't so hot because the materials are vastly underused, but being a miner can be quite profitable if you know the rich thorium spawns out of burning steppes, and being an herbalist is just easy money.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I thought Blizzard was trying to eliminate consumable dependency by nerfing the Blasted Lands stuff, Spirit of Zandalar, Zanzas, etc. Not to mention the one-food buff allowance and shared cooldowns -- ndb/tuber sharing healthstone/rune timer, for example. If consumables maintain their relative power come expansion, we could reasonably surmise that a Karazhan-equipped raid with a billion potions will have equal or greater power than a Black Citadel-equipped raid with zero consumables.<br>

I'd love to be proved wrong via the new 'rating' mechanic and its potential implications for limiting consumable buffs, but if these new potions are going to exist in the same system we have today, I'm fairly irked with Blizzard for not acknowledging the current issues with consumables. What level of out-of-raid prep time is reasonable as a ratio to attempt-time? Surely 1:1 is a maximum.<br>

		<div id="post_message_186078"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Before Naxx, potions always felt like they were there to push a little bit.  Protection potions to ease healing requirements as people learned fights, DPS potions to make the kill slightly faster.  We used DPS potions to help push our first kill after learning the fight.  There weren't any requirements to bring them, and a lot of people just used the cheap stuff occasionally.  And the guild brought Flask of the Titans for the tanks.<br>
<br>
After Naxx, consumable content is ridiculous.  Our main tanks are slamming down Stoneshield potions and Flask of the Titans.  Everyone can spend 10 or more gold on a Patchwerk wipe.  People are leaving alts in Scarlet Monastery (everyone is at friendly with Thorium Brotherhood now thanks ot the Kingsblood).  Fights are being designed around heavy consumable content, and it's not something gear will ever make up for.<br>
<br>
I enjoyed it when a profession gave a slight edge or a way to make some spare change.  They nerfed engineering in PvP because mind control caps and rocket helms were just too powerful, forcing all serious PvPers to get that.  I'm hoping that the expansion gets us back to the point where consumables are there for helping out at the learning stages and not "Patchwerk time.  Everyone buff up like crazy and drink your mana pots/runes on every cooldown."<br>
<br>
<br>
Edit: A one flask and one elixir maximum would be awesome.  Unlimited potions because those are meant to be used up quickly (Limited Invuln, Protection, etc).  Still doesn't solve the sheer power of mana potions though. Maybe each raid instance can sell zone-bound potions at a rep level associated with it.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_186108"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I like the idea of using mass consumables for end game raiding.  The problem is the fact that you have to spend so much time preparing for such encounters.  Instead, why not just increase the productivity? When picking dreamfoil, allow one node to provide 3-10 instead of 1-3.  Along with this, alchemists could make two or three potions from the same materials (it seems as though the expansion is expanding on this idea with the chance to create extra potions from one craft).  <br>
<br>
This way, raiders are still maximizing their capabilities but at a much lower cost and time investment.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I'm not sure it becomes a matter of farming or of necessity.  But there should be some real benefits to having tradeskills other than alchemy.  Right now, you need one dude to make your guild Dark Iron stuff and someone to do Dreamscale BPs and Onyxia Scale Cloaks, and other than that, those tradeskills are pretty laughable.  It's a tricky design question, though, when it comes to what they could offer that would stimulate an active market the way we see for potions.  Crafting armor or weapons that are comparable to armor and weapons you can get from instances is rarely going to be worthwhile except for a select few items, and then people will get those items once (Lionheart Helm + Stronghold Gaunts + Titanic Legs for example) and never participate in that facet of the economy again.  I'm not sure there's a good answer without making everything into consumables, like sharpening stones, or leather armor patches that stack on top of enchants and give short-term powerful effects until they wear out.  But then you really just have a bunch of potion-like things in different packages, and that's not really satisfying either.</div>

</div>A while ago I've posted some ideas on the EU official forums to check how much people care about current state of crafting. No one cares, it seems.<br>
<br>
To be succesful, crafting profession have to provide unique effects that appeal to large part of the realm community and fit WoW economy system. Right now only alchemy works like that. Engineering got unique effects, but is limited to engineers mostly. Enchanting got unique effects and appeals to mayority of players, but doesn't fit economy system well (no option to sell via AH). Tailoring/leatherworking/armorcrafting use raid materials to provide specialized raiding gear, which puts them in niche. Weaponcrafting... is pretty much dead on any mature server (one axe with unique raiding effect is not nearly enough). Because profession that provides items that directly compete with loot from dungeons and PvP is basically doomed.<br>
<br>
So yes, "potions called differently" (sharpening stones, chains, spikes and new effects like reinforced grip, pummel, poison applicators, sword breaker modification to name few possibilities) seem like be the only way to make those professions useful again.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<!-- message -->
		<div id="post_message_186140"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I don't see why they just integrate crafting into dungeon items, similar to that of Naxxramas, only instead of using turn ins torwards an NPC, you create the actual items.<br>
<br>
For example, if you kill King Jerk Fel-Orc, he drops a "Magical Harness", which is they key ingredient in about 5 different cloth shoulders of varying uses, and is more powerful than the actual drops off said boss.  You destroy the solo requirements of said item, while still sustaining the ability to make crafting useful.  It might be more forced, but it will sure as fuck make a Swordsmith happier when he can create the best sword "available" in Coilfang Resevoire.<br>
<br>
Much better example:<br>
Pattern: Shoulders of Spell Power<br>
+32 to spell damage<br>
+17 intellect<br>
+14 stamina<br>
<br>
Requires: <br>
Magical Harness (Drops off final boss of 5man Hellfire Citadel)<br>
2 Felcloth<br>
1 Rune Thread<br>
<br>
Pattern is available by completing a quest in the instance.<br>
<br>
This also allows you to artifically limit the availability of certain items in new ways, for example, if you have a cooldown based system, you can limit the amount of Epic Chest Piece of the Eagles in by putting a cooldown on them, or a reagent required.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_186142"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->In terms of weapon crafting, what about leaning more towards the 'eye of sulfuras' model.  Where you needed a rare item drop but were still required to get the item crafted.  Now in the case of sulfuras, it was usually the same guild that had the pattern since it came from an ingot but there seem to be be many possibilities for such patterns in the future regarding reputation, random world drops and boss kills.<br>

		<div id="post_message_186148"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->One thing was missed in this post, and I'm surprised it's gone so long without mentioning: the ability of one profession to create base MATERIALS which cannot be found in any other way.  The obvious examples are:<br>
<br>
Alchemy: arcanite<br>
Tailoring: mooncloth<br>
Leatherworking: refined salt<br>
<br>
The reason this is an excellent system is because the generation abilities are on day-long cooldowns (hence why DEing is basically profitless as a skill, unless you want mats from a BoP item).  Giving leatherworking and tailoring the ability to create materials that are highly valuable from materials that are not gives them a way to earn their daily bread.  These materials can then be used as base materials by an incredibly diverse number of quests and plans.  It does not matter that the market for Lionheart helms will saturate, because arcanite has so many uses it's price is relatively stable.<br>
<br>
The only flaw with the current implementation is they gave the most valuable "transmutation" (arcanite) to the crafting profession already associated with the most valuable gathering profession.  The least valued crafting and gathering pair (sknning / leatherworking) also got the least valuable "transmutation".  I'd like to see more of this in the future: each crafting profession having 1-2 ways of generating a unique material on a 1-4 day cooldown or something.  It would be easy to balance the most valuable transmutations to the least valuable professions (Flasks now require Refined Salt, anyone?) to keep the desirability of all crafting professions roughly the same.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Interesting point.  Using the cooldown-transmutations in raid-required consumables would be a trainwreck, even more so than what we already have with 3 herbalism alts camping grave moss and 1 more in the Hinterlands for ghost mushrooms.<br>
<br>
However, I stand by my idea of all professions having a "transmutation" to provide base materials for crafted items.

</div>I'm not sure it's enough to make those professions attractive. Currently main demand for salt, arcanite and mooncloth is related to quests, other crafters that make raid resistance gear and recent addition, tier III gear quests. Of course I can imagine more quests and more tier items that require crafter involvement, but in the end it would put crafters in very small niches - each of them would just log x time to use his cooldown to produce thing, that would be very remotely related to the name of his profession.<br>
<br>
Much better suggestion is mentioned above including special material drop on bosses that can be used by crafters to make items better then normal boss drops. Something like Pristine Hide of the Beast, but using real crafters, not NPCs. And with higher drop rate.<br>
<br>
I still think adding more potion-like effects to all the crafting professions is good all around solution. Upgrades that can be put on any armor/weapon will always be in bigger demand then single pieces of gear. Alchemy follows this rule, same with enchanting (although this profession is bottlenecked by ineffective distribution channels) and jewelcrafting will follow it as well.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
Essentially, there should be multiple hot spots in the game that either the alliance or the horde can claim at any given time - raw (rare) materials for crafting, special NPC vendors, quest NPCs, etc.  Or for a twist, have special areas which are always present for each team, but make them vulnerable to "destruction" so attacks from opponents could temporarily affect the productivity, or availability, of each.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
For example, if you kill King Jerk Fel-Orc, he drops a "Magical Harness", which is they key ingredient in about 5 different cloth shoulders of varying uses, and is more powerful than the actual drops off said boss.  You destroy the solo requirements of said item, while still sustaining the ability to make crafting useful.  It might be more forced, but it will sure as fuck make a Swordsmith happier when he can create the best sword "available" in Coilfang Resevoire.<br>
<br>
Much better example:<br>
Pattern: Shoulders of Spell Power<br>
+32 to spell damage<br>
+17 intellect<br>
+14 stamina<br>
<br>
Requires: <br>
Magical Harness (Drops off final boss of 5man Hellfire Citadel)<br>
2 Felcloth<br>
1 Rune Thread<br>
<br>
Pattern is available by completing a quest in the instance.<br>
<br>
This also allows you to artifically limit the availability of certain items in new ways, for example, if you have a cooldown based system, you can limit the amount of Epic Chest Piece of the Eagles in by putting a cooldown on them, or a reagent required.</div>

</div>While the idea is pretty cool, I'd guess Blizzard is reluctant to do so because they want to keep dungeon loot BoP. While I suppose it could be worked out so you can craft off of someone else carrying the necesarry materials, that'd require a fairly extensive change to the existing crafting system to facilitate it.<br>
On the other hand it would save on the whole "Hey, I just gave that guy 50 arcanite bars and a bunch of valuable gems and he ran off!" thing that you get now sometimes.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

An idea I've had kicking around in response to the limited resource spawns: Put in some 5-man instance with a lockdown timer of say 3 days. In it there are X wings each with minimal trash and a boss guarding a field of herbs. Each field would provide 15 spawns of a specific herb. If all you ever use is dreamfoil, go in with a group and get that or clear the whole thing and reap the profits. It would be hard to figure out the right balance since the playerbase would probably force it to be at least feasible for an all-blues group but letting it be farmed by raiding alts tips it toward overabundance. Then again, that last problem may not be such a bad thing.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Essence of fire, earth, core leather, frost runes and elementium ores are less interesting implementations.  They added obsidian chunks, but those have extremely limited uses and none are required to raid.  Bloodvine was better, as it was used in the resist sets for AQ40.  Souldarite and primal leathers were again kind of a flop, as they have no real raiding use.  The obvious example would be grave moss on the way to Loatheb.

After more digging I have no idea which gems, if any, to hoard for jewel crafting. It looks like there are recipes that use nearly everything in game, but I have no idea what the rates are for converting raw ore to gems and no idea how many gems and how many pieces of ore are used in the formulas. Given that, I'm just going to continue levelling an alt rogue to 300 mining and storing everything I get without smelting any of the ore. I don't think it's worth buying out the AH without knowing the drop rates from the jewel crafting version of smelting.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_186538"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->One idea to make crafting useful to raids is, as mentioned earlier, to make the sets craftable. Now the results of the crafting will be BoE, this is true. However if you include a BoP item as a requirement that is combined with the BoE in order to create the final item, you could a) make leatherworking/smithing/tailoring useful to raid groups and add another item class to the economy if people are willing to spend the dough to get the things that their raid group doesn't have yet.<br>
<br>
So you have the class item drop (mage, warlock, priest  chest piece) boe, the "misc" stuff boe (idols/coins/scarabs/etc), and then some sort of binding element that is BoP and the recipe that is BoP.  So the person getting the final item still has to raid to get the BoP part, but once they have that they can get the rest of it anywhere.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

 On the other hand, they already have some things in place that would emphasise the benefits without requiring immense time sinks. Cooldowns on transmutes create limits on the amount of items certain people can create in a time period. Combine that with potions that are Bind on Use, have unlimited charges, but are destroyed after x # of days. Now 1 alchemist can support x number of people with the buff. Who does he sell this limited but very useful ability to? The guild? The Market? a bit of both?<br>
 <br>
 Consider it like the blessing mechanic alliance guilds have to work out for raids. Who gets what blessing?<br>
 Now expand similar buffs for other professions, or move existing buffs to other professions.<br>

 Result : Less farming. Less time spent on the profession. A Strategy element to professions and the buffs they provide.</div>

I do remember something along the lines of it was a mistake to have resist gear drop off a boss that requires said resist gear (Viscidus) and also that it was a mistake to force players to farm a lower level instance to have the adequate resist for a boss (Huhuran).<br>
<br>
Both of those are accounted for in Naxx design. That is, there is significant craftable FrR gear for the one resist fight (Sapphiron) and neither Sapphiron or Kel'Thuzad drop frost resist gear.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I do remember something along the lines of it was a mistake to have resist gear drop off a boss that requires said resist gear (Viscidus) and also that it was a mistake to force players to farm a lower level instance to have the adequate resist for a boss (Huhuran).<br>
<br>
Both of those are accounted for in Naxx design. That is, there is significant craftable FrR gear for the one resist fight (Sapphiron) and neither Sapphiron or Kel'Thuzad drop frost resist gear.</div>

				Hi there, I'd like to talk to you today about Ancient Lichen.<br>
<br>
Ancient Lichen is a herb which is only found in the Coilfang Reservoir instances, (well not quite true, it has a 1% drop rate off "skinning" boglords), sort of like Dark iron used to be for BRD. This is all well and good if its ment to be a valuable good for rarely done crafting, however, Ancient Lichen is not!<br>
<br>
Lets Take a Look what <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081109235512/http://thottbot.com/beta?i=2984" target="_blank">Ancient Lichen</a> is used for:<br>
<br>
Elixir of Major Defense ( A must have for raiding tanks )<br>
Elixir of Major Firepower<br>
Elixir of Major Frost Power ( Both a must have for raiding mages depening on spec )<br>
Elixir of Major Shadow Power ( A must have for raiding warlocks )<br>
Elixir of Major Mageblood ( A must have for raiding healers (also prob for dps casters aswell, feel sorry for them))<br>
Flask of the Fortification ( The new "Flask of Titans" )<br>
Ironshield Potion ( The new "Greater Stoneshield Potion" )<br>
<br>
Maybe i'm being a little condescending, but you get the idea, It's just a touch silly that all these raiding pots require a herb only found in a 5man instance.<br>
<br>
Fake Edit: Oh, i forgot physical dps classes, they use potions that use easy to farm, outside world herbs, no problems for them.

</div>It wasn't, or at least I wasn't clear in what wasn't there.<br>
<br>
Right now, there is nothing a "casual" player, who runs 5 mans with friends, sits around IF, maybe does a few quests, a little farming, and a little PvP has to offer to me.  He can't farm as well as the dedicated farmers, and doesn't farm enough either.  He also values his time more highly and will tend to ask more for whatever he might have to sell (generally mats like dreamfoil and lotus).  There's no *reason* for me to buy anything from him; I can just talk to the farmer down the aisle and get him to bring me quantity at a discount.<br>
<br>
If mats are coming from inside of 5 mans, that "casual" player suddenly has something to offer - in the course of his normal gameplay, he's going to get stuff to sell to me.  He's going to get it more easily than a farmer will, and probably more of it.  All of a sudden, the raider-&gt;casual gold flow is there.  Now we just need something for me to offer him (high end crafted items, for example, or BoEs from raiding) to close that cycle and the economy suddenly does a much better job of keeping gold in the hands of *players* of the game, instead of people treating it as a job.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>We're going to have a bunch of pissed off raiders if it stays as is currently.  Either potions are going to have to be limited extremely, or you're going to be farming twice as much as you used to to keep your tank/caster/healer pots up.<br>
<br>
There's three spawns in the 63-64 instance (slave pens,) 5-6 spawns in the 64-65 instance (underbog,) and 5-6 in the 68-70 instance (steamvaults.)  I can only think of one of those spawns that a single player would be able to stealth to and harvest.  A druid/rogue duo would be capable of farming most of them, but a healthy amount of time of movement and risk would be involved.<br>
<br>
And for those unable to stealth, you're going to be running the instance.  I'm going to play around with the instances a bit tonight to see if it's possible to farm them, but right now, I think it's going to be be pretty bad.<br>
<br>
At least super mana potions are fairly easily farmed.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I went through and stealthed around all three of the instances a bit, to see what I could get.  There were five herb spawns in the steamvaults, and two of them were herbable by a solo stealther.  The other three were unaccessable to anything less than a 5 man group.<br>

The Slave Pens had 4 herb spawns that I could find before I ran into stealth detecting mobs, will need a small stealther group to acquire the other 3-4 throughout the rest of the zone.  3 of those 4 were herbable by a solo 70 stealther.<br>
<br>
The underbog had 4 herb spawns up until the hydra boss, which means a 3-4 man group will be necessary to get any more out of the instance.  Was able to herb all 4 spawns before then.<br>

If there are a decent amount of spawns in there, the raiding itself could cover a part of the farming. Apart from this small hope I'm very dissapointed in all the consumables available, it adds to the game sure but there should be like 1-2 elixirs per class and maybe a burst pot, not 5 plus flask. I believe Naxx raised the cap on whats ok to ask of the raid to farm, and it will change our perspective in TBC. Uber guilds will have all these pots farmed even before black temple is released, they will expect them to be required, and we a more mediocre guild will have to be prepared to do the same or we will lag too far behind.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
Making certain consumable ingredients really rare (not just grave moss rare, but even moreso), then maybe top level consumables become a thing which they really can expect no-one to be able to get enough of to always have every attempt.  Loatheb was balanced around the existance of GSPP, but what if SM farming for ingredients wasn't available?  It could have been balanced on the basis that people could get an easier kill if they managed to scrape together 80-120 GSPP, but also that that many GSPP would not be possible to farm consistently.<br>
<br>
Blizzard shouldn't care if intermediate bosses can be "cheesed" with mass consumables as long as mass consumables is too much pain for the reward (Loatheb was the edge of what's possible, and was I suspect over the edge for many).<br>
<br>
If people are willing to flask an entire raid to beat TBC's equivalent of Vael or Huhuran, let them.  Balance the end-boss, the "world first" prize, around a raid doing whatever it takes.  But nothing else.  And then make "whatever it takes" really difficult.  Flasks requiring multiple primal nether might be a good start :)<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Sounds pretty awful to me. I'm already afraid of the fights in TBC that will require "raw output" from the raid, aka Patchwerk/Loatheb/Sapphiron/Gothik/Thaddius. Any fight that you go into feeling ridiculously more comfortable buffed than unbuffed is not a good fight, I feel. For example; 4 Horsemen feels almost useless to world buff on, because it's tuned to aggro/rotation management, not raw DPS/Healing/Damage Input. <br>
<br>
In any case, it was bad enough in Naxx, but Naxx really introduced us (the raiding population) to buffing heavily very regularly. And I really, really hope it isn't necessary in TBC.<br>

<br>
Truth be told, I am somewhat for this plan of action.  I do have a rogue however, so the herbs will be obtainable to me with some time invested.  Reset the instance 5 times and while I'm waiting for the reset just stick around till the soloable herbs respawn, pick them and then reset again.<br>
<br>
We'll have to see how it plays out.  When I had more time I generally just waited till the off-hours for my server, farming in the early morning to get what I needed.  And even THEN in the past 4 months I have been unable to find a thorium vein or a black lotus.<br>
<br>
If it all goes as it seems to, I'd be more in favor of this plan, but that's solely dependant upon how many professional farmers are rogues and do this themselves.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Also, unrelated, I really like Elixir mastery, the double creation rate is pretty good (I'd estimate around 20%), and it can proc off itself, seeing that I made three elixirs out of the mats for one was a bit of a surprise.</div>

It's on the same level as the alchemy trainer, just on the other side of the hut.  You can make flasks while standing at the trainer.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Pretty hard to pick what mastery to take... transmute mastery could be huge if you get 2 primal might out of 1 set of mats for example, but even at a 20% proc rate thats only once per 5 days... hmm<br>

However that depends on the amount the instance provides and the ease of collection.  If its too low then you just get a lot of pissed of raiders when they are raiding nax 2.0 and have to run a 5 man 10 times a week for their pots.</div>

</div>Sorry to quote an older posting. But I wanted to write this about gathering in general.<br>
<br>
Please bear with me, I give a simple way to proof my claims yourself, if you want to spend the time for it, that is.<br>
<br>
<br>
Many people simply think that all there is to gathering professions boils down to installing an addon (gatherer) possibly with preloaded spawnpoints and just be there quicker or when less people are around. And that's it - all of it. However, like all professions, there are certain things well worth knowing. One of the least known things seems to be how spawn points "work".<br>
<br>
Please note that this pertains fully to the normal, live, official servers. I've never played on any non-official ones (why would one anyhow, when you can get the real deal) so I don't know what "they" do. In any case, at the bottom is a way to see for yourself, should you find my text that unimaginable strange and unthinkable. Also my main experience is with herbs but now I have an alt miner and it seems to be exactly the same thing.<br>
<br>
So, enough introduction, here's the meat:<br>
<br>
Each zone with herbalism nodes has some values associatied with these nodes. For one, there is a maximum number. A specific zone can never ever have more than X nodes active, ie pick-/mine-able at any one time. That is, if a zone is completely devoid of any players, you can wait for an infinity, there won't ever come a point where ALL nodes are populated and active. Furthermore, there is a "natural respawn" rate (I call it natural to differentiate from the unnatural respawn players <b>can</b> cause). Start with any zone, let no-one enter the zone and there slowly will be a respawn at the zone's rate up until the max number of active nodes is reached, at which point no natural respawn occurs anymore.<br>
<br>
So far so good, most of you probably knew that or at least felt that this is so. Cool, but where's the real thing now? Well, what almost no-one seems to know is that there is one more value, and this one has huge consequences, as far as gathering is concerned. There is also a minimum value of active nodes in a given zone ! When the minimum amount is reached and a node is picked/mined, the game <b>instantly</b> respawns a randomly chosen node in the zone! Now read that previous sentence again. And again. Do you realize the consequences and what this really means, especially wrt the part I quoted ?<br>
<br>
So why is there a shortage on certain herbs, if you can basically force the game to spawn one (albeit at a random location) ? The problem is, that people tend to be very picky (pun intended) when gathering herbs. For example, in Azshara, people pick Dreamfoil, but don't pick Sungrass oder Purple Lotus. And this is bad. When you factor in those mechanisms above, if you only pick one out of many herbs in a given zone, the respawns are either a) what you seek or b) what you don't want. If it's a, then fine but if it's b, it sort of "wastes" a herb spot. And this DOES create a shortage on your useful herb.<br>
<br>
Lesson learned: Always pick all herbs. Not just dreamfoil. Not just gromsblood. All. You will create spawns in heavily farmed zones and this in turn may result in spawns "in front of you" in your farming direction you are heading. <br>
<br>
Note that I never tried to verify that in instances, ie SM. Since all wings are in fact one single instance, but every wing as far as the spawn-area is concerne is perfectly solo-able by level 60 chars, this isn't that difficult to do, should anyone like to.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now how you can verify that what I just wrote really is having this effect. There is currently one zone in this game, where you can see the effect of the spawnpoint mechanic very well and with a minimum of effort.<br>
<br>
Go to the blasted lands (that's where the portal and Kazzak is). This zone is relatively small (kazzak area has no herbs), yet contains highly valued herbs (gromsblood). Spend a bit of time to find an optimal path trough the zone, touching all herb nodes that are in the zone. Do not forget the altar in the mountain area, there are 3 or 4 gromsblood spawn points there too!<br>
<br>
Now when you have your somewhat circular path ride it along and only pick gromsblood, if any. You will run out of the nodes very fast. (Note that since 2.0 there is one node that cannot be picked since the herb just floats in the air at the entrance to the portal). Now once you ensured that indeed no new nodes spawned, pick all nodes. And always run the same path. Each time you do a complete circle, there will always be new, fresh nodes. Some will be gromsblood, some won't. But you are currently causing the game to spawn them for you, as the minimum number of active nodes in this zone seems to be 3 or 4. Still not convinced? Go into the zone with your friendly co-herbalists. Go on vent or TS and split up. Each one picking a herb is to announce where and when. You will see that as soon as one is picked at the minimum value, another one pops up somewhere else.<br>
<br>
So to sum it all up: Gathering professions do have an internal mechanism and aren't just "install gatherer and go" thingies. Due to this mechanics, there can't be ever "too few" of any one herb. Claiming so is saying that you don't understand how gathering works, which however is extremely widespread and extremly seldom documented. There can, however, be too many farmer just picking one type out of many and thus creating a situation where there are many non-desired non-picked herbs which due to the randomness of a respawn make the desired herb more rare than need be.<br>
<br>
Hopefully, this information helps some of you. I, for one, have always been able to get any amount of gromsblood, whenever I want. Limited only by the time I invested in running around in the blasted lands.<br>
<br>
There is of course the exception to the rule, and this is the black lotus. I've heard many stories about it's spawn time, and I've never been able to confirm myself any of them. There are currently two hypthesis about them of which I think one of them is what really happens: the "only one at any time in one zone and respawns exactly 1 hrs after picking" thesis and the "only one at any time in one zone but can respawn instantly" thesis.<br>
<br>
Most people that are interested in the subject seem to tend to the first one, though I also had people tell me that they did indeed get two within a hour in one zone, without a server restart or anything special. Personally I have never witnessed more than one within one hour, at most I've been able to extract 3 or so out of one zone in a day and I wasn't specifically camping the spawn points, merely passing by and was very lucky. This too, however, would actually be testable, if you find enough herbalists, who are willing to spend more than one hour and each one "guards" a spawn point. 1 hour without anything special and 1 hour while they are guarding, many more herbalists try to farm the area, picking all they can in order to try to force a respawn. That would probably be a good test, but I do lack the motivation to pull this one off. Maybe one of you wants to do this, one time.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Each Primal Might is going to be worth a stack of cash, with the mats to make it being the Outland equivalent of 5 different elemental essences, <i>plus</i> a transmute being required. It's easy to see them being worth 50g+ each. That's a lot of bonus money to be made if your transmute nets you two Primal Mights instead of one. Of course, I have no idea what the likelihood of Transmutation Master "proc'ing" is.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>No, the limitation on profit from potions is demand.  Which in my experience is very, very close to zero.  The thing is that potions can me made in any amount for which you can provide materials.  Anyone with an alchemist buddy or alt can therefore turn mats into potions at an unlimited rate, reducing the price of the potion to the sum of its mats.  Transmuted goods on the other hand are inherently limited in supply by the timer, which creates profit.<br>
<br>
There is some money to be made in selling potions-of-convenience during certain times, such as various Greater Protection potions at the peak of Naxx raiding.  But unless the potion/elixir spec proc rate is improbably high, I don't see it contributing more to total profit than transmute spec.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

But at a guild level a potion master and elixer master who have every recipe and rep available and everybody else be transmutation masters works pretty well as long as your selected potion and elixer masters are still active guild members. Sure if you want a few Super Mana potions make them yourself, but when you want 20 Greater Arcane Protection potions then go to your Guild potion master and hopefully he will get 22 or 25 or whatever the proc rate is likely to give. I know in my guild between alts and mains we had 17 level 300 alchemists, 10-13 transmute masters would probably be appropriate.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Six months from now when the masses have hit level 70, we'll see the same thing with Primal Might transmutes that we saw with Arcanite Bar transmutes: hawking the transmute for 5g a combine.  The only new benefit is keeping the bonus transmute, which I'm sure will be drama filled until people get accustomed to it.<br>
<br>
25/36 <a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=23571#z0z" target="_blank">items that use Primal Might</a> also require Primal Nether, which is a true bottleneck.  Half of those are BoP items.  Out of the remaining 11 items, the Riding Crop will be highly desired and every TBC-enabled enchanter will need the rods.  However, there's no reoccurring need for Primal Might aside from Enchant Weapon - Sunfire, which has a limited audience.  When raiding, you can count on a reoccurring need for more potions and elixirs, but not transmutes.  So I'm inclined to go with potions or elixirs instead.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_275487"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->What i see is the problem, is that potion/elixir mastery will in effect do nothing but lower the price that you will be able to sell potions at.  With no limiting factor, everyone who took potion mastery will be producing (Potion + X*Potion), where X is your proc rate.  <br>
<br>
You basically introduce more goods into the market than it costs to produce in materials.  That will bring down the value of the good you are producing as you are increasing the supply.  You would be fine if the demand would also rise to meet the introduction of more potions, but that requires special circumstances, like the Naxx shadow pot fiasco.  <br>
<br>
It may very well happen that your better off transmuting X to Primal Air in the future, rather than primal might.  Either way, the only real limitation on any craftable item is time.  People who are not willing to wait that time are going to be shelling out for Primal Might, most notably the tier 1 BSmithing weapons.<br>
<br>
EDIT:  Forgot to read the post above mine, did some restating.<br>
<br>
Speaking of Primal Air, there is a ton of recipes that use it.  I would imagine it will be a big selling point.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_275545"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->When I was alchemist on my old rogue, I made by far the most money from transmutes. Potions and elixirs were only a moneymaker when there were only a few folks able to make the stuff (GFP comes in my mind) and when you farmed the mats own your own (essentially the real moneymaker was herbalism therefore). The choices also depend on the way your guild economy is run. My old guild had only very informal rules,  you could ask for some crafting or mats but there were no guarantees somebody would supply them. If your guild economy is more organized you will want to have 2-3 potion and elixir masters each (in order to spread the workload and to have some redundancy in case somebody quits, gets banned and so on). All the other alchemists should be transmuters imho, since this is where the bottleneck in terms of time lies. Even though an individual transmute for outsiders might only cost 5 G, its more than what you get from someone who brings you the mats for some potions (and only few folks do so, most players have a good alchemist on their list who will provide his services for no costs charged - this might be reduced by the introduction of the masteries, but I doubt that this custom will disappear). Often you can buy the transmute mats on your own and resell the result of the transmutation if you don't care for spamming the trade channel. As most crafting professions this might not make you rich on its own but it will give you a steady source of income in order to pay your bills.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I've never found that mass production of potions or elixirs made any money at all.... the cost of mats was only slightly below the cost of sale, and AH cuts and the occasional failed sale ate right into the profit.  Only rare recipes made any money.<br>
<br>
Maybe with the specializations in TBC things will change.  But probably not -- anything that can be made with no cooldown and is a big profit will have its supply flooded quickly once people find out, and in the end its the materials that are the limiting factor to supply and hence are where the money is.<br>
<br>
I had friends who said they made their money back after paying 300G for greater fire pot recipe, but I looked at the prices of the sale versus  the materials and the margin was very slim.  I think they didn't factor in the fact that they could sell the materials for 95% the price of the finished product.     Heart of fire transmutes though... they still make money today.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

But at a guild level a potion master and elixer master who have every recipe and rep available and everybody else be transmutation masters works pretty well as long as your selected potion and elixer masters are still active guild members. Sure if you want a few Super Mana potions make them yourself, but when you want 20 Greater Arcane Protection potions then go to your Guild potion master and hopefully he will get 22 or 25 or whatever the proc rate is likely to give. I know in my guild between alts and mains we had 17 level 300 alchemists, 10-13 transmute masters would probably be appropriate.</div>

That, might be profitable but you will have to spend a lot of time peddling your potion making and isn't much different than making them and AH'ing them except for the auction cut and you shield yourself from material acquisition price risk.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_275929"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->The question for Potion and Elixir mastery is: how much throughput are you going to have?  If you're in a situation where you're making potions for a lot of people, be it as a known Alchy on the server who sits in capital cities or just as a friendly Alchy suppling your guild's raids, then Potion / Elixir mastery is strong.  It doesn't even matter if you make the potions for free (and I expect most people will).  You simply wish to <b>handle</b> as many herbs as possible, and you'll have a steady stream of "procs" that are pure profit for you.<br>
<br>
If you do not think a large volume of herbs will be funnelled through you by others, then transmutations looks like the way to go.  Every alchemist will probably be using one transmute or another whenever the cooldown is up.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_276008"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->It's far more valueable to the transmuter to get two for one rather than a 'free' cooldown. Typically the 'cost' of the transmute will be fairly market based, i.e. Arcane Transmute was 5g. However, if the material cost of the item is high, you create more value. <br>
<br>
For instance, assume the base material was 50g, transumate fee is 5, a Two for One proc would net you 55g in profit. Where as a free cooldown gives you 5g in profit. I know which I would want.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Avoiding the cooldown would be a huge nerf to transmuting masters.  Look at how it would have worked for arcanite.  If you get a free arcanite bar on a proc that is a 20 to 30g value where if you got another transmute and had the matts to use it right away you got 5 or 10g depending on prices.<br>
<br>
Anyway the free extra of whatever you transmute will probably give a topic to replace "Who has a right to the Pristine Hide of the Beast: skinner or group?" threads that pop up every month or so on the offical forums.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_276134"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Does anyone have an inkling about what the % of getting a free transmute/elixir/potion is?<br>
<br>
My thoughts on which to pick are as follows:<br>
<br>
Potion spec seems the weakest.  It's never been profitable to sell major health and mana potions, as money farmers get those from farming and dump them on the AH.  Ironically the only ones that do sell are the lower level ones for people's alts.<br>
<br>
Elixir spec seems really nice due to all the new elixirs they added.  I don't imagine you'd make any money this way, because people just get their guildies to make stuff for them, and solo players don't pay for buffs.  And even though you wouldn't make any money, you would save money with all your free elixirs, especially as a raider.  I'll file this one in the "a penny saved is a penny earned" category.<br>
<br>
Transmute spec seems like the early favorite.  There's going to be a mad rush for everyone to get their fancy craftables from blacksmithing, or whatever.  Then I imagine the market will dry up just like it did with essence of air and arcanite back in the day.  The only "consumable" that needs transmutes are jewelcrafting, and I doubt there'd be a lot of turnover on that.  I'm nervous about this one, because my gut's telling me to take it to cash in on the short term goldrush, even though I have doubts about it's long-term viability.  If the proc rate of a free transmute is too low, then the luster of this one becomes even worse.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_276171"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->My take on the specializations depends somewhat on a factor I have not heard anything about.  From what I understand, other professions have BoP craftables that require X specialization.  This includes tailoring, leatherworking, blacksmithing, and engineering.  Now, naturally they can't do this for alchemy <i>but</i> if I had to guess, the specialization will affect the recipes you can learn through the discovery feature.  If this is the case, all of the specializations will be valuable to an extent (although, as has been stated already, there may not be a demand for certain types of consumables).<br>
<br>
Potions masters will do the health pots, mana pots, and protection pots.<br>
Elixir masters will do all the other (raid) buff pots.<br>
Transmute masters will make money.<br>
<br>
Depending on the number of transmute masters on the server (and especially if my guess is correct), it may actually be more profitable to go for elixirs and potions instead.  If this thread is any indication, the market may very well be flooded with primal &lt;insert here&gt;.<br>

</div>if I remember correctly, combat log shows all kinds of professions "outcomes" (including bandages, pots, transmutes, etc) unless the profession in the options is ticked off - I remember I had it on very early in the game and seeing what everyone around me was making standing near the IF mailbox... was very spammy though. <br>
<br>
You can still see it in the group, since you see the "recieves X (loot)" part. I think. <br>
<br>
And i totally agree, the "extra" transmute product issue will produce big drama... although, all the people that said "i would give my friend/guildy both primals (if it procs), but not to strangers", this opens the question, aren't you effectively implying that supplied mats are the decisive factor, and not your specialization? If you would give the extra to a friend, same logic demands you give it to the "stranger" as well. <br>

By default, you "deserve" the extra transmute.  It's your skill, and unless specifically stated, the other person is paying you to transmute his set of mats into one particular item.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Of course, better to avoid drama in the first place from this by pre-transmuting.  Besides allowing for safer transactions and drama-less transmuting, it allows you to get better prices.

1.) Pay 5g for transmuting 1xJunk-&gt; 1xValuable Junk. <br>
2.) Pay 10g (some arbitrary higher price) for transmuting 1xJunk-&gt; Whatever comes out. <br>
2.) Pay 5g for transmuting 1xValuable Junk, with the option to buy a 2nd one at discounted price should I get 2 instead of 1.  <br>
<br>
Other alchemists are free to adjust their pricing to meet market demand. <br>

</div>Limiting the discussion to friends (or lets say guild members) and disenchanting (part of the profession that takes some material and produces some other material from it). It is normal to provide free service for them and I don't mind that.<br>
My comparaison was that, if you expect me to provide free service, giving away every dust/essence/shard that comes from the disenchant, you should provide it as well (give away both potions/elixirs/transmutes products in case of a proc).<br>
<br>
And for the people saying that enchanting is a cheep profession because it does not have a huge cooldown, I spent 400 gold worth of reagents yesterday for leveling my enchanting to 325. I didn't earn anything for it. No one is going to pay for enchanting +100HP on a chest or +5spirit on boots at a time they frequently change their gear and there are more powerful enchants coming.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Dunno, that just speaks to me of an attitude of generosity towards guildies.  <br>
<br>
<br>
By default, you "deserve" the extra transmute.  It's your skill, and unless specifically stated, the other person is paying you to transmute his set of mats into one particular item.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Of course, better to avoid drama in the first place from this by pre-transmuting.  Besides allowing for safer transactions and drama-less transmuting, it allows you to get better prices.  (selling the product when transmute price is high, instead of trying to find a person who wants a transmute at a particular point in time.)</div>

</div>Does this mean I, as an enchanter, can carry with me a stack of dusts/shards/essences and trade few of them with someone asking me to disenchant something? Or take 10% of what I get from disenchanting 2 pages of mail from someone? After all, it's my skill as well. And even if disenchanting it self does not require some big investment, having enchanting as a profession (especially while leveling) is really expensive.<br>

</div>Gotta agree with Kalman on this subject.  Disenchanting is a terribly flawed argument to use against transmute masters.<br>
<br>
1. Disenchanting gives a variable amount of product by default<br>
2. You can't spec to give more mats from a disenchant, and if you could there would be no way to tell how much was extra because of #1<br>
3. Transmutes have a fixed transaction quantity. 1 for 1.<br>
4. If you use one of your specializations to get 1 more every once in a while, that 1 more is yours and yours alone unless you are feeling nice that day.<br>
<br>
Enchanters make money from selling enchants.  Enchanters can disenchant with no cooldown (just for the <i>mats</i> for their money maker).  Alchemists make money selling potions and transmutes.  Transmutes have a cooldown.  Capisch?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I think that much is true.  However, I'm going to be going elixir.<br>
<br>
My reasoning: <br>
Assuming you have someone else in your guild who is potion/elixir spec, there will be no reason for you to make pots, unless that person doesn't sign on.  You'd essentially have the profession for transmutes, and transmutes alone.  The point was brought up earlier: you're throwing away the chance of free/extra potions/elixirs if you make them yourself and are transmute specialized.  <br>
<br>
I know it's just a personal thing, but I'd hate to have a profession to use for only 30 seconds every 1/2 days.    And if you're going to use it for transmutes and transmutes alone, i.e. as a moneymaker, you'd be better off grabbing a second gathering profession and selling what you collect.  But really, that's just a silly self-perception of mine.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

An interesting note, honor hold is auto-seeded for everyone, once I got to allerian I had the flight path to HH already in my map so everything got connected.  I assume it would be the same for horde.<br>

Leveled her alchemy to 350 easy and now I can transmute primal mights :)  Can't learn alchemy specialization unfortunately, thats a level 70 quest.  All the other transmutes are also rep based rewards so can't pick any of them up.  It was trivial leveling up to 350 with a few stacks of dreamfoil, silversage, felwood, terrocone, and the other two top herbs (didn't even use my lichen!).  Did cost about 80g, mostly due to the imbued vials and recipes.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I don't think this has ever been confirmed, however, a bunch of transmute paths are conspicuously missing.<br>

The only transmutes currently available in-game are the "inner square" of Air-&gt;Fire-&gt;Earth-&gt;Water-&gt;Air (mirroring what we had at the Essence level).  However, Life, Mana, and Shadow aren't currently connected to anything, and I think it's expected that things like Life&lt;-&gt;Earth will eventually crop up somewhere.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Sorry, perhaps I need to reword it, as none of the information I'm looking for has been mentioned yet. Also I meant on Live since as we've noticed (dreamless pots / Khorium) things are not always the same from beta -&gt; live.<br>
<br>
I didn't see any of the previous posts mention Potion/Transmute Mastery (other than the ethical conflict of transmuting for others)<br>
<br>
The picture linked earlier shows multiple elixir mastery 'procs'. Have any of the other masteries encountered the same? Before that picture I assumed you would only make one extra (2 for 1). Just curious if it can happen for the others (potion/transmute) I'd guess the potion could proc between 1-4 extra.<br>
<br>
As soon as I start regular transmuting (with mastery) I'm going to keep a record of what I transmute and what I recieve. Maybe in a few weeks I'll have some sort of proc rate for it. <br>
<br>
And anyone seen or heard of the cost (or even posibility) of respecing to another Mastery?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>According to a thread on the WoW Profession Forum, here's an incomplete list:<br>
<br>
Flask of Arcane Fortification (while making Onslaught Elixir, Super Mana Potions)<br>
Flask of Relentless Assault (while making Volatile Healing Potion, Super Healing Potion)<br>
Flask of Mighty Restoration (while making Adept's Elixir, Elixir of Major Agility)<br>
Flask of Fortification (while making Elixir of Mastery, Super Healing Potion, Adept's Elixir)<br>
Flask of Shadow Fortification (while making Elixir of Major Agility)<br>
<br>
From the looks of it most, if not all, of the outlands recipes have a chance of discovering a new flask.  The skill doesn't matter it seems, since some people made the discovery while making orange recipes, while others got it from grey ones.  The number of potions to make to achieve a discovery is greatly varied as well.<br>
<br>
My biggest question is that if I had discovered something while making Adept's Elixir for example, will I be able to obtain another discovery making the same thing or is it a one discovery per known recipe kind of deal?  Also, while there are some overlapping in the data (such as Elixir of Major Agility can discover both Flask of Mighty Restoration and Shadow Fortification), do all potions have an equal chance of discovering a flask or only certain ones can?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_277359"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Here is what I've discovered so far about certain herbs (I figured it fit here since herbalism and alchemy go hand in hand).<br>
<br>
Mana Thistle: Only grows in Terokkar, Nagrand, Blade's Edge, Netherstorm and Shadowmoon. In addition it can only be found in areas of each map that can only be accessed by flight.<br>
<br>
Netherbloom: Only grows in Netherstorm (seems obvious). In addition it gives a random buff or debuff that gives or takes 50 of a random stat (i.e. +50str or -50sta) for 15 minutes.<br>
<br>
Nightmare Vine: Only grows in Shadowmoon Valley. Haven't picked any yet don't know if there are any effects.<br>
<br>
Terocone: Only grows in Terokkar Forest.<br>
<br>
Dreaming Glory: Only grows in Mountainous/Hilly areas but grows in every zone (Very similar to mountain silversage). Grants a small 30health every 5 seconds buff that last 15 minutes.<br>
<br>
Ancient Lichen: Only grows in Auchenai and Coilfang instances (I think). In addition this CAN be herbed off the bog lords in Zangarmarsh.<br>
<br>
Fel Lotus: Very small chance to be found in ANY of the herbs found in Outland.<br>
<br>
A few questions regarding herbalism for those that might know:<br>
<br>
1) Does Mana Thistle work similarly to Black Lotus (i.e. are there only a few spawns available worldwide at any given point in time)?<br>
<br>
2) Are there any other herbable non-instanced mobs that have a chance to drop Netherbloom, Nightmare Vine or Mana Thistle?<br>
<br>
Since many of these herbs are found only in one zone and are used in a lot of the better recipes I can see serious bottlenecking issues come raid time. Especially on higher pop servers. Many flasks use 10-20 of these zone specific herbs. I'd start mass herb farming now and forget about rep til later if you want to have enough mats to make those flasks.<br>
<br>
Dreamfoil was bad because it was used in almost every good recipe but at least it grew in many, many zones.<br>

		<div id="post_message_276134" class="post_message_underline">Does anyone have an inkling about what the % of getting a free transmute/elixir/potion is?<br>
<br>
My thoughts on which to pick are as follows:<br>
<br>
Potion spec seems the weakest.  It's never been profitable to sell major health and mana potions, as money farmers get those from farming and dump them on the AH.  Ironically the only ones that do sell are the lower level ones for people's alts.<br>
<br>
Elixir spec seems really nice due to all the new elixirs they added.  I don't imagine you'd make any money this way, because people just get their guildies to make stuff for them, and solo players don't pay for buffs.  And even though you wouldn't make any money, you would save money with all your free elixirs, especially as a raider.  I'll file this one in the "a penny saved is a penny earned" category.<br>
<br>
Transmute spec seems like the early favorite.  There's going to be a mad rush for everyone to get their fancy craftables from blacksmithing, or whatever.  Then I imagine the market will dry up just like it did with essence of air and arcanite back in the day.  The only "consumable" that needs transmutes are jewelcrafting, and I doubt there'd be a lot of turnover on that.  I'm nervous about this one, because my gut's telling me to take it to cash in on the short term goldrush, even though I have doubts about it's long-term viability.  If the proc rate of a free transmute is too low, then the luster of this one becomes even worse.</div>

		<div id="post_message_276171" class="post_message_underline" style="min-height: 183px;">My take on the specializations depends somewhat on a factor I have not heard anything about.  From what I understand, other professions have BoP craftables that require X specialization.  This includes tailoring, leatherworking, blacksmithing, and engineering.  Now, naturally they can't do this for alchemy <i>but</i> if I had to guess, the specialization will affect the recipes you can learn through the discovery feature.  If this is the case, all of the specializations will be valuable to an extent (although, as has been stated already, there may not be a demand for certain types of consumables).<br>
<br>
Potions masters will do the health pots, mana pots, and protection pots.<br>
Elixir masters will do all the other (raid) buff pots.<br>
Transmute masters will make money.<br>
<br>
Depending on the number of transmute masters on the server (and especially if my guess is correct), it may actually be more profitable to go for elixirs and potions instead.  If this thread is any indication, the market may very well be flooded with primal &lt;insert here&gt;.<br>
<br>
Edit: Left out a word.</div>

</div>if I remember correctly, combat log shows all kinds of professions "outcomes" (including bandages, pots, transmutes, etc) unless the profession in the options is ticked off - I remember I had it on very early in the game and seeing what everyone around me was making standing near the IF mailbox... was very spammy though. <br>
<br>
You can still see it in the group, since you see the "recieves X (loot)" part. I think. <br>
<br>
And i totally agree, the "extra" transmute product issue will produce big drama... although, all the people that said "i would give my friend/guildy both primals (if it procs), but not to strangers", this opens the question, aren't you effectively implying that supplied mats are the decisive factor, and not your specialization? If you would give the extra to a friend, same logic demands you give it to the "stranger" as well. <br>

By default, you "deserve" the extra transmute.  It's your skill, and unless specifically stated, the other person is paying you to transmute his set of mats into one particular item.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Of course, better to avoid drama in the first place from this by pre-transmuting.  Besides allowing for safer transactions and drama-less transmuting, it allows you to get better prices.  (selling the product when transmute price is high, instead of trying to find a person who wants a transmute at a particular point in time.)</div>

</div>Sure.   It's a business transaction.   Figure out what both of you think is fair.  <br>
<br>
For me, I'll just find out ahead of time whether the person wants to:  <br>
1.) Pay 5g for transmuting 1xJunk-&gt; 1xValuable Junk. <br>
2.) Pay 10g (some arbitrary higher price) for transmuting 1xJunk-&gt; Whatever comes out. <br>
2.) Pay 5g for transmuting 1xValuable Junk, with the option to buy a 2nd one at discounted price should I get 2 instead of 1.  <br>
<br>
Other alchemists are free to adjust their pricing to meet market demand. <br>

</div>Limiting the discussion to friends (or lets say guild members) and disenchanting (part of the profession that takes some material and produces some other material from it). It is normal to provide free service for them and I don't mind that.<br>
My comparaison was that, if you expect me to provide free service, giving away every dust/essence/shard that comes from the disenchant, you should provide it as well (give away both potions/elixirs/transmutes products in case of a proc).<br>
<br>
And for the people saying that enchanting is a cheep profession because it does not have a huge cooldown, I spent 400 gold worth of reagents yesterday for leveling my enchanting to 325. I didn't earn anything for it. No one is going to pay for enchanting +100HP on a chest or +5spirit on boots at a time they frequently change their gear and there are more powerful enchants coming.</div>

Granted, the object being created is significantly more valuable, but over time, it will still equate to a profit margin of ~20% (or whatever the proc rate - and by proc rate, I mean the chance of getting one "extra" [a 2x counts as one, 3x as two, and so forth)  happens to be) and you can only do it once per day, so your earnings are effectively capped at the market price of the item being created times the proc rate (I'm guessing Primal Might will level out at somewhere around 50-100g each [as most servers seem to have them around 200g right now, this seems like a reasonable estimate], so with a proc rate of 20%, you'll be making 10-20g/day from your mastery).<br>
<br>
Why not go with potion/elixir mastery where your earnings are only capped by the amount the herbs you have? As a former "guild" alchemist (fairly small guild, but still), I usually made around 50g worth of potions per day, but keep in mind that this was with "old-world" potions. The newer potions are obviously going to be much more expensive, so reaching the point where you are creating items with a combined value of more than whatever the "best" transmute is will be much easier than before.<br>
<br>
I guess it depends on if you are planning on creating massive amounts of potions for a raiding guild or just have alchemy as a "fire and forget" cash source on an alt.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_281106"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->If the proc rate is the same across the professions, I'd need to be making 50-100g worth of potions, EVERY DAY, to match transmute mastery.  I'm not the guild alchemist; if I need potions or elixirs, I'll go to a pot/elixir master and have them make them instead (although for one-offs, I'll probably just accept the potential loss and make it myself.)<br>
<br>
New potions will level out at the same cost, possibly cheaper, than old potions - they require the same amount of mats, and the price of herbs is effectively set by the difficulty of acquiring them, and herbs aren't exactly in short supply in Outlands.  In addition, the wider availability of most herbs, and the possibility of farming Botanica for herbs, seems to me to suggest that herb availability will actually be *improved*, leading to a price drop in herbs, and therefore potions, over time.  I'd personally bet on, long-term, potion prices settling to roughly the same price points as before.<br>
<br>
The other thing to consider is that potions were rarely a money-maker over the base herbs, while transmutes usually represented added value.  I'm making value on a transmute whether or not I get a proc.  Potion/elixir mastery suffers from the problem that the base action (the 80% result) has no added value, or even a loss in value, and that the resultant can be quite hard to sell.<br>
<br>
N*(X + 0.2*Y) represents, assuming a 20% proc rate, the value of each mastery when repeated N times.  Since N is fixed at one per day for transmuting, transmute mastery can be modeled as X + 0.2*Y profit per day, with X representing the value added by a transmute, while Y is the value of a free product.  Assuming might settles out to the 5g/50g value-add and final price points, transmute mastery is a profit of 15g per day, the mastery representing 10g of it.<br>
<br>
Potion mastery, to take a counter example, has an X of nearly zero, potentially less than zero, while Y is probably in the 1g range.  This gives 0.2*N*Y as the profit margin; 0.2*N being the likely profit on 1g potions, we're looking at making 75 potions a day to match the Might transmute.  This also assumes you actually have a sufficient market to sell the 15 bonus potions.<br>
<br>
I don't see the benefit in taking potion/elixir mastery on more than one or two people in your guild.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Really, probably the best solution is going to be for me to find a spellfire mage and offer to trade one for one, fire for water, spellcloth for shadowcloth.<br>

On the bright side, mana is tremendously easy to farm; I think I was averaging about a primal every 5-10 minutes without even trying hard on those Warp Monstrosities in NS, and rates are good on the Manaseekers/Mageslayers over in Kirinvar too.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>There's probably a whole economics thread just in this derail, but anyway.<br>
<br>
1)  It's interesting to hear that primal earth is in high supply for your server.  I can't get hold of Primal Earth or Primal Fire at all, they are Sir Not Appearing On This AH- the miners must either be keeping what they mine, or have all taken up herbalism or something.  Primal Shadow is currently at giveaway prices and Primal Life not much better, though.  I agree with you that prices for Primals in general will stabilize around 10g, though, and such air/water primals as are showing up seem to be selling around that mark already.<br>
<br>
2)  We're really estimating these costs on the old-world scale.  We all know gold is easier to make now, though... it's hard to predict the inflation.  At least on my servers, Essence of Air and Essence of Life were always a 7-10g kind of propositions (at least up until I took pre-expansion vacation when 2.0 came in), so of course it seems fair to everyone that the new version of Essence of Air is priced at that level... but in a few months, 10g might well seem like chickenfeed.<br>
<br>
A fortune is out there to be made for people who correctly predict their server's inflation and which items will particularly rise in demand and price, and stockpile now accordingly.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_281128"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Life and Shadow are the cheapest because they are the first two to drop for a player as they level up - Motes of Shadow drop a lot in Hellfire Peninsula, and Life drops off quite a few mobs in Zanga Marsh. so the supply on them is much more plentiful, and unlike Earth / Air / Fire / Water / Mana, you actually get a lot of quests that require you to kill the mobs that drop them as well. <br>
<br>
I think in the long run, Primal Shadow will definitely remain the cheapest of them all, purely because more mobs drop it than any other type, and it starts dropping right form the very first zone. <br>
<br>
For comparison, BTW, Earth is on sale in the AH on my server, but Fire is completely missing - not even a single mote up for sale on the Horde side. I think it's due to the vast number of Primal Fires that a mage needs for their Spellfire set.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_281152"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->The basic rule is the same though.<br>
<br>
Profit = (Number of potions made)*(value of potons)*(proc rate)<br>
<br>
Assuming there is a market for that many. <br>
<br>
Primal might transform might be a bit overpriced, Assume the primals settle down to about 20g each for air, earth, fire, water and mana, which is I think realistic, could easly be less.<br>
<br>
For transmutes <br>
Profit = (value of transmuted item)*Proc rate<br>
<br>
Basically means you have to make potions every day with the value of a primal might to make more money.<br>
<br>
The primal might is maybe worth 100g, so you are making at least 50 2g each potions every day.<br>
<br>
The euqation is pretty simple. Look at the final selling price of everything yo make in one day, potions, elixiers or transmutes. Whichever is higher will give you the most money assuming the proc rate is teh same for all specialisations.<br>
<br>
To be honest that has convinced me. Unless you are making potions for the guild transmutation mastery is the way to go. Espeically with the number of herbs available in outland. Right now am not bothering ot pick up a lot. This will possibly change a bit when the raiding starts in ernest again and people are chugging potions like there is no tomorrow.<br>
<br>
Then you look at the gem transmutes, ok they have a 48 hour cooldown, but I can't see me making potions with the same value as a skyfire diamond in 2 days.<br>
<br>
If elixir mastery DOES Proc on flasks then you are looking at something else, as you could potentially be making a lot of expensive potions every day (but to be honest who buys flasks?, unless there are more titanic leggings like recipes coming.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Not to speak of that getting gold is really really easy. I'm rather getting 4 more protection potions than a primal might every few days (don't forget that you need to get mats to transmute too, or sell it, DAILY). With a 16% procc rate like somebody posted earlier you're looking at just a bit more than 1 primal might every week, wow. 10g/day?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Yeah, obviously this would appear to be the standard for which to base things off but things aren't quite what they were. The expansion offers many more avenues for which the casual player can upgrade their gear beyond rares so they don't necessarily have to resort to crafted epics. Additionally, I would wager that the crafting of legendaries contributed in a non-trivial way to the arcanite market and wouldn't necessarily presume that expansion legendaries would require heaps of primal might.<br>
<br>
If there are some means, aside from restarting the trade, to change your specialization, then this isn't nearly as big of deal.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_281195"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I'm still in the air as to what mastery I will go.  I have the elixer quest currently but am transmuting primal mights and attempting to sell them.  If they sell good if not I'll probably just turn them in for the mastery quest.<br>
<br>
The only thing that keeps me going that route is that personally I like using pots/elixers whenever possible and if I proc extras then I consider them throw aways.  By this I mean I can pop one while running around grinding rep or mats.  Where as the transmutes I dnt have much use for them and I  dont think I will.  The prospect of proccing two or more extra X transmutes is exciting because its like instant money.  Even if the going rate for X product is 100g, if I got two or three extra from a proc, you better believe I am selling them for 80g just to get rid of them and grab the gold and run.  But then I think I can only do this once a day and thats assuming I have mats for X transmute.  I guess I could do arcanite bars as a fallback<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Well that's sort of my point, that's exactly why it's not attractive.  My initial impression was that all transmutes were on a separate timer, thus if you do all 4 transmutes in a circle (earth-&gt;water-&gt;air-&gt;fire-&gt;earth), you could basically pop up one free primal per day.<br>
<br>
However, that's not how it works, all the transmutes share the same timer.  Thus, when you're looking at the lolzb-esque fights and need massive greater X protection potions, you're only going to be able to transmute 1 primal per day, so transmute mastery would give you maybe a whopping 2 extra potions per week (via primals).<br>
<br>
Now for a guild with multiple alchemists, then optimum is clearly going to be 1 elixir, 1 potion, and the rest transmute, that's sort of a given.  But if you're a guild that doesn't have multiple alchs, or don't have a 1elixir/1potion person that has the guarenteed playtime that you require (since he'd have to do combines for the entire guild), transmute mastery seems to be by far the worst mastery of the 3.<br>
<br>
p.s.  The primal earth-&gt;water transmute can make some money atm, but the sporeggar grind is stupidly easy, so don't expect that to last.  As someone stated in some thread (might be this one), the hibiscuses in underbog respawn while the mobs don't.  And even if you didn't know that (and I sure didn't), the grind from honored-&gt;revered only took me 7hours.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

If I were master of transmute, and I have to make this elixir, but the elixir guy isn't on, I'll probably just make it myself. Unless you have 3 alchemy alts or 2 other guildies who plays 24/7 and sits in Shatterath all day, I think that's what most of us will do.<br>
<br>
Also, transmute mastery has one more draw back. You transmute, you're done. That's it for 24 hrs. But I can offer my speciality as potions/elixir master to as many people as I want. I can help this dude make some elixirs and another dude making another elixir at the same time. It's not about how much I will make from these transactions, but how much guildies / myself / friends I can help. Even if I do my transmutes for free, it's still once a day.<br>

</div>I have been looking for this myself since Saturday for the mastery quest.  The recipe was sold at Thrallmar/Honor's Hold at various times in Beta but was then removed from the vendors and was never seen again.  I have personally hit up every vendor at every quest that I could think of and I am still missing this recipe.  I am now of the opinion that it is either a world drop or that it has not yet been returned to World of Warcraft.</div>

</div>Sorry, perhaps I need to reword it, as none of the information I'm looking for has been mentioned yet. Also I meant on Live since as we've noticed (dreamless pots / Khorium) things are not always the same from beta -&gt; live.<br>
<br>
I didn't see any of the previous posts mention Potion/Transmute Mastery (other than the ethical conflict of transmuting for others)<br>
<br>
The picture linked earlier shows multiple elixir mastery 'procs'. Have any of the other masteries encountered the same? Before that picture I assumed you would only make one extra (2 for 1). Just curious if it can happen for the others (potion/transmute) I'd guess the potion could proc between 1-4 extra.<br>
<br>
As soon as I start regular transmuting (with mastery) I'm going to keep a record of what I transmute and what I recieve. Maybe in a few weeks I'll have some sort of proc rate for it. <br>
<br>
And anyone seen or heard of the cost (or even posibility) of respecing to another Mastery?</div>

I'm not really looking for what has the chance of letting you discover, just what is possible to discover while making potions and elixirs and the like.<br>
<br>
Also, can you "discover" transmutes?</div>

</div>According to a thread on the WoW Profession Forum, here's an incomplete list:<br>
<br>
Flask of Arcane Fortification (while making Onslaught Elixir, Super Mana Potions)<br>
Flask of Relentless Assault (while making Volatile Healing Potion, Super Healing Potion)<br>
Flask of Mighty Restoration (while making Adept's Elixir, Elixir of Major Agility)<br>
Flask of Fortification (while making Elixir of Mastery, Super Healing Potion, Adept's Elixir)<br>
Flask of Shadow Fortification (while making Elixir of Major Agility)<br>
<br>
From the looks of it most, if not all, of the outlands recipes have a chance of discovering a new flask.  The skill doesn't matter it seems, since some people made the discovery while making orange recipes, while others got it from grey ones.  The number of potions to make to achieve a discovery is greatly varied as well.<br>
<br>
My biggest question is that if I had discovered something while making Adept's Elixir for example, will I be able to obtain another discovery making the same thing or is it a one discovery per known recipe kind of deal?  Also, while there are some overlapping in the data (such as Elixir of Major Agility can discover both Flask of Mighty Restoration and Shadow Fortification), do all potions have an equal chance of discovering a flask or only certain ones can?</div>

		<div id="post_message_277359" class="post_message_underline">Here is what I've discovered so far about certain herbs (I figured it fit here since herbalism and alchemy go hand in hand).<br>
<br>
Mana Thistle: Only grows in Terokkar, Nagrand, Blade's Edge, Netherstorm and Shadowmoon. In addition it can only be found in areas of each map that can only be accessed by flight.<br>
<br>
Netherbloom: Only grows in Netherstorm (seems obvious). In addition it gives a random buff or debuff that gives or takes 50 of a random stat (i.e. +50str or -50sta) for 15 minutes.<br>
<br>
Nightmare Vine: Only grows in Shadowmoon Valley. Haven't picked any yet don't know if there are any effects.<br>
<br>
Terocone: Only grows in Terokkar Forest.<br>
<br>
Dreaming Glory: Only grows in Mountainous/Hilly areas but grows in every zone (Very similar to mountain silversage). Grants a small 30health every 5 seconds buff that last 15 minutes.<br>
<br>
Ancient Lichen: Only grows in Auchenai and Coilfang instances (I think). In addition this CAN be herbed off the bog lords in Zangarmarsh.<br>
<br>
Fel Lotus: Very small chance to be found in ANY of the herbs found in Outland.<br>
<br>
A few questions regarding herbalism for those that might know:<br>
<br>
1) Does Mana Thistle work similarly to Black Lotus (i.e. are there only a few spawns available worldwide at any given point in time)?<br>
<br>
2) Are there any other herbable non-instanced mobs that have a chance to drop Netherbloom, Nightmare Vine or Mana Thistle?<br>
<br>
Since many of these herbs are found only in one zone and are used in a lot of the better recipes I can see serious bottlenecking issues come raid time. Especially on higher pop servers. Many flasks use 10-20 of these zone specific herbs. I'd start mass herb farming now and forget about rep til later if you want to have enough mats to make those flasks.<br>
<br>
Dreamfoil was bad because it was used in almost every good recipe but at least it grew in many, many zones.<br>
<br>
Edit: typos</div>

About the alchemy economy, the is one thing that wonders me : once your are spec (potion/elixir/transmut), you will want to make things. This will probably lead to crafting beeing free. If we take the transmut spec alchemist for exemple : you have your transmut cooldown up, but no mats for transmut. And someone is looking for a primal might transmut. As you have a chance to proc an extra primal might, its in your interest to make the transmut, even for free. And for potion/elixir is even more, since it doesn't use your cooldown and you have a chance to discover another recipe.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I don't see that happening for transmutes.  The 24 hour cooldown limits the supply of transmutes, so barring extremely low demand for transmutes relative to the number of alchemists on a server, there's going to be enough value in a transmute that someone is willing to pay for it.  <br>
<br>
If two strangers ask you to transmute for them, with one offering you 10g, and the other asking you to do it for free - whose offer would you accept?  <br>
<br>
That said, I would not be surprised to see "common" transmute prices go pretty low.  Arcanite transmutes went down to 4g on my server - and that's on a 48 hour cooldown.  Uncommon essence transmutes yielded  5g profits for a long while (using the AH prices of successfully sold goods), but even that went down over time as more alchemists learned the transmute/essence drops became more common.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I think it largely depends on what you have a high stockpile of.   As a miner, I have tons of primal earth.   For me, the most profitable would probably be turning my easily obtained Earth into Water (Revered with Sporeggar).<br>
<br>
Assuming there is a recipe that allows the transmute of Shadow -&gt; Anything that would also be quite profitable and Shadow is currently going for 1 gold or less on my server.<br>

		<div id="post_message_281775"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I never looked at Alchemy as a profit maker, more as a way to make my life easier.  That's how I'll be approaching my choice in regards to which mastery to take.  I don't mind harvesting, but farming for motes/primals as Restoration Shaman is not my idea of fun.  So to support my friend and mine enchanting needs (as well as his Blacksmithing projects), I will be taking up transmute mastery in hopes that it will save us the time and money in the long run.<br>
<br>
Personally, I don't think any of the mastery will be profitable.  Any competent guild will probably have at least one potion and one elixir master who will be crafting for the guild regularly (and now with the raid size of 25, less people to supply consumables to as well).  I don't see anyone paying for the end products if they can possibly walk away with more by using the same amount of materials to make the same number of pots you'd be purchasing.<br>
<br>
I asked this in another forum, and I'm curious as to what people here thinks.  If you are selling your transmute and you happend to make 2, what would you do with the extra one?  Do you keep it, charge the buyer an additional fee, or congratulate him for being lucky?<br>

</div>It's been ruined by retards on my server too.  104g to buy all the mats, 120g sell price.  That's 108g after the 10% AH tax.  So you make 4g a day.  This is just 2 weeks after the xpac.  Two weeks is all it took for people to retard up the auction house.<br>

Primals will not really shine as commodities until people start running heroic's often enough to make primal nether available for crafting epics - just like potions won't shine until the bulk of the population starts raiding.</div>

</div>As a bit of an illustration that skilling up is driving the economy, I bought 20 Super Mana potions at the auction house for a total of 24 gold (2 stacks @ 5 gold, 2 stacks @ 7 gold).   The gold cost of the vials alone is 10.8 gold.   <br>
<br>
The materials for one potion are 2 x Netherbloom and 1 x Felweed.   On my server a stack of Netherbloom (20) is 45-50 gold.  Right now people are paying a fortune to skill up their professions, and off-loading the product for next to nothing.<br>
<br>
I realize there may not be much profit in simply buying all the essences then transmuting them to a Primal Might, but you could easily farm the materials for a primal in an hour or so (could also be supplemented by purchasing the cheaper primals) and make that 100-125 gold.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>This is a primary reason, right now, to be browsing raid consumables.  I have an alt with nearly 300 Super Mana Pots...If you see them for a 1-1.5G a pop, not buying them is well....silly.  I did the same thing with major mana during the Scourge event picking up 5 stacks of major mana for 1-2G.<br>
<br>
Another part of the cheap price is the high deposits.  For some reason Blizzrd thinks that pretty much nearly every thing should cost a 1-2G to list.  Therefore, people NEED to have it sell or risk taking a bath on the lost deposits.  Putting up 5 stacks of super health cost me 7G for a 24 hour listing.  I wouldn't be suprised in a month or so seeing people just "/WTS X" for consumable in order to avoid possible losses.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_282252"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Omelet, potions are also big drops when farming.  I've collected 20 super mana and heal pots easily in 2 days of farming for obviously no cost to me.  And many people are farming - scryer/aldor tokens, motes, etc.  On my server primal mights have dropped to 60g and there are nearly two dozen in the AH now, a LOT of transmute mules I suppose.<br>
<br>
IMO transmutes will always be a low-value business, yes its exciting to suddenly make 10, 20, 40g for almost no work but do realize you can farm this in just a few minutes now in outlands.  People need to let go of the mentality of hoarding gold, unless you are in an extremely hardcore raiding guild your repair costs per day are going to be fairly negligable, and the potential to earn money just killing stuff or running easy 5 mans is very big.  Its really best to focus on professions that either are pure cash cows (herb/alchemy/skinning) in case you want to build some sort of 20k gold stockpile for a bizarre reason, or work on professions that help your gameplay and are fun.  Enchanting, tailoring, alchemy, jewelcrafting, blacksmithing all fit this.  Hopefully with prof revamps engineering and leatherworking will also fit in.<br>
<br>
The biggest mistake most people made in the 60-70 rush is doing quests from 66 on.  I instanced only from 66-70 and did all my quests at 70 - took exactly 2 days of casual play for me to raise the 3000g I needed to buy my swift mount from just turning in quests.  Now gold is a joke, I have over 2000g and not much to spend it on.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_285411" class="post_message_underline">IMO once you see more and more people get their swift flying mounts (they are not epic dammit I wish people would stop calling it that) you will see the market for primal mights surge.  Simple reason - many, many very nice tailoring and blacksmithing recipes use primal mights.  Once you have your swift mount and ok gear there is little to spend money on, so the 100g or so a day you can farm in an hour you can put towards new epic gear.<br>
<br>
Right now that market is a bit dead, as the people who can afford it don't want it as they are raiding for equivalent gear.  In 2-3 months however as more and more casuals hit 70 and get their swift mount, that market will imo explode.  Especially as the high end raiding guilds have tailors/BS's that can make pretty much everything and have massive primal nethers banked.  Those tailors can easily buy a dozen mights on the AH, make a battlerobe and turn around and sell it for a 100% markup.  I forsee this as the way guilds fund raid materials, as escorting people into Vashj/TK for drops is unlikely for a long time.</div>

They have lots of statistics about potion crafting and if they see like 5k of potions made each day, they can just adjust the discovery change accordingly. Or give a rule like "1 certain discovery during frist 10k potions made this week" or even more complicated "1 certain discovery for each &lt;number of potions created last week&gt; attempts this week" or something like that?<br>
<br>
I'm ofc just guessing here, but it would allow blizz to control the number of rare recipes very accurately. The main point here is that we have very little means of actually learning anything about alchemy discoveries by just sending random facts like "I made 2 discoveries in 1 day" "I've yet to get my frist discovery and i've still created over (n+1) potions"...</div>

		<div id="post_message_285725" class="post_message_underline">Remember discoveries have to be spaced over time and this needs to be done by a very finely tuned percentage of discovery per potion you make. If that percent was ever over 1, you would discover all of the recipes within a week of determind combines. As it is, I think the percent must be closer to 0.5% per, which allows for such spectacularly bad luck sometimes. Alchemy is a fast farming, fast creating profession. You make a ton of stuff really quick when you put your mind to it. <br>
Hence, the chances of that rare discovery are low, and exciting.</div>

The reasons why I don't believe in constant discovery percentages are stated in your post. It'd have to be very carefully adjusted, and still people could force recipes by farming enough materials, and I don't think that is what they are after with this kind of mechanic.</div>

The worst part is elixir procs flasks, but potions doesn't, yet you have to get lucky and discover things in order to make them.  I personally think all masteries should proc flasks.  I've made this post on the Profession Forums.  Please bump it so we can get the already horrible discovery system slightly fixed.<br>

</div>Several holes in that theroy.  One pots have no cooldowns.  You can't go to your buddy and get him to crank out 15 primal mights in a couple of minutes.  Second there is no value to transmuting other then the primal that comes out then end.  Pots can and are made to level Alchemy and there is always someone out there leveling alchemy for one of their toons, transmutes because of their cooldowns are not used for leveling alchemy near as much as pots.

</div>It's true that transmutes have a cooldown and that limis the supply, but supply is only one blade of the scissors that determines prices.  My point about the value of mats vs. final products still stands.  Many of us have already seen Might sell for equal or less than its constituent parts on the open market.  That doesn't mean that none will get made, it just means that they will be made on-demand as potions and elixirs were and are, and you will have to sell your services like an enchanter thus further reducing profits by the value of your time.<br>
<br>
It's also worth noting that on transmute mastery effectively increases the supply (technical economics definition) of transmuted goods, thus lowering their price.  Similar to how I'll trade +dmg for crit if it balances out to an increase in average damage, I could sell Might for what looks like a losing price if the expected profit is still positive.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>At 67, before reaching the Naga, I can safely hit 11 nodes of Hibiscus and around 8 possible nodes of Ancient Lichen (there's one of each that is impossible without clearing the mobs, and one that is iffy depending on what type of mob is closest, with underbat having a slightly smaller aggro range).  If I'm feeling adventurous, I would take the trouble and risk to get through the stealth-detection Sentries and farm the rest of the instance (which would yield at least 4 more Hibiscus and 1-3 possible nodes of Ancient Lichen).<br>
<br>
My rogue is also a miner, so I often get 1-2 nodes of Adamantite (Rich if I'm lucky), and I can pick 2 of the 3 chest spawn locations for even more booty.  Underbog is a farming heaven compared to grinding mobs for money.<br>
<br>
Got 3 Primal Mights last night in my first transmute attempt after obtaining mastery.  If I was only this lucky with the discoveries.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">At 67, before reaching the Naga, I can safely hit 11 nodes of Hibiscus and around 8 possible nodes of Ancient Lichen (there's one of each that is impossible without clearing the mobs, and one that is iffy depending on what type of mob is closest, with underbat having a slightly smaller aggro range).  If I'm feeling adventurous, I would take the trouble and risk to get through the stealth-detection Sentries and farm the rest of the instance (which would yield at least 4 more Hibiscus and 1-3 possible nodes of Ancient Lichen).<br>
<br>
My rogue is also a miner, so I often get 1-2 nodes of Adamantite (Rich if I'm lucky), and I can pick 2 of the 3 chest spawn locations for even more booty.  Underbog is a farming heaven compared to grinding mobs for money.<br>

Got 3 Primal Mights last night in my first transmute attempt after obtaining mastery.  If I was only this lucky with the discoveries.</div>

When you hit 70 you should be able to clear that 3 pack to get to the 3rd chest.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>The latter.  There are around 8 <i>possible</i> spawn points that I can get to safely.  No way I'm lucky enough to have all of them up at the same time, and unlike Hibiscus, which according to my theory is that at any given time there are only a certain number of them up at once, and when you picked one, it will immediately spawn at another spot that hasn't been farmed yet.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>If you took the time to read the post, you'd see that I was responding to a potion master who also proc'd the major agility elixir... meaning both masteries proc it and that it's probably a different sort of bug that causes the wrong mastery to proc, rather than a simple misslabeling.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>A practical tangent to your post are my impressions of the Trinket itself.<br>
<br>
1. If you went alchemy for the Trinket <i>alone</i> or almost exclusively, be prepared for a slight disappointment.<br>
<br>
2. However, in and of itself it is the best trinket hands-down for Shamans and Druids who aim to diversify their roles (as discussed eariler on these very forums), in both PvP and PvE it is amazing to get healed for 3500 from a healthstone, or crit a super mana pot for almost your entire mana pool (unbuffed in my case, 7700). However:<br>
<br>
3. In being all-purpose, the Alchemist's Stone<i>does</i> lose out in specific comparision to the mana gained over time from say Bangle of Endless Blessings. <br>
<br>
4. Thankfully, the mats are fairly easy, but even so I look at the mats for a Planar Edge and cry a little, since clearly my trinket does not really compare to a perpetually upgradable weapon which starts with such high DPS.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<!-- message -->
		<div id="post_message_290744"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->To continue your tangent, while I would agree that the Alchemist's Stone is not an all-purpose trinket, I would say that on any fight where you need to chain-potion to keep your mana pool healthy, or even any fight where you potion once or twice, this trinket is hands-down the absolute best thing you can get as a healer.<br>
<br>
For example, look at Fel Mana potion.  It is a guaranteed 3200 mana return (assuming you don't top off on mana before all ticks expire).  Fel mana potion, if used every 2 minutes equates to 133.5 mp/5.<br>
<br>
This trinket turns that into a guaranteed return of 4480 mana (560 per tick instead of 400), which is a 53.3 mp/5 improvement in mana return via potion. With the trinket equipped, you are looking at 186.6 mp/5 if potting every 2 minutes.  You won't find anything close to this from any other trinkets.  <br>
<br>
For Super Mana Potions, the 'mean' return is 2400 per pot (100 mp/5), or 3360 (140 mp/5) with the stone.  40 mp/5 difference with the stone on, if taking Super Mana potions every two minutes.<br>
<br>
And thats without even mentioning the benefits you may see from the static 15 stam, 15 intellect, and 15 spirit.<br>
<br>
And the mats are easy, plus its a one-time investment.  I love it.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_294917"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->My apologies if this has been discussed before but it's not likely I could read through 35 pages and hit the mark anyway.  I just had my first discovery today, I learned Primal Mana to Primal Fire and it hit off of a might transmute.  Here's a screenshot: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081109235855/http://chuckg.org/dump/2007/primal_discovery.jpg" target="_blank">http://chuckg.org/dump/2007/primal_discovery.jpg</a><br>
<br>
I'm currently (stuck and miserable) as a transmute mastery spec and have been trying for a discovery going on 3 weeks now.  I've combined over 1000 potions in that time (yea I counted) in my attempt to actually learn something and it comes as a surprise and a shock that I learned a transmute.  But a question comes to mind; am I only allowed to learn transmute's as a transmute master? Taking it a step further, am I only allowed to discover transmutes by transmuting? They're pretty worthless considering it only takes 10 minutes tops to farm a primal of any type, give or take some luck and although I'm excited to have finally discovered something, disappoint is seeping it's way in.<br>
<br>
Can anyone shed some light on this?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">My apologies if this has been discussed before but it's not likely I could read through 35 pages and hit the mark anyway.  I just had my first discovery today, I learned Primal Mana to Primal Fire and it hit off of a might transmute.  Here's a screenshot: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081109235855/http://chuckg.org/dump/2007/primal_discovery.jpg" target="_blank">http://chuckg.org/dump/2007/primal_discovery.jpg</a><br>
<br>
I'm currently (stuck and miserable) as a transmute mastery spec and have been trying for a discovery going on 3 weeks now.  I've combined over 1000 potions in that time (yea I counted) in my attempt to actually learn something and it comes as a surprise and a shock that I learned a transmute.  But a question comes to mind; am I only allowed to learn transmute's as a transmute master? Taking it a step further, am I only allowed to discover transmutes by transmuting? They're pretty worthless considering it only takes 10 minutes tops to farm a primal of any type, give or take some luck and although I'm excited to have finally discovered something, disappoint is seeping it's way in.<br>
<br>
Can anyone shed some light on this?</div>

	</tbody></table>
</div>Mastery has no bearing on what you discover as far as we can tell.<br>
<br>
Transmutes only will discover other transmutes. Everything else discovers the flasks and the one or two potions which are discovered. I can only presume that transmutes have a much higher chance to be discovered, but since you can only transmute once per day you can't power through it.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">To continue your tangent, while I would agree that the Alchemist's Stone is not an all-purpose trinket, I would say that on any fight where you need to chain-potion to keep your mana pool healthy, or even any fight where you potion once or twice, this trinket is hands-down the absolute best thing you can get as a healer.<br>
<br>
For example, look at Fel Mana potion.  It is a guaranteed 3200 mana return (assuming you don't top off on mana before all ticks expire).  Fel mana potion, if used every 2 minutes equates to 133.5 mp/5.<br>
<br>
This trinket turns that into a guaranteed return of 4480 mana (560 per tick instead of 400), which is a 53.3 mp/5 improvement in mana return via potion. With the trinket equipped, you are looking at 186.6 mp/5 if potting every 2 minutes.  You won't find anything close to this from any other trinkets.  <br>
<br>
For Super Mana Potions, the 'mean' return is 2400 per pot (100 mp/5), or 3360 (140 mp/5) with the stone.  40 mp/5 difference with the stone on, if taking Super Mana potions every two minutes.<br>
<br>
And thats without even mentioning the benefits you may see from the static 15 stam, 15 intellect, and 15 spirit.<br>
<br>
And the mats are easy, plus its a one-time investment.  I love it.</div>

</div>Gotta second this post. Alchemist Stone is THE BEST trinket for a healer right now, and it would take a hell of a trinket to top it. No others even come close. Now if only I get myself a Bangle of Infinite Blessings to go along with it...<br>
<br>
My only issue with it is that it seems to not work with Dreamless Sleep potions. I've only tested the highest level Dreamless Sleep so I don't know if its universal. I'm pretty sure this is a bug, I don't see why it wouldn't work with them.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_296507"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Transmute mastery is definitely not the choice if you aren't a patient person.   Over the course of many transmutes (100+) you will begin to get closer to the expected yield.<br>
<br>
Even then, since randomness can often have streaks, you may be above or below the expected amount.   The exact same thing happens with Potions and Elixirs.  I've had someone make me 20 potions without a single proc.   The difference is, you can just make 20 more potions right away and you will completely forget about your bad run earlier.  When you are doing one transmute every 1/2 days, you tend to remember those bad streaks.<br>
<br>
For every person that hasn't had a proc, there is a person who's had 50% procs.  It will all balance out in the long run.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>
