		<div id="post_message_367797">I was just wondering what high-end raiding guilds/dps warriors think of the current situation with dps warriors. As it is now we output quite decent dps, nothing groundbreaking, nothing negligible. I'm just wondering how much our damage will go up with the higher level gear. <br>
<br>
Pre-TBC we scaled insanely well with gear upgrades due to the fact that better gear gave us better rage generation. As it is now however, rage generation is far from our worst problem with dps. When I raid as fury, I'm always put in a group with an enhancement shaman and three rogues. I bring battle shout, shaman brings windfury and strength of earth. Knowing this, windfury adds a lot to my rage generation, but it's currently at the point where I have trouble getting rid of all my rage in a threat-efficient way. I've taken to keeping Piercing Howl up as a debuff on the mobs/bosses in order to up the tank's threat, and to up my dps a tiny bit. Even with Heroic Strike/Cleave spam, there are times where it's a struggle to keep my rage under 100 (so as not to waste potential from a full rage bar + white hit generating no rage).<br>
<br>
Basically my question is: what do you see as a future for dps warriors, considering our once limiting factor (rage generation) has all but been removed, and our new limiting factor is putting our rage to more damage per rage point?<br>
<br>
The only stats I can see that help this are attack power and crit, and I suppose the newly added armor penetration on Tier 6. Are we going to see dps warriors stacking 8/10 strength and 8/10 crit gems and ignoring +hit? Is there really a future at all for dps warriors considering the difficulty in increasing damage per rage we can do?</div>

		<div id="post_message_367804">Warriors are the most gear dependent class and as gear continues to improve, so will the dps an Arms or Fury warrior will bring to the table.<br>
<br>
There are always was to dump rage without the extra threat from Heroic Strike: imp cleave, imp slam come to mind. <br>
<br>
A little confused by what you mean by spamming Piercing Howl. I was under the impression that it didn't count as a true Daze and didn't add on HS damage (Blizz tweaking it as not to make it too OP for BGs).<br>
<br>
There's also imp thunderclap and demo shout to use, both of which will help a MT out more than PH will. <br>
<br>
And if PvE-specced and rage isn't a problem nor is keeping Flurry up, I'd consider a slower, harder-hitting OH if you have a fast one now. <br>
<br>
I do find it interesting that much of the dps plate gear seen from BT seem to have +haste to it. <br>
<br>
Anyway, I think there will be always a spot for a savvy dps warrior in a raid, one who can take on multiple roles, be it off-tanking, debuff bitch or damage dealer.</div>

		<div id="post_message_368035">I agree we've always been the most gear dependant class, but in the past the gear dependancy came from our inability to generate enough rage without the gear. Now we can generate more than enough rage, with gear from Gruul's Lair, Karazhan and Heroics. I'm just wondering how our gear dependancy will continue when we wont benefit much from the increase in rage generation since in some cases we already have more than we can safely use. <br>
<br>
Global cooldown limits the use of Slam, threat limits the use of Cleave and Heroic Strike. In my opinion, our limitation now isn't the rage we need to do damage, but the damage we can do with the rage we have.<br>
<br>
As for Piercing Howl counting as a daze effect for Heroic Strike added damage, I'm fairly sure it counts as the daze. Bosses that are immune to the slow effect still get the debuff that says "Dazed." I've also noticed that when I was tanking and someone was keeping Piercing Howl up, my tps was in general 30-50 higher than without (this was at Gruul, so rage wasn't a limiting factor). However that could be just a "feeling" and not really hard evidence.</div>

		<div id="post_message_368095">I have a question regarding the ideal gearing up of a Fury warrior.  I have a druid I played as my main, opting to reroll for the expansion as a Belf pally.  Both of which did quite a bit of tanking.  I've decided though that I wish I had intially re-rolled as a warrior.  So I've done that and of course fell in love with DPS over tanking.  <br>
<br>
Anyways... My warrior is Specced 0/46/15 for Dps and OTing when needed.  I just hit 70 last week and have been actively trying to gear him up, which I've done a decent job of so far.  I understand the importance of hit, while also maintaing an appropriate mixture of AP and crit.<br>
<br>
My main problem is trying to theory craft what is the best possible weapon selection.  I've noticed a lot of the warriors use a Slow hard hitting mainhand with a quick offhand.  I can contribute this to the relatively ease with which one can acquire the arena offhand.<br>
<br>
However, I've heard multiple comments saying that a slow offhand is really quite good for both rage generation and dps.  Up till this point i've merely needed to take the higher dps weapon as an upgrade.  <br>
<br>
So my question is this:  In a raid setting for DPSing, what is the ideal style of dual wielding?  A Slow mainhand with a fast offhand, a slow mainhand with and offhand,a fast mainhand with a slow offhand, or A fast mainhand and offhand?  (Assuming equivalent dps for each so that it can be pure theory)<br>
<br>
Thank you very much in advance.</div>

		<div id="post_message_368105">I think as long as Warriors are getting "meaningful" DPS stat upgrades on gear it will get better.  The main problem is that the items have to drop first, which means it will take a while longer for a Warrior to catch up to the "real DPS classes" (I hate that term) depending on how lucky you are.  I think most of our damage though, after "rage is no longer a factor" will obviously have to come from bigger BT's and better white damage through haste and AP. <br>
<br>
And now that haste is being nerfed, it essentially becomes a sidegrade stat to AP and crit, and is no longer "the" stat to focus on.</div>

My question is, are you starting to feel the Threat limiting your damage output ceiling sooner than expected? As in, coming faster than gear upgrades. In an extreme case, would you be up to the point where just auto attacking and doing Heroic Strike when you can be all you can afford to do without pulling aggro?</div>

</div>If all I used were global cooldowns and auto attack, threat would be fine.  It doesn't seem to grossly scale right now.  The main issue with me at least is that I would be sitting at over 50 rage full time even after all of the globals if I did not toss in a cleave or Heroic every now and again.  That is also upping my DPS slightly, but it's also what seems to be the biggest issue with threat right now.  I also do not understand your question.  Why would a Warrior just auto attack and use the single highest threat DPS ability?  Doing just Heroics is really bad. Doing them over something like BT and WW is even worse.  If you are just hypothetically asking if I could spam Heroic, (without using any other abilities) without pulling aggro, then the answer is no.</div>

</div>This is the problem I was referring to, we have the rage we need to do damage (in some cases more than enough) but the problem lies in our ability to either output that damage in a threat efficient way, or to output enough damage to equal the other classes.<br>
<br>
As for the question about only auto-attack and Heroic Strike, no that scenario would not come up. Firstly because Heroic Strike is a high-threat ability, and really not all that great for dps. It could potentially come to the point where all you can do is Bloodthirst/Whirlwind on the cooldowns and auto attack. There have been some trash pulls and threat sensitive boss fights where I've been limited to using only Bloodthirst, or only auto-attack. There were even a couple cases where I had to turn off my auto-attack for a period of time due to threat.<br>
<br>
In general though, I don't see threat as our major issue anymore. Blessing of Salvation is, for now, enough to deal with the threat we generate from our dps. My original post and it's question is asking whether other warriors see a future in the "dps warrior." Simply because I don't see our gear scaling in proportion to other classes anymore.<br>
<br>
Like I've said previously, the gear upgrades we got pre-TBC increased our dps substantially because they gave us the rage to dps. Now we already HAVE the rage we need to dps, we just can't put it to good enough use.<br>
<br>
As for the question about weapon speeds, a faster offhand benefits you more from a rage generation point of view. As you find yourself with more than enough rage however, you might want to consider swapping out a fast offhand for a slower, harder hitting one. Not that it really makes much difference in terms of the dps you'll output, it just wont feel so bad in terms of rage that you can't use. :P</div>

</div>This is what I've found to be true.  When I have an enhancement shaman, I'm running at about 3500ap, 30% crit, and 16.5% hit.  However, once Bloodthirst and Whirlwind are on cooldown, I don't really have anything to do.  I'm constantly maxed out on rage, spamming heroic strike as fast as I can so I don't feel like I'm wasting rage generation while capped at 100.<br>
<br>
Threat isn't as much an issue for me, as I have the fankriss trinket and use it during deathwish at engage, providing a nice buffer for the MT.</div>

		<div id="post_message_368475">I've been wondering about exactly that problem, the heroic strike threat vs damage issue, that we even now, as dual wield dps warriors, runs into.<br>
<br>
So, what can we, with the way the warrior mechanics currently works, do?<br>
<br>
Right now i'm playing around with 2-hand fury, which actually seems to have alot of potential, and before you go "dual wield or MS" on me like the typical 2 hand arms warrior.<br>
<br>
What i'm currently playing around with is basically to try to apply the basics of how hunters dps' to a warrior mechanics, centered around the use of improved slam.<br>
<br>
Improved slam is one awesome skill, not AP normalised, and when timed perfectly, you get a full non normalised attack, affected by impale, capable of proc'ing windfury (with a 2hander), for 0.5 seconds of lost auto attack time, if you apply it directly after a white attack.<br>
 <br>
Applying a slam after each auto attack is the basics of what i try to do currently, then apply a special afterwards, and wait those 0.3 seconds for the next white attack.<br>
<br>
This also gives you an allmost 99% flurry uptime, as you basically have 2 special attacks for each white attack, all of those capable of proc'ing flurry, which means that the calculation for flurry would start to say 100% - the chance that i haven't landed a crit the last 8 attacks.<br>
<br>
assuming a 100% flurry uptime, this gives the 2 hand fury warrior, with a speed 3.7 weapon, an attack cycle looking like:<br>
<br>
<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px">
	<div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom:0px"><img src="/web/20080302201527im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/chestnut/misc/code_html.gif" border="0"></div>
	<pre class="alt2" dir="ltr" style="
		margin: 0px;
		padding: 3px;
		border: 1px inset;
		width: 694px;
		height: 50px;
		text-align: left;
		overflow: auto">Auto - Slam -  BT  - Auto - Slam -  WW  - Auto - Slam -  BT  - Auto - Slam ....
 0.0   0.5     1.5    3.46   3.96   4.96   6.92   7.42   7.92   9.88   10.38 ...</pre>
</div>You lose some BT damage here, as there'll be (if you add a bit of lag) 7 seconds or so between the BT's, there's also the issue of WW only being applied roughly each 14 seconds, due to the cooldown not being up when the next "time to apply a non BT speciel" comes up, this gives time to apply shouts + rampage though, so not exactly wasted dps time.<br>
<br>
A sidenote here, is that this build benefits greatly from an additional haste effect, a dragonspine trophy proc for example, would put the auto attack timer at 2.38, which with the 0.5 sec slam cast time, would give you a close to optimal 3 second cycle, with auto - slam - special - ready for next auto attack.<br>
<br>
Lets try to look at the differences between 2 hand fury and dual wield fury again:<br>
<br>
Dual wield gets:<br>
<br>
Roughly 20% more white damage (was what playing around with the spreadsheet gave me)<br>
A higher and more steady rage income (which is close to a non issue, as our ragegain in a raid enviroment is high)<br>
the ability to apply a weapon buff to your offhand<br>
<br>
Two hand fury gets:<br>
<br>
A higher flurry uptime<br>
Benefits more from windfury, as the build will be landing roughly as many mainhand + special attacks as the dual wield fury build, while proc'ing a big fat 2 hander hit, instead of a one hander attack.<br>
A pure damage to threat ratio, without HS adding additional threat.<br>
The bonus from 3/5 two hander specialisation, which you can get without missing any important PvE dps talents<br>
A higher percentage of damage comming from specials, thus making impale a better dps talent.<br>
No low offhand crit's canceling one's deep wound effect, thus making deep wound actually tick for ok ammounts relatively often.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
In a lagfree enviroment, this seems like two hand fury is more than capable of doing equal damage to a dual wield fury build, but if you take lag and human errors into equation, it becomes way more even.<br>
<br>
I've just started to play around with two hand fury, but it seems viable, i'm still cancelling some of my auto attacks due to making mistakes with slam and such, and still i'm close to the level of dps i had while dualwielding before. <br>
<br>
Aside from all this, it's also fun, at least to me, to try out something new, and this actually demands more from the warrior than just spamming skills, it requires some ammount of timing and adapting to haste proc's and such, thus making it more fun to play, at least for me.<br>
<br>
I sadly cannot find a dps spreadsheet taking these things into account, and since Excel hates me, the one i worked on myself, seems to have been corrupted, yay. But, if any of you could run this theory through a spreadsheet, it would be nice to see, even though i probably will be proved wrong in saying that 2 hand fury have as much a potential for dps as dual wield, without as much threat.</div>

</div>What spec do you use? I haven't tried a pure 2hand fury build but I do like imp slam on a 33-28 or 31-30 build (cookie cutter, yes, but also effective).<br>
<br>
Pre-xpac, I was 2hand Fury for quite a long using Ashkandi. Come xpac, I leveled up as DW fury with points in Prot for instances.<br>
<br>
Now, I've tried DW and 2hand builds, and I'm enjoying using a 2hander (Mooncleaver) when I'm not specced Protection.<br>
<br>
The main reasons I've gone with the cookie cutter build are <br>
<br>
a) I tend to get lots of Overpowers and hate losing rage switching stances.<br>
b) In battle stance, I can keep imp Thunderclap up on the MT's target, offering some additional benefits besides shouts.<br>
c) With Blood Frenzy, I can do the same for other melee folks.<br>
<br>
I do keep imp Slam (I feel naked without it these days) and however many points I can in Flurry.<br>
<br>
This build gives the same functionality as 2hand fury, offers some extra benefits and still puts out a large degree of damage.<br>
<br>
For cycles, if I can get a charge in, I usually open with a Slam (IceHud casting bar helps with the timing), thunderclap, Heroic Strike, Mortal Strike, switch to zerker, slam again, Whirlwind (if no CC'd mobs around, HS-MS.<br>
<br>
If a mob is near 30% hp, I'll do a couple of slams and it's usually time for execute by then.<br>
<br>
Oh, and I have Mongoose on my axe and already have good crit and attack power the extra haste helps and can be boosted even more by my Abacus of Violent Odds.<br>
<br>
So, it seems as the mechanics and cycles are very similar, just wondering how Bloodthirst compares as a special against Mortal Strike at that point.</div>

Bosses that are immune to the slow effect still get the debuff that says "Dazed." I've also noticed that when I was tanking and someone was keeping Piercing Howl up, my tps was in general 30-50 higher than without (this was at Gruul, so rage wasn't a limiting factor). However that could be just a "feeling" and not really hard evidence.</div>

</div>2h Fury is great, I'm just not sure how big of a difference it is though going at least 41 into Fury compared to just going 31/30.  You lose 5% crit and 5% damage with 2h weapons (2% in your case) for an additional 250 + 10% AP.  The main thing I noticed from it was that Flurry was not up quite as much, but Slams were higher in damage.  BT was also higher than MS fully raid buffed.</div>

		<div id="post_message_368882">Funny, I was just looking for a thread about 2H warrior slam DPS. When I was leveling up my DW gear became pretty bad around 69. So I picked up a Crystalforged War Axe and tried a 2H slam build with axe spec. I was very impressed, but only stayed with that build for a week before going prot for tanking.<br>
<br>
Fast forward to this weekend. I decided to have some fun with a Gorehowl, and went for a 31/30 build. I picked up both PvP and PvE talents. So I'm not optimized for one or the other. I had a discussion with some people about warrior slam DPS and came to the conclusion very similar to what Gronx said. On the one Gruul run I went on I was pleasantly surprised how well I did. What I would really like to see is if someone could make a DPS spreadsheet to plug some numbers in. I've tried, and fail horribly in making one myself.<br>
<br>
This biggest perk to me for this build was it seems to take a fair amount of skill/timing to maximize it. It seems like a fun challenge. It also has the fun side effect of being a very good PvP build. IMO slam can do amazing things in PvP. I’ve just scraped the surface of what it can do.<br>
<br>
I also found a mod by mistake that helps out with slam. It's called Quarts, and it is a timer bar mod. It adds a swing timer bar, so you can see when your next swing is going to happen. Helped me a lot with timing my slams.<br>
<br>
Edit: Yeah "Quartz" not "Quarts" <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302201527im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":)" class="inlineimg"></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">My main problem is trying to theory craft what is the best possible weapon selection.  I've noticed a lot of the warriors use a Slow hard hitting mainhand with a quick offhand.  I can contribute this to the relatively ease with which one can acquire the arena offhand.<br>
<br>
However, I've heard multiple comments saying that a slow offhand is really quite good for both rage generation and dps.  Up till this point i've merely needed to take the higher dps weapon as an upgrade.  <br>
<br>
So my question is this:  In a raid setting for DPSing, what is the ideal style of dual wielding?  A Slow mainhand with a fast offhand, a slow mainhand with and offhand,a fast mainhand with a slow offhand, or A fast mainhand and offhand?  (Assuming equivalent dps for each so that it can be pure theory)</div>

	</table>
</div>I don't primarily play a warrior, but I can relay this explanation from one of the best warriors I've ever raided with:<br>
<br>
Dual wielding you want a fast mainhand and a slow offhand to minimize the number of flurry charges consumed by the lower damage offhand (only 62.5%).<br>
<br>
Of course, that's assuming you can't get 100% flurry uptime.  I didn't ask how the math changes when your crit is sufficiently high.</div>

Until I saw this thread, I hadn't seen much information out there on builds for it. &gt;_&gt;<br>
I do want to try a DW build eventually, but to be honest spaming Heroic Strike kinda frightens me. <br>
<br>
Slam-&gt;BT-&gt;Slam-&gt;WW does seem like the best rotation.<br>
<br>
One thing that I've noticed, and kinda bugs me about 20/41 is that it's extremely difficult to keep up rampage with this build. If I try, I CAN keep it up, but it takes alot of effort on my end and can distract me from my rotation, and far too often do I find I get critless streaks during the last 10 seconds rampage is up, making it so I can't refresh it even if I want too. <br>
<br>
Side Note: Having the Lionheart Champion definately helps out because it constantly procs over long fights for an extra 200AP.</div>

But it also seems everyone forgets about +4 weapon skill, not huge, but still some DPS.<br>

Personally, when I'm DPS I'm always 33/28 with imp TC and Demo so that I'm adding more to the raid than just my personal DPS.  That and Rampage is a PIA to keep up without axe spec.<br>

When I solo I like to cast Battle Shout after I get Flurry, just to see how long I can keep Flurry up.  40s is common, but my longest is 105s.  In a raid scenario with more rage, it's damn well near 100%.</div>

				</div>
				<div style="font-style:italic">I've been wondering about exactly that problem, the heroic strike threat vs damage issue, that we even now, as dual wield dps warriors, runs into.<br>
<br>
So, what can we, with the way the warrior mechanics currently works, do?<br>
<br>
Right now i'm playing around with 2-hand fury, which actually seems to have alot of potential, and before you go "dual wield or MS" on me like the typical 2 hand arms warrior.<br>
<br>
What i'm currently playing around with is basically to try to apply the basics of how hunters dps' to a warrior mechanics, centered around the use of improved slam.<br>
<br>
Improved slam is one awesome skill, not AP normalised, and when timed perfectly, you get a full non normalised attack, affected by impale, capable of proc'ing windfury (with a 2hander), for 0.5 seconds of lost auto attack time, if you apply it directly after a white attack.<br>
 <br>
Applying a slam after each auto attack is the basics of what i try to do currently, then apply a special afterwards, and wait those 0.3 seconds for the next white attack.<br>
<br>
This also gives you an allmost 99% flurry uptime, as you basically have 2 special attacks for each white attack, all of those capable of proc'ing flurry, which means that the calculation for flurry would start to say 100% - the chance that i haven't landed a crit the last 8 attacks.<br>
<br>
assuming a 100% flurry uptime, this gives the 2 hand fury warrior, with a speed 3.7 weapon, an attack cycle looking like:<br>
<br>
<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px">
	<div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom:0px"><img src="/web/20080304234658im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/chestnut/misc/code_html.gif" border="0"></div>
	<pre class="alt2" dir="ltr" style="
		margin: 0px;
		padding: 3px;
		border: 1px inset;
		width: 694px;
		height: 50px;
		text-align: left;
		overflow: auto">Auto - Slam -  BT  - Auto - Slam -  WW  - Auto - Slam -  BT  - Auto - Slam ....
 0.0   0.5     1.5    3.46   3.96   4.96   6.92   7.42   7.92   9.88   10.38 ...</pre>
</div>You lose some BT damage here, as there'll be (if you add a bit of lag) 7 seconds or so between the BT's, there's also the issue of WW only being applied roughly each 14 seconds, due to the cooldown not being up when the next "time to apply a non BT speciel" comes up, this gives time to apply shouts + rampage though, so not exactly wasted dps time.<br>
<br>
A sidenote here, is that this build benefits greatly from an additional haste effect, a dragonspine trophy proc for example, would put the auto attack timer at 2.38, which with the 0.5 sec slam cast time, would give you a close to optimal 3 second cycle, with auto - slam - special - ready for next auto attack.<br>
<br>
Lets try to look at the differences between 2 hand fury and dual wield fury again:<br>
<br>
Dual wield gets:<br>
<br>
Roughly 20% more white damage (was what playing around with the spreadsheet gave me)<br>
A higher and more steady rage income (which is close to a non issue, as our ragegain in a raid enviroment is high)<br>
the ability to apply a weapon buff to your offhand<br>
<br>
Two hand fury gets:<br>
<br>
A higher flurry uptime<br>
Benefits more from windfury, as the build will be landing roughly as many mainhand + special attacks as the dual wield fury build, while proc'ing a big fat 2 hander hit, instead of a one hander attack.<br>
A pure damage to threat ratio, without HS adding additional threat.<br>
The bonus from 3/5 two hander specialisation, which you can get without missing any important PvE dps talents<br>
A higher percentage of damage comming from specials, thus making impale a better dps talent.<br>
No low offhand crit's canceling one's deep wound effect, thus making deep wound actually tick for ok ammounts relatively often.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
In a lagfree enviroment, this seems like two hand fury is more than capable of doing equal damage to a dual wield fury build, but if you take lag and human errors into equation, it becomes way more even.<br>
<br>
I've just started to play around with two hand fury, but it seems viable, i'm still cancelling some of my auto attacks due to making mistakes with slam and such, and still i'm close to the level of dps i had while dualwielding before. <br>
<br>
Aside from all this, it's also fun, at least to me, to try out something new, and this actually demands more from the warrior than just spamming skills, it requires some ammount of timing and adapting to haste proc's and such, thus making it more fun to play, at least for me.<br>
<br>
I sadly cannot find a dps spreadsheet taking these things into account, and since Excel hates me, the one i worked on myself, seems to have been corrupted, yay. But, if any of you could run this theory through a spreadsheet, it would be nice to see, even though i probably will be proved wrong in saying that 2 hand fury have as much a potential for dps as dual wield, without as much threat.</div>

</div>You probably also think that priests can't dps, Fury warriors can't pvp and druids are only meant for off-healing.<br>
<br>
Anyways, a properly geared DW Fury warrior with enough crit for perma-flurry, enough attack power to make bloodthirsts do any damage AND enough hit to avoid strings of misses will likely do more damage on a single target mob.<br>
<br>
But on mutiple mobs/packs, or a target that bleeds a MS or 2hand Fury warrior will shine. Also, Blood Frenzy helps the entire party on bleedable mobs. Ask a feral druid or a rogue if they'd rather be grouped with a MS warrior with Blood Frenzy or a DW Fury one.<br>
<br>
Also, I find that a 2hand warrior will likely be more inclined to offer other benefits for a raid, demo shout, PH, imp thunderclap then a DWer focusing on maximizing their DPS cycles, but your mileage may vary on that.<br>
<br>
And you say that you enjoyed DW; well, many people enjoy swinging a big ole weapon around. And the damage can be done with a imp Slam build. With Flurry, Mongoose procs and whatnot, I can swing my Mooncleaver around at around 2.4 seconds, crit steadily with almost 40% crit rate self-buffed and still hit slams and MSes in the 2k neighborhood with 1990 attack power (atm) self-buffed. Throw in pots, consumables and raid buffs, and it only gets better.<br>
<br>
But rather than saying take a 2hand-wielding warrior over a DWer, I think a great melee group can consist of both (and 2 cheers for Commanding AND Battle shouts for a melee group. Get a MSers, a shammy, a feral druid, a rogue and either another rogue or a DW fury warrior and you have a potent melee group.</div>

</div>First, why should your AP be alot different with a 2 hand fury build? You're not making any kind of sense with regards to that. Aside from that, what exactly are you doing on the Mechanics and Theorycrafting forum again, if you don't like sheets and mathematics? That's basically what this part of the forum is used for, so the not so conservative people here, actually can try to see IF the different fury spec's actually are that different in the end.<br>
<br>
The issue brought up here, was specificly the issue with HS being the only good ragedump past BT/WW at cooldowns, and HS adding extra aggro (cleave adds a bit as well), the solution to that might just be two hand fury, which you are writing off as a silly spec.<br>
<br>
A thing to keep in mind is, dps scales way better than threat building, so might as well prepare to keep the damage/aggro as high as possible, as it probably will be an issue in the future, even with salvation on.</div>

</div>It irritates me how well I do with a 31/30 build, and I know more AP from deeper Fury would yield bigger slams, but at the cost of 5% damage and 5% crit, and with how I use Slam over just spamming hamstring all day, I like to have a higher crit rate for Flurry.  What irritates me is that I was gearing up for DW, and did really good up until the patch.  It still does ok, but after the change to Flurry as well as all of the epics being upgraded, my DPS seemed to drop as DW compared to what I do with a Gorehowl now.  It's not really as fun for me to just auto attack, slam, instant, auto attack, slam, instant, yet it's doing better until I get a lot better gear than I had before, and my stats before were not exactly slacking.  I just finished upgrading my axe to a Wicked Edge of The Planes last night, but I won't even be using it until I finish out grinding Arena points for a new off hand and get both enchanted.<br>
<br>
Another thing that annoys me about 2h builds is on trash clearing when something is about to die (or just whenever actually) and it moves right before your last slam lands.  It happens a lot, and it's especially bad on any boss encounter that doesn't allow you to just stay in a fixed position the majority of the time.  Slam is what makes any 2h build good (and of course Windfury), and if you are whiffing Slams and having an excess of rage at all times, you may as well just go DW and dump rage through HS.  I do very good with my current 2h setup, but I also get very annoyed with it while using it.  I never got "annoyed" while DW other than the times where I wouldn't crit for 8 seconds and have to build Rampage back up from zero.</div>

Rogues everywhere were the most frustrated. Alot has changed since then, and as everyone learned the instances you could make it viable to be melee heavy and get it done. <br>
<br>
It is deffinitely the build and the player that will make either form of the warrior effective. And I had changed back to protection just before the 2.1 patch as our raid needed it and I was getting annoyed by the dps plate gear available. Pretty much any of the decent gear is raid and heroic only. Which in essence really as a whole screwed the dps warrior over to some degree. Which is probably why I have seen so many in the pvp/arena to get something decent for their damage outputs. There were some good dps quest items however which were nice, but few and far between. Natasha's choker, chestplate of A'dal come to mind.<br>
<br>
And on a last note, ya druids, and priests can do very good dps. Even holy priests with smiting can do fairly average dps which surprised me. Not groundbreaking or leader of the group, but more than I would have given them credit for.</div>

I personally have no issues with threat with salvation on. Sure I COULD have Blessing of Might, just like casters COULD have wisdom, but thats what you gotta do to keep your threat down. <br>
<br>
As for 2h/1h....back in the day on select fights I could keep ahead of the fury warriors when we all had full BWL loot and I had Ashkandi, but fury had more consistant dps. Its tough to say which is better PvE, but I'd definately lean towards DW fury. When I replaced my Lunar Crescent with The Planar Edge and a 53dps green offhand, my raid boss dps immediately went up. Then the gladiator off-hand put me on top of the charts.<br>
<br>
Its tough to judge warriors sometimes, though...there is another fury in my guild with almost equal stats, but WAY behind in dps. Its tough to say if they maintained their buffs, used the right abilities, etc.</div>

</div>And they're rather pointless as well. One does not know your gear situation, your guild's progression, or the dps situation that you felt was a useful benchmark to argue your cause.<br>
<br>
However, I do agree with some of what has been said here. Using a 2hander is decent damage but at high levels of progression, will fall short of top 5 IMO. (assuming you have competitive dps that is restricted by your tanks abilitiy to hold aggro, instead of your dps's ability to output damage) <br>
<br>
Looking at kill shots of somewhat "unfarmed" content, I have yet to see a 2h wielding warrior do enough damage to thorougly warrant his raid spot for the sole purpose of dps. This is not to say that 2h wielding warriors are useless in a raid environment because they are useful OT's and sources of debuffs (imp demo, bf, ms) while doing meaningful dps in a situation that might warrant it (hydoss aoe, tidewalker murlocks, solarian adds). <br>
<br>
But in all truth, I do not find my raid spot deserved unless I'm ATLEAST in top 5 damage done consistantly on a non-gimic fight because of personal beliefs in terms of filling my "dps role." And I feel that being DW Fury is the only way to achieve this damage on a consistant basis. And, my feelings are confirmed when I look at kill-shots where dwing warriors are doing competitive damage that is putting them in a top5 spot. <br>
<br>
A lot of the proof I needed to warrant going fury was found on this board or on random world first SS's on WoR's. People who seemed to be using DW fury to its full effectiveness that I could see from such screenshots were Modrack of Juggernaut, Alexandra of Exanimus (i think?) and Prophet of Curse.</div>

</div>How is ranking in your top 5 an effective measure of performance?  Not saying it's the case, but what if you ran with a bunch of ninnies? Being in the top 5 would be meaningless.  What if you were running with a bunch of gods?  Then being 7th could mean you were getting the absolute maximum DPS possible.  Do DPS dealers who rank below 5th on your Raid not deserve their slots?  By setting 5th as the magic number, clearly there are going to be a number of undeserving players attending.<br>
<br>
So perhaps looking at raw DPS is the only effective way of measuring the validity of 2h specs and any ranking within a Raid is meaningless. <br>
<br>
I've been waiting on the Prince to drop Decapitator for me.  I've got his dagger for my OH, but he's been fussy about giving up any axes.  In the mean time, I've been 31/30 with Axe of the Gronn Lords and I've been regularly noting my DPS on Gruul and other bosses where I can go all out DPS.  Once I get my Prince Decapitator, I'll respec to DW again and then should be able to accurately determine which is more effective in my Raid at our stage of progression and gearing.<br>
<br>
For me to report that I was second on our last Gruul kill is meaningless.  it doesn't say how skillful I am or if I'm using my abilities to their best advantage.  But since it could be assumed I'd not get any better or any smarter by changing specs, looking at the raw DPS change when I respec may have something to say about the relative merit of each spec in my Raid.</div>

</div>A lot depends on your group makeup. If you are in a MT or Feral OT group against hard hitting opponents then the Agi totem (+dodge) helps out your tanks a lot more than Windfury does (assuming your tank is good enough to generate the threat), whilst still providing a not-inconsiderable crit buff to the group.<br>
A Feral tank will obviously always want agi, not only does it provide a huge dodge buff, but threat generation goes stratospheric with the extra crits.</div>

		<div id="post_message_371166">I have two answers to the OP's question.<br>
<br>
In regards to the "future" of DPS Warriors, I'm quite certain there will always be a case for them in a raid group. Sure, if your guild is really trying to min-max then Feral Druid B or Protection Paladin C might be a better choice - but for those who don't go to such extremes the DPS warrior will always have a place as a tank up until the point you reach the boss encounter and you want him to DPS.<br>
<br>
The builds we have, while having some lacklustre talents - do include some very useful group buffs: Blood Frenzy, Imp. Shouts, TC, Demo etc.. which will likely justify the case of having a DPS warrior in the raid. I won't expound on those further as it's a discussion which has been thoroughly canvassed before.<br>
<br>
In regards to the DPS warrior's personal DPS:<br>
<br>
This is largely limited by your tank. I read lots of threads, especially on Blizzard forums, asking for us to have a threat wipe or reduction. It's my feeling that we will _never_ get this as it largely distinguishes us from the Rogues. (As an aside, I prefer the "Berserker" aspect of Warrior DPS, than the safety of Rogue damage, so to say).<br>
<br>
With BoS, you would have to be pulling out a massive amount of DPS to top a skilled tank - I think the number quoted earlier was around 1700+ DPS?<br>
Since I'm quite confident that you are not near this cap, then reducing your rage by using Heroic Strike is a viable solution to managing your rage gen/skill use.<br>
I personally don't see a problem for DPS warriors now - I do however see a potential issue for tanks if our threat doesn't scale up with the DPS gains made by the raid as a whole - but that's beyond the scope of your question.<br>
<br>
There are always going to be "gimmick" fights with aggro reductions on the tank, and so forth which limit the DPS Warrior.<br>
<br>
Do you have any postable stats of your TPS in comparison with your tank and your damage output to look at?</div>

</div>You have to draw the line somewhere in terms of who is an extremely good source of dps and who is interchangable. Considering my guild can knock off a good 17-20% of hydross's hp in one minute, it's safe to assume:<br>
<br>
3.5million hp<br>
3.5*(1-.8)=595k-700k<br>
(595k-700k)/60sec = 9916 - 11666dps/14dps classes= 708 - 833 dps <br>
<br>
we have 7 healers, 2 hybrid tanks, and 2 MT's for that fight so 14DPS<br>
<br>
700+ dps average on our dps is pretty indicative that our dps doesn't suck, and we're currently working on Leo so we're obviously not a bad guild. <br>
<br>
Being top 5 damage done of a guild that can consistently push 700+dps average pretty much guarantees that when a raid is forming, you will selected over somebody who consistently places lower then you. It also means that you become an asset to the guild in terms of dps, that simply isn't a replaceable spot holder, especially considering warriors aren't exactly the biggest source of utility. <br>
<br>
It's cool if you believe 2h warriors are viable, but to me atleast, viable doesn't mean much when you strive for being an irreplaceable asset to your guild's dps.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">As for Piercing Howl counting as a daze effect for Heroic Strike added damage, I'm fairly sure it counts as the daze. Bosses that are immune to the slow effect still get the debuff that says "Dazed." I've also noticed that when I was tanking and someone was keeping Piercing Howl up, my tps was in general 30-50 higher than without (this was at Gruul, so rage wasn't a limiting factor). However that could be just a "feeling" and not really hard evidence.</div>

</div>That's the problem. I have yet to see an MS warrior or a 2h fury warrior pull off significant dps in a raid setting consistently. The only time a ms warrior shines is if there is a gimmick to a fight requiring quick spurts of aoe like on hydross. However, fury warriors pull off amazing damage whether it be single target, or aoe situations since they have cleave almost taped down with the excess of rage available. <br>
<br>
I have seen numerous screenshots of said fury warriors. Just recently, prophet from curse was 2nd on the dmeter in their Hyjal kill shot which is solid proof of fury warrior validity. I have yet to see such screenshots on meaningful content. A screenshot where a warrior is buffed up the wazoo and whailing on gruul that's been farmed for months isn't really useful in terms of gauging a warrior's damage potential. Anybody can do relatively good damage on farmed content when people do not feel the need to push the limits of their potential.</div>

If anything, having an Arms and Fury warrior in a raid party seems to have an synergistic result.<br>

Can Arms do as much dps as Fury over time? Usually not, but Arms brings things to the table (and to the raid) than Fury doesn't. <br>
<br>
It's not always about who can sit higher on the damage meters if a build is bringing something worthwhile to a raid and holding their own when it does come to damage. And 2hand fury and MS/deathwish (both with imp Slam) can hold their own, these days.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">If this is in reference to my WWSs, the last Gruul kill was the first post-patch, we had lost our best healer, had people in completely new to the fight (and 25 mans in general), etcetc. It took about six tries to kill him so people were definitely not slacking.<br>

		<div id="post_message_372054">@ OP: You've said our limiting factor in damage output is being able to make our rage worth more damage per point. You're already doing this with any gear upgrade... In my experience the factor which most limits damage is threat. I get grouped with a shaman and druid for windfury and 5% crit, which keep me near 100 rage at all times. Raid buffed I sit at 2500 ap (without BS/Rampage up) and 37% crit. I can keep up with any DPSer for good amount of time till I have to auto attack to let the tank build up threat (this is not going all out either). Alternatively I can DPS till I pull aggro and die to wipe my threat completely.<br>
<br>
There will always be room for one or two DPS warriors in raids and there will be things we're amazing for, like Vashj stage 2 (on elementals). Personally though, gear has taken me to a point where I can no longer DPS merrily the whole fight, I reach the threat ceiling too fast. I'm not trying to brag - I really think once a warrior gets very good gear their threat production is too high. It doesn't look like things will change much in the future unless: a) [my] tanks can start generating a lot more threat  b) warriors get a threat reduction/transfer ability/talent or a buff to the passive threat reduction of berserker stance. Has anyone tried Prism of Inner Calm? Is -54 threat from all crits enough to lengthen our DPS time?</div>

Since I'm quite confident that you are not near this cap, then reducing your rage by using Heroic Strike is a viable solution to managing your rage gen/skill use.</div>

</div>You have to keep in mind though, that using Heroic Strikes as a rage dump will result in you getting aggro way lower than doing 1700+ DPS. The pure aggro component of heroic strikes is non insignificant.</div>

</div>I was really hoping for that too, but the trinket in its current form seems EXTREMELY underpowered. <br>
<br>
Prism of Inner Calm<br>
Binds when picked up<br>
Unique<br>
Trinket<br>
Requires Level 70<br>
Equip: Reduces the threat from your harmful critical strikes.<br>
Equip: &lt;Crit Threat Reduction Spell&gt;<br>
<br>
Melee Crits = -54 threat<br>
Spell crits = -216 threat<br>
<br>
Assuming you use a 2.6 1hander in your mh, and a gladiator weapon in your offhand, you'll have:<br>
<br>
2.6/1.3 = 2 second attack speed flurried<br>
1.5/1.3 = 1.15 second attack speed flurried<br>
<br>
60/2 + 60/1.15 = 82 swings white<br>
60/6 = 10 Bloodthirsts<br>
60/10 = 6 Whirlwinds<br>
<br>
(82+10+6)=98 swings per minute * 1.2 (windfury) = 117.6 swings per minute<br>
<br>
assume a 40% crit rate (very hard to achieve)<br>
<br>
117.6 * .4 = 47.04 crits * -54 = <b>2540 threat per minute reduced / 60 = -42 TPS<br>
</b><br>
Things to consider: I did not include miss rate, dodge penalties, or glancing blows which would just hurt the prism even more so in terms of viability. It's funny that a trinket with item level 128 would be less efficient then a drop from Fankriss which has its on use @ 50% less threat even at 70. <br>
<br>
I really hope it gets buffed.</div>

</div>I for one think that aggro being the cap for DPS warriors is quite a clever design decision.<br>
DPS classes with aggro control should have an advantage on hand: rogues, hunters, even locks and mages (shatter and invisibility)<br>
<br>
And I'm not saying this out of spite. At the end of vanilla WoW I was one of the DPS warriors (fury specced, with ALL the good gear up to 4HM), so I know how it is to be threat capped.<br>
It still does have its use though. Namely most of the zerg encounters (think NEF, Fankriss) or bosses without aggro caps (C'Thun). And I'm pretty sure equivalent use will be found in BC (have pulled Vashj only once last week, serious attempts to follow the coming days).</div>

Pretend I have a certain amount of hit, say +10 with talents. I swing 100 times and I get 40 crits because my crit rate is 40%. Now pretend I hit 95 times because I drop 5 hit from gear.

</div>You will still crit 40 times.<br>
Crit is a portion of ALL swings (including misses/dodges/parries). Not a portion of connecting swings.<br>
<br>
misses/parries/dodges/blocks/glances first eat into your "normal" hits.<br>
Considering that glancing chance was reduced to something like 20%. And assuming low +10% hit on DW fury warriors, we'd have (at worst):<br>
<br>
15%miss, 6% dodge, 6%parry, 6% block, 20% glance<br>
<br>
when attacking from the front.<br>
<br>
This worst case would still leave you with a 47% crit chance before being "crit capped" (read: crit being eaten way).<br>
Attacking from the back (which should be the norm) and having more +hit (pre BC I was really comfortable at +15% hit levels) would further increase the crit cap.</div>

		<div id="post_message_372373">I'm not understanding how all you guys are having agro issues. Are you not getting salvation?<br>
<br>
- Our MT generates around 750-850 TPS usually.<br>
- Fury/battle stance is 20% less threat<br>
- Salv is 30% less threat<br>
<br>
If i'm not mistaken, they multiply to a 56% agro reduction. So if the tank is doing 800 TPS you would have to pull 1400+ DPS to catch up to him. (Obviously that's if you aren't laying down heroic strikes as a rage dump though) I don't see how any warrior can sustain 1400 dps. Most of the WWS and damage meters i have seen show warriors being from 900-1100 dps, depending on the fight.<br>
<br>
The only other thing i wanted to throw in, is with the way that paladin buffs work it's rare/impossible to get a 15 minute salv, as it would be on the MT too. So I end up with a 5 min salv usually, and have issues with it running out when we get to deathwish/recklessness/execute range.<br>
<br>
Just from personal experience, the only time i ever have to consider threat is if i don't have salvation, or it's a twitchy agro fight with agro reduction or something.<br>
<br>
Any other thoughts on this?</div>

</div>That's part of the difficulty.  Even Cleave can output a decent amount of hate.  What do you do as a rage dump when hamstring isn't enough?  If you have to resort to lower damage abilities or to nothing, you're still threat limited.  I'd agree with people above though, there's no reason that warriors need to top DMs in threat sensitive encounters.  My only disappointment with this arrangement is that when we upgrade our DPS, it doesn't help us everywhere.</div>

(Obviously that's if you aren't laying down heroic strikes as a rage dump though) I don't see how any warrior can sustain 1400 dps. Most of the WWS and damage meters i have seen show warriors being from 900-1100 dps, depending on the fight.<br>
<br>
...<br>
<br>
Any other thoughts on this?</div>

</div>I DPS as 2H fury and the cycle I use is BT, WW, 2xSlam while those are on cooldown, repeat. I'm going to show a very idealized twelve seconds of damage, but if my math and understanding of how to do this aren't wrong (they may well be) you'll see 1400+ DPS is easy to sustain.<br>
<br>
Assuming full raid buffs, mongoose and flurry both up (2.82 attack speed for Lionheart), crits only on special attacks (I'm using lower end numbers from what I usually crit on specials and a constant 1100 non crit for auto attacks), and ignoring lag with the global cooldown this is what I get.<br>
<br>
0s: 1100 auto, 2800 BT (6s cd)<br>
1.5s: 2600 WW (8s cd)<br>
2.82s: 1100 auto<br>
3.0-3.5s: Slam cast; 2700<br>
4.5-5.0s: Slam cast; 2700, swing timer is reset at 4.5s (or does it reset when slam finishes casting?)<br>
6s: 2800 BT<br>
7.32s: 1100 auto<br>
9.5s: 2600 WW<br>
10.14s: 1100 auto<br>
11-11.5s: Slam cast; 2700<br>
12s: BT is back up<br>
At this point cooldowns get further apart so you might spam slam for a bit, but you can see what the cycle idea is.<br>
This is 23,300 damage over 12 seconds, or 1941 DPS. Sure I have specials critting 100% of the time and the crit rate overall is 60 odd percent, but I excluded windfury procs so don't fault me :P<br>
<br>
Perhaps it's wrong that warriors can do this much damage and threat should be our limiter, but even DRUIDS a hybrid have cower and I've never seen a cat in danger of pulling aggro.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">That's the problem. I have yet to see an MS warrior or a 2h fury warrior pull off significant dps in a raid setting consistently. The only time a ms warrior shines is if there is a gimmick to a fight requiring quick spurts of aoe like on hydross. However, fury warriors pull off amazing damage whether it be single target, or aoe situations since they have cleave almost taped down with the excess of rage available. <br>
<br>
I have seen numerous screenshots of said fury warriors. Just recently, prophet from curse was 2nd on the dmeter in their Hyjal kill shot which is solid proof of fury warrior validity. I have yet to see such screenshots on meaningful content. A screenshot where a warrior is buffed up the wazoo and whailing on gruul that's been farmed for months isn't really useful in terms of gauging a warrior's damage potential. Anybody can do relatively good damage on farmed content when people do not feel the need to push the limits of their potential.</div>

The only time I am never in the top three, barring death is on something like Tidewalker, where all of the melee remain on him while Warlocks and Mages take care of the murlocs.  I don't particularly enjoy raiding with this build for many reasons, and cannot wait to spec back to my regular DW build, but just because you have not seen anyone do extremely well with a 2h build does not mean it doesn't happen.</div>

</div>Haven't seen a good feral druid then. My younger brother is our OT/DPS on single tank fights. I think he was fifth on gruul and sixth on magtheridon last week.<br>
<br>
That's REALLY theorycrafted, whether it's correct or not. Looking through all the WWS and personal damage meters, the only time you see long term 1000+ dps is on occasions where we can cleave/whirlwind multiple mobs....like Illhoof or Hydross.<br>
<br>
You also aren't factoring glances, and no offense, but 1100 auto-attack seems rather high. I don't know if you are theory crafting them without armor or something. I use a gorehowl for my AoE work, and even with 3000 AP buffed you are only looking at a top end of 1200ish pre-armor. So more likely around 1000 auto attacks.<br>
<br>
In Theory, we can push thousands of threat per second, but it rarely works out like that. If flurry drops, chain glances, or dodges can leave you rage starved all of a sudden and really kill your DPS in a hurry.<br>
<br>
I think a lot of us have biased opinions on what we have personally experienced. Eg. i rarely make top 5 dps, where as Graul is usally top 3. Is that because of gear difference? Skill difference between him and I? Or because the rest of my raids DPS is better then his?</div>

</div>All I have right now is a screenshot that I've posted before.  Using WWS isn't an option right now other than to show my own personal stats (which I can start doing), because interest from the rest of the guild logging everything is not very high right now.  This was our first Mag kill after the patch:<br>
<br>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304081031im_/http://img514.imageshack.us/img514/6624/wowscrnshot052307211636ix9.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<br>
It's loosely similar to what Lav has here: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304081031/http://www.lossendil.com/wws/?report=5fai3dv3vy3gy&amp;s=1832,2573&amp;m" target="_blank">http://www.lossendil.com/wws/?report...&amp;s=1832,2573&amp;m</a><br>
<br>
Buffs I had were Might, Kings, LoTP, SoE, WF and 20 str from food.  I also died once during a quake that bounced me into a cleave.  Amaterassu also died, or else he would have been much higher.  Mag might be a horrible fight to use as an example, but it's currently the only "evidence" I have of anything.  Obviously some classes were at a disadvantage here due to being on cube duty, but Guildbank is almost always number one on every fight, and since this is a Warrior DPS thread, I don't see how comparing myself to him is irrelevant when talking about a DPS Warrior's use/damage in raids.<br>
<br>
What fights do you think are "more fair" to all classes in general that would be worth using?<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Yes I did, please read a persons post fully before replying.  And I'm sorry, how exactly do Rogues have to switch targets more than I do?  You seem to want to be turning this thread into "2h DPS is not competetive, only DW can do anything" because you just don't want to believe it for whatever reason.</div>

</div>Why would I not want to believe it considering I play a warrior? I don't believe it because I've seen the evidence first hand. I have yet to see a fight where a warrior who is using a 2hander, can significantly hold his weight, unless it's a funny aoe zerg type encounter like Phase 1 Nef. <br>
<br>
I don't understand why you'd post such a poorly balanced encounter at all to use as proof of your cause. It does nothing at all but act as clutter. <br>
<br>
And Lurker below is definitely a ranged fight after the patch. Melee are the only ones that get hit by whirl, and they're also threat capped. Ranged on the other hand have no worries at all in terms of threat, and the water does trivial damage meaning they lose maybe 5 seconds per a spout while melee are constantly worried about their hp/dying. Also, your MT can occasionally be knocked out of melee range (depends on your tanks positioning) meaning a mistake by your MT is a melee dps's death. <br>
<br>
Shadow Priests especially are free to wreak havok on this boss because of their ability to go all out. A shadow priest with 1000+ shadow damage, raid buffed to the extreme is literally an aggro producing factory (1300+ TPS easily) that rips chunk out of lurker.</div>

</div>Competitive in what? Gruul and Mag? I'm sorry, but gruul stopped being an important encounter a long time ago. Have you ever bothered to think about how gear past gruul increases the other dps classes' dps? Or you still stuck on the idea that because YOU, just only YOU do decently in your guild's raid, which is far from game-breaking, that 2handers are viable?<br>
<br>
I'm fairly sure that I will have a stormherald in the next few days. I can spec into 2handed fury or MS but i'm almost positive my dps will be lackluster simply because 2handers are outpaced by other dps classes due to class mechanics. <br>
<br>
Next time you decide to post a screenshot, actually put in the dps and a WWS breakdown along with it so people can actually see how you stack up to other guild's dps. A case of you outgearing the hell out of your guild proves nothing in terms of viability.<br>
<br>
When my guild does gruul, our top mage/lock/sp all do 1000+dps. They are all on the brink of pulling aggro no matter how hard they try to keep their threat down. How does that compare to your guild?</div>

</div>Probably Solarian, Morogrim or Kazzak. It really depends on your strats. It's important to find a fight where you are not completely threat capped due to a boss mechanic like hurtful strike. It's impossible to do full dps as melee on Gruul w/o a Fetish. I'd go splat every time.</div>

		<div id="post_message_376066">Pre TBC I have always been a MS or off-tank MS spec and back in BWL and AQ days was consistently in the top 3 of raid dps. With the coming of TBC’s smaller raids and lack of WF totems I decided to try out the MS fury 2 hand spec because MS was just falling short of the dps I was used to. It really performed for arena but was still a little low PVE wise without a shammie. Recently I decided to try a deep DW fury build with 15 in prot for tanking heroics (seems really hard these days to get a heroic as a full dps build) My first raid with the DW build I place about 5 to 6 in raid dps and after reading this post I think one of my major problems was using HS WW BT as a main skill set instead of BT WW with HS or Cleave as my rage dump. Though I can say with Salv I had no problems spamming HS the entire fight. Here is a link to our first Gruul kill (yes we are not a ground breaking guild lol) and my first DW run.<br>

I was hoping you guys could give me a little insight into the fury skill cycles and maybe some gear pointers <br>
The gear currently in my Armory profile is my MS gear. My DW gear puts me at 200 to hit around 2200 ap with BS  and about 25.5 to crit. Any help would be appreciated.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">That's not just how Fury Warriors work.  It's damn easy to hit the threat cap if you are spamming Heroic Strike.  But with Blessing of Salvation and using less aggro intensive attacks you shouldn't be in such danger.</div>

</div>How is settling for using "less aggro intensive attacks" proving anything? Even cleave has massive threat associated with it, which people fail to realize. The only reason to spam it is you have an excess of rage and you feel like purposely doing less damage in order to dump rage. <br>
<br>
Warrior <br>
Battle Shout 	+60 (rank 7)<br>
<b>Cleave1 	+130 (rank 6)</b><br>
Demoralizing Shout 	+43 (rank 5)<br>
Devastate1 	+101 (all ranks)<br>
Hamstring1 	+181 (rank 4)<br>
<b>Heroic Strike1 	+196 (rank 10)</b><br>
<br>
Notice the large amounts of threat that are associated with both attacks? The only reason people get the impression that cleave is a safe rage dump is because it costs more rage, meaning they can spam it less. However, cleave is nothing more than a giant load of inefficiency (especially untalented).</div>

		<div id="post_message_376989">Could I ask about something that completely puzzles me.<br>
<br>
I see posts talking about achieving a certain rank on the damage meter, being top 5 or whatever and I can't understand at all why players think that way. If you can do X and come 3rd on the meter or you can do 90% of X while simultaneously buffing 8 other dpsers' damage by 4% and that will get you 8th on the meter surely the latter is preferable.<br>
<br>
It's as if Shamans refused to drop Windfury totems for the melee group because a) they get higher personal dps if they use the mana to do a Shock instead and b) if the Warriors and Rogues perform worse the Shaman is likely to end up higher on the damage meter.<br>
<br>
Is this something that some raiding dps warriors value themselves (ie you care more about beating the next guy on the meter than beating the boss) or is this something people feel is pushed upon us (ie people think you're rubbish if you come 8th while boosting everyone else)?<br>
<br>
I can see Blood Frenzy may be weak in Kara because so much will be Bleed immune. I can see if another dps warrior has it then it's redundant for more warriors to take it too. But if you are the only dps warrior then surely Blood Frenzy is the default talent that must be taken then the rest of the spec built from there.</div>

</div>Or maybe the dps from my guild is significantly higher then yours and therefore, I have a harder time "topping the meters." If you cannot out-threat your offtank as a fury warrior, when striving to do top dps, then you're probably very undergeared. <br>
<br>
I'd still really like to see a breakdown of your damage done from your entire guild. Something doesn't add up if you're consistently #1 damage done as a 2hander using warrior. <br>
<br>
In my spare time, I'm always browsing through Nihilum and DnT forums and their MS wars with Blood Frenzy are never on top. I'm pretty sure, everybody in those two guilds actually know how to play their class to its fullest potential.<br>

</div>Blood Frenzy warriors are buffers/debuffers, they raise raid DPS enough to justify their lacklustre personal performance. Playing your class to its full potential isn't just topping the damage meters if you're a warrior.<br>
<br>
If you're pulling aggro from your tank you're either a terrible DPSer or your tank is terrible (siding with this, if your casters can't break 1k dps because they're threat limited something is wrong).<br>

</div>The whole point of this thread is to discuss the viability of dps warriors. If you're not doing considerable damage, what is the point of bringing a dps warrior? So far, nobody has posted any substantial evidence that really shows the benefit of a warrior using a 2hander, whether it be a ms or 2h fury warrior. The only thing that people have said is they hold their own which has no true bearing on the actual capabilities of a warrior. Arms/2h Fury warriors are viable offtanks depending on the encounter, but they are acting as a hybrid in a pinch, rather than somebody you bring in solely for dps. <br>
<br>
However, there are quite a few experienced and geared dw fury warriors who are dishing out incredible amounts of damage, even at the cutting edge stage of progression. I will even post a few: <br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304035435/http://www.curse-guild.org/azgalor.jpg" target="_blank">http://www.curse-guild.org/azgalor.jpg</a> <br>

<br>
When a raid leader is selecting participants, honestly, who would be chosen? A fury warrior like prophet, capable of running with some of the best dps'ers in the world or an MS warrior who lies in the middle to low end of damage done providing only blood frenzy which does not account for the damage he is <b>not</b> outputing. It's fine if your guild allows you to stay ms/2hfury incase you like to pvp or something of the sort, but saying it stands up to the dps of a fury warrior just isn't true.<br>
<br>
Browsing through Nihilum's forum, I bumped into this topic:<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304035435/http://www.nihilum.eu/forum/raids-classes/8453-warrior-damage-per-second.html" target="_blank">http://www.nihilum.eu/forum/raids-cl...er-second.html</a><br>
<br>
It shows their MS warrior Landolph on a Morogrim clear. Being MS, his damage is not as high as most of the other DPS, and his blood frenzy is not enough to make up for the damage lost from being MS instead of fury. However, that's not to say he doesn't deserve his raid spot, because he's an important part of the raid being a tank and putting out decent damage. But again, he's acting the role of an offtank instead of as the role of dps. Coincidentally, Landolph is now DW Fury.</div>

</div>What else does a warrior using a 2hander bring into a fight that a dw fury warrior does not? I already posted an example of the lackluster damage output of MS even when adding in the blood frenzy debuff and any other debuff can be picked up by going DW Fury.<br>
<br>
A DW Fury warrior is useful because he does very sustainable, high dps while being able to put on tanking gear, just like an MS/2h Fury warrior when needed. Also, he has nearly the exact same debuffs available to him while doing more damage. Hence, Landolph is now DW fury.<br>
<br>
One last note is, what happens if you are not in an optimal group? Say your shamans are all sick and can't raid. The loss of wf to dw fury warriors is no where near as bad as the loss of wf to arms warriors.</div>

		<div id="post_message_377156">Crazypie's point (to me anyways) is the following;<br>
<br>
DW fury &gt; arms DPS....i don't think that you can really dispute that fact<br>
<br>
Graul argues that the margin is small enough <i>in his experience</i>, with no evidence to back that up, other then "I'm usually top 3" that blood frenzy will more then make up his viability to the raid.<br>
<br>
Crazypie is more on the side of, "We don't have any hard numbers, so it's difficult to prove. If you are brought to DPS, then you better squeeze ever single point of damage possible out of your character."<br>
<br>
It's an argument of hybrid vs plate rogue. Almost like comparing an enhancement shaman to a rogue/mage...their DPS isn't going to be nearly as good, but their buffs make up for that lack.<br>
<br>
Personally (And sorry once again for not providing any hard numbers here) I think arms spec suffers from the "Big numbers Syndrome", where people are convinced they are doing more DPS because they see bigger number when they hit stuff.

</div>I'm not really disputing your claim, but do you care to elaborate on the 5% extra threat for your MT part. Threat is probably still around 50% physical, and blood frenzy is 5% of that so means 50% / 1.45 = 34.5%. 34.5% of your threat comes from the physical damage and it's then modified by stance modifiers. So wouldn't it be 34.5% * 1.05 = 1.72%? I only slept two hours last night so I expect something to be wrong somewhere in my calculations so an explanation would be appreciated.<br>

				Crazypie's point (to me anyways) is the following;<br>
<br>
DW fury &gt; arms DPS....i don't think that you can really dispute that fact<br>
<br>
Graul argues that the margin is small enough in his experience, with no evidence to back that up, other then "I'm usually top 3" that blood frenzy will more then make up his viability to the raid.<br>
<br>
Crazypie is more on the side of, "We don't have any hard numbers, so it's difficult to prove. If you are brought to DPS, then you better squeeze ever single point of damage possible out of your character."<br>
<br>
It's an argument of hybrid vs plate rogue. Almost like comparing an enhancement shaman to a rogue/mage...their DPS isn't going to be nearly as good, but their buffs make up for that lack.<br>
<br>
Personally (And sorry once again for not providing any hard numbers here) I think arms spec suffers from the "Big numbers Syndrome", where people are convinced they are doing more DPS because they see bigger number when they hit stuff. It's similar to the destruction vs affliction discussion of warlocks.<br>
<br>
At any rate, this thread has convinced me to at least give an arms/fury spec a try one weekend in KZ, or on our next gruul kill....just to see what it feels like.

</div>Who ever disputed that?  I certainly never did.  The thing I did not do however was bang my head against a wall blindly denying the fact that a two handed spec can do and does do well, especially until you get an equivalent level of gear required for dual wielding.  Just dual wielding doesn't mean you are going to outperform anything if your gear does not equal or exceed the gear you have for another spec.<br>
<br>
Also, people need to stop assuming that a 2h build is going to be an "Arms" build, when if you are going to actually try to do adequate damage you are going to at least have 5/5 Flurry.  31/30, 17/44 or 20/41 are the kinds of 2h builds you would use on a raid if you had to use a 2h and were there to DPS, not just as a supplemental DPSer while debuffing.<br>

</div>31/30 does not have Blood Frenzy.  I was not, nor am I an "Arms build".  A little more insight from everyone before replying about it would be super.  2h Fury was extremely good pre TBC, only being eclipsed by DW after substantial gear upgrades.  31/30 is essentially pre TBC 2h Fury but with MS and an additional weapon effect (5% crit, extra attack) as well as Improved Slam now, which is infinitely more viable with the reduction in talent points than it was previously.  This whole debate was never about a 2h build being better than an equivalently geared DW build.  The only reason I respecced to a 2h build for a while, was because after the patch I needed better DW gear than I previously had before going back.  Now I have it.  I enjoy DW much more, but the point remains that a 2h build is indeed valid.<br>

With a 0/31/30 build you lose some pretty hefty DPS talents like Precision, Imp Berserker Stance, Rampage, Impale, and Imp Overpower, but you are able to get 1H spec out of it to balance the loss somewhat. Although the extremely static nature of threat generation without Shield Slam and Devastate is extremely distasteful to me, there's no question that you're gaining some substantial tanking advantage over a 20/41/0 build or something of that nature, and presumbably bringing a little more to the raid as a result.</div>

</div>To further hit on Fury/Prot builds; I've used a few specs for OT'ing (until I can swap back to full dps); similar to what Graul posted above:<br>
<br>
My current has a bit more emphasise on actual damage: 2/44/13<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302203723/http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=LbZVVzVgxoVuVo0Ezoh" target="_blank">http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=LbZVVzVgxoVuVo0Ezoh</a><br>
<br>
This is an easy swap for Deflection: 4/42/13<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302203723/http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=LmZVVzVxxoVuVo0Ezoh" target="_blank">http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=LmZVVzVxxoVuVo0Ezoh</a><br>
(Could drop P.Howl for 1 more point in Deflection if you <i>really</i> want it maxxed.<br>
<br>
Basicly the differance in mine and Grauls is that I would assume he generally only tanked Karazhan. I am still Hybrid because I am usually confuddled into tanking Magtheridon adds, Hydross adds, etc. As he says above Toughness is great, in my opinion Shield Specalization is just a superiour talent to spend points on to open up Improved Shield Block. For a meager 2 extra points you can throw in Last Stand and Improved Shield Block which greatly increase your tanking viability.<br>
<br>
If your going to be tanking a decent bit, I would suggest going with my above route, if only occasionally (or for say Karazhan) you should be fine with only 13 in Protection.</div>

</div>Really depends on the fight and what you have going for you. As a hybrid (2/44/15- see above post) I still put out great dps, falling short of our top Rogue, but easily upper middle of the pack (top 3-6 in 25mans).<br>
As full 17/44/0 I will stay neck and neck with him every fight.<br>
However our melee group as of late has been running heavy, we finally got an Enhancement Shaman who isn't worthless, and always have a Feral Druid and we all have very good gear for our content (No bosses in SSC down yet, everything else on farm for months due to guild issues).<br>
<br>
If you keep up HS constantly you will become threat capped quick, no real way around it; especially if you are running WF. Just make sure you have Salv and watch KTM.<br>
<br>
Something like Gruul there is no way I can go all out keeping my trinket and DeathWish on cooldown spamming HS. Magtheridon assuming I am not tanking, the tank can usually get a good enough leadup. Lately when I am running raids, I have been dropping an extra Prot Warrior in the MT's group for BattleShout or a Resto Shaman for his own Windfury to help threat generation, we have some pretty big aggro-whores aside from just myself!</div>

</div>Poor choice of wording; what I was going for was it is a better place to spend your points so that you can get Improved Shield Block; your right however the talent by itself isn't clearly better than Toughness.<br>
I could live without Last Stand, I couldn't live without Improved Shield Block if I am going to tank any raid content!<br>
<br>
Though as a Hybrid tank you most likely arn't rolling in the Prot Gear; so you could argue that the extra 5% block is better than the increase in Armor, I haven't done the math and am not very keen to!</div>

</div>On a fight like Tidewalker, I have to step out about halfway through the fight for a few Murloc packs if I want to do anything other than just stand there with attack off.  On any other fight it's fine as long as BoS is kept up, and I only HS a boss (adds don't really matter nearly as much since they die so fast) if I am really far behind the tank in threat and the fight still has a ways to go.  I also only ever HS as a rage dump and never ever as a primary source of damage.  I don't know where Crazypie got that absurdly high number for hamstring threat, but I have never ever had a threat issue or pulled aggro while mashing hamstring, and I have with HS in the past, and it's easier to to land many more hamstring over the fight than HS due to rage.  I also switch out my main hand for a King's Defender that has Mongoose on it at 21%.<br>

</div>That would be my guess.  Previously I was using a Planar Edge + Fel Edged Battle Axe and did fine before the patch.  After the patch everything got upgraded and my off hand suddenly became lackluster compared to before and the Gorehowl got a nice boost so I decided to run around with that to see how it did on raids.  I hadn't really considered keeping that spec, but was primarily going to use it to grind Arena for a new off hand, and then when it actually did much better than expected I decided to just save the respec cost until later.<br>

				Were you on cube rotations for mag? From the previous screen shot it looks like you were up over 130+ dps from the 2 handed build of the previous week (The numbers are a little cut off, but it looks like it was 8XX dps, and this week's was 1036). Which is an improvement of at least 15% dps, but only an improvement of 5% actual damage...so your raid stepped it up a fair bit as well.

</div>Not on cube rotations, but then it's better to have ranged on that simply because it's easier for a melee to get gibbed by an "unlucky" bounce into a cleave.  And yeah, my DPS is noticeably higher on our last kill as well as the rest of the raid.  Also, while this isn't the Shaman thread, Enhancement Shamans are fine on damage.  Those in the shots I posted can do even more damage than what is shown, but they often stop to chain heal the group.</div>

</div>Off the top of my head - moroes/prince if you're running the 2nd kara group and the prot warrior went with group 1.<br>
<br>
There's other stuff (channelers at mag), tidalvess, etc at various tiers.  I think his point is that if you are spending a few points in prot presuming that you'll be tanking something meaningful, the extra block on shield block is worth more to him than the extra ac on toughness, particularly since you'll generally be more susceptible to spiking death than a full prot would be.<br>
<br>
Obviously full prot takes both, I think his case is for the 14 or so points in prot builds, he'd rather have imp shield block than toughness, which is arguable.  Depends on if you value the extra spike protection more than the reduced overall damage as an off-tank.  Personally I like blue.</div>

</div>Think that's bad? After 2.1 both of our enhancement shaman re-specced resto because they were convinced they can't compete in terms of DPS. The one of them that had aspiration of returning to DPS was waiting for some good weapons to drop before switching back. (Was using reflex blades and Fel-edged battleaxe if I'm not mistaken). So our guild gets it's first ever decapitator drop...and this is in like 30+ kills over 3 raid groups here. It's won by a fury warrior member (non-raider) on his first KZ run (This fury warrior is in like 75% greens here...6th on DPS behind the prot tanks, etc). He was also out rolled by a hardcore resto-shaman. If i'd have been there, it would have been defaulted to the enhancement wannabe.....stupid guildies.<br>

I don't know if your threat meters are out of whack because you are whirl-winding multiple adds and it's not set to master target, or if you never have BoS, or your MT stinks....i don't get it. I never get anywhere near the MT in threat unless he's getting stunned/knocked back or there is a de-agro component to the fight.<br>
<br>
BoS + innate berserk stance threat generation is 56% of normal (if im not mistaken). If your MT can maintain 900 TPS, you should need to maintain something like 2000+ dps in order to pull agro. Even factoring in heavy HS usage and an optimal 1100 average DPS, it shouldn't be possible.<br>
<br>
Generally speaking, if the MT has had 10 seconds alone with the mob, i don't ever have to look at the threat meters.</div>

He puts an attack speed debuff on your MT that increases the time between his attacks by 400% (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302203723/http://www.thottbot.com/s37730" target="_blank">Tidal Wave</a>) which makes it hard for him to sustain something like 900 TPS over the whole fight.<br>

</div>With an enhancement shaman, druid and hunter, 1500 EASILY. With the best gear out there, it's no problem sustaining nearly 1k dps w/ flask + food + stone and add in enhancement shaman (atleast a 300dps increase alone), LotP (another 50-70) and Trueshot + Hunter's Mark (50-70) you're lookin at some pretty insane numbers.<br>
<br>
In regards to morogrim, you're tank is probably pretty good if he can keep up 700 TPS w/ a windfury totem. Our main tank blocks for about 600 so his Shield Slam really helps out his threat gen even though Tidal Wave destroys his white damage/heroic striking. It also helps that morogrim hits RIDICULOUSLY hard meaning rage is not the problem at all.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I don't get it...it's almost mathematically impossible to pull threat off of a good main-tank if you have blessing of salvation. <br>
<br>
I don't know if your threat meters are out of whack because you are whirl-winding multiple adds and it's not set to master target, or if you never have BoS, or your MT stinks....i don't get it. I never get anywhere near the MT in threat unless he's getting stunned/knocked back or there is a de-agro component to the fight.<br>
<br>
BoS + innate berserk stance threat generation is 56% of normal (if im not mistaken). If your MT can maintain 900 TPS, you should need to maintain something like 2000+ dps in order to pull agro. Even factoring in heavy HS usage and an optimal 1100 average DPS, it shouldn't be possible.<br>
<br>
Generally speaking, if the MT has had 10 seconds alone with the mob, i don't ever have to look at the threat meters.</div>

</div>I won't speak to the specifics of the fight, but some mathcraft instead.<br>
<br>
Your DPS meter from Magtheridon of 1036 DPS for example. Lets go to the extreme of spamming HS the whole time and flurry up the whole time for max possible threat generation.<br>
<br>
1036 DPS *0.56 (berserk stance + salvation threat reduction) = ~580 TPS<br>
Heroic strike every 2.025 seconds at +196 threat per use, *.56 = 54.02 TPS<br>
<br>
= 634 TPS.<br>
<br>
Well, that's why you have an issue with your tank only doing 550 TPS on tidewalker, you are likely above that mark be a fair margin.<br>
<br>
Any prot warrior worth ANYTHING should be able to destroy 640 TPS by at LEAST 20% on any standard fight. Combined with the fact that a fair portion of your damage comes late in the fight with a recklessness/deathwish/trinket/execute spam makes it even LESS likely you will pull agro early, barring some manner of 100% proc rate on WF for 20 seconds or something of course.<br>
<br>
Is there something obvious I'm overlooking here? Is the threat bonus from berserk stance gone post-expansion? Doesn't stack with BoS like i think it does? KTM WAAAAY off?<br>
<br>
On a side note Graul, any chance you used to play a Warlock on the Warsong server a ways back? i knew someone with your name, and i heard he re-rolled warrior elsewhere.</div>

</div>He's also pretty bad at math, unless those 2 Rogues and 2 Hunters are pulling 1200 sustained DPS over the entire fight.  It's similar to taking a lackluster DPS Warrior to raids to use Nightfall.  If their DPS was already pretty bad on it's own, of course there is going to have to be something about them worth considering a raid slot for and in his case it's debuffing.<br>

				Before you go toting around the word scrub, I would suggest you take a second look at my guild's progression, progression I have been a part of as an MS warrior. Being MS was not a choice I made because I didn't want to spec out of my PvP spec, it was a suggestion made by a guildmate the realizes 4% damage for physical damage classes far outweighs my damage increase from being fury. Not only does the talent increase the damage from rogues, hunters, and feral druids, but it also increases tank threat, maybe not exactly by 4%, but definatly something close. This increase in threat allows all the dps in the raid to push a little harder.

</div>Seeing as though it's DnT, they no doubt have some very high DPS players, but it would take an extreme amount of physical DPS before BF made up the difference between Arms (ie 2h build without Flurry) and DW Fury.  And that's if Rend or Deep Wounds was up 100% of the time.  I don't really agree with his logic completely.  I mean, if it's all about non selfish specs and such, why ever even bring a Rogue?  Before the patch, the biggest difference between a Rogue and Fury Warrior was threat and the Fury Warrior at least buffed the group.  Now there is a small gap, yet the Fury Warrior still buffs the group and (so far) only on some fights is threat that much more of an issue for them than Rogues.  If BF is really that good, then why not just go the extra step and use a Fury Warrior in place of one of your Rogues since it's "selflessly" buffing the entire group, while the Arms Warrior does what he thinks is the biggest net DPS gain?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Does anyone really know this for sure?  I'm going to assume the debuff is on all the time because I'm pretty sure the Arms warrior can get a crit every 12 seconds or so.  It's not like our Rogues or DW Warriors are doing twice as much damage as our Arms Warrior.<br>

So unless you can do 42% more damage as a Fury warrior, then you're a net benefit with Arms. <br>
<br>
Now, if they do less than that amount of damage compared to you, then you get less overall benefit (relatively speaking), but of course, the marginal benefit from going Fury is being reduced also, so it should basically even out. <br>

</div>Lets focus on this for a bit.<br>
<br>
How much of a difference in DPS is there between say, 33/28, and 17/44? Assuming optimal specs/gear and positioning on a single-target fight? I personally don't think there would be more then a 20% difference in their damage. <br>
<br>
Big loses; <br>
<br>
Flurry, 10% attack speed<br>
MS vs BT; After a certain amount of AP, BT is better. This value should be attainable in a raid buffed situation...unless you have a T3 blacksmithing weapons or other 125+ dps 2 hander.<br>
10% AP off from the imp berserk stance talent.<br>
<br>
So blood frenzy would have to make up 20% of a fury warrior's damage (give or take) to be better for the raid over all. So if you run with 5+ melee of the fury warrior's caliber, or better, or if you run with more then that, then bloody frenzy would likely come out better off. <br>
<br>
For example, we ran 3 hunters, 3 rogues, 2 feral druids and 3 warriors on magthridon last night. Now, the warriors (myself included) did crap dps, with none in the top 10. 1 feral tanked magtheridon, and the other was on cubes and has bad DPS gear. But all told that's 11 people getting benefit from the buff. That HAS to make up the difference between lack-luster arms and good fury right there.<br>
<br>
I'd imagine it's also EXCELLENT for a feral druid's agro compared to a prot warrior. A larger portion of their threat comes from white damage.<br>

</div>That's not evidence at all. It's like seeing a screen shot of a mage throwing down an 8000 damage pyro when he's flasked, trinkets popped, AP up and the berserking buff.<br>

</div>Not likely. He would have had to do 1122 DPS by my calculations. I'm not familiar with the fight, but that doesn't seem likely. That much dps would put him as the clear cut top physical DPS too.<br>
<br>
Edit; Lets think about this for a minute. He'd need to improve his DPS by almost 41%<br>
<br>
Assume a 2hander fury build as the "DPS" equivalent, as i dont know what his DW gear is like.<br>
<br>
1. Your number assumes 100% BF uptime on what the physical DPS is targetting...isn't phase 2 split DPS? So some uptime is lost there.<br>
2. Flurry = close to 25% more white damage, which is 50% of his overall damage (give or take). ~12.5% more damage.<br>
3. Imp berserk stance = 10% more AP<br>
4. Rampage = 275 more AP<br>
5. Imp slam = big DPS increase.<br>
6. Imp execute would be an increase in DPS too.<br>
7. He'd lose an additional 5% crit and 5% overall damage as well.<br>
<br>
<br>
It would be close i think, with arms likely being favored.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Don't forget that with a 2h weapon, hit miss rate is much lower than that of dual weld.  You should be able to make your miss chance relatively low in comparison, especially with the Precision Talent in the fury tree.<br>
<br>
I believe the two hand miss rate is around 8.6% vs a 73 mob, with 3/3 in the precision talent you would only need 5.6% to reduce miss rates greatly, allowing yourself to concentrate more on critical and attack power gear.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_386443"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Just wanted to rehijack my thread here in regard to someone talking about threat capping your dps. I'm willing to bet 8/10 "dw fury" warriors dps using Cleave since it's "more threat efficient" than Heroic Strike. Got some news for y'all:<br>
<br>
Cleave = +70 damage (untalented) and +130 threat<br>
Heroic Strike = +176 damage and +196 threat<br>
<br>
Assuming a boss's armor reduction at 20% we get:<br>
<br>
Cleave = 56 + 130 = 186 threat, * 0.8 (zerker/battle stance) = 148.8 threat<br>
Heroic Strike = 140.8 + 196 = 336.8 threat * 0.8 = 269.44 threat<br>
<br>
Take a look at the damage to threat ratio here...<br>
Cleave = 56 / 148.8              =  0.376<br>
Heroic Strike = 140.8 / 269.44 = 0.523<br>
<br>
Holy... so the majority of fury warriors running around out there spamming Cleave instead of Heroic Strike since it's "safer" are actually further threat capping themselves.<br>
<br>
Even fully talented:<br>
Cleave = ( 154 * 0.8 + 130 ) * 0.8 = 202.56<br>
<br>
123 / 202.56 = 0.608 damage per threat.<br>
So for three talent points (read: 3) you get a whopping 1 more damage for 13 threat going from Heroic Strike to Cleave. Total waste imo.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Vashj isn't the best fight to judge melee on. First there are different amount of spawns in the different sections (I outdps the warrior who usually tops the meters by FAR in vashj p2) North has more spawns I believe, also if you get static charge you lose 20 seconds of dps and lastly you can get unlucky and get rooted out of meleerange.<br>
<br>
If you're unlucky this can easily lose you 100k dmg or so total, and the rest may or may not be gear/skill/spec-differences.<br>
<br>
And to add something to discuss - armor penetration? I picked the neck from BT trash up and replaced my heroic badge one. I'm pretty sure I made the right choice of taking this over supremus neck too, but how does armor penetration compare to haste with dualwield?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>As someone stated earlier, that may just be because of how often you do it. Technically Heroic Strike will generate more damage for the threat it causes. However it causes it in larger spikes, so if you don't time it right you could burst over the tank. Assuming you don't overaggro while going dps-crazy, you should do more dps with Heroic Strike spam than Cleave. Also Cleave costs 20 rage meaning you'll do it ever so slightly less often.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I have yet to be in a situation where my rage bar is full enough to simply hit HS every attack or every other attack.  Sometimes near the end of a fight when I switch out my main hand for executes and the mob is not quite at 20% yet I can liberally HS, but usually not during the course of a fight.  I also will continue to prioritize hamstring over HS if it is ever an issue of rage.  I do not believe that the threat of hamstring is as high as someone stated, but I could be completely wrong.  It's just that adding in hamstrings ups the proc rate of Flurry, Windfury, Rampage and Trinkets.  HS does not.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_386876"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I'm curious as to what specs 2H raiding warriors are using to produce these kinds of results?<br>
<br>
I've been testing out 31/30 (MS/flurry/impslam) and It seems like I'm mostly rage-starved the majority of the time, even when I'm in a group with a feral druid &amp; resto shaman. We also usually have a survival hunter and another warrior with Blood Frenzy. Even then, the kind of damage I'm putting out isn't nearly what I've come to expect from a warrior. To get an ideal of my dilemna: I'm usually dead last on damage meters for the majority of boss fights I get to DPS on.<br>
<br>
My rotation is WW/MS whenever they're up, and slam for rage dumps after white attacks. Like I said though, I'm usually rage-starved, so spamming slam is out of the question.<br>
<br>
My gear is pretty good, ~1700 AP, bloodmoon, max hit, 39.5% crit before raid/party/self buffs. <br>
<br>
Our raid DPS isn't horrible by any means (we killed Leo last night with 4 minutes to spare), so I've began to think maybe I've hit my limit as far as damage is concerned.

		<div id="post_message_388223">I have been very interested in this thread and have been 31/30 since i hit 70. I have loved it, its great for pvp, and for PVE with slam it seemed to deal a decent amount of damage. So I grabbed a few healers and went out to one of grull's sons. It was the son near the Blades Edge Arena. I choose him because he didnt stun but would hit me hard enough to have plenty of rage. <br>
<br>
During both attempts I was buffed with Windfurry, Blessing of Might, Kings, 20 strength food, Improved BS and mark of the wild. <br>
<br>
I used the same abilities with both fights to try and keep the data as close as possible. Below are the results i got <br>
<br>
Mortal strike build 31/30<br>
<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080130114014/http://www.lossendil.com/wws/?report=1swaptqbb2xwc&amp;a=4" target="_blank">http://www.lossendil.com/wws/?report=1swaptqbb2xwc&amp;a=4</a><br>
<br>
Fury build 20/41 I already had enough plus hit, and I put 3 points into 2h specialization.<br>
<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080130114014/http://www.lossendil.com/wws/?report=ogtfp2ju6xsfm&amp;a=2" target="_blank">http://www.lossendil.com/wws/?report=ogtfp2ju6xsfm&amp;a=2</a><br>
<br>
So just from a purely same situation same abilities except for Rampage and the cooldown on whirlwind my overall DPS went up by 120! to me thats insane. <br>
<br>
I have Tier 4 dps gear, with some arena gear, a gorehowl, not super great gear but a fair amount of good epics. <br>
<br>
From these results its apparent to me that a 2h fury build is far superior to mortal strike 31/30. This also a standpoint for pure PVE dps. <br>
<br>
On a side not i also picked up improved thunderclap and improved demo shout because I feel as a dps warrior its partially my job to help the raid and tanks with debuffs.<br>
<br>
I also understand this is not a perfect environment, and these values are pretty rough, like in the MS output there was a pally thing going on... but I still have a hard time believing 120 dps difference was not just a fluke.</div>

You're going to need about 20 minutes of sampling for the random elements to start smoothening out, which either means boring your healers to tears or doing a week or so of raid testing with your builds. 120 dps of difference is well within the range of a fluke for 3 minutes worth of fighting.</div>

Hamstring is 63 damage for 10 rage, or 6.3 damage per rage.<br>
Whirlwind with let's say a Gladiator's cleaver (1h Arena weapon) and 2000 AP (very low AP) would be 580 damage on average for 25 rage, or 23 damage per rage.  Double, triple, quadruple the damage and efficiency where applicable.<br>

</div>That is what I was looking at as well.  Go fight the servants in the blasted lands for about 20 - 30 minutes with each spec.  Your DPS is obviously going to be inflated due to the level difference, but it should at least show disparity between builds.</div>

I was top DPS on lurker until i pulled agro at 15% and got squished (and still got 4th). And with the....INSANELY good arena season 2 weapons, i should be seeing a BIG dps boost when i replace my fel-edged battle axe with a 97.5 dps off-hand axe. An improvement of 27 stamina and a staggering 14dps on the off-hand alone.<br>

		<div id="post_message_388549">Awww, where'd crazypie go?   Looks like he bailed after the WWS showed 2h+blood frenzy &gt; Fury.<br>
<br>
assuming you bring say, 8 melee dps (we bring 3 war (1 being me, MT), 1 feral, 2-3 rogues, 2-3 hunters)<br>
<br>
Our rogues do 1200+ DPS on single target non moving fights.<br>
The rest usually around 1k or a little below<br>
Our MS war hovers from 800-1000 DPS on single target, increases w/ multi target<br>
<br>
To be extremely generous with the Average, lets take 950 DPS as melee dps average.<br>
4% of 950 is 38.<br>
<br>
38x8 = 304 DPS gained from blood frenzy<br>
<br>
DPS war's 900dps(generous once again) + 304 blood frenzy = 1204 effective raid dps<br>
That doesn't include the extra damage from the tank, or the extra threat he gets, (even 2% threat gained is 20 TPS, which is very nice) Based on my usual 1k+ TPS on most boss fights.<br>
Mortal strike can also be useful on a few rare occasions.<br>
<br>
I highly highly highly doubt any fury warrior is pulling 1200+ DPS consistently on boss fights.<br>
<br>
Show me WWS to prove me wrong, but Crazypie you really came off as a $*#@ in this thread, and I really think you have no idea what you're talkin' about. <br>

"1500 DPS EASILY"  ...   show us WWS of even over 1200 single target as Fury.</div>

You can, in any combat you care about your dps this much, spam heroics as far as it goes. Heroic strike has always been a great rage dump; if it's not gruul with a fury warrior offtank, leotheras, hydross, whatever-aggro-reset-boss, you can always spam heroics with little to no pain. Actually, at this level where we assume optimum conditions, people should be playing perfectly; so you might ask for a soulstone too, and not worry at all about aggro.</div>

talented, Slam adds 140 damage with a .5 second cast time for 15 rage.<br>

Thats all right and true, but its situational and not a good reason to use cleave. Use it if you need to scale back; but by no means consider it a replacement for HS, your only limiting yourself there.<br>
Watch KTM; if you need to trade out heroic for cleave to reduce your aggro go for it, but cleave should not be replacing HS entirely in your cycle, infact if you are getting that close to the tank you should prob hold back a bit all together.<br>
Any dps worth their salt should be able to judge their threat levels vs the tank and know if they will be pulling aggro in a few hits or not. A "huge crit string" is not an acceptable excuse for pulling aggro. You shouldn't sit 2k threat below the MT the whole time, your just inviting disaster along.<br>

		<div id="post_message_388765">Experience is the big factor with threat IMO. If you know it's virtually impossible to pull threat (like prince for example) then you can HS to your heart's content. If it's a touchy fight like tidewalker (we killed lurker last night for the first time, and got some tries on this guy) then you might want to lay off of the high agro abilities in favor of a more moderated dps ability like cleave, slam or hamstring.<br>
<br>
On a side note: I know a lot of warriors and rogues are blacksmiths. How many of you plan on switching to armorsmith for the breastplate and just getting arena weapons? The weapons are very similar to T3 crafted stuff, and the breastplate is a nice upgrade over my doomplate chest ATM. This also allows me to pass on the T4/T5 chest and save DKP for the rings/neck/trinket i want (Silly rogues trying to steal my gear!).</div>

</div>For 2H and comparing Slam - the single best attack you have - with HS - the single worst attack you have - the answer is definitely that simple.<br>
<br>
HS does 208 damage for 15 rage + losing all the rage on your next swing. Call it a 25 rage cost for 8 DPR.<br>
<br>
Slam does 140 + DPS * (Weapon Speed - .5 - latency) damage, which is about 900 (low estimate). It costs 15 rage + losing (.5 + latency)/weapon speed of your next swing, call it 17 rage total for 53 DPR.<br>
<br>
So, a Slam is about 6 times as good. Without counting the fact that it lets you proc Flurry, any trinkets you happen to have, Winfury and so on an additional time, which is going to add even more damage.<br>
<br>
I guess the basic misconception leading to anyone ever hitting HS when wielding a 2h is that the resulting number is big. And hey, if the number is big, that means the dps must be ... or not. The important thing to remember is that just because the combat log says "[You] Heroic Strike [Foo] 1000" doesn't mean you actually did 1000 damage from hitting HS. You'd have done 800 of that damage on an autoswing anyhoo, now you did 200 damage more at the cost of not getting any rage from that hit. Yay. HS is crap for 2h. Don't touch it. You should even start spamming Slam before using HS, and Slamspam is horrible DPR compared to using Slam in a timed manner.</div>

</div>Like the damage meter I posted earlier says, I have no problem getting #1 DPS without using a single heroic strike.  So if that's possible (which it more than obviously is) why would you even want to RISK the additional threat?<br>
<br>
Perhaps you just need to work on your ability rotation so that you can achieve maximum damage:rage without using abilities that are potentially dangerous?<br>
<br>
Yes, your threat ceiling is set by your tank.  But again, an unlucky set of crits could result in your threat spiking over that of the tank.<br>

</div>Cleave actually generates extra threat, 130 vs 196 for Heroic Strike (source <a onclick="urchinTracker ('/external/http_www_wowwiki_com_Formulas_Aggro');" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080330030558/http://www.wowwiki.com/Formulas:Aggro" target="_blank">here</a>, could find an EJ thread about it but it goes well in line with the level 60 values in <a rel="nofollow" href="/web/20080330030558/http://elitistjerks.com/f40/t9258-kenco_guide_threat/?highlight=cleave" target="_blank">Kenco: A Guide To Threat.</a>).<br>
<br>
So, maths incoming, what you're really doing is choosing an ability with about 33% less innate threat, but at a talented <b>56%</b> lower DPR (7.7 vs 17.33.., Cleave does 154 extra damage talented, not 82). If you add the rage loss on next swing to the rage cost the DPR will look a bit different depending on how hard you hit, but HS will always cost 8 less rage and do over 120 more damage.<br>
<br>
Another interesting perspective though is that in a threat-sensitive fight what you really want to do, when you have rage for it, is to maximize your Damage per Threat, DPT. Here you only need to look at the additional damage each attack does since the base damage is the same anyway.<br>
Cleave: 154 damage for 130 threat =&gt; 1.18 DPT<br>
Heroic Strike: 208 damage for 196 threat =&gt; 1.06 DPT<br>
<br>
So, while Cleave does 26% less damage per swing and that at 56% lower damage per rage, you do 11% more damage per threat. <u>This means that in most situations HS is the clear winner between the two and even on threat-sensitive fights you can do very slightly more damage per rage while being much more inefficient</u>.<br>
<br>
Edit: Hamstring generates extra threat too, removed bad statement which assumed it didn't.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Because we want to do more than just topping damagemeters. Risking for more dps itself that is, not for a better standing. If you are so scared of aggroing that it forces you out of optimum, you might as well reroll a hunter.<br>
<br>
When tanking multiple mobs cleave gives better tps than heroic strike, but I don't replace my heroic strike button with cleave when I tank more than one mob. I just hit my cleave button instead. Same goes for dps purposes; instead of totally replacing your heroic strike, better think of a more dynamic method. I guarantee that you will not lose your top dps spot.<br>
<br>
If an unlucky crit string is so dangerous, then stay 2 crit strings behind the tank. In theory such condition exists I agree; however, I never died to an "unlucky string of crits". But I never faced an undead whose wotf is on cooldown either.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Then again, not like rage gen, and thus, DPR is an issue with the amount of damage he was taking if you look at that damagemeter parse - I guess that's the other way of going about it, other than intelligent rage management and DPR/DPS maximization, is to cheese rage gen (I was particularily guilty of this pre-BC, in my early fury days ... and learned my lesson in Naxx.)

</div>Any somewhat decent tank should be able to get sufficient snap aggro right off the bat - some "gimmick" fights are indeed Lurker and I guess Leotheras, but on that one I feel like melee is shafted half the time anyways. Thing is though, you can taunt Lurker. You can taunt Al'ar. In most cases the tank can establish some kind of comfortable aggro without any issues. I think in all our Lurker kills (and wipes) we've maybe had two occurrences of melee aggro pulling, and my guess would be that that was our enhancement shaman on both accounts. A shield slam/HS/revenge combo should pretty much get any mob stuck on you to the extent that DPS can start opening up anyway. Even without neccessarily having the MD crutch/aid.<br>
<br>
As an addendum: on any fight where aggro is a potential concern to the extent where I feel that a large number of people would have to hold back due to limited TPS generated by tanks or whatever, I throw a shaman in the tanking group. There's effectively no way of pulling aggro off of that on Gruul or Void Reaver w/ a Heroism+Windfuried tanking group.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Thought I'd reply to this again for warriors having a difficult time with DPS.  After working hard to perfect my DPS cycles, I effectively jumped over 100 DPS this week.  I posted before having only hit around 760 DPS on the Magtheridon encounter, but this week I was hovering at 900 DPS before execute range which I died(21%) due to an unlucky cleave.  I easily could have broke 1000, and this is with 0 gear upgrades from the 760 night.  What it came down to was perfecting the DPS cycles, while also paying less attention to the raid(I'm raidleader O.O).  I didn't think working on cycles alone could upgrade damage by 20%, but it turns out I was wrong!<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Out of interest what did you change?<br>
<br>
My basic priority order goes something like this (please feel free to critique).<br>
<br>
1/	Bloodthirst – For me this is #1 priority.  I'll always try to make sure I have free rage and GCD for when the CD comes up on BT.<br>
2/ 	Whirlwind – It may not be great dmg, but its still an instant (for flurry, mongoose procs) and does the dmg of a MH swing (but yellow!), with no extra threat/rage loss.<br>
3/	Hamstring – If I have spare rage and GCD free ill consider hamstring.  I only tend to use this when I have a shaman or flurry has dropped off, otherwise I skip hamstring.<br>
4/	Heroic Strike – Unless threat is an issue, I just start spamming HS when i'm above 40ish rage.<br>
<br>
With no TM at the moment I rarely overpower.  The exception would be when I get a bad streak and I'm left with low rage and no flurry (usually I switch stance on OP if I get an OH &amp; MH miss/dodge/parry and BT/WW are unavailable.  Its I nice way to get flurry back up and running with 1/2 Overpower.<br>
<br>
Rampage I tend to refresh slightly early (when it gets below &lt;10 seconds and I have a GCD free).  I try and avoid letting it drop off (or leaving it too late and having to use rampage instead of another instant that’s come off cooldown.<br>
<br>
I choose to refresh BS every minute (on the off chance a rogue was out of range when I did the last one).  So they would have to be out of range twice in a row for BS to drop off … its just too big of a dps upgrade to rogues to risk them loosing it.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

While gazing at the KTM, the druid offtank was generating a good 750-800 TPS. I think I have a screenshot of it that I'll try to post later, but anyway either my salv ran out or I got into melee range too early after a ground slam and I ate a hateful around 60%ish? I got battle rez'd a bit later and just continued to do my normal thing. Overall, an average raid performance but we get things done. <br>

I wish I could post a magtheridon kill but I click cube 3 which is a mile and a half away and I have to tank the 2nd add which makes the fight useless. I also tank priest add in Fathomlord and have to do assist with adds on Morogrim which really sucks :\. <br>
<br>
Hopefully, I can get some more screenshots with a flask/food/stone on and an enhancement shaman in the raid eventually.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Awww, where'd crazypie go?   Looks like he bailed after the WWS showed 2h+blood frenzy &gt; Fury.<br>
<br>
assuming you bring say, 8 melee dps (we bring 3 war (1 being me, MT), 1 feral, 2-3 rogues, 2-3 hunters)<br>
<br>
Our rogues do 1200+ DPS on single target non moving fights.<br>
The rest usually around 1k or a little below<br>
Our MS war hovers from 800-1000 DPS on single target, increases w/ multi target<br>
<br>
To be extremely generous with the Average, lets take 950 DPS as melee dps average.<br>
4% of 950 is 38.<br>
<br>
38x8 = 304 DPS gained from blood frenzy<br>
<br>
DPS war's 900dps(generous once again) + 304 blood frenzy = 1204 effective raid dps<br>
That doesn't include the extra damage from the tank, or the extra threat he gets, (even 2% threat gained is 20 TPS, which is very nice) Based on my usual 1k+ TPS on most boss fights.<br>
Mortal strike can also be useful on a few rare occasions.<br>
<br>
I highly highly highly doubt any fury warrior is pulling 1200+ DPS consistently on boss fights.<br>
<br>
Show me WWS to prove me wrong, but Crazypie you really came off as a $*#@ in this thread, and I really think you have no idea what you're talkin' about. <br>
<br>
"1500 DPS EASILY"  ...   show us WWS of even over 1200 single target as Fury.</div>

	</tr>
	</table>
</div><br>
I'm sorry if I can't plan my raids around this board to make sure you always have a WWS up for your entertainment, but go ahead and look at the WWS I posted. <br>
<br>
You might think blood frenzy is nice and all but how often is there a situation where you can do nothing but continuously wail on a boss with all of your 8 physical dps continuously putting your debuff to use? And what if there is a raid situation where you have no windfury while using a 2hander? And what if you happen to not bring 8 physical dps? How will your damage stack up in that situation? I have atleast posted a thread on the nihilum forum where blood frenzy did not make up the difference in damage done, and it was on a fight where dps is consistent on the boss.<br>
<br>
You can barely put blood frenzy to use on Lady Vashj in phase 2, some bosses are immune to bleed and Al'ar cannot be melee'd for half the fight. If Blood Frenzy was such a fantastic debuff, why wouldn't you see a larger amount of MS warriors in high end raiding?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
On a different note, there was a useful post on the warrior forums pertaining to a gear list for dw fury warriors. The point allocation is a bit strange but it's still useful. Kind of rare to find useful stuff on the warrior board.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Out of interest what did you change?<br>
<br>
My basic priority order goes something like this (please feel free to critique).<br>
<br>
1/	Bloodthirst – For me this is #1 priority.  I'll always try to make sure I have free rage and GCD for when the CD comes up on BT.<br>
2/ 	Whirlwind – It may not be great dmg, but its still an instant (for flurry, mongoose procs) and does the dmg of a MH swing (but yellow!), with no extra threat/rage loss.<br>
3/	Hamstring – If I have spare rage and GCD free ill consider hamstring.  I only tend to use this when I have a shaman or flurry has dropped off, otherwise I skip hamstring.<br>
4/	Heroic Strike – Unless threat is an issue, I just start spamming HS when i'm above 40ish rage.<br>
<br>
With no TM at the moment I rarely overpower.  The exception would be when I get a bad streak and I'm left with low rage and no flurry (usually I switch stance on OP if I get an OH &amp; MH miss/dodge/parry and BT/WW are unavailable.  Its I nice way to get flurry back up and running with 1/2 Overpower.<br>
<br>
Rampage I tend to refresh slightly early (when it gets below &lt;10 seconds and I have a GCD free).  I try and avoid letting it drop off (or leaving it too late and having to use rampage instead of another instant that’s come off cooldown.<br>
<br>
I choose to refresh BS every minute (on the off chance a rogue was out of range when I did the last one).  So they would have to be out of range twice in a row for BS to drop off … its just too big of a dps upgrade to rogues to risk them loosing it.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</div>It wasn't so much a change as it was better rage management as well as concentrating on myself more then the raid.  In the past I would forget to hamstring when WW and BT were on CD, and didn't notice little things like rampage not being up or a WF totem being out of range.  Trying to lead a raid and micromanage a bunch of attacks and abilities is very difficult.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I'd go axe regardless simply because it doesn't make the same gawd awful clacking noise swords do.</div>

</div>I guess there's not really much to add to this other than you choose how you spec and hopefully deliver. I'm still not completely convinced about 2hander viability because of lack of evidence or personal experience, but if guild's don't mind, I guess there's never really a problem. Maybe i'll spec 2h fury eventually and try it out, but it's a fairly big change for somebody whose been dwing since the release of BWL/AQ.<br>
<br>
In regards to the combat ratings system, the one created by Theesa is a lot different from the one on the Warrior DPS Spreadsheet. I'll put up the ratings in a bit, but the key differences in the two are the effects of raid buffs due to BoK, and the "opinion" of which is a stronger stat, hit rating or crit rating.<br>
<br>
From just opening up the DPS War SS, you get the point layout:<br>
<br>
Agil - .7<br>
Str - 1<br>
AP - .41<br>
Hit - .59<br>
Crit - .94<br>
<br>
Now I'm not quite sure how to choose which is in fact, the stronger rating system. The one on the spreadsheet seems to make a bit more sense to me as it doesn't quite value hit as much as crit. However, it seems to value agil quite a bit as well which I don't necessarily agree with, but I can understand why it'd be like that because of BoK.</div>

You might think blood frenzy is nice and all but how often is there a situation where you can do nothing but continuously wail on a boss with all of your 8 physical dps continuously putting your debuff to use? And what if there is a raid situation where you have no windfury while using a 2hander? And what if you happen to not bring 8 physical dps? How will your damage stack up in that situation? I have atleast posted a thread on the nihilum forum where blood frenzy did not make up the difference in damage done, and it was on a fight where dps is consistent on the boss.<br>
<br>
You can barely put blood frenzy to use on Lady Vashj in phase 2, some bosses are immune to bleed and Al'ar cannot be melee'd for half the fight. If Blood Frenzy was such a fantastic debuff, why wouldn't you see a larger amount of MS warriors in high end raiding?<br></div>

	</tr>
	</table>
</div>Of course specs are situational, picking on single situations doesn't make one superior to another though. E.g. i was watery graved 7 times on our last morogrim kill and ended up with lousy 500 dps, while a BF spec still would have kept my passive dps for the melee up.<br>
<br>
Yes elementals in ph2 of lady vashj don't take the bleeding debuff, but doesn't help the higher burst damage of a MS warrior to kill them faster?<br>
<br>
Another example: if you have to OT as dps warrior a BF specced warriors still can provide a very valuable debuff for the raid (in addition to 5% more threat compared to a fury warrior).<br>
<br>
I think this list could be extended endlessly in both directions, but the points is: we are theorycrafting here and in theory if your raid is hacking on a target dummy BF + arms spec dps equals approximately full fury warrior dps.</div>

</div>I'm not really sure the warrior board is the go-to source for the majority of guilds who have good pve progression. In fact, it'd be hard to actually find a warrior who has cleared SSC or even stepped foot in SSC, on the warrior board. <br>
<br>
In terms of raid wide buffing, I see a fair share of survival hunters and expose weakness is one of the strongest raid wide buffs in the game. <br>
<br>
In terms of who likes to give and get buffs, I guess it's all relative to your experience. There are a ton of enhancement shamans on my server and aren't they pretty much the epitome of melee buffing? Maybe it could be the desire to dps as well, but nobody knows for sure. <br>
<br>
Now in terms of the use of blood frenzy, how often does an MS warrior have the need to tank? And what mobs do an ms warrior tank that melee dps actually hit? Maybe Al'ar, and depending on your guild's tank choices Kael/Fathom, but one only tanks the add for a limited amount of time and I'd be surprised if the amount of dps gained from blood frenzy reached the tens of thousands. <br>
<br>
Again, this is rather a pointless discussion, because one will always search for an exception. It is of my OPINION, that target switching, bleed immunity, and lack of a shaman will be the downfall of MS warrior viability. If you bring an MS war to your raid, more power to you. It won't make a significant difference.</div>

</div>I am pretty sure I've seen you around the board, as well as replied to a thing or two you've said.  I'm also fairly certain both of our guilds are in SSC.  I am also pretty sure that not everyone is equally good at their class as another, so when talking about theorycraft and specs; what is or it not feasible depends entirely on the gear and skill of the players in question.</div>

</div>You have voiced your opinion, which is a bit baseless considering you admit you've not ever tried it. If anything, there are people who disagree with your view so you needn't be so strident in voicing your opinion. So, as there are people trying Arms builds in raids, you could either offer some advice and constructive criticism or stay silent rather than pish-poshing it. My 2¢.</div>

Fathom-Lord Karathress kill from tonight. Nearly sustained 1000 DPS as an Arms Warrior (pvp spec with imp slam). I could have easily broken 1100 DPS had I used Recklessness, and probably even more if I was pure PvE 2h spec. My gear also slacking (I only have 3 T5 quality items, the rest are gladiator loot or karazhan items).<br>
<br>
Couple of things to note:<br>
- I tanked the shaman from 20%-&gt;dead (druid tank died), had to use shield wall there.<br>
- healing is a bit off due to combat log range issues (DPS isn't).<br>
- Deeyouwhy had rez sickness and was the kick bitch on the priest.<br>
- I was mostly slam spamming, but using MS and Whirlwind as rage-dumps.<br>
- My group make-up was Rogue/Rogue/RestoShaman/FeralDrood<br>
<br>
Conclusion: After struggling with arms DPS spec for weeks, I've found what truly makes the difference: WINDFURY. This was the difference between me doing 500 DPS, and nearly 1000. With the constant procs granting me extra rage, I'm able to spam slam and MS nearly constantly with rage droughts here and there.<br>
<br>
I was also 4th on Leotheras, and 7th on Lurker (died at 20% though). Arms PvE DPS is very, very viable <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304081026im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/wink.gif" border="0" alt="" title=";)" class="inlineimg">.</div>

</div>Yup, Karathress is great for 2h because everything is pretty much stationary, I only have one piece of tier-4 (although I do have a Lionheart Executioner) and I murdered the damage meters quite badly (top place, ~610k damage done with 2 minutes left on the enrage timer). Windfury and Sword Spec = endless rage to slam spam with on stationary bosses and I'm 90% sure I would have done better post 19% damage with slam spam instead of execute . Also never used any consumables or recklessness (wasted reck on a wipe before where we died to the enrage because too many DPS died dumb deaths).<br>
<br>
I have to say I'm really tempted to spec 2h fury though, but then I have no MS and I'll be useless at farming the new arena season gear.</div>

</div>It's ok fall back damage, but WW is even less viable except on boss fights...and in most cases, the boss won't be moving around too much. MS is part of the standard (at least mine) Slam rotation anyway, so you wouldn't really be substituting it for anything.  If Slam is problematic you would have to resort to MS/hamstring in most cases.  That is assuming you have either Flurry, Windfury or both.</div>

<br>
Im just wondering what you guys think of it, and basically just curious if its worth it or if i should just go deeper fury for rampage/imp zerker stance. <br>
<br>
Also if this spec is a good one, what would i need to build besides hit? im thinking crit more than AP just so flurry stays on and to get more damage from sword spec, but AP may be better more more damage per swing.<br>
<br>
Currently im using Latros and edge of the cosmos, but im wondering if faster swords would be better for this build. im trying to buy a blinkstrike to MH but the only one i know of is quite out of my price range and i dont wanna buy something i wont use.</div>

		<div id="post_message_395820">for a 31/30 2h arms build, i think the 12agi, 3% increased crit damage meta gem followed by a lot of crit gems would be the way to go. makes it so that you don't have a yellow gem limit that 12crit meta requires so you actually gain more crit with that meta. the meta's second stat greatly benefits this route as well. and talent-wise, you gain a lot from crit, more dps than str imo (not tested yet though). flurry, deep wounds, impale, sweeping strike, and sword spec and wf (extra attacks criting is what i mean with these) all benefit from crit. <br>
<br>
speaking of extra attacks, stacking crit theoretically raises your dps exponentially. say for example you have 20% crit with sword spec. sword spec's 5% chance to proc an extra attack has a 20% chance to crit when it procs, so sword spec actually gains you a whole 1% crit (5% * 20% = 1%) behind the scenes, thus increasing your total dps by approximately 1%. at 40% crit, you gain 2% crit. these are just examples and can get extremely beneficial when throwing WF and more crit in there. <br>
<br>
fully raid geared and buffed, i think ~45% crit is obtainable by a 2h sword spec'd warrior. so sword spec and wf give you a 35% chance to gain an extra attack. 35%*45%=15.75% extra crit. also, since sword spec can proc off of WF attack and vise versa, depending on which one proc'd before, you keep chain multiplying the %'s. my math kinda stops after the first extra attack, but i'm sure you guys get the idea. <br>
<br>
anyone wanna second-check my theorycrafting and math just to make sure? lol i don't want to pick the crit-central route and realize i've made a mistake. thx.</div>

</div>this is quite similar to my current spec apart from a few slight changes i use <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304081026/http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=LAMozAioM0zZVVzmMgoV" target="_blank">http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=LAMozAioM0zZVVzmMgoV</a> myself atm, which means you get the bonus from weapon spec + very cheap heroic strike(always nice for tanking, and a rage dump if you're far behind on damage, iron will is nice for pvp, but fairly useless in pve), i didn't pick imp overpower, as i don't have TM, which basically means i loose all my rage except for the  stuff i use for overpower, which isn't worth it imo. Also don't underestimate imp charge, always nice to start of with a nice amount of rage. in the fury tree i didn't go for full commanding presence but 4/5 so i can pick up Piercing Howl, which is probably one of my favorite talents, amazing for cc. <br>
<br>
also in reply to the stat focus thing, this i my current gear setup for pve: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304081026/http://armory.wow-europe.com/#character-sheet.xml?r=Argent+Dawn&amp;n=Laknor" target="_blank">http://armory.wow-europe.com/#charac...+Dawn&amp;n=Laknor</a> which means, without the flask approx 38,5% crit(zerker stance), and 1700 AP. Raidbuffed this translates into 45ish crit, with feral druid buff, and 2kish AP. Seeing as my crit is sort of ok right now i'm trying to get my AP over 1800 AP, at which point i think i'm fairly well balanced. <br>
<br>
i do have a question though for those MS warriors using Blood Frenzy in their build. Do you think it's worth keeping the 3/5 flurry or spend those points in imp MS?</div>

<br>
Hi, new member here nice site been reading it for a while but wanted to make a post as the people here seem to know alot more than the general public on the wow site.<br>
<br>
My question is this for a human fury warrior i want to purchase either a mace or sword to take advantage of the +5 weapon skill.<br>
<br>
Next week I will have enough arena points to get my main hand weapon followed by my oh in a couple of weeks.<br>
<br>
So the stats for the mace and sword are pretty similar been the top end damage is higher on the mace over the sword but the low end is adjusted so ineffect the mace has different low end damage.<br>
<br>
So what I would like to know is there any dps advantage in pure pve situations only take one over the other?<br>
<br>
(sword) <br>
Merciless Gladiator's Slicer <br>

		<div id="post_message_397224">While we are on the subject of Arena weapons (I cannot get the spreadsheet to work with OppenOffice and no one has actually told me how to enable or disable feedback), how exactly is off hand damage calculated?  Is it weapon + AP x 50% (62%) or Weapon + (AP x 50%/62%)?  I want to get a better off hand than my current...if there really is a <i>true</i> upgrade through Arena weapons.  I'm currently using:<br>
<br>
Malchazeen<br>
One-Hand Dagger <br>
132 - 199 Damage Speed 1.80 <br>
(91.9 damage per second)<br>
+16 Stamina<br>
Equip: Improves hit rating by 15.<br>
Equip: Increases attack power by 50. <br>
<br>
The only option I would consider replacing it with would be:<br>
<br>
Merciless Gladiator's Hacker<br>
Off Hand Axe <br>
102 - 191 Damage Speed 1.50 <br>
(97.7 damage per second)<br>
+27 Stamina<br>
Equip: Improves hit rating by 10.<br>
Equip: Improves critical strike rating by 19.<br>
Equip: Improves your resilience rating by 12.<br>
Equip: Increases attack power by 30. <br>
<br>
But I would most likely go with the 1.8 speed version.  Is +5.8 physical DPS (then toss in the off hand penalty) actually going to see any real increase in damage?  I'd also be gaining 0.86% crit while losing 22 AP and 0.33% hit.  Then toss in the orc racial of +5 axe skill, which at this point, I have absolutely no idea what it does.  Is it +0.04% hit/crit -dodge, -parry per point or +0.2% per point? Char sheet shows it adding 0.04% crit at least.  Does it increase hit/crit even more vs lvl 73 mobs?  It doesn't seem like anyone has it completely figured out yet.  <br>
<br>
I'm not against grinding Arena to get one of these at all, but I'd like to think I would be gaining a real upgrade other than just more hit points.  Plus, I have this wierd aversion to ever lowering AP when possible.  I also do not want to drop lower than 15% hit, but again, I do not know exactly how much +5 skill will contribute to that, and it doesn't seem to reflect in the hit rating value.</div>

<br>
I was faced with a similar situation as you Graul. I decided to go with the Gladiator axe for a few reasons.<br>
<br>
1. It IS higher dps, significantly more so then my old fel-edged battleaxe i had previously.<br>
2. It's an axe....using daggers just feels wrong. Plus, i don't have to piss off any rogues over melch, when i could be pissing them off over the ring of lethality or trinket offa leo.<br>
3. It looks hella cool, and the....<i>vibrant</i> green glow from +20 str doesn't show on it. Saving my sanity greatly. Walking around like a big green light bulb really bothered me.<br>
<br>
Now, for you, would it be a big, or even noticeable upgrade? I'd wager it wouldn't make more then a half of a percent difference one way or another.<br>
<br>
My current plan to is to have the main-hand and off-hand gladiator weapons, and switch from weaponsmith to armor, and get the T3 crafted breastplate. That's a much better setup for me then using the crafted T3 weapon and doomplate chest IMO. This has the added bonus of giving me something like 75-80 more stamina, so i can cheap out on stamina on all my other gear and stack straight AP/crit/hit.<br>
<br>
On a similar topic. What are you all using as back pieces? I'm still using the cloak out of Shadow labs (Inciter's) I'm sad to say. I've been looking to get the drape of the dark reavers off of Aran, but he hasn't dropped it in over 3 months. The other thought i had was a vengeance wrap with a +8 str gem. It's something like 32 more ap and 10 more CR, but i give up 15 sta (which i dont mind) and 10 hit rating (which i do kinda mind)</div>

</div>I think it really is situational. Are you looking to maximize your own performance or your raid's performance?<br>
<br>
I'm currently 35/5/21, with Second Wind and Bloodfrenzy in the Arms tree, and on those mobs were I can apply the debuff successfully, I do definitely notice the difference in how fast the mobs die. Mind you, I've not been very deep in end-game content yet (still in Kara), so I cant really say about how it perfoms in a 25-man raid as opposed to 5-man and heroics. <br>
<br>
But really it is a tradeoff - by taking the debuff instead of flurry, you're trading off some of your own DPS for a raid-wide buff. To take a purely sefish view, 3/5 in flurry would be better, but then if you're going for pure DPS, why not simply go for a full or part fury build instead? <br>
<br>
But by all accounts, an MS warrior with Blood Frenzy and Imp TC/Imp DS (a.k.a. "the debuff bitch") who can off-tank if needed and produce respectable DPS if needed is a valuable part of a raid group. <br>
<br>
On the other hand, if you already have another warrior who has Blood Frenzy, then I would say without hesitation to go for 3/5 flurry.</div>

</div>Sometimes it's worth it to get flurry back up and you can slam away rage to get below 10 rage to switch and overpower. I have imp overpower in my build too but I rarely use it, it does have its uses however.<br>

</div>Imp MS is lacklustre at best, Flurry increses the chance you'll proc an enchant or windfury or sword spec, it makes Hamstring spam more efficient, keeps the rage flowing in too. The only thing about flurry is when you add/remove points it makes timing your slams a little funky until you get the feel of your autoswing timer again.<br>
<br>
Blood Frenzy is pretty okay and it helps me justify my raid spot to myself because I'm not great DPS unless it's a stationary fight, it's not like second wind would help me anywhere but arena anyway</div>

I don't think you are. I've often found myself falling into a PVP mindset when it becomes available thinking "aha! overpower with impale = automatic crit!" <br>
<br>
Which means switching to Battle Stance, then Overpower then back to Beserk Stance (tossing in some GCDs there), with a resultant massive loss of rage. <br>
<br>
All of which means your DPS goes down the toilet, especially if you were previously slamspamming away with a friendly WF totem nearby.<br>
<br>
The more I think about it, the more I would argue that the overpower skill should come with a big warning saying "for use in battlegrounds only!". The problem is that many of us are so conditioned to see overpower as some sort of "automatic crit" when in fact, I really think it is a comparitively weak skill.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">On a similar topic. What are you all using as back pieces? I'm still using the cloak out of Shadow labs (Inciter's) I'm sad to say. I've been looking to get the drape of the dark reavers off of Aran, but he hasn't dropped it in over 3 months. The other thought i had was a vengeance wrap with a +8 str gem. It's something like 32 more ap and 10 more CR, but i give up 15 sta (which i dont mind) and 10 hit rating (which i do kinda mind)</div>

</div>Right now I use the Moroes cape because it has +hit and strength, and I really love strength.  I haven't upgraded because most potential upgrades are all AP and agility, and that's just more geared for the rogues/hunters.  The only real upgrades as I see them are Magtheridon's cape which lacks +hit, and Teron Gorefiend's cape which just kicks huge amounts of ass.  Hoping to upgrade to that in the upcoming weeks.<br>
<br>
<br>
I still use Cloak of the Inciter for PvP though; it's very very good.</div>

Okay, so the cloak choices are the proverbial "Suckorz" until mid-black temple, which i am so far away from right now it isn't even remotely funny. Just going to have to make due.<br>
<br>
Is anyone actively collecting either full T4 or T5 DPS suits? I have the T4 helm, and only got that as a filler to hold me over until i got the helm off of void reaver so i'm not still using the helm of second sight. The shoulders are inferior to Kazzak shoulder, gloves are worse then Gruul gloves. Pants are inferior to other leather gear, and while the chest is certainly nice, it's not something to drop a heap of DKP on IMO.<br>
<br>
As for T5...i don't think i'm likely to get a single piece. The pants and gloves can be argued....but by and large the suit is not worth what it would cost me DKP wise.</div>

</div>Yes and no.  For DPS at the cost of everything else yes, but the added hit points make up for the extremely marginal drop in DPS if your hit points are lacking and you find yourself dipping into the red frequently on ae fights.  That said, the Kazzak shoulders have still not dropped for us or I would have gladly taken them.  Now that we have everyone "attuned" (we were short about four people) and downed VR, I would take whatever dropped first, actually preferring the T5.  I just grabbed the legs last night, and after a second thought, would never consider anything else other than the shoulders at this point..</div>

		<div id="post_message_398113">Since my guild got a couple prot tanks and feral tanks, I felt that there was not that much need for me as prot (since the other tanks got better gear than me).<br>
<br>
So lately I've been playing a bit around with the 2H Fury build (as I got stormherald, and mace spec isn't exactly great for pve). In my opinion it's not viable without Windfury, Bloodthirst is pretty weak and there is not much rage for Slam. I must say that found rampage hard to keep up in most cases aswell, but that might be my gear or the lack of windfury. The spec can put out massive numbers in some encounters or when you got windfury. But personally I would prefer going 31/30 with a sword/axe (sadly I only got Gorehowl aviable atm).<br>
<br>
I'm just not sure if I should try to go DW, my dps gear is more 2H orientated, as my hitrating is very low ~100ish, but one thing I don't understand is when people list values of str/hit/crit/AP etc. then hit is valued very low and since my rogue was my previous main, I know that hit is extremely important for combat rogues. My question is, how much hit rating should I aim for before even thinking about going DW? And what gems is the way to go when your dualwielding?<br>
<br>
Hope it's not answered already, been following this &amp; other dps warrior threads alot lately, but still not sure about it.</div>

		<div id="post_message_398118">I have top DKP in my guild and could have gotten the T5 shoulders on our first VR kill last night, but i have trouble rationalizing taking a semi-decent upgrade for me verus a semi-decent upgrade for one of our druid or warrior tanks.<br>
<br>
Of course a priest had to kick me in the balls and take it anyways. &lt;cough&gt;<br>
<br>
At any rate, i've got so much DKP saved ATM, that i can pick and choose any 3 or 4 items i want, as well as getting all the DPS plate for virtually minimum bid.<br>
<br>
@Graul, i agree on the shoulder issue, but i'm finding that as the gear gets higher and higher item level wise, it has more and more stamina. If things continue as they do, I'll break 10k Hp unbuffed in DPS gear before too long, so i'm not concerned about giving up a fair bit of stamina for a decent DPS increase.<br>

</div>Can that be our class motto or something? We were doing trash in TK last night and i somehow ended up in a mage/warlock/hunter group or something, and ended up 9th on DPS. My brother was #1 with his feral druid, and was constantly mocking me about how he was destroying me in DPS, and out-tanking me with the same spec. I said i was pretty much toast without a WF totem and we got into a big argument about how inflexible a dps warrior was if he needed a specific buff to be able to accomplish anything impressive. Anyways, the argument ended with me threatening to throw him out of the raid and me threatening to finish leveling my feral druid.<br>
<br>
On a somewhat related note...i wonder if imp battleshout or Imp leader of the pack is better for a rogue's dps....this came up in our argument when i wanted to switch him into the hunter/mage group for me.<br>
<br>
381 AP vs 5% crit and heals<br>
<br>
According to my rough theory crafting, BS &gt; LoTP when the rogue does less then 1000 DPS. Of course i'd get WAY more benefit from windfury then the druid would as well.</div>

</div>Tell him to click off battle shout and to stay out of range of totems and auras.  Not that this is some super huge feat (because melee can DPS the entire time), but we used Tranquil Air instead of Windfury on our first Void Reaver fight...came in a very close second right behind our usually top Rogue.  I think that had more to do with it being a rage banquet though.</div>

</div>For trash all he as getting was SoE, WF was down for the 3 rogue/Resto-shaman that filled his group. It's unreal how much DPS he can put out. His rip ALONE maintains something like 330 DPS (660 every 2 seconds for 12 seconds). As for VR himself, i was playing it safe and ducking out of pound, had no WF and generally stayed in battle stance to lessen the amount of damage. I was 14th in DPS. Top was warlocks, mages, rogues and hunters. Highest person without an agro dump was 9th, and he got stepped on at 6% by VR (Shadow priest)<br>

</div>I mainly put points in Imp Overpower because I don't really think there is anything else to put it in... and there might be times when it's useful to get flurry going again (when you're rage starved).<br>

<br>
@ Calgar: When we're raiding with more than 1 dps warrior, I'll often shuffle extra rogues into group 1 (tank group). We often raid with 2 rogues, 4 warriors (3 of whom DPS), and 1 feral druid. So our groups usually look like this:<br>
<br>
Group 1:<br>
Prot Warrior<br>
Tank/DPS Warrior/rogue<br>
Shaman<br>
Paladin<br>
Rogue<br>
<br>
Then group 3 (melee DPS group):<br>
Feral Druid<br>
DPS Warrior<br>
DPS Warrior<br>
Shaman (Enhancement)<br>
Best Rogue &lt;--<br>
<br>
Your MT will lose Imp and the warriors and rogues that are normally deprived will gain a buttload of damage. Don't forget that tanks get a decent amount of TPS from windfury as well. Again, it depends on the encounter, but for most fights: this is optimal.<br>
<br>
Besides, The amount of DPS a warrior gains from windfury is ENORMOUS. But, justifying this to your casters who are used to getting Wrath of Air will be no small feat. The only way to do this is to prove it. Show them your damage with Windfury, and then show them your damage without it. I believe someone did the math somewhere and even if you have a group with 3 casters, a shaman, and a dps warrior; it's better to drop windfury totem than wrath of air under all circumstances.<br>

Set as equal, solve for AP: AP = ( 469 + 210 ) / ( .45 - 3.3/14 ) = 3169<br>

</div>Battle Shout &gt;&gt;&gt; LotP, end of story.  I suppose that at some point the crit would pass up the AP, but even fully raid buffed w/flask, pally buffs, and enh shaman, imp. battle shout is more than twice as good for me as 5 crit.  The break even point is a LONG way away.<br>
<br>
Rogues are extremely buff dependant.  We have very good tools for turning AP and crit into DPS, but the lowest unbuffed totals of the melee classes.<br>
<br>
I would go so far as to say that if you have 3 rogues, a warrior, an enh shaman, and a feral druid, you are better off leaving the druid out of the buff party than the rogue.  % crit is nice, but it's the weakest buff in the party, and giving it to 4 people is weaker than giving the 2 better buffs (BS/enh shaman) to the rogue.<br>
<br>
Now, if the druid is skilled, and the rogue is mediocre, sure, buff the guy who knows how to play, but WF is down in that party, doing nothing for the druid, and it does as much for the rogue as all the other party buffs combined do for the druid.<br>
<br>
For a Rogue, WF &gt; BS &gt;&gt; LotP &gt; TSA.</div>

BS is 27 DPS (white damage wise) and even if you were to triple that to 75ish it would still barely out pace a 5% DPS increase and the healing. &lt;shrug&gt; i don't mind though, just an excuse to banish my brother to the "left-over" group of mages, hunters and warlocks</div>

5% crit is not going to be 5% more damage unless you have 0% crit beforehand and all your attacks are capable of critting, or if your crits are more than 200% damage (which my backstabs are, 224%, but they are only between 25 and 30% of my damage).<br>

I'm sitting at 35ish crit after Mark/Kings/Agil Food/Agil pot.  5% more crit is only 3.7% more white damage and ~3.2% more backstab damage (backstab crit is really high already because of talents).</div>

We've found that wearing some DPS gear makes the demons much easier while not hampering your tanking ability except perhaps in stage 2 when his dps in human form seems to go up. I think it is the same principle as wearing some of your best Epic resist gear pieces for certain fights, where the resist check you need to pass here is shitty DPS.<br>
<br>
I've been toying with the 4% blood frenzy myself, wanted to try it in SSC and compare damage meters with it and without it and see what the break point is for % of the raids DPS as melee to really benefit from it.</div>

</div>Ahh, but that's not what I said.  I said it won't be 5% more damage.  I suppose I could have been more explicit and said it's not a 5% increase over current damage, but I don't see why anyone would interpret it as "5% of my damage if I had 0% to crit".<br>
<br>
Yes, other things equal, if you do 100 DPS with 0 crit, and going from 0 to 5 crit gives you 5 DPS, then going from 30 to 35 should also give you 5 DPS, but 5 DPS is not 5% of the 130 you were doing when you had 30 crit, but it IS 5% of the 100 you were doing when you had 0 crit.

And any excess rage goes to HS (instead of slam as a rage dump with a 2H), or cleave is it is an especially threat sensitive fight or if youre really high on ktm (90%+ of MT).

		<div id="post_message_402876"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->read the title of the thread and was wondering, what stat will be the most important in terms of increasing your dps in the future? with the addition of static haste rating increases and static armor penetration increases, do str and crit lose their title as best dps stat for warriors?<br>
<br>
i'm a MS/Slam dps warrior and i know that there will be times where my attack speed will be too fast to fit in a MS/WW/hamstring in between each slam (flurry + mongoose + bloodlust + haste rating), so i'm guessing that at that point, haste will diminish in value for me. for non-slam builds, haste rating is much beter as i believe it does not decrease slam's cast time and there's no diminishing point. what's haste rating's dps per stat budget at compared to other dps stats? also consider that the current rage formula is affected by weapon speed so haste rating doesn't seem as good as str or crit for rage generation. <br>
<br>
as for armor penetration, it seems kinda weird that it's best against clothies like shade of aran. seems like using an armor penetration rating system would work much better, where you penetrate armor by % rather than by hard numbers. but anyhow, against an average boss with average armor, is armor penetration more dps per stat budget than other stats like str or crit?<br>
<br>
and one last question, i read that crit is the most dps per stat budget but i also read that crit is .94 dps value whereas str has 1 dps value. which one is correct for what type of situation? as a warrior with 3% increased crit dmg meta gem, flurry, deep wounds, impale, sword spec, blessing of kings, and wf, would crit be better than str (no imp zerker stance)?<br>
<br>
the spreadsheet doesn't support 2h dps so i figured this would be the best place to find <br>
these answers.<br>
<br>
Edit: i guess what i'm really asking for is if we can update the spreadsheet to include haste, armor penetration, new gems/gear, 2h builds, etc? is anyone working on this right now? how soon can we expect an updated one up here?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Remember that cleave also has innate threat modifier. I believe it was showed that HS gives better Damage Per Threat as well as Damage Per Rage. Cleave seems better because it costs more rage and thus will make you do less damage. It is simply better to stop attacking instead of using cleave over HS.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Another question I would like answered if possible.  I dps as 33/28 a lot of the times in our raids. And I tend to be either number 2 or three on almost every fight that isn't an aoe heavy fight(Morogrim). I'm curious if other people see dps warriors beating casters. Or do my casters just suck that much.  The usual group setup for the melee is dps warrior/rogue/rogue/rogue/shaman.  the casters usually have a shaman and a spriest with them and I can still beat them almost every time on any fight but morogrim in all of ssc.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Also, I tried 2h fury for Voidreaver last night and liked it a lot 19/42/0 seems like a solid 2h fury build for any warrior. I would suggest other warriors try it out that like 2h  more than dw for dps.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Reason i overaggroed was KTM wasnt reset as RL thought it wasnt possible to overaggro, neither did i, until then anyways ^ Anyways to answer your question who comes top depends on group compsistions player skill and how the boss works, im consistently top on some fights yet find it hard to get top 5 in others. But yes warrior DPS can surpass casters, and by quite alot some times.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I really have no "order" for my 2h dps. Rage is consistent per say, but you with a 2her you tend to go from 0-10 rage to full with WF and white hits. Keep ms and ww on cool down. Always try to work a slam in immediately after your white hits. <br>
<br>
Another question I would like answered if possible.  I dps as 33/28 a lot of the times in our raids. And I tend to be either number 2 or three on almost every fight that isn't an aoe heavy fight(Morogrim). I'm curious if other people see dps warriors beating casters. Or do my casters just suck that much.  The usual group setup for the melee is dps warrior/rogue/rogue/rogue/shaman.  the casters usually have a shaman and a spriest with them and I can still beat them almost every time on any fight but morogrim in all of ssc.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Also, I tried 2h fury for Voidreaver last night and liked it a lot 19/42/0 seems like a solid 2h fury build for any warrior. I would suggest other warriors try it out that like 2h  more than dw for dps.</div>

		<div id="post_message_404261"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I think i found out why crit is preferred when fully buffed. when fully buffed, you gain flask of relentless assault, bom, bs, tsa, wf, bok... all of which boost your ap a lot. yet you gain very little crit (lotp, bok). you gain so much ap that it starts diminishing in value quickly and crit becomes more important. it's also a good solo stat because you will already have bs on yourself and you'll need more crit to make up for it. <br>
<br>
for this reason, i'll be stacking crit gems with the increased crit dmg meta (while still getting socket bonus if needed). i also personally like seeing a lot of crits on my screen so this is kinda biased lol.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

That battle or berserk stance stats? If it's berserk, you don't have that much more AP/crit then me, and i have you beat in hit. If it's battle.....ZOMG? <br>

Going from 1500-1600 AP is a larger overall dps increase percent wise then going from 3100-3200. He would choose to stack a bunch of crit rating @ the 3100 mark instead of AP, as you likely get larger returns at that point.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I think Mongoose's haste effect (along with the crit) is probably going to attract more people. But I do wonder if haste to gloves might make a comeback and compete with 15 str s enchant of choice.<br>

</div>Indeed haste and armor penetration are the 'hidden' stats that make my gear so much better than others. 9.13% passive haste and -175 armor penetration at the cost of crit and hit, but oh so much superior it is. And also I use dragonstrike in mh, losing out on even more stats but gain the haste proc, which in my opinion is far superior to any other of the blacksmithing weapons.<br>

</div>It was a nice experience indeed, and having 14% damage done in a 25 man raid is just a very cool feeling. We used to have casters on the stationary adds at shade, but decided to change it yesterday since our melee do way more dps than our casters. The result was a kill in less than half the time it used to take.</div>

</div>I didn't halve the AP in the second example...it was +100 in both cases. The point was, that at 3200 AP, 1% crit adds more dps then it does at 1500AP, where as AP is the same amount of DPS regardless of how much you have.<br>
<br>
@SVAG We should try to model the effects of haste and -armor penetration, to see how they stack up to more crit/hit/AP.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">No, AP is AP.  <br>
From a pure percentage standpoint you have halved the overall AP increase in your latter example.  Regardless, that AP will still add the same DPS increase it did from 15k to 16k.<br>

Also I'm wondering with the latest crazes being over 2hand Imp Slam and Haste effects if we'll see the return of the Iron Counterweight any time soon.</div>

</div>Yes, AP is AP and will add the same increase in damage.  The thing is though, that's all it does. After you reach the point where raid buffed your incoming rage is almost more than you can actually spend it without using a fast weapon and Heroic Strike on every swing, wouldn't adding 1% crit will have more of an impact than adding more AP?  Crit and AP are obviously synergetic and scale with how each stat is independantly.  If you can already do X DPS, how is adding +Y going to be more beneficial than adding +% after a point, especially when you consider abilities that rely on crits?  And to the best of my knowledge, even raid buffed it's impossible to reach the crit cap now with current itemization.</div>

	</table>
</div>Just out of my head..<br>
<br>
1% haste = 1% more whitehits(+heroics), so if you hit 10000 times with 1% haste, you get 100 extra hits. Say 800 damage per hit on average, 80000 extra damage from white hits and heroics<br>
<br>
1% hit = also 1% more white hits(but doesn't work on heroics, would give you less white swings and heroics in the same amount of time, this is very hard to model), 10000-(amount of heroics) hits with 1% hit, z extra hits, x damage per hit, y extra damage from just white hits<br>
<br>
<br>
This is very, very basic math, but I really have no idea how to model it.<br>
Help? ^^<br>
<br>
[edit] What does the spreadsheet say about haste compared to hit? It doesn't work in openoffice *sigh*</div>

<br>
Hit = more white damage (assuming not hit capped)<br>
Haste = more white damage, and more heroics (assuming constant pounding of HS...personally i don't think anyone uses HS enough to actually benefit from this though)<br>
<br>
As for -armor, i've heard it said that armor protection is a linear scale of protection up to the 75% cap, even though it takes more and more armor to gain 1% mitigation. I think this has to do with something in my following example.<br>
<br>
going from 1-2% armor reduction is doubling your mitigation, true, but you are only going from 99 to 98% damage "let through", which is little more then a 1% increase in survivability. On the other hand, going from 74-75% is again, a 1% increase in mitigation, but you are going from 26-25% damage "let through" which is an increase of nearly 4%. It's that "let through" (Inverse armor mitigation?) that causes the armor formula to scale strangely as you get more and more armor. <br>
<br>
Theoretically, we should be able to track down the armor formula (Link anyone? Search isn't helping me out here) and work out an equation for how effective -armor is, with variables for amount of -armor, and the mob's starting armor (Which is REALLY easy to calculate with bloodthirst, since it hits for a static amount)</div>

Such a great feeling though, and 2k DPS sustained.. jesus I cant wait till I get that level of gear ^. <br>
<br>
  Armor ignore is good, but I think haste may be better. Ive not yet got any armor ignore items ( used to have the night blade way back and it was fun PVPing against casters with - armor value :P ) but I dont know how well it would work in a raid setting, especially as its effect depends on the mobs armor and is there any way to determine a mobs / bosses armor value?<br>
<br>
   On another note, the effectiveness of dragonspine trophy is hard to calculate as the proc rate is 1.7 PPM from listed weapon speed, the proc rate is increased by flurry = instant attacks, so for example say you have a 2.7 and 2.0 speed wep, the proc rate is 1.7 with 60/2.7 + 60/2.0 attacks ( 60 seconds / by listed wep speed ), instants also increase this so say 10 BT in 60 seconds + WW ect, that also increases the proc rate. as does WF. Its one awesome trinket though thats for sure.</div>

</div>First of all: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080209122156/http://www.wowace.com/wiki/MobMitigation" target="_blank">MobMitigation.</a><br>
<br>
According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080209122156/http://www.wowwiki.com/Armor" target="_blank">http://www.wowwiki.com/Armor;</a><br>
Levels 60+ DR% = Armor / (Armor+400+85*(Level+4.5*(Level-59)))<br>
<br>
As an example, 5000 armor on a level 73 mob is 29.5% reduction<br>
<br>
Void Reaver has 1500 armor after sunders + cor + ff.<br>
According to the formula I posted he has 1500/(1500+400+85*(73+4.5*(73-59))) mitigation, or 11.1%.<br>
<br>
With my neck as an example of armor mitigation, he has 1325 after the necks reduction of 175. 1325/(1325+400+85*(73+4.5*(73-59))) = 9.9% reduction<br>
<br>
A hit of 1000 would without the neck be 889 damage. With the neck a hit of the same would be 901 instead. A 1.3% damage increase. Nothing huge. But lets see what happens on a low armor target.<br>
<br>
High Astromancer Solarian has 200 armor after sunder + cor + ff. A 1.7% reduction. After my neck she's down to 0.2%. That's a 1000 hit reduced to 983 before neck and 998 after. 1.5% damage increase.<br>
<br>
Conclusion? I don't know. Armor penetration is good, although maybe not very noticable on its own. Lets see what happens when we stack it.<br>
<br>
Void Reaver again. 1500 armor. But this time we have 500 armor penetration from gear (not very hard to get if you're in BT). Before he has 11.1%, after he has 7.7%. A hit of 1000 reduced to 923. 3.8% damage increase.<br>
<br>
I put this information together during raidtime so please tell me if I did anything wrong, but I checked it through and didn't see anything.<br>
<br>
Thoughts?</div>

		<div id="post_message_405118">From your data Svag It seems stacking haste is more beneficial.<br>
<br>
 It's about 1% haste = 10 haste rating, and 1% haste should provide roughly a 1% damage increase.<br>
<br>
 If you have the pillagers gauntlets (38) + belt of seething fury ( 38 ) + swiftsteel shoulders (35 ) + band of devastation ( 31 ) + swiftsteel bracers ( 27 ) and 2x swiftsteel bludgeon ( 2x 27 ) thats a net total of 223 haste rating, approx 20% haste.<br>
<br>
That's like having a 20% flurry all the time. When combined with other +haste effects such as heroism, flurry ect. That's some insane damage. It also scales extremely well, as your DPS increases, the damage added by your haste also does. <br>
<br>
Haste has the same effect all the time, whereas armor penetration as shown by your data, experiences a form of diminishing returns where the armor value of the target greatly effects the DPS gained from armor penetration.<br>
<br>
Can anyone expand on that?</div>

</div>Yeah, in other words, 1% crit gives more dps at 10000 ap than it does at 1000 ap (random numbers for logic). simple as that. <br>
<br>
so i'm basically gearing myself with crit and buffing myself with ap, just to even it out.</div>

		<div id="post_message_405411">Maybe I'm looking at this the wrong way, but it seems that, at least below the hit cap, 1% haste and 1% hit are roughly analogous in terms of the amount of contributed damage. haste should come out slightly ahead due to the way that multiple attack speed increasing affects multiply, and also the fact that it takes about 5 less points of rating for 1% haste than for 1% hit. Is there something I'm missing here other than the cheaper itemization for haste that makes it much better for DPS than other available stats?<br>
<br>
   I tend to run around the 55% mark for white/heroic strike damage. Our shaman has been MIA the last week or two, so I don't know how much more of my damage would be based off auto attack if I had windfury. Without WF though, 1% haste for me should work out to roughly .55% more damage? Probably a little more, since I can freely turn any excess rage into heroic strike, for an effectively lower main hand hit cap.<br>
<br>
 If the reduce armor wasn't so much more expensive itemization wise, I would much prefer it due to it effecting all damage equally, besides bleeds. However it looks like the choice is between 2-3% haste, or ~1% increased damage from armor reduction, if even that much, in most of the slots where there is a choice between the two.</div>

As for the -armor discussion, if SVAG's numbers are correct (and i have no reason to believe they aren't, they seem to mesh with known values) then -armor isn't as great a stat as i'd hoped it would be.<br>
<br>
I used Icon of unyielding courage for a fairly long time, and when you activated the -600 armor effect on it, it was a noticeable increase in damage of at least 8-10%. I remember examples of me using it on Aran, and landing 3300+ bloodthrists when i had 200-300 less AP then i do now.</div>

		<div id="post_message_405598">Let's assume the extra haste doesn't give you any extra rage and lets also assume it affects 50% of your damage.<br>
<br>
If I do 1000 dps with only autoswings and 0 haste, doing 60 auto swings per minute with an average of 1000 damage per hit (to build up some real fact here I'd need to check exact stats... anyone care parsing a log and calculating it?).<br>
<br>
5% haste would give you 3 more swings per minute or another 3000 damage per minute, 50 dps. or a linear 5% increase of your white dps. If that would be 50% of my damage then 5% haste would be 2.5% overall damage increase (going from 2000 to 2050 dps). Very simple. The more attacks you do per minute the more extra swings you gain from haste, though. Combatlog parse of a full encounter aaaaaanyone?<br>
<br>
However this also doesn't take into account extra rage generated so it's flawed, so overall damage gain is probably a little bit higher.<br>

I'm fairly certain, that just like in vanilla wow, fury will eventually outpace MS because of the double scaling of your gear with 2 weapons.  However, atm, you are correct, most end game guild dps warriors that I have seen are specced 33/28 for imp slam build.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I've read a lot through this thread but there's one thing i have yet to really see answered, and that's the arguments as to what's the best dps spec for pve. I've generally thought that much like Classic WoW, dual wield fury still topped dps while 2h fury was made more viable. But I've recently been hearing about how great 31/30 for dps (and mabye even 33/18 to grab blood frenzy)<br>

</div>just wondering, what weapons were you using with both specs? i'm not doubting fury dps, i just want to know about where the line is where fury dps out-dps's 31/30. my guild just started SSC and TK recently so our gear is still limited. i just chose 31/30 cuz i can pvp with it as well.</div>

I'm currently arms spec with blood frenzy as we generally raid with 4 hunters 3 rogues 2 feral druids and 2 prot warriors and myself - Thats alot of physical dps.<br>
<br>
My arms stats unbuffed:<br>
<br>
1862 AP<br>
38.18% crit<br>
116 hit rating<br>
<br>
My fury stats unbuffed:<br>

1970<br>
201 hit rating<br>
33% crit<br>
<br>
I was using gorehowl for arms and decapitator and malchazeen for fury.<br>
<br>
Fury dps was ok but not much better than arms dps in raids and adding in blood frenzy put arms way ahead.<br>
<br>
As a note im doing about 800dps as arms without a shaman of any kind.<br>
<br>
I really think it depends on your raid setup if fury is worthwhile going, I personally found it underwhelming except for the 1800dps i pulled on Illhoof in a karazhan run this week.<br>
<br>
<br>
So i would not say DW fury destroy's arms at all.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Hi,<br>
<br>
about armor reduction is Badge of the Swarmguard (from Sartura, reduce armor by 200, stack up 6 times for 30s, 3mn cooldown) still interesting at 70 ? I don't wear it since BC so I really dunno if the other trinkets I have are better in raid situation (Hourglass of the Unraveller and Abacus of Violent Odds). <br>
<br>
Any advice ?<br>
<br>
Thanks !</div>

</div>I'm not a warrior, but I would love this trinket as Enhancement. Last time I checked, Badge of the Swarmguard doesn't share a trinket cooldown with other trinkets. Meaning you could pop it with your Abacus/Bloodlust Badge/whatever. Everyone knows that having AP/crit/-armor/haste buffs at the same time is beneficial as you get a mutliplying effect. If I can, I try to wait until I have dual Mongoose, Dragonstrike proc, and Hourglass proc before I activate Bloodlust and Bloodlust Badge. Having at least two trinkets for max on demand dps for damage windows and vulnerabilites could be very valuable for certain encounters.<br>
<br>
Rishina, tell your Shaman that there's no way that Flametongue/Poisons+GoA is more group dps than WF alone if you have a decent warrior in your group. This isn't even bringing Searing Totem into it.</div>

		<div id="post_message_408347">Inspired from Svag we brought one more tank to Akama this week (2nd kill) and I went in as fury. Indeed we had one wave of adds less than on the first kill and the Shade of Akama went down faster as well.<br>

<br>
This dps meters are less tweaked, we had no BL rotation (in this attempt no BL at all, since it was on cooldown from a previous attempt), and no BM hunter. Still as a "hobby fury warrior" sustaining 1500 dps was well worth the change in tactics and incredible fun to play as well (you just have to love 4k bloodthirst crits on those squishy channelers). Still can't beat our rogues though =)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Concerning the spec discussion: 33/28 is just more situational in my opinion. A full fury warrior delivers his dps as soon as he starts to hit something, while a blood frenzy/MS warrior needs the whole raid to hit the same target as him to reach the same potential. Apparently on "split dps" fights like Lurker or Akama (or on bleed immune mobs like Supremus obviously) a fury warrior has more dps potential.<br>
<br>
The new dps stats like haste and ignore armor will get very interesting for 2H builds in my opinion (2H fury as well as 33/28), since those builds need less hit gear and the trade off for taking the new stats will be less severe.</div>

		<div id="post_message_408524">As long as you know you will stay in melee for full duration, there's no reason not to pop trinkets and cooldowns. The exception being deathwish, which is worth waiting a minute popping if you're close to execute range.<br>
<br>
And to add something new to discuss.. heroism timing! <br>
<br>
We would just use heroism on melee group at the same time as casters, sometime in the middle of the fight, until one of our Naj'entus kills where enhancement shammy forgot to pop it midfight so we got it in execute range instead. We had 2 fury warriors in the group and the result was.. amazing, 100 rage executes every 1.5 seconds. Coupled with recklessness and deathwish we both did close to 4000 dps the last 20%.<br>
<br>
Since then we always tell him to save it, you should do the same, tell your shammy to give it a shot, wait with heroism until execute range. I'm sure you'll like it.</div>

<br>
1% haste = 1% more whitehits(+heroics), so if you hit 10000 times with 1% haste, you get 100 extra hits. Say 800 damage per hit on average, 80000 extra damage from white hits and heroics<br>
<br>
1% hit = also 1% more white hits(but doesn't work on heroics, would give you less white swings and heroics in the same amount of time, this is very hard to model), 10000-(amount of heroics) hits with 1% hit, z extra hits, x damage per hit, y extra damage from just white hits<br>
<br>
<br>
This is very, very basic math, but I really have no idea how to model it.<br>
Help? ^^<br>
<br>
[edit] What does the spreadsheet say about haste compared to hit? It doesn't work in openoffice *sigh*</div>

<br>
On the 1% haste thing. on 10000 hits your said you'd get 100 extra hits.<br>
Wouldn't it be more proper to say that over the amount of time it takes you to do normal 10000 attacks with 1% haste you have 100 more attacks. Because you'd still have the normal amount of chance to miss.</div>

		<div id="post_message_409562">I recently got a Cataclysm's Edge from Archimonde and decided to give 31/30 a go just to see how it would perform for me, I've been a Fury warrior for pretty much my entire raiding life and bluntly thought to myself that it would not even come close to my Fury DPS. How wrong was I, to be honest I'm quite sure I do more DPS as 31/30 than I did with 17/44 which I found extremely odd to say the least, I run with the standard melee group consisting of a Enhancement Shaman and a Feral Druid and man do I pump out the DPS.<br>
<br>
I think a big part of it could be down to the incredible Windfury procs I receive from Cataclym's coupled with sword proc just makes the extra white damage supreme compared to my Talon of the Phoenix. I usually run with 13.13% haste and around -700 armor reduction and I can certainly say it makes up for the hit and crit I will lose.<br>
<br>
Sorry I have no proof of what I say but as 31/30 I could come top 3 (rogues-_-) on pretty much any fight except supremus for obvious reasons! So in short I'm saying once you get a great 2h try out 31/30, you won't be disappointed because I sure as hell wasn't :P You can check my 31/30 stats and gear in Armory and my Fury stats are as followed:<br>
<br>
(Zerker stance)<br>
29% crit<br>
2066 AP<br>
14% hit<br>
13.13% haste<br>
Talon of the Phoenix MH<br>
Swiftsteel Bludgeon OH<br>
<br>
As fury I use the standard BT&gt;WW(1 point imp WW)&gt;Hamstring rotation and very rarely use heroic unless the MT is dishing out some serious threat as obviously I can catch up during execute range.<br>
<br>
I'm most likely going to try Fury again once I get the mace from Supremus as I feel that my DPS style is heavily based on Windfury and that mace has an extremely high top end and 2.8 speed. So we will see, but for now in my opinion 31/30 &gt; 17/44 _IF_ you have one of the  top end 2 handers. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080211185123im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":)" class="inlineimg"></div>

</div>This was the point I was ineffectually driving at in my earlier post. It seems that below the hit cap, haste and hit serve much the same function. My very back-of-the-napkin math tells me that haste should be rather better than hit, due to heroic strike, and the ability to crit. The biggest reason though, is that haste seems to be much cheaper in the rating to % conversion than hit, making it a better stat to stack up white damage once you gain access to plentiful haste gear.</div>

</div>If you don't use fury to it's full potential and you feel threat capped, of course you will do same dps as mortal strike. Also "top 3" doesn't say anything, you could be doing 1000 dps and be top 3 in some guilds. 1000 dps in Paci is barely top 10 on meters.<br>
<br>
[edit] For example, on Anetheron last week the tank was for some reason not building enough threat. I was threatcapped from 100% to 0, 420k dmg done. The mortal strike warrior did 421k. But if you check the screenshot I posted earlier of Shade you'll see I did at least 500 dps more than him. But when he's fury specced he's usually a bit in front of me on meters.</div>

</div>Why bother? Your guild uses a raidsetup that favors dps warriors totally. You get all the group buffs, melee shaman, druid, your tank even gets groups buffs to be able to handle fury threat, soul stones for the countless of times you die by overaggro. It has nothing to do with the future of a dps warrior, no other guilds are silly enough to focus their setup on 1-2 players that much. It's as interesting as the dps a mage will do with a shaman, shadowpriest, doomkin etc.  Showoff movies of gimmick fights don't really add to these forums either.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">The reason shade of akama was tailored to Svags advantage was that the fight favours melee damage, and from what ive heard, pacifism's melee generally do more damage than casters. But it was nice to see. What i would be interested in was a comparison between equal itemisation amounts of haste rating and -armor. Such as 38 haste rating compared with 175 armor penetration.</div>

That question sounds like you're looking for a comparison between <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080215185319/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=32278" target="_blank">http://www.wowhead.com/?item=32278</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080215185319/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=32608" target="_blank">http://www.wowhead.com/?item=32608</a>, right?<br>
<br>
In this case, I think you should look at the other stats as well: Grips of Silent Justice also have up to 60 Strength without any enchants (only sockets + raw stats). That makes them much more desireable in my opinion. Luckily I possess both of them (the grips dropped from akama yesterday), so I'll try to compare them in practical use the next days.</div>

		<div id="post_message_412494">No i wasnt referring to those items. I was just referring to the numbers. As the stats seem quite similar, apart from the sockets and the haste / armor penetration. <br>
<br>
I have no idea which one is better myself, as i have neither of them. But haste seems to be quite a cheap stat, with a noticeable effect, the usefullness of -armor depends on the mob armor. Nonetheless it will be interesting to see what numbers you can get Svag.<br>
<br>
I doubt flurry gets nerfed next patch. We do around the same damage as rogues ( we're competitive with them ) which is what blizzard intended. Granted some fights we do more, some they do more. It also depends alot on the skill of the player.</div>

Mana spring/tide are nice but not that much of a DPS increase if you already have a shadow priest especially when the fight isn't exceptionally long, however if you're an arcane mage with 2/5 T5 every extra mana you get can be converted into some damage, but probably not enough to be even close to matching up the 8-10% DPS rogues are supposed to get from it and ~20% warriors are (rogue/warrior benefits based on other people's calculations not mine, mage DPS is based on my calculations though).</div>

<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080215185319im_/http://i14.tinypic.com/6h3xz6h.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
Total damage done: 371,405<br>
60% of my damage was affected by haste. <br>
<br>
The boss had 15.79% mitigation (Armor value is wrong, this is somewhere around 2k armor? Lets assume it is):<br>
<br>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080215185319im_/http://i19.tinypic.com/62f4wwg.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<br>
100% of damage is affected by armor penetration.<br>
<br>
The comparision;<br>
<br>
38 haste rating (3.61% haste) vs 175 armor penetration.<br>
<br>
En extra 3.61% haste on 60% of my total damage (371405*0.6=222843) gives me 8044 extra damage (222843*1.0361).<br>
<br>
An extra 175 armor penetration reducing 2000 armor to 1825 on 100% of my total damage gives according to the Armor formula (Armor / (Armor+400+85*(Level+4.5*(Level-59)))) <br>
Reducing mitigation from 14.3% to 13.2% means you deal (1-.132)/(1-.143)=1.0128 or 1.28% more DPS, not 0.8%. (Thanks galzohar for correcting me) 371405*1.0128=376159 damage, 4754 extra damage.<br>
<br>
Clear victory for haste. But 175 armor penetration doesn't equal 38 haste in item budget (I think?). How much does armor penetration cost in comparision to haste?</div>

 I was sort've comparing grips of silent justice and pillagers gauntlets as they  have equal itemisation points ( lv 141 ) and the same kind of stats. <br>
<br>
Nevertheless for -armor to equal haste rating it would need to cost alot less itemisation wise, 2.3x less then haste. I think that shows haste as the clear winner, but it would be interesting for 38 haste VS 175 armor penetration on a low armor boss, like solarian and see if the results are any different.</div>

Teron is as close to tank &amp; spank as it gets in our state of progress, the tank has to have high TPS and should have plenty of rage. <br>
<br>
I used the data in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080215185319/http://forums.wow-europe.com/thread.html?topicId=94319875&amp;sid=1" target="_blank">this thread</a> in the EU forums for my calculations.<br>
<br>
This are the assumptions and simplifications I made:<br>
- Sunder armor is not listed in the WWS parses for some reason, so I just assumed every tank did 5 sunders and sticked to devastate after that.<br>
- I ignored the threat gain from buffs/debuffs like commanding shout/demoralizing shout. They are hard to track in the WWS parses and their impact should be negligible.<br>
- I calculated the passive healing threat in the best way possible for the tank. According to ingame tool tips I assumed healing threat is affected by defensive stance, but not by defiance. I did not split healing threat between Teron and the constructs (since they are "out of phase"), but to be honest it's very likely the healing threat is split in this fight, it was just much easier to calculate it in this way.<br>
<br>
<br>
Anyways here are the results:<br>
<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080215185319/http://img207.imageshack.us/my.php?image=frezytw3.jpg" target="_blank">Frezy, default</a><br>

<br>
To be honest, these numbers seem to be very low, even for me. But on the other hand I double checked everything, so unless I got something fundamentally wrong, or missed something, 1200 TPS tanks are simply a myth, because I highly doubt a shaman will increase your TPS output by 50%.<br>

</div>As you said this spreadsheet assumes <br>
<br>
- 100% rage all the time<br>
- tank does not Thunderclap (which can be ressisted)<br>
- tank does not DemoShout (yet this task can be given to dps warriors)<br>
- misses/dodges/parries<br>
<br>
which is just plain and simple completly unrealistic!!!<br>
<br>
And again there is no such tank&amp;spank fight which would include all those above mentioned points. The very first second you dodge/parry or the mob misses you for a streak of attacks you are rage starved and this cycle is broken and every warrior will agree with me that the skill in TPS is bound to rage and cycleing the skills with the given rage you have.<br>
<br>
So how can you get a real realistic TPS from tanks:<br>
<br>
a) Choose a fight which you think is tank &amp; spank<br>
<br>
For the threat the skills are giving read:<br>
b) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080215185319/http://forums.wow-europe.com/thread.html?topicId=94319875&amp;sid=1" target="_blank">http://forums.wow-europe.com/thread....94319875&amp;sid=1</a><br>
<br>
c) record a fight via WWS<br>
<br>
d) Count the dmg / skills used / healing - threat of your MT<br>
<br>
Then you get a threat number, divide this with the lenght of the fight and you have your real sustained TPS from the MT, and if Ghorms numbers are correct then this TPS spreadsheet is soo off from even comming close to realistic (~400TPS difference) that either:<br>
<br>
1) numbers from b) are wrong<br>
<br>
or<br>
<br>
2) he completly miscalculated it, but i flew over it a bit and it seems correct.</div>

</div>As tank you have to mitigate a lot, it is as important as TPS. If you check out above 3 posted WWS data, Paches is by far the best tank in terms of TPS, but he only did half the amount of shieldblocks compared to Frezy and did not TC at all (which can be compensated with a dedicated TC warrior ofc). I don't want to let this drift off into a "who is the better tank discussion" though. After all our rogues have highest sustained DPS of all in above mentioned 3 examples, and the TPS of our tanks is well enough to kill Teron full out without overagro.<br>
<br>
If you read the thread of the TPS spreadsheet, the author even claims those values to be purely theoretically, which should give you an idea of possible TPS and, even more important, shows the impact of gear changes on your TPS.<br>
<br>
If I find the time next week, I will try to verify, if healing agro is affected by defensive stance or not, already talked with one of our priests how to do it.<br>
<br>
The real question is: are those numbers true? If yes, fury warriors (shadowpriests and ele/enh shamans) might be restricted by the agro ceiling soon. Those guys who claim their tanks are producing 1200 TPS, show those WWS parses, the calculations can even be done with pen and paper. Because either your tanks are doing something completely different than above posted 3 examples, or my calculations are simply wrong =)</div>

		<div id="post_message_413356">1st if you're not taking misses/dodges into account, you really should. Dodges cannot be worked around (aside from weapon skill which you both aren't going to have and it doesn't really change much anyway), and very little tank gear has any hit rating on it. So you're probably going to be running with the full 5.6% dodge 8% miss (I think those are the numbers at least, worth verifying), cutting your 1200 TPS down to 1037.<br>
<br>
Then if nobody keeps thunderclap/demo for you (as far as I noticed picking up TC for a dps warrior is easy but imp demo is not as easy, althogh possible if you really need it so you don't get threat capped ;p). Shouldn't be hard to add those to the rotation if applicible.<br>
<br>
Shield block shouldn't have an effect on TPS beyond some extra rage requirement and the fact it's another thing to look at. It's not on the global cooldown so it shouldn't replace any normal moves you're using, just like heroic strike.<br>
<br>
For mitigation I'm not sure how to really apply this as I don't actually own a warrior, but I suppose you can easily figure out how many attacks in a row you need to completely avoid to become rage starved (2? 1? 3?) and model it with the chance for such a streak to happen. For example if dodging/parrying 2 hits in a row means you don't have rage for the next 2 heroic strikes until you're hit again, and your total chance for being missed/dodge/parry is X, then (1-X)^2 of the time you'll lose 2 heroic strikes. This is just an example of course but you can easily adjust it in the model to reality.<br>
<br>
My saying still stands that if reality doesn't match the theory, either you're doing something wrong in reality or your theory is wrong - but in both cases it's rarely something that cannot be fixed ;p</div>

		<div id="post_message_413379">How much TPS you can put out is very heavily correlated to how much damage reduction your mob has. The TPS spreadsheet defaults to 30%, which is at the high end for a generic raid-debuffed boss mob. It also doesn't account for threat from healing you do with Life Bloom, Prayer of Mending &amp; Earth Shield (all of which, far as I know, get the full Defstance + Defiance bonus), damage done by Spell Reflect or rage gain from Bloodrage, Shield Specialisation and Unbridled Wrath. <br>

The only significant effects there are the overestimation of damage reduction and ignoring of healing, still, it's sufficient to make the spreadsheet underestimate tps severely for certain fights.<br>

As for the Gorefiend parses, my immediate guess would be that Gorefiend has pretty good damage reduction and/or his dps on the tank is insufficient to allow full ability spam. The players presented managed to hit, assuming your assumptions on Sunder use were correct:<br>
<br>
Frezy: 2.97 seconds/instant, 3.03 seconds/hs<br>
Paches: 2.09 seconds/instant, 3.81 seconds/hs<br>
Gordo: 3.37 seconds/instant, 3.19 seconds/hs<br>
<br>
Even accounting for miss, dodge, block &amp; parry all were well below maximum ability spam. Presumably for good reasons, such as debuffs or lack of rage, but nevertheless. I suppose the obvious question is if anyone has seen a tank solidly maintain 1200ish TPS on that fight in particular? If it is a high-DR boss then 800-900 TPS is a very believable value for near-optimal play from a tank that can perform 1100-1200 TPS on a boss that is reduced to near 0 armour.</div>

		<div id="post_message_414528">Hi am sorry if this has been seen previously but figured id ask the question right away.<br>
Am currently raid leading for a guild entering BT and even if the dps warrior spot is already granted am still trying to study which is best for the raid between fury and arms with BF.<br>
<br>
Here are my non theorycrafted pros and cons.<br>
<br>
Fury : <br>
Pros : Higher DPS<br>
Cons : Higher Threat.<br>
<br>
Arms :<br>
Pros : Increases the raid dps even in tank gear<br>
Cons : Lower dps (how much lower is quite the question tho)<br>
<br>
I'd like to know pretty much what guidelines are there between picking the two specs in term of general raid efficiency i guess the 2 important values in the equation are the tank threat if applicable and the physical dps of the raid (atm we tend to run caster heavy).</div>

</div>Without knowing your raid composition, saying "caster heavy" should lean you away from blood frenzy.  There's always going to be a break point at which BF spec raid DPS is higher than the same warrior as fury minus his individual BF spec dps.  You won't reach that break point with only a few melee.</div>

Edit : I realise there is an easy answer, (ie BF becomes superior when 4% of raid physical dps is superior to your dps loss). But however i have a hard time finding out the diff between top arms warriors and top fury (saw some 2k dps vids on warrior favored fights so i guess on those fury &gt;&gt; BF)<br>
<br>
Edit2 : Seems lot of the stuff is being discussed around page 9 for pure theory, just need the "practical" input in hyjal and BT from people who tested both there :p</div>

		<div id="post_message_414926">After reading all this, it does seem possible (especially with haste gear) for imp slam DPS to be high enough that when you add BF to certain raid makeups it becomes better than fury, but it's probably going to remain situational.  For most warriors and the gear they have access to, and for most balanced (i.e. non-melee heavy) raids I feel safe saying that fury is superior.<br>
<br>
Also, as was pointed out, the haste gear does not seem to favor 2h stats, since it tends to have +hit.</div>

<br>
Damage wise i'm coming out about 5-8% ahead of him on most fights....and his spec is somewhat retarded when it comes to PvE dps...no imp slam, no flurry.<br>
<br>
He's got me beat by like 3400 hp, and is crit immune through resilience, so if he pulls agro he can usually survive it...unlike me.<br>
<br>
Starting to wonder if there's even a point to fury, when i can just go MS and PvP well.<br>
<br>
We are 2/6 SSC, 1/4 TK, with Mag down...I've got every piece of gear possible DPS wise except the boots off of Tidewalker, and helm off of VR, which haven't dropped. Getting the gladiator main-hand next week.<br>
<br>
Edit; Came across a lot whinier then i wanted....had an annoying night in TK last night with 3 wipes on VR because healers couldn't keep the MT up...and having the other DPS warrior tank him for like a few % after i got 1 shotted for 19k crit. He continues to insist that he can tank with no problem in that gear, and frequently tanks heroics in it....he also is making no attempt to get "traditional" tanking gear in any way, shape or form.</div>

<br>
I recently switched to Fury from Prot.  Our MT spot is well-covered and after being Prot for my entire PVE career I was just sick of being an offtank.  I had been going Arms for 1 day a week to Arena, but decided on Fury because I thought it was the best PVE DPS build and frankly dual wield is a little more 'fun' than 2h, maybe just because it was new to me.<br>
<br>
My gear was decent to start with, at least coming from Prot, but it was very PVP heavy stuff and still is to a certain extent.  My Chest, Offhand, Legs, Shoulders, Feet and Ranged are all Arena rewards.  Check my profile if you are curious, I know I still have a ways to go with gear but I am getting there.  We have SSC cleared and are working on Kael'thas.<br>
<br>
My DPS is ok.  I can pretty much never beat our best Rogue.  I can sometimes beat the other two, but it really depends on the fight.  Generally I am behind at least one of them, but competitive with them.  I did top the charts at our last Kazzak, and consistently finish top 3 at Magtheridon, but that was all Recklessness.  I dont have an Arms Warrior to bench myself against lately, but I feel like Arms is probably the way to go for Blood Frenzy alone.  I am sure my personal DPS would suffer some but the raid DPS would almost certainly overcome that gap.</div>

</div>The best you can do is make a macro that you have to press for each GCD that you need to use. Ie: once for deathwish, potion, and recklessness. Trinkets don't pop the GCD so you can link your trinket and 1 other thing at the same time. Otherwise you have to either push the same button multiple times, or mulitple buttons once.</div>

<br>
Depending on your raid-setup having Blood Frenzy can be a viable adition.<br>
<br>
To be viable the rest raid has to have 25 times as much physical DPS as you are losing personally.<br>
<br>
So if you lose, say, 100 DPS personally, your raid needs to have 2500 physical DPS total(Rogues, Hunters, Enh. Shaman, Feral Druids, Ret. Palas(not all DPS physical), other Fury Warriors and your MTs) for the respec to be viable.<br>
<br>
As there is no spreadsheet for 2-hand, you have to be going by your own observations of course.<br>
<br>
Additional advantages are:<br>
# less threat for you<br>
# more threat for the MT(s)<br>
# PvP viability<br>
<br>
Disadvantages are:<br>
# less ego boost<br>
# no effect on bleed immune bosses</div>

I've been noticeing spikeing wf procs and crits which isn't all to bad but do mass damage in a short amt of time causing some aggro spikes. I'm gonna admit that being on top of damage meters is pretty hard for me to obtain but I still do about the same percent as everyone else in encounters that is melee friendly.

</div>I believe the wowwiki formula to be accurate, as it is taken from a blue post and I dont remember any rage mechanic changes since that post. When I use that formula it comes out pretty close to in-game observation. Also check your math, when I use your numbers you should be getting close to 15 rage per swing with Deep Thunder hitting for 700.</div>

		<div id="post_message_419210">I've been reading this thread for a long time, I hate to ask a question without large logs, but I don't have links to our WWS atm.  I'm hoping that I'm just missing some blatant hole of logic in the following.  <br>
<br>
My GF plays our teams fury warrior.  Her and I spend a lot of time working through theorycraft to find the best gear for her.  She had been wielding:<br>
<br>
MH: Fel edged Battle axe.<br>
OH: Malkazeen<br>
<br>
Both weapons  have decent dps, good stats and both with mongoose(I know there are arguments here that she should have potency on at least one of those.  I disagree, but thats not what I'm meaning to talk about here).<br>
<br>
Recently she picked up the offhand merciless gladiator sword.  Strapped mongoose on it and has been raiding switching either the axe or malkazeen into the MH.  <br>
<br>
However, since she picked up the sword she has seen a significant drop in her general dps, and in her WF procs specifically.    Is this probably just a string of bad luck?  Or is there something in the stats or speed of the weapons that I'm missing here?<br>
<br>
We want to work more in raids to test it, but she feels bad about bringing down the teams dps on new content this weekend.  We put everything into the spreadsheet, but it doesnt seem to be working atm, at least the one we dl'd which seemed like the latest version.<br>

		<div id="post_message_419212">Depends....dual wield or 2-hander....If you are dual wield, then you need that extra hit if you are only at 150. <br>
<br>
For a 2 hander go for the other stats IMO.<br>
<br>
EDIT: @ Lambach, she needs a slow main-hand IMO. Whirlwind and hamstring spam to proc WF makes up a large portion of our DPS. If she was using mal main-hand, i'd expect her to lose ~45 damage per whirlwind (~5 dps worth) and an equal amount of DPS on each spamstring proc.<br>
<br>
She should have saved up for the Gladiator main-hand and off-handed mal IMO<br>
<br>
Edit2: just checked her armory....her AP is abysmal for fury, especially connsidering the caliber of her gear. I'd suggest dropping 20 hit rating for as much str/AP you can get. <br>
<br>
-Putting potency on the off-hand. <br>
-I'd suggest the choker of vile intent badge reward neck. Minor loss in hit for a HUGE gain in AP, stamina AND crit.<br>
-Switch the helm gem to str/crit, agility isn't a great stat for warriors in general and she's not hurting for hit. <br>
-The meta i don't particularly like...more a fan of 12agi/3% crit damage myself. <br>
-15 str on the gloves 1% more white damage with haste, or 30 more AP affecting both yellow AND white damage...also makes WF hits bigger. <br>
-Get rid of bladefist's breadth for either a bloodlust brooch or hourglass IMO.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I believe the wowwiki formula to be accurate, as it is taken from a blue post and I dont remember any rage mechanic changes since that post. When I use that formula it comes out pretty close to in-game observation. Also check your math, when I use your numbers you should be getting close to 15 rage per swing with Deep Thunder hitting for 700.</div>

Ok, I see one of my mistakes, thank you, but the part i'm confused about is:  Should it be (dam/conversion)*(7.5+(Speed*Factor))/2   or  ((7.5*dam/conversion)+(Speed*factor))/2  or ((dam/(conv*7.5))+(speed*factor))/2?</div>

<br>
The idea is that the rage from damage you do is averaged with a constant based on weapon speed. So <br>
<br>
( ((Damage/Conversion)*7.5) + (Speed*Factor) ) /2 = Rage<br>
<br>
So with your example of Deep Thunder at 3.8 speed hitting for 700.<br>
<br>
( ((700/274.7)*7.5) + (3.8*3.5) ) /2 = ~16.2 Rage</div>

</div>Actually, I don't have Blood Frenzy (another warrior in the raid does). And yes, I was attacking other adds. My DPS was about 2000-2200 all during the add phase, and it dropped to about 1700 as Akama died (trailing the older, much higher DPS). My single target averaged DPS on most fights does not exceed 1300 usually. One thing you have to keep in mind though is that I'm PvP spec. I could easily switch around a few points, put a druid on dps duty (he was tanking adds and out of range to buff me), get a BM hunter, have a rogue expose my target, and have a warlock put Curse of Recklessness on all of them. What you see there was me Cleaving and WWing 2-3 mobs with 0 outside debuffs on them.<br>
<br>
I wasn't trying to imply that Arms is better than Fury. I believe that Fury is superior in most aspects. The one area Arms is going to exceed Fury's capability is multi-target DPS. I suspect that if I can better improve my target selection and get a bunch of debuff bitches; I can easily sustain 3000 DPS, and burst to around 4000. Sadly, this is going to be limited to this fight alone, but it's fun nonetheless!<br>
<br>
Also, I can't really run FRAPS because my computer is really old (I won it at a tournament in 2003). I'm lucky to sustain 20 FPS on most raid encounters. Killing my FPS probably would kill my DPS as well.</div>

		<div id="post_message_420462">Given your current hit/crit levels, you would be better off as 31/30.  Of course you would want a Karazhan or Arena level two hander first.  31/30 is fine, and does "good" raid DPS, but requires Windfury.  DW is simply better but requires a setup that generally takes longer to get.  If you want to go DW, then you need to acquire the gear.  In the meantime just use whatever spec and weapons will provide the most raid DPS.<br>
<br>
There are also many people that argue grabbing Blood Frenzy will yield "higher raid DPS" *in comparision to a similarly geared Dual Wield build*, yet that requires a raid that has an abnormally high amount of physical damage dealers that are all doing abnormally high DPS.  There are also other factors involved such as who is the one using Demo Shout and Thunder Clap.<br>

</div>That statement is completely false, and I'll show you why:<br>
<br>
Let's make up a fake raid against a fake boss with only 5 melee DPSers in it. The fight doesn't matter, only the damage output. I've made up some fake final DPS standings to illustrate my point. The below raid comp would be considered bringing a "small" amount of melee DPS. Most raids run with 1 enhancement shaman, 2-3 rogues, 2-3 warriors (who may or may not be DPSing), 1-2 hunters, a tank on the target, and a Feral Druid. That's 11 people that will be benefiting from Blood Frenzy the entire time in a "normal" raid comp. For the sake of the arguement, I'll only consider 5.<br>
<br>
<b>Damage Done as 31/30</b><br>
Warrior: 300,000<br>
Rogue1: 295,000<br>
Rogue2: 280,000<br>
Hunter1: 250,000 (including pet)<br>
Hunter2: 250,000 (including pet)<br>
Total melee damage done: 1,375,000<br>
<br>
Now, If that warrior respecs, he's going to lose 10% attack speed, which in turn is going to cut down on his white damage by about 10%. Let's throw out a random number here and say that 50% of that warrior's DPS is white damage, or 150,000. He's going to lose 15,000 dmg on the above fight by re-speccing to 33/28. In turn, he's going to gain an additional 4% damage on all his attacks, and another 4% on all of his yellow attacks that make up the other 50% of his total damage done.<br>
<br>
White Damage: 150,000 - 15,000 + 6000 = 141,000<br>
Yellow Damage: 150,000 + 6000 = 156,000<br>
<br>
<b>Damage Done on same fight under same circumstances, but as 33/28</b><br>
Warrior: 297,000<br>
Rogue1: 306,800 (295k * .04)<br>
Rogue2: 291,200<br>
Hunter1: 260,000<br>
Hunter2: 260,000<br>
Total melee damage done: 1,415,000 <br>
<br>
Theoretical Arms DPS Warrior loses 3,000 damage. Theoretical raid gains 40,000. Mind explaining to me why Blood Frenzy requires "an abnormally high amount of physical damage dealers" to see any benefits? <br>
<br>
Looking at these numbers, you'd only need 1 more physical DPS to see an increase in raid DPS by dropping points in Flurry and putting them in Blood Frenzy.</div>

		<div id="post_message_420509">I was comparing DW to 33/28, not 33/28 to 31/30.  That supposed 40k damage that is "gained" from Blood Frenzy would have been "gained" most likely by a solitary DW Warrior just the same without the requirement of every other physical damage dealer being alive and pumping out continual damage as well as making sure dots are up 100% of the time.  I don't doubt that a BF build would outperform 31/30 when all of the requirements are met.  I do not however believe it is "better" than a DW build until a) you are threat capped badly and b) your raids combined physical damage dealers will gain significantly more damage through the debuff than what you lost.<br>
<br>
And if 33/28 is so much better than 31/30 for raid DPS, why are you 31/30 right now?  Is that just your prefered PvP spec?</div>

</div>To be honest, up until now, I wasn't sure. I hadn't bothered to do the math, but I was almost certain that it was worth the sacrifice to get Blood Frenzy. Thanks to my post that was directed at yours, I now have the answer.<br>
<br>
We raid with a large amount of warriors, so we've always had someone with Blood Frenzy in our raids. I've never bothered to pick it up because of that. Also, because I play 2 different characters for our raids, I cannot be relied upon to have it. Instead, I have Imp Demo Shout. A fair compromise, in my opinion.<br>

</div>Contradictory? How so? It's straight-foward information. I wasn't trying to "champion" any spec. You said Blood Frenzy was bad. I say it's good, and I use it. I presented information to back up my claim, where's yours?<br>
<br>
Just because I posted a WWS of me chain-cleaving 4 adds away from everyone else does not discredit the fact that it's better. Would I have done more "raid damage" with Blood Frenzy on my current target and the rogues assisting me? Absolutely.<br>
<br>
My post was simply directed at having Blood Frenzy versus <i>NOT</i> having Blood Frenzy. Obviously, I have the luxury of not needing to spec it. Does that mean I should spec it to further prove my point? No. What's the point of having 2 Blood Frenzy's in the raid?<br>
<br>
Furthermore, Read what you said:<br>

</div>Actually, If I'm the only person attacking the target(s) the majority of the time (and I was), 31/30 would be superior.<br>

You're right though, it is napkin math. But, I could have easily plugged REAL numbers in it. If you can't see that it makes perfect sense even with "fake" numbers, then I guess I can't persuade you further.</div>

</div>Sword spec doesn't change anything.  It's not like slam doesn't proc the extra swings, and it's still the best damage per rage we have.<br>
<br>
Swing/Slam, MS, Swing/Slam, WW, Swing/Slam, MS, Swing/Slam, HS<br>
There is no rotation that can do more damage than that as a 2H warrior, even if your MS is being used every 8s instead of 6.  The closer you can bring your weapon to 2.5s swing with haste, the better it gets.  This rotation also allows you a LOT of time to get pummels off on fights where it's required.<br>
<br>
If you can pull that rotation off perfectly with a 1400 [actual] average white hit damage with a base 3.7s weapon (14s cycle), flurried with windfury (14 attacks that do weapon damage), you're doing at least 1260 single target dps including glancing and dodges.  That doesn't include impale, deep wounds, heroic strike, hamstring damage or the bonus damage from MS and slam.  If Svag can crit for 3k with his main hand, any 2H in his gear should easily have 1400 average white hit damage.</div>

</div>Well that's the case on paper of course.<br>
<br>
Even after downloading quartz swing timer, perfecting this rotation is next to impossible for me. Quartz is not 100% accurate and even 1 messed up slam can cost you a lot of dps. Also keep in mind that you have to be off world cooldown, at the moment where the swing happens, so you can cast your slam immediately, which often is not the case.<br>
<br>
That being said, I did sustain 1100-1200 dps, depending on boss last week (with trying to fiddle in slams). If you add another 40 dps from every other 1k dps physical damage dealer, 33-28 with the right gear is well worth the raidspot at the moment.<br>
<br>
With sword spec and WF using your "free" world cooldowns on harmstings and HS as rage dump simply excludes any lost dps from messed up slams, and every 4th harmsting resulting in an extra attack should be pretty decent dps.<br>

</div>Reducing the cost of HS seems odd considering how Slam is generally agreed to be much better than HS as a 2hander's rage dump. <br>

		<div id="post_message_422113">I'm wondering if a macro can be made that allows you to mash the Slam button, but it will not activate until an auto attack lands before it.  There are similar macros for Hunters with Steady Shot.  It's more "efficient" if you can land the Slam right after the white hit, not 0.5 - 1 second later but it's nearly impossible to ALWAYS land every Slam perfectly, especially on fights where you have to move around a lot.  And Slam is the best damage for the rage because it's not normalized.  Heroic Strike is really awful in comparison for a two hander.</div>

On a more serious note, what really would improve the situation a lot, is a really accurate swing timer. The best I have found so far is quartz, but as stated above it's not 100% relieable as well.<br>
<br>
The best results I get by ignoring the swing timer completely and watching the animations of my alter ego. If i press slam at the very same moment my character strikes out, the slam more or less hits a split second after the white attack. Dunno if this is lag or whatever, but it worked for me. Unfortunately this does not work too well if you stand bunched up with the other melee on the back of a boss.</div>

		<div id="post_message_422362">I just posted this on the official warriors forums. I guess I've been up for entirely too long but I have no idea why the f I didn't come here. Anyways,  I took my alt/new main into her first 25 man raid today and was looking to gain some knowledge about the different rotations used. This character is geared/spec'd for PvP so I know I'm not going to be a chart topping powerhouse, but I'd like to make sure I'm doing everything I can to help maximize myself to the raid.<br>
<br>
I know on my old main, a hunter, shot rotations were key to having good dps. Seeing a hunter just mash his shots and then comparing his dps to a hunter with a tight rotation was like night and day. Naturally I figure it's there's a most efficient way to mash my keys on this character as well.<br>
<br>
One friend suggested a MS, auto attack, slam, slam rotation which I was getting the hang of. Another suggested that MS/WW were on priority. Also, I had windfury so the option of working in hamstring into the rotation came up as well.<br>
<br>
I'm not really in a position to be taking a lot of DPS gear (fury or arms biased) as I've mainly been trying to pick up tanking gear. I have some sick love for tanking, but I have to be able to gear up some more which means I'll be stuck doing DPS for a while.<br>
<br>
In PvP I just bind the right hand side of my keyboard to a MS/hamstring macro and the left hand side to a WW/hamstring macro and beat on the keyboard it does pretty well. I figure there's a cleaner way to DPS in raid settings though. <br>

Has some interesting comments (amid some dribble) about the spec and dps rotations. And while it takes some time, you can find a good number of valuable tips in this thread.<br>
<br>
One suggestion is to get rid of the Alliance trinket, not many times will it be needed for a raid. Secondly, you're specced for PvP so you could better allocate your talents for a raid environment.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">That statement is completely false, and I'll show you why:<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Damage Done on same fight under same circumstances, but as 33/28</b><br>
Warrior: 297,000<br>
Rogue1: 306,800 (295k * .04)<br>
Rogue2: 291,200<br>
Hunter1: 260,000<br>
Hunter2: 260,000<br>
Total melee damage done: 1,415,000 <br>
<br>
Theoretical Arms DPS Warrior loses 3,000 damage. Theoretical raid gains 40,000. Mind explaining to me why Blood Frenzy requires "an abnormally high amount of physical damage dealers" to see any benefits? <br>
<br>
Looking at these numbers, you'd only need 1 more physical DPS to see an increase in raid DPS by dropping points in Flurry and putting them in Blood Frenzy.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</div>I'm trying to persuade our DPS warrior to spec to something <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080220042534/http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=pN0cbAbqM0dZVV0VMgoc" target="_blank">like this</a>, or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080220042534/http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=LG0xkAbqM0dZVV0VMgoc" target="_blank">this</a>. It all calculates out perfectly in theory.<br>
However, he's worried his rage generation will go down a lot because of having 2 points less in "Flurry".<br>
<br>
It is really that bad, or is he just worried for no reason? The damage increase for all the melee in the raid should more than make up for the small ~60 dps that he loses for himself.<br>
<br>
I can't really theorycraft it, since the Warrior DPS spreadsheet seems to be focused on Dual wielding.</div>

		<div id="post_message_422496">@Randor, Yeah, it looks almost like none of the top guilds take a dedicated "Fury dual wield" warrior, they all take 2H warriors for their DPS. Any loss in personal DPS will be made up by Frenzy across the raid. It also solves the problem of Fury's insane agro generation because of using HS as a rage dump by spreading that damage across 5-8 other people.<br>
<br>
Not to mention 33/28 is significantly more PvP viable then 17/44.<br>
<br>
Edit: @Zurgat, 2 points in flurry = 10% less white damage...which makes up ~50% of our damage...so 5% less damage over all. That is made up by doing 4% more damage from Frenzy to almost balance out perfectly. If there is ever a single other physical DPS in the raid, you will see a DPS improvement from 31/30 to 33/28.<br>
<br>
True, his rage generation will be hit, but we are talking something like 6% less rage generation here. That about the difference from going to a T2 to a T3 BS weapon rage generation wise. With windfury rage generation usually isn't a problem anyways.</div>

This is the misinformation that spreads like wildfire, so everyone just assumes that since "DnT" doesn't take a Fury Warrior that BF is superior.  Schmity even posted in the official forums that "I tried out Fury for one night and it's garbage".  An opinion like that is not evidence of anything.  <br>
<br>
Both Curse and Aurora use Fury Warriors, and I'd consider both of them "top guilds".  Look at how many guilds don't bring a single Enhancement Shaman...ever.<br>
<br>
BF is no doubt good, but to just outright claim it's "always" superior is baseless.  It depends mostly on how much physical damage your raids deal as well as how much of a problem you have with threat.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_423214"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->You'd think that after many pages without a clear conclusion, people could agree that it's mostly a preference and setup thing. Aside from Mortal Strike for PvP, there is no clear benefit one has over the other when you look at raid performance. Personally I prefer 33/28 because it's far less "bleeding edge" for threat generation, and also more straightforward to gear. I've always loved DW Fury, but shortly before the new arena season started I specced 33/28 mostly to farm myself some new 1-handers to raid with. The irony! Long story short, it's grown on me and I'll be sticking to it for a while to come.<br>
<br>
By the way, about Slam rotation... when I have excess rage and MS/WW on cooldown, I tend to slamspam a bit until a cooldown gets ready or my rage below about 50. I keep hearing back to back slams are bad, but I generally hit for about as much as I do DPS with Slam alone, noncrit, every second. Considering crits, and WF/Sword procs, that doesn't strike me as bad in any way. Rage generation may suffer somewhat if I get unlucky afterwards, but misses are out of the picture, dodge lets me Overpower, and otherwise I'll at least get enough to Slam again. MS will generally be on cooldown then, anyway. Careless slam spam bad, cautious slam spam good?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_423472"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Been researching some for my warrior and came across this thread.  Hoping to get a concise answer to some Fury/DPS questions.  I was DW Fury all before the expansion and had top-notch gear, spec'd prot to help the guild through its initial raiding forays in BC (my tanking gear is Kara-Gruul level) and am stepping back into the DPS.  However, I have not been part of the DPS game for a while and it looks like some of the rules of the game have changed, especially regarding builds.<br>
<br>
You can checkout my armory profile here:  <a onclick="urchinTracker ('/external/http_armory_worldofwarcraft_com_character_sheet_xml_r_Cenarius_amp_n_Daavlod');" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080407210514/http://armory.worldofwarcraft.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Cenarius&amp;n=Daavlod" target="_blank">The Armory</a><br>
<br>
My short-term plan is to farm the Hourglass of the Unraveller, craft the Tier 1 mace and upgrade it to Tier 2, get the cobrahide for the legs, and enchant both weapons with Mongoose, probably keeping the Emerald Ripper in the OH.  I also have a Gorehowl in the bank.<br>
<br>
Given that information, what DPS build would give the raid the best dps/benefit.  We don't currently have a raiding Arms warrior.  I'd love to stick with DW, but if MS with Gorehowl is the way to go short term, I'm okay with it.  I've also heard our rogues talking about haste like its the best thing since sliced bread and looking at the Swiftsteel craftables and trinkets etc. it does seem like an awesome stat.<br>
<br>

		<div id="post_message_423473"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->the way i see it, BT/Hyjal loot seem to suit DW fury builds better because of haste. with flurry, you are already pushing the ideal attack speed cap for slam rotations. with bloodlust, drums, and mongoose, haste seems almost worthless. <br>
<br>
not only is haste the issue with MS builds, it's the abundant amount of str/ap in highend that favor BT builds more than MS (Cataclysm's Edge, Legguards of Endless Rage, etc). crit isn't seen as much because haste seem to replace it in endgame gear. crit is one of the, if not, best stats for MS warriors.<br>
<br>
if we go the haste route with MS builds, we'd have to change the rotation by removing either MS/WW/HS or Slam from the cycle. removing slam takes away what ms warriors gained from tbc and removing ms/ww/hs will mostly be effective if you slam spam and still manage to get attack swings inbetween the GCDs.  that would happen at about 1.0 speed i think, which will probably not be possible with current itemization unless you throw in the once in a while buffs (bloodlust, trophy, drums, etc)<br>
<br>
i guess the fate of the dps warriors will lie on how itemization goes after BT/Hyjal. speaking of itemization, the threat-reducing trinket from vashj got a stealth buff and reduces a lot more threat from crits, almost making crits feel like normal attacks for the most part. that can help out the threat issues fury warriors have in threat capped encounters. <br>
<br>
i know that you can always pick up other pieces instead of haste gear as MS but that puts a lot of restrictions on your itemization and will restrict your total dps as well. current itemization favors fury warriors so i'm sticking with it for now.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Thanks for the response. It pretty much confirms what i thought.<br>
The reduced rage will also lower his damage a bit then, but still compared to the overall raid bonus it should be very marginal.<br>
<br>
Flurry gives extra hits = extra rage.<br>
But, the extra damage from 'Blood Frenzy' should also produce extra rage, correct?<br>
The only exception would be fights where the boss is immune to bleed. (Void Reaver)<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Not anywhere near George but I can hit just under 2100 with imp Zerker rage before a battle shout. I went with a 20-41 build (Impale and 3 in 2hand specialization) yesterday as we already have a 33-28 warrior. <br>
<br>
I'm still checking the numbers from that raid vs a 31-30 build I tried last night. First impressions were that it did indeed hit harder but with the loss of Axe spec, I did feel the crit loss (37.1% in zerker unbuffed with Axe spec). Damage-wise, it was probably pretty close in the long run.<br>
<br>
I think with about 30% battle stance crit and 2k attack power (before shout) and you can start to see a clear increase in white hits and Slams in a fury build. Will post some numbers once I finish going through the parses.<br>
<br>
If anyone has any number-crunching done, it would be interesting to see their take compared with my first take on it.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I really don't think attack power is the deciding factor here, at least not in terms of gear progression. These days, with stat allocation being mostly uniform from greens through high level epics, attack power and weapon damage generally scale at roughly the same rate, so one won't substantially edge out the other (hence the reason why MS and Bloodthirst continue to be as comparable now as they were pre-TBC). If anything, it's your crit chance that you'd want to consider, if you're comparing an MS build that doesn't include Flurry.<br>
<br>
Fury has always benefited more from raid buffs than MS, but again, that's independent of gear progression.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I'm currently running with the combination of "Dragonspine Trophy" and "Hourglass of the Unraveller", and it feels pretty good. Asap I will replace the Hourglass with the Tsunami Talisman.<br>
<br>
Seen other warriors running around with "Romulo's Poison Vial" for its decent hitrating value, which is also a pretty nice trinket.<br>
<br>
Since most of the mentioned trinkets are Raid-Drops, they are not really farmable. If you have no access to such instances, you may try a combination of the hourglass and some standard +hit or +crit trinkets with an "Increase AP by XXX on use"-effect trinkets.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Technically, yes.  The DPS Warrior spreadsheet was a good thread for mechanics questions before people started asking them here.  It's too late to turn that tide, though, and the original topic of this thread was "not my favorite" anyhow.<br>
<br>
Call me crazy, but I think that posting in proper threads benefits the forum in the long run, as people come back and use features such as "search this topic" or searching post titles; then redundancy is avoided.<br>

<br>
I'm currently using hourglass and bloodlust, but from the math i've seen DST DESTROYS all other trinkets in comparison. We had a tsunami drop on our first ever leo kill...we use a silent bid system and i bid what at the time a guild record high bid...only to see a rogue go all in and snag it offa me with an even larger bid.

		<div id="post_message_429441"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Just wanted to share my experiences from the last few days in relation to haste gear. I bought the swiftsteel shoulders plan and 2 hearts of darkness from the top guild on the server (there goes another 3k gold to em, making over 6k total....at least im financing their raiding, heh).<br>
<br>
I was using the crumby leather shoulders from the chess event upto this point, and i have to say that the difference is STAGGERING. I managed something like fourth on DPS on the SSC trash last night just playing around in battle stance, not really working on my rotation at all. The 40+ ap, and 3% haste has made a noticeable difference in my DPS, and i can't wait to squeeze in some more haste gear when we start getting into BT....i imagine it will be INSANE for our DPS scaling.<br>
<br>
If we are able to work haste into the rest of our gear without sacrificing too much hit, AP or Crit, it will make fury....interesting later on.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>As far as your gear having too much hit, if your going to a 33/28, all you'd have to do would be change your ring to something with less hit on it, and you'd be almost exactly at the 2h hit cap.

</div>I experienced quite the same, not as a request of raidleaders though, but simply the fact we had a couple of BT/HS 2H weapons drop. I sustain 1100-1300 dps on static fights, if you add the BF damage to these numbers, it is quite impressive. If you run with 2 dps warriors at least 1 of you speccing BF is probably a good idea, if you run with only 1 dps warrior I am quite sure that 33-28 is superior in terms of raid dps. (I still miss a decent MH though to try out fury spec).<br>
<br>
I also noticed my dps is kinda "streaky", especially on short fights like gorefiend.<br>
<br>
Gorefiend: <a onclick="urchinTracker ('/external/http_www_lossendil_com_wws_report_bodkhosnygfna_amp_s_102_378');" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081110181624/http://www.lossendil.com/wws/?report=bodkhosnygfna&amp;s=102-378" target="_blank">Wow Web Stats</a> this is our latest gorefiend kill. 1150 dps + ~350 dps from BF are quite ok numbers. A few attempts before, when we wiped below 10% I sustained 1300 dps though. With a slow hard hitting 2H in a short fight the numbers can indeed differ a lot.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

The DPS warriors in my guild are experimenting with 2H DPS also this week.  They're reporting that they are much less threat-capped because they do not have to rage dump with Heroic Strike as much with a 2H build, and thus can do about as much damage as a DW Fury build, if not more.  And the BF debuff is just the icing on the cake.<br>

If the MS warrior gets in the enhancement shaman group with me, he is usually pretty close in damage.  His blood frenzy definitely brings his total raid contribution above mine.

Which means I wasnt either.<br>
<br>
A lot of my gear is PvP now such as Vet stuff and High Warlord gear so as a DPS 2h Warrior what do I need to keep up half-decent DPS?<br>
<br>
So what am I looking for gear-wise and stat-wise for dpsing with a 2hander? (I do have imp. slam which i was using after my normal swing).</div>

</div>Just looking at your gear/spec. the first thing I'd say is get some blue gems in those there sockets! Your under hit cap, but if you could snag doomplate gloves/shoulders you'd be fine there, and trade some resil for more AP/crit as well. Additionally, unless your married to full TM, I'd say drop it for points in flurry, and if you raid a lot, consider even changing second wind to Blood Frenzy, for better personal and raid DPS(Note, if you don't do a lot above Kara BF isn't as worthwhile.)<br>
<br>
Statwise in general, for 2h I tend to prefer a more crit heavy gear set than with fury, but that's sort of a feeling, no numbers to back it up. But get to hit cap! Even if you have to swap in a piece or two of leather or mail, hit rating is by far the most efficient way to improve your DPS until 8.6% or there abouts. Especially if your not running flurry, but even with it.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_432301"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I'm just not sure how to really maximize my DPS.  I've downloaded the warrior spreadsheet and tested a few things out and improved my DPS, but i still seem to be far behind some of you other guys.  I can't really push past 700-900 DPS (depending on the fight), and if I'm lacking lotp/WF, I drop down more. I don't think I'm optimizing my rage usage, but i use a BT/WW cycle with hamstrings in between and heroic strike as a rage dump (or cleave when theres multiple mobs/adds). My gear, compared to the rogues, is not that great considering i've spent most of my dkp on tanking items and just recently respecced fury by request of one of our officers.  <br>
<br>
Am I choosing the wrong stats? Here is my armory: <a onclick="urchinTracker ('/external/http_armory_worldofwarcraft_com_character_sheet_xml_r_Arthas_amp_n_Bsiddiq');" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081110181624/http://armory.worldofwarcraft.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Arthas&amp;n=Bsiddiq" target="_blank">The Armory</a><br>
<br>
Anyone have any advice about how to more effectively DPS? Should I stack more AP and crit? Should I focus on major agil pots, or flasks of RA? I use the str food and sharpening stones. What kind of DPS should i be doing with this kind of gear?<br>
<br>
also, anyone notice BT crit rate being significantly lower than other attacks? my white crit rate was above 30% the other night, but BT crit rate was like 21%. That just seems ridiculously low.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

On Gruul today, with Windfury, I was between 1100 and 1400 dps, which is an increase from 17/44 for me. Not to mention the 4% from blood frenzy for the raid.  I also did that much dps without pulling aggro, something I couldn't do spamming HS for max dps. <br>

</div>Because using Cleave to dump rage is even worse than using Heroic Strike.  Cleave has higher Threat per Damage than Heroic Strike.  So if Hamstring is not dumping your rage fast enough (and it usually isn't), Heroic Strike is your only option.<br>

</div>Yes to all of your assumptions.  Food, flask, sharpening stone, 3 blessings, enhancement shaman.  I also think I used a haste potion when reckless executing.  <br>
<br>
I'm not sure how much armor Anetheron has.  We probably used CoR on that fight, since ranged is usually focusing on the adds.  All of my damage was against Anetheron (no multi-target cleaves or whirlwinds).  <br>
<br>
Also, I don't think I was slept at all that fight, which makes a big difference.  We also used Bloodlust on the boss since we had no problems keeping up with the trash waves.  We had great raid DPS overall, which results in a fast kill where bloodlust/deathwish/recklessness playing a larger factor in total DPS.<br>

</div>I believe my AP sits around 3300 raid buffed without unleashed rage.  I haven't looked at it recently, though, so it may be a little off.<br>

For this kill I was still using a netherbane (2.6) in my offhand.  I only recently picked up the swiftsteel mace.<br>

Here's our latest Gorefiend kill.  I still managed 1414 DPS, but my average white hit was 391 using weapon speeds 2.6/1.5 (closer to your expectations). <br>

From what I can see and even though it feels kind of wrong since you can end up with a full rage bar at times with it, the best thing to do when close to getting aggro is to use all your abilities on the GCD and dump as much excessive rage with HS as you can without going over the limit.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_433790"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->After reading several pages of this, I got to thinking about what I can do with the DPS warrior that our guild runs.  Unlike many of you, he seems to have trouble being competitive DPSwise. We have killed Magtheridon, and we have Gruul on farm, and he is wearing Kara/Heroic gear.  He has tried DW, and 2h specs, neither to much avail.  I will admit, however, that I did not have him grouped with a shaman for his 2h spec, as we have only two in the guild, and one (myself) is speced elemental.  I am going to make a much stronger effort to keep our resto shaman with the melee group for WF after reading some very convincing arguments here. <br>
<br>
Now, onto the true issue, this warrior. The easy answer is replace him, but that is not the answer  I am looking for.  He plays on a rather low FPS machine, or rather very low, so I am sure he is not keeping up with swing cycles, which seems to me to say that he could not do a 2h build very well.  Aside from optimizing his group makeup with a shaman, what should I be looking for as a raid leader to help him perform? His biggest issue is topping threat WAY too early; (says to me he is using Heroic Strike too much, but could I be oversimplifying this?) He ends up ending fights that he should be doing well in the middle range dpswise (8-10, around our lower hunter and moonkin.)<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_433816"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I used to have problems regarding 'Keeping up' with the rest of the DPS classes in my guild.  Dual wield is extremely gear dependent, so as time went on I found that I started to keep up.  I found WWS parses to help a lot too.  I looked at other well known DPS Warriors cycles, and talked to some from my server to see what they were doing differently.  Turns out I was using Cleave over Heroic Strike the majority of the time, and not using Hamstring enough.  A good group set up is always handy (We usually have Me, Feral Druid, BM Hunter, Rogue, Rogue or Shaman if it is melee friendly). <br>
<br>
If you run Paladin light, I found that by taking Blessing of Salvation over other blessings allows me to pretty much go all out on the majority of encounters, except ones with certain mechanics (Voidreaver and Gruul.  And even on Gruul, I just tend to 'chill' for the first growth or so). <br>
<br>
As a raid leader, I would have a little talk with him and tell him to start doing some decent damage, or there is other, better DPS that can take his slot.  Point him to threads here, WWS parses (Even use it yourself to have a look), and make sure his gear is right for DPS (Gemmed and enchanted correctly, priority on the correct stats etc).  Hope this helps.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>As for him, a 2handed warrior without WF will always be rage-starved unless theres some incomming damage gimmick to the fight, otherwise gear might be the issue.<br>
<br>
For the tanks, have them drop avoidance(I know most tanks will spit on me for saying this), We used to have a MT that really stacked avoidance to the max, the result was that even our mages/rogues got really threatcapped, I could barely autoswing. Good thing he quitted playing(I hope you dont read this -.-), and now our new tanks stack stamina, and as a result the raid-dps has gone up alot(For some fights we use ferals for better TPS).<br>
<br>
You could always try throwing an extra shaman to the tanks for more TPS.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_434053"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I'm currently MS, but I would like to respec to fury after getting the arena 1h swords.<br>
Many warriors use a fast offhand, and I wonder why. I just can't see any advantage of a fast offhand weapon over a slow one. But maybe I'm wrong, and thats what I'd like to know. Several points came to my mind:<br>
-Rage generation is normalized.<br>
-Unbridled Wrath is normalized, and I'm not sure if I should skill it anyway (imp demo)<br>
-Afaik a fast off-hand would take more of the flurry swings and therefore I would deal slightly less damage altogether. <br>
-From what I read in other threads most procs follow a ppm mechanic. I would enchant the offhand with 20str or mongoose and I plan to pick up dragonspine trophy and tsunami talisman(hourglass till then), other than that mongoose on the main. Do those trinkets/enchants profit from a fast offhand? As far as I understand PPM, it means speed doens't make a difference. Is that correct? <br>
- We don't have a melee shaman right now, but I hope we will get one soon. So what about wf? Offhand hits don't proc wf, so slow offhand should be no problem.<br>
-Slower offhand also means less swings without heroic strike, hence better hit/swing (but less rage? HS hits dont give you any rage, right? I also dont know if there can be HS effect on offhand swing anyway). Also when HS spamming, I deal less HS overall and so less aggro with a slow offhand(if HS works that way). I'm most uncertain about this point.<br>
-Less offhand strikes also means less offhand crits, so more bleed damage from deep wounds if lucky (ok, thats really not much, i know^^)<br>
-Our guild is far from defeating kael'thas, so i would stick with those arena swords for quite a while.<br>
<br>
So is a slow offhand better? And if it is, is it worth the effort paying double arena points for the slow sword?<br>
<br>
Any help greately appreciated ;-)<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I tend to favor faster offhands over slower ones, all other things being equal. The difference isn't staggering of course, but a faster offhand provides more steady rage generation, especially during the important sub 20% execute range. I like being able to more dependably get an execute off every global cooldown, rather than possibly waiting an extra half second or so. Second, faster offhands get better returns from sharpening stones. +12 to damage makes a much larger difference on a 1.5 weapon than a 2.6.<br>
<br>
In the case of arena weapons, even if slower was slightly better, unless your arena team rakes in tons of points I'd still say go for the faster offhand. Since faster weapons seem to provide slightly better DPS returns, the arena offhand provides a superior weapon at half the cost, a double win.<br>
<br>
Anecdotally, I noticed a marked improvement in my DPS when I upgraded my offhand from a vindicator's brand to an Emerald Ripper. I don't have any solid numbers, but my damage was higher than I thought the 6 DPS upgrade to an offhand should have improved it by.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Although this belief is intuitive, it is false.  Instant-attacks like bloodthirst and whirlwind proc flurry when they crit.  The rate of flurry procs they contribute is static; therefore, if you use faster weapons you will have less overall flurry uptime.<br>
<br>
Another thing to consider is that if your MH and OH have the same delay, I believe you actually gain 4 hasted swings from flurry instead of 3.  Someone please correct me if I am wrong.  Edit: apparently there is already a discussion about using equal weapon speeds for improved flurry uptime: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081110122121/http://elitistjerks.com/f31/t12720-melee_combat_how_does_flurry_work/" target="_blank">[Melee Combat] How does Flurry Work?</a><br>
<br>
I think the ideal scenario is to use equal-speed slow weapons in your MH and OH up until 19%.  At 19%, switch in an equally-awesome fast OH to improve your ability to spam execute.  Admittedly, it's ideal to expect that someone will have two OH weapons of equal quality but different delay.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_435653"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I decided to try out a 20/41 2H DPS build last night. It was hard to get any real numbers out of last night because I was both trying to make new macros, learn when to use my new skills, and I didn't have a feral druid or a shaman.<br>
<br>
My first impression is rampage really isn't that good (not surprising!). Now it might be because I was rage starved without LotP or WF. But inbtween weaving slams if I did have enough rage for something else it was either a choice of BT/WW or Rampage. It just didn't seem like Rampage was worth the spot in my global cooldown.<br>
<br>
At first I tried getting Rampage up fast, and keeping it up. But by the end of the night I realized that I was missing too many BT/WW cooldowns doing this. The only time I can see using Rampage is where my cycle goes slam-BT-slam-WW-slam-BT-slam-(rampage if BS doesn't need a refresh). Seems like Rampage up-time is not going to be very good, and a pain to keep up. Of course Rampage isn't really considered on of the most fun talents in the game.<br>
<br>
I was wondering if a 21/40 build would be better. I decided to go 5/5 2H mastery. I could put a point into impale, which is about a 1.0%-1.5% DPS boost. I wouldn't be surprised if Rampage was a net DPS lose for me last night how I was trying to use it <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20081110122121im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/frown.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":(" class="inlineimg">.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
Its a really weird talent though.  Costs 20 Rage, lasts 30s but you have to get a crit to activate it and then hit the mob to boost its power.  And its on the GCD.  Way overly complicated IMO.<br>

edit: 'really is not good' is too strong of criticism here.  250 AP IS really good for 1 talent point.  I just think the mechanics of maintaining the 250AP are overly complicated.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_436242"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Hi guys, just wanted to post my 2 cents on this topic as it's been the subject of some pretty hot discussion on my guild as well.<br>
<br>
I went ahead and took the plunge into 33/28 (from 20/41) a few days ago, and here are my findings based on a fairly solid DPS-intensive encounter: Teron Gorefiend.<br>
<br>
As posted at <a onclick="urchinTracker ('/external/http_forums_worldofwarcraft_com_thread_html_topicId_443164178_amp_postId_7118688849_amp_sid_1_234');" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080322075215/http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=443164178&amp;postId=7118688849&amp;sid=1#234" target="_blank">WoW Forums -&gt; MS- The new DPS spec?</a><br>
<br>
<br>
<b>So here it is - My breakdown of 33/28 performance in a high-end raiding scenario</b><br>
==============================================================<br>
<br>
I was skeptical of the performance of this spec originally, wary that dropping 10% AP, Bloodthirst, and 2/5 Flurry might come back to bite me in the ass. Very quickly I found out that my presumptions were wrong.<br>
<br>
This post mostly revolves around my most recent raid, notably our kill of Teron Gorefiend.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Skill Breakdown</b><br>
===============<br>
For the first 80% I simply used the normal slam rotation we've become familiar with, breaking from it a handful of times to keep Demo Shout up on Gorefiend. Last 20% was the usual Reck/DW/Execute spam.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Damage Breakdown</b><br>
===============<br>
<a onclick="urchinTracker ('/external/http_www_thinkmaclaren_com_imagedump_meter_gif');" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080322075215/http://www.thinkmaclaren.com/imagedump/meter.gif" target="_blank">http://www.thinkmaclaren.com/imagedump/meter.gif</a><br>
<a onclick="urchinTracker ('/external/http_www_thinkmaclaren_com_imagedump_meter2_gif');" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080322075215/http://www.thinkmaclaren.com/imagedump/meter2.gif" target="_blank">http://www.thinkmaclaren.com/imagedump/meter2.gif</a><br>
<br>
I apolgize for this being broken into two images, I wanted to be able to include the 1st place DPS and unless I've overlooked it these two meters DO show the same numbers for all other places.<br>
<br>
1) Shaitain - Combat Swords Rogue - 472,599<br>
2) Nalladuril - Combat Swords Rogue - 404,249<br>
3) SSlanfear - DW Fury Warrior - 393,654<br>
4) Kiranat (Me) - 33/28 Warrior - 380,525<br>
...<br>
6) Zaidel - Enhancement Shaman - 347,261<br>
...<br>
9) Iccurus - Combat Daggers Rogue - 293,658<br>
<br>
We also have a BM hunter, however if I remember correctly he was one of the first two people to get Shadow of Death.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>DPS Breakdown</b><br>
===============<br>
<a onclick="urchinTracker ('/external/http_www_thinkmaclaren_com_imagedump_gordps_gif');" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080322075215/http://www.thinkmaclaren.com/imagedump/gordps.gif" target="_blank">http://www.thinkmaclaren.com/imagedump/gordps.gif</a><br>
<br>
Fight Length - 303 seconds (5 minutes, 3 seconds)<br>
My Damage - 380,525<br>
<br>
My DPS - 1255.8<br>
<br>
While that on it's own isn't amazing (Shaitain pulling ~ 1550 DPS) let's plug in the DPS gained by all other melee.<br>
<br>
Blood Frenzy adds 4% physical damage taken (by the boss), so let's add that DPS to my own and get an objective scale of the DPS done by a warrior with this spec.<br>
<br>
(((472,599 x 0.04) + (404,249 x 0.04) + (393,654 x 0.04) + (347,261 x 0.04) + (293,658 x 0.04)) + 380,525) / 303<br>
<br>
<b>1508 (effective) DPS</b><br>
<br>
While these numbers aren't quite as amazing as high as those posted about Serida (by Crazypie, page 8) I still consider them rather impressive. Please also note that my spec and weapon are inferior to hers (mace vs sword) though obviously that is not enough to close the 200 DPS gap between us.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Conclusion</b><br>
===============<br>
While 33/28 obviously is not the end-all and be-all of DPS, it certainly brings alot to the table, especially in a well rounded DPS group and in a relatively melee heavy raid.<br>
<br>
In this example roughly 250 DPS was added to the raid's output and my personal damage output was only just shy of that of our fury warrior.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Please feel free to post back about this, ask questions, criticize, etc... I'd like any feedback I can to help better my play style and the DPS of myself and my guild.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

If that's your Fury Warrior I must say that you shouldn't compare your DPS to his as his gear choices and total gear level aren't that good in terms of maximum DPS.<br>
If you compare his gear to mine, you can see:<br>
- I have 48 AP more which are (/w talents) around 22 Strength on gear<br>
- I have 1,26% Crit more which are around 28 Crit Rating on gear<br>
- My main hand has a 212 haste rating for 10 sec. procc equaling around 50 permanent haste rating depending on conditions given<br>
- My trinket has a 325 haste rating for 10 sec. procc equaling around 100 permanent haste rating depending on conditions given<br>
- My other trinket has an activateable 278 attack power für 20 sec. equaling at least a 46,3 permanent AP given the 2 minute cooldown<br>
<br>
- He has 78 more Hit Rating<br>
- His trinket has a 300 Attack Power for 10 sec. procc equaling around 50 permanent AP on average given the 45 second procc cooldown<br>
<br>
For raw values I'd take my gear any day of the week, now you need to add that his weapon choice isn't very good at all as a dagger in the main hand makes your whirlwinds and overpower hit like a wet noodle and that my guild has just downed 4/6 SSC and 1/4 The Eye as opposed to yours raiding Black Temple.<br>
<br>
<br>
@Topic: I was using a Bloodmoon and a 31/30 specc with imp. Slam for quite some time and recently(=last week) got my Dragonstrike and skilled DW Fury (that also pretty much explains my low hit atm). My damage has increased by quite a bit and, maybe even more importantly, I have much more fun playing my Warrior now. Having up all proccs in a Warrior/Rogue/Druid/Hunter/Shaman group I can get some devastating results (and a lot of aggro ;-)).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I think over these fights and most that are very melee unfriendly I held my own as a DPS'er never coming too far behind the fury and when I start picking up some T6 for armour pen I think I will be definately competing for the top warrior (might be a slog to beat our rogues)<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>2 harmstrings in a whole fight when you have a windfury totem is pretty sad, additionally from his buff gains you can see that he neither uses Dragonstrike nor a Dragonspine Trophy, being easy attainable and the best weapon/trinket out there until Illidan.<br>

My gear / setup is ~230 hit, 31% crit, 1850 unbuffed AP (no shout). I have a fully upgraded dragonstrike, and Merciless quickblade (both mongoosed). <br>
<br>
My idea here is that with all of the haste effects that i will be getting (DST / Abbacus / Dragonstrike / flurry / etc etc), i will be pushing that quickblade to a SUPER fast sword weapon, meaning a great increase of overall sword spec procs (since it is a static number).<br>
<br>
From there, with the OH sword being already a ton faster than the MH, i would push that MH to an extra swing just over 1 in every 10 of its swings (which are already a ton faster due to all of the haste effects). Of course, this entire thing would be even better if dragonstrike was a sword, but i work with what i have to work with.<br>
<br>
Anyways, just seeing if anyone has tried this with the type of setup i'm using, and if it is worth losing out on 1 second of WW, imp zerker, and rampage.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
Fight Length - 303 seconds (5 minutes, 3 seconds)<br>
My Damage - 380,525<br>
<br>
My DPS - 1255.8<br>
<br>
While that on it's own isn't amazing (Shaitain pulling ~ 1550 DPS) let's plug in the DPS gained by all other melee.<br>
<br>
Blood Frenzy adds 4% physical damage taken (by the boss), so let's add that DPS to my own and get an objective scale of the DPS done by a warrior with this spec.<br>
<br>
(((472,599 x 0.04) + (404,249 x 0.04) + (393,654 x 0.04) + (347,261 x 0.04) + (293,658 x 0.04)) + 380,525) / 303<br>
<br>
<b>1508 (effective) DPS</b><br>
<br>
While these numbers aren't quite as amazing as high as those posted about Serida (by Crazypie, page 8) I still consider them rather impressive. Please also note that my spec and weapon are inferior to hers (mace vs sword) though obviously that is not enough to close the 200 DPS gap between us.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</div>This isn't a criticism for incorporating Blood frenzy into effective dps, but if you're going to do it for the sake of accuracy your formula needs to be different. It's<br>
<br>
(Sum_others_dmg / 1.04) * 0.04 + Personal_dmg<br>
<br>
Feel free to check my math, I found:<br>
<br>
Sum_others_dmg = 1,911,421<br>
Sum_others_dmg / 1.04 = 1,837,905<br>
(Sum_others_dmg / 1.04) * 0.04 = 73,516<br>
<br>
So total damage you're responsible for is (73,516 + 380,525). Divide by 303 to get:<br>
<br>
1,498 (effective) dps with blood frenzy.<br>
<br>
Not a huge difference, but you have to divide by your multiplier to get back to the base non-multiplied value and then actually calculate with the Blood Frenzy multiplier the accurate number.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
If that's your Fury Warrior I must say that you shouldn't compare your DPS to his as his gear choices and total gear level aren't that good in terms of maximum DPS.<br>
If you compare his gear to mine, you can see:<br>
- I have 48 AP more which are (/w talents) around 22 Strength on gear<br>
- I have 1,26% Crit more which are around 28 Crit Rating on gear<br>
- My main hand has a 212 haste rating for 10 sec. procc equaling around 50 permanent haste rating depending on conditions given<br>
- My trinket has a 325 haste rating for 10 sec. procc equaling around 100 permanent haste rating depending on conditions given<br>
- My other trinket has an activateable 278 attack power für 20 sec. equaling at least a 46,3 permanent AP given the 2 minute cooldown<br>
<br>
- He has 78 more Hit Rating<br>
- His trinket has a 300 Attack Power for 10 sec. procc equaling around 50 permanent AP on average given the 45 second procc cooldown<br>
<br>
For raw values I'd take my gear any day of the week, now you need to add that his weapon choice isn't very good at all as a dagger in the main hand makes your whirlwinds and overpower hit like a wet noodle and that my guild has just downed 4/6 SSC and 1/4 The Eye as opposed to yours raiding Black Temple.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</div>I honestly don't know what he was wearing when you armory'd him, but here's the breakdown of his gear as best I can remember.<br>
<br>
helm - second sight<br>
neck - choked of serated blades<br>
shoulders - t4<br>
cloak - drape of dark reavers<br>
chest - krakken heart breastplate<br>
bracers - bracers of eradication<br>
gloves - gauntlets of martial perfection<br>
belt - red belt of battle<br>
legs - midnight legguards<br>
boots - fel leather<br>
rings - garona's signet ring/mithril band of the unscarred<br>
trinkets - bladefists/hourglass<br>
<br>
weapons (MH/OH) - Talon of Azshara/Tracker's Blade<br>
<br>
stats - 1950 AP, 29 crit, 250+ hit (to my memory, could be slightly off)<br>
<br>
He's got a big hardon (for obvious reasons) for Dragonspine Trophy, but to my knowledge we've had ONE drop in the all times we've killed Gruul.<br>
<br>
Not sure why weapons were reversed in the gorefiend screenshot, though I can tell you that he died at 1% to ghosts.<br>
<br>
Not claiming he's amazing, just pointing out that he's not an idiot :P<br>

</div>I agree that his gear isn't top-notch, but at the same time neither is mine.<br>

In my PVE set I'm still wearing 3/5 Arena 2 gear, and the PVP Neck simply because we haven't seen anything better drop. I also have no gear &gt; SSC level.<br>

		<div id="post_message_437236"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Hello, I was wondering if at any point as a fury warrior it's more beneficial to snag the weapon specs instead of improved berserker stance/rampage?  (For instance, if my crit and AP are both lower than what a beginning fury warrior should have)<br>
<br>
My armory for my warrior is <a onclick="urchinTracker ('/external/http_armory_worldofwarcraft_com_character_sheet_xml_r_Twisting_Nether_amp_n_Ludvich');" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080322075215/http://armory.worldofwarcraft.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Twisting+Nether&amp;n=Ludvich" target="_blank">The Armory</a> and come next week I will have enough to buy a gladiator offhand.<br>
<br>
I was wondering if perhaps a mixed weapon spec such as <a onclick="urchinTracker ('/external/http_www_wowhead_com_talent_pN0xdhwox0zZVVzVoxRV');" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080322075215/http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=pN0xdhwox0zZVVzVoxRV" target="_blank">Talent Calculator - World of Warcraft</a> would benefit me more, while offhanding a 1.5 speed gladiator sword.  (The final point could be put in bloodthirst instead of mortal strike, but since my AP is low they do about the same amount of damage and mortal strike lets me have a bit more efficiency in PvP).  <br>
This would finally boost my mainhand and special moves up to around 29% crit rating, and allow the fast sword to proc mainhand swings with the slow gladiator's cleaver.<br>
<br>
My other idea was to take the points out of sword spec and just offhand another axe (the gladiator's hacker) with a build similar to <a onclick="urchinTracker ('/external/http_www_wowhead_com_talent_pN0xdhiZVVzVoxRVub');" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080322075215/http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=pN0xdhiZVVzVoxRVub" target="_blank">Talent Calculator - World of Warcraft</a> (possibly more in dual wield specialization).<br>
<br>
These may both be farfetched and out there though, however I was just wondering if anyone had tried any similar builds before I spend the respec money and arena points on my offhand purchase.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Doing well does not mean he is doing his best.   No one is suggesting that  he would replace WW with hamstring, but hamstringing while BT/WW are on CD is a better use of rage than HS.   Hamstring assists flurry dropoffs, which can happen no matter how much crit you get, as well as WF, mongoose, and other such procs.<br>
<br>
Hamstring is definately a better use of rage than cleave on single target fights, as it provides 3 extra attacks (proc chances) and 189 damage for 30 rage where a single fully talent cleave adds only +154 and a better hit chance at the cost 20 rage + the wasted swing.   <br>
<br>
I am a bit iffier on talented heroic strike vs hamstring, but I generally find i have enough rage to use hamstring on spare cooldowns and still have some to dump.<br>
<br>
Most interesting about this to me is that hamstring actually scales better with gear in terms of damage per point of rage than either heroic strike or cleave.  As more hit gear is acquired beyond the special ability hit cap the effective hit bonus of using HS and cleave goes down, and as a player's damage increases the amount of rage he spends goes up while the amount of damage a WF proc off of his hamstring goes up as well.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				Hello, I was wondering if at any point as a fury warrior it's more beneficial to snag the weapon specs instead of improved berserker stance/rampage? (For instance, if my crit and AP are both lower than what a beginning fury warrior should have)<br>
<br>
My armory for my warrior is The Armory and come next week I will have enough to buy a gladiator offhand.<br>
<br>
I was wondering if perhaps a mixed weapon spec such as Talent Calculator - World of Warcraft would benefit me more, while offhanding a 1.5 speed gladiator sword. (The final point could be put in bloodthirst instead of mortal strike, but since my AP is low they do about the same amount of damage and mortal strike lets me have a bit more efficiency in PvP). <br>
This would finally boost my mainhand and special moves up to around 29% crit rating, and allow the fast sword to proc mainhand swings with the slow gladiator's cleaver.<br>
<br>
My other idea was to take the points out of sword spec and just offhand another axe (the gladiator's hacker) with a build similar to Talent Calculator - World of Warcraft (possibly more in dual wield specialization).<br>
<br>
These may both be farfetched and out there though, however I was just wondering if anyone had tried any similar builds before I spend the respec money and arena points on my offhand purchase.

</div>From what you're writing you don't look like you're having a clue about Fury Warriors yourself. There's a simple priority system involved in playing a Fury Warrior.<br>
1. Priority: Bloodthirst(6 sec. Cooldown)<br>
2. Priority: Rampage(need to renew every ~27 seconds)<br>
3. Priority: Whirlwind(depending on spec 8-10 sec. cooldown)<br>
<br>
Every Warrior with at least quested Fury equip can keep these abilities on cooldown, and holding these on cooldown you only have a GCD 1,5/6+1,5/27+1,5/10=0,45 meaning 45% of the time. If you don't fill the rest with Harmstrings you're only wasting damage. For example with a standard setup Harmstring can procc Windfury, Mongoose, Flurry and Dragonspine Trophy/Tsunami Talisman/Hourglass with a pretty good chance each.<br>
Heroic Strike is nowhere near the Damage/Rage of Harmstring and so Harmstring should take priority over it. Your Fury Warrior doesn't use Harmstring at all while he's spamming Heroic Strike so he's simply wasting damage he could possibly do.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I'm not talking about getting the talent.  I'm talking about when Rampage is not worth the GCD you spend on it.<br>
<br>
Remember how the original Eviserate (also a non scaling ability) used to be for rogues?   After thier white DPS reached ~160 using it was actually reducing thier DPS.   Rampage is flawed in the exact same way - at some point gear upgrades will make it completely irrelevent.</div>

</div>That is the problem that i find with it. That the benefits of the ability are to small to out weigh spending the rage/GCD somewhere else, the ability provides 250 for 30 seconds after 5 hits, for 20 rage, and uses a global cooldown. I think the issue here isn't the rage or the 5 hits or the 250 attack power, all those things are fine. <br>
I just personally see it that the 30 second period is to short in comparison to the rage/use of a GCD/5 attacks. I would be all for increasing the rage to say 30/35/40 and increasing the period of time to 1min. That would mean that you would only be using 1 GD a minute rather then 2.</div>

250AP is always 250AP but the DPS gained is different for each situation this way ur rampage is "doing" more dps the better ur gear gets. <br>
There are also not that many skills using GCD as DW fury except spamstring whereas it might happen that hamstring &gt; rampage but than u would need insane weapon dmg to make that 1/5 chance to proc WF be better than 250AP for 30sec.</div>

<br>
I don't have the math background to run the theorycraft, but my hypothesis is that in terms of scaling, the AP bonues deep in the fury tree could be offset by the 10% bonus of one handed weapon spec as AP gets higher.  <br>
<br>
Hmm, thinking about it more, this is overly simplistic.  There are many variables to consider, like up time of Rampage, the boost to your BT damage as well as the buff to your white damge from the AP talents, etc.  It would be interesting to attempt to graph this out though and see if there is a point where one of the specs out paces the other.</div>

250 AP adds 17.86 white DPS to each hand and it causes a 2.40 SPD (assuming sword or mace) normalized add to WWs damage.  And it adds 112.5 damage to Bloodthirst.  Always. Gear does not change that in the slightest.   <br>

		</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</div>It's closer than you would think.<br>
<br>
Rough back of napkin math over lunch pizza follows.<br>
<br>
I looked at it over 100 seconds and assumed Rampage was refreshed every 25 seconds and that the first GCD in the 100 seconds was used ot refresh rampage - so we can get in 9 WW and 16 Bloodthirsts in that time.   I based all calcs off using The Decapitator as the main hand.<br>
<br>
Rampage can be looked at additively since AP does nothing more than add DPS.   <br>
<br>
Over 100 seconds 250 AP  adds (I used a 33% crit rate for these calcs)<br>
<br>
4750 White DMG <br>
513  total dmg added to the 9 WWs<br>
1800   total dmg added to the 16 BTs<br>
<br>
7657 total dmg added by rampage over the course of 100 seconds.  Note:  I didn't not figure in the damage added to WF procs from normal hits and spamstring.  I need to figure this in when I have more time.<br>
<br>
vs.<br>
<br>
Using slam with a Decapitator and assuming 3000 AP and 33% crit rate<br>
<br>
5297.7  Damage if we used slam for those 5 GCDs we'd have used on Rampage.<br>
1172.4  DMG on average for the additional WF proc those slams would create.<br>
<br>
6470.1  DMG done using Slam instead of Rampage.<br>
<br>
Now this is admittedly incomplete math - I don't account for the DPS Ramapge adds to normal melee and spamstring produced WF procs over that 100 seconds in the first set of calcs.   Also it doesn't account for the impact on DPS that using slam will have vs. using Ramapge (which doesn't affect the swing timer).<br>
<br>
But the numbers are closer than I would have thought.   And given that 3000 AP and Decapitator are from current end game standards I wouldn't be surprised at all if it's possible for warriors to reach a gear level where, no matter how sloppy they are with the swing timer and slam, that replacing Rampage with slam is the way to go beacuase while the slam numbers will only go up as your gear gets better the DPS 250 AP adds will always be the same.</div>

<br>
It lacks how much dmg u would gain with more hit / less hit etc... <br>
Extra procs like my dragonstrike and dragonspine trophy + Hyjal/BT haste items would add a lot more white dmg with extra 250AP than GCD used on slam/hamstring. <br>
<br>
Last time i did recap parsing about month ago my white dmg was at around 63-65% of total dmg. It probably went higher now since i got dragonstrike/dragonspine to around 70-75%. <br>
<br>
Will do some parsing later when we go to SSC.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">From what you're writing you don't look like you're having a clue about Fury Warriors yourself. There's a simple priority system involved in playing a Fury Warrior.<br>
1. Priority: Bloodthirst(6 sec. Cooldown)<br>
2. Priority: Rampage(need to renew every ~27 seconds)<br>
3. Priority: Whirlwind(depending on spec 8-10 sec. cooldown)<br>
<br>
Every Warrior with at least quested Fury equip can keep these abilities on cooldown, and holding these on cooldown you only have a GCD 1,5/6+1,5/27+1,5/10=0,45 meaning 45% of the time. If you don't fill the rest with Harmstrings you're only wasting damage. For example with a standard setup Harmstring can procc Windfury, Mongoose, Flurry and Dragonspine Trophy/Tsunami Talisman/Hourglass with a pretty good chance each.<br>
Heroic Strike is nowhere near the Damage/Rage of Harmstring and so Harmstring should take priority over it. Your Fury Warrior doesn't use Harmstring at all while he's spamming Heroic Strike so he's simply wasting damage he could possibly do.</div>

</div>You're forgetting very large factors in heroic strike's damage.<br>
<br>
1: It will never miss with more than 8.6% hit.<br>
2: Never glances.<br>
3: 20% crit damage bonus from impale.<br>
<br>
The benefit to using heroic strike over hamstring in the priority isn't the 186 extra damage it does, it's the three points I outlined above.</div>

<br>
Some points:  <br>
1.  You don't always have windfury but you could potentially always have rampage.<br>
2.  I've never even tried slam spam as DW.  I have switched to a build built around stance dance overpowering to add another instant attack.  The loss of rage is almost irrelevant and you get fairly regular dodges when you attack frequently.<br>
3.  10% more 1 hand damage is partially matched by 10% more ap.  Then, rampage merely has to match 10% of your weapon damage its self.  This is where 180 dps one hander comes from.  This does not count the loss of any other top fury talents.  Obviously, 30 pts in prot would result in better tank prowess.<br>
4.  Without spamstring and factoring in 1 OP every 20 seconds, I'm at roughly 60% of the GCD cap.  Depending on latency, you can approach the GCD cap, so a well thought out cycle/approach has a reasonable amount of GCDs to keep rampage up.</div>

What do you 33/28(or 31/30) warriors do when you get Bloodlust pre 20%?<br>
<br>
Sometimes my guild likes to stack lusts into the melee group and this gives me problems.<br>
I do the standard (white-&gt;slam, ms, white-&gt;slam, ww, etc) rotation but this all goes to hell in a handbasket if I get lust early as my auto attack timer drops to 2.2. I tend to simply fall into mashing ms/ww/hamstring and then popping in heroic strike when my rage gets too high but this seems very clunky and not the best use of the hasted time. Is it better to forgo ms/ww/hamstring completely and just time slams for after the auto attack swings?</div>

</div>Actually I didn't calculate Heroic Strike damage at all so how can I forget large factors in it?<br>
I know the arguments you did there, but there are contra-arguments as well:<br>
1. If you have good equip your point number 1 doesn't make a big difference at all.<br>
2. It causes a large portion of extra aggro you should try to avoid.<br>
3. It costs tons of rage as it stops your mainhand from generating rage.<br>
<br>
I just wanted you to know that not using Harmstring at all is bad for a Fury Warriors DPS every way you look at it.<br>
<br>
@Kaos: When I was 2h I switched to a simple Auto Attack/Slam rotation because the casting time of slam is being reduced as well and it's more rage efficient than spamming MS/WW.</div>

		<div id="post_message_438688">Using hamstring when possible is nice, but it's never for me an either or proposition with heroic striking. With an enhancement shaman and a WF totem, I can HS quite frequently anyway, and have the rage to keep BT/WW/Rampage on cooldown, and toss in hamstring when my GCD is free. On some fights I end up with as little as 30% white damage due to being able to heroic strike so often. (Yes, of course replace a lot of those HS with cleave on some more aggro sensitive fights like Gurtogg, Void Reaver, etc.).<br>
<br>
As far as avoiding HS due to threat, that's generally a non-issue. I can sustain 1600 DPS on a fight without pulling aggro consistently. A good thing on many fights is to have your shaman use TA totem for the first 5% or so of a fight to let the tank gain a good threat cushion on you. But our tank doesnt even generally have WF, and I have few aggro issues, so I don't see why people are saying hamstring and heroic strike are mutually exclusive at all. Yes, I hamstring when I can, but I use HS a hell of a lot more times over a boss fight.</div>

</div>He just means what priority each move has, such as if whirlwind were going to be usable again about half a second earlier than bloodthirst, you're still better off waiting for bloodthirst to come up, using it, and then using whirlwind instead of postponing your bloodthirst for 1 second due to the global cooldown after using whirlwind.</div>

</div>I do it that way.  Plus putting 1 pt in Imp WW puts it on 9 second cooldown which is a nice even multiple of the 1.5s gcd.<br>
<br>
If you want to do the lazy fury warrior's easy DPS method get a G15 keyboard and create a macro with your skills in the following order (presedence)<br>
<br>
Victory Rush<br>
Bloodrage<br>
Execute<br>
Beserker Rage<br>
Whirlwind<br>
Bloodthirst<br>
Hamstring<br>
<br>
And you'd probably want to create one without WW in it for those times when AE is bad.</div>

</div>I was running 1/2 imp WW for a long time because of this, but I found that WW and BT were still coming off cooldown during the same GCD. I assume this was minor lag, resulting in my cooldowns being slightly longer than the global cooldown, but I can't say for certain. I had to respec to prot for a bit, and when I went back to fury I dropped the point in imp WW to see how it played out in actual raiding, rather than the pure theorycraft.<br>
<br>
Has anyone else had they're cycle get messed up due to small amounts of lag? I'm talking ~150ms or so, what I thought was a small enough amount to not screw up a warrior rotation.</div>

And that's with 2% more +hit from talents than a warrior. But while they are limited by energy, a warrior has no problem with rage and is limited by cooldowns and threat. <br>
<br>
So is stacking that much hit rating less effective than stacking AP/crit? Does how much hit rating is optimum depend on how much TPS the tank is generating?<br>

You can easily update the spreadsheet yourself, just add the items you need to the relevant sheet (if the items doesn't get into the selection lists you can insert rows in the middle of the item list if you don't know how to edit the selection lists).<br>
<br>
The -AC mechanic is not in the list since that will depend on the AC of the mob, which is not modeled in the sheet. It should be fairly easy to include.<br>
<br>
Ask in the sheet thread, maybe someon has done an upgraded version.</div>

		<div id="post_message_441375">I've been running into an issue with my itemization.  I recently picked up all of the trash drops available to me in BT and my crit rating is suffering.  Choker of Serrated Blades, Swiftsteel Shoulders, Pillager's Gauntlets, and Band of Devastation all have attack power and haste or armor penetration, but no crit.  I've had to re-gem my gear with crit over hit but it still isn't making up the difference.  I'm sitting at ~25% crit in zerker stance with 213 hit rating, 1802 attack power (as fury), 175 -AC and 131 base haste rating.  <br>
<br>
Basically I'm asking if the haste rating and armor pen. is worth it.  I'm not very excel-savvy.. so I don't think I can update the warrior spreadsheet on my own.  QQ<br>
<br>
In a raid environment, I always have an enhancement shaman and feral druid in my party.<br>
<br>
In regards to the sundering mobs subject, trash usually dies too fast for me to stack more than 3 sunders, so I just BT/WW with my GCDs.</div>

</div>As a general rule of thumb I would suggest the Pillager's for DW and Silent Justice for 2H MS/Slam.  Haste stacks great when dual wielding with flurry and bloodlust.  <br>
<br>
However, 2H MS/Slam should aim for a slow (3.7/3.8) weapon and not be stacking haste.  Having a longer weapon delay allows you to more easily weave instant attacks (MS, WW) and slam in-between auto attacks due to the global cooldown.  Our MS warrior noticed a significant difference in when upgrading from a 3.6 to 3.7 speed weapon and has since decided to avoid haste gear and focus on other stats.<br>

				<strong>2H Rotation with Heroism/haste potion?</strong>

		<div id="post_message_442672">A few weeks ago I was lucky to get my hands on <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304145014/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=29993"><span  ><span class="purplename">[Twinblade of the Phoenix]</span></span></a>.<br>
<br>
So I decided to go with 33/28/0, and I'm quite happy with the results so far, sword spec combined with windfury is just great. <br>
I run the normal [auto, slam, special, repeat] rotation. But when I get Heroism or use Haste Potions I'm not sure what rotation I should run. <br>
<br>
My weapon speed is following:<br>
1. Speed 3.13 with Flurry.<br>
2. Speed 2.41 with Heroism.<br>
3. Speed 1.74 with Heroism &amp; Haste Potion.<br>
<br>
So I was wondering what the best rotation would be to run in scenario 2. &amp; 3.? At the moment I either run a rotation where I skip a slam [auto, slam, special, auto, special, auto, repeat] or [auto, slam, auto, slam]. I'm not sure what rotation would be best or if I should consider a rotation with spamstring?<br>
<br>
Hope you got some advice.</div>

		<div id="post_message_443153">I agree that haste can throw your rotations off, but I don't agree that getting a slower weapon necessarily means it's automatically going to be better.  The main thing a slower weapon will generally have is just a higher min and max than a faster as well as getting a bigger benefit from the non normalized AP for Slam.  Go for whatever weapon will do the most DPS all around, not just what is slower.  Having haste with a 2h just means your timing is going to be off sometimes with a Slam.  If you have better timing than most, having haste isn't a bad thing.</div>

</div>I don't have access to -AC items, but here's what I would do since this is asked far more often than good answers are apparent.  Grab <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304145014/http://files.wowace.com/MobMitigation/" target="_blank">MobMitigation</a>.  Use it for a bit until you have a good idea of what a relevant level of mitigation is on the bosses that you raid against.  IIRC, it has an "estimated armor" field.  So, with that, you should be able to use the armor formula to determine what % increase in damage you will see from a -AC item and compare it to damage increse from Haste, AP, etc.</div>

The drawback of it compared to Arms is mainly the lack of Blood Frenzy and the power of Arms in AoE situations.<br>

It also depends a bit on what the best weapon available to him is, in the short perspective. Also I might've overlooked some aspects of the differences between the specs so anyone feel free to correct me.</div>

</div>Blood Frenzy seems to be the new flavor of the month bandwagon build now.  Many, if not most DPS Warriors in SSC+ raiding guilds initially were Fury, and I don't know if it's just some of the comments people have read from certain Warriors in some of the top guilds have said that caused this sudden explosion of "Blood Fury is the best" or what, but it's silly.  <br>
<br>
Blood Fury is reliant on how good the physical damage of the rest of your raid is.  If you bring many high DPS Rogues and Hunters, then it's probably going to be better for your raid than what a DW Fury build would be.  It also depends on your own level of gear and how much you find yourself threat capped.  I'm sure when people are in BT gear, threat is more of an issue than ever before, plus the two handers are so good that you are going to be doing similar damage to what you could do pre BT DW, if not more.  If your raids are typically caster heavy and you aren't seeing weapons like a Soul Cleaver yet, Blood Frenzy is probably not going to make up for the DPS you will lose switching to a 2h build, which while still competetive, isn't quite as good for overall raid DPS.  It also depends on whether or not you have a second Warrior there to TC/Demo for the MT.  Blood Frenzy also does not add "4% more threat" to the Warrior tanks, regardless of what some other Warrior might claim.<br>
<br>
It's all situational depending on how your own guild operates.</div>

</div>I think itemization really had me lean towards slam. There is three 130dps weapons that are all raid viable. That frees up Rising Tide, Blade of Infamy and the multiple maces for the rogues/enhancement shaman and in turn makes the raid a stronger group IMO. A few drops down the road I may consider going back to fury but at the moment I'm really more interested in the fastest progression our guild can achieve.<br>
<br>
On a side note after playing fury from MC-Nax I think it's fun to try a different build.</div>

</div>So am I, and we are not yet in Hyjal, having Vashj and Kael left.  And right now, the itemization isn't really there to make such a sacrifice.  I could craft a T3 2h weapon or simply grind one in Arena, but not only do I find it more akward to DPS with a 2h, we typically have four physical damage dealers that are outputting a lot of damage, with a smattering of others here and there that bounce around depending on what space there is in a more optimal group as well as the fight.  There isn't any weapon I would want from SSC/TK, and not too many others want any weapons from there either when you compare it to what they already have from S2.  The only possible exceptions would be Vashj's dagger and bow.<br>
<br>
As I said, it's all dependant on your own guild's situation.</div>

</div>I think this is one of the key issues for the future of DPS Warriors.  It appears that the ability to do higher and higher DPS may become less important than the ability to lessen threat.  It's pointless to do more damage if you can't do it without pulling aggro.  2H may ultimately be less raw DPS than DW Fury, but if it can deliver high DPS with a lower threat ceiling, then it's much more useful.</div>

</div>Yes but there are things your tank can do to help there.  There are things your raid leader can do to help your tank via group setups.  More Tank DPS=higher threat ceiling.<br>

Anyways, I think a lot of warriors are leaning towards 2h build for several reasons.<br>
<br>
1. Less obvious threat, from less DPS and less HS spam.<br>
2. Don't have to re-spec for PvP/PvE arena games, and still maintain MS<br>
3. Easier to rationalize your raid spot to guild leaders if you bring 4% more physical DPS as well.<br>
4. Itemization is HEAPS easier. PvP gear is an excellent start for 2H gear, and you don't have to focus on hit virtually at all. Not to mention crafted 2H weapons are....Incredible to say the least.<br>
5. It seems to be FotM for the big guilds. DnT's DPS warrior is 100% MS/Slam specced, as are a lot of the other big warrior names....people are sheep, what can you say <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080306080632im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/rolleyes.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":rolleyes:" class="inlineimg"><br>
6. WAY less competition on gear. I'd imagine 2H weapons aren't fought over at all for BT guilds (I got my world breaker for like 100 dkp...T5 pants went for 700+ on the same kill). No need to steal "Rogue gear" for more +hit.<br>
7. Less jokes about being a plate rogue.</div>

</div>From SSC on Fury was viable and does great dps. Lots of gear has 30+ hit on it and you don't even have to socket every item with +8 hit gems. The non-plate of fury overlaps with rogues/hunters a bit more then with 2h's. (1h's, Shadowmoon Destroyer's Drape, rings etc all overlap....) After almost zero plate pieces in Karazhan blizzard has placed a large amount of plate dps items in every zone. All three trees are viable.</div>

</div>Going to have to disagree with your first point. I'm actually seeing much more positive results swapping to a 33/28 from a 17/44, and not for lack of gear. I have no statistics to show for this statement on hand sadly though.<br>

The rest or your points are pretty spot on and insightful, particularly number 7.</div>

I do think it's a good idea though, because BF's apparent purpose was to make an Arms warrior worth bringing to raids, but they just utterly neutered Arms DPS with the WF change, so it's really a rather pointless talent now, beyond 4% more personal burst in PvP.</div>

You either take the plunge and be the debuff bot while enjoying your PvP, or you spec full fury for DPS, as it should be. Having the one spec to rule them all was silly.<br>

				 Ok, all. Here's a bit more for you all as far the reasoning why this fix wasn't in sooner and to clarify that this also is intended to affect Slam:<br>
<br>
With the release of The Burning Crusade, we had intended Windfury Totem to only work with normal auto-attacks and “on next swing” abilities such as Heroic Strike and Cleave. We uncovered the reason this fix did not work, and it was corrected with the Windfury Totem hotfix this week. At this time, Slam is intended to not work with Windfury Totem. We have no plans to return it to working with Windfury Totem.<br>

We just weren't as clear as we would have liked in our original statement so hopefully this clears things up for people a bit more.

		<div id="post_message_447009">With the new WF change, I am facing a dilema.<br>
<br>
Because instant attacks no longer proc windfury, there is no difference in windfury damage between a fast or slow MH weapon.  <br>
<br>
Overpower, Whirlwind, and Cleave will still benefit from a slower MH weapons.  Heroic strike +hit bonus also benefits a slower weapon more, since the +hit bonus you gain from it being a special attack produces less TPS on a slow weapon.<br>
<br>
However, using two fast weapons (1.5) of equal speed is tempting me with a few advantages: <br>
<br>
1) This will provide 4 hasted swings instead of 3, increasing white damage and rage<br>
<br>
2) Better execute damage (However, I can always swap the faster weapon in at 19%)<br>
<br>
3) <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080310205252/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=30621" target="_blank">Prism of Inner Calm - Items - World of Warcraft</a> will benefit more from faster attacks.  Currently I am still using a fetish of the sand reaver with 2.6/1.5 speed weapons.  With two 1.5 weapons, I will have 1/3rd more MH swings, increasing the use of the threat proc.  Previously, I've found the fetish to be more valuable because it is front-loaded and can be paired with cooldowns.  <br>
<br>
4) With the WF nerf, spamstring is less valuable.  It can still improve flurry uptime, but the WF proc is gone.  This means more rage spent using heroic strike, and a 1.5 speed weapon can dump it more quickly than 2.6 in situations where threat is not an issue.<br>
<br>
Let me know what you guys think.<br>
<br>

</div>Probably better now that the <i>main</i> reason to even use a slower weapon was removed.  You're going to get slightly smaller WF hits from a weapon like that mace, but you're also going to be getting a few more per minute as well as having a much smoother rate of incoming rage.  Faster main hand weapons were always superior when threat was not an issue and rage was free flowing (but how many fights are there really like that?).<br>
<br>
The only time I could really see the mace being "bad" now would be in situations where you are needing as much AE damage through cleaves and whirlwind as possible.  So in effect, this is another "Weapon normalization" happening.  Haste has a larger effect the slower the weapon, but when considering a weapon like that, you'd have to do the math to show it's "bad" compared to a slower, same DPS main hander.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_449159"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->You could simply cut out a ton of threat by never using Hamstring (180) and even Heroic if the weapons are truly that powerful.  You would end up with a lot more white damage, more Windfury procs within the same amount of time.  Although if you are having to give up abilities to use a weapon, you may as well just let a Rogue have both and stick with whatever weapons you had.  While a Warrior could put them to good use, I don't believe we would be able to output as much damage as a Rogue would simply due to not having Feint or Vanish.<br>
<br>
The Prism is not the answer to our threat issues, although I'm sure it has it's situational uses, it's not an all around great trinket I would always want equipped.  It would also be much more useful with faster weapons.  You would be doing less overall damage per crit over a slower weapon, but more crits within the same amount of time...which would mean more of a bigger threat reduction for about the same damage.  So yeah, I guess the Prism would be good with the Glaives, but the Glaives would be better with a Rogue if you had to go that route.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Probably better now that the <i>main</i> reason to even use a slower weapon was removed.  You're going to get slightly smaller WF hits from a weapon like that mace, but you're also going to be getting a few more per minute as well as having a much smoother rate of incoming rage.  Faster main hand weapons were always superior when threat was not an issue and rage was free flowing (but how many fights are there really like that?).<br>
<br>
The only time I could really see the mace being "bad" now would be in situations where you are needing as much AE damage through cleaves and whirlwind as possible.  So in effect, this is another "Weapon normalization" happening.  Haste has a larger effect the slower the weapon, but when considering a weapon like that, you'd have to do the math to show it's "bad" compared to a slower, same DPS main hander.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</div>The primary other issue I'd have is that it significantly downranks your Deep Wound ticks, but those aren't a huge portion of your DPS anyway (especially once you start getting a high-stacked crit rate, and Deep Wounds will continually chain-reapply itself before actually dealing any damage). It does also provide less damage-per-threat when combined with Heroic Strike than you'll get with a slower weapon.<br>
<br>
Still, it's by no means that horrible to use two fast weapons with the new WF change. Synched weapons, oddly enough, also got a huge boost - Windfury used to desynch the weapons when it procced, but now they'll both swing in unison, leading to effectively four charges of Flurry per crit instead of three.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>WF procs on instant-attack swings shouldn't modify the attack timer at all, since it's resetting the swing timer from 0 to... 0. If there's a bit of lag before the game recognizes the proc, sure, but it should in theory stay perfectly synched.<br>

</div>Interesting. Have you considered not using Heroic Strike? It produces increased threat out of proportion to the damage output it provides, especially at your current hit rating, and it might let you sustain Windfury longer. Point for point, if you're going to be threat capped anyway you should probably simply forgo Heroic Strike and possibly even Hamstring and just push as much possible damage without taking the increased threat modifiers on those abilities, even if it means sitting at 100 Rage quite for a lot of the time.<br>
<br>
Also, have you tried using the Prism a few people have mentioned in this thread? On that WWS you provided you got 193 Critical Hits. Using the Prism, that should erase 28,950 damage worth of threat (converting into threat numbers is worthless, as the threat reduction on the Prism is also reduced by Salv/Tranquil Air/Battle Stance), which would be about 5% of your overall threat output ignoring the bonus threat from Heroic Strike (so, perhaps 4% is the better number). Not by any means an ideal solution, but far better than having to scale down damage.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Why would you get 3 points in 2h spec and then 5 points in dw spec? <br>
Those points would be better served in parry or imp rend for all it matters. <br>
<br>
Secondly, the loss of Rampage, improved execute and imp zerk stance cannot possibly be made up for by sword spec. <br>

</div>Does your group's DPS loss (unless you are were threat capped) justify the gain of your personal DPS? You should stop using Cleave as it's worse than HS in terms of threat. It's generally better to simply stop using specials instead of using Cleave/HS/Hams since they have innate threat modifiers. Also, ask Hamsterboat why he didn't execute at all (unless he was dead the last 20%).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>The spreadsheet models these, iirc.  If not, that thread would have been a better place to ask for gear advice.  Alternatively, it's not hard to work out the differences in those two based on gear.  You probably know your crit rate, and % damage from crits.  The skyfire diamond is ~1PPM.<br>

Illidan Post: Waiting for WWS recorder (DUKES PULL FINGER OUT) to upload the parse<br>
<br>
To sum it up I felt like I was never a threat on threat (oO) except obviously on bloodboil where its just a warriors job to bite it @ 10%, if I didn't crit on my white autohit I found myself getting rage starved, windfury attacks actually suprised me when they happened and weren't part of my damage anymore. Personally I hate it, before the nerf I felt arms dps was a very niche skill, it took a lot of timing co-ordination and ability to be able to pull off a high sustained dps over a fight and when you did pull it off you felt good.<br>
<br>
Now I look at my damage and i'm pretty ashamed, dropping down from top 5ish most the time to around 10th, i'm thinking of giving this dual swiftsteel bludgeon spec a try if they ever drop for us again, as I don't think the dps I lose as arms now is any longer justified by the 4% blood frenzy debuff, or I could just reroll a lock!<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_450595"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Hey guys,<br>
This is a bit offtopic from where the thread currently has led itself(hate teh WF nerf...), however I have some questions for a lot of you fury warriors.  How do you guys deal with "rogue" weapons?  (I.E.  Slow MH daggers, swords, and fist weapons, and very fast OH weapons.)<br>
<br>
Recently its come up in our guild and created some rogue drama.  As GM I see both sides of the story and was wondering how other guilds deal with it.  <br>
<br>
Rogues:<br>
Rogues are committed to one spec that favors one spefic type of weapon.<br>
Rogues face a much higher dps increase from a slow MH, fast OH.<br>
Rogue instants are based on MH dmg<br>
With the WF nerf a slow MH isnt as important for a fury warrior anymore.<br>
<br>
Warriors:<br>
Still participate just as much in raids<br>
Are still expected to bring huge dps numbers<br>
Provide rogues with battle shout(yeah, its their job, but figure I'd list it)<br>
<br>
<br>
So I was wondering how other fury warriors deal with "rogue weapons".  Do you guys mainly look for maces and axes?  Do you pass swords to sword rogues and daggers to dagger rogues always?  Does the rogues attendance and history with the guild come in to play at all in your decisions?  And are these personal views or guild loot enforced rules? <br>
<br>
Thanks for your answers.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Why exactly, because of WW and Cleave?  Faster is much better for Heroic Strike, and while yes, "threat" is our primary limitation, spamming Hamstring was producing a ton of threat for really good gains when you used a slow MH, but this isn't true anymore.  Haste will have a larger effect on a slower weapon, but does that necessarily mean there will be a significant difference in overall DPS compared to a faster weapon?<br>

		<div id="post_message_451530"><!-- google_ad_section_start --><i>Dual</i> Bludgeons would be an interesting choice for sure.  Take the Rising Tide for example.  To get it to the 1.5 speed (discounting the 2% haste making it 1.47), you would need approximately 73% haste.  25% of that can come from Flurry (although it will not be up 100% of the time), so you would have to make up (over) 48% haste somewhere, most likely a combination of a static haste rating, Dragonspine proc and Mongoose.<br>
<br>
The Tide with 73% haste will get 17 additional auto attacks per minute, whereas the Bludgeon would gain 28 (if it's possible to actually swing below 1.0 speeds, otherwise it gains 20).<br>
<br>
Using 4000 generic AP:<br>
<br>
@1.5 speed the Rising Tide outputs an additional 17,051 damage per minute<br>
@0.87 speed the Bludgeon outputs an additonal 16,240 damage per minute<br>
@1.0 speed the Bludgeon outputs an additional 11,600 damage per minute<br>
<br>
Clearly the Rising Tide puts the <i>haste</i> to much greater use.  How easy is it to get 73% continual haste though?  Also, the gap between the .87 speed Bludgeon compared to the 1.5 speed Tide would most certainly be eclipsed through Windfury procs as well as a lot more Heroic Strikes.  It's not so apparent with the 1.0 speed Bludgeon.<br>
<br>
Let's look at this again using a more accessible (for non BT clearing guilds) 40% "constant" haste.  Yes I realize you have to actually be in BT to get either weapon, but that's not the point.<br>
<br>
@1.86 speed the Rising Tide outputs an additional 9,030 damage per minute.<br>
@1.07 speed the Bludgeon outputs an additional 9,265 damage per minute.<br>
<br>
This is just the increased damage from auto attacks.  If someone wants to take the time to find out the additional damage per minute each weapon at each speeds gains from Windfury as well as Heroic Strikes (assuming no rage starvation or threat limit) they can.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I've seen someone say before that slow weapons benefit more from haste than fast weapons, but why? If you got x% passive haste, then your white dps is increased by x%, regardless of the frequency it's created with. So haste should yield similar returns for slow weapons and fast weapons.<br>
<br>
The argument that faster weapons benefit more from the extra attack power of windfury is invalid, as extra attacks through Windfury are not normalized as far as I know.<br>
<br>
So what makes a difference in weapon speed choice is whirlwind favoring slow, vs. cheaper and more heroic strikes favoring a fast mainhand. Or did I miss something?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>The difference in those numbers arises mainly from rounding errors in your calculations. Having done the same with some more accuracy, I arrived at a difference of only a bit over 3 damage per minute (probably still due to rounding). Same holds for the other example in your post. <br>
<br>
As said in the post before, haste and weapon speed have no synergy with windfury at all any more. It's true that for procs with a static proc chance, haste yields a bigger return in procs for faster weapons, but this effect should be marginal at best.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Yeah, I'm going to chalk this one up to simply being tired.  That, and having this screwed up idea that somehow the additional AP was being factored in as some seperate damage source instead of simply adding it to your base AP before weapon speed is considered.  <br>
<br>
So in the end it seems to come down to bigger WW/Cleave/PPM vs steadier incoming rage and more efficient Heroic Strikes.  I'm not sure how much of a real difference this would be, but it seems like you might have the potential for less glances with fast/fast.  If rage was not an issue for some reason and you could Heroic each swing with a slower weapon, it would end up being the same, yet less threat.

				<div style="font-style:italic">So in the end it seems to come down to bigger WW/Cleave/PPM vs steadier incoming rage and more efficient Heroic Strikes.  I'm not sure how much of a real difference this would be, but it seems like you might have the potential for less glances with fast/fast.  If rage was not an issue for some reason and you could Heroic each swing with a slower weapon, it would end up being the same, yet less threat.

</div>Two things about this. With a slower weapon, you'll make much more damage non-glancing per (threat intensive) Heroic Strike than with fast weapons. And more focus on HS works against the prism bonus of using two fast weapons. With Salvation, Heroic Strike extra threat is fairly close to the aggro reduction of the prism on crits.<br>
<br>
I'd add some practical experience if I could, but before I try Fury again I need another weapon.

		<div id="post_message_451853"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->In the past week I've spent some time with my weapons I posted before (2.6, 1.5, 1.5).  I've observed that my DPS is still higher with fast/slow after the Windfury nerf.  I've put some more thought into the theory behind it that I explain below.<br>
<br>
<u>Heroic Strike impact</u><br>
With the slow MH you get more our of your heroic strike.  Here's why:<br>
 <br>
1) The bonus from impale (+10% total dmg on crit) gets more bonus per rage/threat with a slow weapon.<br>
2) Heroic strike increases the chance to hit.  This gets bonus per rage/threat with a slower weapon.<br>
3) Heroic strike cannot glance.  This gets more bonus per rage/threat with a slower weapon.<br>
3) Heroic strike increases damage by X.  (Edit) "The damage-per-threat and damage-per-rage" is independent of weapon speed.<br>
<br>
Reasons 1-3 make heroic strike with a slower weapon more rage and threat efficient.  If you are in a situation with no threat limitations and plenty of excess rage, a slower weapon will allow you to use bonus (4) much more quickly.<br>
<br>
<u>Whirlwind</u><br>
Whirlwind is still 4% of my damage with a slow MH.  Using a fast MH can almost cut that damage in half.<br>
<br>
<u>Flurry-benefit per instant attack</u><br>
Slow/Fast (2.6/1.5) has an average attack speed of 1.025 sec/hit.  Fast/fast has an average attack speed of 0.75 secs/hit.  An instant attack that crits (BS, whirlwind, hamstring, execute)   will generate Flurry.  The flurry will last longer with slow/fast.<br>
<br>
During execute phase, it's important to generate rage as fast as possible between the global cooldowns of execute, so fast/fast is clearly the superior option.  Heroic strike and whirlwind are not used.  Bloodthirst is still more dmg/rage efficient than execute and is weapon speed independent.<br>
<br>
Using slow/fast (2.6/1.5) from 100-&gt;20% and fast/fast (1.5/1.5) from 19%-&gt;0 has given me the best results.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Yeah, with Dragonspine and Dragonstrike I can imagine getting enough haste for that most of the time.  In the end, we're essentially only talking about optimizing a few tenths of a second per execute.  I'm sure the marginal benefit of improving this is pretty small.

				<div style="font-style:italic">Yeah, with Dragonspine and Dragonstrike I can imagine getting enough haste for that most of the time.  In the end, we're essentially only talking about optimizing a few tenths of a second per execute.  I'm sure the marginal benefit of improving this is pretty small.

</div>Void reaver is a special case because of the threat reduction on the knockback.  <br>
<br>
I was lucky enough to pick up a <a onclick="urchinTracker ('/external/http_www_wowhead_com_item_21647');" class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080411072741/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=21647" target="_blank">[Fetish of the Sand Reaver]</a> back in AQ40.  It's still extremely effective at reducing threat if you pair it with bloodlust/deathwish.  However, only find it necessary in a few fights.  In SSC I use it for Leotharas and Lurker.  On void reaver, the entire melee group should get tranqil air and threat shouldn't be a problem.  In Hyjal/BT I only use it on Bloodboil and RoS.  <br>
<br>
I would recommend looking for a slower mainhand weapon for the reasons I listed in my earlier post.  Also I would make sure that the tanks are getting chain mis-directed during the fight and that the tank is playing correctly.  You should only be having threat issues on a few fights, some of which are done so by design.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>IMO if you are pulling aggro on VR with just 840DPS your tanks are the problem, assuming you have Salv.<br>
<br>
How many tanks do you have fighting for aggro?  When we have 3 good ones, I wont pull aggro.  We have actually done it with just 1 tank before and I obviously had troubles then, but not until the very end.<br>
<br>
Our MT has really gone out of his way to work on threat, mixing gear up when he can afford to, and it really, really shows.  Of everything we have killed, I can go balls out (again, assuming I have Salv) on pretty much every fight except Gorefiend.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
I know the Void Reaver fight has some aggro mechanics that tend to make the fight more quirky, but I will suggest my Shaman drop TA totem next time to see if it will help. It would actually be nice to use my trinkets and Deathwish for once. Chain Misdirecting is also a good idea, I'll ask our resident Hunters to give it a try next week.<br>
<br>
Hozz: We usually have three tanks for that fight, and they all do a good job at holding aggro. It just seems that when VR winds down below 15% or so, the threat starts to get a little bit funky. Same with Morogrim. <br>
<br>
I would really like to start using Insane Strength and Haste pots on a regular basis for boss fights, but I am afraid of the consequences. <br>
<br>
What about ability rotations? Right now I am saving rage for Bloodthirst and WW, then dumping extra rage into HS if I have over 60. Should I just be dumping that rage into Hamstring instead for extra Flurry procs?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

here's the rub, though: A lot of those were while tanking, so I was using a fast mace to mortal strike with. None of this is really enough to be conclusive or even prove the proc rate is definitely above 25%, but is it possible it might be a PPM proc that only goes off on mortal strikes?</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic"><u>Heroic Strike impact</u><br>
With the slow MH you get more our of your heroic strike.  Here's why:<br>
 <br>
1) The bonus from impale (+10% total dmg on crit) gets more bonus per rage/threat with a slow weapon.<br>
2) Heroic strike increases the chance to hit.  This gets bonus per rage/threat with a slower weapon.<br>
3) Heroic strike cannot glance.  This gets more bonus per rage/threat with a slower weapon.<br>
3) Heroic strike increases damage by X.  This is independent of weapon speed.<br>
<br>
Reasons 1-3 make heroic strike with a slower weapon more rage and threat efficient.  If you are in a situation with no threat limitations and plenty of excess rage, a slower weapon will allow you to use bonus (4) much more quickly.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</div>I disagree with point (4) (<i>labeled wrongly as a second (3)</i> ) of yours.<br>
The <b>flat </b>heroic strike bonus favours fast weapons.<br>
<br>
The lessened miss chance, non glancing and impale work on fast weapons the same as they do on slow weapons, as they effectively modify your DPS value and do not favour fast or slow weapons. The point you make though and which I want to emphasize again: heroic striking with a slow weapon applies the main benefits (non glancing, less "miss") to a greater portion of your total damage (see it as a granularity thing).<br>
<br>
Keep in mind that in exptreme cases (think Loatheb pre BC) Heroic striking with a fast weapon will produce way more damage than a slow weapon. At a heavy cost though: it  produces a ton more aggro. <br>
<br>
If rage and aggro is an issue, heroic striking with a  slow weapon is better. I agree there.<br>
<br>
EDIT: On second thought, I'm not so sure that heroic striking with a slow weapon is prefered in low rage situations. "Slow" means the benefits apply to a greater portion of your damage, but it also does amplify the "hidden" rage cost of a Heroic strike, as more white damage is lost from generating rage.<br>
Would that not leave only the "less aggro" as a benefit of using slow weapons for a heroic strike?<br>

</div>That's how I see it.  Clearly a static damage modifier is going to do more damage if it's being applied many more times due not only to speed but efficiency in cost.  As it was previously stated though, this will output a lot more threat over a much slower weapon.  If you are on a fight where threat is not going to be an issue, you would probably do better with fast/fast.  On any threat limited fight, you would be hampering your potential damage dealt greatly.  Same theory applies to putting a Thunderfury in your off hand.  Simply shutting off attack isn't the solution.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I will edit my above post to clarify point #4.  In terms of pure DPS, heroic strike can obviously be used faster with faster weapons.  I was focusing my list on damage-per-rage and damage-per-threat.<br>
<br>
The opportunity cost of your heroic strike swing is proportionally the same for a slow or a fast weapon because the hidden benefits it provides (+chance to hit, impale, no glancing) are also proportional to weapon speed.<br>
<br>
The hidden benefits from heroic strike with a 1.5 speed weapon cause 73% more threat and cost 73% more rage than with a 2.6 speed weapon.  Without flurry, if 50% of your swings in a minute were heroic strikes, it would cost 132 rage and 2420 threat for a 2.6 weapon (11 swings).  It would cost 240 rage and 4400 threat for a 1.5 weapon (20 swings). <br>
<br>
The net difference is that the dagger produces 1872 more <b>base</b> damage for 1980 threat and 108 rage.  <br>
<br>
The only benefit of using heroic strike with a faster weapon is to gain the +damage bonus quickly if you have no threat or rage concerns.  An earlier poster is correct--the only encounter in the game where this is the case is probably Loatheb.</div>

</div>This does fail to take into account the hidden rage cost of Heroic Strike, though (i.e costs your next autoattack swing worth of Rage). Assuming 3010 AP (divides evenly!) and 100 DPS weapons, your overall DPS is going to be 315. With a 2.6 speed weapon this works out to 819 damage pre-armor, and with a 1.5 speed weapon it works out to 472.5 damage pre-armor. As for the rage that you'd gain from these hits...<br>
<br>
Zero-Armor<br>
2.6 - 819 Damage: 819 / 73 + 2.6 * 1.75 = 11 + 4.5 = 15.5<br>
1.5 - 472.5 Damage: 472.5 / 73 + 1.5 * 1.75 = 6.5 + 2.5 = 9<br>
<br>
10% Armor Reduction<br>
2.6 - 737 Damage: 737 / 73 + 2.6 * 1.75 = 10 + 4.5 = 14.5<br>
1.5 - 425 Damage: 425 / 73 + 1.5 * 1.75 = 6 + 2.5 = 8.5<br>
<br>
20% Armor Reduction<br>
2.6 - 655 Damage: 655 / 73 + 2.6 * 1.75 = 9 + 4.5 = 13.5<br>
1.5 - 378 Damage: 378 / 73 + 1.5 * 1.75 = 5 + 1.5 = 6.5<br>
<br>
So to rerun your numbers in the same scenario, the 2.6 speed weapon loses 11 * 13.5 additional rage and the 1.5 speed weapon loses 20 * 6.5 additional rage.<br>
<br>
This puts it at 280 rage and 2420 threat for a 2.6 speed weapon at 11 swings, and 370 rage and 4400 threat for a 1.5 speed weapon. While I believe you were trying to use the same % of swings so as to avoid calculating Impale and the +hit modifier, it is interesting to see the results when you compare them for the same Rage cost (since, presumably, your overall rage generation is much the same no matter what). At 15 swings, the 1.5 speed weapon costs 180 + 97.5 = 277.5 Rage, and will generate 2940 bonus threat.<br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong - using a quicker weapon is undeniably worse in this situation, since for the same rage cost you're generating around 21% more threat and receiving a considerably smaller +hit/Impale bonus, but it is a little bit closer than the situation you described.</div>

What about critical strikes? What about glancing blows?  I believe this is an oversimplification of the opportunity cost.  If you assume that both weapon speeds generate the same rage over time, then 30 seconds of heroic strike should have an equal opportunity cost for both weapons.  <br>
<br>
I have not spent much time analyzing the rage formula but my assumption was that it was independent of weapon speed.  Please correct me if I'm wrong.</div>

</div>Curious. I have no idea how that happened, although my suspicion is that rounding error crept in and multiplied, since I was using the NapkinMath version of the rage formula and truncating/rounding some decimals.

</div>Im wondering the same thing, as well as how haste rating now compares to -armor and other stats now with the new formula, but this is a pretty huge blow for alot of things, DST will now only give about 20% compared to the old 30%, wonder if it will still be the top dog or not. these melee nerfs hurt pretty bad to be honest, the windfury one hurt 2h hugely and now this will also hurt as well.</div>

<br>
Some of my values might be a little off, but it's a comparable rate of return with haste being slightly more preferrable and both only modify white damage.  An additional point is that you can cap hit and not haste.  When looking at passive haste items, I keep this in mind for comparison as I have a general idea how much I value +hit.<br>
<br>
Additionally, given the amount of rage that is attainable in a boss encounter, has anyone done any in depth comparison to using an imp OP/TM build (12/46/3) that would let you fill out the fury tree a couple points more and stance dance overpower (for significant rage usage) to cycle in a third instant attack without threat modifier?  Give ~5% dodge, you get dodges fairly regularly and being able to OP every 20 seconds would not be unusual.  I've been playing around with the warrior dps spread sheet and while it is not as high in pure DPS as an impale build, the threat savings from overpowering instead of HSing are significant.  Deep wounds doesn't do much when DWing as an offhand crit tic isn't very powerful and you frequently have it refreshed before it tics.  Hmmm.  I need to get some prot warriors back active in my guild so I can go back to DPS.</div>

		<div id="post_message_459696">Kind of a change of direction here....but this has been bugging me for the last couple of weeks. Hopefully my rambling doesn't sound too whiny.<br>
<br>
Reading through a couple of posts from other threads, and the results of the Wind fury, and soon to follow haste and mace spec nerf, I've started to question what Blizzard's intentions are for a "DPS" warrior. Most of the nerfs were to bring T6, dual legendary wielding, rogues in line with caster DPS, but the side effect was a rather severe hit to fury and a brutal nerf to Arms/MS damage in a raid setting.<br>
<br>
The quote from earlier was something to the following effect. "Rogues, Mages and warlocks do a lot of DPS because that's all they can do. DPS Warriors have less DPS because blizzard thinks they can tank (with a respec, and change of gear)....". Then it went on to talk about how, because hybrids could do more, they did each job less then optimally.<br>
<br>
Basically, that strikes me as a weak excuse for us not putting out competitive DPS. The last 2 weeks have seen me drop from first place on lurker, and a solid top 5 on every other SSC boss to 5-10 on most bosses. The crowning moment of my DPS career was last night, when our priest class leader decided to bring his alt Warlock (in heroic and 2-3 kz epics) into Gruul and our Void Reaver kill. He beat me on every single boss, and easily kept pace on the trash. It seriously made me question was i was even in the raid if a T4 quality warlock can put out more DPS then a T5+ DPS warrior can...All i brought was a battle shout to the rogues, which could have been handled by our second prot warrior being put in the rogue group.<br>
<br>
Even moving into BT in a few month, I don't see a few hundred more AP, hit and crit making up for, or closing the gap on what our top DPS is putting out NOW, let alone when they are T6 geared as well.<br>
<br>
And with Dual Wielding Death Knights on the horizon....I'm seeing less and less of a future for a DPS warrior. Are we just supposed to be content with "average" quality dps? Is that our new place? After having tasted the best pre-TBC, and even pre-WF nerf, it's really hard to swallow being second rate.<br>
<br>
(Background; we are working on Vash'j, You can look me up on the armory, but short of a DST, Tsunami talisman and T5 DPS pants, I've got just about all the available gear from farmed content)</div>

<br>
Until two weeks ago I was 33/28 MS myself.  The Windfury change was very drastic to the feel of my particular spec (which focussed on Slam).  I ended up DW fury and find that the WF change doesn't seem too harsh in that regard.  I was just crafting and stacking haste when news of that change hit as well; now I wear 4/5 Tier 5 + armorsmithing BP and find that it works better for me than the haste I had been wearing, simply because my crit is so much better and my flurry/rampage uptime more consistent.</div>

<br>
We have almost identical gear, but i edge you out by about 2% crit (I assume you are in zerk stance anyways) and 180 AP. Although i assume you have a bloodlust brooch instead of a riding crop for DPS :P</div>

<br>
Cloak : <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304072904/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=24259"><span  ><span class="purplename">[Vengeance Wrap]</span></span></a> with +8str = 68AP / 23 crit / 2hit, better than those 3 (but zero stamina)<br>
<br>
Head : T5 &gt; Felsteel, you have -9 hit and -8 crit, but more strength. With +24AP diamond and <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304072904/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=24054"><span  ><span class="bluename">[Sovereign Nightseye]</span></span></a> you get 42 more AP<br>
<br>
Chest : You're right, Bloodsea brigand is much better than krakken, either with 3x +8str gems or 2x +8crit and 4str/6stam for socket bonus<br>
<br>
Legs: T5 are better than Arena2, more Str and hit for a little less crit. You can also get <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304072904/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=29950"><span  ><span class="purplename">[Greaves of the Bloodwarder]</span></span></a> on solarian, more Str too but less hit rating.<br>
<br>
Rings : ranger general is good, for the 2nd, I think <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304072904/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=30738"><span  ><span class="purplename">[Ring of Reciprocity]</span></span></a> (kazzak) is better than lethality<br>
<br>
Ranged: the shuriken is not bad, but vashj's bow got 38 AP and 16 crit rating (post patch) and if you want hit rating arcanite steam-pistol got +19 (and 20 agility)<br>
<br>
edit: DST is a realy good trinket, and <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304072904/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=30446"><span  ><span class="purplename">[Solarian's Sapphire]</span></span></a> is a good one too, +70AP on BS, affected by Commanding Presence it's +87.5 AP for your party</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Cleave is more threat per damage than HS; it is also more rage per damage.  HS is much more threat/rage efficient, just know when to back out and not overaggro.<br>
<br>
Edit: Unless, of course, you're actually hitting two targets with your cleave.</div>

</div>For most players this is true, but it is not necessarily the case at high levels of gear.<br>
<br>
<b>Calculating the threat/damage by only considering +damage bonus</b><br>
<br>
Heroic strike adds 176 damage for 196 threat. That is 1.1 threat per bonus damage.<br>
Cleave adds 70 damage for 130 bonus threat. That is 1.8 threat per bonus damage. <br>
<br>
<b>Consider the other bonuses of heroic strike and cleave</b><br>
Compared to an autoattack, both Heroic Strike and Cleave:<br>
1) Increase chance to hit because it is a special attack.<br>
2) Increase critical strike damage due to impale<br>
3) Cannot be glanced<br>
4) Add some "bonus damage" (176 for heroic strike and 70 for cleave before mitigation)<br>
<br>
<b>Re-calculate the threat/damage if you include the additional bonuses of a special attack</b><br>
For example, let's say that "removing glancing blows and reducing chance to miss" increases the expected damage of an attack by 200. This is rough number based on my calculations from a WWS log on Anetheron.<br>
<br>
This changes your calculation as follows:<br>
<br>
Heroic strike adds 176 damage (+200 for hit/glance) for 196 threat. 1.92 damage/threat<br>
Cleave adds 70 damage (+200 for hit/glance) for 130 bonus threat. 2.07 damage/threat<br>
<br>
Here, cleave is the victor. If you can calculate the value of these other bonuses (no glance, +hit, +10% crit damage), THEN you can calculate what is better damage per threat.<br>
<br>
Heroic strike will always be higher DPS and damage-per-rage if you are not threat limited.  Cleave can be more damage-per-threat if you are hitting very hard.</div>

		<div id="post_message_462458">I just cleave dump on the feral target because he generally positions himself to swipe 2 targets (if we need 2 melee targets tanked on one tank, he generally get it).  So when I cleave dump, the damage return is significant (2 targets).  Also, his positioning will generally let me WW whereas our warriors will generally stand next to sheep (not being the TC addicts I was when I was tanking) so I can't ww.  That leaves me BTing and putting up a lot of HSes.  In general aggro is still not a problem if I have salve.<br>
<br>
For those 2 MHs, isn't the Phoenix clearly superior?  35 (crit/hit) + 48 ap is 59 well used stat points.  Azhara is 53 stat points used fairly well (crit would have been better than agil) with the difference put in as armor which is more or less useless.  Same min/max/spd.  This is assuming you are not sword specced.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I agree with most of your choices, although i'd take destroyer pants over mericless for a couple reasons.<br>
<br>
Str &gt; Sta IMO.<br>
Socket it with 10 str (I buy my gems from a BT guild on our server for 200g each)<br>
Merciless is just.....nubby. Showing dps gear with PvP epics in it kinda makes you look like a scrub in my opinion.<br>

Also, Talon of the Phoenix is being buffed in 2.2, so it might be better then Azshara.<br>

</div>Yeah, I was the MT until last week, when we decided i'm going to go fury because we have too many tanks in the raid, and now we've got a Druid MT for most of the bosses, and 2 prot wars, and a prot paladin. so my gear is kind of meh atm. I Just picked up the Merc Glad OH last night with some arena pts, and the t5 pants indeed are a big upgrade, but alot bigger for many people, though I should not of said that anyways, i'll just take it into consideration when it drops.<br>
<br>
I'm assuming if talon of the phoenix is being buffed, azshara would aswell? because aren't they of same ilevel?</div>

</div>Yeah, I chose the shuriken because we have 3-4 hunters that prob want those ranged weapons. but i'll keep that in mind. <br>
<br>
thanks for the great advice, i've only been fury about 5 days now.. <br>
<br>
Okay, so the t5 is actually better for several slots, I'll have to keep that in mind when we do loot, as usually 50-60% of our raid is wanting Defender, and they drop about 20% of the time.. gg dbl champion.</div>

25.5% missed<br>
5.6% dodged<br>
25% glancing with 35% reduction<br>
15.7 Haste rating = 1% haste<br>

<br>
<br>
See post 383, but the conclusion was that the base miss rate was 9% against a 73rd level mob, +19 if you DW, for a total of 28% miss chance base. 443 hit rating total to attain hit cap unless I'm mistaken.</div>

See post 383, but the conclusion was that the base miss rate was 9% against a 73rd level mob, +19 if you DW, for a total of 28% miss chance base. 443 hit rating total to attain hit cap unless I'm mistaken.</div>

Wicked Edge/Dragonstrike &gt; Anything in SSC, and most in TK, right?  I don't know any serious warrior thats not a BS. <br>
<br>
Strange trend on the last page of this thread where people are getting +hit weapons and +hit trinkets. Are we trying to compensate for the WF nerf?  Because warriors more than any other class benefit from +crit more than +hit so I really can't imagine a time I'd ever want to use Romulo's over Hourglass.  You don't need to hit to crit in melee, and if you keep flurry up you're 30% more likely to get a WF proc in that span of time.<br>
<br>
The only thing I'd trade for +crit is AP, but even then its a sliding scale. I've personally found +crit to be #1 until about 35% crit, because at a certain point 220% dmg needs to be multiplied off a decent AP.  However this is anecdotal and I could just be feeling the effects of getting gear thats overall more powerfull (such as not trading crit for AP, but getting both).</div>

I'm starting from 30% base and often work with a feral druid.  Tack on kings/mark, maybe a stone, and fairly frequent mongoose procs and that puts me into the 40s.  The flurry up time at 38% crit is about 85%.  The flurry up time at 44% is something like 90%.  I'll probably try to get my hit back over 200 for more white damage, more WF procs, and better execute spam performance.  I find it easier to manage my rage the less I'm prone to missing.  I hate when I hit 60 rage, queue a HS and pop a BT and then wait 4 seconds to hit again to continue my cycle with WW.  I don't use any hit trinkets or items specifically for hit though I do have 2 hit gems in some older gear from when I needed hit.  I doubt I'll ever gem for hit again.</div>

</div>You have hit gems.  You are using PVP gear to DPS (armor pieces) and you bought a PVP offhand while maintaining an 87 dps mh?  T4 DPS pants were bad last I saw them, but Bladespire Warbands would be an upgrade.  Gauntlets of Martial Perfection are probably better itemized than your gloves.  Perilous Neckpiece would probably grade out over your neck.  How high are you getting on dps?  Given that as DW you basically only have 2 short CDs to weave, it's not a brain surgeon cycle.  If you are playing well and being out dpsed, you are just being out geared and/or beaten by classes that are higher DPS.  You will gain more DPS per upgrade than most classes.</div>

<br>
I'm usually in a OT role in my guild (moving on to SSC/TK still), but sometimes I get a Blood Frenzy debuffing/rogue buffing role. However, without a WF totem in my party, I can barely surpass 500 DPS - with it, I can get around 650 DPS, more or less (tested it on Gruul, so it might be off a bit). I'm thinking these figures are a bit low, but with my current gear (mostly lvl 70 blues with s2 shoulders and heroic mecha legs, using Despair - around 28% crit, 1500 AP, and not much hit at all.. 4 or 5% I think), I'm not really sure how I can get it higher.<br>
<br>
Without WF, I'm most of the time rage starved so I can't use slam effectively - with it, I can, so the DPS is a bit better. I'm thinking my gear has something to do with it - should I try to get some leather gear from Karazhan?<br>
<br>
By the way - on a completey unrelated note, I was thinking (well, economy classes....) about making a simulator as well, but modelling some things (mongoose, death wish and etc) are a bit hard to do. Do you guys just do it like - X ppm with a Y sec duration, with no cooldown, so it's X*Y/60?</div>

only thing that will make your dps higher, since the 'cycle' is really so small<br>
is just your gear and your spec.<br>
<br>
i noticed a large increase when i went from kings defender offhand to merc glad offhand before the raid too.</div>

The tanks between parses also have similar numbers, in fact ours are currently using pretty grounded avoidance ratings by comparison for smoother rage generation, aswell as more hit and SBV.<br>

-Improved Berserker stance/Unleashed Rage check box<br>
-Commanding Presence/Solarian Sapphire check box would change Battle Shout AP<br>
-Imp. Heroic Strike, DW Spec, Anger Management, Impale, Deep Wounds, and so on...<br>
<br>
-Input mob armor rather than % reduction and add a armor penetration box.<br>
-Mongoose<br>
-Input length of fight, maybe then execute could be modeled as well<br>
<br>
And to be really nifty a report at the end with a breakdown of things like actual crit rate, % of total damage, uptime of trinkets, ect.<br>
<br>
EDIT: And a way that I don't have to put in my stats every time would be cool too.</div>

Couple bugs I notice.<br>
Imp Berserker stance isnt affecting the AP proc, and possibly not at all. <br>
The combat log still has the typo where Crit is spelled Cri :P<br>
<br>
More suggestions:<br>
-unleashed rage(shaman) is another 10% AP buff<br>
-time stamp combat log<br>

(First post here so please move this / point me in the right direction if it shouldn't be here!)<br>
<br>
Getting towards 70 with my warrior, and planning on going 31/30 for some pvp before i switch to a 33/28 hopefully for some pve dps.<br>
<br>
I use the add-on Pawn, and Lootzor.com to sort and rate gear for my current warlock and rogue, and am looking to do the same thing for my warrior.  These things give each stat a value in comparison to other stats, so you can work out which is better.<br>
<br>
If we assume 1 AP = 1 value, then how would the value of the other relevant stats be, firstly for dps, and then, dare i say it, for tanking?<br>
<br>
So, for dps: (just rough numbers based on a pre-kara geared warrior)<br>
<br>
AP = 1<br>
Strength = 2?<br>
Agility = ?<br>
Crit rating = ?<br>
Hit rating = ?<br>

		<div id="post_message_464565">Regarding the question about slam usage,<br>
<br>
to be honest, I really don't know why I prioritize slam over MS or WW. However, I probably treat slam as the basic attack, and MS and WW as "rage dumps". As a 2H spec, rage will always be more of an issue than as dual wield fury, and I find that even a glancing blow gives me enough rage for a slam, whereas it often wont be enough for MS or WW. But i guess that comes down to personal preference.<br>
<br>
However, that being said, I'd welcome any positive/negative feedback on this philosophy from any other diehard imp slam pve'rs <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302210401im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":)" class="inlineimg"></div>

My philosophy is pure DPS classes (rogues/hunters) should almost always get the shared DPS loot first (cloaks, rings, trinkets, necks).  We've generally followed that rule except in cases where there is very significant upgrade value or raid playtime/contribution difference.  Most of the gear gear is distributed evenly since we run a loot council and have a very high-attendance group of raiders.  If you have more specific questions send me a PM.</div>

		<div id="post_message_464754">I still find the whole "pure DPS" argument a little hallow.  I understand the logic behind it...Rogues and Hunters only have one function on raids 99% of the time, but then so do DPS Warriors that can output close to the same amount of damage (while buffing the rest of the group).  It's not like we go after tanking gear before all of the main Warrior and Druid tanks have what they need, so what's left besides gear that suits our primary raid function?  Because we might have the ability to off tank some trash or very weak adds on specific encounters doesn't really invalidate that.<br>
<br>
I would never ever loot leather or mail over a Rogue or Hunter or even Shaman unless it was some extreme upgrade that cannot be replaced in the near future by a plate item (which has never been the case), but rings, trinkets and non Bow/Dagger weapons are an entirely different story.  On top of all that, Warriors require extremely good gear to stay competetive even against Rogues that might not have the best gear yet.</div>

The combat log still has the typo where Crit is spelled Cri :P<br>

-unleashed rage(shaman) is another 10% AP buff<br>

</div>Let's do some Theorycrafting, assuming a 5/5 Flurry Build you'd need to have a unflurried 1.25 Speed for it to work like you'd want it, even if there was a weapon with that speed it wouldn't be possible due to rage generation and be terribly ineffective due to low Slam damage.<br>
The typical Slam rotation is or, depending on your rage generation after the windfury nerf, was Auto&gt;Slam&gt;Instant&gt;Auto. For it to work perfectly you want the slowest weapon you can get due to Slam not being normalized and if possible get it down to 2.5 Speed with active Flurry, meaning unflurried 3.125 Speed with 5/5 Flurry or 2.875 with 3/5 Flurry.</div>

So basicly :<br>

Auto&gt;Slam&gt;MS&gt;Auto&gt;Slam&gt;WW(If AoE is possible else Hamstring)&gt;Auto&gt;Slam&gt;MS&gt;Auto&gt;Slam&gt;(Hamstring?)<br>

Basicly there are three instants MS,WW and Hamstring right?<br>
So if AoE isnt possible due to CC issues, you substitute WW by Hamstring and for every 4th instant you also use Hamstring ?<br>

I am currently clearing 5/6 SSC and 2/4 TK.   Ive been a BS for ages now, currently I am using the T1 BS chest and was thinking about upgrading it to t3 because I have the nethers available.  I personally dont believe it would be a great idea seeing that Vashj drops a beast chest and I could grab the rogue chest from FLK if need be.  <br>

<br>
I was wondering the same thing as i have a talon now and a dst, I just cant see dragonstrike being the best anymore. One point though is that even though it is getting nerfed, haste will always stack every time u get better gear so thats one good thing plus it will stack with dst so im sure it will be stil be good. Dont know if it will be the best though.</div>

</div>Let me just repost an abridgement of a post made for two of my guildies who were both <br>
wanting to try a 2handed Fury build for the first time. The Windfury Nerf came after said <br>
post was made, so the need to Spamstring is less urgent than it used to be.<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
Your cycle will be based around the following 3 Abilities:<br>
- Bloodthirst, Instant, 30 Rage, 6s cooldown<br>
- Whirlwind, Instant, 25 Rage, 8s cooldown<br>
- Slam, 0.5s Cast, 15 Rage, no cooldown (resets your Swing Timer)<br>
<br>
The goal of your Cycle will be to do as much damage as you can, basically you should try to achieve the following:<br>
- Keep Battleshout up<br>
- Keep Rampage up<br>
- Use Bloodthirst and Whirlwind _everytime_ they're available<br>
- Use Slam to get rid of excess Rage when BT and WW are not available<br>
(- Use Hamstring to get the chance of Flurry or Windfury Procs when BT and WW are not<br>
available and you just slammed.)<br>
<br>
The main constraint of your Cycle will be:<br>
- The Global Cooldown (1.5s)<br>
- Your Weapon Swing Timer<br>
<br>
I'll try to illustrate a 2handed Fury DPS cycle, based on the assumptions that<br>
Rampage is up, you have infinite Rage and you're permaflurried with a resulting<br>
2.5s Weaponspeed.<br>
<br>
The following diagram shows 25 seconds of a ideal 2handed fury cycle:<br>
<br>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080212094638im_/http://img260.imageshack.us/img260/981/cyclecx0.gif" border="0" alt=""><br>
<br>
The ruler at the bottom shows the timescale in a 0.5s interval.<br>
<br>
The cycle is very dense, in those 25 seconds you will score 23 damaging hits on<br>
your target.<br>
<br>
The important things in this cycle are: optimal usage of the Global Cooldown<br>
and timing slams to start right after an auto-attack landed, so they dont interfere<br>
with your Weapon Swing Timer and hence your Rage generation. Of course,<br>
due to lag you are not likely to achieve a perfect cycle, this is a mere outline<br>
of what you should be trying to achieve.</div>

	</table>
</div>So do glancing blows always take the place of just a regular hit that would have never had the possibility to crit otherwise?  Before the reduction in glancing blows and people could become "crit capped" without adding more hit, Heroic Strike ignored that, so Flurry uptime <i>was</i> affected by Heroics wasn't it?  With the potential for becoming crit capped pretty much erased, does that mean that Heroics will no longer replace white glances that might have otherwise been a crit?<br>
<br>
So instead of:<br>
<br>
auto crit<br>
auto crit<br>
auti glance<br>
<br>
you would get:<br>
<br>
auto crit<br>
auto crit<br>

i noticed you have greater blessing of salvation here instead of greater blessing of light. any tips on how i could convince my raiding pallies to give me greater salv instead of light? right now they just give the warriors greater light and i have a macro to whisper the pally buffing light to give me a 5 min salv. kind of annoying if he dies or runs low on mana (i give him crap everytime he does run low on mana because hes a freakin pally)<br>

<br>
The gloves from Gruul are very good due to the sockets- this is an annoying fact with T4-5 stuff, the lack of sockets often makes kara loot far better than late game stuff, provided you're willing to spend a couple hundred gold to max the gear out.<br>
<br>
On another note, for DPS race fights such as gruul and void reaver, I have to switch to DPS gear fairly regularly, as we go straight from HKM, where we need 4 tanks, to gruul, which needs just 3. For this reason I'd like to know any ways possible to boost my DPS while remaining prot specced- clearly it's impractical for me to respec back and forth to fury/prot to suit our raid needs, as I can't grind the gold in prot, my primary spec.</div>

<br>
Currently, I have Bloodmoon (35.29% crit in battle stance with axe spec, 1954 atp without battle shout). My guild (cleared SSC, working on KT) has a good warrior who's BF-specced so I can usually go 31-30 or 20-41.<br>
<br>
Last week though, I got my hands on a second Netherbane and I specced the typical 17-44 build for a raid. Trouble is, I did terrible. Rage was poor, crit was poor and performance was poor.<br>
<br>
For DWing, I can hit 199 hit rating (12.62% before Precision), with 29.9% crit in zerker and 2011 attack power in zerker without Battle Shout or Rampage up. <br>
<br>
I can get a Merciless off-hand right now and the faster off-hand might help with rage generation over the slower Netherbane.<br>
<br>
My quandary is it worth it right now, on the cusp of HYjal/BT, to switch to DW fury with several pieces of inferior gear or stick it out with the 2hander? And if switching to DW, what baselines stats to shoot for and any tips for maximizing raid performance?</div>

</div>With those stats, I really don't understand why you would be having issues.  The only thing questionable other than how you are actually spending rage is whether or not a slow off hand is going to have that much of an impact.  Slow or fast, they should generate "the same" rage over time, but slow will do it in larger chunks, so when you miss you really feel it, and when you hit, have a chance to actually overshoot 100 rage a lot easier.  <br>
<br>
If you haven't messed around with a DW build for a while, it might just take you a little more practice time to get the hang of it, but personally I find it much less cumbersome than a two handed spec revolving around Slam.  If you can get in 3-10 Arena games in a week, you may as well just grind out a quick off hand if you think that's the main problem.  Otherwise, just go back to using your two hander and go Fury if it's easier for you to do better damage.</div>

<br>
Your stats are perfectly balanced and very good for 17/44. More than enough hit , perfect crit and Attack Power.If you get a good group setup,you should be doing some great dps.No way you can be rage starved with that spec and a good group,except if you qued Heroic Strike every chance.<br>
<br>
Check if you do correctly your rotations and if you are used playing this spec.<br>
Of course netherbane isnt the best warrior weapon but its not bad either.A mercilles offhand or mhand will propably outperform a netherbane,but clearly you will not see dramatic changes.<br>
<br>
31/30 was a very good option pre WF nerf,now its a bit outperformed by 17/44.<br>
20/41 is better than 31/30 in my opinion and can compete with 17/44.<br>
Its clearly a matter of playstyle,I tested all and  think 17/44 is still the king on single target dps.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">i noticed you have greater blessing of salvation here instead of greater blessing of light. any tips on how i could convince my raiding pallies to give me greater salv instead of light? right now they just give the warriors greater light and i have a macro to whisper the pally buffing light to give me a 5 min salv. kind of annoying if he dies or runs low on mana (i give him crap everytime he does run low on mana because hes a freakin pally)<br>
<br>
<i>EDIT: i also noticed you have martial gauntlets off gruul with some T5. are the gruul gloves better than T4 dps? im hoving at about 200 hit rating now so i figured the extra hit couldnt hurt</i></div>

</div>Our guild runs at least 2 DPS warriors every raid. Our guild leader is meele himself, so the paladins pay attention to us more than they would, I think, if we ran a ranged-heavy setup. I know where you're coming from having to ask for 5 minute salvation, though. If you're the only DPS warrior in the raid and you don't have enough paladins to go around, I would just hotkey the macro to like 1 or something. <br>
<br>
I really like Martial Perfection gloves for the customizability. I've always liked having my stats balanced, so if I swap out my boots with Surefooted for my boots with run speed, I'll throw on the Gruul gauntlets with x2 hit rating gems to keep my hit around 220.</div>

I did my best to have the same variables in play from live to PTR - Precisely 6 minutes, NO Death Wish/Recklessness, same placement, same gear, kept 5 sunders up, kept Rampage up, kept Battle Shout up.<br>
<br>
Live - ~1240 DPS<br>
PTR - ~1130 DPS<br>
<br>
Both of my weapons and one of my trinkets are pretty much purely haste based (Dragonstrike, Swiftsteel Bludgeon, Dragonspine Trophy) so the haste nerf is hitting pretty hard, though even with that hidden cooldown I can't think of very much I'd use over Dragonspine.<br>
<br>
I'll download Procmeter and play around with it this afternoon for some further testing, but from what I glanced at on live it's really only a matter of 5-10 seconds longer between Dragonspine procs and I didn't notice any difference for Dragonstrike.<br>
<br>
<br>
Update:<br>
So I finally took the dive and started using WWS to make some reports so I could better see what's happening.<br>
<br>
Just finished a set on PTR. Gear, spec, buffs, and mob are 100% identical between PTR and Live.<br>

*There's a stray execute in the log for 5846<br>
<br>
Also, to me these numbers seem quite low, albeit only self-buffed and keeping my own sunders up. PLEASE give me any suggestions you have!<br>
<br>
What this means in relation to Dragonspine (more info to come!) - Average time between Procs on Live was ~15.5s, on PTR ~26.7s. That said this information may be flawed, as I am not sure whether the "Haste" being recorded in WWS is from Dragonstrike, Dragonspine, or both. From the average time I would assume it's recording just Dragonspine.<br>
<br>
What I'm truly curious about now is seeing a comparison between Rising Tide and Dragonstrike - So if anyone has both, could you do some testing and post WWS or anything like it?</div>

</div>It is 193 (if that number is correct im not quite up to speed) extra threat in addition to the damage the hit does.<br>
And its actually even more than 369 extra threat per hit since heroic strikes cant glance and as such on average does more than 176 extra damage than a white hit.<br>

</div>I could, I just went to this spec (before I had PH). I mostly did it to get improved overpower for threat-capped fights. For example if you look at Gurtogg in the same report, you'll see I did use overpower a decent amount, but it's just something I've started doing; I hadn't had improved overpower at all in BC as Fury.</div>

		<div id="post_message_468433">This is a post regarding wielding two identical speed weapons and the associated benefit of doing so, although part of my higher dps may be attributed to the two weapons both being slow, therefore also giving even more flurry uptime due to BT/WW keeping it up for longer durations without a 1.5 speed weapon eating them away as quickly.<br>
<br>
Anyways, I recently picked up a <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080117040452/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=28657"><span  ><span class="purplename">[Fool's Bane]</span></span></a> from Karazhan, despite already having <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080117040452/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=31965"><span  ><span class="purplename">[Merciless Gladiator's Cleaver]</span></span></a> in mainhand and <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080117040452/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=31985"><span  ><span class="purplename">[Merciless Gladiator's Hacker]</span></span></a> in my offhand, as no one else needed it.<br>
<br>
I had heard about the extra flurry charge while wielding identical speed weapons, so decided to test for myself if using the two 2.6 speed weapons would actually yield a higher dps than the 1.5 speed offhand.<br>
<br>
I tested on a typical Servant of Allistarj while keeping up Battleshout, Rampage, and repeating the BT/WW cycle with heroic strike when applicable (I did not keep up or use sunder armor for the test).<br>
<br>
While mainhanding Fool's Bane and offhanding the 2.6 speed merc glad axe I maintained a consistent 730 dps over a 10 minute period of testing.<br>
<br>
While mainhanding the 2.6 speed gladiator's axe and offhanding the 1.5 speed axe I maintained a constant 680 dps over a 10 minute period of testing.<br>
<br>
While my crit rate is low (~24% in berserker currently) it was more of a dps gain than I would have expected by using a weapon that was 10 dps lower in listed value (Fool's bane as opposed to the merc axe in MH).<br>

		<div id="post_message_468458">tristantio, part of what you are seeing is related to the fact that instant attacks like BT and WW also generate Flurry charges. By using slower weapons you're consuming those charges less often so you see a better overall flurry uptime, thus better haste overall.<br>
<br>
That being said, your crit rate is going to be significantly higher against Blasted Lands servants which exaggerates part of the test, so you'll have to see how it pans out against the MG weapons in raid situations. I would guess it will more or less be a wash.</div>

		<div id="post_message_468522">Servant of Allistarj is level 55 and therefore 75 defense lower than my 350 weapon skill, meaning that I'm getting an additional .04% chance to crit for each of those, effectively netting me 75 * .04 = 3 % extra crit rate, which is easily covered by buffs in a raid environment, so I think the testing for comparison is still fairly accurate and therefore I don't think its superfluous.<br>
<br>
I do agree that a main factor is probably the lower weapon speed and the greater significance of yellow damage therefore keeping up flurry, however 50 dps is pretty substantial especially when dropping 10 dps on the aforementioned weapons to be able to dual wield the slower ones.<br>
<br>
If Flurry is permanently up anyways (due to a much higher crit rate of around 33%+) than I'd imagine the impact is less significant, but for any lower geared fury warriors the benefit is definitely there.</div>

</div>This should be quoted and then quoted again and stickied in any forum that has any kind of discussion about Fury/Flurry.  I get so sick of seeing people talk about "how easy it is to get perma Flurry".  All the theorycrafting and spreadheets in the world won't disprove the fact that perma Flurry does not exist.  The closest thing to it is an 80%-85% uptime, but it's almost always up less than that in a real fight.</div>

		<div id="post_message_468928">If that's the case then it looks like there is a much larger benefit to dual wielding identical speed slow weapons than I had initially thought, even at higher gear levels.<br>
<br>
Slow weapons mean that instant attacks such as BT/WW/Hamstring that don't consume a flurry charge are still capable of activating flurry, and main and offhanding slow weapons will ensure that all those charges aren't eaten up by a 1.5 speed weapon.  <br>
<br>
Also the extra flurry swings from simultaneous hits with same speed weapons seems hugely beneficial also.</div>

		<div id="post_message_469220">This is my first time posting and I am a bit new to the game (been playing about 8 months now).  However, my questions often go unanswered on the class forums or my questions go over people’s heads.  No matter how new, I am a theory crafter and while some people just like clicking buttons, I love to crunch numbers.  It was suggested to me to come here and while I am apprehensive about posting among a fine group of individuals like yourself, I urge you to believe that I have given this some thought and also seen some merit in game.  Having spend lurking around a bit trying to find an answer, I came back empty on my question, albeit got a few amazing tips.<br>
<br>
My question relates to survivability of DPS warrior, so please bare with me on all defense stuff<br>
<br>
Assumption:<br>
For the sake of calculations, I will assume that 490 defense makes a warrior or a palladin 100% uncrittable.<br>
<br>
It is a far and wide fact that 490 defense will make you uncrittable (almost) against a level 73 mob (bosses).  This comes from the fact that 475 defense will compensate for 5% crit chance that a same level mob has plus extra 15 to compensate for the level difference.  (5 per level)<br>
<br>
475-350 = 125 extra defense for a mob your level<br>
125/5%  = 25 defense per % crit<br>
<br>
Extra 15 defense means that a level 73 mob has 0.6% additional chance to crit you. (interpolated)<br>
<br>
Thus a level 73 mob has a 5.6% chance to crit you with base defense (350) at level 70.<br>
<br>
Now, each point of resilience reduces a chance to be critically hit by 0.025%<br>
<br>
5.6/0.025 = 224<br>
<br>
As a DPS warrior and an avid PvP lover, my DPS gear mostly comes from PvP rewards and the Arena.  Hence, my DPS gear is heavily resilience based.  I know that resilience does not come free and that I am giving up some stats and perhaps gem slots for it, but in the guild I am in and the way tier tokens are set, I am competing against tanks and healers for tier pieces and thus, understandably, am at the bottom of the loot distribution list.  Always striving towards improving my character, I sought gear upgrades elsewhere.<br>
<br>
So, the $64,000 question.<br>
Is my calculation above skewed or does it really mean that if I have ~225 resilience on my DPS gear that I would be virtually uncrittable in PvE?<br>
<br>
Inquiring minds would love your input.</div>

		<div id="post_message_469237">While you could be crit immune, that certainly doesn't mean a trash mob won't turn around and 2 shot you anyway.  As a dps warrior, I find that I have, in general, the worst survivability of any class.  My avoidance is inferior to a rogue, you take 10% more damage which all but negates your armor, and you have inferior aggro management.  As such, I don't value any sort of defensive stat other than stamina.  And, given that I'm clearing 11k hp raid buffed to survive any AOE secondary target damage, even additional stamina is of little value.  You can't hit point something to death.<br>
<br>
S2 gladiator gear is an excellent fill in for T4 level DPS gear.  It has decent strenght, crit, and some hit.  It's also about 20 ilvls higher than t4.  T5 gear, which is what S2 gear is equivalent to, is superior to it for PVE dps.  The long and short of it is you can do ok with that gear because it is higher level even than what you are using it to replace but in the long run, the PVE gear out distances it.<br>
<br>
Also, your resilience is of almost no value.  15% crushing blows will kill you 3x more often than 5% crits.  Intervene the tank on a boss one time and see how hard they hit.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I had heard about the extra flurry charge while wielding identical speed weapons, so decided to test for myself if using the two 2.6 speed weapons would actually yield a higher dps than the 1.5 speed offhand.<br>

So, in your test it's fairly likely that your weapons got out of sync (unless someone else was tanking the mob) and any potential benefit of having matched weapons was lost.  It's quite possible that due to the funny stuff going on with Flurry that there actually is no benefit to matched weapons -- that will take more testing as far as I know.

167 hit is alittle to low. You should aim to have 200 as a minimum. Dragonstrike is better in my opinion as the incoming haste nerf will see static haste gear as sub par compared to their equal level counterparts with stats. Dragonstike is proc based and hasnt got internal cooldowns so I think it will be your best bet dps wise.</div>

A lot of mobs/bosses do at least some form of raidwide damage that can't be avoided, and the way resilience has been coded, what this means is that this damage can proc things like Enrage (and to a lesser extent Blood Craze).<br>

Against a fight like Gorefiend, as a 33/28 bloodfrenzy spec, i was getting a significant number of Enrage procs from the Shadowbolts flying around.<br>

</div>While the tests did not prove anything, they give an indication. <br>
An inferior OH weapon (by itself) gave (considerably) more total DPS.<br>
Whether this is due to the lower speed (and thus higher flurry uptime - data on this could have helped here) or to synchronized speed ...I don't know.<br>
I <b>think </b>we see both effects at work here.<br>
<br>
EDIT: Ahh, on second thought, I finally got your reasoning. That him fighting the mobs (unless someone else tanked) would inevitably result in some parries and as such negating the synchronized weapon speeds. From this you conclude that most (if not all) of his result was due to other criteria (lower speed presumably) and not the matched speed. Hmm, yes that sounds reasonable.<br>
<br>
And as to your objection that parrying would negate the syncronized speed: most fury warriors do not tank, and as such do not parry - so this should be not an argument per se against synchronized weapon speed (in a PvE Raid environement).</div>

</div>Currect, but slam is not an "on next attack" ability.  Perhaps my wording was poor.  All auto-attack swings (and abilities that augment auto-attack swings) consume flurry charges.  Instants and additional attacks (HoJ procs, sword spec procs, WF, slam, BT, MS, WW, Hamstring) do not.<br>
<br>
Now, my own question:  given the recoding of WF, can the second hit of a cleave proc WF?  HS can proc WF and the first hit of cleave should but what about the second?  It still falls into the "on next attack" category, but is also of the "aoe" physical school similar to WW. When I'm DPSing 2 trash mobs, there are generally too many numbers on the screen to really know what is going on.</div>

</div>You bring up a very good point with Enrage.  <br>

I am, however, having trouble understanding how would a stat like resilience, which hinders the frequency and damage dealt to you via a crit, lead to a proc of a talent like enrage which is crit driven.  Do you mind shedding some light on this "coding" you are speaking of?</div>

		<div id="post_message_470095">Resilience reduces the chance to be crit.  However, the way things seem to have been done, the game has no way of knowing if a regular hit you take was "supposed" to have been a crit (but wasn't due to Resilience).  So they do a second roll, for all non-critical hits taken, against your Resilience in order to fudge the "oh, this was supposed to have been a crit" calculation and decide whether to effects like Enrage.<br>
<br>
Subsequently, stuff that cannot crit can proc Enrage through Resilience, like standing in fires.  Or at least it used to be able to.  I still get Enraged occasionally in a raid by NPC stuff, and I think that includes spells which can't crit.<br>
<br>
This is also the reason a "crit that wasn't" doesn't proc Enrage AND Blood Craze - when you're crit, both proc, but ordinary hits, the roll against Resilience is two separate rolls (one for each effect).  The chance of both coming true at the same time is pretty small.  There's a blue post about it someplace on that cardplace website.</div>

		<div id="post_message_471280">The intention of the mechanic is to not devalue talents which are based on crit events (like enrage) with resilience making a PVP warrior who values enrage highly have to choose between his effective talents and his resilience PVP gear.  The idea is to maintain crit based events like enrage at their pre-resilience proc rates while decreasing the crit rates through the resilience mechanics.  If resilience roll currently has not check for "can crit/crit chance", there will likely be a modification/correction to it.  Can a warlock proc enrage in a warrior wearing resilience through dots?  That would be an enrage proc that would not normally happen as dots cannot crit.  Thus, in the PVP environment, enrage actually gains in usefulness with resilience giving you and unintended proc rate.  Now, if you had 50% crit chance reduction through resilience giving you a 50% chance to gain blood craze/enrage but only facing opponents who only natively have ~20-30% crit chance, your resilience has increased your proc rate above what would normally even be possible.  This is important because in PVE, mobs/spells usually only have a 5-6% crit rate.  It is very easy to surpass that with resilience.</div>

</div>While I agree with your conclusion, I think you missed the entire point of what was posted above by Charsi and others.  When a spell hits you, resilience mechanics say that a roll is made to determine if the non-crit spell <i>would have been </i>a crit, and enrage may be triggered accordingly.  Because of one quirk or another, this roll doesn't take into account that some spells cannot crit.</div>

</div>I find it vaguely useful, personally.  I wear it for trash clearing sometimes.  Occasionally, dumb stuff happens, tanks die, mobs get loose, I pull aggro (usually the latter more than anything) and I find myself "tanking".  In resilience gear I can pull on a shield and, while I take a ton of damage, I do feel a little bit tougher than if I was caught in pure dps plate.<br>
<br>
It's like a nice middleground set that you can dps in without losing too much and, if something goes wrong, pick up and survive trash adds in a pinch.  It's certainly nothing i'd wear full time or to tank anything serious, but I take on trash with Gladiator's gear rather than itemrack in my full tanking suit.<br>
<br>
After all it is my highest HP gear I have laying around that renders me uncrittable without gimping my damage or my threat.<br>
<br>
I'm pretty sure I have occasionally procced enrage off NPC spells, they've fixed most of the really obvious stuff (like standing near braziers in IF, or fall damage), so it's mostly physical damage and maybe one or two spells they might have overlooked.  I'm almost certain i've never procced it off a dot.</div>

<br>
Against a fight like Gorefiend, as a 33/28 bloodfrenzy spec, i was getting a significant number of Enrage procs from the Shadowbolts flying around.<br>

</div>with an enhance shaman you're going to be hitting really high AP.  At that point crit will give more DPS than AP because of the way they scale with each other.  I'd go with 5str and 5crit or even straight up crit.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Looking at your armory (2900 AP 34% crit 204 hit) buffed I would go with either.  With SoE totem and unleashed rage you will hit 3500 AP.  Strength will probably benefit you more when you are soloing, but fully raid buffed the comparison is close.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
I've got a tough choice with one piece of gear though - Bloodlust Brooch vs Hourglass of the Unraveller. <br>
<br>
Stats with BB - 1968 AP, 30.3 Crit<br>
Stats with HU - 1896 AP, 31.75 Crit<br>

I'm leaning towards using Hourglass simply for a higher chance to keep flurry up, as with less Windfury procs the faster I can swing the better (and more sword spec procs!).<br>

- First, what is this 'crit cap'? If I'm not mistaken, this is based on hit rating. If a formula is available, that would be most helpful.<br>

		<div id="post_message_472376"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I'm bored and figured I'd answer your questions.<br>
<br>
Crit Cap:<br>
<br>
The average level 73 boss will have a hit table, I believe, which looks like this (assuming you have 20% crit and no hit, and you are attacking from behind):<br>
<br>
0-28:Miss<br>
28-33.6: Dodge<br>
33.6-58.6: Glancing<br>
58.6-78.6: Crit<br>
78.6-100: Hit<br>
<br>
I assume you know the basics of the hit table, like how adding 1% crit removes 1% hit from the table.  The crit cap occurs when there is no more hit to remove.  In this situation, the crit cap would occur at 41.4% crit, assuming you have not hit.  Each 1% hit you add would increase the hit cap by 1%, also.<br>
<br>
The chance for 3 attacks to not crit in a row is simple to calculate.  It's just their chance to not hit, cubed.  This way, you can set up a simple equation to calculate this.  In your case, you wanted to know when there was a 10% chance for 3 attacks in a row to not crit.  That equation would like .10=x^3.  When you solve it, you find that it should take 53.6% crit for there to be a 10% chance to not crit 3 attacks in a row.<br>
<br>
You than compare this to the hit table discussed earlier.  Since there is a cap at 41.4% crit, and each 1% hit added increases this cap by 1%, you would need 12.2% hit to go along with that 53.6% crit.<br>
<br>
Hope that helps (and that I didn't make any stupid mistakes &gt;.&lt;).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

You've focused far too much on +hit and your other stats are badly lacking (Especially crit)<br>
<br>
Some of your gems are vendor bought and you could look at some different items/enchants to raise your crit/AP without dropping too low on +hit (Around 200 is perfectly fine)<br>
<br>
Your spec needs some work aswell, Im unsure why you would pick 3/3 TM in the protection tree and not have a pvp spec or have improved overpower. <br>
<br>
Anyway you sit in berserker stance permantly while dps'ing as a warrior (Unless you need to help with thunderclap..)<br>
<br>
You could change some talent points around here and there (Improved execute is awesome)<br>
<br>

		<div id="post_message_472647"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I ran a couple tests with that simulator that was posted earlier. I ran some overnight with the same setup but different weapon speed combinations(same weapon dps). I also ran a few with different levels of hit but the same weapon speeds. <br>
<br>
Assuming the sim is accurate, there were a couple trends:<br>
<br>
1. Slow MH are best. <br>
<br>
Most people already knew this. I suspect this is the case until you have so much rage that your HS is limited by MH swing speed rather than rage. Since the test also had Mongoose on the MH, as most do, that probably helped even more.<br>
<br>
<br>
2. Combined with a Slow MH the speed of the OH has very little effect on DPS, &lt;1%. <br>
<br>
With all the posts, WoW forums and here, claiming slow or fast is better, it doesn't seem to matter. <br>
<br>
Now these results all depend on the simulator being accurate of course, but watching the combat log it seems to work pretty well. I also can't find any theorycraft that has a valid reason to doubt the results. If anyone has anything either way please post it., I may do some more specific testing later.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I was wondering at what point to prioritize STR/AP over +HIT. I've heard many arguments that say that at 8.6% you can stop stacking +HIT over Crit and STR/AP but then I see alot of posts suggesting that ~200 +HIT is when to stop stacking it.<br>

I understand that +HIT will increase my off-hand auto attack damage after 8.6% is reached but is the Rage generation going to boost my dps more than the added AP from STR/AP?<br>

		<div id="post_message_472674"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I think your conclusions are correct. I ran a few tests with my own simulator right now.<br>
<br>
My Results are:<br>
<br>
The difference between a season 2 sword and dagger are &gt; 50 dps for my gear and buffs. Surprisingly the gain from windfury stays the same, but whirl wind dps goes down by roughly a third. Also overall dps is reduced by the lower Mongoose uptime, because specials suffer from the decreased proc chance.<br>
<br>
The difference between a 1.5 speed offhand and a 2.6 speed offhand are neglectible. The faster the offhand the more often +Weapondamage is applied but a faster offhand also seems to decrease windfury procs by a tininess. I cant see why at the moment, perhaps due to flurry mechanics. It probably doesnt matter, since the difference between the two are 0,1% for my gear and buffs. I think this can be seen as insignificant.<br>
<br>
And if you have zero +Weapondamage the difference is 0.4% as I calculated right now, so even then offhand speed doesnt matter.<br>
<br>
I still prefer a faster offhand due to the more consistent rage gain.<br>

<br>
1/(MHSpd/1.25)  - Flurried MH swings per second<br>
<u>1/(OHSpd/1.25)  - Flurried OH swings per second</u><br>
Total Swings per Second (TS)<br>
<br>
3/TS = Time period for 3 flurried swings (tp)<br>
<br>
tp/6 = Blood thirsts per Flurry Cycle<br>
tp/9 = WW per cycle<br>
.2*(tp*Flurried MH swings per second) = WFs per cycle<br>
<u>X  = other specials that can crit per flurry cycle (spamstring)</u><br>
Total Bonus Swings per Flurry Cycle (BS)<br>
<br>
Flurry Uptime = 1-(1-Crit%)^(3+BS)<br>
<br>
So if you get in 1 special per flurry cycle (which you probably don't), you would have flurry chance of 1-(1-crit%)^(3+1).   I think the spreadsheets use this math as well.  The point is your flurry up time can be maximized/optimized through slower weapons for more bonus swings as well as higher crit chance.  As your crit chance increases, the increase in Flurry uptime will taper off as it approaches 100%.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I also vaguely calculated some DPS values (neglecting flurry) for Str vs. Crit on itemization points.  I breifly modeled unflurried autoattack, BT, and WW for .15 (miss + dodge), values of ap 2000-4500, crit from .3-.41, glancing blows, 0 mitigation on target, basic Imp/Fury spec.  For all values of ap, starting with a 30% crit chance, 10 AP returned 2.544 DPS (.56 dps per itemization points w/ kings).  At 40% crit chance, 10 ap was .616 dps per itemization point.  Given the high flurry up times of .3 and .40 crit, added crit returns limited flurry uptime increase.  Modeling flurry in would then increase DPS based around higher return on AP rather than Crit.  At 2000 ap, 1% crit yielded 6.54 dps (.3 dps per itemization point).  At 4500 ap, the return rises to .55 dps per itemization point.  So, according to what gear I have (I theoretically peak my AP in the low 4k range during a raid and almost always above 3500, str is always preferrable to crit point for point.  At my peak values, the crit is competitively valued before I account for flurry.  My conclusion for gearing is to keep up a decent crit and stack AP.  Hit I will take as I get gear with it.  With some decent raid gear (I could use T5 pants, eradication bracers), I'll hit 200 hit rating without effort which is adequate.  I don't clearly see a point above 30% crit but below 4500 ap peak where stacking crit is superior.  AP tends to have a linear return increasing dps by a fairly flat amount.  Crit has a scaling return increasing DPS by a fraction of your DPS.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Serida's DPS confuses me sometimes, but then I take everything else into account when comparing it to my own.<br>
<br>
Blood Legion truly does stack their DPS groups, and their DPSers have insane gear.<br>
<br>
I did Gorefiend last week as 33/28 (without Imp Slam) and only pulled 1200 DPS, but at the same time the top DPSer was only doing 1750. So put in perspective (percentage wise) it's very similar.<br>
<br>
As for him beating a fury warrior in raw DPS I can only assume the fury warrior a) didn't have WF, b) wasn't using DST, c) wasn't in a DPS group at all, or d) all of the above.<br>
<br>
I quite simply don't see how it's possible any other way, as I have reasonably comparable gear to Serida and I pulled a good 300 DPS lower than our fury warrior.<br>
<br>
I respecced back to Imp Slam so I'll post up a WWS of my damage on the next kill - I expect to see 1300-1350 DPS if not more assuming I don't get ghosted,<br>
<br>
<b>Edit</b> - Ararat is a Prot Warrior normally (judging from his 5/5 T6 tank + bulwark of azzinoth) so I'm going to assume his fury gear is piss poor compared to normal Hyjal/BT level warriors :P<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I'd think he'd have a few more considering the attack speed difference between 1H and 2H, or maybe he was just plain unlucky with WF.<br>

</div>This doesn't make sense.  If you are able to achieve the threat cap using any build, your focus should be to get the most damager per point of aggro. To do that, the first thing you should do is remove HS from the table.  It a worse damage/aggro ratio than auto-attack.  Other moves like hamstring which do little damage per aggro should also be avoided.  What you wind up with is pure white damage + base specials.  Using only those, a fury warrior and 33/28 have the same rate of damage per aggro.  If they can do 2 damage per 1 point of aggro, for sake of argument, then 200k aggro to work with (ignoring 10% bonuses or assuming it's already counted) will net them both 400k damage.  The question becomes can a fury warrior keep up with an arms warrior without using HS.  Post WF nerf, I don't think that is an issue at all.  I have neglected aggro from BT healing as it is trivial over the coarse of a fight.  <br>
<br>
On a aggro capped fight a 33/28 warrior is superior because he is able to use up the available aggro while adding damage to the remaining melee.  His personal dps is not the deciding factor.  I don't think HS usage belongs in any discussion of aggro cap fights as using HS in any capacity hurts your damage/aggro ratio.  Given a Vashj trinket and dual fast weapons (think swiftsteel bludgeon), it could be argued that a fury warrior is superior to an arms warrior for an aggro capped fight due to the larger number of individual crits greatly enhancing the usefulness of that trinket.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

If you have the minimum +hit for raiding, 9%, you still miss 19%, so thats 19% longer tp which then makes instants more influential on flurry. I think thats significant and might change the relative values of +hit overall.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Slam isn't normalized which means the damage it does scales way, way up with a slower weapon, especially at ~3000+ buffed AP. A 3.8 weapon like Torch will put out very efficient slams, but with a sword the cost of delaying white hits to fit slams in is trickier, especially since it costs 2 talent points to make slam viable in the first place<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_475054"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I have been reading back the past several pages and i have not noticed that the question "After 2.2 will a Wicked edge of the Plains out DPS a Dragonstrike" followed by "What enchant would be best for which" . From the way i see it i think Mongoose would be better on the Wicked edge, whilst potency on the Dragonstrike. <br>
But im not sure myself the calculations as to wether or not Dragonstrike still leads to greater DPS then the Wicked Edge of the Plains. <br>

I think the main problem with people not using slam anymore is that they try to stick with the old cycle auto-slam-style which seems not to be fitting anymore. Simply slam every second or third hit if it doesn't fit in the normal cycle or if you have problems getting the timing correctly. But getting slams off in the correct timing ( around 0.7 secs after the melee hit ) still grants more dps than the 0.7 seconds autohit + harmstring.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Excellent mathematical analysis;  could you comment on the value of crit over AP/str when taking into account threat caps and the Vashj trinket: Prism of Inner Calm.  <br>
<br>
Is it possible that this trinket tips the balance toward crit earlier in the AP spectrum?<br>
<br>
Thanks for helping out a math failure.<br>

</div>I hardly ever do.  My hit is not very high, only 200 or so, so my rage generation is about on par with the damage I can do without overaggroing.  Also, my gear is only from SSC 5/6 and TK 1/4 and hence far from awesome and my tank generates very good aggro; I don't have problems with spamming HS to get rid of large chunks of rage.  I lack a couple good rings, and I'm still using two blue trinkets.  Yeah, I need to get the brooch at least, I know. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080518172410im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/frown.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":(" class="inlineimg"><!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

At about 600-800 TPS, the tank will hold over me until I am well over 1k DPS.<br>

Vashj adds:  The blueberries don't attack and you can't full dps the striders.  I guess you are talking about the nagas.  I don't hit the nagas for the first 10 seconds they are up.  I run around the top killing spare blue berries and proccing VR.  If a strider is at 50% or less, I'll hit that some.  I probably wouldn't use the threat trinket on this fight.<br>
<br>
On Hydross, I dps down an add on each phase shift before I get back on him.  A poorly timed attack will pull hydross on you at 500 or 350 threat.  <br>
<br>
I can see about guessing some numbers at prism but it's really 2 different dimensions.  It will always improve your damage/aggro point and it will always cost you DPS.  Whether it's useful or not really pertains to A:  are you pushing the aggro cap and B:  would lessening your HS spam get you under the cap before trading in for a lower dps trinket.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I just never go full out, normally just autoattacking to start then ww/cleaving. Add aggro is generally more sketchy than Hydross so i tend to leave them alone as well. Being raid leader i just tend to focus on calling out DoT stopping/Transitions but it would be nice to not worry about pulling and just going balls to the wall.<br>
<br>
The more i look at this trinket, the more it seems like a hybrid/offspec trinket. A decent rogue should never need it, Mages neither properly specced. So it just falls to Moonkins, DPS Warriors and non-resto shaman.<br>

</div>I dont have the math behind my statement, but I've tried all kinds of setups, 300 hit rating 250 hit rating 200 hit rating with ~100 ap differences between each, 200 hit and more ap gave me much better dps than 250 hit with 100 less ap or 300 hit with 200 less ap.<br>
<br>
You dont 'NEED' windfury all the time, just that its VERY beneficial. Our last morogrim kill I did 1200 dps without windfury, so you can most definately pull &gt;1000dps without it, just that if you do have it, youll likely be doing over 200 more dps.</div>

		<div id="post_message_476833">@ the 200 thing. 200 hit is easy to get without focusing on, or gemming for it and it allows you to focus on AP/crit/stamina more.<br>
<br>
It seems to be the break even point in itemization. 100 is bad, 200 is good, but 300 would be excellent. 300 though, would force you to give up a ton of other stats to get hit that high. You'd lose more then you'd gain in other words.<br>
<br>
It's the same going the other way. It's hard to get your hit much lower then 200 once you are well geared in full T4/T5 gear.<br>
<br>
As for windfury, we are a class balanced around assuming we will have it. We benefit double from it compared to other classes in that we get damage from the WF proc, and that damage gives us more rage to do MORE damage. No one's saying you can't do good damage without a WF totem, but you can't be <b>competitive </b>without it, and since i know someone will disagree with me on that point....this is assuming equal gear and skill. Beating up green-geared rogues is no accomplishment in full T6 caliber DPS gear, same with destroying a hunter that doesn't use his pet/steady shot rotation. <br>
<br>
The point I'm making here is; If a DPS warrior doesn't have a WF totem, then you'd probably be better off taking another class for that spot, as they (being much less reliant on raid buffs) wouldn't suffer as much from the loss. <br>
<br>
People say they get 1000 dps without a WF totem....and while 1000 DPS is good, they are probably tenth or less on the DPS meter, as the gear it takes to do that manner of dps WITHOUT the totem would mean everyone else is pumping out some MEAN dps too.<br>
<br>
Example; that vash'j fight i was like 12-15th on in phase 1 i was pulling 900+ dps...which isn't terrible...but there were 12-15 people doing MORE then that. The attempts i have a WF totem I'm from 4-6 on the DPS meter, doing 1150-1200 dps.</div>

</div>Archimonde is not a good fight for DPS comparisons.  Fires &amp; Air bursts are dice rolls that will affect how much DPS time melee will have.  I've gone from 1022 to 1316 DPS in sequential weeks with minor gear upgrades.  <br>
<br>
If you want to compare DPS on a single target you need to compare apples to apples.  Teron Gorefiend is best, and to a lesser extend Tidewalker, Solarian, and Anetheron.  Tidewalker may be threat limited, Solarian can be masked by AE damage, and you can be slept on Anetheron.</div>

Well take this parse: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302190708/http://www.lossendil.com/wws/?report=kbhvucdxc5tks&amp;s=4693-5114" target="_blank">Wow Web Stats</a> <br>
<br>
~57% of the damage done to gurtogg was physical, not counting my own. 57% of 5,600,000 is 3,192,000. The Blood Frenzy debuff on gurtogg constituted ~3.85% of that, adding ~122k to my damage which would raise my contribution above CR's, and that's not even counting the ~450ap I give to my group via battle shout. Also, those rogues both have DST's, which is really really huge right now and won't be quite so much after the patch. DPS warriors aren't so amazing that every guild without one needs to rush out and recruit one, but we certainly pull our weight and we bring some really important buffs/debuffs to the table. We also tank trash just fine while still fitting into boss fights better than prot paladins do for healing or feral druids do for DPS</div>

Seriously, without Windfury, it's not even worth trying really. I had to do vashj this week without windfury (still working on her...had an elemental and resto shaman show. Elemental shaman to mage group, and resto to MT group for grounding) I couldn't break top 12 DPS in phase 1 either. On phase 2 i tore it up on the elementals...but that's because VR is pure hacks on em.</div>

 My enhance shaman hardly ever gives me WF. So I still think its very possible for DPS warriors to be competitive DPS without WF. Sure it helps but its not neccesary. True Karathress is in my opinion a very friendly melee fight. But it shows what DPS warriors can do without WF. <br>

</div>Well as a Warrior u normally dont get hit by the fire and can intercept when u get bursted. If you dont have 10 melees or sth and make 2 melee camps burst shouldnt hit you more than once every 30seconds, so generally you can stay all the time at archimonde.<br>

		<div id="post_message_477150">Greetings, I know this is a Future of warrior dps thread, but, since i am a warrior, and its for my future dps, and there are some amazing posters in here, i was wondering if i could get alittle advice<br>
<br>
At present, im using the stage 2 mace. i have the vortex for stage 3, but im undecided. After the haste change, i am unsure if the Dragons trike will be better then the Wicked edge of the plains. I also have the option of the Talon of the Phoenix and talon of Azshara. my present stats are -- Unbuffed: 29.60% Crit, 1890AP, 200hit. My hit will go to around 230 oce i get the Red Belt of battle and Fel-Steel Warhelm. and Ap to around 2k. So im unsure which of these would be the best option for me. (Im not very good with game mechanics maths so unsure the exact dps change of the reduced haste effect)<br>
<br>
Also, i have heard rumours that mongoose wont be normalised, if this holds true is this a better mainhand enchant then potency? <br>

</div>How about for the simple fact that you can buff AP up to ~464 with any of the raid DPS specs?  We are still working on Kael, so I cannot make any accurate comments about fully BT geared Rogues and Warriors, but right now I do more damage than either of our Rogues for total raid DPS (not my rank on SWstats), because I generally do around 1-2% less personal DPS except on fights like Karathress and Kazzak (not that Kazzak really matters anymore).<br>
<br>

Also, how often is Feint actually even used anymore in a raid setting?  Vanish sure, is obviously superior to death + Soul Stone/Rebirth, and they also do not have high threat attacks like Heroic Strike or Hamstring, and while yes threat sucks as a Warrior, it's manageable enough when you have good tanks.<br>

</div>I'm trying to use the latest dps spreadsheet to compare Dragonstrike to Wicked Edge. I'm getting slightly more (&lt;0.5%) dps from using the Wicked edge over Dragonstrike after the haste nerf. My guess is that this is easily within the error margins for the spreadsheet. In terms of theorycrafting it seems like the mace and axe are pretty even after the haste nerf. If you're an Orc you should probably go for the axe, while humans should go for the mace (the +5 weapon skill is godly for these races).<br>
<br>
This version of the spreadsheet (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302190708/http://elitistjerks.com/465290-post1637.html" target="_blank">http://elitistjerks.com/465290-post1637.html</a>) does not have a working buff and talent section yet, but should have a correct treatment of WF after nerf. There might be errors in it so don't flame me if you get different results <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302190708im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/wink.gif" border="0" alt="" title=";)" class="inlineimg"><br>
<br>
edit: there's actually a new version of the spreadsheet up now, so go to the last page of that thread instead and use the latest version.</div>

</div>Whatever works for your raid.  I just know that for us, the spitfire gets off more than one volley if the melee are not helping. And as a Warrior, there really is not a whole lot of running/DPS loss when you can simply Cleave and WW it. It hurts Rogues a lot more than Warriors.  It's better for ranged to be doing it when all that's left is Karathress simply because melee get frozen so much, but when we are killing the Shaman, we have everyone focusing on it. Kill order might also have something to do with it.  When we had our very first kill, we were killing the Hunter first, but then we changed it to the Shaman.</div>

<br>
A couple of things I always say are that, <br>
<br>
1. MS DPS is far to reliant on windufry totems.  One night we may not have one, and then we havea 400-500 dps ball and chain bringing down the raid.  Plus WF seems only to add about 150 or so dps.<br>
<br>
2. Blood frenzy adds about (I have not done the exact math, so this is just a guess)  30-40 DPS to each physical damage dealer.  I personally would rather have one DW fury warrior in the raid doing 1100 PDS, then that.<br>
<br>
Now, the reason im posting here is because I WANT to be proved wrong or right.  Please help me out here so I know what is better for my raid groups.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

The first equation should be ( ( damage.physical * 1.04 ) - damage.physical ), which can be simplified to ( damage.physical * 0.04 ).<br>
<br>
The second equation should be ( damage.physical - ( damage.physical / 1.04 ) ).<br>

		<div id="post_message_482007"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Time for me to re-hijack my thread back... and pose a new question:<br>
<br>
What's your view on hit rating beyond 95?<br>
<br>
I've seen people say that it shouldn't be ignored, but not stacked, I've seen people say it should be stacked like any other stat, and I've seen people say it should be ignored after 95.<br>
<br>
The majority of the dps warriors that I respect as knowledgeable about the class suggest that after 95 hit rating, more +hit is a relatively weak stat when compared to +crit and +str. I want to know how valid people think this argument is. I personally believe that it shouldn't be ignored, and that it shouldn't be "stacked" per se, but focused on more than most suggest.<br>
<br>
The major argument against stacking it is that +hit is for generating rage, and generating rage alone. Therefore after 95 hit rating (the point at which all special abilities will hit) all the extra hit rating is doing is generating more rage for you to use. This is negligible therefore since a fury warrior running with windfury and other raid buffs is rarely if ever starved for rage. What I don't agree with here is that +hit is only a means to gain rage. Every attack that lands instead of misses, is a source of damage as well as rage, not just rage. Granted the white attack could be a glancing blow and therefore have reduced damage and be incapable of a crit, it's still added damage.<br>
<br>
If we're to compare hit with the other two important stats, crit and strength, then it's a little harder to see which comes out on top in terms of priority. Especially with the addition of gems to the game.<br>
<br>
Looking at it from a whole % value where the warrior's stats are balanced, 16 hit rating is roughly equivalent to 1% more dps. As is 22 crit rating, and a variable amount of attack power/strength (depending how much attack power/strength the warrior has). Just looking at it this way, it's evident that strength/attack power becomes a weaker and weaker stat when the warrior has more of it. In order to gain 1% of the warrior's dps at 100 dps, only 7 strength is needed (14 attack power = 1 dps). This is much cheaper than getting 22 crit rating or 16 hit rating. However, at a point where the warrior has 1000 dps, 10 dps is needed to increase the total dps by 1%. Now we need 140 attack power to gain the same overall percentage increase as we did previously, so this alternative is no longer cheaper than 22 crit rating or 16 hit rating. The reason 22 crit rating and 16 hit rating are valued higher than an equivalent dps increase from attack power in my view, is that they are a static % increase in dps regardless of how much of each stat the warrior currently has. <br>
<br>
Now obviously there are caps to how much +hit or +crit you can have and still be useful. In general however, at a point where the warrior is running with 2000 attack power, an increase in dps through crit/hit is much cheaper and easier to get than an equivalent increase in attack power. Another point I should mention before I'm flamed against it, is that there is also a balance that needs to be maintained in the "holy trinity" of warrior stats. The more strength you have, the less valuable it is compared to crit/hit, the more crit you have, the less valuable in comparison to the other two stats it is... and so forth. <br>
<br>
Unfortunately, most other warriors I have seen discussing this point leave out +hit in the "holy trinity" so it becomes a holy duality. They claim that the extra rage gained from having that +hit is threat inefficient because it forces the warrior to use heroic strike/cleave more to dump rage. What I want to know is that, given the surplus of rage, why warriors think they need to dump all that rage inefficiently, why can't we accept the added white damage from +hit as simply more dps, and not use the surplus rage inefficiently.<br>
<br>
Given these arguments, I want to take another look at the relative cost of a % increase in dps from the three different sources. Assuming the warrior is doing 1000 dps (respectable, but not insane), we would need 22 crit rating (1% crit), 16 hit rating (1% hit) or 70 strength (10 dps) in order to have the same impact on our overall dps. Granted that these numbers are rough, and that there are other intricacies that affect the usefulness of each stat, such as Impale and Flurry inflating the value of crit and Bloodthirst inflating the value of strength. However, the modification they make to this argument is small enough to be overlooked for the time being. When we look at these values, 70 strength is almost 9 full gems of +8 strength. 22 crit rating is almost 3 gems of +8 crit rating, while 16 hit rating is onl 2 gems of +8 hit rating. Judging the stats from this point of view, +hit is the cheapest way to get more dps (within a reasonable balance of stats). Then +crit, then +strength. <br>
<br>
To make comparisons fairer, let's assume the warrior has the minimum stats that have been generally realized by the warrior community as "needed" to do effective dps. 33% crit to ensure an optimum Flurry uptime, and 9% hit to ensure that no special attacks miss. Given these values, added crit and added hit have no "major" impact on the warrior's dps, that is to say that added amounts of each stat have no value beyond an increase in general damge done. Beyond 33% crit, crit is useful because it doubles the damage of our white attacks, and multiplies the damage of our special attacks by a factor of 2.1 (from Impale). The added amount of damage from Impale, as well as the fact that added crit will affect both white and yellow damage, crit is a very valuable stat. Adding hit instead, our special attacks already are guaranteed to land, we have not reached the crit cap and therefore they do not subsequently increase our "useful" crit chance, all they do is increase the chances of our white attacks landing. This is a flat 1% increase in white damage. Now compare this all to strength, an added amount of 70 strength is needed to compare to 1% values of the other two stats, we can deflate this value a little by saying that more strength = more attack power = harder Bloodthirst hits, which form a substantial amount of our dps. Even so, we can safely say that this would not inflate the value of strength so much as to make 16 strength an equivalent dps increase as 16 hit rating or 16 crit rating (here I'm inflating the value of crit due to it's effect via Impale).<br>
<br>
Judging by these comparisons, I would say that after 95 hit rating, (roughly) 33% crit and 1000 steady dps have been achieved, the priority of increasing stats should be +crit then +hit, then +str.<br>
<br>
I'll stress this one last time however: <b><i>I firmly believe that no stat listed should be taken into extremes that would put it out of balance with the other two.</i></b><br>
<br>
Tell me what you think of this prioritization, discounting the new stat from BT (Haste).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
A large portion of the "don't focus on hit" comes from the fact that once you hit T5 level gear, being above the 95 +hit rating is a given.  If I had 0 +hit gems, I would be at 165 hit rating without having full T5 gear.  You will passively achieve 200 hit rating without gearing for it.  More stats is always more stats so you move from Bladespire warbands to Bracers of Eradication.  That's a 17 hit upgrade.  I don't think anyone is arguing that you should take an item with 5 more strength at the expense of 20 hit, merely that, 1 for 1, both strength and crit which increase all damage dealt are superior to hit which increases only white damage after 95.  When you stack massive haste buffs, hit becomes more valuable.  If you had a fight where white damage far and away overpowers your yellow damage, you would stack hit.  In general, though, as your rage generation increases, your white damage component decreases due to the addition of HSs which, again, do not benefit from additional +hit.  Additional hit levels out your rage generation and is generally helpful.  It is not worth gemming for or specifically gearing towards.<br>
<br>
"Granted the white attack could be a glancing blow and therefore have reduced damage and be incapable of a crit, it's still added damage."<br>
<br>
The way this is worded sounds like you're not using a single roll attack table.  Glances and crits are generally mutually exclusive.  <br>
<br>
"Looking at it from a whole % value where the warrior's stats are balanced, 16 hit rating is roughly equivalent to 1% more dps. As is 22 crit rating, and a variable amount of attack power/strength (depending how much attack power/strength the warrior has). Just looking at it this way, it's evident that strength/attack power becomes a weaker and weaker stat when the warrior has more of it. In order to gain 1% of the warrior's dps at 100 dps, only 7 strength is needed (14 attack power = 1 dps). This is much cheaper than getting 22 crit rating or 16 hit rating. However, at a point where the warrior has 1000 dps, 10 dps is needed to increase the total dps by 1%. Now we need 140 attack power to gain the same overall percentage increase as we did previously, so this alternative is no longer cheaper than 22 crit rating or 16 hit rating. The reason 22 crit rating and 16 hit rating are valued higher than an equivalent dps increase from attack power in my view, is that they are a static % increase in dps regardless of how much of each stat the warrior currently has. "<br>
<br>
This paragraph is flat wrong.  At 100% hit, a warrior gains 162.5% of his ap bonus for white DPS with additional returns due to flurry, special moves, and crits.  14 ap is not a 1 DPS increase.  General predictions put it around 4-5 dps based on a .35 dps per AP return.  1% hit leads to an increase of white damage portion of your attack.  You would need a WWS report to even guesstimate what kind of increase that is.  1% crit also increases flurry uptime, stacks with impale, and generates more rage from white hits.  I did a brief test of AP versus Crit to see what was more beneficial to stack a couple pages back and the crossover point (crit scaling and ap being a flat return) was somewhere around 4500 sustained AP.<br>
<br>
 33% crit has nothing to do with perma flurry.  There is no permaflurry.  Your flurry uptime asymptotically increases 100% as your crit rate approaches 100%.  Your flurry up time rises dramatically from 0% crit to 10% crit.  It rises less rapidly form 10% to 20%.  It rises yet more slowly from 20% to 30%.  Raid buffed up in the upper 30s or low 40s, your flurry uptime only creeps up with more crit.  33% is in no way a magic number.<br>
<br>
My personal set would be 200 hit rating basically entirely from base gear stats with 30% zerker crit and as much AP as I can jam onto that gear.  If my gear adds up to 190 rating, so be it.  If I'm at 240 rating, that doesn't hurt.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I believe your math is off. We want to calculate the difference between damage with BF and damage without BF.<br>
<br>
The first equation should be ( ( damage.physical * 1.04 ) - damage.physical ), which can be simplified to ( damage.physical * 0.04 ).<br>
<br>
The second equation should be ( damage.physical - ( damage.physical / 1.04 ) ).<br>
<br>
Note that it's not as simple as taking the total damage done by physical DPS classes and applying the formula. Abilities such as rogue poisons, serpent sting, and shocks are not affected by BF and need to be removed from the total before calculating.</div>

	</table>
</div>Indeed, the equations are incorrect, I'll edit my post. The formulas were snagged from a post earlier on in the thread, I never thought to double check them.<br>
<br>
And yes, it's not that simple, however from all the logs and WWS I've looked through poison damage and (lol) serpent sting and the like produce almost negligable damage, 1-2% of the total damage being added with a sweeping formula. Obviously if you want an exact number it would be best to dig through recap or WWS and manually add everything up, but for the 15-20 DPS being mistakenly added if even that I'm not overly concerned. That said, Scorpid poison can add up to a pretty large amount so that's definitely worth taking out.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I also did not state that the warrior in question had 100% hit, nowhere close to that. I said for the sake of the argument that they had 95 hit rating. 95 hit rating is not the same as 100% hit.

If we were to use the numbers you provided, combined with some information from my own warrior:<br>
<br>
My warrior has about 66% of his dps being generated by white damage. If you want to propose that 1% hit applies to only increasing your white damage, then 1% hit should increase total dps by 0.66%.<br>
At 1000 dps, that's 6.66 dps.<br>
<br>
I'd like to know the exact circumstances that you view 14 AP as being equal to 4-5 dps, there are a lot of factors that would go into this. I also stated that for the sake of simplicity, we would overlook the fact that AP factors into other dps components. If I didn't state this in my post, then forgive me because I meant to.<br>
<br>
Regardless of these facts, why don't we increase the numbers then to something more in line with what some warriors have been able to put out as steady dps. 1500-1600 isn't unreasonable for a warrior with good gear in a relatively non threat-sensitive fight. At this point, 1% hit still amounts to 1% of their white damage increase. which is now closer to 11 dps increase, while AP remains at the flat amount of (taking your numbers) 4-5 dps. this would mean you need 28 AP to equal 16 hit rating. Granted that this is still a better trade-off gem-wise, go ahead and take the strength gems. What I was trying to point out in my post, which I realize now that I seem to have done ineffectively, was that while Crit and Hit scale over a % of your total dps, AP scales at a flat rate.<br>
<br>
Again I want to point out that I'm not trying to say that you should unreasonably stack the "cheaper" alternative to dps increase, but rather that at certain levels, some stats are more valuable than others, and that certainly on a basic level of understanding, crit and hit are an apparently much easier way to increase dps than strength.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>You can do all the math you want, but when choosing gear, once you hit the hit rating required to never miss a special, then get the best item available to you for every slot, or the slot that is the biggest upgrade.  As a warrior I would never gem for hit, but I will gladly pick up pieces with hit rating on them, if they are the best for a particular slot.  For example, with my ideal setup I will have 315 hit rating, but I didn't try for such a high number, it just came naturally.  AP also scales with hit and crit, it becomes more valuable.<br>

What I'm saying is that when it comes to stats that you can pick and choose for, hit and crit come above strength for me. Again, while the +hit may come with the gear, the gear doesn't come immediately. For the time between point A and point B, the gems you choose have an impact on your immediate dps. So while you may not gem for hit in the end, do you gem for hit in the intermediate. And my point here is that yes, gem for hit and crit rather than stacking AP.<br>

I'm arms in PVP now, but I've never done Arms in anything more than a 5 man. The question I guess is how much dps can an arms warrior manage to do in a raid setting if they don't have a shaman dropping WF for them? We only have one enhancement shaman and he's not always there. 1-2 elementals, but they generally go with caster groups or the tank group right now if the mts need more dodge (like for Gruul)<br>

Basically looking at Kaidenn here. What could I advise to help him up his damage on this? 370 dps over the instance looks low.

</div>Your gear is fine to at least get 900+, keep WW and BT on cooldown, keep rampage up at all times, and spam HS to burn extra rage.  It's more of a priority system as a fury warrior, not really a set attack rotation.  Use HS only when you know you will be able to get your WW+BT off the instant they come off cooldown.  Also make sure that your groups are set up properly (our typical setup is warrior/rogue/rogue/shaman/feral, and you are using sunder/faerie fire/curse of recklessness, and maybe change around people's specs like survival hunters/enhancement shaman to increase overall raid dps.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I'm definitely a contender for the 1st or 2nd pair for Warglaives, provided we ever get to Illidan. ^^ But then I have almost 100% raid attendance, why would I pass for somebody with much lower raid attendance? Or why would somebody have priority over me because of their class? Heh.<br>

		<div id="post_message_482910">"Nowhere did I state that 33% crit chance guaranteed 100% flurry uptime, I merely stated that this is the number that is generally associated with the "optimum" uptime. The point at which added crit comes at such a low value for further flurry uptime that this added side-effect is overlooked."<br>
<br>
The core of my point is that the flurry uptime equation is a smooth curve.  There is no inflection or point beyond which you can definitely say you are getting less.  Weapon speed can influence flurry uptime by a few percent.  I have heard 25% crit, 28% crit, 30% crit, and 33% crit as cited goals.  How you would determine your optimum crit would be 100% dependend on the gear you are using, the raid buffs you expect, and what kind of calculation you make on your rotation to say at some point the itemization cost of crit dips below strength.  And, actually, strength generally outweighs crit until 4k ap.  I have the amount of crit I have because of the gear base stats, spec, and number of yellow gem slots (4 str/4crit).  It seems to be enough.  My approach to crit will likely stay that way.<br>
<br>
"I also did not state that the warrior in question had 100% hit, nowhere close to that. I said for the sake of the argument that they had 95 hit rating. 95 hit rating is not the same as 100% hit. In addition, I did say that the numbers were rough, perhaps you mistook how "rough" I intended them to be."<br>
<br>
You stated that at 100 dps, 14 ap is a 1% increase and then used that to say that at 1000 dps, it takes 140 ap to be a 1% increase.  That, for various reasons is wrong.  For a DW warrior negating misses and the other events I mentioned like crits/haste/specials, you get a 162.5% return on AP on white attacks.  This means that 14 ap would already be worth 1.625 dps.  Now you factor in specials, haste, and crit which enhance AP value while adding in misses/glances/dodges which decrease it.  I'll break it down later.<br>
<br>
"My warrior has about 66% of his dps being generated by white damage. If you want to propose that 1% hit applies to only increasing your white damage, then 1% hit should increase total dps by 0.66%.<br>
At 1000 dps, that's 6.66 dps."<br>
<br>
My white damage breakdown is in the low 40s and dipping.  The harder I hit, the more rage I have, the more MH swings I turn into heroic strikes.  Increasing my gear, AP, haste, and synergy will only enhance this effect.  Also, a 1% +hit is not 1% more white damage.  If you hit 90% of the time with no glances and no crits, you would see a 1/.9 percent increase.  That's more than 1%.  If you crit 90% of the time (all of your hits), that would be a 1/1.8 increase which is less than 1%.  This is where WWS logs come in handy as you can look directly at how much you can gain from a particular stat change.<br>
<br>
"I'd like to know the exact circumstances that you view 14 AP as being equal to 4-5 dps, there are a lot of factors that would go into this. I also stated that for the sake of simplicity, we would overlook the fact that AP factors into other dps components. If I didn't state this in my post, then forgive me because I meant to."<br>
<br>
The .35 dps per AP point I cite is from a thread on AP to DPS returns for all classes.  I never calculated it persay, but it does represent something someone thought about so it's likely a fair ballpark number.  Other classes like Enh Shaman and rogues were close but lower on rates of returns.  You know the rogues spent 94283402893 hours on that.<br>
<br>
Lets say you have the following stats:  35% crit, 85% total hit (15% = misses + dodges), and 3k ap.  I don't have this much hit in a raid but I also usually have more AP.  I have 2717 ap while farming so maybe 3k raidbuffed is low.  I think they're middling values for guys doing TK/SSC but before haste gear and armor penetration.  Either way, it's a good start.<br>
<br>
I'm going to ignore partial percents as this is just ballpark napkin math.  Use 2.4 speed 93 dps weapons but don't match them on flurry.<br>
<br>
You hit 95% of your BTs for 35% crit (with impale) and 60% hits.  We'll use 10% armor reduction (90% damage).  You do this every 6 seconds.  This is .35*3000*.45*2.2*.9 + .6*3000*.45*.9 = 1665 average damage or 277.4 dps&gt;<br>
<br>
You hit 95% of your WWs for 35% crit (with impale) and 60% hits.  You do this every 9 seconds.  .35*(3000*2.4/14+93*2.4)*.9*2.2+.6*(3000*2.4/14+93*2.4)*.9 = 909.3 damage or 101 dps.<br>
<br>
White attacks:  First we have to predict your flurry time.  Flurry will be affect on the number of specials versus the number of average swings.  Assuming all attacks are flurried and that misses do not use flurry charges (someone told me this and I haven't proven it out), your flurry time is the time for 3 successful hits at 2.4/1.25 speed, dw.  This is 3.39 seconds.  (3*2.4/1.25/.85/2 = 3.39 seconds).  During that time you attempt 3.39/6 bts and 3.39/9 wws.  I'll ignore hamstrings.  Thats .942 extra swings.  You attempt 2.4/3.39 mh swings (unflurried for lower value) for .2*2.4/3.39 WF procs.  1.08 total bonus swings.  Flurry uptime = 1-(1-.35)^(3+1.08) = 82.7%.  In practice, this may be high (maybe the misses/dodges do use charges) or low (spamstring).  It's not completely out of line.  Your average swing speed is then 82.7% of 2.4/1.25 plus 17.3% of 2.4 which is 2.00.  Luckily, that's a nice number.<br>
<br>
Your MH dps is [.35*(3000*2.4/14+93*2.4)*2+.24*.75*(3000*2.4/14+93*2.4)+.26*(3000*2.4/14+93*2.4)]*.9/2<br>
Your OH dps is MH dps *.625<br>
MH:  378.33  OH:  236.46<br>
<br>
Your Total DPS is BT DPS + WW DPS + MH DPS + OH DPS.  <br>
<br>
992.4 DPS total.  I can recalc all this for a few more AP and find the change.<br>
<br>
Some notes:  AP costs half the amount on items as hit rating or any rating.  When given as str, the expect raid AP of a warrior from 1 str is between 2.42 and 2.66 (with and without UR).  I'll crunch some more numbers.  This is where I get my understanding of the value of AP.<br>
<br>
Edit:  So I put the above into Excel for some quick testing.  Using the preceeding stats, making the following singular changes lead to the following DPSs.<br>
<br>
2.7 speed weapons:  1006.3 dps (0)<br>
Using 2.4 speed 95 DPS weapons:  997.1 DPS (??)<br>
Adding 20 AP:  996.8 DPS (7.51/8.26)<br>
Adding 10 hit rating:  995.8 DPS (10)<br>
Adding 10 crit rating:  997.1 DPS (10)<br>
<br>
The cost of each change is in paranthesis.  AP can be from strength with kings and imp zerker with or without unleashed rage.  Lower number is with.<br>
DPS per itemization point:  <br>
AP:  .533/.586 (higher is with unleashed rage)<br>
Hit:  .34<br>
Crit:  .47</div>

I'd like to note that "point for point" strength &gt; crit &gt; hit is a pretty rough statement to make. As well as the fact that hit past 5% is not useless for arms, hit past roughly 8.6% is "useless."</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Goes by a guild to guild basis.<br>
<br>
I'm definitely a contender for the 1st or 2nd pair for Warglaives, provided we ever get to Illidan. ^^ But then I have almost 100% raid attendance, why would I pass for somebody with much lower raid attendance? Or why would somebody have priority over me because of their class? Heh.<br>
<br>
Like I said, guild to guild basis.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</div>Maybe someone wouldn't have priority *purely* based on class.  You're not gonna hear, "So, yeah, we are trying this new recruit and he's a rogue, guess he gets the Illidan sword over our warrior with 100% attendance for 2 years who gets #1 damage all the time".<br>
<br>
You're more likely to hear, "Rogue A and Warrior B have comparable attendance and dedication, but Rogue A does more damage in 99% of fights and isn't threat capped like Warrior B, so it would be better to go to Rogue A".  (This is all hypothetical, maybe you are wrecking the rogues in every fight and they cry themselves to sleep at night.)<br>
<br>
In a perfect world, with a perfect raid group, with raiders who all play their classes to the fullest potential, the warglaives are probably better suited as rogue weapons.<br>
<br>
However, in a real raid, it definitely depends on your people.  In my guild, we have 2 rogues on the roster.  There is no backup rogue.  We've both been raiding with the guild for over 2 years and rarely miss a raid.  In fights that aren't excessively melee-hostile (or maybe excessively AoE friendly), you can expect us to be 1 and 2 on damage (barring random fluke death).  If/when we kill Illidan and see warglaives, I sincerely hope that one of us will get them.<br>
<br>
But maybe Emeraude's rogues aren't as dedicated.  Maybe they are underperforming.  Maybe his guild has had a lot of rogues burn out and is constantly recruiting new ones, while he is there every raid delivering a top-notch performance.<br>
<br>
There are certainly circumstances under which a warrior would get first crack at the warglaives, but it seems most guilds who have gotten the drops have had a reliable and top-performing rogue to give them to.</div>

</div>Quixotic is correct.  At the T6 level threat is not that much of an issue.<br>
<br>
Only a few fights are threat limited for warriors:<br>
 - RoS due to 45 second pure damage burn + DW/Bloodlust/Reck/Haste potion<br>
 - Bloodboil, but everyone is limited here so it's no different for warriors<br>
 - Council (marginally threat limited, but it's a slow-and-steady fight by design)<br>
 - Rage Winterchill if you get lucky with the Death &amp; Decay (who cares)<br>
<br>
White/Heroic damage is equally valuable to fury warriors &amp; rogues so the haste bonus proc of the weapon is of equal value.  The "rogue centric" part of this weapon is the high top end for sinister strikes, but warriors also benefit highly from a slow MH.<br>
<br>
Notably, the T5 encounters are typically more threat limited by design.</div>

Its 100% sure a rogue benefits more,but yes attendance and performance must be considered. I checked the warglaive warriors guild,a rogue has them allready leaving 2 rogues open for the next drop.The one has daggers and might actually love combat dagger(yeah i know its over the top) and the other could just have lost the raid with the warglaives dropping.Since the warrior got 1 he gets auto priority for the next piece.Haha just a crazy scenario.I know if i would stay in my old guild i would even get a shot.</div>

</div>Yes I can go pretty much full-throttle on the bosses I didn't mention in my previous post (Najentus/Teron/Anetheron) after the first 10-20 seconds of the fight.  The tricky part is using death wish early enough for it to pop up again @ 19%, but not too early that you push threat limits at the beginning of the fight.  <br>
<br>
Recently, our enhancement shaman has helped the melee group by totem-twisting windfury &amp; tranquil air for the first 30ish seconds of the fight.  This let's us go full throttle fairly early on.  If  I manage threat properly I am still close to pulling aggro at the end of execute range, but that's my goal.  For reference my personal bests on the encounters you mentioned are 1353 for Najentus, 1800 for Teron, and 1762 for Anetheron.</div>

</div>First bit - correct.  I should have stated "until 4k ap."  I can't pinpoint the point of change but it was around 4200 ap for my napkin math simulations.  In actuality I wouldn't be surpised to see it several hundred ap in either direction.<br>
<br>
Second bit - not what I was saying.  The value I listed was for the dps increase divided by the itemization cost.  Having UR up increases the amount of AP you get from 1 strength which decreases the itemization cost of 20 ap and enhances the rate of return for AP.</div>

</div>It's not very easy for a resto shaman to totem twist.  Totem twisting costs a lot of mana.  The enhancement shaman has the advantage of seemingly unlimited mana with JoW and shamanistic rage and are not always on their GCD due to ability timers.  Conversely, a resto shaman will have much more limited mana and need to heal on almost every GCD.   For these reasons I've never asked a non-enhancement shaman to totem twist for us, but instead just ask them to drop tranq for 20-30 seconds then switch to WF.<br>
<br>
Edit: You should also make sure that your hunters are using Misdirection whenever it is up.</div>

I do have a question though.

However on Bosses I do notice me missing a lot, to the point where I don't have enough rage to keep my rotation going, even without the HS spam. I was wondering if fury warriors need more hit than 155 to keep sustaned rage flow on bosses, or if fury warriors need different gear sets (one for trash, one for bosses with more hit). I have seen several posts about only 95 hit being required, but I can't imagine all the misses that would be going on and all the lack of rage resulting from it.<br>

		<div id="post_message_484244">What are your general stats?  I'm only working with 181 hit rating and I know on bosses if all I do is BT/WW, I will be sitting at 100 rage all the time.  Trash might be a couple levels lower and thus your hit percent is a couple higher, but it's not a huge difference.  Some of it is the amount of collateral damage on trash, especially the mage mobs.  On a lot of pulls, I can't WW because there are sheep hiding everywhere so my rage is fairly full on the first mob of a pack.  After that, I worry less about aggro and start dumping hard into HSes.<br>
<br>
On Hydross I tank as the continuous aggro resets would hurt my dps fairly hard and I bothered to get the resists for add tanking.  On Lurker, the a zerk rage + whirl equals nice bonus rage.  On Tidewalker, zerker rage + quake gets you some good rage.  On FLK, there isn't a lot of collateral damage to use.  On Leo I dodge whirlwind fairly early so that's rarely a good dps fight for me.  Vashj you're back to taking damage for rage.  On a straight boss with no incoming damage, though, I usually WW, BT, and then HS a couple times when both are on CD such as Mag.  Can't really say I have rage generation issues.  I could see rage dumping to 10-15 rage and then missing 6 straight times.  If I go for a BT and are short rage, I just pop bloodrage.  Even on a miss streak, that should get you where you need to be.</div>

		<div id="post_message_484252">I think it might prove useful for a highly experienced and knowledgeable [fury] warrior to start up a thread akin to Malan's Enhancement Shaman thread (viewed <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304035441/http://elitistjerks.com/f31/t13297-enhance_shaman_collected_works_theorycraft_vol_i/" target="_blank">here</a>).<br>
<br>
The question about 'how much hit should I shoot for' seems to be a common plague considering the answer is repeatedly the same. To answer the question, however, the importance is that all specials never miss- everything beyond that is typically achieved through whatever gear supplements.<br>
<br>
I'd be interested in seeing a thread that discusses achieving 'perma-flurry', values of AP versus crit (they are mutual but both apply in very significant forms to the fury tree), etc. I suppose one can dig through the warrior spreadsheet and this thread along with other places, but I for one wouldn't mind seeing and contributing to a cataloged version.<br>
<br>
On the topic of DPS warriors- I have a gear question I'm sure some of you might be able to answer. My apologies if this specific question has been asked before, I found nothing on it. It concerns <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304035441/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=30446" target="_blank">Solarian's Sapphire</a><br>
Now, this item is subject to a warrior's Commanding Presence, boosting its raw value. My guild usually runs a melee group setup as follows: Enh Sham, DPS Warr, Rogue, Rogue, Rogue.<br>
In the hands of a warrior with imp shouts, the 70ap becomes 87.5ap. Now, applied to the enh shammy's Unleashed Rage, this would result to a further gain of 96.25ap. Apply a warrior's Imp Zerk Stance or a rogue's Deadliness, and the return would become 105.875ap to the individual. My question is, do all of these stack? Already, there is a collective gain of 481.25ap to the group via imp shouts and Unleashed Rage alone.</div>

		<div id="post_message_484455">A little bit off the subject, but the right thread I believe.. I just started Fury spec this week(17/44/0) for raiding and although I am loving the steady damage output although I am not sure if I am using the right weapons per my spec/attributes. Currently; 32%crit, 167hit, 1875AP and I am using MH Netherblade(From Alar) and OH AS2 Sword(the 1.5delay one). I have looked at some other Warriors and they are using 2 slow weapons. I know pre-bc most Warriors went with Slow/Fast. But now in BC this is new to me. 2 Slow weapons? Is there reason behind this? With high enough AP/crit I don't see why 2 Slow weapons would be a problem, but the general trend is Slow/Fast.<br>
<br>
I maintained a solid 920dps on Morogrim this week(although I did not get to go completely all out because of MT aggro generation). I do feel room for improvement and was thinking maybe going with Talon from Alar or Talon from Morogrim for MH, and OH the Netherblade instead of the AS2 Sword. Is this worthwhile to do, or should I just stay with the trend Fast/Slow combo?</div>

As most Warrior DPS topics and posts found, this is a gray area that I never have seen discussed in great detail, such as acceptable loss in stats to achieve high static haste.<br>
<br>
Since I have reached BT and tried to go the haste route though my AP took a 130 point drop, 4% was lost from crit dropping me to 27% and around 800 health for only a 10% static haste ( which will be nerfed some in this next patch ).

Also I noticed most Fury Warriors that have completed both instances wear very little to none or they are always wearing two-handed gear set ups.<br>

If anyone has or still uses a full haste gear set, what were your impressions and was it worth the loss of stats? After the patch is it still worth it?<br>

</div>After the patch, you need the same haste rating per percent attack speed increase as you need hit rating per percent hitchance increase.<br>
As soon as 1% of your average damage per strike exceeds 1% of your char screen average damage, one haste rating is better than one hit rating. (I assume you're yellow hit-capped in BT easily anyway)<br>
In other words, if your crit damage gain exceeds your damage loss from miss, dodge and glancings, you get a better benefit out of haste rating than hit rating.<br>
If you add in Heroic Strike which should be hit-capped already, haste rating gets even better.<br>
<br>
The bigger problem is a comparison of white damage only increasing stats(hit rating and haste rating) to stats increasing white and yellow damage(crit rating, attack power and armor ignore).<br>
<br>
The second problem is that haste gear is generally worse itemized than other gear, most of the haste gear has only two damage stats (haste and attack power) while other items have three or four (attack power, crit, hit and armor ignore).</div>

</div>I am 17/44.  I think Haste procs are still very good but I do not think, with the 2.2 changes, passive haste is a very good stat when evaluating it from the item budget perspective.  I would go with the following:<br>
<br>
Unstoppable Agressor+Ring of 1000 marks<br>
<br>
Bracers of Eradication<br>
<br>
Blood-stained Pauldrons<br>
<br>
Grips of Silent Justice<br>
<br>
Red Belt of Battle<br>
<br>
I would also mention the following gear you did not, but have access to based on your other choices:<br>
<br>
Band of the Ranger-General.  This is 1000 marks but better.<br>
<br>
Deadly Cuffs.  Leather...but better than the three you mentioned.<br>
<br>
The Anetheron belt, and perhaps the Vashj belt, both leather, are a tad better than Red Belt of Battle but given how easy the Red Belt is to get...it may not make sense to upgrade depending on your loot system.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">When you are in the 3.5-3.8 speed range it's not a big difference. However faster then 2.5 (post flurry/haste of course) will hurt your DPS. Granted, there aren't very many 2h weapons that are faster then 3.5, also with the somewhat limited choices in end-game 2h's most people take whatever drops first.</div>

	</tr>
	</table>
</div>you are confusing 2 seperate issues which are discussed in the guide.  <br>
<br>
1. You should not let your flurried weapon speed go below 2.5+lag because then you will not have enough time for 1 global cooldown in between slams.  This is not a sliding scale.  Anything  above 2.5+lag has the same effect here.<br>
<br>
2. Since slam is not normalized, doesnt it mean that slower weapons are better for a slam build?  He tries to use math to answer this question and arrives at the answer that weapon speed makes no different, even if slam is not normalized. This is because with a slower weapon, while you get harder slam hits, you also get less frequent slam hits because there is more time in between auto attacks.  He shows that these 2 things cancel eachother out (almost like blizzard intended it and that is why they dont normalize slam).  <br>
<br>
Again, they are 2 separate issues.  The only thing they have in common is that they related to weapon speed.</div>

				</div>
				<div style="font-style:italic">You can't calculate the values of damage per threat like that. You have to include the bonus damage in the threat done to compare Cleave and HS (they both do more threat than just the bonus threat). It seems you are right however, including the white damage part of HS/Cleave seems to indicate that if your average swing damage is greater than around 140 Cleave becomes better than HS in terms of damage/threat (and Imp. Cleave is better already with 0 swing damage).<br>
<br>
If you include 130 swing damage you get damage/threat values like this:<br>
HS: damage/threat = 306/(306+196) = 0.610<br>
Cleave: 200/(200+130) = 0.606<br>
=&gt; i.e. HS is better than Cleave<br>
If you assume a 150 swing damage:<br>
HS: damage/threat = 326/(326+196) = 0.624<br>
Cleave: 220/(220+130) = 0.629<br>
=&gt; Cleave is better.<br>
<br>
Not sure I went wrong somewhere, but this is actually quite interesting, I never thought that including the swing damage could make such a difference.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</div>Your calculations are incorrect because they compare the final damage values instead of the bonus damage values.<br>
<br>
Raw threat generated per damage point dealt is the same no matter what attack we use.  What we need to compare is "How much harder will I hit with HS instead of a white attack" vs. "How much harder will I hit with Cleave instead of a white attack".  You need to calculate the expected damage of an attack, including chances to miss, hit, glance, and crit based on the attack table.<br>
<br>
To put this in an equation:<br>
<br>
Note: Let ED() represent expected damage of an attack.<br>
<br>
Threat Efficiency(HS) = [ED(HS) - ED(white)] / [Threat(HS ability threat*)]<br>
Threat Efficiency(Cleave) = [ED(Cleave) - ED(white)] / [Threat(Cleave ability threat*)]<br>
<br>
The more "threat efficient" attack will depend on your gear.  Period.<br>
<br>
(E) * Ability threat refers to the 'useless threat' caused by using the ability.  This does not include the threat caused by the damage portion of the attack.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">My question is: How do you guys rate haste and how important is it to pursue in gearing as a Fury Warrior? As most Warrior DPS topics and posts found, this is a gray area that I never have seen discussed in great detail, such as acceptable loss in stats to achieve high static haste.<br>
<br>
Since I have reached BT and tried to go the haste route though my AP took a 130 point drop, 4% was lost from crit dropping me to 27% and around 800 health for only a 10% static haste ( which will be nerfed some in this next patch ).  Granted I have limited access to the complete gear from both BT / Hyjal to balance my stats, but is haste really worth it? Also I noticed most Fury Warriors that have completed both instances wear very little to none or they are always wearing two-handed gear set ups.<br>
<br>
<br>
If anyone has or still uses a full haste gear set, what were your impressions and was it worth the loss of stats? After the patch is it still worth it?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Finally, sorry about all the questions in this one post regarding haste, when choosing your gear which of the follow options would you take?<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Rings</b><br>
Band of Devastation vs Ring of 1000 marks vs Ring of Lethality vs Unstoppable Aggressors Ring <br>
<br>
<b>Bracers</b><br>
Swift Steel Bracer  vs Furious Shackles vs Bracer of Eradication<br>
<br>
<b>Shoulders</b><br>
Swift Steel Shoulders vs  Onslaught Shoulder Blades vs Blood-stained Pauldrons vs Destroyer Shoulderblades<br>
<br>
<b>Gloves</b><br>
Onslaught Gauntlets vs Pillager's gauntlets vs Grips of Silent Justice<br>
<br>
<b>Belt</b><br>
Red Belt of Battle vs Belt of Seething Fury<br>
<br>
<br>
I believe this is pretty much all the haste gear slots w/o going into weapons.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Any ways, hopefully someone who has a much better understanding then me or who has already experienced trying to full haste gear set up wouldn't mind taking their time to comment on this for me.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Thanks in advance,<br>

</div>I have zero hands on experience with the haste gear, but after the upcoming nerf, unless someone can actually show comparisons with the gear they have, I'd rather just go after the same old AP, Crit, Hit gear with some armor pen or haste on one or two items.  I am not going to chase haste like I would have previously.<br>

				The bigger problem is a comparison of white damage only increasing stats(hit rating and haste rating) to stats increasing white and yellow damage(crit rating, attack power and armor ignore).  The second problem is that haste gear is generally worse itemized than other gear, most of the haste gear has only two damage stats (haste and attack power) while other items have three or four (attack power, crit, hit and armor ignore).

		<div id="post_message_487666">@that rumor with slam dps being weapon speed independant:<br>
That isn't true at all, a little example with a very big speed difference to show the point for scaling only (so it doesn't include additional slam damage):<br>
<u><br>
Weapon 1:</u> 100 damage per hit, 1.0 attackspeed, 10 rage per hit<br>
<u>Weapon 2:</u> 200 damage per hit, 2.0 attackspeed, 20 rage per hit<br>
<u>Weapon 3:</u> 400 damage per hit, 4.0 attackspeed, 40 rage per hit<br>
<br>
With a cast time of 0.7 for slam(due to lagg) and a rage cost of 15, you get the following results:<br>
<u>Weapon 1:</u><br>
3 hits for 100 damage each generating 10 rage each having an interval of 1 second each<br>
2 slams for 100 damage each costing 15 rage each having a cast time of 0.7 seconds each<br>
<br>
Total: 500 damage in 4.4 seconds (=113,64 dps) with 0 excess rage per second<br>
<br>
<u>Weapon 2:</u><br>
1 hit for 200 damage generating 20 rage having an interval of 2 seconds<br>
1 slam for 200 damage costing 15 rage having a cast time of 0.7 seconds<br>
<br>
Total: 400 damage in 2.7 seconds (=148.15 dps) with 1.85 excess rage per second<br>
<br>
<u>Weapon 3:</u><br>
1 hit for 400 damage generating 40 rage having an interval of 4 seconds<br>
1 slam for 400 damage costing 15 rage having a cast time of 0.7 seconds<br>
<br>
Total: 800 damage in 4.7 seconds (=170,21 dps) with 5,32 excess rage per second<br>
<br>
As long as slam's cast time and rage cost don't scale with weapon speed, slower weapons will always be better for slam dps.</div>

As a MS Warrior I'll try going for some haste as it increases not only white damage but also slam damage but even then it's probably not going to make a difference to ordinary stats at all.</div>

</div>Sure, you are right that the expected damage is what should be used here (I assumed the expected damage to be 130/150 damage), BUT in your calculations you use Threat(HS) = 196. This is not true, the full threat from HS is Damage + Bonus threat (and the same for Cleave). So if I try to make a better formula to compute threat efficiency (calculated as the the ratio of damage (HS - white) and threat (HS - white)), I would use:<br>
<br>
Threat Efficiency(HS) = [ED(HS) - ED(white)] / [Threat(HS) - Threat(white)]=<br>
[ED(HS) - ED(white)] / [Bonusthreat(HS) + ED(HS) - ED(white)]<br>
<br>
So if I say that ED(HS) - ED(white) is 376 (this means that, on average, a HS hit will do 376 more damage than a white hit), I get:<br>
TE(HS) = 376 / (196+376) = 0.66<br>
<br>
For Cleave, the amount of extra damage from the hit/crit will not be the same. This is because a crit with cleave will add less damage than a crit with HS (70*2 vs 176*2), The difference depend on your crit rate. Using my gear and checking the damage in my spreadsheet, Cleave will cause approximately 220 more damage than a white hit. Then:<br>
TE(Cleave) = 220 / (220+130) = 0.63<br>
<br>
And I find that HS is a little bit better. In terms of damage/rage Cleave has no chance vs single target ofc.<br>
<br>
This will of course change with gear, it's not easy to calculate without using spreadsheets (which I've done here).<br>

</div>These complications to the formula are unnecessary.  The threat from the extra damage <b>does not matter.</b>  The raw damage-&gt;threat conversion is the same no matter what ability you use.  For comparison of heroic strike and cleave, the only thing that matters is the *useless threat* generated by the abilities themselves.<br>

You can, however, raise this cap by adding hit. Every 1% hit you add increases the crit cap by the same amount. Since there are no ways to reduce the dodge or glancing rates (except possibly weapon skill, who’s effects are still relatively unclear), there is a maximum amount of crit you can stack. This occurs for white attacks when you have capped your hit, which means the maximum useful amount of crit occurs at 49.4%. Note that yellow attacks have a much higher cap since they only have a 9% miss rate and they cannot glance."<br>

<br>
Note on crit cap.  I think you might have just misstyped or didn't think about this.  The crit cap at 0 hit rating for white attacks is 42.4%.  This is 100% minus 28, minus 5.6, minus 24.  Looking at your hit table, it would be the addition of the hits (77.6-100 or 22.4) with the crits, 20.  As DW, raidbuffed with LoTP and consumables, even mongoose procs don't put me over 42.4% (starting from around 31-32%).  Adding hit will raise the crit cap from 42.4% but it's not as immediate an impedment as it used to be.  Using just the base 9% hit, your crit cap is over 50%.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">These complications to the formula are unnecessary.  The threat from the extra damage <b>does not matter.</b>  The raw damage-&gt;threat conversion is the same no matter what ability you use.  For comparison of heroic strike and cleave, the only thing that matters is the *useless threat* generated by the abilities themselves.</div>

	</tr>
	</table>
</div>I don't agree, the extra damage produced by these abilities will also also produce more threat than a white swing, that means that you <b>have</b> to include that in the total threat produced by the ability to get the correct maths. The total threat from HS is more than from Cleve due to to two reasons, one being the extra added threat (196 vs 130), the other one being the extra added raw damage (176 vs 70). You can't just use the bonus threat to compare them. <br>

</div>Well I do agree with you, using Cleave or HS is not that easy to work out. I get the "expected damage" from a spreadsheet that does all the hit/crit calculations for me. This means that I can easily calculate these numbers for any given gear setup. I just don't think the formula you use is the correct one to get threat efficiencies.</div>

</div>Let me try spelling it out a little differently.  Total threat = (damage + bonus) * modifiers.  We can agree on this, yes?  HS threat = (damage + 176 [bonus damage] + 196 [threat bonus]) * mods.  Cleave threat = (damage + 70 [bonus damage] + 130 [threat bonus]) * mods.  The bonus damage is reflected directly in the combat log; there is no need to add additional bonus threat.<br>
<br>
Yes, you are right that HS produces more threat than Cleave.  But you do not have to add TWO bonuses onto the damage the ability causes to get the actual threat created, which is what you are arguing for.</div>

The abilities also do extra damage (on average) because they miss less and don't glance. This is what I try to use in the Expected damage differences.</div>

</div>My calculations show which is more threat efficient in terms of the wasted "extra" threat from the ability itself.  <br>
<br>
If you want to calculate TOTAL threat efficiency, as you said, you certainly have to include the threat caused by the damage.  But that isn't necessary in order to decide which attack is more threat efficient because the raw damage-to-threat ratio is a constant.  The only variables between the two abilities are the wasted threat and the expected damage.</div>

		<div id="post_message_490533">Personally, I feel the problem with threat caps (for various classes) has less to do with their innate skills or abilities, but moreso with the fact that tank threat scales very poorly.

So while most classes can put upgrades to use in their bottom line (DPS numbers) a tank rarely sees anything substancial that will increase their rage/threat generation.  (Not to mention the flawed mechanic by which the more damage you mitigate the less threat you generate.)  As a tank gets upgrades, their threat output tends to increase very little.<br>
<br>
However, what I would like to see when the level cap is raised (and talents are reworked) would be a talent/ability to reduce threat in battle/zerker stance by X.  (Say 5%, to a max of 10% for 2 talent points, something that would be 'on use' - so that it would not impact the ability of a DPS warrior to tank an instance.)  I think DPS warriors are too hard on themselves since they do a great job of doing DPS in a situation where the threat ceiling is low.  (IE, 110% vs 130% for ranged)  I think the only class more screwed over by threat are the shamans.</div>

</div>There are counter-argument to this.  Advantages of "mostly static" threat with gear:<br>
<br>
1) Boss tuning can be done more easily since the threat caps are more constant<br>
2) TPS is more skill-based than gear based, letting lesser-geared tanks put out enough TPS for raiding<br>
3) The Dev's don't have to worry about threat scaling out of control for highly geared warriors, which could potentially make threat meaningless if nobody had to worry about it.<br>
<br>
However, what I do NOT like is when tank threat actually decreases with gear due to mitigation.  Better gear leads to more mitigation, more mitigation reduces damage, less damage produces less rage, and finally less rage produces less threat.  This chain of events has our tank actually downgrading his tanking gear or purposely not putting up debuffs like Tclap in order to get hit enough to build rage.  Frankly, this mechanic sucks.</div>

</div>Well, the difference in expected damage means that also the threat from damage produced by the two abilities are different. You're correct in that the only two variables are bonus threat and expected damage, but the expected damage difference enters in two places in the efficiency. If this difference wouldn't make a difference the resulting threat efficiency should be the same regardless if you use only the bonus threat or the total threat. This is not the case.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I guess we just disagree, not much point discussing it further <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080107152012im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/wink.gif" border="0" alt="" title=";)" class="inlineimg"></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Well, the difference in expected damage means that also the threat from damage produced by the two abilities are different. You're correct in that the only two variables are bonus threat and expected damage, but the expected damage difference enters in two places in the efficiency. If this difference wouldn't make a difference the resulting threat efficiency should be the same regardless if you use only the bonus threat or the total threat. This is not the case.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I guess we just disagree, not much point discussing it further <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080107152012im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/wink.gif" border="0" alt="" title=";)" class="inlineimg"></div>

	</table>
</div>To put an end to this discussion, I've created a spreadsheet to model the threat efficiency of Heroic Strike vs. Cleave.  It has a few variables you can use including crit rate and mob armor %.<br>
<br>
I've used both my calculation (Bonus dmg / ability threat) and your calculation (Bonus dmg / Ability threat + bonus dmg threat) to prove that they give you the same result.  Both calculations have Heroic strike &amp; Cleave efficiencies intersecting at the same point.  As I've said, the more efficient attack is the same regardless if you use the bonus threat or the total threat.<br>

				-Heroic strike will always be more rage efficient														<br>
-The two abilities have very similar threat efficiency for the 100-200 range										<br>
-There are two graphs here to prove that the intersection of threat efficiency (where one becomes more efficient than the other) is independent of the raw +damage bonus provided to the abilities (e.x. 176 for HS).  You can change this number and it will move the intersection point, but both calculations result in the same intersection														<br>
-You may adjust the armor, crit rate, ability bonus, and ability threat in cells B64-B69.														<br>
-The X axis represents the bonus obtained from converting your main hand attack from a white attack to a special attack.   A special attack gains the following bonuses:														<br>
1) Cannot be a glancing blow												<br>
2) Base miss rate of ~8.6% rather than ~29% for dual wield<br>
3) Gains +10% increased damage on critical strikes from impale<br>
<br>
-You must calculate the expected damage based on your attack table and weapon damage.  This spreadsheet does not show these calculations.  You should figure them out yourself.<br>

		<div id="post_message_492000">I don't quite get the results of the spreadsheet.  It's not constructed similarly to how I would evaluate the use of one versus the other.<br>
<br>
Here is how I evaluated it:<br>
<br>
[editted out my explanation as it is now redundant.]<br>
<br>
You have a 100 dps, 2.5 speed weapon with 3500 AP.  The boss takes 85% damage (15% mitigated), you hit 85% of the time (miss+dodge = .15) and you crit 35% of the time.  Glancing blows are 24% at 75% damage.<br>
<br>
White Hits:  26% - .85*(3500*2.5/14+2.5*100) = 744 damage<br>
White Glance:  24% - .75*.85*(3500*2.5/14+2.5*100) = 558 damage<br>
White Crit:  35% - 2*.85*(3500*2.5/14+2.5*100) = 1488 damage<br>
White Miss:  15% - 0<br>
Average White:  .26*hit+.24*glance+.35*crit+0=580 damage<br>
<br>
HS Crits:  35% - 2.2*.85*(3500*2.5/14+2.5*100+176)=1965 damage<br>
HS Misses:  5.6% - 0<br>
HS Hits:  59.4% - .85*(3500*2.5/14+2.5*100+176) = 893 damage<br>
Average HS:  .35*crits + .594*hits = 1219 damage<br>
<br>
Damage returned on HS = HS - White = 639 damage<br>
Aggro from HS = damage*.8*.7+196*.8*.7 = 467<br>
Efficiency = Damage returned/Aggro Returned = 1.366<br>
<br>
Cleave Crits:  35% - 2.2*.85*(3500*2.5/14+2.5*100+70)=1767<br>
Cleave Misses:  5.6% - 0<br>
Cleave Hits:  59.4% - .85*(3500*2.5/14+2.5*100+70) = 803<br>
Average Cleave = .35*crits + .594*hits = 1096<br>
<br>
Damage Returned on Cleave = Cleave - White = 516<br>
Aggro from Cleave = damage *.8*.7+130*.8*.7 = 361<br>
Efficiency = Damage returned/Aggro Returned = 1.426<br>
<br>
Same result but easier for my small brain to follow.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">If HS and Cleave had 0 WD and never crit, an average HS/Cleave would be more damage than an average MH swing because of the loss of glance and miss.

</div>I believe the logic behind your results (Calculating expected damage &amp; comparing vs. white is correct.  My spreadsheet is different in that it pulls out the bonus +damage bonus for HS/Cleave so that you can play with the numbers and potentially use it in the future as the abilities change.

</div>I'd say roughly equal, but there's no point in timing Slam when you can just use MS/WW every cooldown for the same result.

				<div style="font-style:italic">Hi everyone. I have a question regarding weapons and armor pene stats. <br>
Im playing in a endgame guild, we farm everything and so on. Im getting next t6 legs to get my 4part t6 dps bonus. <br>
And now what I am asking is this, should I change from Rising Tide MH to the Supremus mace if I get the chance? <br>
Some input here would be nice.<br>
Best regards<br>
Buttlern</div>

</div>No you shouldnt change,since you are an orc you get 3% more hit cause you are using an axe.This is because of our racial 5 axe skill.So rising tide has 3% more hit compared to the mace.Stat wise they are equal and dps wise(around 100dps both).You just gain a little bit from WF and WW cause of its 2.8 speed and high end damage.3% hit tho is way better.</div>

		<div id="post_message_494750">The purpose of stacking cooldowns works something like this:<br>
Start with deathwish and haste pots.  Deathwish buffs your damage per swing for X seconds while the haste pot buffs your swings speed for Y seconds.  Using them separately, you get 20% extra damage for X seconds and something percent more white damage for Y seconds.  When you use them at the same time, you get something percent more swings which also do 20% more damage.  You have gotten off more swings under deathwish and have increased the return of deathwish.  By stacking reckless, deathwish, heroism, and a haste pot all at the same time, you are getting a ridiculous number of swings that are all crits and all do 20% more damage.  Separately, the number of swings affected by deathwish and reckless without haste benefits would be much lower.  Simply, instead of having 50 hits get +20% damage, you can ramp that up to 75 or 100 hits.</div>

</div>With such high latency there are 2 solutions for a dps warrior.Either take a sword up and dont use slam,yes its a bit worse but at least sword spec makes up for it,use hamstring to get some more sword procs when your MS,WW are on Cooldown.<br>

Or just spec dualweild which doesnt require such a good connection and perfect slam rotation .I even abandoned arms cause with my 250-300ms I wasnt satisfied with my slam rotations.</div>

</div>Not much theory crafting needed here: In execute range you will have an instant attack every 1.5 secs (10 instants during recklessness), outside execute range you will have 5 instant attacks (2 WW, 3 BT) during recklessness uptime.<br>
<br>
Pretty much the same is true for all other timers as well.<br>
<br>
More AP during execute range will yield in more rage from white attacks, ergo higher executes. If keeping up rampage is worth the GCD would need some more intensive calculations. Since you will do more damage from white attacks as well I would guess keeping rampage up is worth it.</div>

</div>Assuming without Rampage you're getting enough rage to execute on every global cooldown, would it be worth it to wait for 20 rage and the extra global to refresh rampage? It seems like you would be "throwing out" two executes to refresh Rampage. Battle shout should be an obvious choice to keep up; buffing your entire group with such a large amount of AP more than makes up for a single "lost" execute.</div>

</div>Actually as a fun idea I toyed with the idea of having two 2.7 speed weapons (one mainhand one offhand) and use slam not flurried and instant attack (BT) some time ago. It would make perfect cycles and you would not have he problems of offhand attack being reset badly (it would be restarted as your mainhand weapon). It would also be possible to make very very nice cycles as you wouldnt have haste procs.<br>
<br>
I also id math on the same setup but with flurry.<br>
<br>
I also did some math on the same and using slam and heroic strikes with dualwield (flurried).<br>
<br>
It all turned out crap. Sorry <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080119004925im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":)" class="inlineimg"></div>

<br>
First of all, 1 handers are fast. At least, fast in comparison to any 2handers that are generally associated with slam builds. It has been shown that 2.5 is the fastest possible weapon that you would want to have an optimal slam rotation, but with flurry and haste items, 1-handers will generally be much faster than this.<br>
<br>
Also, what i feel to be the main reason - slam doesn't just reset your main hand swing timer. It resets BOTH your main hand AND your offhand. So really, you're just shooting yourself in the foot if you try to slam while dual wielding. You're much better off just spending the rage on heroic strike.</div>

Your average MH hit for 369 dps is 738.  OH hit for 231 dps is 462.  A good slam lands about .75 seconds after the MH.  So, this costs you .75 seconds of MH dps and on an unmatched setup, an average of 1.75 seconds of oh damage (half an offhand swing and .75 seconds).  That's a white damage cost of 681.  A slam will hit for slightly higher than a MH swing due to less glances, misses, and bigger crits but with no bonus damage.  Say it hits for 1000.  This slam manuever has netted about 320 damage for pulling off a feat of admirable timing while screwing with your specials timers.  Dumping into cleave or HS will have a similar if not greater damage return due to having bonus damage while having less lost dps time.  I'm not going to get into it further.  I'm sure, in an automated sequence, you might be able to gain a smidge of dps with perfect timing but I have never seen anyone pull it off.</div>

</div>I've been using Dragonstrike MH, Talon of Azshara OH for a couple of weeks now.  I personally love the combination.  Previously I had been using a Fool's Bane and Talon, and before that Fool's Bane and Fireguard.  Switching to the Talon in the off-hand felt immensely better.  Trading out Fool's Bane for Drakefist Hammer/Dragonmaw also felt like a large boost.  My rage generation smoothed out considerably between those upgrades as well, allowing for a good deal more Heroic Strikes (I'll give good old Cleave another shot next week, when I can compare it to the prior performance.  I do know I love it when targetting a Spitfire Totem, or when the adds on Solarian first pop.)<br>
<br>
Short version: go for both, they're fantastic together and you won't find better until Hyjal/BT, and even then it may only be the Warglaives that top out.<br>
<br>
(I use subjective terms because unfortunately I had not started logging our raids at this point.  Still, one can tell the difference when going from 4 mobs in a row before bandages while farming to closer to 6 and 7.)</div>

		<div id="post_message_498943">My strategy to dps is to have the rage for BT and WW every time its up while keeping my rage around 25 so that when I switch stances to overpower i dont waste alot of rage.  This works fairly well but I think it could be better.  Sometimes i can screw up and use a HS when i shouldnt and be lacking rage for a BT but bloodrage helps against that.  I also use hamstring when i get over 60 rage because even with HS I cant spend my rage fast enough.<br>
   Can any experts comment on that?<br>
Also, In BT I have a lot of gear choices, tier gier for -armor, crafted haste, ect.  I already feel like im lacking hit due to some unlucky miss streaks(15%) I was thinking of the haste shoulders, akama gloves, and anything else with gem slots of +hit on them while skipping most tier gier due to lack of hit.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">My strategy to dps is to have the rage for BT and WW every time its up while keeping my rage around 25 so that when I switch stances to overpower i dont waste alot of rage.  This works fairly well but I think it could be better.  Sometimes i can screw up and use a HS when i shouldnt and be lacking rage for a BT but bloodrage helps against that.  I also use hamstring when i get over 60 rage because even with HS I cant spend my rage fast enough.<br>
   Can any experts comment on that?<br>
Also, In BT I have a lot of gear choices, tier gier for -armor, crafted haste, ect.  I already feel like im lacking hit due to some unlucky miss streaks(15%) I was thinking of the haste shoulders, akama gloves, and anything else with gem slots of +hit on them while skipping most tier gier due to lack of hit.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</div>Most warriors do not switch stances with the standard 17/44/0 spec because you lose too much rage (yellow damage) going to battle and then back to berserker.  Since hamstring no longer procs windfury I generally only use it between BT/WW cooldowns to proc flurry if it's not already up.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I've been using Dragonstrike MH, Talon of Azshara OH for a couple of weeks now.  I personally love the combination.  Previously I had been using a Fool's Bane and Talon, and before that Fool's Bane and Fireguard.  Switching to the Talon in the off-hand felt immensely better.  Trading out Fool's Bane for Drakefist Hammer/Dragonmaw also felt like a large boost.  My rage generation smoothed out considerably between those upgrades as well, allowing for a good deal more Heroic Strikes (I'll give good old Cleave another shot next week, when I can compare it to the prior performance.  I do know I love it when targetting a Spitfire Totem, or when the adds on Solarian first pop.)<br>
<br>
Short version: go for both, they're fantastic together and you won't find better until Hyjal/BT, and even then it may only be the Warglaives that top out.<br>
<br>
(I use subjective terms because unfortunately I had not started logging our raids at this point.  Still, one can tell the difference when going from 4 mobs in a row before bandages while farming to closer to 6 and 7.)</div>

Hi currently im using the dragonstrike mh and s2 oh sword I have tried the talon in my oh but i found dps to be on par with the 1.5speed oh swords in the long run. And the only thing i dont like about talon in oh is on short dps fights like trash clears if you have a bad run on flurry your dps at 2.7 speed is quite slow.</div>

</div>Exactly.I am worried about this too.Will be one of the biggest fury nerfs ever  making MS/BF way better,at least if you have 1 dps warrior.As it goes for the threat reduction well unless you have really the best of the best item choices except RoS phase 3 and gurtog you shouldnt have any big threat problems with a very good tank.Except if you have a group like ench.Shaman druid BM hunter rogue...<br>
Being stucked with 3 rogues and 1 resto shaman.... I cant see big problems even at teron gorefiend.My best effort there was 1427 dps and still i had space for more.</div>

for me it's kinda fun to try out new specs instead of the good old ones, and i got the 2 swords and gave it a go. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302183726im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":)" class="inlineimg"></div>

Unfortunately cry as we might I doubt they'd move BF over to fury, it would remove all viability for arms in a pve role and Blizz keeps going on about how they want each talent tree to have viability.  That being said this change certainly gives fury a big boost over arms who even after the WF change was still keeping pace in many cases.  I'm curious to see if they add anything to boost arms dps or if this threat change will usher in the end of arms in pve.</div>

		<div id="post_message_502149">Hi, what do you think about Prot warriors in DPS stuff spamming Devastate + Heroic Strike ? They're doing quite good damages if their gear is updated with raid items. Some people raiding BT are saying (on the french WoW boards, sorry I won't translate the whole thread) that Fury warriors aren't worth a place in raid as they're doing less damages than rogues and prot warriors  dps'ing allmost the same as furies (a difference of 100dps, or less, they said). To them, bringing an additional tank with DPS gear is better than having a fury. <br>
As I don't raid in BT/Hyjal, I have no clue about the situation there but in SSC/TK I do really more damages than a Prot warrior in DPS stuff (even Grull or VR fights when we have more than 2 tanks, these fights giving a lot or rage, allowing spamming specials). What do you think about it ?</div>

</div>Presumably they will add a similar talent in Arms (my bet is on Endless Rage) and they appear to be backing off on other DPS classes as well. The Shaman threat reduction talent is getting improved to 30%, and the 2.3 Ret Improved 2H talent is 25% reduction. With the upcoming changes to Devastate, threat generation should be a significantly less stressful task for most tanks.</div>

		<div id="post_message_502570">The problem with Haste is that it's only really slithly better than hit rating for warriors.  They convert at roughly the same rate:  15.8ish rating per point.  In a time period that would net 100 white swings, 1% haste equates to 1 more swing and 1% hit equates to 1 more hit.  This is assuming you are above the yellow miss cap but below the total hit cap.  The benefit of haste then is that you get, on average, more than 1 weapon damage per weapon swing.  With glancing/crits weighted, I get about 1.11 weapon damage per swing.  So, 10 haste is worth about 11 hit rating.  One for one, I'd generally rather have ap/crit as they will enhance my yellow damage as well.  Haste was much more valuable prenerf when a % was cheaper to achieve.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">The problem with Haste is that it's only really slithly better than hit rating for warriors.  They convert at roughly the same rate:  15.8ish rating per point.  In a time period that would net 100 white swings, 1% haste equates to 1 more swing and 1% hit equates to 1 more hit.  This is assuming you are above the yellow miss cap but below the total hit cap.  The benefit of haste then is that you get, on average, more than 1 weapon damage per weapon swing.  With glancing/crits weighted, I get about 1.11 weapon damage per swing.  So, 10 haste is worth about 11 hit rating.  One for one, I'd generally rather have ap/crit as they will enhance my yellow damage as well.  Haste was much more valuable prenerf when a % was cheaper to achieve.</div>

</div>Right, but again it is going to depend on your "chance on hit" itemization.  Haste and hit increase the proc rate of "chance on hit" items.  Crit and AP do not.<br>
<br>
Still, by definition, when you nerf one of the scaling stats, it will make sense to stack the ones that don't scale (AP/STR) to a greater degree.<br>
<br>
This is because it will take a higher static AP to get the same per rating benefit out of post nerf haste.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">With the right gear and group a protection spec'ed warrior in fury gear is quite capable of 1000+ dps.<br>
<br>
I've not had much chance to try it out and never tried it with a enhancement shaman but i did put out 800dps on kaz'rogal a month or so back while getting stunned to death and having my strength reduced by 75%.<br>
<br>
It is however very high threat dps.</div>

</div>This reminded me of a Rage Winterchill kill a couple months ago.  I was protection spec for tanking Illidan flames.  I ended up with 954 DPS from pure HS/Melee/Execute damage.  I didn't  have Devastate which would have helped even more.  Keep in mind I was equipped with respectable DW fury gear at the time.<br>

Protection DPS is certainly possible, albeit high threat as others have mentioned.  With the proper gear you can skip a talent respec once and awhile on farm encounters.</div>

<br>
Has anyone looked at the difference between arms and fury individual DPS and tried to figure out whether the 4% extra physical damage is worth the lower individual DPS?  <br>
<br>
On the debuff side of the equation, I imagine it would have a lot to do with the amount of melee DPS in the raid, but where would the cut off be?  Just to go to an extreme if you had all melee/hunter DPS than surely 4% would be better than any difference in individual DPS.  What if you run with 4 or 5 Melee and say 2 hunters? <br>
<br>
That being said I think the harder side of the equation is getting even a somewhat reliable estimate of the average difference in individual DPS between a Fury warrior and an Arms warrior.<br>

If anyone has any information or thoughts about either the benefit of the raid wide debuff or difference in arms versus fury DPS, I would really appreciate it.</div>

Of course, if you have 2+ dps warriors in the raid you'll probably want the second to be fury, but a single arms warrior is better than a single fury warrior right now, all else being equal.<br>

Also, this is assuming a 25man raid. in 10- or 5-man content fury single target dps is probably the best</div>

</div>You'd really have to look into this sort of thing on an individual basis.  But, say you bring 3 rogues, 2 hunters, enh shaman, feral druid, and 2 prot warriors to a raid along with a fury warrior.  For the sake of simplicity, we'll say all those classes but prot warriors do 1100 DPS, and the tanks do 300DPS.  So 8 physical dps classes plus 2 tanks = 9400 physical DPS.  4% more = 376 DPS.  So if the Arms warrior was able to pull off at least 726 individual DPS the raid DPS would be the same as if the fury warrior was there.  At higher levels of gear it will scale even better.</div>

</div>1. Upload WWS with no Blood Frenzy<br>
2. Add up the total average DPS (not instant DPS!) from all physical sources<br>
3. Multiply by .04<br>
<br>
If you already have a Warrior with BF, multiply the total average DPS by .9615 and subtract that value from the total average DPS.<br>
<br>
This will give you a ballpark of the DPS that BF would provide your raid. Depending on how you stack your raid's DPS, it may or may not be worth it.</div>

that said, the gulf between fury dps and arms dps + BF contribution isn't all that big. Having one warrior spec Blood Frenzy isn't going to revolutionize your DPS or anything</div>

		<div id="post_message_504714">Having read through a great number of informative and educational posts within this thread and others on this site there are a number of points which I have been unable to find answers for.  These are mostly irrelevant for the vast number of your readers who appear to be in high end raid guilds but for the likes of myself who are just starting out on the Raid ladder I would appreciate it greatly if you could give me a little advice on some matters.<br>
<br>
At the moment we are mid way through Karazhan (not much i know but we are putting in a great deal of effort to try and progress) and I am the lone raiding DPS warrior in the guild.  Have spent a while in a half way house Arms spec for PvE and PvP use I decided that I would like to spec DW fury even though it is by far the hardest spec to gear up for early on.<br>
<br>
I would like to know at which stage fury becomes effective?  Reading the WoW forums people suggest aiming for around 15% hit with 27% crit and building up AP and haste rating once these targets have been achieved.  I have reached 14.6% hit and 27.65% crit but I am finding that my DPS is output is substantially lower than I was achieving with my previous arms build (also sustantially lower than indicated by the DPS spreadsheet) despite using the advised "WW, BT weaving" cast rotation.<br>
<br>
Would you delay speccing for DW until a minimum AP cap is achieved or am I missing something important?  On our last Kara run I was averaging around 400dps on bosses when the spreadsheet indicated a maximum of 697.5dps was obtainable.<br>
<br>
Thankyou in advance for your assistance.</div>

		<div id="post_message_504729">The thing about BF, is you make a critical assumption that all of said classes are:<br>
a.) DPSing consistently on the target<br>
b.) Attacking the same single target<br>
c.) Alive to begin with<br>
So when you list all this cumultative dps- you neglect the real world factors which weigh heavily against it. Take for instance Vashj.<br>
For P1, that BF will be optimally affected- but it is hardly needed in P1. Getting Vashj to 70% is an easy task for even guilds who are new to the encounter.<br>
P2 that BF might affect 5 people.<br>
P3 that BF is next to worthless during the 'make it or break it' moments where people are rooted, in/near toxin, running away with charge, or in transit to Vashj.<br>
Solid DPS is needed at the end of fights in order to record a kill. When you are looking down the barrel at half of a raid being dead, you would quickly realize it's not what people bring to the raid for the benefit of others: <i>it is the raw tanking/healing/cc/dps that you bring to the raid that is important</i>, the rest is just icing. (2 arguable exceptions being Trees and Enh Shams)</div>

So when you list all this cumultative dps- you neglect the real world factors which weigh heavily against it. Take for instance Vashj.<br>
For P1, that BF will be optimally affected- but it is hardly needed in P1. Getting Vashj to 70% is an easy task for even guilds who are new to the encounter.<br>
P2 that BF might affect 5 people.<br>
P3 that BF is next to worthless during the 'make it or break it' moments where people are rooted, in/near toxin, running away with charge, or in transit to Vashj.<br>
Solid DPS is needed at the end of fights in order to record a kill. When you are looking down the barrel at half of a raid being dead, you would quickly realize it's not what people bring to the raid for the benefit of others: <i>it is the raw tanking/healing/cc/dps that you bring to the raid that is important</i>, the rest is just icing. (2 arguable exceptions being Trees and Enh Shams)</div>

</div>I ran with the Thundering Skyfire Diamond myself for a while (pre-2.2 mostly). I'll agree that it's a nice meta gem but I think over time Relentless Earthstorm will end up giving a bigger damage increase then Thundering Skyfire. It increases your crit by 0.36% and it increases the damage from crits by 3% (206% for white crits/226% for special crits). <br>
<br>
I'd like to see where you got the 1.6 PPM from on the Thundering Skyfire diamond though, since when I ran with it it didn't proc that much (though it was fun seeing my 2.6 MH drop to ~1.0ish with meta haste trinket and 30% flurry).</div>

</div>I have no idea how much AP is equal to +4 weapon dmg (considering that you'd put it on both your rings.). But I'd suggest plugging it in the dps warrior spreadsheet there should be room at the bottom to plug it in (Page 37 of the dps warrior spreadsheet post #1834 describes how you can add weapon dmg since ring enchants are not available in the sheet at the moment). <br>
<br>
Personally I'd go with +4 to all stats (16 AP and 8 agi giving a nice boost to both your AP and your crit and being affected by kings). <br>
<br>
Apart from white damage only your HS &amp; Whirlwind will be affected by the weapon damage enchant, the +4 to all stats will affect everything.</div>

These are the only 2 occasions I use it though, if you don't have one I guess it's not worth farming AQ40 for it.<br>

</div>Deaths are 1 example listed. The other 2 being either that physical dps is being used elsewhere where the debuff is not active, or that the dps isn't happening altogether.<br>
Hence the 'many failures'  to 'optimal usage' of the debuff. Which brings it back to my statement that raw dps/tanking/healing/cc is what is important, group stacking and raid debuff choice is secondary. Calculating x number of classes doing an avg of y damage each, contributing an optimal value of z additional dps thanks to BF is good, but it neglects any senario save for a simple tank'n'spank.<br>
<br>
In a fight like Patchwerk, or Lurker, yes, I can see bringing an MS-specced BF debuffer. But when you incorporate multiple targets, movement, and/or disabled dps (remote toy, roots, mind control etc), you quickly devalue its worth. Vashj is the example used, as all aspects are present.</div>

</div>I still don't see your point here.... In fact when your BF warrior is rooted he's effectively doing more damage than anyone else who is rooted since BF still affects hunters and any melee who aren't rooted. If you're toyed the same applies, and if you're MCed it still applies.<br>
<br>
Past that I still can't think of any fights where there's any real multiple-target DPS.<br>

Dry streaks on crits, other debuffs knocking Blood Frenzy off the list, whatever the reason, for the most part, you can't assume that Blood Frenzy has a 100% uptime and therefore affects all physical damage for every second of the fight/raid.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">What I gathered from your post is that you don't believe BF is viable because of X number of circumstances that need to be met, I was simply trying to point out that (with the exception of P2 Vashj) it's a moot point.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I still don't see your point here.... In fact when your BF warrior is rooted he's effectively doing more damage than anyone else who is rooted since BF still affects hunters and any melee who aren't rooted. If you're toyed the same applies, and if you're MCed it still applies.<br>
<br>
Past that I still can't think of any fights where there's any real multiple-target DPS.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</div>Almost. From the Vashj encounter I draw my examples, but they can be applied to any fight.<br>
Breaking it down:<br>
Boss is at 100%. Let's say 8 physical dps present, doing a total of 8000dps. In lieu of a fury warrior, the raid brings a BF debuffer. An additional 320dps is provided.<br>
Boss is at 20%. There are only 4 physical dps present (BF is one of them), doing a total of 4000dps. The worth of your debuff is now 160dps.<br>
<br>
As your number of physical dps declines, be it to deaths, being cc'ed, split, or in transit to/from the target with the debuff, so does the overall worth of BF. Crunch time isn't when things are at the start of a fight or when everything is going smooth, crunch time is when you're down to the wire, and you need to do everything you can with what you've got.<br>
<br>
For you to bring a raw dpser, such as fury, in lieu of your BF debuffer, they will need to make up the difference that BF would otherwise generate. We'll say that for an equally geared, equally played, equally group stacked choice, fury will put out 200dps more than your arms guy (this number is arbitrary, but I hope no one tries to argue fury dps &gt; arms dps, especially following the WF totem nerf).<br>
Boss is at 100%. 8 physical dps, doing a total of 8200dps.<br>
Boss is at 20%. 4 physical dps (fury is one of them), doing a total of 4300dps.<br>
<br>
DPS is needed at the end of the fight when things have hit the fan. Consistancy is the main ingredient to success, both the microcasm of this BF debate, as well as the macrocasm of guild leadership. If I was making up a raid, I'm going to bring players and group makeup that yield consistant results.<br>
<br>
The numbers chosen are arbitrary to make the point. I'm saying bringing a BF debuffer is nice, but in the end what is most important is someone in that melee dps slot that is:<br>
1. consistant in their dps contribution (from start to finish of a fight), not the buffs/debuffs they provide<br>
2. significant in what they contribute via dps (an obvious no-brainer)<br>
<br>
Edit: To my knowledge, nowhere did I mention anything about the buff not being active? 'Apply rend in a pinch lol' is cute however.</div>

</div>The thing with this argument is that it's the exact same deal with a feral druid or enh shaman for use in a DPS group. Their DPS on their own is quite lackluster, but their buffs (moreso with the shaman) are what sell them.<br>
<br>
I'm consistently top 5 on meters in my guild, generally only 50-60 DPS behind our fury warrior (depends alot on the fight though). Yes, BF is better with more people alive, at the same time on the note of consistency there are only two fights where "random" deaths should ever be an issue. Gorefiend being a huge one, and having god-awful luck on Vashj being the other.<br>
<br>
The numbers in your examples are a touch off as well, from example 1 to 2 the raid loses 120 DPS :P You need to keep in mind that BF scales very, very well. When we were first going into BT BF was giving us ~200-225 DPS increase as our melee DPS averaged about 1000-1400 per person, currently our lowest melee DPSer (feral druid) is doing about 1200 DPS, me at 1525, fury at ~1600, and rogues varying between 1700-1900 depending on gear, so it is now netting almost 500 DPS.  This is using Gorefiend as an example, as there are really no threat limitations.<br>

Gorefiend loves to kick the shit out of WF totems.  They need to be redropped a lot.<br>

Also one time my DPS was just terrible on him and I could not figure out why at first glance. I went back and looked at the WWS more, and me and one of the Rogues (whose DPS was also way below average) were getting parried like crazy, as if we were attacking from his front, which we definitely were not.  I have seen subsequent parses where he has parried me multiple times as well, its like when he casts shadow of death or incinerate on folks, he is actually turning to face them or something.  I mean I see him do that visually on my client but I figured he was not really supposed to be facing them for melee purposes.</div>

</div>Yes, you bring a valid point. If the person in question is not just dropping totem totems and going balls out, their own dps will be gimped. I'd assume with less micro on his totems and/or other things he might do, he would see a significant boost in his own dps. Again, the dps he brings, just he and he alone brings, is respectable. He chooses to burn GCDs of his own accord.<br>
<br>
I've no objection- but you'll fail to find any solid comparisons in BB. I am rarely pure dps (fury) spec, and even rarer that I'm placed with the enh sham now that an inactive MSer has returned. I'm usually placed in the leftover group as I am brought to OT stuff and dps when not needed to tank (a pity, but there is only so much room for melee dps slots).<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">In a fight like Patchwerk, or Lurker, yes, I can see bringing an MS-specced BF debuffer. But when you incorporate multiple targets, movement, and/or disabled dps (remote toy, roots, mind control etc), you quickly devalue its worth. Vashj is the example used, as all aspects are present.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</div>But Vashj is an exception. The hardest T5 fights (Vashj and Kael) aren't as good for BF, but BF can still contribute a lot to them, and it shines on pretty much every T6 fight, the exceptions being Supremus (immune) and Illidan (Flames are the hardest part of the fight, and they're immune too). Council is a multi target fight, but it's also a fight where any warrior doing decent damage is going to be threat capped, and I don't think the 10% threat change will change that  <br>
<br>
Assuming ~100% warrior uptime (Which is possible in most fights, we have an easier time getting back to a target compared to rogues and enh shamans) the contribution from blood frenzy is around Physical damage x.0385. if you don't have a BF warrior then the contribution would be Physical dps +4%. If you want to figure out if BF is worth it, just apply those numbers to your parses; BF falling off isn't something that happens with any frequency at all, given that deep wounds lasts 12 seconds</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I ran with the Thundering Skyfire Diamond myself for a while (pre-2.2 mostly). I'll agree that it's a nice meta gem but I think over time Relentless Earthstorm will end up giving a bigger damage increase then Thundering Skyfire. It increases your crit by 0.36% and it increases the damage from crits by 3% (206% for white crits/226% for special crits). <br>
<br>
I'd like to see where you got the 1.6 PPM from on the Thundering Skyfire diamond though, since when I ran with it it didn't proc that much (though it was fun seeing my 2.6 MH drop to ~1.0ish with meta haste trinket and 30% flurry).</div>

The average PPM was tested by them to be 1 PPM.  I don't run procwatch or anything like that to test it myself.  The .36% crit and bonus damage on crit is nice, but I still prefer a haste buff. I think RED and TSD might be partially personal preference, but surely at high gear levels (post KZ gear) I'd stay away from the SSD, since it just has nothing about it that scales.  I suppose the run speed might be nice to get out of spore quakes, out of pounding, away from Leo when he is whirlwinding etc, but I'd rather just be able to do more damage and leave my running away to my reaction time.</div>

</div>Agreed, speaking from the perspective I'm assuming Mjollnir has BF will seem a bit lackluster (Vashj, Leo, Hydross, Voidreaver, Kael). I think that's where people are getting a bit hung up. Yes - I agree BF is _not_ the ideal spec for those fights at all, but there is _very_ little like this in Hyjal/BT.<br>

Council is a multi target fight, however (at least the way we do it) all of the melee is attacking Gathios anyway.</div>

		<div id="post_message_508432">I've spent the last week in Hyjal learning bosses that are fairly new to us.  We're on #4 now but have switched over to BT for some early boss work.  In SSC/TK on trash, I rarely get to cleave/ww.  There are CCed mobs all over.  I BT and HS.  I use DW here and there.  I do very well on trash dps.  The only time I would cleave/ww or, post patch, SS, is on packs of un-CCable mobs (SSC pack 1, etc).  On those packs, I'm in tank gear half the time because who carries 5/6 to farm content when bosses don't take that many tanks.  <br>
<br>
In Hijal, it's worse.  Worse being subjective.  I don't mind tanking.  I'm in tank gear for 100% of the trash.  Trash control for AOE dps is vital.  So, the only time I'm in DPS gear is on the boss.  I would never use SS.<br>
<br>
For the bosses, then, they are 3-4 minute DPS zergs.  I use deathwish twice on them meaning deathwish is up more than 25% of the time.  The first time is just death wish.  The second deathwish comes with execute/reckless/heroism.  It would be tough to quantify the numbers but I would guess deathwish provides a ~7% dps increase, nearly twice what you would anticipate.  SS provides a whopping 0% boss dps.  The WW change should take my 5% WW and up it to 8%.  So 7% loss for 3% gain.</div>

<br>
If they are looking to swap a talent for Sweeping Strikes, it should be Enrage.  Enrage is all about PVP and right now it next to useless where its at in Fury.  Its only real effect is to make Flurry a 10 point talent instead of a 5 point talent.</div>

With all these armor reduction gear added in 2.3, i'm wondering how an armor set consisting of full armor reduction gear would do? I'm thinking that most slots will use BT/Hyjal stuff, and the rest will be filled in with ZA/Heroic Badges (there are a lot of items that have AR from the badges that don't drop in the T6 instances).<br>

</div>As far as I know it's sort of a gray area, meaning unknown for certain.  It depends on how much armor bosses have.  The closer you approach bringing a Boss' armor to 0, the better.  However, once you have reached 0 (if that's possible) armor penetration has no effect beyond that.<br>
<br>
edit- more information can be found in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080130060430/http://elitistjerks.com/f31/t16629-raid_boss_armor_values/" target="_blank">this nifty thread</a><br>
After reading it a bit the consensus seems to be that in regards to armor penetration: more is better.</div>

		<div id="post_message_509225">I rate armor penetration as roughly 1% damage increase per 150 armor penetration.  Sometimes it's more, sometimes it's less, but with the numbers I was playing with, it seemed like a fair comparison.<br>
<br>
It seems to me that DW is the skill that everyone wants and SS is the skill that nobody cares about.  Give both trees DW and delete SS from the game.<br>
<br>
The long and short is that improved disciplines, imp MS, and ER are crappy talents.  Stealing from the Fury tree does not make them better talents.  In essence, PVP warriors get more options and Fury warriors get less.  I will accept the DW/SS switch if and only if they swap BF and Imp Slam.  As it were, while carrying 5 points in enrage for no reason, I can't spec a decent fury build for DW with BF and still hold impale.  Are they going to make SS a prereq on BT?  The two skills don't even relate.  I had stated in another thread or earlier in this thread that I would rather not have warriors revamped as everytime Bliz touches your class you have a 50/50 chance of coming out worse.  And here you go.  To be honest, if they axed the DW/SS swap and put some effort into filling out the arms tree with decent deep talents, I'd be happy with the other changes.  The prot changes, threat reduction, and Weapon Mastery/Imp Intercept changes were all between fine and great.</div>

</div>Well I agree with both of you, taking Endless Rage is not a foregone conclusion and perhaps never will be unless they directly improve the talent.<br>

But, why else would they move Deathwish to Arms if not to trry and make ER more appealing?  Are they trying to nerf Fury DPS?  Maybe but then, why give it 10% threat reduction?<br>
<br>
They need to move Enrage into Arms and put Deathwish back where it belongs.  IMO.</div>

</div>This is a truly wonderful change.  It's implications for PvP are enormous.  I was already quite happy with the fact that we're getting 10 swings, but not having to burn rage/GCDs to swap is icing on the cake.  <br>
<br>
What are your plans to cope with the new Disarm change?  With hunters getting a 10 second "Disarm Shot" and the dead zone being eliminated (along with Riposte, Disarm, etc.), it seems like it might be time to dust off the old weapon chain.</div>

Sweeping strikes can go back to arms, make up something stupid and relatively useless for 21 pt fury, doesn't really matter. The point is, DW is too good for any warrior doing DPS to not get. And paladins get AW from the trainer, so it's not without precedent.<br>
<br>
The other thing that needs to happen is that Enrage needs to either be swapped in spots with Dual Wield Spec, or moved to arms. Slam should probably also migrate over to arms, but I'm not sure what you'd swap it with.<br>
<br>
Edit: The more I think about this, the more it makes sense. Similar to how druids were with Innervate, and Mages were with IAE, if you want to do damage as a warrior, pve or pvp or whatever, you NEED Death Wish. It either needs to go to the 11 point spot occupied by PH or by AM, or it needs to be put on the trainer. Putting it on the trainer would have the added benefit of improving prot DPS when not tanking, something that pretty clearly needs to happen anyway.</div>

</div>While this might be true on paper, I remain unconvinced (no pun intended). I'd encourage you to spec with it, then without it. You will see a difference in how choppy rage generation becomes. If indeed it doesn't <i>increase</i> rage generation, it surely does smooth it.</div>

</div>It's also a fear breaker which may be an argument for or against it. If Blizzard changed DW back to be a debuff (instead of a removable buff) taking 5% more damage for 30sec would be the tradeoff that's needed to make sure it's balanced. That actually sounds like a reasonable suggestion when you think about how other must-have skills have been moved to trainers.<br>

</div>Whirlwind right now is only 4% of my dps, and the addition off offhand damage may push it up another 2% at max, because my offhand is fast.<br>

However, with good enough gear (weapons + ap) it may begin to outscale execute like bloodthirst does currently, and will gain priority in execute range when you have enough rage.  Bloodthirst &gt; Whirlwind &gt; Execute &gt; HS.<br>

</div>No, not on most fights.  If you get a good tank who knows proper rotations, tank aggro is going up as well, and currently I'm not threat capped on most fights in the game.  Yes it will be nice on aggro resetting encounters, and fights that have multiple phases so I can start going all out earlier, but you can't make a blanket statement that more threat ceiling = more dps, when there are DPS warriors out there who aren't threat capped at 1900 dps on Teron.<br>

</div>Personally using rough napkin math, and the inability to transfer over, I'm going to say it's a  nerf.  Deathwish scaled with gear, and is better than sweeping strikes in every possible way for boss damage, and could possibly outscale it on add damage in certain conditions.  I will reserve final judgement on whether or not the new weapon expertise will change dps for the better however, as looking over my last WWS, I have 10% damage lost from dodges, and the new weapon expertise could be a large increase in damage, while at the same time smoothing out rage generation.<br>

</div>My initial theory craft is pointing toward 21/40 being superior.  The DPS spreadsheet is showing 60-70 dps from rampage (assumes 100% uptime) and 50-60 dps increase from DW (assumes average usage).  This scales differently depending on gear but Rampage does seem to be 10ish dps more in general.  But as you imply. proper DW usage combined with increased DW uptime/dps because of timing it with other buffs, can increase dps from DW significantly.  In addition, you have at least 37 additional rage per min and at least 1.7 more global cooldowns per minute free (these both assume perfect rampage timing).  At the least, you can get more HSs in (which may make the threat change to imp zerk more important), never have to put off a BT/WW to rebuff Rampage, and use extra GCs for rebuffs and OT duties (BS, DS, TC) or stuff like zerk rage/hamstring.  So there are alot of advantages to 21/40 with the only real drawback being it is more skill based and provides less consistent dps.<br>
<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">My initial theory craft is pointing toward 21/40 being superior.  The DPS spreadsheet is showing 60-70 dps from rampage (assumes 100% uptime) and 50-60 dps increase from DW (assumes average usage).  This scales differently depending on gear but Rampage does seem to be 10ish dps more in general.  But as you imply. proper DW usage combined with increased DW uptime/dps because of timing it with other buffs, can increase dps from DW significantly.  In addition, you have at least 37 additional rage per min and at least 1.7 more global cooldowns per minute free (these both assume perfect rampage timing).  At the least, you can get more HSs in (which may make the threat change to imp zerk more important), never have to put off a BT/WW to rebuff Rampage, and use extra GCs for rebuffs and OT duties (BS, DS, TC) or stuff like zerk rage/hamstring.  So there are alot of advantages to 21/40 with the only real drawback being it is more skill based and provides less consistent dps.<br>
<br>
Also, because 2 hand fury has harder time with the extra GCs and timing needed for rampage, 21/40 would be a clear winner atm IMHO.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</div>Your initial theory craft sounds good initially, but you fail to mention the additional 3 talent points that I have to leave out of the fury tree. This seems to be precision, so you will lose an additional 3% to hit. There is nothing in the arms tree that seems worth buying - it's either imp. charge or stun/charm resist ... <br>
<br>
I will test 21/40 though. Not having to buff rampage sounds tempting <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302210407im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":)" class="inlineimg"></div>

</div>Good point, i was thinking from more of a 2 hand fury perspective since 33/28 and various 2H Fury builds are all i have played as raid dps.  Also, remember you will be getting weapon expertise in Fury but i guess this is really a pvp talent now.   Although you might be able to get more hit from raid gear so perhaps loosing precision is not as bad.  And yeah nothing for those extra 3 points in Arms.  But for 2H Fury you can put them into 2H Weapon Spec.  Combine this with not needing as much hit as DW and i think this will be the prime 2H Fury spec at least.</div>

There's something else - you seem to save rage when you don't buff rampage, yet, those 275 AP will of course convert into rage again, as they increase your white damage (probably worth more rage than what you get from death wish).</div>

		<div id="post_message_510336">An alternative to stopping the swap would be making sweeping strikes useful against single targets as well. Like Blade Flurry has a 20% haste component, they could add something that makes SS worth using over HS. Since they aim to make it dual-wield friendly perhaps reducing or even removing misses for the duration, that would work well and prevent miss streaks when it matters. It should have a noticable effect, be a better rage dump than HS, but not be OP for a 30sec cooldown.<br>
<br>
Of course, that would mean a Fury warrior would have another skill to juggle around... finally incentive to make Rampage passive?</div>

</div>Here is my take on it.  <br>
They are trying to make Fury DPS more consistent and a bit more easier to play.  So they add dps to WW and take out dps from an on use burst ability in DW to counter it.  They give us SS so we have an easier to use aoe like bladeflurry as a situational utility item.  They put Weapon Mastery right above enrage for pvp builds but mostly its the fact that they remove imp intercept from Fury, nerfing pvp as fury because thats the best pvp talent we have.  <br>
<br>
Finally it is now possible to get both Endless Rage and Deathwish, which wasnt possible before.  This should get more ppl to take ER either as 41/20/0 as a new arena spec or as 41/5/15 dps/offtank spec.  And also the moving of deathwish may make 2H fury not as viable in the face of 33/28.</div>

</div>another good point but not sure how much it will counter the rage saved.  And now that i see it that spec would be good for 2H fury but 2H fury get no benefit from the WW buff so it might not be worth 2H fury anymore if we cant use that extra rage effectively like for more slams or such.</div>

</div><br>
It's Blizz's way of breaking the "cookie cutter" builds. 17-41-3 seems like a viable raiding build, getting the 3 for extra threat for off-tanking. Deeper arms seems more viable for pvp/arena warriors with the changes. I still think it should be enrage not deathwish moved to the Arms tree but that would make the trees unbalanced as far as point allocation. <br>
<br>
Sweeping strikes in zerker sounds nice and for farming, it will be. But SS is a very touchy thing to use in raids with all of the CC.  <br>
<br>
And weapon mastery is all right in Fury but why have the disarm proponent to it? I'm on the ptr and testing some builds out but it seems like Blizz had the right idea but was locked in by the ungainly talent blocks in the trees. But if anything, weapon mastery and tactical mastery should change places and remove the expertise from defiance. TM seems has been far less useful for tanks since TC was added to defensive stance.<br>
<br>
I also think the change was in part to lower dps just enough to keep things as they are, balance-wise.</div>

		<div id="post_message_510807">This is just something I've been kicking around, but some Fury changes to go along with 2.3<br>
<br>
These are some ideas for changes in the Warrior Fury talent tree to go along with what is going in Patch 2.3.  This is some theory crafting between two people at 5 AM…So I apologize for any misspellings/anything else that looks odd or wrong or slightly murlocish.<br>
<br>
Your thoughts and ideas would be incredibly welcome, so check this out, read it, mull it over, work with it in your head and find any reasonable improvements or detractions you can make, <b>ANY <u>CONSTRUCTIVE</u> INPUT IS WELCOME</b>.  If you think the Fury talent tree is fine as is or you think it’s over powered or you think these changes aren’t good enough, well…everyone is welcome to an opinion so I won’t complain if you tell me to STFU ZOMGZ.<br>
<br>
(<b>DISCLAIMER</b>:  This post was made on October 14th I will update it if anything changes in the warrior notes or not)<br>
<br>
Here goes, starting from the tree down-<br>
<br>
1.      <b><i><u>Improved Cleave</u></i></b> (<i>3 Talent points, 3rd tier down</i>) Gives a buff, stacks up to four times, that increases the damage of your next whirlwind by <b>10%/20%/30%</b> (<u>according to how many points put into it</u>) So it would be increasing the damage done (<u>if fully stacked on oneself, and again, according to how many points you put in it</u>) by <b>40%/80%/120%</b>.  Make the buff last 15-30 seconds, have it last that full duration so you’re not constantly cleaving; Thus letting you plan your Whirlwind’s and other actions out accordingly (say if the fight is over soon, to refresh your buff or to go for more Whirlwind’s)<br>
<br>
2.	<b><i><u>Separate Enrage from Flurry</u></i></b>(<i>Enrage, 5 Talent points, 4th tier down; Flurry, 5 Talent points, 6th tier down</i>) Make them separate talents and not linked together in any way shape or form.  PvE DPS Fury Warriors have no need for 25% more damage when crit unless they’re tanking the mob and DPSing it as well.  Doing this would enable Fury Warriors who choose not to spend five points in Enrage able to pick up Improved Cleave (<u>See changes above</u>) and get full points in Improved Whirlwind.<br>
<br>
3.	<b><i><u>Flurry</u></i> </b>(<i>5 Talent points, 6th tier down</i>) Change it back to 30% weapon speed increase.  The nerf previously wasn’t that huge of a deal for some people, but if you’re a dedicated Fury DPS warrior, every bit of extra damage counts.  Also, the previous nerf was so small some would argue, it was of no consequence…I agree with the first half of that statement, but I view it as a slap in the face, and I for one Do NOT like being slapped.<br>
<br>
4.	<b><i><u>Bloodthirst</u></i> </b>(<i>1 Talent Point, 7th tier down</i>) A few things were considered with this talent, I can’t decide really between the two listed.  1) Have it give a 10% damage buff for 5-10 seconds (<u>to counter the Deathwish move, it would further improve Fury Warrior DPS issues some talk about</u>) Or 2) Have it heal you for 20-30% of the damage done by your Bloodthirst over a 6 second buff (<u>Would add something survivability for us in PvP, and also in raids that are mob AOE heavy</u>).<br>
<br>
5.	<b><i><u>Rampage </u></i></b>(<i>1 Talent Point, 9th tier</i>) Have the Buff Timer refresh on critical strikes.  This would add something much needed to this talent.  Though some are inclined to disagree with this, look at it this way; You won’t have to spend 20 Precious…Delicious…Rage every 30 seconds for the whole fight (presuming you aren’t unlucky and do not crit once for 30 seconds) So what this little buff would do would effectively give you 250 AP(let’s face it, 275 AP for us fury warriors in 'zerker stance) for the whole fight, and one less timer we have to keep our eyes glued to.<br>
<br>
Ok, that’s pretty much it.  Again, any<u> constructive</u> input and debate is welcome.</div>

These are some ideas for changes in the Warrior Fury talent tree to go along with what is going in Patch 2.3.  This is some theory crafting between two people at 5 AM…So I apologize for any misspellings/anything else that looks odd or wrong or slightly murlocish.<br>
<br>
Your thoughts and ideas would be incredibly welcome, so check this out, read it, mull it over, work with it in your head and find any reasonable improvements or detractions you can make, <b>ANY <u>CONSTRUCTIVE</u> INPUT IS WELCOME</b>.  If you think the Fury talent tree is fine as is or you think it’s over powered or you think these changes aren’t good enough, well…everyone is welcome to an opinion so I won’t complain if you tell me to STFU ZOMGZ.<br>
<br>
(<b>DISCLAIMER</b>:  This post was made on October 14th I will update it if anything changes in the warrior notes or not)<br>
<br>
Here goes, starting from the tree down-<br>
<br>
1.      <b><i><u>Improved Cleave</u></i></b> (<i>3 Talent points, 3rd tier down</i>) Gives a buff, stacks up to four times, that increases the damage of your next whirlwind by <b>10%/20%/30%</b> (<u>according to how many points put into it</u>) So it would be increasing the damage done (<u>if fully stacked on oneself, and again, according to how many points you put in it</u>) by <b>40%/80%/120%</b>.  Make the buff last 15-30 seconds, have it last that full duration so you’re not constantly cleaving; Thus letting you plan your Whirlwind’s and other actions out accordingly (say if the fight is over soon, to refresh your buff or to go for more Whirlwind’s)<br>
<br>
2.	<b><i><u>Separate Enrage from Flurry</u></i></b>(<i>Enrage, 5 Talent points, 4th tier down; Flurry, 5 Talent points, 6th tier down</i>) Make them separate talents and not linked together in any way shape or form.  PvE DPS Fury Warriors have no need for 25% more damage when crit unless they’re tanking the mob and DPSing it as well.  Doing this would enable Fury Warriors who choose not to spend five points in Enrage able to pick up Improved Cleave (<u>See changes above</u>) and get full points in Improved Whirlwind.<br>
<br>
3.	<b><i><u>Flurry</u></i> </b>(<i>5 Talent points, 6th tier down</i>) Change it back to 30% weapon speed increase.  The nerf previously wasn’t that huge of a deal for some people, but if you’re a dedicated Fury DPS warrior, every bit of extra damage counts.  Also, the previous nerf was so small some would argue, it was of no consequence…I agree with the first half of that statement, but I view it as a slap in the face, and I for one Do NOT like being slapped.<br>
<br>
4.	<b><i><u>Bloodthirst</u></i> </b>(<i>1 Talent Point, 7th tier down</i>) A few things were considered with this talent, I can’t decide really between the two listed.  1) Have it give a 10% damage buff for 5-10 seconds (<u>to counter the Deathwish move, it would further improve Fury Warrior DPS issues some talk about</u>) Or 2) Have it heal you for 20-30% of the damage done by your Bloodthirst over a 6 second buff (<u>Would add something survivability for us in PvP, and also in raids that are mob AOE heavy</u>).<br>
<br>
5.	<b><i><u>Rampage </u></i></b>(<i>1 Talent Point, 9th tier</i>) Have the Buff Timer refresh on critical strikes.  This would add something much needed to this talent.  Though some are inclined to disagree with this, look at it this way; You won’t have to spend 20 Precious…Delicious…Rage every 30 seconds for the whole fight (presuming you aren’t unlucky and do not crit once for 30 seconds) So what this little buff would do would effectively give you 250 AP(let’s face it, 275 AP for us fury warriors in 'zerker stance) for the whole fight, and one less timer we have to keep our eyes glued to.<br>
<br>
Ok, that’s pretty much it.  Again, any<u> constructive</u> input and debate is welcome.</div>

		<div id="post_message_510855">Given how powerful Weapon Mastery seems to be (4 points = -4% miss according to Kalgan), I had an unusual thought.<br>
<br>
Defiance is 2 expertise per talent point for a total of 6.  I have read that currently it only works in Defensive Stance.  If this is changed such that it works in all stances, could it become extremely powerful to a Fury spec?<br>
<br>
The current Fury spec is 17/44 - post 2.3 how plausible would something like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302212742/http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=LhZVVzVrxRVuqof0t0h" target="_blank">3/44/14</a> be?  Picking up Tactical Mastery and Defiance.  Is 6 expertise points, ergo, virtually eliminating Dodges and Parries, worth giving up Deep Wounds, Impale and Anger Management?  Neither spec can reach the new placement of Death Wish so that is irrelevant.<br>
<br>
This would of course depend on whether they change the Expertise granted through Defiance to work in stances other than Defensive.  The wording of the talent at present does not tie the Expertise to Defensive Stance.</div>

</div>You need to remember that if bosses tend to dodge 5% or so of your attacks, you won't necessarily be down to 1% after grabbing this talent. The true effectiveness of this talent is determined by:<br>
<br>
(bosses' actual dodge rate - 4%) / (bosses' actual dodge rate)<br>
<br>
And that will be your percentage reduction in dodges.<br>
<br>
Does anyone know how much dodge a boss usually has? The most reliable way to find out would probably be to look at the white damage in a recount window for a main tank on a fight without randomly targeted abilities.</div>

		<div id="post_message_510887">First off let me start out by saying i dont usually post here nor on other forums. Most of whats relevant has already been said and theres frankly no need to repeat what other people have already stated. However, after spending some time reading about peoples opinions on the 2.3 PTR notes and in particular the DW/SS swap i do feel alot of the discussions are missing a bigger picture.<br>
<br>
<br>
Ok, so about the basics. <br>
There's people claiming deathwish is around 3.3% increased damage over time from the simplified model that is 1/6th uptime of 20% damage increase and whirlwind hitting with both weapons alone will outweigh this. Then there's people saying bloodlust/trinkets/executerange boosts deathwish to more then 5-6% easily and whirlwind change wont be able to hold a candle vs it.<br>
<br>
Personally, i dont think whirlwind alone will make up loosing deathwish and frankly i doubt many other experienced fury wars with enhancement shamans in group timing bloodthirsts thinks so either. On the other hand Kalgan recently posted on US forums stating Weapon Mastery will be changed to a flat -4% dodge once moved to fury tree. That and whirlwind change might very well be enough to counteract deathwish, or atleast bring damage close enough to not really matter.. or?<br>
<br>
<br>
Looking at the state of the dps warrior before 2.3, there were 2 distinct types. The 33/28/0 BF-debuffing 2h warrior and then the 17/44/0 dw fury warrior. Depending on raid composition &amp; boss mob at times the first was better then the second and otherway around but for the record, I do think lately the scales been tipping in favor of the 2h warrior if you wanted to theorycraft about it. Mainly due to rogue scaling and hunter 4p T6 being very good.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
However, going back to 2.3 PTR and looking at other changes its pretty clear that:<br>
<br>
1) Moving DW and imp intercept absolutely cements the arms warrior as the pvp choice. Not saying it wasnt the case before but now its just undebatable fact.<br>
<br>
2) Since its my opinion that whirlwind buf alone wont outweigh loosing deathwish, and the BF-debuf dps warrior will still get the -4% dodge i feel 33/28/0 will get closer to 17/44/0 when it comes to personal dps after 2.3 in its current state. Considering what forum this is I should'nt have to tell you competative raiding includes 1 dps warrior.<br>
<br>
3) Blizzard acknowledges tank's are short supply in a more general sense, being able to pickup TM for the increased threat in defensive stance might be desirable for alot of dps warriors that's not on the bleeding edge of content (and arguably desirable for the realm population aswell). Even before 2.3 the fury tree was pretty bloated, mainly due to enrage being linked to flurry, and with Weapon Mastery becoming a must have talent its only getting worse.<br>
<br>
<br>
So, what do you get when you combine those 3?<br>
Maybe im overly pessimistic, but to me it seems like the arms/2h warrior might very well trumph the fury warrior in all 3 of "casual" endgame, bleeding edge raiding and arenas.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Naturally there's all kinds of things that could be done to tip the scale in another direction and while the previous paragraph is the important one i'll include some for completeness.<br>
<br>
a) You could, ofc, not swap them leaving the relative dps between dw and 2h decently intact which probably is ok until next expansion of talent trees anyway. Suppose this could cause issues with WotlK talent trees or with trying to make more warriors spec 41p into arms but frankly thats not my problem.<br>
<br>
b) Move BF to 2nd tier in arms or some similar accessable spot from fury pov, cementing the fury warrior as the pve endgame dps choice. Not something arms warriors would appreciate i suppose, then again its pretty easy to make an argument why it'd be more balanced.<br>
<br>
c) If neither a) or b) happends, i do feel dw fury will need a single target dps buf in one way or the other to counteract the BF-debuf spec. Could be done in many ways, tho naturally giving SS some form of single target effect similar to rogue's blade flurry has been suggested.<br>
<br>
.. and ye, do something about enrage being linked to flurry.</div>

</div>Expertise is -0.25% dodge/parry per point, so WM only gives -2% dodge. It doesn't actually affect your miss rate.<br>
<br>
Or, if you mean skill rather than expertise, 4 points is 1.6% hit.<br>

Considering the cost of execute increases from 10 to 15 rage with out the 2/2 talent, so 5 rage more per execute spam, but you gain -4dodge passive. You can only use execute on the last 20% health on the target but the -4dodge will be utilised 100% of the time on the target. My question is will it increase our dps overall to use weapon mastery 2/2 over improved execute 2/2.</div>

Thats what it says on the PTR at present however it has not been updated yet it should be soon. A Blue has confirmed on the US wow forums 100% that 2/2 weapon mastery will reduce the chance to dodge attacks by a flat -4%<br>

</div>This is wrong. 1 point of expertise converts to -0.25% dodge/parry. Thus, 2/2 weapon mastery will result in -1% dodge/parry.<br>
<br>
This is still great, since your yellow damage will improve.<br>
5% dodge = 1 out of 20 yellow attacks will be dodged.<br>
4% dodge = 1 out of 25 yellow attacks will be dodged.<br>

Getting 20 points in expertise will result in a 5% increase in yellow hits (not crits).</div>

		<div id="post_message_511440">I just compared whirlwind live/ptr.<br>
<br>
I used BS as the only buff and the same gear. Mobs were Apexis Flayers in Blade's Edge.<br>
OH-Weapon: Rising Tide<br>
<br>
LIVE:<br>
Average hit: 400, Average crit: 850<br>
<br>
PTR:<br>
Average hit: 680, Average crit: 1500<br>
<br>
Depending on your crit chance, this will give you appr. 430 more damage per whirlwind (40% crit assumed). <br>
<br>
If we assume optimal whirlwind usage and 1/2 imp. whirlwind, you will get an increase of 430/9 dps = <b>+48 DPS</b> or (2/2 imp. ww) 430/8 = <b>+54 DPS</b>.<br>
<br>
How does that compare to the loss of DW?<br>
DW (assuming you use it whenever it's ready, ignoring optimized usage with heroism or in execute range) will be up 1/6 of the time, thus increasing your dps by 3,33%.<br>
<br>
1000 DPS ---&gt; + 33 DPS<br>
1500 DPS ---&gt; + 50 DPS<br>
<br>
So, according to my initial tests, you need 1500 DPS in every Deathwish phase to achieve a dps boost similar to the new whirlwind. Apparently, the change wasn't too bad, especially if you consider the following aspects:<br>
<br>
Whirlwind has too yellow attacks --&gt; more flurry uptime + improved proc chance<br>
Whirlwind as yellow damage profits immensely from expertise<br>
As soon as there is more than one mob to fight, the combination of ss + ww is extremely powerful<br>
<br>
Even though I was very squeamish about loosing DW at first, it seems to be a buff in the end. Combined with the -10% threat it definitely is.</div>

		<div id="post_message_511443">So I finally got on the PTR.<br>
<br>
On the Whirlwind change: It seems that the attack hits with both weapons, separately, I just assumed it could combine the weapon damage of both of your weapons into 1 WW attack, like Rogue Mutilate, but in the combat log it registers an attack for each weapon, which is nice.<br>
<br>
On the Mace Spec change: It's a pure PvP spec, but the nerf didn't seem very huge, from the phasing people have done it's -1% proc rate with slow weapons (3.5-3.8 Speed) and with the additional rage on the proc it kinda makes up for it.<br>
<br>
On the Death Wish change: I miss it, did a little Zul'Aman testing, was saddened to see there was no Death Wish to pop, only Sweeping Strikes, which was kinda worthless because of the nature of Zul'Aman being a boss run instance. =/<br>
<br>
On the Imp Zerker Stance change: had a Paladin salv me, so on top of that there was no way I could pull aggro, and I was going all out....all out as you can go without Death Wish. &gt;_&gt; Including Haste Pots, and Reckless Executes.<br>
<br>
Overall I feel like my DPS has been nerfed, hoping the -4% dodge change will boast it, but right now I'm seriously considering a 33/28 build if it goes live as is, fairly sure 4% physical damage boast, in addition to everything the spec provides is better then this at the moment.</div>

</div>You need to take the extra rage generated by DW into account to get the correct damage boost. Using the dps spreadsheet i lose about 5% dps when I remove Deathwish from my talents. Updating the spreadsheet to add the OH damage to WW (not sure exactly how it will work, I just add the average OH hit to the WW damage) I get a total dps decrease of 2.8%.<br>
Weapon expertise talent might make this go away, but I can't really find any talent points to put in it. The whirlwind calculation was done with a dagger as OH, with a slow OH the damage will be bigger (*sadface, I like my fast weapons, why force us even more into using slow...).<br>
<br>
I'm not too worried about the changes, the whirlwind change might very well make up for losing DW. You will not be able to pop DW (due to missing rage, wanting to "save" DW for later or just being unfocused) at every single cd, making the buff worse.<br>
<br>
edit: I'm fully buffed in the spreadsheet with about 2.7k AP, 35% crit and 16% hit (no haste, no -AP).</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I just compared whirlwind live/ptr.<br>
<br>
I used BS as the only buff and the same gear. Mobs were Apexis Flayers in Blade's Edge.<br>
OH-Weapon: Rising Tide<br>
<br>
LIVE:<br>
Average hit: 400, Average crit: 850<br>
<br>
PTR:<br>
Average hit: 680, Average crit: 1500<br>
<br>
Depending on your crit chance, this will give you appr. 430 more damage per whirlwind (40% crit assumed). <br>
<br>
If we assume optimal whirlwind usage and 1/2 imp. whirlwind, you will get an increase of 430/9 dps = <b>+48 DPS</b> or (2/2 imp. ww) 430/8 = <b>+54 DPS</b>.<br>
<br>
How does that compare to the loss of DW?<br>
DW (assuming you use it whenever it's ready, ignoring optimized usage with heroism or in execute range) will be up 1/6 of the time, thus increasing your dps by 3,33%.<br>
<br>
1000 DPS ---&gt; + 33 DPS<br>
1500 DPS ---&gt; + 50 DPS<br>
<br>
So, according to my initial tests, you need 1500 DPS in every Deathwish phase to achieve a dps boost similar to the new whirlwind. Apparently, the change wasn't too bad, especially if you consider the following aspects:<br>
<br>
Whirlwind has too yellow attacks --&gt; more flurry uptime + improved proc chance<br>
Whirlwind as yellow damage profits immensely from expertise<br>
As soon as there is more than one mob to fight, the combination of ss + ww is extremely powerful<br>
<br>
Even though I was very squeamish about loosing DW at first, it seems to be a buff in the end. Combined with the -10% threat it definitely is.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</div>*sigh* The one thing you neglect, as many people do, is the portion of the fight that you aren't hitting anything. Steady DPS is important, but optimized DPS, when you are able to DPS, is more important still.<br>
As you yourself have stated, ignoring optimized DW usage, the results yield such-and-such. But from a real world perspective, who <i>doesn't</i> optimize DW usage? I have a macro that pops troll zerk, DW, BL brooch, and haste pot simultaneously (this is usually timed about when the enh sham burns his Drums as well, but <i>always</i> timed so I get the full duration's benefit.). And then obviously I've got Recklessness to add to the mix for the 20% burn. I'd assume any fury warrior worth their salt has a similar or superior DW macro/usage. With the exception of the brooch, I can still pop all the same goodies and none benefits WW not in the slightest (Recklessness would make 2? WW's guaranteed crits).<br>
The numbers I'm plugging into the spreadsheet coupled with the new changes yield very similar results as what I'm seeing now. When/if the SS/DW change goes live, it might very well be a L2P situation where styles must adjust to incorporate the changes, but I remain skeptical on the trade off we've received. It's like you've taken away the teddy bear I've gone to sleep with since birth, handed me a rag doll, and are trying to convince me that the rag doll is just as good.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">You need to take the extra rage generated by DW into account to get the correct damage boost. Using the dps spreadsheet i lose about 5% dps when I remove Deathwish from my talents. Updating the spreadsheet to add the OH damage to WW (not sure exactly how it will work, I just add the average OH hit to the WW damage) I get a total dps decrease of 2.8%.<br>
Weapon expertise talent might make this go away, but I can't really find any talent points to put in it. The whirlwind calculation was done with a dagger as OH, with a slow OH the damage will be bigger (*sadface, I like my fast weapons, why force us even more into using slow...).<br>
<br>
I'm not too worried about the changes, the whirlwind change might very well make up for losing DW. You will not be able to pop DW (due to missing rage, wanting to "save" DW for later or just being unfocused) at every single cd, making the buff worse.</div>

</div>Yeah totally correct. Offhand daggers will not be good at all after 2.3.<br>
<br>
Btw, the calculations I made of WW damage was completely wrong (didn't include normalized AP damage from OH). With a 1.8 sec dagger you will lose less than 1% dps with the DW+WW change combined (assuming DW to be up 1/6 of the time but without any stacking of effects). Changing my Emerald ripper OH to Spiteblade (2.7 sec) results in a net dps increase.<br>
<br>
It's almost impossible to model Deathwish as anything else than "up for 1/6 of the time". It may be possible that modeling it in this way gives less damage than reality due to the stacking effect of different buffs, but there is no way to know short of checking combat logs. However, if you wait to trigger DW until you have other buffs ready you're also losing dps due to not using it 1/6 of the time.</div>

		<div id="post_message_511748">What are you on about? "Bot style play"? Really don't understand what point you're trying to make here.  <br>
<br>
I'm only talking about how to model Deathwish. People are claiming anything between 1 to 20 % dps increase from Deathwish alone, there is no way to know until someone has actually checked the logs (good if you do that, would be interested in the results). <br>
<br>
The way most people are modeling Deathwish is to assume that the talent point gives you a 20% damage increase 1/6th of the time, i.e. a 3.33% damage increase (in spreadsheets one can also include the effect of extra rage income -&gt; more heroic strikes, which can yield a total dps increase of about 5% for Deathwish, depending on gear setup). What I meant was just that if you compare a standard model of Deathwish being up 1/6th of the time to a "model" where it's triggered at the same time as other buffs, you cannot assume that it's up the same amount of time. <br>
<br>
I know that the effect of Deathwish will be a lot greater when you have other buffs active, but I'm not certain that it's worth "saving" Deathwish to these occasions. If you can time all the effects to be active at the same time without losing any waiting time you should of course do so. In some cases it's obviously easy to do it (e.g. &lt;20% DW+Recklessness) and of course I do that.</div>

</div>I mean there are a lot of fights in the game that don't last more then 6 minutes, which only allows for 2 death wishes. On a fight like Solarian for instance, obviously if I pop death wish in the first 15 seconds of the fight in combination with heroism, I'm only going to have it up again to use for the last 20% of the fight, seeing the cool down up @ 43% and using it means I definitely won't have it for execute range.<br>
<br>
It's those 7 minute+ fights that are tricky, because you kick yourself for not having DW up that 3rd time, or waiting because you overestimated your normal raid DPS. It just takes experience and a good understanding of the encounter, and your raid's normal DPS to maximize DW's potential.</div>

		<div id="post_message_512129">I'm opposed to the DW/SS swap.  It doesn't make much sense to me.  If you were to rate which spec does it's job the best I would rank warrior specs the following:<br>
<br>
1. Arms For PVP.  Arms warriors are the most centrally important to PVP.  It's not even close.<br>
2. Prot Warriors for Tanking.  Prot warriors have fair competition for tanking these days but they bring certain unique abilities that make them prefered or required for certain encounters.<br>
3. Fury warriors for PVE DPS.  Fury warriors fair well but other than having a part time tank, fury warriors can be replaced with prot warriors BSing the rogues or another rogue.  Our strength comes from offtanking trash well when needed (which rogues can't do) and DPSing well (which prot warriors don't do too well).  <br>
<br>
If you take from the Fury warriors and give to the Arms warriors, it makes no sense.  PVP warriors have more skill points to play with so they are buffed for PVP further.  Fury warriors are more or less stuck.  They can go 2hand for DPS or see what they can squeeze out of the Fury tree knowing that they would likely serve the raid better with BF.<br>
<br>
Currently the 17/44 build has no spare points.  Any new skill in Fury requires losing another DPS skill.  If the Fury tree picks up more skills but doesn't optimize any, you get to the point of dropping 14 points out of Arms to pick up 2-3 more points in Fury.  Now you have 10 filler skill points.<br>
<br>
Here is most of a post I wrote about the value of DW for raid DPS:<br>
<br>
The correct use of cooldowns in the game is not simply to click it every time it's up and continue as usual. Lets say you have 1000 dps which follows roughly a 600 white/400 yellow split. WW is at best 5% of your total damage (50 dps). <br>
<br>
Let's say you are fighting any of the first 3 Hyjal bosses. These are essentially the pinnacle of DW usage. They are fights that last about 3-4 minutes and allow for 2 uses of deathwish. <br>
10-15 seconds into the fight with the tanking having gained aggro with their abilities, some hunter MD help, and some PoMs, you pop DW number one. During DW, you pop a haste pot. That's 25% increased attack speed. Now, most of the time, you have flurry up which is a base 25% haste. 25% more haste is in fact only an increase of 20% in number of attacks expected. Over the course of the fight you average 600 white dps. 20% more than this is 120 dps. However, the DW allows more offhand damage and increases HS spam which increases your dps further. I'm not going to quantify this. Instead, I am going to use the 25% (150dps) increase for the haste pot during it's 15 seconds. So now you have 750 base DPS for 15 seconds and 600 base dps for 15 seconds. That's 675 average DPS for 30 seconds. Apply DW and that's 810 DPS for 30 seconds. Egad, that's a 35% increase in DPS by stacking 2 buffs. Haste pot alone is only a 25% increase for half the time (12.5% averaged over 30 seconds). Deathwish has amplified the haste post so that 12.5+20 becomes 35! Not to mention, your yellow dps has gone from 400 to 480 dps. 1290 dps out of a 1000 dps player for 30 seconds. How is this black magic possible? Just thank Levitra I guess. If you don't understand that bit, don't both reading further. <br>
<br>
That's just the first deathwish. We'll call that baby deathwish. Now comes the 19% real deathwish. Haste pot, bloodlust/heroism, reckless, deathwish. Grand daddy deathwish. This is Rambo with his M16 mowing people down in front of the helicopter. This is fun stuff. Now, you have 600 white DPS hasted by 30% for 30 seconds, 25% more for 15 seconds, everything crits for 15 seconds, and you have deathwish. 600 white dps becomes 780/930 (no haste pot, haste pot). During the haste pot, reckless takes you from 930 dps: <br>
Say you hit 85% of that time with 24% glancings (.75 damage) and 35% crits (doubles) for expected weapon damage of 1.14 x base. Under reckless, all these go to 1.4 x base (your still miss and glance). That's a ratio of 1.4/1.14 = 1.228 or 930 dps x 1.228 = 1142. <br>
Heck, lets toss deathwish on there: 1370 white DPS. So, 1370 white DPS for 15 seconds with deathwish (1142 without) with 936 unrecklessed/780 without deathwish the other 15 seconds. <br>
Lets say you normally do 1000 yellow execute spam DPS. (say 2200 under reckless). So you add deathwish to the mix and you get 20% more rage for harder executes which hit 20% harder again. You get deathwish stacking on deathwish. The return on execute is not linear damage/rage but I'll assume it is for comparison. For 15 seconds, you have 936 DW DPS versus 780 without for a rage factor of 1.2. Execute spam goes from 1000 to 1200 because of extra rage. No add DW and execute goes to 1440. This is a high number but during execute spam do not think that DW adds less than 30% damage. During the second half, your 2200 goes to 3168. Total DPS without DW: 2561, with 3379 with. <br>
<br>
So now you have 210 seconds of a boss fight where for 138 seconds you do 1000 dps. For 30 seconds you could have deathwish. For 42 seconds, you execute and for 30 of those seconds you could have deathwish. <br>
Without deathwish: 264030 damage <br>
With deathwish: 297270 damage <br>
<br>
So in a fight like this Deathwish provides 10% + damage. <br>
<br>
I'm not going to say my math is great. I wrote this as quickly as possible and did not pile up as many trinkets/procs as possible. You can make a case for it being closer or farther apart. Under no circumstance is 3% an appropriate approximation of deathwish increasing DPS. And if you think 1 offhand hit every 9 seconds is going to do 30k damage in a 3.5 minute fight, well I don't know what to tell you.</div>

</div>I don't believe that even makes sense.  So if you believe if you sit and autoattack you will proc something once per minute and if you go all out with specials you will still be proccing once per minute?  Does that mean there is a 60s timer between procs so you never get 2 procs in a minute and double procs are impossible?<br>
<br>
No, that does seem incorrect then.  From what I gather, procs are coded so that under autoattack they average X procs per minute.  This is based on weapon speed.  A 3 second weapon swings 20 times in a minute so a 1 ppm enchant converts to a 5% chance on hit.  A 2 ppm would be 10%.  A 1ppm on a 6 second weapon would be 10%.  This mates up with getting double procs yet not devaluing an enchant on a slow weapon by having straight %based procs.  This conversion, however, allows for additional moves above and beyond your autoattack to generate more procs.  If you go out and test this, you will find that cycling instants has a fairly clear effect on the actual amount of procs you get.  Some enchants wind up with hidden cooldowns to control the rate at which the PPM can be raised with faster casts.  If it was controlled in the way in which you suggest, spell surge would not need a hidden cooldown on it.</div>

</div><br>
Is it really making it that attractive to anyone? What has changed with Imp MS and ER that I have missed? What new benefits has it picked up? If they wanted to accomplish that, they would have fixed 33+ in the Arms tree. If anything they are not trying to fix a problem, they are just trying to force you out of the best PvP cookie cutter. So in essence they are eliminating what they consider a problem with the class by introducing a few more. I've never understood the backwards logic they have with fixing our class. <br>
<br>
And as you said, the real reason warriors go mid fury for PvP is Enrage. Deathwish is good in PvP but I could live without that but not Enrage. In PvE it would be just the opposite.<br>
<br>
This change is by far the most odd I've seen from Bliz since my first patch of 1.2. We've asked for Enrage to be moved to Arms for the last few years and never once did anyone ask for a change to SS or DW.<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304035456im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/confused.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":confused:" class="inlineimg"></div>

		<div id="post_message_512649">A lot of people are also treating fights as a static thing. How many fights have built in design to be burst oriented? How many fights these days do you really hit the mob for an unchanging amount (no modifiers) from 100% down to 0% with nothing interrupting you? <br>
<br>
We are moving further and further away from pure tank and spank, you don't have 100% dps time for an equivelent amount. Forget DPS alone, look at the nerf from the perspective of beating encounters also. How important do you find Deathwish to be when AoEing Kael weapons, executing trapped Illidan, burning down the last percentages of a boss with a health point enrage, or when you FINALLY get go all out on Bloodboil for those precious 30 seconds. Let alone the fights with DPS dead time because it's either kited or is immune or we're in a "cutscene'/transition" and what have you.<br>
 <br>
Encounters have a lot of 'dead' time that make DW more valuable than what  modeling it would show you (stacking it with other cooldowns aside - and yes stacking is indeed obvious),  a limited time increase coupled with another limited time increases, the few that say "it'd be the same if you use deathwish at 30% or use it at 19% with heroism/reck/haste pot" are completely out of it.<br>
<br>
These are things a lot of posts don't take into account - burst damage like Deathwish being on demand while taking more damage is in large part of what Fury is about, same line of Recklessness.<br>
<br>
On the net, we probably didn't lose over much or gain over much for most encounters when all the changes are tallied (if you were really threat capped, you gained, without a doubt), but this change really irks me for reasons beyond statistics. All for a talent that has been rehashed over and over, and most people still won't take. The sinister side of me just leads me to think they should transfer all the popular talents, protection included over to arms. If you have nothing else to take you may indeed take a talent you don't really need - that seems to be the logic here for a 41 point deep talent.</div>

<br>
What you mostly gain by not taking Impale is rather the points you free out of the arms tree for other things, for example TM you could say. Otherwise just take the points out of precisions, well geared fury has sickly high hit anyway and it is a cheap stat in the item budget. Impale is near a 4% DPS increase off the top of my head for the typical fury warrior.</div>

</div>I agree.  Simply unlinking it, period, is a win/win.  But do you really think that their motivation is to make ER/IMP MS more attractive in a PVE setting?  The role delineation between the trees seems pretty strong already...  So if the move is anticipating 51 arms talents, so be it.   But if the pve dps tree is suffering from a back-asswards middle section because they don't want warriors using flurry in pvp, they need to change the talent associations.</div>

		<div id="post_message_512963">Meh, I don't buy that reason, if they are going to use that as reason for Arms warriors to get DW then I propose they unlink Enrage -&gt; Flurry so we have 5 more points to flesh out the rest of the Fury tree with "must have" talents.<br>
<br>
Much like my Arms brothers I feel forced into getting certain talents therefore I'm left with few options as to how to pick up Imp. Cleave or Weapon Expertise to go with my new Sweeping Strikes forced talent without ruining my cookie cutter build. :P<br>
<br>
I'm just going to shoot from the hip here, but there are a lot of good ideas they could do with the Fury tree to free up points while keeping the tree as it is such as making Enrage a 1 point talent and tying the gains the other 4 points give into Flurry so they actually make sense together.  This would free up 4 points that would still force us to make a style decision but at least we'd have options at this point.<br>
<br>
They could move this new Enrage -&gt; Flurry over to above Sweeping Strikes and make it part of the chain down to Bloodthirst and Rampage.   Make Sweeping Strike a passive that has a chance on hit to hit an adjacent target.<br>
<br>
Modify Bloodthirst to take away 30 health per successful swing making Rampage a passive that as the health lowers on a Fury warrior they gain an AP boost.  <br>
<br>
Again this is just shooting from the hip with a random quick thought, but it keeps the tree intact.  It doesn't greatly modify the talents in such a way to make them any more powerful then they are now, but keeps the concept of a Fury warrior alive and well and there is some sort of logic to follow when looking at the tree.</div>

</div>Right, as I said I'm just shooting from the hip.  My previous post is just random thoughts that would keep the Fury tree very similar but also add some new twist to it and a gameplay style that would reap benefits for those who knew how best to balance it.  <br>
<br>
Perhaps that wasn't the best shot but it goes towards my point of there are lots of little things Blizzard could do to modify the talents/trees to better fit a theme that talent trees have, then these seemingly random changes they are making now with poor reasoning behind the change.  <br>
<br>
That isn't to say that these are completely bad changes, but the statement that some warriors felt pigeon holed into getting certain talents leaving them with little choice is a rather weak statement, thats true of any class that is trying to maximize their specific function.<br>
<br>
As it stands now with these swaps, Fury is left up shit creek because now we're the ones with limited choices as there are several talents in the fury tree that are accepted as "must haves" and we really don't have the points to spend to take advantage of these new talents, at least in the case of following cookie cutter builds.<br>
<br>
It remains to be seen if these changes truly will make the difference that Blizzard seems to think they will.</div>

Well, as things are (right) now. It seems like they (Blizzard) are.. hm, in lack of a better word, "experimenting" with the warrior talent tree. <br>
<br>
I'm guessing (hoping?) that they'll do some other adjustments (based on what people have been suggesting) quite soon.<br>
<br>
My assumption is also based on the quote from Bornakk (I think) mentioning they will do some other adjustments to certain classes. He also mentioned the mortal strike effect for hunters, as an example.</div>

</div>That's nice, it'll save me fighting with our rogues for the bloodsea brigand's chest anyway.<br>
<br>
Edit: Rather than making a second post I'll just comment on the above two here:<br>
Exactly. I raid as 33/28 and I'll still have the same talents in 2.3 and I can't see me changing unless BF moves to fury or something amazing is added to upper arms tiers.<br>
<br>
Even if they do buff arms I suspect it would be a pvp buff rather than pve, although I could be wrong given arms still keeps BF. Perhaps now DW is in arms they could swap endless rage with something like "Unstopable deathwish: While deathwish is active you are immune to all CC/slowing effects"</div>

</div>Yes, but in the past, the PvP gear and DPS gear both had crit rating and hit rating and str, and now the DPS set has agi instead of crit, and barely any hit. It just isn't itemized as well, so even though the S3 gear is itemized for "PvP" it has comparable (if not better) actual DPS stats.</div>

The thing that frustrates me is that after three years we are still fighting to have a decent fury set that is all Plate. Nearly every release of new gear sees gaping holes in itemization and often has us stealing gear from rogues or hunters. There doesn't seem to be an avenue to even get that frustration out. During TBC beta I submitted dozens of tickets due to the lack of dps plate upgrades along with stats in the wrong area (too much stam, use of agil instead of crit, etc). At the end of the day they just need to balance out crit, strength, hit and enough stam to keep us alive; then toss in some nice flavor stats here and there (-armor, haste, +bonus damage to xxx).</div>

</div>They could make the vast majority of the burning community hate go away by doing two things.<br>
<br>
1. Unlinking Enrage from Flurry, thus saving Fury warriors having to stick 5 points into a talent that does not help us in any meaningful way.<br>
<br>
2. Swapping Improved Slam with Blood Frenzy. BF seems to fit the fury tree better thematically anyway, and it cements Fury as <i>the</i> PvE dps spec. <br>
<br>
One effect of these changes that hasn't been much discussed is that the swap of DW and Improved Intercept means that nearly all the powerhouse PvP talents are now in Arms. So put the PvE raid damage buff talent in Fury. Blizzard should finish specializing our trees, and stop pretending that Fury being PvP viable is a goal of theirs. If I wanna arena, I'll just respec. It's not like I'm not swimming in gold.</div>

</div>1) I dont think they are going to do this.  Its a simple change but they havent done it yet, so I dont think they will.<br>
<br>
2) The T6 set bonuses suck too.  Compare ours to the Rogue T6...night and day.<br>
<br>
3) The very first thing they need to do is unlink Enrage from Flurry.  Enrage is a black hole for talent points and does nothing for PVE Fury except double the cost of Flurry.  We can not even take advantage of the 'awesome' changes we got because they took away 1 talent point in Deathwish and added 4 more in Weapon Mastery and Imp WW (I know its not a new talent, but the base ability is much better making 2/2 compelling for the first time).  Fun fact: 2/2 Weapon Mastery and 2/2 Imp WW probably do not add up to the DPS you lose from intelligent Deathwish usage.<br>
<br>
4) See above.<br>
<br>
5) Agree here, sort of.  Every tree has some 'dead' talents.  They really only need to get rid of the ones that know clear thinking person would ever take.  Like Improved Rend, etc.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">They could make the vast majority of the burning community hate go away by doing two things.<br>
<br>
1. Unlinking Enrage from Flurry, thus saving Fury warriors having to stick 5 points into a talent that does not help us in any meaningful way.<br>
<br>
2. Swapping Improved Slam with Blood Frenzy. BF seems to fit the fury tree better thematically anyway, and it cements Fury as <i>the</i> PvE dps spec. <br>
<br>
One effect of these changes that hasn't been much discussed is that the swap of DW and Improved Intercept means that nearly all the powerhouse PvP talents are now in Arms. So put the PvE raid damage buff talent in Fury. Blizzard should finish specializing our trees, and stop pretending that Fury being PvP viable is a goal of theirs. If I wanna arena, I'll just respec. It's not like I'm not swimming in gold.</div>

	</table>
</div>I am now of the opinion that they simply MUST do #1 above.  I am going to make it my mission in WOW to get that change pushed through.  There is no reason why our subpar Flurry should cost 10 talent points.<br>
<br>
#2 would be AWESOME.  I am hesitant to push for that though as it pretty much would negate the only reason to bring an Arms Warrior to a raid though.</div>

</div>As it stands now, you're about to be out of a job as fury, and are looking for a reason <i>to</i> attend a raid when you have an arms warrior you can take instead.<br>
BB ran Vashj last night, on our kill attempt I had semi-optimal DW usage, having the group LW time his drums during the first DW, and drums catching the tail part of the execute spam DW (they were still on CD). I plan to parse this data to find out a more concrete, real world value of DW.</div>

</div>I don't think Blizzard would ever do this, simply because it involves a talent from another tree. Suppose someone wanted to be Fury/Prot? They would need to DPS in battle stance to keep Rend up for BF. As it is, Fury/Prot is gimped, but with the change to Defiance and TM, it seems the powers that be envision Warriors with at least a few points in Prot, regardless of their main tree.<br>

I'm trying to think of other classes which have talents that require a talent from another tree to set a precedence for this, but I'm drawing a blank. Can anyone think of some?</div>

"Your Faerie Fire spell increases the chance the target will be hit by melee and ranged attacks by 1/2/3%."<br>

Although it appears they've changed the wording, this talent used to affect Feral Faerie Fire. (Yes, that would require a 33+/21+ build). I'm not sure if Feral FF is affected anymore, and I don't really think anyone cares. Most balance druids don't take this talent anyway, it cuts into their points for Sublety.</div>

<br>
I suppose you could make the argument that Rend is trainable, and to just use that. But having Improved Zerker stance and Improved WW in Fury, then Improved Rend in Arms makes them seem...opposed? Unless they change Rend to be useable in all three stances, having to stance dance every 10 seconds (or however long it is) to reapply Rend sounds infuriating at best.</div>

Nearly every release of new gear sees gaping holes in itemization and often has us stealing gear from rogues or hunters. There doesn't seem to be an avenue to even get that frustration out. During TBC beta I submitted dozens of tickets due to the lack of dps plate upgrades along with stats in the wrong area (too much stam, use of agil instead of crit, etc). At the end of the day they just need to balance out crit, strength, hit and enough stam to keep us alive; then toss in some nice flavor stats here and there (-armor, haste, +bonus damage to xxx).</div>

</div>I can't muster much sympathy for Arms at the moment. Let them have their dominance in PvP, their dead-certain spot on any serious arena team, and their face smashing. I have to spec Arms if I want to be anything but a joke in PvP, I don't think it's unreasonable to expect that warriors have to spec for PvE in order to maximize their PvE performance.<br>
<br>
<br>
As for moving Blood Frenzy, giving Fury Deep Wounds is probably too much to hope for, but honestly, I'd be totally fine with it with no other changes. <br>

Fury/Protection warriors give up PvE damage in order to improve tanking ability. Maybe this would be one of those things they have to give up?</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I'm talking about switching BF to Fury. I'm pretty sure the only two wayt to keep BF up are through rend and Deep Wounds. I'm also pretty sure Deep Wounds isn't in Fury. Moving BF to Fury would then require 17 points in Arms, eliminating Fury/Prot...unless you wanted to switch stances and Rend (which, as you say, is a massive waste of a debuff slot).<br>
<br>
Basically, BF to Fury won't happen unless they move Deep Wounds/Impale to Fury as well.</div>

				<strong>Sword Spec increasing in usefulness?</strong>

		<div id="post_message_514887">Hi guys, been reading some time here, first post, so be gentle please <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304081036im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/wink.gif" border="0" alt="" title=";)" class="inlineimg"><br>
<br>
Yesterday while trying to fall asleep a thought occured to me. With the recent changes to the trees, especially Weapon Mastery, sword Spec might grow superior to poleaxe spec. Though it might be quite obvious why I come to this oppinion, let me elaborate <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304081036im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/wink.gif" border="0" alt="" title=";)" class="inlineimg"><br>
<br>
The reason I until now prefered poleaxe over sword was, beside "ZOMG MOAR CRIT IN TEH SHEET!" the reliability. An increase in critrate is always an increase in dps when it occurs (assuming you´re not critcapping <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304081036im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/wink.gif" border="0" alt="" title=";)" class="inlineimg"> ). However, sword specs extra attack had a chance to miss, be dodged or rarely be parried. Reaching the hitcap as a Slambuild is a no brainer, parrying isnt a real factor so basically your sword spec hit could hit, crit, glance or be dodged. Now we can almost eliminate the dodgefactor with some little weaponskill and most importantly Weapon Mastery.<br>
I´m not too familiar with the hit tables, so i don´t know the effects crit and glancing have on each other, so I´ll just ignore glancings for the sake of my point.<br>
Axe spec gives you 5% more crit, flat out. Sword Spec gives you basically 5% of an extra attack, which in terms of dmg comes out nearly the same with 1% chance to be dodged.But what if the sword spec crits? This would equal triple dmg on a sword spec, and if the hit causing it was a crit anyway quadruple dmg!<br>
<br>
Maybe the effects arent as big as I hope it would be. Maybe one of you can shed some light on the point of glancings...</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Whats really strange is how they claim to be itemizing S3 for pvp and T6 for pve when Agility, which is very prominent on T6 is clearly a better pvp stat since it offers both dodge, armor and crit. All the while S3 gets both hit, crit and armor pen.</div>

</div>Keep agility away from the pvp-armor please, it's worse for pvp than it is for pve. That said, I too would like to see straight ratings instead of agility on pve-gear.<br>
<br>
<br>
As for BF/Deep Wounds/Rend, I've always looked at these as a "bleed-theme" that they seem bent on keeping in arms. I have no issues with them staying where they are as I am a supporter of keeping different specs viable for multiple roles, with a slight lead in their respective percieved areas of the game (pve fury - pvp arms), and I think BF is arms main ticket into this pve-part. Making Deep Wounds stack in some way would perhaps help keep it more in the "feel" of arms, cutting stuff up with big blades. As it is I really feel it overwrites itself too fast/often to be of much use damage-wise.<br>
<br>
With the 2.3 changes to the trees however, as Mjollnir said, fury seems to be out of a job. Its gonna depend a lot on how good whirlwind hitting with the offhand will be in practice when people get used to it, along with the reworked Weapon Mastery I think.<br>
<br>
Concerning Enrage/Flurry. Unlink them. As it is, it doesn't make any sense. I fully support this.<br>
Contrary to what many feel though, I wouldn't want to see them just switch Enrage and Dual Weild-spec as it would do nothing for anyone wanting to use 2hand-fury.<br>
<br>
Better streamlining and minor adjustments should be enough to keep fury where it is, i.e. not looking for a job.</div>

</div>Well the difference in DPS may be minimal but that does not tell the whole story.  Assuming Deathwish is the same DPS as 2/2 Imp WW and 2/2 Weapon Mastery...you just spent 3 extra talent points to get the same DPS.  That sucks.<br>
<br>
Also, how many fights are you really threat capped on?  In Hyjal and BT the only one I am *always* threat capped on is Bloodboil.  Most of the others, I am never threat capped on...rarely I am on Gorefiend, and Essence of Anger will usually turn on me in the last 1-2% due to sick executes, but at point the fight is over.<br>
<br>
What needs to happen is Enrage needs to be moved to Arms.  Its a blackhole for talent points and serves no purpose in Fury except to double the cost of Flurry.</div>

</div>Well 'destroys' is hyperbole I suppose but at the end game level of gear its relatively small gains everywhere.  What I meant by 'destroys' is that the gap between the leather Illidan hat and the next best option is larger than with other gear slots.  To put it another way, it is the biggest upgrade over other T6 armor choices.<br>

		<div id="post_message_515238">I've been biting my tongue the last few days waiting for the dust to settle before i weight in on the changes coming up, and i won't have a full grasp of the difference until i actually play with it in a raid, but here are my opinions so far.<br>
<br>
DW and SS swap....&lt;sigh&gt; On demand burst...gone. Really nice when you were in execute range, or the mob had a "vulnerable" phase (demon form Leo is a good example). I can see the SS and new WW combo being deadly in some multi-mob situations, but again, mostly trash. We don't raid and have issues with trash though, it's bosses that you want all the real hitting power for, and what we gear/play for.<br>
<br>
I've got to say that I'm eagerly awaiting the new WW though, even on single mobs it should be nice (I know the math shows it's only going to be a 2-3% increase in DPS, but i run slow/slow, so i should get the most out of it). It will be especially nice for improving the rage efficiency of WW in low rage situations. A good example of this is Vash'j, I was assigned a quadrant and nothing would suck more then when i dropped 25 rage on a whirlwind that hit for around 550...such a waste of rage.<br>
<br>
Weapon Mastery. Sounds good, but I have no idea where I'm going to get the points for it. Which leads me to my next point, Enrage and Flurry. UNLINK THEM, for the love of god. Spending 10 talent points for a 25% haste is nice and all...but shaman spend 5 for 30%, getting better then double our return per talent point in a PvE situation. <br>
<br>
BF moving into fury would be nice, but i could live with just enrage/flurry unlinked.<br>
<br>
I really don't know what blizzard is thinking with these changes. All the cries about warriors up until now have been "Arms is over powered in PvP, Fury is okay as it is in PvE and sucks in PvP".....then the pseudo-buff arms and nerf fury? What's that all about?</div>

</div>The official reasoning behind the deathwish and imp. intercept change is to open up 41 arms talent builds for pvp warriors.<br>
<br>
Kalgan stated that he would not be buffing 41 arms to the point where it was better than those 2 talents so the alternative was moving them or giving them for free to all warriors. I think they're gonna see how the current changes will work out and continue to tweak untill both specs work well for their purpose (fury being the pure dps tree, and arms being the pvp/utility tree).</div>

</div>All trees are between two and four last time I checked.<br>
<br>
Many of the talents at least off hand are sort of no brainers that are linked.  Shadow priests for example have a very long linked set starting at VE.  Imp ve to the side, shadow form further down, and VT linked from shadow form.<br>
<br>
But would anyone NOT get VE/SF/and VT?<br>
<br>
Clearly not every class is like that, but from memory I don't think any are quite as poor in concept as Enrage--&gt;Flurry.</div>

</div>I find this a bit of a funny conclusion to draw. Yes,  Shaman's get better than double the return per talent point for THOSE talents. But we have to take Ancestral Knowledge or Shield Spec in order to get access to those. Points which are every bit as ineffective as Enrage.</div>

		<div id="post_message_515591">@Hamiburg; It's a flawed comparison, but it is somewhat accurate. Shaman start with less and logically have to get more out of their talents to be competitive....but it really pains me to see better talents, easier to get, lower in the tree.<br>
<br>
I don't want to get into a "Well unbridled wrath sucks as much as the +5% mana talent". "Well you get your 5% crit talent before we do!", type of discussion. It just seems like there's very little waste in the enhancement tree (Other then the awful 10-15 gap with only 2h spec and enhancing totems really being helpful) compared to fury. You aren't stuck with a 5 point "LOL Arms PvP talent" as a pre-req for your flurry, you get 9% hit from 6 talent points compared to our 3% for 3 (Mainly because of itemization issues i'd assume...we dont need int/spirit/mp5) and the rest of our talents pretty much match up other wise.<br>
<br>
And there is almost NO case that can be made for enrage being useful in PvE...the only time i get crit and NOT 1 shot is usually AoE trash like solarian packs, Solarian herself and tidewalker...and it's a token increase in damage in the long run because of that. If it had a chance to proc when WE crit (like 5% chance when we crit or something...1/2/3/4/5% chance on crit to increase damage by 5/10/15/20/25% for 10 seconds or something...of course criting would become insane when stacked with flurry then) then it wouldn't be COMPLETELY worthless and we wouldn't be whining as much as we are. I mean, if there wasn't anything else to take we wouldn't care as much either...but we are missing out on Weapon Mastery, Imp whirlwind or points in dual wield for....utter crap.<br>
<br>
To give you an example of how much this sucks...Imagine if imp ghost wolf was 5 points and was needed for you to get flurry.</div>

</div>You mean other than the 12.5% damage shamans are missing on every offhand hit from your version of improved DW? <br>

Enrage is horrible in raid situations, but it's extremely good while leveling and grinding and in non-arena PVP. The real truth is the rest of the talents in the tree are extremely good and scraping for points simply accentuates how much Enrage is bad in raids. If there was a dead zone in the tree but enrage sat there (like there is at 6-10 points, and I'm not suggesting to move it there), nobody would complain because it was just something you had to take to get Flurry anyway.</div>

</div>You obviously didn't pull out a calculator to figure out what 5% mana is for a shaman that has *maybe* 7k raid buffed mana, and has a 2min cooldown talent that can refill that mana bar faster than we can burn the  mana, did you? We also are almost forced to take 3 points for 3% dodge to get to lower in the tree. Its painful for everyone. Stop comparing class trees, its an exercise in stupidity.<br>

Do they really think this will get PvP warriors to spec the 41 pt arms talent?  Hell no it won't because right now PvP warriors are all wanking off to idea that they will be able to pull off a DW-&gt;SS-&gt;Intercept-&gt;WW combo without stance dancing.</div>

</div>41/20 can still get enrage. Though I don't really want to give up TM so that is an issue.<br>
<br>
The point though is that not taking imp. intercept for arena was downright insane, Death Wish actually is not as important after they made it not stack. The patch tries to fix the fact that no sane warrior was ever gonna spec beyond 35 arms, I'm not really sure if it's gonna be successful, but I'm at least gonna try endless rage and improved MS and see how they play before deciding, further changes may be necessary to make them really viable though.<br>
<br>
Note: I'm not actually arguing that deep arms will be superior after 2.3, just that it will be possible to spec without getting laughed at.</div>

</div>Buffed SS? I'm not sure how 2H warriors are going to pull 10 hits per second out of their ass, but I'd be impressed. SS in Arms was good because you could pop it when you had a ton of extra rage and lay waste to a clumped up group of enemy players (or mobs, depending on the circumstances). The new SS will let you get off one good BT hit, some mediocre WW damage, and break every sheep/shackle within a country mile.<br>
<br>
It seems like (unless expertise is as powerful as pre-TBC weaponskill) the gap between Fury and Arms has been closed even more for single target raid DPS.</div>

</div>No I made a typo.  I meant to convey that assuming the loss of Deathwish is offset, on paper, by 2/2 Weapon Mastery and the new WW (of which talented costs 2 points) then we would need to spend 4 talent points to get the same DPS we could formerly get with 1.</div>

</div>I think I meant to reply to someone else, but my point was that moving BF would be dumb. Right now both arms and fury are competitive in PvE and I think that's a good thing. I'd much rather see fury get PvP buffs to make it more desirable in that facet than see Blizzard try to make the two specs more specialized than they are now</div>

		<div id="post_message_516546">Blizzard doesn't want to have all goodies in one tree because they wan't the talent allocation to be something special to every character. For example, look at the Rogue talent trees. After the patch they'll be able to go every tree for their PvP spec but it'll still be different to a PvE spec because of all the small talent choices, and even with a spec like 41/20 you have to choose around 15 points from many useful talents. All this results in a near impossibility to find two totally equal specced Rogues who didn't copy someone else's spec. WoW would be boring if talent trees didn't work this way and I'm pretty happy with Arms and Fury Warriors being viable damage dealers.</div>

I love Arms, I respec once a week to get my welfare epics, but come on.<br>

I am fine with this change long term as long as they realize that, because of the change, it takes us MORE talent points (17/44) to get the same DPS, and act accordingly.  Unlink Enrage from Flurry.</div>

</div>I don't think it will make more warriors go all the way down Arms. To get imp mortal strike and Endless rage you'd have to give up imp slam, weapon mastery, sweeping strikes and flurry which is just not worth it.<br>
<br>
I really don't see why people are calling this an Arms buff either. Any warrior with a brain didn't go past 35 points in Arms and made sure they grabbed Deathwish. The talent swap changes pretty much nothing for pvp and is a minor nerf for pve because they took a desired pve talent (weapon mastery) and swapped it with an undesired talent (imp intercept). In 2.3 two filler talent points have to be taken in Arms to get to the 31 point level and a choice has to be made to drop either Imp Execute, Slam, and Weapon Mastery or dropping sweeping strikes to 1/2 one of them.</div>

</div>It's not about static DPS.  If we were bashing on a static boss with no buffs but our own then yes, the DPS difference would probably compensate with the new whirlwind change and threat reduction.  In a real life Deathwish is used during boss phases when it is weaker or when it is possible to DPS at all, coupled with other buffs, such as drums, haste potion, trinkets, heroism, recklessness.  These amplify the effect of Deathwish.  It's an on demand DPS increase, 2 minute cool down, 30 second duration 20% increase, how can you possibly think a hit with my offhand every 10 seconds or so will compensate?<br>

It's been stated over and over, but the unlinking of enrage would help in so many ways the more I consider it.<br>

With 5 more points you could get the 2/2 Weapon Expertise, and then decide between maxing Imp WW. or going 3/3 in something like Tactical mastery which would be a tanking buff (I haven't seen any metric on the threat increase.) and might make that terrible 2/4 tier 5 set bonus less shithouse.</div>

	</table>
</div>I'm not sure how everyone specs Fury but for my part, when I spec DW Fury I typically skip Improved Intercept in favour of Improved Execute.  The swapping of Improved Intercept and Weapon Mastery means I need to find two points for it, yet there's no "filler" for me to take the points from - i'd have to give up Improved Execute, take two points out of DW spec, or some combination.<br>
<br>
It brings up the greater question of 21/40.  Setting aside Rampage for the moment, limiting Fury to 40 points is a fairly big hit to it.  The question arises again, where do you cut points from to squeeze under a cap of 40?  There are only a limited number of places those points can come from and nearly all of them are essential to DW Fury - places like Precision, Dual Wield Specialization, Improved Execute, Weapon Mastery, maybe a point from Commanding Presence.  Unlinking Enrage from Flurry (or swapping DW spec with Flurry) would go a long way to streamlining Fury spec.<br>
<br>
There is also the point of where do you *put* the points in Arms in such a way that they are beneficial to DW.  17 points are straightforward - progression towards Impale.  But then you have three points that are basically filler.<br>
<br>
Right now if you want to build a 21/40 Fury spec you might as well mash it into 2h Fury.  That way you can take the points you need from Precision and DW spec, and allocate them meaningfully into 2h spec over in Arms.<br>
<br>
And as many others have noted, moving Death Wish over to Arms doesn't change the cookie cutter Arms spec at all.  I'm very tempted to go back to it, especially given that i've lost my freebie 3% hit human cheese.  Blood Frenzy in Arms is very enticing.</div>

</div>Yes even if we assume that the DPS loss from Deathwish going away is offset by the new or improved talents...we dont have the points to pick them all up.<br>

So, if this is going to happen, Enrage needs to be unlinked from Flurry.</div>

</div>I have no idea if that's the case or not but assuming it is for the sake of discussion it's just a pointless exercise on Blizzard's part.   The vast majority of players in this game are inherently min-maxers.   They will gravitate to the "single" best spec for thier role and by default make it the new cookie cutter spec.<br>
<br>
Blizzard can only change what the cookie cutter specs are.   They can't eliminate thier existence and if they actually believe they can then they are fools.</div>

Weapon mastery is going to give -2% dodge per talent point, making it better than Precision (1%hit per talent point) and very probably better than each point in Imp Execute (at least that's what playing with spreadsheets tell me).

</div>Yeah, that would be extremely dumb. If you're looking for a PvE tanking talent Defiance is a fantastic talent without the expertise; if the bonus only shows up in defensive stance then it makes the talent even stronger than it already was in that specific niche and benefits no other role.</div>

</div>I'm still convinced that the motivation behind the change is getting more people to spec full arms. I can't think of any other talent tree where nobody would ever spec 41 points, besides survival maybe, that is a pretty big issue for the designers. All 41 point talents are made to be viable, if one is not they will try and fix it. It's not a coincidence that both Circle of Healing and Pain Suppression were tweaked in this patch as well.</div>

</div>It's just not going to happen until Improve Slam goes somewhere else. The problem is it's not an arms ability (though obviously they just violated that rule) so it doesn't really belong in the arms tree and if they were going to make that switch, I would have suspected that it would have been done instead of moving Improved Intercept. They can't really move it up in the tree because you don't get the ability until level 30 -- it's one of those rare cases where you can put a talent point in it before you attain the ability while leveling. <br>
<br>
Also regarding Defiance: my guess is they were lazy and made the expertise a part of the Defiance aura instead of adding it as its own buff.</div>

		<div id="post_message_517435">I'm interested in the implications of this Deathwish - Sweeping Strikes switch for Fury specs.<br>
<br>
Since Rampage does not scale with gear (only with ranks obtained by levels), at some point, even assuming 100% uptime on Rampage, would not Deathwish come out on top as being a superior choice for damage?<br>
<br>
Also, the activation feature of Deathwish allows for more control and the ability to gain the benefit during a vulnerable phase in a boss.<br>
<br>
<br>
Here is what I am coming up with (this might be totally whack; I am using ingame tooltips for these calculations).<br>
<br>
250 AP bonus from Rampage = flat 17.8 dps over the course of the fight. Over a 3 minute fight, this will give +3,204 damage.<br>
<br>
20% bonus from Deathwish = During 3 minutes of a fight, :30 will be at 120% damage, and the other 2:30 will be at 100% damage. Assuming 1k dps (for simplicity), :30 of Deathwish will give 1.2k x 30 = 36k damage, or a 6,000 damage increase.<br>
<br>
<br>
Looks like the inflection point is well under 1k dps. Does this mean that Rampage is an obsolete talent now?</div>

Aside from the Talon, the best options we'll have for slow OH in T5 content (assuming we're considering ZA as vaguely T5-esque) will be from Zul'Aman.<br>

</div>No need to fret, all you have to do is get an arena 1h weapon (the weapon thats intended to use in the mainhand) and put it in your offhand.<br>

And better yet, S3 arena weapons put anything else to shame for offhand use.<br>
Why wait for drops when there is free stuff to be had.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I'm interested in the implications of this Deathwish - Sweeping Strikes switch for Fury specs.<br>
<br>
Since Rampage does not scale with gear (only with ranks obtained by levels), at some point, even assuming 100% uptime on Rampage, would not Deathwish come out on top as being a superior choice for damage?<br>
<br>
Also, the activation feature of Deathwish allows for more control and the ability to gain the benefit during a vulnerable phase in a boss.<br>
<br>
<br>
Here is what I am coming up with (this might be totally whack; I am using ingame tooltips for these calculations).<br>
<br>
250 AP bonus from Rampage = flat 17.8 dps over the course of the fight. Over a 3 minute fight, this will give +3,204 damage.<br>
<br>
20% bonus from Deathwish = During 3 minutes of a fight, :30 will be at 120% damage, and the other 2:30 will be at 100% damage. Assuming 1k dps (for simplicity), :30 of Deathwish will give 1.2k x 30 = 36k damage, or a 6,000 damage increase.<br>
<br>
<br>
Looks like the inflection point is well under 1k dps. Does this mean that Rampage is an obsolete talent now?</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</div>That is somewhat correct with a 2hander.<br>
<br>
However, dual wielding with IMP DW talent adding 12.5% to your off hand damage along with IMP BS (putting RP up to 275 AP) adds alot more. <br>
<br>
MH: 275 AP / 14 = 19.6 DPS<br>
OH: 275 AP * 0.625 IMP DW = 171.9 AP / 14 = 12.3 DPS<br>
<br>
19.6 MH + 12.3 OH = 31.9 DPS x 180s = 5,742 DAM<br>
<br>
Not much behind Deathwish there and alot better sustained DPS. With the whirlwind changes among other things (Flurry will be up more often) it should go well over 6k. Causing alot more reliable and predictable threat.</div>

</div>I imagine it's like we originally thought. Take away Death Wish, give minor buffs, see how Fury performs, and buff again over the next course of patches if Fury DPS is lower then it used to be without Death Wish. I've seen it happen with other classes at least.<br>
<br>
Patch 1: Take away Death Wish, give us the new Whirlwind, and -1% dodge<br>
Patch 2: Buff -1% dodge to -2%.<br>
<br>
I'm almost certain that Fury is going to be weaker immediately following the patch, and fixed later down the line, and we'll just have to deal with it.</div>

</div>Every talent tree has at least one linked talent, if not more, as mentioned earlier in this thread.  The only thing that makes sense is DW specialization if it isn't enrage.  And this would free up 5 points to spread around the fury goodness, namely whirlwind (that second point will be more important now) and weapon mastery while being able to keep improved execute, which is still a very nice PvE talent.</div>

I also think that Sweeping Strikes should not be linked to anything.

</div>Enrage isn't entirely useless, fights with adds have a chance to proc it and right now I'm doing pve in a significant amount of resilience (over 200) so *any* damage I take has a 5-6% chance of triggering enrage.<br>
<br>
I'm not trying to pass it off as something incredible, but at least it does something. DW spec would just be 5 absolutely useless points to put 3 in an extremely good talent. It would also make the talent trees feel more restrictive "If you want to 2h you must be arms, if you want to dw you must be fury, if you want to swoard/board you must be prot" which isn't true. 2H fury does respectable damage, so why shouldn't it have a viable path down the fury tree as well?</div>

</div>That doesn't solve the problem. Instead of dual-wielding warriors having to waste 5 points to get Flurry, 2-hand warriors would have to waste 5 points to get Flurry.<br>
<br>
In my opinion, a small reduction in the points required to get the required talents would be preferable, for example reducing some of the 5-point talents to 3 points with the same effect. Right now, and even more so in 2.3, there is very little freedom for DW Fury warriors to spend their points, almost everyone has the same spec, and I don't think any dedicated DW PvE-warriors will consider taking the improved tactical mastery, however nice it is for DPS-warrior tanking utility, simply because they can't spare the points.</div>

</div>Uhm, did I overlook something or why is a 10% threat reduction talent a significant PvP buff?<br>
<br>
Point is: Arms PvE spec is more or less unaffected after the patch, plus you get most of the PvP goodies as well.<br>
All the buffs to fury tree look nice, still you can either decide between ditching deep wounds and impale or leaving out one of those nifty new talents, which should improve PvE dps. Unlinking enrage or a point reduction in talents like DW spec could fix that.<br>
<br>
Unless you run with a 2nd warrior, fury has no place in arena in my opinion. MS is just too strong in group pvp and even if you would take a 2nd melee, you would probably take a rogue for CC/timers. Fair trade off would be to make fury the king of PvE dps, but sadly thats not true at the moment.</div>

</div>People tend to really underestimate the Relentless Earthstorm Diamond, particularly now that it is fixed again. I'm a firm believer of the fact that the <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302212747/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=29021"><span  ><span class="purplename">[Warbringer Battle-Helm]</span></span></a> is better than the <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302212747/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=29983"><span  ><span class="purplename">[Fel-Steel Warhelm]</span></span></a> because of its meta socket and easy socket bonus.<br>
<br>
Coming back to the 2.3 changes, I am extremely dissapointed in the reduction in effectiveness of weapon mastery. Its still a buff from precision, however I can't help but feel that we are back in the initial state of the patching being a nerf to Fury overall.<br>
<br>
Frankly the reasons for the Deathwish change cited by Bornakk don't make any sense:<br>
<br>
<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px; ">
	<div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom:0px"><img src="/web/20080302212747im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/chestnut/misc/citation.gif" border="0"></div>

	<tr>
		<td class="alt2" style="border:1px inset">
			
				Some warriors felt forced to pickup certain talents and this left them with few options. This change could allow people in these situations to have some extra options while the weapon expertise and threat reduction improvements to the deep end of the fury tree allow for more consistent sustained damage.
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</div>The ONLY thing accomplished by the Deathwish change is to prevent Fury warriors from getting it. That's IT. No PvP warrior is suddenly going to go high arms, they're all going to STILL go 33/28 for flurry, enrage and improved slam.<br>
<br>
The change to improved berserker stance was something of a surprise - I was actually thinking that they should replace Improved Mortal Strike with a talent called "Inner Balance" that would remove 2/4/6/8/10% of the bonus damage in Berserker Stance, as it would be more of a PvP benefit. It might also make deep arms more worthwhile.</div>

- Increases AP in zerk stance by 2/4/6/8/10%<br>
- Decreases threat gen in zerk stance by 2/4/6/8/10%<br>
- Decreases dmg taken in zerk stance by 2/4/6/8/10% (effectively giving zerk stance 3% additional crit, with no inc dmg penalty)?</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Enrage isn't entirely useless, fights with adds have a chance to proc it and right now I'm doing pve in a significant amount of resilience (over 200) so *any* damage I take has a 5-6% chance of triggering enrage.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</div>I think the argument here is that Enrage is useless given the synergy of why people spec for it. (And for the record, the trees 'Arms' 'Fury' 'Prot' refer to a 'Weapon Master' 'Warcry/Rallier' 'Inpregnable' warrior- hence, Enrage belongs in the Fury tree themewise).<br>
It being in the Fury tree as a prereq for Flurry is the issue. Those speccing Flurry are speccing for purebred dps. Sure, as a fury/prot raider I enjoyed having Enrage proc while on tanking duty (the aforementioned resilience benefit), but it does absolutely nothing for me dps-wise. And, of course, the only reason I picked it up, was for Flurry. There is no <i>synergy</i> between the talents, albeit both are synergic with the overall Fury theme.</div>

</div>Haste doesn't effect your yellow damage directly; it effects it indirectly (obviously) because haste=more white damage, which=more rage for specials. In my (slightly intoxicated) opinion, it seems like with DST and Dragonstrike, you have a pretty good amount of haste from procs/swiftseel as is. I'd be looking for more AP, and perhaps armor penetration. Obviously get Executioner when 2.3 hits; you could probably drop some +hit as well, if that helps any.</div>

</div>I don't know if enrage proccing off the resilience mechanic on damage that can otherwise not crit (most AOE PVE damage) is an intended function.  It would seem to me to violate the Blizzard agenda of PVE gear for PVE and PVP gear for PVP.  Maybe it will be "fixed" in the future.  As such, is it really valid to use it as justification for the value of enrage for PVE dps?  Resilience mechanic aside, the only time I've made meaningful use of enrage in a raid is when I get stuck tanking in DPS gear (loose trash or a weaker mob I pull onto myself as a rage buddy to cleave dump into AOE type trash).  However, for Fury PVP viability, it is fairly key.  If you can't DPS someone down fast, you are more or less dead weight.<br>
<br>
The more I look at it, it looks to me like Fury is basically treading water in the next patch.  You lose deathwish.  You pick up -4% (it better be 4%!!!) dodge, 62.5% more WW damage on single target at the expense of either 2 (or maybe 1) points of precision/imp execute.  Trash and farming dps increases.  Single target min/maxxed DPS probably takes a slight hit but has more aggro space.  Meh.</div>

 Your justification for enrage in the PVE tree mikebro, just doesn't make sense. For the majority of people who spec fury for PVE, enrage is just wasted space. Enrage is a PVP ability. <br>

What blizzard should do is remove imp MS, and replace that with enrage. That accomplishes both making arms warriors spec deeper arms, while breaking up the cookie cutter build.

</div><i>The</i> pve tree? I don't think that is a fair classification considering every Warrior talent tree can play an extremely viable raiding roll except for deep Arms (41+), which isn't good for anything.<br>
<br>
For at least the third time, I'm not saying that the middle tiers of the Fury tree are well layed out, I do think that there should/will be changes but I do think that swapping DW and Enrage like many people have suggested is nothing but a pipe dream unless the DW raiding situation gets really bad. I don't think Enrage is an incredible talent, I'm not even saying it's good, all I'm saying is that it's better than a 100% completely useless DW spec for both Arms and 2H Fury warriors.<br>
<br>
Also, I don't know how many times it has to be said, but: <b>No PVE Arms warrior is going to spec more than 33 points in to Arms until Slam, Weapon Mastery, and Flurry are moved in to those deeper positions in Arms</b> or new ridiculously overpowered talents are released to replace Imp MS and Endless rage.<br>
<br>
In regards to the changes they made to make the last few talents in Arms a bit more appealing, I don't really buy it. Unless they're just slowly taking it step by step addings stuff, their excuse for moving Deathwish to Arms was just a scapegoat. They're probably more worried about Fury warriors catching up to rogues in PVE with the new threat reduction. Weapon Mastery is amazing for PVP since everyone has at least ~5% dodge and it allows you to put +70AP or Executioner on your weapon, and Sweeping Strikes almost seems like a requisite for beating Warlock/XYZ 2v2 teams when I play with Druid/Warrior and the talents mentioned in the paragraph above are pretty much 100% required to remain competitive in PVE.</div>

</div>This is what they think they're doing. In practice it won't work, 21+ in fury is still better than 34+ in arms. Flurry is just better.<br>
<br>
The net effect of the changes is consolidation of Arms as the PvP tree, and a (probably slight) nerf to Fury in the removal of a signature Fury talent. Which irritates me. I hear warriors insisting that Arms should be even with Fury for raid dps. Why? Fury isn't even with Arms for arena. Hell, fury isn't good for arena at all, not to a serious team. Mortal Strike is just better, from what I've seen and read.<br>
<br>
If blizzard wants to considate warrior talents into a PvP tree, a PvE damage tree, and a tanking tree, (which the changes to arms seems to indicate they do want to do) they should actually do that. Give fury Blood Frenzy. It would make the vast majority of the bitching go away.</div>

</div>Maybe it should be, but it wasn't as strong as 31/20 in pre-tbc (in my opinion anyhow.  Though fury was far more viable than it is now) I'm not holding out for them to change anything, I'm not even really sure what they could do, besides pipe dream stuff like completely working rampage.</div>

		<div id="post_message_522859">On a slightly different note I am considering the "future" of my DPS warrior right now.  The change to Windfury totem enticed me to Fury; now the loss of Death Wish is drawing me back to Arms and Mortal Strike.  So, I have a question to that effect.<br>
<br>
I cannot recall precisely in which thread, but a long time ago somebody posted a "break even" point of Attack Power, whereby with X attack power, one would hit as hard with Bloodthirst as they do with Mortal Strike + Gorehowl.  Obviously i've progressed beyond Gorehowl, and am looking to find what the "break even" AP point might be for Mortal Strike + Cataclysm's Edge, but I don't know the math of how to go about finding it.  So my question is, at what amount of attack power would Bloodthirst hit harder than MS w/Cataclysm's Edge?<br>
<br>
I ask mainly because I am tossing up, in my head, 21/40 versus 31/30.  I may stay Fury but I find myself liking the playstyle a lot less these days.</div>

AP*0.45 - AP/14*3.4 = 693<br>
AP (0.45 - .2428) = 693<br>
AP = 3345<br>
<br>
Edit: Even if you find that BT hits slightly harder than MS raid buffed, I think that Sword Spec &gt; Imp Berserker Stance for damage. If you don't already have a BF warrior in your raid I definitely recommend going 33/28.</div>

		<div id="post_message_522952">Lets look at this overall.<br>
<br>
Arms is far far better then fury for arena/pvp. So much so that fury isn't even considered. This is mainly due to mortal strike, death wish, imp intercept and the fact that you can get all the good PvP and PvE fury talents necessary with the remaining 28-30 points.<br>
<br>
Arms does less PvE damage then fury by a slight amount. Blood Frenzy makes the overall Arms DPS contribution greater then fury (in most cases....look back 10+ pages for the math that was done).<br>
<br>
So...if you want to do well in arena...spec arms.<br>
Want your raid to do more damage overall? Spec arms.<br>
Want to do the most personal damage? Spec Fury.<br>
<br>
Fury comes into it's own when there's another warrior putting Blood frenzy up...so we are the SECOND dps warrior.<br>
<br>
Arms also has the advantage of being versatile....so you don't have to respec for PvP/PvE.<br>
<br>
1 of 2 things needs to happen;<br>
<br>
1. Fury needs PvP viability so that it matches arms...we won't have imp intercept, death wish, mortal strike next patch.<br>
2. Fury needs to be the CLEAR PvE dps king to the point that speccing arms for PvE would be the same level of stupidity as speccing fury for PvP is now.<br>
<br>
My suggestions; Blood frenzy to fury, unlink enrage and flurry. That makes Fury an excellent PvE dps tree while only removing a token amount of arms warriors PvP viability.<br>
<br>
I have a feeling that we will see fury improvements in the future though, the fury tree is too....scattered ATM to remain as is.</div>

</div>Oh yes you do, unless your idea of PvP is rolling PUGs for easy honor, in which case who cares what spec you are.<br>
<br>
Trying to PvP as a 33/28 PvE warrior, missing Second Wind, Imp Hamstring, Imp Intercept, only 1 point in Imp Overpower... it's painful and frustrating. Plus the fact that I use Lionheart Executioner for PvE but also have a World Breaker lying around, not being able to take advantage of mace spec (broken or not) is also a killer.<br>
<br>
Can it be pulled off? Yes, and better than Fury. But it's nowhere near optimal, and against good players you're going to lose because of the differences.</div>

</div>This would really only be true if rage were infinite. It costs more rage to do the same amount of damage with a 3.5 speed weapon than it would with a 3.8 speed weapon with slam, while generating the same amount of rage. If it was possible to maintain a SLAM -&gt; MS -&gt; SLAM -&gt; WW -&gt; SLAM -&gt; MS -&gt; SLAM -&gt; whatever cycle 100% of the time then I may agree with you. Even then though, due to latency/brain lag, more slams is more time lost doing white damage. I'm sure there are more reasons like slam increases the swing time by of a faster weapon by a larger percentage than a slower weapon since it is always 0.5 second cast time no matter what, but I am no expert theorycrafter nor do I aspire to be one.</div>

</div>There is a slight benefit in that if you have some lag in your slam application (the time from the autoattack to when you press the slam button) there will be a slight increase in damage.<br>
<br>
Assuming 0.2 seconds lag<br>
<br>
A 3.0 speed weapon will have its lagged speed be 3.2 seconds<br>
A 4.0 speed weapon will have its lagged speed be 4.2 seconds<br>
<br>
3/3.2 = 0.9375<br>
4/4.2 = 0.9524<br>
<br>
0.9524/0.9375 = 1.0159<br>
Thus with 0.2 seconds of lag a 4.0 speed weapon will produce 1.6% more damage from slam+autoattack than a 3.0 speed weapon.<br>
<br>
Now granted the difference between a 3.6 speed weapon and a 3.8 speed weapon is pretty marginal but it is there.</div>

</div>See, I never really knew for sure that when a mob seemed to "turn around" to cast on someone if it was more than just a graphical display and that it was actually still facing the tank.  I guess that's not the case afterall and the WWS (as well as what others here have said) proves otherwise.  The main reason I didn't think the mob was actually physically turning would be because there are some mobs that cleave that follow this behaviour, but they don't actually cleave anyone when doing this.  Maybe they just stop doing melee while doing random/secondary abilities?</div>

		<div id="post_message_530289">Those are usually reports with bugged splits that read something like 8 million damage done in 4 minutes. Considering it'd currently take the utmost out of tanks to push out 1.2k TPS in that encounter I don't really see how a fury warrior can get away with anything near that. Theoritically in a super ideal sort of situation you could get close I suppose - enrage procs off constructs. 5 heroisms, a 'very' stacked totem twisting group etc. I don't think it's viable threat wise however, dying and stoning back up is still a DPS loss from time/buffs.<br>
<br>
Yes when mobs turn to cast something with RSTS they stop meleeing (usually, I have seen mobs cast/channel and melee/do other things at the same time - a good example would be Illidari Flames + Warstomp combos on the Supremus trash). Though I haven't really checked logs to see if the melee swing is reset. Archimonde and Teron are good example of such busy bees, they often stops meleeing the tank for short periods (out of experience alone though, no numerical proof).</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Using a fast offhand does not increase Heroic Strike use.

</div>You're right that a fast offhand doesn't really increase HS usage (even though I've read some unsubstantiated claims that UW still is slightly better with fast weapons). The main reason for using fast offhands still stand though. You build up rage faster between executes with a fast OH weapon (actually also with a fast MH), giving higher execute damage. <br>

</div>This I can agree with, but then you use an execute swap with two fast weapons once you are below 20%.<br>
<br>
It is also important to realize that Bloodthirst is still more DPR than execute, so you should be doing a BT, E, E rotation or something similar based on rage availability sub-20% when you don't have reck up, so to a certain extent you still need large portions of rage to build up. <br>

</div>Well since I think everything affects execute and BT the same (armor, hit rate, ect.) we can just look at the base damage. <br>
30 rage execute with 7 rage cost is 925+23*21=1408<br>
For BT to hit the same divide it by .45 to find your AP.<br>
Once you have 3129 AP your BT hits harder than a 30 rage execute. The tricky part is making sure that you have that 30 rage 1.5s after your previous execute.</div>

</div>off topic, but the spreadsheet (version before and after 2.3, I think the version before is 9.1 from the old spreadsheet, the 2.3 version is 9.1.6) does work in OpenOffice, you just have to disable all the macros when starting it (answer no when it asks you about the macros). To make it work, unclick mongoose from MH weapon (and OH if it's there) and go to the page Buffed dps. Find the cell "Use Circular refs" and put that to FALSE()  You should now get numbers out from the sheet. You can now change the cell back to TRUE() and put on mongoose again, the sheet should now work.</div>

</div>The only list I recall doing is one that included two Season 3 weapons...which is obviously 2.3.  The list was also done via the most current spreadsheet.  On the previous spreadsheets, prior to the WW change, Boundless Agony was the best off hand, which means it is for now, but it's not after the patch.  Rising Tide isn't below any daggers on the 2.3 list, nor did I mention any fast Season 2 off handers on that list.  The Rising Tide is virtually a clone of the Talon when either are used as off handers.</div>

The other slow one handers in BT/MH aren't all that impressive.  Rising Tide has valuable item points in stamina which should be converted to a dps stat.  All the dps weapons up to MH/BT don't have itemization points in stamina so I don't know why they decided to do it for this one particular item.  Syphon has the slowest speed, but that isn't important for an OH and the proc seems pretty lackluster to me though I have never tried it myself.  Blizzard should implement more slow weapons.</div>

Too many item points are wasted in stamina and hit.  The logical upgrade, were it to happen would result in it looking something like:<br>
<br>
215 - 321 Damage<br>
(103 damage per second)<br>
+35 Stamina<br>
Equip: Improves hit rating by 23.<br>
Equip: Increases attack power by 47.<br>
<br>
Upgraded to that puts it just barely above a 2.6 speed Season 2 axe and right below a Blade of Infamy for off handers.  It's also just right below the T3 smithed weapons as a main hander for those that never took smithing.  I was considering looting one eventually if one was going to rot in hope that it would get boosted enough to actually be worth using, but with 2.3 on the horizon the chances of me taking one is looking pretty slim.</div>

</div>Put it in the Spreadsheet. Really I got this answer and it was the best advice ever. Take the time set it up and you will never look back on gear decisions ever again.<br>

Assuming 5/5 DW spec, then pure contribution from attack power is ((AP/14)*2.4)*1.625 = 0.28*AP, which isn't bad considering it also gets the damage from your weapons added in.

0.17*AP &gt; (weapon damage * 1.625) -&gt; AP*0.10 &gt; weapon damage -&gt; AP &gt; 10*(weapon damage)<br>

Assuming two weapons with an average damage of 250, I believe you'd still be getting more damage out of Bloodthirst if you had more than 2500 attack power (which is practically always true), but it would be close.

</div>The spreadsheet agrees just fine.  Look at the SEP values and then update it each time you add a piece of gear.  The more -AC you add the higher the SEP value is.  The only time adding more -AC gear could be a waste is if your -AC exceeds the bosses AC after it's fully raid debuffed.  And I think you would need around -2300 (?) to even come close to doing that.<br>

</div>Both Berserker's and Madness beat the DST in the optimal dual wield set.  And Onslaught is not even a consideration for the set bonus simply because all of the off set items are superior by themselves.  I highly doubt lowering your Execute cost by 3 and having an additional 80 - 120 dmg per Bloodthirst is going to make up for the wasted stat values on Onslaught.  The Onslaught bp beats the Season 3 by approximately 5 DPS in the best possible gear you can get besides having Warglaives.  It's also obviously easier to get a season 3 chest than it is to get an Onslaught chest if your guild has never downed Illidan yet.</div>

</div>Well, since the spreadsheet is using circular references to calculate the flurry uptime (and some procs I think), it's quite common to get "bouncy" behaviour when you switch gear containing crit, hit or agililty. Update (by, e.g., reselecting the item) the sheet a couple of times after switching in the new item, it will settle down after 2+ updates.<br>
<br>
The discontinuous dps jumps is normally due to that the rage income becomes enough to trigger an extra HS in the cycle.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">The spreadsheet agrees just fine.  Look at the SEP values and then update it each time you add a piece of gear.  The more -AC you add the higher the SEP value is.  The only time adding more -AC gear could be a waste is if your -AC exceeds the bosses AC after it's fully raid debuffed.  And I think you would need around -2300 (?) to even come close to doing that.<br>

</div>Yes but sometimes it just seems that you're not getting that much of a DPS improvement. For example, the Red Belt of Battle still is superior to the new Chain of Unleashed Rage, according to the spreadsheet.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Both Berserker's and Madness beat the DST in the optimal dual wield set.  <b><u>And Onslaught is not even a consideration for the set bonus simply because all of the off set items are superior by themselves</u></b>.  I highly doubt lowering your Execute cost by 3 and having an additional 80 - 120 dmg per Bloodthirst is going to make up for the wasted stat values on Onslaught.  The Onslaught bp beats the Season 3 by approximately 5 DPS in the best possible gear you can get besides having Warglaives.  It's also obviously easier to get a season 3 chest than it is to get an Onslaught chest if your guild has never downed Illidan yet.</div>

Actually, spreadsheet for me shows onslaught chest/shoulders with 3/3 precision and no imp execute as 23 more dps than midnight chestguard/blood-stained shoulders with 1/3 precision and 2/2 imp execute. interesting indeed <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302195202im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/emot-dance.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":dance:" class="inlineimg"><br>

seeing the offline TPS webpage based on a WWS parse gave me an idea about a kind of "rate my DPS skill" page that would bring you a result about the way you play your warrior.

- the use of cooldowned attacks (Bloodthirst / Mortal Strike and Whirlwind) : rate the fact that the attack is done as soon as possible or delayed due to many reasons<br>
- the uptime of BattleShout and Rampage : always up or many downtime (especially Rampage that has to be refreshed during the main attacks cooldown) ?<br>
- the use of Slam : just after a white hit or really delayed ?<br>
- the use of Heroic Strike : to many HS leading to rage problems ? (delayed cooldowned attacks etc.)<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Hi,<br>
<br>
seeing the offline TPS webpage based on a WWS parse gave me an idea about a kind of "rate my DPS skill" page that would bring you a result about the way you play your warrior. It could be usefull to know what has to be changed and improved to increase your DPS depending only on your skill. I don't know how to build this in html/xml or so, but I can write what I've got in mind</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</div>Where is that webpage?<br>
<br>
Btw, dodges are something between 5 and 6.5% percent, according to the weapon skill thread here. And parries between 10 and 12%. Due to the difference, you probably will keep on hitting from behind - too much expertise, for a DPS warrior, to hit the parry cap. Good for tanks tho, human warriors get 11 expertise from the start.</div>

<br>
If whirlwind now hits with both weapons can we assume the following;<br>
<br>
Weapon enchants on the offhand will proc more often. (Potentially making the 20 str enchant inferior to proc based ones like mongoose)<br>
The offhand weapon can individually crit, thereby increasing flurry, deep wounds etc.<br>
The offhand, if its a sword, has a chance of getting an extra attack through sword spec when using whirlwind.<br>
<br>
Thanks in advance.</div>

</div>You can reduce till you hit 0 armor I assume, passed 0 armor it won't help anymore.<br>

How it affects your damage done on a % base depends on the exsisting armor debuffs already on the target and how much ArP you have gathered.</div>

		<div id="post_message_540431">I have a problem that's been nagging me for a couple months. I've seen a few posts about it (in this thread and others), but no satisfactory replies. My problem is that I need a swing timer. And it needs to work. I have never found a timer that works consistently with every swing-resetting or bonus-swing-adding mechanic. Some of them can't deal with windfury; some get confused by sword spec; and some have a freaking meltdown on approximately half of haste-inducing effects (flurry's generally ok, drums of battle less so). And on top of that, I want to use my swing timer to time slams, so I need a lag indicator (much like quartz provides for casters).<br>
<br>
Right now I use the Quartz timer and LD50, one on top of the other. Configured to the same length, I can use the LD50 lag estimator for the Quartz bar, since Quartz is somewhat more reliable--not by a lot, though. Sometimes LD50 resets when it shouldn't, and Quartz picks up the slack; however, the opposite also happens, and a lot more frequently than I'd like. Every now and then they both overestimate swing time, something for which I'm still narrowing down the cause (I think it's a haste effect, but I'll have to see). So I ask you--does anyone have a single, good swing timer?<br>
<br>
As an alternative, I've tried approaching the problem the way hunters do when they weave auto shot between specials. If I could make a spammable /castsequence macro to cast slam when my auto attack completes, that would be an acceptable solution. Unfortunately, I can't. I tried constructing the macro myself, then when I failed, I tried emulating a macro my hunter friend uses for simple auto/steady shot weaving. It doesn't work, and I'm beginning to believe it's not even possible with the current macro system. Has anyone successfully made one of these?</div>

</div>Danath,  it seems If you equip 2x sword or 2x maces you only get 5 expertise rating. But when I euip say Mace in my main hand and a sword in my offhand the expertise seems to stack so I get 10 expertise. Im sure this is a bug that will we ironed out by blizzard before it goes live as it would be over powered.</div>

</div>im probably biased, but you choose stoneform because it was great in PvE and you choose it over the weaponskill. now the weaponskill is getting replaced by something weaker and you absolutly want to have it cause its overpowered. okay.<br>
<br>
i really cant see why anybody should be scared, this changes basically nothing in ranking of races in my opinion. humans had 3% more hit, now they have 2.5% less mob avoidance. there is no big change. which guild is gonna kick a tank because he choose wrong race ? how many guilds are there with gnome or undead or whatever warrior maintank and still killed illidan ?</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I realize the dps spread sheet is for calculating maximum theoretical dps.  I'm 17/44 and with my current gear the spreadsheet recommends 3BS/2WW/3HS rotation.  If I use 1 HS per rotation i'm flying up the aggro list let alone 3HS per rotation.  Do other fury warriors really use HS in raids?  If you don't use HS what do you do with your extra rage?<br>
<br>
The reason I ask is I recently switched to fury when I moved to a new guild.  Any information is appreciated.  I've searched back a few pages in this thread but have not seen anything related to this, even though i'm sure this has been answered before.  Thanks.</div>

</div>I have no problem using HS when I have salvation, when I don't I have to be careful but I can usually squeeze in 1-2 HS per cycle (my gear let's me do 2 at maximum). Maybe our tanks just do very good aggro. The new -10% threat in 2.3 will help a fair bit as well. <br>
<br>
If you can't use the rage to do HS/Cleave (cleave can actually be more threat effective than HS if you have good enough gear, search for the spreadsheet on this by Natural if you're interested), you can't really use it at all, hamstring also does extra threat and does crap damage (but can trigger flurry). Maybe you should offer to keep TC up for your tanks, that will steal a lot of rage.</div>

Expertise as a racial simply means we finally have something worthwhile and yes, humans/orcs are now the preferred choice for fury or DPS in general.  Taurens are still the best tanks, though, imo.<br>

Someone asked about armour penetration.  Basically this stat scales insanely well, every bit of armor penetration you have will give you a higher damage increase than the previous armor penetration you had, it's a linear increase.  The closer you get to the mob's 0 armor (should never happen, in theory) the more each point of armour penetration contributes to DPS.<br>

This table is assuming you have no +hit gear and 20% crit, and you are fighting a normal level 73 boss. Say you roll a 10, that would mean your next attack would be a miss.<br>
<br>
It is important to note the change when you add, say, 1% hit. The table would now look like this:<br>
<br>
0-27: Miss<br>
27-32.6: Dodge<br>
32.6-57.6: Glancing<br>
57.6-77.6: Crit<br>
77.6-100: Hit"<br>

I was wondering how adding 1% crit affected the table? Would it look something like this:<br>
<br>
0-28: Miss<br>
28-33.6: Dodge<br>
33.6-58.6: Glancing<br>
58.6-79.6: Crit<br>
79.6-100: Hit<br>
<br>
or did I misunderstand "<b>While adding 1% hit obviously increased the hit on the table by 1%, it also reduced your miss rate by 1%. The same thing happens when you add crit; you gain 1% crit and lose 1% hit</b>"?</div>

Add 1% Crit and you get 60-80 Crit with 81-100 Hit<br>

</div>Unless it's a fight where you're looking at going from threat capped to generating far less threat with the change to Improved Berserker stance, there is absolutely no way this is true. The ability to leverage Death Wish + Execute + Haste Pot and maybe even a Heroism is what kept Fury dps competitive. No DW Executes is going to be a huge blow. I know that personally when I was Fury, at 19% if I popped a haste pot + Bloodlust Brooch + DW + Recklessness, I'd be pulling something on the order of 2500-3000 DPS for a short period, and this is going to nerf 500+ of that DPS for the duration of Death Wish.<br>
<br>
Edit: To try and make this thought more concrete, some simple math for it. Assuming 500 lost DPS for the execute range Death Wish, 500 DPS x 30 seconds = 15,000 damage lost. Assuming an average length fight, you'd probably use Death Wish one other time before Executes, so maybe that one only loses you something in the range of 10,000 damage, to be conservative. So 25,000 damage lost to Death Wish going away. Assuming 1600 DPS total for the fight, and a 5 minute fight, 2% Dodge being removed is worth around 32 DPS. So 32 DPS x 300 seconds is 9600 damage. Assuming 5 Whirlwinds a minute, you're looking at 25 whirlwinds over a 5 minute fight, so you'd have to do 10,400 damage with 25 offhand hits, or 416 damage average hits with your offhand with WW to equal out the DW loss according to my quick napkin math, I guess. I suppose that puts things closer than I had expected.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">The problem is that this talent and the WW change are expected to make up for the dps loss of Death Wish. I cant find the link but a blue post claimed that they saw a DPS increase in furry with these changes. How many people think this is true?</div>

</div>I'm skeptical.<br>
<br>
Blizzard's post about Fury damage in 2.3 was irritatingly vague. They claimed they saw a "significant damage increase" but didn't specify context. Do they mean more damage to bosses? Higher overall damage meter standing because Fury warriors can spam Sweeping Whirlwind/Cleave on trash pulls and pad their meter position? Farming?</div>

		<div id="post_message_542189">I've been playing with the dps warrior spreadsheet, and assuming they make the 6 expertise from defiance work in berserker stance, the dps loss for picking up the prot talents seems to be all but negligible.<br>
<br>
With my t4/t5/s2 level fury gear, and typical raid buffs for me, I got the following dps numbers:<br>
<br>
No impale/anger management, no 6 expertise from defiance:<br>
1260.6<br>
<br>
With impale/anger management:<br>
1304.7<br>
<br>
With +6 expertise and no impale/anger management:<br>
1276.5<br>
<br>
So I'm looking at a 1-(1276.5/1304.7) = 2.2% decrease in dps compared to an optimal spec, to get defiance's threat for tanking, last stand, and imp shield block to become uncrushable if you have to tank anything higher level. Finally, no deep wounds eating a debuff slot.<br>
<br>
Disadvantages: No imp tclap, no +5% parry.</div>

				</div>
				<div style="font-style:italic">Unless it's a fight where you're looking at going from threat capped to generating far less threat with the change to Improved Berserker stance, there is absolutely no way this is true. The ability to leverage Death Wish + Execute + Haste Pot and maybe even a Heroism is what kept Fury dps competitive. No DW Executes is going to be a huge blow. I know that personally when I was Fury, at 19% if I popped a haste pot + Bloodlust Brooch + DW + Recklessness, I'd be pulling something on the order of 2500-3000 DPS for a short period, and this is going to nerf 500+ of that DPS for the duration of Death Wish.<br>
<br>
Edit: To try and make this thought more concrete, some simple math for it. Assuming 500 lost DPS for the execute range Death Wish, 500 DPS x 30 seconds = 15,000 damage lost. Assuming an average length fight, you'd probably use Death Wish one other time before Executes, so maybe that one only loses you something in the range of 10,000 damage, to be conservative. So 25,000 damage lost to Death Wish going away. Assuming 1600 DPS total for the fight, and a 5 minute fight, 2% Dodge being removed is worth around 32 DPS. So 32 DPS x 300 seconds is 9600 damage. Assuming 5 Whirlwinds a minute, you're looking at 25 whirlwinds over a 5 minute fight, so you'd have to do 10,400 damage with 25 offhand hits, or 416 damage average hits with your offhand with WW to equal out the DW loss according to my quick napkin math, I guess. I suppose that puts things closer than I had expected.</div>

</div>Yeah, but I was trying to do a more general case than for a human specifically. Plus, the human racial changing has nothing to do with the talent changes, it's a boost either way. I mean, obviously it means that as a human Fury warrior you're going to gain that damage (at the cost of the 3% hit, still obviously a gain), but it doesn't do much for the specific comparison of the talent changes.</div>

		<div id="post_message_542582">I'm thinking of switching to a warrior for raiding. I have a 64 Tauren and could get my brothers 60 Orc (same last name). <br>
<br>
My raid roll would be DPS/Offtanking. So here are my questions for the experts:<br>
<br>
<br>
1. Is bloodfury enough of a dps increase (and safe enough) to use in a majority of boss encounters. <br>
2. Are the end game axes on par with the other end game weapons for the expertise bonus?<br>
3. Would the DPS game from the expertise cancel out using a non-optimal weapon? <br>
4. Do you get the racial bonus if you use the weapon in your off hand? <br>
<br>
My assumptions are that blood fury is 282 * 15/120 ap is you use it every cool down. I also am assuming that expertise will give you ~1.2% increase to dps. <br>
<br>
I was planning on going hammer smith or ax smith to craft a weapon, so I should be using a crafted main hand until T6 level content. Seems like it's a choice of locking into axes for a marginal amount of dps (when using axes) and threat generation (with axes) at the expense of losing the hp bonus for tanking.</div>

</div>I find myself using it less than I suppose I could be.  There are plenty of gamble times where you aren't getting hit by anything, but at any moment you could be.  This is the main reason I can't find a use for it in Hyjal or BT yet.  Actually, it would probably be really useful on Gurtogg during the Fel-Rage stages when you have enough time for Bloodfury to last the entire duration and you shouldn't be taking any kind of damage.  Supremus is another fight that it would be fine on as long as you don't accidentally let any of the flames hit you.   I still think the fights where you cannot use this ability far outweigh the fights where you can, but the potential is still there.  For SSC/TK the only fight I can think of it being ok to cut your healing by 50% when you actually need it would be something like Lurker and Leotheras.  If you are DPS on Al'ar you could probably use it as well as long as you avoid every flame patch.<br>

As for axes, i use the Wicked Edge and the S2 offhand.

I keep my Vashj dagger for my aggro-def equip but otherwise I'll use my two talons(phoenix/aszhara) from now on. <br>
It's sad though that fast weapons will now be ignored by most warrior raiders if the overall dps stats can't outweigh their current setup.<br>

</div>I never saw what was so good about Imp Execute. Its nice, but it only applies 20% of the time, and during that time hardly noticeable once you have the gear to get 15 rage/GCD. It would be the first thing I drop to get 2% less dodge, which also applies to executes.</div>

</div>It's not necessarily a bad stat, but it's just not the same for rogues and warriors. Crit does a number of things for warriors: activates flurry and rampage, applies Deep Wounds, and double rage gain on a white crit. It's not as efficient as hit rating for white damage, but hit rating also doesn't affect Flurry or yellow damage. Warriors don't have a mechanic like Combat Potency, where white hits yield more energy for yellow damage. <br>
<br>
Point for point, the gain is generally better off in other places once the yellow damage hit cap is reached.</div>

</div>What do you mean by "efficient rage generation"? Enough rage to keep up a 3BT/2WW cycle? Enough rage to be able to make one exec/gcd? The first condition is fulfilled easily already in pre-raid gear (when fully buffed), the second is a bit harder to achieve.<br>
<br>
All stats that increase white dps will give you more rage (str,agi,crit,haste,hit, expertise,-armor), there is no particular "need" for a certain amount of hit or expertise. Some stats give more rage increase than others though (not quite the same as the best ones for damage), and this can change with gear level. I suggest you download and play with the DPS warrior spreadsheet (that you can find in another thread here), it will calculate your rage generation and model the resulting dps from both white and yellow damage (including execute phase).</div>

</div>I'm not trying to be a jerk, but considering the weapons you have, are you sure your personal experience is the best for such a generalization?  The point about as your gear improves, overall rage and yellow damage increases makes sense sure, but that seems to be good advice for the long term for most people, not the average currently geared DPS Warriors.  I also don't know how fast you are attacking most of the time, but it's a pretty safe bet to say that you are generating a hell of a lot more rage than an average TK+++ Warrior.  Currently *my* white DPS is always between 43% - 50% for a full raid night.<br>
<br>
I will probably just try both 1/3 Precision as well as 3/3 in the end though to see what gives me better results for the short term.  The spreadsheet shows it being an extremely minimal difference, and while bosses are "what counts", with our new "improved DPS" I'd like to actually try and take advantage of our Mage-in-plate ability with SS whenever possible.</div>

		<div id="post_message_547086">I have dps'd as protection spec on certain fights where we didn't min/max the raid and was surprised at how well it did.  I was able to put out a little over 700 dps without windfury (I had LoTP and a BM hunter) on the Lurker Below using my dual wield fury gear.  I have also been spec'd 17/44 for the same fight (although without a few gear upgrades) and finished at just about 1000dps (with windfury).<br>
<br>
Based on my experiences, and seeing the new changes to rage for devastate and hitting with both weapons for whirlwind, I think the gap between fury and protection dps is shrinking even more.  I modified the warrior dps spreadsheet to use a 6 devastate + 1 WW rotation and found that the theoretical dps difference between 17/44 and 17/3/41 (emphasis on dps talents) is only 10-15%.  My gear in protection spec includes about 10% hit, 35% crit, and 2900 AP raid buffed with a pair of 97 dps weapons (2.7/2.6 speed).  The theoretical dps on the spreadsheet was 1200 dps for 17/3/41 and 1350 dps for 17/44.<br>
<br>
Obviously a fury warrior still does more dps, but if you end up tanking anything (or being one of 2 tanks in a ZA raid) you really have to wonder if it would be better to just be protection spec'd.<br>
<br>
I have definitely decided that it is either 17/44 or 17/3/41 for me.  Even losing just 3 points to pick up the new tactical mastery makes the dps gap close enough that it isn't worth it.</div>

</div>Here are my exact numbers for different setups with what I consider decent gear (10% hit, 2900 AP, 35% crit, Wicked Edge + S2 slow axe -- this would be the prot stats, add another 600 or so AP for a full fury setup with commanding presence/rampage/imp zerk):<br>
<br>
17/3/41 (full prot, 1/3 imp shield, impale, 5/5 vit, 5/5 1h spec) - 1177DPS<br>
** 0/20/41 (full prot same as above but sacrificing all arms for 5/5 dual wield) - 1232DPS<br>
5/41/15 (1/3 precision, 5/5 dw spec, 2/2 weap mast, 0/2 imp execute) - 1278DPS<br>
0/46/15 (everything you need for dps in fury) - 1306DPS<br>
17/41/3 (0/3 precision) - 1315DPS<br>
17/44 (all but 0/2 imp execute) - 1355DPS<br>
<br>
** - this build is impractical because you lose 5/5 parry and 3/3 imp TC as a protection spec<br>
<br>
Also keep in mind that deep wounds is not modeled in the spreadsheet.  That is usually around 3% of my dps so you can safely add ~30dps to specs that have it.<br>
<br>
The problem with the 5/41/15 spec is that you do maybe 80DPS (roughly 7%) more than a 17/3/41 protection spec and you still can't MT any fights and still have a rough time OT a lot of fights.  Is that small boost worth it?  I don't know for others, but for me it probably isn't (I tank probably 60-70% of the time and right now that often means respeccing because not having improved shield block/shield slam threat is a no go, whereas when I DPS the other 30-40% of the time a loss of 10% of my dps is not going to cost the fight).</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">People should also consider that with out Death Wish, Imp execute isn't going to see the return it once did after 20%.  If you can generate 15 rage every 1.5 seconds, which shouldn't be hard to do IMO, you should still be able to spam execute.  Further Your white attacks Not missing will insure that you DO have the rage to execute every 1.5 seconds.  In short, taking an over all dps loss for imp execute is not worth it IMO.</div>

</div>I fail to see how dropping 2 points in Precision for 2 points in Weapon Mastery (2% hit for -2% dodge) will be an overall DPS loss.  Unless you're already floating at only 9-10.99% hit with 3/3 Precision, dropping trading 2% hit for -2% dodge should be an overall DPS increase.  While you gain 2% miss from your white attacks, you lose 2% dodge from them, which are for all intents and purposes the exact same thing.  However, those 2 points in Precision are completely meaningless for your yellow attacks (which make up 50-65% of your total damage, depending on your gear and the fight), unless you are so low on hit that going 1/3 Precision will take you below the specials cap; whereas, the 2% dodge actually affects your yellow damage past the special hit cap.<br>
<br>
Basically, you're trading 2% hit for -2% dodge on whites, effectively the same thing, and gaining -2% dodge on your yellows, for an overall DPS increase.</div>

		<div id="post_message_547426">The arguments for 5/41/15 from an offtanking standpoint is:<br>
- 3/3 precision for 3% fewer taunt resists (presuming tank gear not hit capped otherwise).<br>
- precision + weapon mastery + defiance's expertise for strong secondary threat building without incoming rage from damage recieved.<br>
- threat reduction (and less AoE damage taken?) from imp zerker stance for threat sensitive fights while purely DPSing.<br>
- 1/3 imp shield block for similar crushing avoidance as full prot (albeit squishier than deep prot on many other counts).<br>
- Last stand always handy for short-duration "oh crap I'm tanking!" OT moments.<br>
<br>
Relative to the ~3% damage boost you get from 17/41/3 (vs. 5/41/15), the extra 12 points in prot seem well spent. 17/44 is a 6% gain over 5/41/15, but loses a lot of OT utility without at least tactical mastery.<br>
<br>
I'm looking at the hybrid build for a pre-raid geared alt for tanking heroics and OT'ing Kara/ZA. Given the incoming damage of T5/T6 opponents on OTs, 17/3/41 certainly seems like a top choice for raiding OTs due to all the extra survivability goodies.</div>

<br>
While the majority of our damage is from specials, it is the white damage that we do that fuels our ability to do those specials.  The more we miss, the less rage we have to spend on yellow attacks.  That is why we see a dps loss when we take the points from precision and leave the points in IMP execute.  If you are not rage starved at all, then by all means drop the points in precision. IF you are barely covering your move rotations it does not seem like a very good move IMO</div>

		<div id="post_message_548106">I'm in a guild currently raiding BT, and in all honesty, being one of the prot warriors, (ot'ing mainly) it's quite frustrating being 'useless' (as we can't really dps) in most encounters, with the exception of gurtogg, supremus and maybe azgalor. With the introduction of increased threat for MS/BT in this patch, i'm thinking about speccing something like 0/41/20 or 5/41/15 to give it a shot and see if it's a viable raiding spec for high end at all. Even if this increase in threat for bloodthirst will not make it anywhere as good as SS, i wonder if this change in tactical mastery can 'balance it out', if you will, and make it possible to keep up with the threat on encounters like gurtogg and at the same time making it possible to mitigate enough damage to hold it. In a way, do you think the new tactical mastery, defiance and weapon mastery can make us the new 'feral druids'? <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302181244im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":)" class="inlineimg"></div>

Our guild ran SSC tonight to attune a couple resto shamans, and I really can't rate the DPS change, since it's been so long since we did SSC that my gear's changed dramatically and I just don't remember what I normally did on a certain boss.  <br>
<br>
To me, it felt really lackluster.  For instance, I really felt that I could have put out another 100 DPS or more on Morogrim (the only real tank and spank in the instance, I wasn't in for Lurker) if I had had Death Wish coupled with Haste Pots, Drums and Heroism, as opposed to those without Death Wish.  Sure, whirlwind was nice and jumped up a couple percent of my total damage, and I was getting 0-4% dodge on my attacks, but I really don't think it made up for it.<br>

So, does anybody have any "I did this on x last week and did this on x this week and here's the difference" WWS reports yet?</div>

I normally have an Enh Shaman in my group, but didn't for either Rage or Anetheron.  I felt like I was doing substantially less DPS, but checked the WWS and was probably around 50-100 dps less than I normally would've been.  Part of that is the lack of WF and Bloodlust, but all in all I'm going to have to get back into a new groove.  The server crashed in the 1st wave of Kaz'Rogal so we quit there.<br>

We had an Executioneer Pattern drop horde side tonight, but I'm going to wait for some numbers before I reenchant my Rising Tide ...since I enchanted it with Mongoose last week &gt;_&gt; haha.<br>

I will say with trash in Hyjal my DPS was significantly higher as SS/WW/Cleave combo was putting up some gaudy numbers.  I fear however that Blizzard knew this would happen and would only use this to try and appease the ones that really see our single target DPS suffer with "Well, you are doing more damage when it doesn't really matter, eh?"</div>

</div>I've been curious about the protection tree's damage potential since the first time I got a hold of this nifty warrrior dps spreadsheet and so I was encouraged to modify it for myself and here's the result.<br>

<br>
Can't guarantee values are 100% correct but they do match the values I saw when testing 17/44/0 and 11/5/44 respectively. A bonus for the 5-man group on the side of devastate dps is the sunder debuff when using a paladin or druid as tank, which would prbably make protection dps just as vialble as fury (if you disregard potential aggro issues).</div>

		<div id="post_message_548255">Hey guys, I was thinking to switch to a pure 2h Fury build. I am 33/28 atm.<br>
Reasons for thinking about fury atm are two things:<br>
I still use gorehowl as weapon and think that my bloodthirst with my equip (SSC/TK/Hyjal/BT, AP is raidbuffed a bit over 3100 with 33/28) will be higher than the MS with Gorehowl. Second I really like the new imp Bersi stance with the aggroreduce.<br>
Rigth now I`m not quite sure where iI should put my last point e.g. do I skill 20/41 or 21/40<br>
<br>
Pros 20/41: I think more overall dmg<br>
Cons: Like describe some posts above keeping rampage up could be a pain in the ass, because you only have one chance to use it every 24 seconds if you want to keep your cycle.<br>
<br>
Pros 21/40: with deathwish you can trigger 20% dmg more for 30 seconds when needed because of a bossphase where its all about pure dps. and the phase must be over quick again.<br>
You get an additional fearward with Deathwish. If needed you can put points into hit, so you can use other equip.<br>
Cons: Overall a little bit less dmg, but I think that you migth loose some dmg because you have to use rampage out of your slam cycle. And that leads to a broken slam cycle and to weaker dmg.</div>

</div>It appears that there is no warrior applying Sunder Armor.  You'll need to incorporate it into your cycles if you want to maximize DPS.  Additionally, since you're speccing 5/5 demo shout, you should request a warlock apply Curse of Recklessness.  Your tank will not be taking any extra damage so long as your Demo Shout is up at all times.  I just use Quartz's built-in debuff timers for watching that sort of thing, though the Blizz auras will work fine since you're the only one refreshing them.  That one change should have a massive effect on Hunter, Rogue and Warrior DPS.</div>

Also did Imp Berserker Stance at one point on test have the increased damage taken in Berserker stance lifted?  I could have sworn I read accounts of that.  Because it definitely does not do that on live.<br>

They need to make some positive changes to Fury or the spec really has no role going forward, long term.  As of right now if you are building a raid or a guild from the ground up, why would you indulge a Fury Warrior?

				They need to make some positive changes to Fury or the spec really has no role going forward, long term. As of right now if you are building a raid or a guild from the ground up, why would you indulge a Fury Warrior? What does he bring over Arms besides a little bit more personal DPS that is easily offset by the Bloodfrenzy debuff?

</div>I've been struggling with this too. The only reason I ever get into a raid is because I off-tank a lot. I'm also the raid leader...so that helps too.<br>
<br>
More and more I'm tempted to spec MS and just go with it. Blood Frenzy, Death wish and far better PvP viability all in 1 go. It's getting harder to pass up.<br>
<br>
Okay, now for my observations last night in our SSC clear. (Our guild has killed Kael and Rage once if you care about our progression level). I'm also pretty insanely gear by our guild's standards...having virtually every drop from SSC/TK and PvP item i could ever want.<br>
<br>
Boss dps; Don't have a WWS posted yet, and i had to off-tank Hydross so... <br>
<br>
Lurker, seemed like less then normal due to the whole single target no DW aspect. <br>
<br>
Leo should have been equal or better on first thought due to agro reduction, but i think i was significantly less because of timed haste pot/DW on demon phase. Plus the paladins forgot to give me salv, and i didn't notice until like 12%.<br>
<br>
Fathom Lord; I actually got to DPS him tonight for only the second time in 4 months, and i was first on DPS until we got to Fathom Lord himself. SS/Cleave/Whirlwind really rips up the DPS meter when you are attacking totems/add and pet/add. Single targeting Priest and Fathom Lord himself saw me drop to second place behind our top rogue. Didn't use my bulwark armor buff and recklessness though.<br>
<br>
Tidewalker; I was actually lower on the DPS meter then usual, but i think i managed more DPS. Had our fastest kill ever on him last night so a lot of people stepped it up. Probably my highest personal dps on him ever...but again, SS/Cleave/WW on the murlocs = ROFL dps.<br>
<br>
Vashj; Less then usual, no doubt in my mind. I usually cover a quadrant, and while the new WW is super nice and improves it's rage efficiency HUGELY, I occasionally popped DW to catch up on elementals if i had a bad miss streak or had to squish a tainted....the loss of that option just had me praying for lots of crits and no misses.<br>
<br>
Trash; Probably slightly better. When i could coax the tanks to put 2 mobs side by side i would tear it up...but the opportunities for that are few and far between.<br>
<br>
Overall? I'll adapt as usual....but I'm missing DW, that's for sure. Probably a slight loss to boss dps (2-5%) and a nice gain on multi-mob/boss add fights. I kind of had to laugh when I was describing the changes to others in the guild and said that I'm basically an "AoE specced Warrior" now.<br>
<br>
OH! I managed to get an executioner enchant on my main-hand last night, so I'll test that out in TK tonight and see how it goes...I expect a better then usual showing on VR and Solarian, and worse then usual on KT.</div>

I was too far away from the healers so it was a pretty sweet death so I really can't speak for my Arch numbers.  <br>
At Teron Gorefiend there was a server crash at 9% so we called it a night.  It looks like I'm doing noticeably less damage, but then again I was fresh out of haste potions as well.  Last night's Teron 9% had me at 1648 dps according to WWS, and last week I did 1750.  Recently we've only had 2 paladins per raid so I don't get BoM these days, and lack of bears means no LotP.<br>

		<div id="post_message_548523">Hey guys, with the new patch, i still have some question about what weapon to use as a fury.<br>
<br>
I do understand that with the new WW, having a slow OH might up our dps, but it also mean that we wont have a " quick fix rage incoming" as we used to have with a fast OH.<br>
<br>
Well anyway here is my question.<br>
I do have a few weapons and i would like your advice as wich combo i should use.<br>
- Swiftsteel Bludgeon (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304064628/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=32943" target="_blank">Swiftsteel Bludgeon - Items - World of Warcraft</a>)<br>

Anyway, if they barely differ from eachother, I'd still go with the fast one for, as you say, smoother rage generation.

</div>Apparently they added a quartz like function to the game with this patch, and when you press a move it adds it to the que and intiates a global cool down.  I have HS bound to the same key as my Blood Thirst and much to my suprise I saw my blood thirst go back on cool down imediately performing the move even thought I didn't press the button just then.  It's wierd because I am used to jumping between my 1 &amp; 2 buttons (BT/HS and WW) but my blood thirst just kept comming up and going back on cool down faster than my move timer would have predicted.    Anyway, It was diffrent so it threw me off last night.  I am getting more used to it now though.<br>

</div>Actually, from the post "how does flurry work” It didn't appear that weapon speed made a difference in how flurry actually performs, so I am not sure I agree with that statement.  Perhaps if you quantified what you mean by efficient use of Flurry I could respond better.<br>
<br>
Futher, As long as the weapons you use are not daggers, the loss of whirlwind damage due to weapon top end should be more than made up for in over all dps.  I do not subscribe to using lower DPS weapons just because they may have a higher top end theory.  My personal Theory is that the reason WW is so much lower is because BT is on a 6 cool down while WW is on a 9. As your attack power gets higher, your BT damage will just be better.  For example, let’s assume 3500 ATP which is more than reasonable.  Every 6 seconds you will hit for 1575 with your blood thirst or 4725 damage every 18 seconds.  You whirlwind hits with both weapons lets take myself for 600 MH 450 OH or 2100 damage every 18 seconds.  There should be no way that your WW damage should even equate to more than 50% of whatever your BT damage with raid buffed ATP as ATP should always stay ahead of weapon damage by a significant amount.  My personal numbers support this.  I could be horribly horribly wrong and if so, I would love to be corrected.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Hi, I am currently specced 17/44/0 and starting SSC/TK.  My dps is around 650ish most times which i feel is not performing to what i would expect.  I use BT and WW everytime it is up and try to incorporate HS whenever possible.  I would appreciate some pointers from the more experienced guys?  This is the latest WWS.<br>

		<div id="post_message_549525">I have mixed feelings about the recent patch changes.  On one hand I hate losing Deathwish, not only the potential DPS loss but the fact that I could choose when to do burst damage, and could pair it with a DPS trinket or Fetish of the Sandreaver if I wanted to.  On the other side, the new SS is pretty much awesome and my DPS doesn't seem to have gone down.<br>

I'm (Amelio) in a group with other DPS Warriors and no Shaman.  The Enhancement Shaman, BM Hunter, and Rogue are in the MT group with a Feral Druid and Prot Warrior running Battle Shout, so pretty stacked group for them.<br>

I'm in a group with Enhancement Shaman, so my DPS is slightly higher overall.  Only 80 DPS difference which could be easily attributed to having totems with me.  (EDIT: Also was offhanding Mericless 1.4 spd dagger instead of Rod of the Sun King.)<br>

I'm with Enhancement Shaman and Feral Druid.  My DPS spiked as high as 1800 when I popped SS on the adds.<br>
<br>
Pre-2.3: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304064628/http://wowwebstats.com/4ytok26bo6brk?s=7880-8138" target="_blank">Wow Web Stats</a><br>
I'm with Enhancement Shaman and Feral Druid again, so same group makeup.  A huge 300 DPS less, potentially the new SS is a big part of this, but I lost Deathwish during Heroism, so I'm not sure. (EDIT: Also was offhanding Mericless 1.4 spd dagger instead of Rod of the Sun King.)<br>
<br>
At the very least, I don't see that Fury Warriors were hurt all that much, if at all.  Our role has changed slightly, but I don't see why a guild would want us any less.  I do have to admit we run a strange setup with 4 DPS warriors and only 1 Rogue currently, with 2 Feral Druids who like to tank most fights.  In guilds that run with only a few Warriors, a couple Prot and one MS for Blood Frenzy, I could see where a Rogue would be more appealing than more Warriors.  I say you go with what you got, if you have exceptional Warriors, no reason to try to replace them.<br>
<br>
<br>
I do have a question about hit rating.  It's generally considered that once you have 9-10% hit from gear it's not necessarily that great to stack more at the expense of other stats.  Now what if you are mainhanding Dragonstrike and offhanding Rod of the Sun King.... would it be worth it to stack hit heavily for the sake of the Sun King proc?  Would Sun King be better mainhand than Dragonstrike?  I don't believe the DPS spreadsheets handle this proc, feel free to correct me if I'm wrong.</div>

As to flurry, I think the "how does flurry work"-thread is quite empty of any hard evidence for slow vs fast, that thread is mainly concerned with the extra flurried attacks you can get by having matched weapon speeds. It is quite clear that slow weapons will give higher flurry uptimes due to having more time to do instants while flurry is up, but it is a quite small effect (about 5% in flurry uptime for a 1.6 vs a 2.6 MH, slightly more for fast/fast setups). Faster weapons will apply flurry faster though (if you lose the buff in a non-crit streak). Caesar modeled it in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302201553/http://elitistjerks.com/534787-post162.html" target="_blank">http://elitistjerks.com/534787-post162.html</a>, I think his calculations are correct.<br>
<br>
I'm guessing that Nezralix means that the damage from HS is partly from the white hit and partly from the added damage. However, since pressing HS also makes the swing yellow, I would also report the total damage from HS in the way you have done (making it impossible to find the "true" added damage from HS from a combat log, it can be modeled however). Guess it depends on what you're trying to show.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Actually, from the post "how does flurry work” It didn't appear that weapon speed made a difference in how flurry actually performs, so I am not sure I agree with that statement.  Perhaps if you quantified what you mean by efficient use of Flurry I could respond better.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</div>All of the Flurry mechanics posts I've seen have basically been a large number of people saying "I think Flurry works like this, but I'm not really sure". Intuitively, I can say that knowing that yellow damage procs Flurry means that I'd rather those Flurry charges get used on my main hand than my off hand. A fast off-hand means that I'm rather likely to expend more charges on that than on my main hand, even if I do get slightly more Flurry procs as a result of a faster off-hand. Again, this is largely intuitive, so I could be mistaken, but if it functions like it seems like it should does, then I think I'm right. <br>

				Futher, As long as the weapons you use are not daggers, the loss of whirlwind damage due to weapon top end should be more than made up for in over all dps.  I do not subscribe to using lower DPS weapons just because they may have a higher top end theory.  My personal Theory is that the reason WW is so much lower is because BT is on a 6 cool down while WW is on a 9. As your attack power gets higher, your BT damage will just be better.  For example, let’s assume 3500 ATP which is more than reasonable.  Every 6 seconds you will hit for 1575 with your blood thirst or 4725 damage every 18 seconds.  You whirlwind hits with both weapons lets take myself for 600 MH 450 OH or 2100 damage every 18 seconds.  There should be no way that your WW damage should even equate to more than 50% of whatever your BT damage with raid buffed ATP as ATP should always stay ahead of weapon damage by a significant amount.  My personal numbers support this.  I could be horribly horribly wrong and if so, I would love to be corrected.
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</div>Your math is a bit imprecise. Yes, Bloodthirst would hit for 1575 pre-armor. But your whirlwind should hit for way more than that. Let's assume a 100 dps weapon like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302201553/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=32236" target="_blank">Rising Tide</a> (260 average damage). With 3500 attack power, you're hitting for (3500/14)*2.4 + 260 = 860. Multiply by 1.625 for equivalent off-hand damage, and you're looking at a 1398 hit. 1186 for a weapon with half that average damage, so 18% more damage with the slower weapons. Not insignificant, and even a larger difference if you have less attack power. In either case it's really pretty comparable to Bloodthirst damage, and has the slight advantage of giving you two opportunities to proc Flurry, and using a bit less rage. <br>
<br>
<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px; ">
	<div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom:0px"><img src="/web/20080302201553im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/chestnut/misc/citation.gif" border="0"></div>

				Finally, if my tracker says that 19% of my damage is from heroic strike, how can you do anything but assume that 19% of my damage is from heroic strike?  Is there something I am not accounting for?
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</div>Your Heroic Strikes may be accounting for that damage, but all of it isn't caused by the Heroic Strike skill damage. Most of that damage (at least 75% of it) would have been done by the white damage it added onto. So if it accounts for 19% of your damage, with the 75% figure then the skill damage itself is only accounting for 19*0.25 = 4.75% of your total damage, and you might as well add 14.25% to your white damage. Although in practice it's slightly more damage just on account of removing crushing blows and some misses.<br>
<br>
EDIT: Just to reiterate something I posted earlier, the new WW gets (AP/14)*2.4*1.625 = AP*0.278 contribution from attack power, or 28%. Just from attack power. So even with a 0-1 damage range weapon, it will be doing 61% of Bloodthirst's damage. Obviously, a powerful pair of weapons adds significantly to it.</div>

				The change from Imp Execute to Precision will gain me about 3 DPS according to the spreadsheet. From my experience, the last 20% on a boss can be the most crucial due to enrages, mass damage, hectic environments, et al (Vashj, Leo, KT, Morogrim, plenty of examples - not sure about MH/BT since my guild just killed KT this week).

<br>
And on the fast OH vs slow OH subject, because of the WW change, it might be optimal to use a mid range weapon somewhere 1.8-2.4 speed. You get a more steady rage income than using a slow OH but still get more dmg out of your WW's.<br>
<br>
Another question. according to this hit table:<br>
<br>
0-28: Miss<br>
28-33.6: Dodge<br>
33.6-58.6: Glancing<br>
58.6-78.6: Crit<br>
78.6-100: Hit<br>
<br>
there is a 5.6% (33.6-28) chance for a mob to dodge correct? so in order to push all dodges out of the hit table you would need -5.6% chance to dodge from expertise? which at -0.25%/ expertise (cant remember where i saw that figure, but i remember seeing it somewhere) would be 22.4*3.9(number of expertise rating per expertise) = 87.36  expertise rating right?<br>
<br>
87 expertise can be obtained by using:<br>

One is my reason stated above, and secondly, with the gear from heroics now available with huge amounts of hit and with the change to whirlwind it should be no problem getting hit up with one or two of these pieces and enjoying a shorter cooldown on a buffed ability.  If you're really short on hit, then swap the points from imp whirlwind into precision.  But people are really overestimating precision, imo.</div>

</div>Because 1/2 in Improved Whirlwind is only good if you calculate with zero latency.<br>
Once you bump the latency to 150ms, 2/2 suddenly seems a little more interesting. In theory of course.<br>

</div>Sleep is huge though, 5 more of them and you lose 40s of DPS time?  Kaz'rogal (as a Tauren that can out range the stun anyway) and Gorefiend are the good benchmark fights IMO.<br>

As for spec post 2.3...I go 3/5 Booming Voice and 2/5 Demo still.  Unbridled Wrath is so underwhelming when you can get about the same Rage from 1 point in Anger Management.</div>

</div>Originally 2/2 Improved Whirlwind was frowned upon because it didn't sync with the GCD, and thus often you would miss out on the extra second added by your second point.<br>
<br>
Fast forward to the patch where Windfury was changed so that it no longer procs from instant attacks: hamstring is removed from warrior DPS cycles, thus the only abilities you have that use the GCD are Bloodthirst and Whirlwind. Now most of the time the bonus second of cooldown is used (sometimes Bloodthirst and Whirlwind cooldowns overlap), but on the whole this is considered to be a relatively worse point investment compared to Improved Execute.<br>
<br>
Now, in patch 2.3, we have begun to realize that Execute isn't as good as it used to be, and given that Whirlwind has been buffed 62.5%, improved Whirlwind is actually a sound talent investment.</div>

</div>I think your gut is wrong.<br>
<br>
250 AP is 250/14 = 17.9 paper DPS. Assuming a 10% miss rate and 10% crit rate basically cancel out, and armor reduction is 30%, then that's 17.9*0.7*1.45 = 18.2 TPS, over the 30 seconds it lasts is 18.2*30 = 545 threat. Not including factors like Flurry, or using Bloodthirst as a threat skill (which should be possible now with Tactical Mastery). So it's at least comparable to Sunder for the time it's active.</div>

What's the average possible threat increase of 250 AP for 30 seconds vs. the maximum threat possible for using one other GCD with a 0/46/15 spec? I'm not familiar with the new threat values for BT with the new TM so I've got no idea here but our options are, Revenge, BT and Sunder.<br>
<br>

<br>
What's the average possible threat increase of 250 AP for 30 seconds vs. the most efficient threat generating skill using one GCD in that 0/46/15 spec? I'm assuming that, all threat generating skills being untalented, Revenge would be the top skill to use here for threat per rage (again I'm not familiar with the numbers on the new TM modified BT). So would the threat increase on Rampage costing 20 rage, lasting 30 seconds be more efficient than another skill (assumably Revenge)?<br>
<br>
edit: Oops posted before Nezralix, he seems to be on the case and already mostly answered the question. Does anyone know the exact threat value for BT with TM?</div>

		<div id="post_message_550734">Sorry for the long delay in post time, work gets in the way of wow sometimes.  Anyway, I think we are having a good discussion, and here are some things I would like to add.<br>
<br>
[quote=Nezralix;549548]All of the Flurry mechanics posts I've seen have basically been a large number of people saying "I think Flurry works like this, but I'm not really sure". Intuitively, I can say that knowing that yellow damage procs Flurry means that I'd rather those Flurry charges get used on my main hand than my off hand. A fast off-hand means that I'm rather likely to expend more charges on that than on my main hand, even if I do get slightly more Flurry procs as a result of a faster off-hand. Again, this is largely intuitive, so I could be mistaken, but if it functions like it seems like it should does, then I think I'm right. <br>
<br>
I think my main point about brining up the "how does flurry work" post is that I at this point I am not sure we understand enough about flurry mechanics to make concrete claims one way or the other regarding things like how weapon speed effects the skill.  What we can say is that Flurry makes you attack faster.  Now I think this is where we diverge on why we see this as important.  You seem to be coming from the point of view that my MH getting flurry swings instead of my off hand is better since I then get full damage from it.  This is true.  My view point is this however, attacking faster means that I generate more rage.  More rage means more specials.  More specials mean more damage.  If the majority of our damage were white, I would agree with your stance about weapons.  However, in my opinion, the white damage you do is gravy.  As your gear gets better you should see your white damage continue to decrease over time as your rage bar takes few hits to fill up.  I think this is born out by the WWS reports of higher geared warriors.  This is why I say that dps on a weapon is far more important than the top end because the rage generation formula factors in weapon dps I believe.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
[quote=Nezralix;549548]Your math is a bit imprecise. Yes, Bloodthirst would hit for 1575 pre-armor. But your whirlwind should hit for way more than that. Let's assume a 100 dps weapon like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304041653/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=32236" target="_blank">Rising Tide</a> (260 average damage). With 3500 attack power, you're hitting for (3500/14)*2.4 + 260 = 860. Multiply by 1.625 for equivalent off-hand damage and you're looking at a 1398 hit. 1186 for a weapon with half that average damage, so 18% more damage with the slower weapons. Not insignificant, and even a larger difference if you have less attack power. In either case it's really pretty comparable to Bloodthirst damage, and has the slight advantage of giving you two opportunities to proc Flurry, and using a bit less rage. <br>
<br>
Two things here.  First it seems to be true that your off hand is not currently procing Flurry.  I have not confirmed this, but that is something to consider.  But you should also consider that since WW is two attacks is suffers from all of the bad out comes of the table twice.  BT will always pull ahead simply because it's one chunk of damage with one set of possible out comes. I have never argued that the return for WW dps by using a slow off hand is insignificant.  What I am saying is that in terms of your over all damage it is not worth choosing a lesser dps weapon just for the ww increase.<br>
<br>
<br>
[quote=Nezralix;549548]Your Heroic Strikes may be accounting for that damage, but all of it isn't caused by the Heroic Strike skill damage. Most of that damage (at least 75% of it) would have been done by the white damage it added onto. So if it accounts for 19% of your damage, with the 75% figure then the skill damage itself is only accounting for 19*0.25 = 4.75% of your total damage, and you might as well add 14.25% to your white damage. Although in practice it's slightly more damage just on account of removing crushing blows and some misses.<br>
<br>
I think that your principle does not bear out here.  If this were true, you would have to calculate WW the same way seeing as it is completely based upon white damage that you would do.  What is important here is that HS is a next swing attack and a yellow attack.  This means a few things.  First, that because it's yellow it is not subject to Glancing blows nor the usual miss rates for white attacks.  Second, it benefits greatly from haste and increased weapon speed unlike our other yellow attacks.  Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, because it's next swing, it can proc WF.  No other special that we have can do this.  Oh and in illumination of a previous point, this means that HS gets better and better with faster weapons.<br>
<br>
To conclude, I would say that while the WW change is nice, it is not significant enough to build around.  The biggest increase to our single target dps will be the advent of Expertise and 10% less agro in zerker  in my opinion.   Further, the goal should be to use WW and BT every time they are up AND fill in as many HS as possible because heroic strike right now is simply amazing.</div>

		<div id="post_message_550936">Alright i have a couple questions regarding 2.3<br>
<br>
I did some testing last night in ssc. Yes we do lose dps overall on straight dps on bosses but we gain some +'s to trash killing and aoe type packs. but heres what i want to get down to.<br>
<br>
I currently use decpitator 92.1 dps and Gladiator's Quickblade. crappy weapons i know but as soon as season 3 hits im curious as to what i should get. Im for sure getting the 1h Mace for MH but im debating wether or not to get 2 1h Maces or get the OH mace. im looking for overall boss dps here and not trash dps. im running roughly 200 hit rating 1850 AP and 31% crit unbuffed in zerker. problem is i came accross a few times where i would be short on rage on morogrim last night. i did not have a feral druid or a shaman in the group. i had hunters with drums and FI and i hit 900 dps on that fight. is this low or about average? you can check my armory for gear wise.<br>
<br>
What is better after 2.3 2 2.7 speed 1h maces at 103.1 dps or 1 2.7 speed 1h mace and a 1.5 speed 103.1 dps OH. im leading to believe that due to my lack of rage at times during the fight could lead that i was low on crit. i did have sharpening stones and was at about 34% raid buffed. so im either thinking i need a harder hitting OH or more crit.<br>
<br>
Also Executioner, what do you guys think of this? any feedback on tests? Im thinking of running Mongoose/executioner or just stick to mongoose/+20 str<br>
<br>
Lode did you do the testing yet on Executioner?</div>

Maybe I was just a horrible Fury Warrior before and I also didn't chain guzzle haste pots until we entered BT simply because the ingredients are hard to get on our AH and I am not an herbalist.<br>

</div>Well no argument from me that the two Expertise granting Human racials are crazy good, and bugged.  10 Expertise skill on each weapon if you are using a sword and mace has to be unintended.<br>
<br>
AOE encounters too, there is no doubt our trash/multi target DPS was going up with WW getting an offhand swing in and a 10 charge SS replacing Deathwish...how many of those fights are there though, outside of trash?<br>
<br>
Not everyone is a Human, or an Orc, and most bosses involve single target DPS.  17/44 was nerfed and unless they make some changes, the spec is terminal.</div>

</div>Well I agree with this, I don't wanted to show, that our DPS improved... it's only an example how it improved on multitarget fights. Didn't use the human expertise bug though I could do that.

		<div id="post_message_551197">I've been having some trouble lately - notably over the past month or so my DPS (using Gorefiend as an example) has gone down week by week.<br>
<br>
About a month ago I hit ~1550 DPS, the next week was 1400, week after 1330, and this week I only pulled about 1260.<br>
<br>
Tonight's WWS: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304041653/http://wowwebstats.com/te1tksytxh3cg?s=864-1122&amp;a=21" target="_blank">Kiranat - WWS</a><br>
Last Week's WWS: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304041653/http://wowwebstats.com/jxkwrvslztehg" target="_blank">Wow Web Stats</a><br>
<br>
On this latest attempt Recklessness was down (1% wipe the pull before), but I simply cannot figure out how I lost nearly 300 DPS while improving my gear and, if anything, becoming even more strict on my timing for a slam rotation. <br>
<br>
The only thing I can see that's a big difference is that my miss rate has gone up. I've only been able to swap out gear to get to 117 hit (vs the ~100 previously needed by humans) but I would think that between the Expertise and Weapon Mastery that my miss rate would have effectively gone DOWN. Of course, on top of this I stand to lose an additional 22 hit rating by picking up the Divine Retribution legs off Bloodboil...<br>
<br>
My current stats are roughly as follows: 1940 AP, 31% Crit, ~900 armor penetration.<br>
<br>
Any ideas? Would it be worthwhile to drop ~30 AP/175 armor ignore to go back to my Worgen Claw neck to gain some crit/hit after I pick up Leggings of Divine Retribution?<br>
<br>
As for future gear plans: I'm 1st in line for Bloodboil pants/ring, 2nd in line for Souls boots. We've never seen either drop in over two months of kills :\ Madness of the Betrayer is a long way off, and Tsuanmi Talisman is not an option as we no longer run SSC. I plan on swapping out Savagery for Executioner when S3 hits and I pick up a new PVP weapon.</div>

Maybe try using an attack swing timer add on so you can slam directly after your white hit.  Your slams should be hitting within one second of your melee.<br>
<br>
Other than that just make sure to stay over hit cap, for 2h it's crucial.</div>

Looking through it again it appears that most slams are starting .5 to .7s too late which I think can be attributed to my connection. Hopefully that will be resolved when I switch ISPs towards the end of the month.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Well I agree with this, I don't wanted to show, that our DPS improved... it's only an example how it improved on multitarget fights. Didn't use the human expertise bug though I could do that. I think 5 expertise and the -2% dodge from weapon mastery are more than enough (had 1% dodge during this fight... this is neglible).</div>

</div>Actually your report is clearly a sign of the buff we just received. At least as Humans/Orcs, and just like Kaan said NOT counting the bug we are buffed, end of story; and even without the expertise bonus everyone with a good slow offhand shouldn't see his damage going down. It's not like Karatress is a heavy aoe-fight, but he had a substantial increase; and in my experience my damage went up as well, although I'm still forced to use a fast offhand and it's not even a sword/mace.<br>
<br>
Moreover, I feel like I'm having way more fun with Sweeping Strikes. That being said, of course Death Wish should still be somewhat brought back, be it in place of a talent or making it trainable.<br>
<br>
One question now. I usually end up very high in the %damage done chart(#4 on Karatress and Hydross) even with some blue pieces and still a few enchants missing, but sometimes I'm behind people who dealt 100k damage less than me in the DPS one. Any tips on why? In my personal WoW experience though I have to say that the damage done chart is far more important, but I still can't figure out the reason of this.</div>

				</div>
				<div style="font-style:italic">I'd like some input on my talent build and gear choices, and also the most efficient way to do DPS on raids. I have pretty good gear on paper, but I seem to be underperforming most of the time. <br>
<br>
Here's a recent WWS from Teron:<br>
<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302190714/http://sisuguild.fi/~juha/wws/20071111-gorefiend/dahakon.html" target="_blank">WWS</a><br>
<br>
That's obviously prepatch, and I seem to be missing a lot, but I seem to remember Teron dodging/parrying a lot even from behind. I usually am threat capped in the beginning minutes of a fight, but then fall off, so I guess I'm not being as efficient as I could be. My gear is in the armory profile, I got <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302190714/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=32278"><span  ><span class="purplename">[Grips of Silent Justice]</span></span></a> and <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302190714/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=32345"><span  ><span class="purplename">[Dreadboots of the Legion]</span></span></a>, and I gemmed them 8str+8str on the gloves and +10hit +10 crit on the boots. These are not in the profile since I quit with alt-f4 last night..<br>
<br>
I usually use my rage as follows:<br>
<br>
BT when up<br>
WW when up<br>
If BT and WW are up, first BT, then WW.<br>
If rage &gt; 45, HS.<br>
At 20%, swap offhand to mainhand, and start executing until dead.<br>
<br>
Anyone see anything obvious I'm doing wrong?</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</div>Hmm, the biggest mistake I see is 22 instances of rampage in your WWS over a five minute fight. I suggest using rampage only when you have &lt; 5 seconds left on the buff. This gives you enough time to make sure that your AP bonus doesn't fall off while still avoiding wasting 30 rage early. It would seem that you are refreshing it every 10-15 seconds, which is probably netting a huge loss in special damage.<br>
<br>
You should change your meta to the relentless earthstorm diamond as quioxtic mentioned above and in order to meet the meta requirement for it you'll need to regem a couple of your pieces. Check out the sockets on your red belt of battle, the socket bonus is nice, eh? So in order to meet the meta requirement you'll need to throw in a green or purple gem into the blue slot. Also, check out your bracers. They also have a very nice socket bonus of 2 strength. Go ahead and throw a green or blue into that piece too. Not only will you lose very little in terms of raw stats, you'll gain access to the best dps meta in the game. Trust me, it is very much worth it.<br>
<br>
As far as your dreadboots go, that's a good start but I wouldn't worry about putting hit gems into a yellow socket. Just toss two +10 crit ones in and you'll do much better. Hit is a devalued stat when you have as much as you do right now. You're going to gain a better increase in damage if you shoot for stats like armor pen, crit, and strength.<br>
<br>
Which brings me to my next point. Get more armor pen!! It is an absolutely beautiful fury warrior stat and you should look for it wherever you can fit some in. I use the badge reward bracers for example. They do not have crit on them, but I noticed that you run with a feral druid in your group, so a slight loss of crit will not be an issue at all. Look for a couple pieces of gear that are heavy on armor pen and not so much on crit (hyjal trash neck is another one).<br>
<br>
Also, grab a season 3 1hander or two when the patch comes out. They are the best weapons for a fury warrior besides the warglaives and they are extremely versatile and stat heavy with armor pen, crit, ap, a high damage range, a hefty amount of stam for fights like najentus, and even some resilience for the after-raid battlegrounding. <br>
<br>
Whichever weapons you use, I would also suggest putting executioner on your mainhand. It's a great fury enchant according to every test I've read about.<br>
<br>
Hmm what else.. you said you're threat capped at the beginning of the fight. You can honestly only do as much damage as your tank will let you You have to have a tank who is able to produce a huge amount of TPS for fights like teron. We use a misdirect rotation which allows me to pretty much go all out from the very beginning of the fight. My gear isn't as good as yours, but I do a lot more damage and this may be a factor. Also, it doesn't hurt to wait a good five seconds before you lay in just in case your tank gets a string of misses or parries. The 2.3 patch will also help you here with the 10% threat reduction, so you should see an improvement.<br>
<br>
You also mentioned that you are getting dodged/parried a lot. Whenever a boss casts something on a raid member who is behind him he'll turn around for a split second. If by chance you use a bloodthirst during that split second you can definitely see some parries pop up. It's an unfortunate reality for melee dps. The only thing you can do is make absolutely sure that you stand behind the boss. Besides, a string if parries from your melee can easily get your tank killed, so this is an essential skill.</div>

</div>Yes it can, and no it isn't. Any instance where it overwrites itself is inherently inefficient, same with any instance where it isn't up. The problem is that you're not just decreasing one, you're shifting from it not being up to it being overwritten. Ergo, Executioner/Mongoose &gt; Double Executioner.</div>

I have read in many places of the "holy trinity" of warrior DPS stats being Strength, Crit and hit, with str&gt;crit&gt;hit, once hit is above 95.

I am currently sitting in the 160's for hit, with 2 +8 hit gems.  I have been recommended against gemming for hit, but I feel that if my hit were in the 150's, it may be too low.<br>

In practice, what minimum value of hit should you be looking at when acting as melee dps for those two raid environments?

If you don't have enough rage to sustain a good rotation (BT/WW on constant CD, HS spamming your little heart out), more hit. If you can afford to screw with your hit some, str/crit is a whole lot better. But while str and crit go a way towards mitigating lost rage from misses, it's not quite the same.</div>

</div>Never gem for hit unless you are under the hit cap for specials.  Once hit capped on specials, choose the best available gear to you for every slot, don't look at hit/crit/str(ap) in a vacuum, get the best stat distributed, highest iLvL piece per slot.  Gem for crit, as you want a higher flurry uptime, until you reach at least 30%+ unbuffed, but always get socket bonuses.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">There's no straight rule for hit, and anyone who says there is has to be a vapid dolt. The rule for hit is very simple. If you don't have enough rage to sustain a good rotation (BT/WW on constant CD, HS spamming your little heart out), more hit. If you can afford to screw with your hit some, str/crit is a whole lot better. But while str and crit go a way towards mitigating lost rage from misses, it's not quite the same.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</div><br>
I agree more or less, however, I have no problems in my crap gear to sustain a 3BT/2WW cycle so I honestly doubt that anyone doing raid dps will have problems with that. HS spamming on each hit won't be possible until you get really good gear (and I honestly doubt it's feasible even then). <br>
<br>
Hit doesn't magically give you more rage. If one point of hit rating gives you a 1% dps raise, your rage income will also go up by 1%. If 1 point of crit rating gives you 2% more damage, it will also give you 2% more rage. In general str/crit give a higher dps increase than crit (after reaching 9% anyway) thus also giving you better rage generation. The only thing that could possibly be an issue with low hit is that you might have more problems with miss streaks (and not getting enough rage to maintain the cycle), I've never had this problem, but then I've always liked fast weapons better anyway (even though they are not the optimum choice).</div>

</div>That's the primary reason I never looted one of the two Warboots that ever dropped for us and am still wearing Fel Leather.  I'll be getting the Nyn'jah's though once I get the badges. Those should be the best/easiest to get boots until the Dreadboots drop (we are working on RoS now, so it will be a while most likely).  This also begs the question; is agility still better than surefooted now for those using, or planning on using slower off hands?  The spreadsheet shows them both doing nearly identical "DPS".<br>

</div>The latest spreadsheet states the opposite.  While I appreciate all of the hard work people put into the spreadsheet updates, I find it mildly irritating that it seems that each revision changes what stats or enchants are "the best".  In some cases, what was an obvious upgrade becomes a downgrade, so you really have to just go with what is the easiest for you to obtain that may have stats you "feel" you are lacking.  In most cases, the upgrade paths follow a logical order from progression anyway, so it's not as though you would be hurting yourself by taking something, it's just that it seems for now, extreme min/maxing isn't really possible.</div>

The spreadsheet changes every version. like graul said, its very annoying, lol. I guess i will just stick with Executioner/mongoose for now, until someone comes up with some numbers that shows potency being the better OH enchant. Or maybe they will just release a 25/30str weapon enchant in sunwell! wtb!</div>

I could adjust my spec a bit by taking imp whirlwind instead of imp execute and get a slower offhand, but even with generous theoretical dps additions from those changes the lack of deathwish is noticeable. I'm confident that I can manage around 1830 dps on teron as MS spec having done 1812 (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302190714/http://www.juggernautguild.com/wws/2.2/wws-20071023-2331/index.html" target="_blank">WWS</a>) before 2.3 and with the dps boost from the weapon mastery change. So, unless I messed up big time in my spec or dps rotation, or got very unlucky, there seems to be pretty much no reason to go dw fury over ms spec as the first or only dps spec warrior in a given raid.</div>

My previous bests were 1951 on Teron (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302190714/http://www.juggernautguild.com/wws/2.2/wws-20071011-2025/index.html" target="_blank">WWS</a>) and 1587 on Council (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302190714/http://www.juggernautguild.com/wws/2.2/wws-20071017-2255/index.html" target="_blank">WWS</a>), and since then I have received a couple of significant upgrades (dst and stormrage signet ring) so I would've expected to do higher than I did. I could adjust my spec a bit by taking imp whirlwind instead of imp execute and get a slower offhand, but even with generous theoretical dps additions from those changes the lack of deathwish is noticeable. I'm confident that I can manage around 1830 dps on teron as MS spec having done 1812 (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302190714/http://www.juggernautguild.com/wws/2.2/wws-20071023-2331/index.html" target="_blank">WWS</a>) before 2.3 and with the dps boost from the weapon mastery change. So, unless I messed up big time in my spec or dps rotation, or got very unlucky, there seems to be pretty much no reason to go dw fury over ms spec as the first or only dps spec warrior in a given raid.</div>

</div>I have no clue on how the Teron fight works in practice, but from your logs it seems that you're not able to do the dps cycle fully all of the time. With a 199 sec fight time (from the mean dps and total damage), you should be able to get off 33 BT (theoretical maximum, ofc not achievable), you have made 27. With 0/2 Imp WW you should also be able to do (again theoretically) 19 WW, you have done 14 (assuming that the log shows the MH/OH hits separately). Not sure if you can improve this, perhaps it's impossible to do better than that in practice (I haven't really studied my own logs, so sorry if I'm sounding like a know-it-all <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302190714im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/wink.gif" border="0" alt="" title=";)" class="inlineimg"> ).<br>
<br>
Anyway, 1/2 Imp WW is quite important to make the dps cycles work, it let's you do the cycle with less cd collisions (you will still get some, latency is never 0). With a 9 sec cd on WW the theoretical number of WW's is 22, i.e. a 15% increase. Translating that into a 15% increase in WW damage for you would mean about 20 dps. Not sure how this compares with having 1/2 instead of 2/2 in imp exec. It could also possible make it easier to get more BT/WW's off in the first place.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">vultur, with a 2h build crit can actually be worth more output dps than AP for some levels of gear. With sub 30% crit you may have problems keeping flurry up (even with a 2h weapon, which otherwise need way less crit than DW to keep flurry up). I would value 1 crit rating to be worth something like 2.2 AP (i.e. 1 crit rating = 1.1 str, neglecting BoK).<br>
<br>
Also, Slam is an incredibly powerful ability if correctly used, asfaik the best possible dps for a slam-2h build is to make a cycle like (with Slam always triggered immediately after the white attack):<br>
Autoattack-Slam-MS<br>
Autoattack-Slam-WW<br>
Autoattack-Slam-MS<br>
Autoattack-Slam-(Hamstring if you have Sword spec or Battleshout or just save rage)<br>
<br>
If you don't get enough rage to maintain this, skip WW and do it whenever you have the rage and MS is on cd.</div>

I usually dont have rage to keep a rotation like this. Sometimes even skipping WW I still lack rage.

</div>33/28 is pretty crap if you dont have wf, in my experience. You tend to get very low on rage. I would say that dw fury is always superior if you compare the 2 builds, if you are only talking about your own dps that is. The total raid dps is a entierly different matter.</div>

</div>Fast offhand was never a myth. It's true it didn't matter after the normalisation of unbriddled wrath but still it was always a possible preference for a smoother rage gain.<br>
<br>
Now, with double whirlwinds, favor has moved towards slow OH. But as said WW has a) little percentage of my damage and b) gains more from overall ap then the actuall weapon speed. So the dps gain, while existing, might be very low depending on which weapons you can choose from.<br>
<br>
So now, fast offhand is still a possible preference. If you have a nice slow OH and can handle its rage fine, by all means go for it. But if you use a good fast offhand you get smoother rage gain and you wont miss out on much dps.</div>

</div>In theory (and in spreadsheets) this is how it works, BUT in practice you can run into problems with a slow/slow setup and low hit rating (i.e. &gt;9% but only by a small margin). Miss streaks can then potentially have the effect that your rage generation gets so low that you cannot maintain your cycle (3BT/2WW). Sure, you will have some "hit streaks" as well where rage will be more than enough for the cycle, but you won't be able to make up for the  lost damage in of a missed cycle. With fast weapons, the fact that you get rage in smaller chunks will mean that a miss is less damaging for your rage generation. Ofc, if you have very good gear (and/or high hit) you will not notice this effectas much, you will nearly always have enough rage for the cycle.<br>
<br>
As long as your not using a dagger offhand, running with a fast offhand will not affect your dps by much, the damage lost from WW will be small (since most of the damage come from AP anyway). A fast offhand will probably cause your flurry uptime to go down by 2-4%, but the total damage loss from using a fast OH will be on the order of 1%. So there is no reason to pick a slow offhand with lower dps/stats, but if you have the choice of two equal weapon, the slower will give you a little bit higher total dps (if you don't count possible cycle failures).<br>
<br>
Execute is alwyas better with a fast/fast setup, but you can switch to 2 fast weapons for that phase.</div>

</div>Consistency. I have used fast OH for a while, but I still keep a slow weapon around for things like AOE. It allows you to run with less hit rating without worrying about having rage. Yes a slower OH will do more WW damage, yes you will lose a bit of flurry uptime. But the change is so small even assuming you have perfect rotations and dont have miss streaks. Switching from a Merc Gladiator Hacker to Cleaver is a gain of 8 dps, out of a theoretical 1265, and that is if you have perfect cycles and no miss streaks. Now if your chance to dodge/miss is about 15%, then you have a 2% chance of not getting any rage for 2 seconds(2.6 speed with flurry). For me thats about 24 rage. Now if somehow you are at the point where you never say you dont need any more rage, which people have said doesn't really happen often, then fast OH holds no advantage. <br>
<br>
This is not saying that Fast or Slow OH is better, but it comes down to the rage consistency that you are comfortable with. <br>
It also depends on itemization, I dont think anyone would use <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302183734/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=28729"><span  ><span class="purplename">[Spiteblade]</span></span></a> over <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302183734/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=32369"><span  ><span class="purplename">[Blade of Savagery]</span></span></a>.</div>

		<div id="post_message_558863">I'm doing fine with my slow/slow setup. My problem is, that my raid usally  has another dw-warrior who gets in the melee grp. That's why I haven't been able to test my true potential for quite some time in a consistent way, because I don't have that much time to show up for every raid. Although the funny thing, I tanked Kael+a few bosses in Hyal when our MT was absent. So my raid trusts me, but most of the time I'm stucked in a non-melee grp. Lucky to get a druid or hunter there...<br>
<br>
My WWS stats are ok, but without totems+leader of the pack I lack quite some dmg opportunities.<br>
<br>
I will go for another fast OH for execute time, though. Rage burst are sometimes a problem, but as long as I can maintain my cycle I won't change my setup.<br>
<br>
<br>
Btw. please support the change T6 threads in off. blizz forums.  I find it very unpleasant to see S3 getting started with new gear/weapons and the T6 stuff not upgraded, as they did with T5...<br>
<br>
I don't buy into the "but warrior got agi and with pala-buffs..."  .... Give me some Crit Rating! They changed T5 and admitted it was a mistake when they put agility on T5. Now please change T6, otherwise I'm thinking of passing most of the tokens to build a T6 nonset equivalent.</div>

I've scanned the thread on various search keywords but I haven't been able to find an answer to my question. I plugged my 33/28 gear into the spreadsheet and it suggests a 4x Slam, MS/WW rotation.

The other thing I'm wondering is what I do when the boss is &lt;19% HP, I've heard people say that I should just continue the normal rotation and forget about executing and some others say that I should swap to DW and execute.</div>

Thanks for the advice I suppose I'll have a go at it tonight in Mount Hyjal. <br>
<br>
Edit: Is there a certain point where I want to start casting Slam? I've heard people mention 0.5 seconds after the white hit lands to maximise dps.</div>

		<div id="post_message_559591">As close as possiblie to the melee hit before the slam.  If you hit it at the same time, it will hit 0.5 seconds into the melee swing timer which is the most efficient and therefore highest DPS.  Of course, hitting it at the exact time the melee hits is essentially impossible due to lag, but as long as the slam hits within one second of your melee you're fine.  That means you have an 0.5 second margin of error, including lag, which isn't much but possible to do nonetheless.  Again, it requires a lot of concentration to keep it going every time with as little possible time between your melee and your slam but this is what you should aim for.<br>
<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302210418/http://wowwebstats.com/uuvgmz2tkuxj3?s=17310-17534&amp;bl=17310&amp;fia=63&amp;fiaa=i&amp;fit=0" target="_blank">Wow Web Stats</a><br>
<br>
That's from a few Teron attempts, though we haven't killed him yet due to people who are unable to kill ghosts, which is beyond me, btw.  Most slams are hitting between 0.7s - 1.5s after the melee swing, which I'm content with, though there's room for improvement.<br>
<br>
Oh and another note, I usually let my healers know that I'm popping recklessness since in fights like Teron you WILL need more healing.</div>

Unluckily enough my guild doesn't have an Enhancement Shaman, they didn't even have a dedicated Fury Warrior before me and sometimes melee group doesn't get a shaman at all....They prefer to run with three rogues.

By the way, I didn't have Greaves of the Bloodwarder in that fight(took them from her very dead corpse); I used Warbringer Greaves without the enchant before.</div>

Week 1# Run your usual content without a shaman, log all the data and create a WWS report.<br>

Week 2# Run the same content (and same group setup) with a shaman dropping WF, again log the data and create a WWS report.<br>

</div>Good idea, will do. <br>
<br>
And of course an Enhancement Shaman could provide an even greater benefit given Unleashed Rage, Imp SoE and Imp WF totem. Quite frankly the group would do a lot more total DPS than with a rogue, even if he has good gear. <br>

</div>Yep, it's mostly the rage benefit.  Also, I'm sword specced and I tend to get these nifty strings of Melee -&gt; Sword spec extra attack -&gt; WF proc off of the extra attack -&gt; sword spec extra attack off of the WF proc. :P They're awesome and happen more often than you'd think.  Oh, we killed Teron for the first time yesterday; here's WWS with a resto shaman in group.<br>

I'm interested to see if anybody has recorded attempts with higher dps on those bosses post wf/sword spec/dst nerfs, I certainly don't have the best possible gear but those beat my previous bests by a fair amount. I was using my current spec on the armory, and my gear was an optimal bt/hyjal ms setup.</div>

		<div id="post_message_561538">I guess id have to agree with you, MS is better for the raid. I did 1940 dps on Anetheron, I can post wws later if people need but it hasn't been posted on our forums yet, dunno why. Teron I got screwed over this week, but Ill try next week as 33/28. I would assume Id do about the same dps as Anetheron, 1900's. DW fury I did 2066 dps on him, so for the benafit of the raid, MS is better. Only problem is, I really find DW fury more fun in raids, but if it comes down to a fight like loathab in sunwell where we need all the dps we can get, 33/28 it is.<br>
<br>
Also 2 questions for you Modrack. Since coming to Drow, it has for the most part been a very positive experience, except for the fact that they want the dps warrior to have improved demo to debuff, which I noticed you don't have to do. I know many guilds have the dps war do it, some don't. improved demo comes at the loss of UW, and having to spam it because its resist 1/2 the time hurts rotations. Since we are on farm now and blast through hyjal/bt they are letting me just go all out and dps on some bosses rather then help debuff. My question is, how do you get out of having to do that? a prot warrior with imp demo, or you just go completely without it?<br>
<br>
2nd question makes me feel dumb because you must know something neither BT guild I've been in knows, but how are you avoiding Kaz'rogal's constant stuns? even standing max melee range Im getting hit by it. to do the same dps on him your doing on teron you must not be getting interupted at all.</div>

If, and I havent yet seen a WWS with both MS and Fury so I wont claim to know, MS does more damage and brings blood frenzy, what should the role of fury be? Its a lot less defined what direction the trees are taking. Not so much in terms of getting raid spots, but in definition.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Also 2 questions for you Modrack. Since coming to Drow, it has for the most part been a very positive experience, except for the fact that they want the dps warrior to have improved demo to debuff, which I noticed you don't have to do. I know many guilds have the dps war do it, some don't. improved demo comes at the loss of UW, and having to spam it because its resist 1/2 the time hurts rotations. Since we are on farm now and blast through hyjal/bt they are letting me just go all out and dps on some bosses rather then help debuff. My question is, how do you get out of having to do that? a prot warrior with imp demo, or you just go completely without it?<br>
<br>
2nd question makes me feel dumb because you must know something neither BT guild I've been in knows, but how are you avoiding Kaz'rogal's constant stuns? even standing max melee range Im getting hit by it. to do the same dps on him your doing on teron you must not be getting interupted at all.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">So I went to Maxdps.com and i input my stats for my fury warrior. What puzzled me is it said the third best mh in the game for me is talon of the phoenix. It says it produces better dps than a dragonstrike, syphon, rising tide. The only better mh's in the game it says are any of the s3 mh's or the warglaives. Thoughts opinions on this?<br>
<br>
I even changed alot of stats around because i figured ok maybe its favoring hit. So i put my hit at 300 and it still said it was the third best mh in the game.</div>

We ran SSC last night to get a vial for a newer member, and I was expecting to see higher overall DPS than what I had been doing before we were all attuned for BT.  On the average Hyjal/BT boss I sit at around 1550 DPS, some up to 2150 (as 17/44) and we don't do Bloodlust rotations and normally use a 3x Rogue, War, Enh Shaman group.

</div>BF will be the equivalent of 200-300 DPS depending on the setup of your raid.  2/2 BF 3/5 Flurry will always be better than 5/5 Flurry, unless, of course, you have another BF warrior in the raid (which is a bad idea anyways).  On another note, 5/5 Flurry and 3.5 speed weapons will make a slam rotation a bitch to keep up.  The weapon gets too fast to have your slam and the GCD from your instant plus lag.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I'm interested to see if anybody has recorded attempts with higher dps on those bosses post wf/sword spec/dst nerfs, I certainly don't have the best possible gear but those beat my previous bests by a fair amount. I was using my current spec on the armory, and my gear was an optimal bt/hyjal ms setup.</div>

</div>I have a question to ask related to this.  I took a look at your armory and summed up your AC pent.. 826, not counting Cataclysm's Edge.  I have similar gear minus the sword, though not 4pc t6, I use chest and gloves with Illidari Shatterer, Blood Stained Pauldrons and Leggings of Divine Retribution plus the bow off Zul'jin making the lion's share of my AC pent.  I have a Torch of the Damned (Mace Spec) and sit around -850 AC, with 2k AP and 31% crit rate in Berserker Stance.<br>
<br>
Yet, last night on Gorefiend I only did 1300 dps - with flask and food.  I can only conclude that i'm doing something wrong.<br>
<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302201558/http://www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Stormrage&amp;n=Charsi" target="_blank">Here is my armory, which shows me in PvP gear for some reason</a>.<br>
<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302201558/http://wowwebstats.com/xxpi3t4mijsbu?s=5452-5700" target="_blank">Here is a WWS of Gorefiend from last night.</a><br>
<br>
I realise that I failed to use Bloodlust Brooch entirely (duh) and used Death Wish too late to use it again sub 20%, but I find it difficult to believe that those two factors alone can be responsible for a 300+ dps deficit.  Another MS warrior in my guild has hit 1600 on Gorefiend (without Slam).  That's where *I* want to be, but it's just not happening.  He, like Modrack, has 4pc T6 and Cataclysm's Edge, but again, I can't see this attributable to 350 AC pent and sword specialization.<br>
<br>
Can anyone see what I might be able to do to improve?</div>

I noticed a lot when I went from Stormherald to Zul'jin's sword.  Other than this, I don't know what to tell you.  Don't use HS unless the next white hit will tip you over 100 rage, I guess, but I doubt rage is a problem without using slam.</div>

		<div id="post_message_561775">I am specced into Improved Slam and have used it on prior attempts (where I get roughly the same DPS, although I got three significant upgrades since last reset: T6 chest, Pauldrons, and Executioner enchant).  This week was more or less an experiment in not using Slam, largely because my guildmate doesn't use it and pulls down very strong dps on virtually every fight.<br>
<br>
He also suggested that i'm overusing HS, so I will try and clear that up.  I would take a Cataclysm's Edge in a heartbeat if it dropped.<br>
<br>
Edit: typically our Shaman pop heroism at 19% which ruins any slam rotation that I try at that point, since my weapon speed drops into the low 2.x's.  I have considered a weapon swap (TF/Swiftsteel) for execute range with Recklessness, I get a lot of white misses but can easily execute on every gcd.  I didn't try it last night at all though.<br>
<br>
Criticism of my consumable use is more than fair, I forgot my haste pots in the mail and changed my bloodlust brooch bind <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302201558im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/frown.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":(" class="inlineimg"></div>

2. Consumable / item / ability use. The previous WWS used insane strength pot iirc? Also times deathwish &amp; trinkets well.<br>

3. Executes. The previous WWS, he only hit execute once. With the level of gear we have, spamming execute with your 2-hander is a REDUCTION in dps from your slam rotation.

		<div id="post_message_561845">In response to Charsi, several things stand out:<br>
<br>
1. Gear differences. Mace spec is virtually useless for raids as I'm sure you're aware (good luck on getting Cataclysm to drop again soon), and the Torch has haste on it which is a very low valued stat. The differences in weapon spec are probably negligible in this specific comparison though because I only got 3 sword spec procs on the Teron attempt in question. So the only real differences are haste on the mace and higher weapon dps from Cataclysm being 10 ilevels higher. Aside from that, I run 4pc t6, so in the same number of mortal strikes (22), I did 64k damage versus your 50k. This is also partially attributable to my having lotp as I critted two more than you.<br>
<br>
2. Spec differences. Most notably, you have points in imp intercept against my points in imp disciplines (2/3), and 4 extra seconds on recklessness can make a big difference. Aside from that as you mentioned you're specced into slam but did not use it, and I can almost certainly assure you that using slam will be a large increase in damage. Especially with a 3.8 speed weapon, there should be no problems with timing.<br>
<br>
3. Raid differences and other factors. The biggest difference between our parses that I can see is that your teron kill appears to last about a minute longer than mine, or about 33% more combat time. This will significantly reduce your reported dps. Less time on the kill means a higher percentage of my combat time is spent with some kind of timer or cooldown up, be it bloodlust or potion or deathwish or recklessness or trinkets or any combination thereof. You may also want to check on little things like faerie fire and curse of recklessness always being up. Also, the unsung hero of other factors, luck may have played a part. I've done 1950 dps on Teron as fury and then come back the next week and done 1650 without changing anything up or making any mistakes. It looks like the only place you really got unlucky was with heroic strikes, and as has been stated heroic strikes are basically already a waste of rage, and with an 18% crit rate like you had they can just kill your dps.<br>
<br>
On another note, execute is not at all a waste. I used one insane strength pot on my Teron log at the beginning of the fight because it's the best option I think while continuing to slam. At the end of the fight I used deathwish, recklessness, and a haste pot and got a pretty amazing dps boost (I generally try to use haste pots during bloodlust and/or execute spam when I'm not slamming, and if I have insane strength I use it in a rare situation like this where I can drop a pot cooldown and know that I won't be getting bloodlust). Now, I don't spam execute, I give mortal strike and usually whirlwind priority if I have rage, but if they're on cooldown or I only get 20 or so rage per round I'll execute. I only had 1 execute "hit" on my Teron log, but I had 7 crits. I keep forgetting to bring my two swiftsteel bludgeons while raiding as MS to see how much of a difference it makes &lt;20%, but I have a hard time using non swords as a sword spec. Not that it would've mattered much this time I guess since I got three fucking sword spec procs.<br>
<br>
Anyway I hope that helps, and good luck with your weapon drops and future ms dps. In response to Cruorr I definitely understand enjoying fury more than ms, but I think on my part it comes down to laziness. Keeping up solid slam rotations with dst and cataclysm's edge can be a challenge sometimes, but all in all I think ms can be more entertaining, and as the numbers show there's really no comparison between the overall raid dps contributed by ms vs fury.</div>

		<div id="post_message_561912">I'm afraid this is another 'what am I doing wrong?' post. I've read up carefully on my fury theorycrafting, have had quite a bit of practice and use the spreadsheet. However, having just read of warriors doing some 1500dps (sustained) on Gorefiend as Arms I wonder why I'm no where near that as fury on SSC bosses. This is the link to my guild's WWS from last night's Morogrim fight: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302201558/http://wowwebstats.com/nbns51jjt2mvs?s=7243-8018&amp;a=2" target="_blank">Loading...</a> although it includes all the other bosses bar Vashj as well.

<br>
I was keeping up demo shout and sunder armour (no useful warrs around), and certainly I was skimping on the haste pots, but otherwise I'm not sure what to complain about.

<br>
Another important question. How much to people find that the DPS they output in game differs from what the spreadsheet says? If so, by how much?

<br>
Which sharpening stone should I use on my off-hand? Adamantite (12 weapon damage, 14 crit rating) or Elemental (28 crit rating). My off-hand is 1.5 speed. <br>
<br>
I've seen many use Adamantite but from a number of sources I've heard/read that the Elemental results in more dps, which is easily possible, as an additional 14 crit rating affects main hand white as well as yellow damage, and the offhand does a small portion (38%) of an already small portion (40-50%) of a warrior's total damage.<br>
<br>
Is there a point at which one stone is better than the other, or is one better than the other pretty much all of the time? Thanks.</div>

		<div id="post_message_562740">Cataclysm's just dropped for us last night (armory hasn't updated in over 24 hours for some reason) and I picked it up to have a better PvP weapon than what I had been using (Trollbane).  I specced 33/28 from my normal 17/44 and did similar DPS as to what I had been doing before, but could have probably done even better if I had been timing slams better (didn't really get it down good until Teron).  Ended up doing 1682 (War/Sham/Rogue x3) on Teron without any haste potions and I didn't bother trying to switch to two fast one handers with only a 9% hit rating for Executes.  Execute doesn't seem to be a waste at all on Teron with a 2h, especially when you almost always have enough rage (more than enough) to hit it every, or near every global with Bloodlust going.  With Bloodlust and DST active, trying to do the typical Slam rotation seems to just be more of a waste than mashing Execute on that fight.  It would be even harder with a haste pot active.<br>

</div>Missing a Slam due to a Flurry or DST proc annoys me to no end, as does having to use a 50 - 100 rage Execute on a mob that keeps being yanked away right when a Slam is about to hit.  I don't particularly care for it, it's just a change of pace for now, but I can quickly see myself getting sick of it on raids. I also don't plan on seeking out pure 2h optimal gear when I am doing Arena for 2x 1h weapons.  I'd have to see some very convincing evidence that BF is adding enough of a boost to *our* raids for me to consider it worth the annoyance factor of this spec.  Teron is really a poor fight to base the Arms vs Fury argument on anyway due to how much rage you get from it.  I noticed a significant drop on Najentus and Bloodboil, while our Rogues and Hunter seemed to be doing the same they always do.  Shade and Teron saw an extremely minor personal boost and again, our Rogues and Hunter seemed to be doing the same as before.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">So to continue my comparison of MS and fury post 2.3, I had a pretty good set of boss kills yesterday as MS which I think further reinforces my earlier point that MS is vastly superior to fury as the first or only dps warrior in a given raid.<br>

</div>Well, I'm not sure but won't the stance switches (to keep up the sunders) play havoc with your rage generation and slam cycles? I'd guess that you could lose 10-20% personal dps from this only. Also, you need WF to get the really high dps. I don't really think you can expect more than 850 without WF and having to stanceswitch.<br>
<br>
Spreadsheet dps is always higher than the dps in game. For me it's about 20% (up to 40% if I'm slacking) off as DW fury. Not sure why, maybe I'm overusing HS but it feels like I can do BT/WW whenever up. Don't use the spreadsheet to model "true dps", that is not what it's meant for. You should only use it to compare gear setups, and to calculate accurate SEP values. It can possibly also be used to compare minor talent changes, but certainly not to compare arms and fury specs.</div>

</div>Your DPS is nowhere near "bad" if you are sundering (which I guess Gruntle forgot can be done from Bersker?) and also DS, but really, if in a raid that has two non DPS Warriors and a Feral Druid (who is on DPS) you are having to sunder, something is really wrong.  The biggest problem with your DPS appears to be AP related at a glance, and the lack of a Shaman in conjunction to you debuffing instead of focusing on DPS.  As far as Warriors breaking X DPS in BT and such, I just posted how there is a huge disparity in the average damage melee can do in SSC compared to BT.  The highest DPS I've ever done in SSC was 1225 on Karathress before the WF nerf.  The average I do in Hyjal/BT now is 1550 on most fights.  We just did SSC the other night and my damage was much lower than in the other zones.</div>

</div>At first glance, I would say Earthquake proccing Enrage doesn't seem plausible, but I suppose it is a damaging ability. As far as proccing Enrage, yes, wearing resilience will allow for those 'when crit procs' to proc. It is calculated before simple defense.<br>
Also, I do recall proccing Enrage on the fire in the Org BG queue room.</div>

				Missing a Slam due to a Flurry or DST proc annoys me to no end, as does having to use a 50 - 100 rage Execute on a mob that keeps being yanked away right when a Slam is about to hit.

</div>I've been following this thread since the beginning but I've never posted since this being an end game discussion and I'm not exactly in the position to contribute to end game DPS-ing (In mostly pvp/kara gear). With that said, missing a slam can be endlessly irritating, however I've noticed that due to latency 90% of the time halfway through the slam cast I can move and slam will still hit.  This helped alot when mobs get yanked away during your slam cast, it's especially useful in some PvP situations too, a few slams can do some miracle burst damage.  Personally I feel 33/28 to be a very fun and interactive spec due to the slam timing instead of a strict "wait for CD and hit button" rotation.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">So to continue my comparison of MS and fury post 2.3, I had a pretty good set of boss kills yesterday as MS which I think further reinforces my earlier point that MS is vastly superior to fury as the first or only dps warrior in a given raid.<br>

<br>
I'm interested to see if anybody has recorded attempts with higher dps on those bosses post wf/sword spec/dst nerfs, I certainly don't have the best possible gear but those beat my previous bests by a fair amount. I was using my current spec on the armory, and my gear was an optimal bt/hyjal ms setup.</div>

</div>I am 17/44, so not Arms.  But we had a night last week where we did all of those bosses in a night so I thought I would link and compare.<br>

I had LOTP and an enhancement Shaman.  No BF or Expose in the raid.  We do have a Ret Pal though.<br>

My gear is very solid.  Cloak, ring, ranged slot upgrades are out there for me, but they are minor.  OH Warglaive would obviously give me a big boost, and if I was shooting for personal DPS I could rep Solarian's.  But overall I have very good gear, I certainly cant complain.<br>
<br>
So, yeah pretty disappointing comparison to yours.  You did better on 2 of the 3 and on Gorefiend, it was very close.  Lets assume its a wash on personal DPS...you are throwing a 4% buff to all physical DPS...in my raid that would be a lot more total damage.  The Future of a Fury DPS Warrior is bleak unless something changes.  There is no reason to take Fury over Arms with the first DPS Warrior, and if you are building a raid (or guild) from the ground up, is there room for two+ DPS Warriors?  I suspect all the Fury Warriors that are flourishing in endgame PVE guilds are people that have been around a long while or in leadership positions.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Your DPS is nowhere near "bad" if you are sundering (which I guess Gruntle forgot can be done from Bersker?) and also DS, but really, if in a raid that has two non DPS Warriors and a Feral Druid (who is on DPS) you are having to sunder, something is really wrong.  The biggest problem with your DPS appears to be AP related at a glance, and the lack of a Shaman in conjunction to you debuffing instead of focusing on DPS.  As far as Warriors breaking X DPS in BT and such, I just posted how there is a huge disparity in the average damage melee can do in SSC compared to BT.  The highest DPS I've ever done in SSC was 1225 on Karathress before the WF nerf.  The average I do in Hyjal/BT now is 1550 on most fights.  We just did SSC the other night and my damage was much lower than in the other zones.</div>

I think there's definitely room for more than one dps warrior. They serve as great offtanks and do more damage than all the other hybrids.  We typically still run 5 warrior raids because we had a lot of warriors going into TBC and they still play.  If the guild was starting fresh now, we wouldn't take 5, but 4 isn't out of the question.</div>

But once you get the Warglaives (or even S3?), only then can you make any definite claims on what is going to add the most raid DPS.  Comparing optimal to non optimal just doesn't do it.  I just went from a Wicked Edge and S2 fast off hand to a CE.  Do you really think the spec is what is keeping me at similar DPS?  I sure don't.</div>

</div>2h Fury probably beats 33/28/0 in terms of higher personal dps, but 33/28 will still add more rage damage, and the damage difference between the two won't be as dramatic (you have 5/5 flurry with 2h fury so timing slams also becomes more difficult if you're using a weapon like say CE).</div>

		<div id="post_message_564133">I don't mean to break up the current 2H[BF] vs DW[fury] discussion but...<br>
<br>
Something I've tried since 2.3 is gearing for pure +crit. Although I understand it's been hashed and rehashed in the past, but a recent outlook on flurry might be an area DW fury might look into further? Often one hears 'ap makes the fury tree' but some dynamics have changed.<br>
Pre-2.3 the fury warrior populace was divided between slow/fast MH/OH and slow/slow MH/OH under the argument of smoother rage generation versus higher flurry uptime. The new WW changes have cemented the slow/slow argument, for example.<br>
My reasoning is as such: s2/t5 weapons (and of course s3/t6) along with corresponding gear pack enough of a punch that rage is never an issue when looking to spam BT/WW on each c/d, with HStrikes, Hamstrings and Rampage refreshes when GCD allows. As such, stacking AP/str isn't needed to hit harder for rage. Also, the new WW provides a very comparable dps output compared to BT for similar rage as well. Lastly, AP is very easy to raid buff- BoKings, food, flasks/elixirs, Unleashed Rage etc whereas crit is fairly constant not counting LotP.<br>
<br>
I haven't been back into SSC/TK for testing much compared to pre-2.3 WWS's I have, but I'm curious to know how:<br>
2.6/2.6 s3 MH/OH<br>
2k ap unbuffed<br>
170hit<br>
37% crit<br>
<br>
would fare compared to:<br>
2.6/2.6 s3 MH/OH<br>
2.6k ap unbuffed<br>
210hit<br>
31% crit<br>
<br>
Maybe the future of the [fury] dps warrior is seeking perma-flurry. With the slow/slow setup being unarguably the optimal setup, it also allows for more instant attacks. Since flurry is the one talent an MS/BF specced warrior cannot max out, perhaps it is the area that might prove the saving grace for fury? Keep in mind more crits means an easier time predicting refreshing Rampage with &lt; 3sec left.<br>
Perhaps it is all a 'moo point' (thank you Joey), but just tossing the idea of a crit-obsessed gear setup out there.</div>

Perhaps, when you can't execute every GCD without imp. execute. But otherwise - it will lower your rage gaining a bit and also your overall DPS. Also, according to the spreadsheet, it would be a loss of 21 DPS (with my setup).</div>

Maybe the future of the [fury] dps warrior is seeking perma-flurry. With the slow/slow setup being unarguably the optimal setup, it also allows for more instant attacks. Since flurry is the one talent an MS/BF specced warrior cannot max out, perhaps it is the area that might prove the saving grace for fury?</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</div>Slow/slow as unarguably optimal setup is very likely true at t5-t6 level of gear. But It's certainly not the end of the world to use a fast OH (or actually not to use a fast MH either). Yes, you lose some WW damage (most of the damage will be from the AP part anyway) and your flurry uptime goes down by 2-4% (from slow/slow to slow/fast, for formulae check Ceasars port in the spreadsheet thread). All in all this means that you lose perhaps 3% of your total dps (in theory, that's what I get in the spreadsheet anyway).<br>
<br>
What people tend to forget is the fact that fast weapon setups give you a much smoother rage generation and are thus a lot less vulnerable to miss streaks for the rage generation (this is very evident for Execute phase, but there you can easily switch in fast weapons). If you have lowish hit (which you will have if you go for a crit-heavy setup) miss streaks might cause you to miss important cooldowns (BT or WW) with a slow setup. This might not be the case at all for endgame gear, where rage in plentiful, but for starting 25-mans it might very well be enough to choose a fast OH.</div>

</div>Hello guys!  This is my first post, but I do read here quite a bit.  I just have one question though that has been bugging me for some time.  I played a warrior for a bit in TBC, just up into early SSC/TK.  I was our MT, so my DPS experience was lacking, but I feel I was pretty good at it.  And I know that you out gear my warrior by quite a bit, but I'm just wondering how those numbers are possible?  I looked at your WWS, so its not that I don't believe it, but my guilds have always ran recount and we have always looked at that as being pretty accurate.  <br>
<br>
So I guess my question is the gear actually scaling that much?  Or does WWS not take into consideration things like movement time where you are doing 0 DPS?  Is the DPS just calculated different somehow?  I just remember in my old guild we had three very solid rogues, all of whom were putting out around 1k sustained DPS according to recount, and that rogue on your Gorefiend WWS is at 2245, haha.<br>
<br>

</div>1) It won't help that much, though sure some.  As long as your slams are hitting within one second of your white hit you should be fine.<br>
<br>
2) Use them, they will definitely boost your DPS.  Flask + haste/insane strength potions.<br>
<br>
3) Like you said, it's around 80DPS.<br>
<br>
4) Yes.<br>
<br>
5) Get a swing timer add on, it's easy to time the slams correctly that way.</div>

</div>Another very important part of the equation is that this increased raid dps means that the fights last a shorter period of time, which in turn means that you will be spending a larger percentage of that time with on cooldown abilities such as heroism/bloodlust and recklessness.

				<div style="font-style:italic">I have been reading this post since its incarnation. Although I am not geared as well as some of you I dont think my gear is all that bad. I have been using the DPS SS religiously. I am group with a feral druid and sometimes an enh shammy.<br>
<br>
But I cannot figure out how to do 1k dps that some of you are obviously attaining. Is it me or is it my raid as a whole?<br>
<br>
I am 17/44 spec. And you can link to my gear to the left.<br>
<br>
Any pointers, help, boots in the @$$ would be greatly appreciated.</div>

</div>Armory is down for me at the moment so I can't see if anything is wrong with your gear or if you're running with really low hit rating (anything sub 9% pretty much).<br>
<br>
The only thing I assume it could be if there's something wrong with the rotation you are doing in a raid or if you waste rage on abilities (refreshing rampage when there's &gt;5~7seconds left, or refreshing battleshout when it has &gt;15 seconds left).<br>
<br>
A thing to also note is that as your gear improves you will be able to fit more heroic strikes into your cycle making for more dps.<br>
<br>
Only other pointer I could give you is try to time CD's, having Haste Potion + Heroism + Recklessness up from &lt;19% makes for quite a large dps boost.<br>
<br>
If you could post a WWS we could get some more information.<br>
<br>

</div>If they are fury thats perfectly fine (they will probably also have precision in their build so they have a decent amount of hit).<br>
<br>
If they are arms they've overshot the hitcap, A raiding arms warrior needs 9% hit which should be around 150 hit rating of the top of my head.<br>

As for the rage dumping yes I am always threat capped when I have too much of it most of the time. I use subtlety to cloak and of course salve. Maybe I start off slower then go hard middle to end..........<br>

I was fury and have found it difficult to keep up with the dps.  Not sure if it was my rotation or whatnot.  I've taken a little break and would like to go back to my tried and true MS build.  My question today is on MS for end game.  <br>
<br>
What is the HR that I should shoot for?  ATM I'm at 203 if I can remember correctly.  I don't have a 2h wep yet but am in the works to aquiring one.<br>
<br>
What ap is good to have, is there even a cap?<br>
<br>
What crit should I be at?  Last I remember it was at 36.54 or somethign like that....not sure what % that is.<br>
<br>
I have the rotation down.  Just need a little advice on these other things for now.<br>
<br>
Ah forgot one.  My guild is in BT/HY atm, and I won't be raiding in there till I get myself setup correctly.  What 2h wep would benefit the most?  S2 axe or gorehowl or anything you know off hand??<br>

Sorry for not coming up with more exacts...I'm at work and can't access some of that info.<br>

</div>No, it is saying that the uptime gained per crit rating decreases as you gain crit. It is like an asymptote, you will approach but never reach. Once flurry is already up most of the time, which it will be in any decent gear, stacking crit in order to increase flurry uptime is ineffective. The primary gain from crit is doing more damage per swing.</div>

</div>I did some simple maths about this the other day, and at around 50% crit, adding more crit has about half the effect on flurry uptime that it does at around 25% crit. Certainly less, but I wouldnt describe it as 'ineffective'. At around 50% crit, 1% more crit works out to just under 1% more flurry uptime I think (as in 1% of total time, not 1% current uptime, ie. from something like 84% uptime to 85% uptime), which isnt too shabby (in contrast, at around 25% crit adding 1% more crit is more on the order of 2% more flurry uptime).<br>
<br>
Also, although flurry will generally be up 'most of the time', this most of the time generally works out to 70-80% (a bit more at higher levels of gear, and should go up once OH WW can proc it), not 90%+ like many assume. There is still significant gains to be made by increasing that.<br>
<br>
------<br>
<br>
Also, as an addendum, I'm thinking of making a flurry simulator (most likely a simple C program rather than a spreadsheet, as it's a little more complicated to model) and I could do with knowing a few things - firstly, do WF attacks consume flurry? I assume that they can proc it, but as a hit that generates rage, I don't know if they can consume a flurry charge or not. Also, is there a consistent view on what happens to the swing speed of your weapon when flurry runs out halfway through (normally due to a swing from the different weapon) - does it just carry on as if the weapon speed was normal, or if it was flurried, or does it 'flurry half the swing' and then leave the rest normal?</div>

 i'm currently using a slow/fast(syphon and swiftsteel bludgeon) i'm kinda convinced on trying to take the next axe of najentus that drops so i can try out the slow/slow<br>

My question right now is should i just stick to my syphon MH bludgeon OH - or should i use my dragonstrike as a MH and spyhon as an OH so i have two slow weapon....  or is the difference minimal and the stats on the swiftsteel bludgeon worthy of just using that for now.</div>

		<div id="post_message_570038">I realise I made a slight error in my earlier maths, by counting 3 rather than 4 attacks (ie. ignoring instants). Here's the simple maths I did at work the other day - it's hard to be entirely accurate with flurry, since the more flurry you have the less instants per 3-hit cycle you have which complicates things.<br>
<br>
Anyway, 2 slow weapons, and BT every 6 seconds and WW every 9, you're looking at around 1 instant for every 3 melee hits, which means that the formula for flurry uptime is (approximately) 1-((1-C)^4).<br>
<br>
Putting in some sample crit rates (C) you get the following flurry uptimes:<br>

Critrate ---- Flurry uptime<br>
25% ---- 68.4%<br>
30% ---- 76%<br>
35% ---- 82.1%<br>
40% ---- 87%<br>
45% ---- 90.8%<br>
50% ---- 93.8%<br>
<br>
so, going from 25%-&gt;30% crit (an increase of 5%) gives around an 8% increase in flurry uptime<br>
going from 45% to 50% (also an increase of 5)%, gives around a 3% increase in flurry uptime<br>
<br>
This is only approximate though - in fact you'll normally have a bit less than 4 attacks per 3-melee hits (particularly if you use a fast offhand), which will reduce the difference more so that at higher levels of crit you will gain a bigger distance in flurry uptimes. Then again, if WF hits can proc flurry but not eat it, then you will have even more attacks per 3-melee swings.<br>
<br>
I'll try to work on this flurry simulator over the next week or so and see if I can get some more accurate data.</div>

Take a no impale situation. You have C% crit, and S% of your damage is from specials.<br>
<br>
Of your specials, C% are crits, hitting for double damage. This means that 2*C/(1+C) of your special damage is from crits. Impale means you do 0.1*S*C/(1+C) S more damage. For most fury warriors, special damage is around 50% I think (probably higher at higher gear levels as you can HS more). Taking 40% crit, that makes a dps increase of:<br>
<br>
0.1*0.5*0.4/1.4 = 0.0143 or 1.4% more damage from Impale. Hmm, less than I expected, but still more than 1%, and it will increase as your yellow damage increases. Just looked at a couple of Teron Gorefiend logs, one was an MS warrior with 70% special damage, another was a DW Fury with 60% special damage, both of which push impale up before you even count increased crit. Still, it's certainly interesting how little it is - I guess it's due to the fact that it's 20% of the critical strike bonus damage rather than 20% of the whole hit (or at least that's what I'm lead to believe).</div>

Just change out the number that it's raised to (^3) to something that approximates your total number of swings per 3 white hits. Short story is that past 30% crit the amount of flurry uptime contributed by the next 1% crit drops off a lot, so you don't see as drastic of gains from Crit as you do up until that point.</div>

</div>Exactly.  I sub in HS when my rage is over 80, as that allows for a full cost HS + 1 slam + MS with 20 rage leftover to guarantee being able to hit slam before my auto attack and have enough rage for WW assuming my auto doesn't crit.  This has more than once left me with ~27 rage, WW on cooldown and unable to hit MS though...  Probably a bad practice to do it less than 85 rage.</div>

</div>Quick spreadsheet numbers using my current gear(+wf, buffs, unleased, ect) Theoretical Max dps<br>
EDIT: Wrong numbers<br>
17/44: 1538.9 dps + deep wounds<br>
3/44/14: 1520.4 dps<br>
<br>
Realistically you might be looking at 5% less dps? That number doesnt feel quite right though.<br>
<br>
More fiddling with talents with Imp execute got me thinking. <br>
1. Execute is set damage, it doesnt scale with anything but crit, expertise, and Armor Pen. <br>
2. Execute will use all your rage, which making using HS while using execute very hard.<br>
<br>
I'm wondering what the point of inflection is where it is more dps to just not execute. BT already outscales execute at about T4/T5 level, when would the combination of WW and HS be more dps than execute for the rest of the GCDs?</div>

</div>I used the dps warrior spreadsheet and found that 44/17 was a small dps loss vs 17/44 (around 4% IIRC), factoring in the defiance bonus. This seems to line up with most theorycrafting here (deep wounds being ~3-4%, impale being 1-2%, and 6 expertise being a straight 1.5% increase).<br>
<br>
Is 4% dps worth the survival advantage of last stand and tanking advantage of imp shield block and toughness/defiance? That's the question every warrior will have to make for himself.</div>

Solarian's Sapphire = 70 Attack power<br>

70 ap x commanding presence's 25 percent = 87.5ap<br>
<br>
87.5ap x unleashed rage's 10 percent = 96.25ap<br>
<br>
96.25 ap x 5 melee in the group = 481.25 total ap from everyone in the group. I hope i worded that right. Thats 481 total ap that group didnt have before the trinket. <br>

Is that math correct? If so i can definately see the huge raid benefit you get from it coupled with blood frenzy debuff.<br>

<br>
If all this math is correct then i have one question. If you total up all 5 of the melee's ap without that 481 added to the total and then add it to it. How much would that honestly help dps wise? I guess what im trying to ask. IS there anyway to tell how much dps is being gained by the 481ap total from all 5 people.</div>

		<div id="post_message_575869">I honestly don't think 400 extra ap (with unleashed rage and 5/5 commanding presence) from 4 melees (not counting yourself) is deciding anything in any raid. How much percent of damage would this be for the raid - like nearly nothing? Though perhaps the 300 extra life can save your life, so you can make some extra decent dps to the end of the bossfight that could be important.<br>
<br>
Sorry for the bad joke, but I honestly don't think, that this trinket is anywhere "good" or nearly "the best". With 30 Stamina on it, it has the opposite stat any warrior needs on a class trinket. And it is a affront to every warrior who doesn't wants to be pushed in the "you-are-only-a-supporter"-role. It's a trinket, many people force them selves to wear, because it's "the best" in bare numbers. <br>
<br>
Just wear what you like to wear, and don't force yourself to wear this bad-designed "class trinket". Saying this, I will stay with DST/TT until I get a real upgrade.<br>

In a raid scenario raid DPS is alway about maximizing results. But(!) why do warriors get the grp-buff trinket? I mean rogues alway get pure personal DPS class trinkets. Why not give them something useful that increases grp/raid DPS?  <br>
<br>
It seems warriors are put into a buff/debuff role and rogues only provide dmg (3-click-rotation... woheee). They provide no other useful incentive... <br>
<br>
<br>
The think is, where are  warriors heading? <br>
I hope with the -10% threat we can sustain our DPS output. Rouges will be in 1st spot by default of course (blizz said that) but maybe we can compete for #2-3 spot against warlocks and mages.<br>
Btw anybody seen a rogue without a warrior ap-shout <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302190653im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/wink.gif" border="0" alt="" title=";)" class="inlineimg"> ? I noticed on early vashj kill, how their dps went down down down when no totems/LoP/BS were uppon them, because they were running around in phase2 (before we optimized positioning).<br>
<br>
As some also mentioned BT/Hyal bosses have less armor, so we will see decreasing DPS numbers in Sunwell, I guess. Unless -armor stacks even more on T7.</div>

		<div id="post_message_576081">As soon as another trinket can provide the raid DPS increase that the sapphire does then yeah, of course one should want to change it.  But I don't see that coming soon at all...  Like someone said earlier, your battle shout is responsible for a lot of the rogue's damage: perhaps around 50DPS per group member.  <br>
<br>
It is interesting that rogues have never buffed the group in any way (except perhaps for hemo, but that's hardly seen due to it's impracticality), but then again, the whole melee group is based around buffing the rogues.  But look at it from this point of view: <br>
<br>
The typical setup of warrior, shaman, druid, 2x rogues usually ends up in the following on the DPS meters (with DPS stats from a random Anetheron kill):<br>
Rogue #1 - 1770DPS<br>
Rogue #2 - 1630DPS<br>
Warrior - 1470DPS<br>
Druid - 1450DPS<br>
Shaman - 1430DPS<br>
<br>
We're usually the top 5, depending on the encounter.  If we can assume that the battle shout adds at least 50DPS per group member AND Blood Frenzy debuff adds around 200-250 DPS (I have actually done napkin math on this but I can't find it and can't be bothered to do it again just now) spread throughout the raid then the warrior contributed to the raid with around 1870-1920 DPS whereas the rogues only did what shows on the meters.  I'm not too fussed about our DPS and raid position once I look at it from this point of view, tbh. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302190653im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":)" class="inlineimg"></div>

</div>It can, but probably it never will be. We are speaking about 400 AP for the whole raid (we are speaking about the support-ap not the personal ap, so not counting the warrior - the warrior himself would make more DPS with another trinket. In my case TT delivers ~25 DPS more than SS) . Nothing more.<br>
<br>
But anyway I'am not talking about egoism here. I'm simply talking about forcing to wear yourself a trinket, that IS bad designed, having alternatives like DST, TT or MOTB. You would kick a player out of your guild, when he doesn't LIKE to wear this, I won't, because this trinket isn't deciding in most of the time, or even the whole time. WoW isn't just about "best numbers" it's also about fun - since this is true, your arguments aren't ultimate. Just my opinion.</div>

</div>This holds true for any item individually. Is the Sapphire over the DST likely to make the difference between a wipe and a kill? Probably not. Is T5 chest over T4 chest likely to make the difference between a wipe and a kill? No, probably not, but you'd still wear it because it's an upgrade. When you add 10 'small chances to make a difference', you get 1 big chance to make a difference. The fact still is that Solarian's sapphire makes more of a difference than any other trinket, perhaps more than any other item. It's *insanely* good.<br>
<br>
Is it good design that this one trinket is so good it will never be replaced in the whole of TBC? No, probably not. They made it a bit too good (like the pre-nerf DST, which they realised and changed). Whether they'll nerf the sapphire I don't know, but whilst we have it, if we want to do our best, we should use it.<br>
<br>
If you would rather wear a 'cooler' trinket because you like it, that's fine. I have (on occasion) worn items that were worse than others I had, simply because 'they looked cooler'. I got the Arena S2 shoulders months ago, because I liked how good they are. I could probably have gotten a couple of small upgrades since then (nothing major), but I'd rather keep these because they look good. However, I'm not going to go to a theorycraft forum, which discusses how best to play a DPS warrior, and claim that they are better than the alternatives:<br>

</div>Yes, I apologize for saying this. Anyway I always accepted that this trinket delivers the most dps for the entire raid.<br>
<br>
But I'm only talking about this trinket. I'm talking about this, because I don't like this trinket and I don't want to wear it until WoW comes to an end - I don't think any trinket only concerning personal DPS can replace this, even lvl 80 epic trinket's probably won't. So you want to wear it "forever"? This trinket just provokes this thoughts.</div>

</div>But you neglect that the warrior makes use of the trinket himself. Under the right conditions, it's a static 106ap alone to a fury warrior. Compare that to BBrooch, or Tsunami, or even DST. Keep in mind the BBrooch has a static ap equivalent of roughly the same, and the procs on the other 2 have hidden c/ds.<br>
Alone, it's very comparable to your other options. The breaking point, obviously, is the 96ap to 4 other people.</div>

</div>Even though I did not expect it, I came to the same conclusion before. The thing is though that for a lot of DPS warriors, the off-tier epics will be a lot easier to acquire simply because there is no competition for them (worst case, 1 other dps warrior, but how many guilds are really running with two?) and the Tier items are best in slot for the other classes you share it with. 4 pieces of T6 and Silent Justice gloves came out just ahead of other combination for me a while ago, but not enough to actually prioritize it for me and hold out on any off-tier items dropping that could buff my dps instantly. So what I decided to do is just get all the off-tier that drops for me and by the time everyone has their Tier items, I start collecting the onslaught pieces I need.</div>

		<div id="post_message_576412">Hey there EJ, I'm looking for a little advice about my warrior, Trollblade. This character is an alt, but an alt I sometimes use on lower raids such as Gruul and Kara (which the WWS is for).<br>
 <br>
Obligatory WWS Parse: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302190658/http://wowwebstats.com/k3ijlzwgsxrai" target="_blank">Wow Web Stats</a><br>
 <br>
There's a couple places I can instantly improve a little damage via spec (say dropping Improved Execute for Weapon Mastery and finally getting Mongoose for my Main Hand), but byeond that I'm at a loss on why my DPS is so low. I was only doing about 600 DPS on Gruul even though I had Windfury Totem. <br>
 <br>
Stats (battle stance):<br>
1622 Attack Power (remember that I have Darkmoon Card though)<br>
28.58% Crit<br>
199 Hit Rating<br>
 <br>
Armory Link: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302190658/http://www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Garona&amp;n=Trollblade" target="_blank">The World of Warcraft Armory</a><br>
 <br>
What am I doing wrong DPS-wise?<br>
 <br>
As I understand it, the key to DPS is to use these powers in this order:<br>
 <br>
1) If the target is below 20% HP, use Execute.<br>
2) If Bloodthirst is up, use it.<br>
3) If bloodthirst is not up, use WW.<br>
4) If BT and WW are not up, and you have more than 50 Rage, use Heroic Strike.<br>
 <br>
That's been my goal when DPS'ing, and I've been able to get above 3500 Attack Power with my gear and with Windfury is pretty fantastic, but I can't believe that I am doing such low DPS. Pointers?</div>

</div>Indeed, regemming is an issue I found. I actually gemmed my stuff before reading some FAQs here on these boards and have been too lazy to spend the money just for BoK benefits. It *is* on my to-do list though.<br>
 <br>
I didnt really notice being rage starved though - I was able to Bloodthirst and WW every time they were up as I recall, especially with Windfury and Cave Ins giving me rage.<br>

BT at +9 Sec, +17, +24, so about on average 9, 8, 7 seconds respectively. Obviously more than 6 seconds between each, but I think GCD was nuking me each time. <br>
WW happened at +11, +21, so about 10 between the first two.<br>
 <br>
Would WWS report lower DPS from time spent moving back into position from Ground Stomp?<br>

Looks like I'm getting a lot of glancing.</div>

Other classes are playing with their specs (Hemo in a raid-situation for example), I want to swap my support-trinket for a personal dps-trinket. It kinda depends on your raid and on the other players, but what I've read in the forums is, that many players try something new after they killed Illidan, so why shouldn't we?</div>

</div>You're completely right. For some reason I hadn't realized you have two fights in that report. If you want help like this, it would probably be more helpful if you would post a WWS of a fight with better becnhmarking qualities. Although considering the situation you're in with your warrior being an alt I wouldn't really be able to say which one that would be.<br>

</div>Because if you take that Madness over a rogue right now for selfish reasons, that rogue won't be using it on the encounters in Sunwell when you will be using your Sapphire again. Besides, even though changing your loot focus from serving the greater good towards raiding towards serving yourself can technically be considered 'trying something new', I would hardly throw it on the same pile as respeccing and using completely diffirent abilities for a change of pace.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Indeed, regemming is an issue I found. I actually gemmed my stuff before reading some FAQs here on these boards and have been too lazy to spend the money just for BoK benefits. It *is* on my to-do list though.<br>
 <br>
I didnt really notice being rage starved though - I was able to Bloodthirst and WW every time they were up as I recall, especially with Windfury and Cave Ins giving me rage.<br>
 <br>
Filtered WWS Report: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302190658/http://wowwebstats.com/k3ijlzwgsxrai?s=61-416&amp;bl=0&amp;fia=6&amp;fiaa=i&amp;fit=0&amp;fih=7&amp;fih=8&amp;fih=5&amp;fih=3&amp;fih=6&amp;fih=0&amp;fih=1&amp;fih=2" target="_blank">Wow Web Stats</a><br>
 <br>
BT at +9 Sec, +17, +24, so about on average 9, 8, 7 seconds respectively. Obviously more than 6 seconds between each, but I think GCD was nuking me each time. <br>
WW happened at +11, +21, so about 10 between the first two.<br>
 <br>
Would WWS report lower DPS from time spent moving back into position from Ground Stomp?<br>
 <br>
Looks like I'm getting a lot of glancing.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</div>I wanna start by saying that I'm still leveling my DPS warrior, but I've read a lot of theorycraft and done Gruul many times <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302190658im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":)" class="inlineimg"><br>
<br>
I think you were onto something though when you mentioned when you used your bloodthirsts and whirlwinds.  <br>
<br>
At 4:10:24 you WW, at 4:10:27 you Bloodthirst, looks like there is a ground slam and shatter around 4:10:39, then you get back on top of Gruul at 4:10:41.  Then your next Bloodthirst is over 4 seconds later at 4:10:45, then WW at 4:10:47.  All there is between the shatter and that Bloodthirst is white damage, seems to me like you should have been able to WW or Bloodthirst earlier than that?  It also seems like you could have slid in another WW at 4:10:33 before you ran out for the ground slam?<br>
<br>
I know its easier said than done, but I've these are the kinda things I wanna have figured out by the time I hit 70, gotta show my rogue friends who is boss :P</div>

</div>You could lose some hit otherwise a solid set of gear. Replacing the Kara ring will be a start. Also, consider executioner on your MH and getting a slow OH.<br>
<br>
And imp tc vs iron will since you will, in all likelihood, will be doing off-tanking from time to time.<br>

And if no other warrior has it, Piercing Howl and 2/5 Imp Demo shout as are handy to have and easy for a Fury warrior to keep up.</div>

		<div id="post_message_577711">Since the haste nerf, there is generally just one 'best' off-tier item for each slot in MH/BT and that is the one that simply doesn't have haste on it. Get them whenever they drop for you, because they will all be better than what you have and if you happen to run into any stat-deficiencies (most likely +hit) then simply apply a temporary stopgap by regemming or eating +hit food until you get the key +hit pieces. Depending on your loot system, you can also go for T6 pieces, but as mentioned before, it is preferable to most people to just get the lesser-contented off-tier loot that is almost as good or better until you get the set bonuses of T6 working for you. It will also help out the classes you share a token with and your warrior tanks. For weapons what you have is pretty solid already, maybe a blade of infamy for your OH would be a small upgrade, check the spreadsheet I'd say.<br>
<br>
In the mean time, remove those +hit gems from your gear and replace them with +crit or crit/str. And buying a wad of arcane tomes from the AH to get your Aldor rep to exalted for a decent shoulder enchant should help aswell.<br>
<br>
Also, is it me or does not a single warrior in your guild have points in improved demo? If you want to make yourself really useful, get 5/5 and make one of your locks start putting CoR on bosses.</div>

</div>I believe Allcom and the other people involved have been looking to make it compatible with OpenOffice for a while now. IF it doesn't work, try reading the Spreadsheet's thread and see if there's anything you can enable or disable to make it work or that you simply need to install Excel. <br>
<br>
As for hit: 15% hitrating is probably way too much. If you want to get to the core of the theorycraft you would have to read a few dozen pages back in this thread, but it has to do with the fact that after you reach 9% total +hit, any more of it would only affect your white hits and not your special attacks anymore. Meaning that it loses close to half of its benefit to you. Extra hitrating also benefits the predictability of your rage generation and any proc effects, but it doesn't weigh up to the damage +crit adds to all melee attacks made. <br>
<br>
The current trend is that you just make sure you have your olde 9% +hit so you don't miss any specials (including precision) and once you do stop gemming any +hit at all. As soon as you can afford it due to receiving extra itemized +hit, replace any +hit gems you did have to get to 9% with crit or str/crit ones. If you happen to get +hit because it's itemized into a superior item, that's fine though. <br>
<br>
Right now I actually find myself wondering if there would ever be a situation where you would consider speccing out of precision. I know mages do it with their hitrating talent.</div>

The build just allows enough points to get all the worthwhile talents in both trees.</div>

</div>Using the spreadsheet shows that 3/3 in precision is worth more total dps than 2/2 Imp Execute+1/3 Precision and 1/2 Imp exec.+2/3 Precision. Speccing out of Imp WW totally is a bad idea, it will ruin your cycle. Precision is an excellent talent even after reaching 9% hit. Sure, it's not as good as Weapon Mastery but imo (and in the spreadsheet) it beats Imp. Execute by a fair margin. 9% is not the hit cap, 28% is, it's not until you reach 28% that hit is pointless. (Yeah I know that crit/str/whatever is better on gear, but now we're discussing talents).<br>
<br>
I already changed to a 47/14 fury/prot build actually. Feels nice to be able to take all those talents in fury tree. Even though the defiance change is not in yet I still managed to keep my dps at roughly the same level as before. It's of course hard to tell just comparing 2 different raids, but I didn't feel gimped at all. Estimates from the spreadsheet shows a loss of 3-5% going from 17/44/0 to 0/47/14, seems reasonable to me. The great thing about the build is the added survivability. Having Last Stand and +10% armor enabled me to tank Nalorakk for the last 3% yesterday in fury gear+shield, it saved a certain wipe for us. Must say that I really like the build. Will be even more fun when Defiance starts to work in zerk stance.<br>
<br>
To Infernox, make a post in the spreadsheet thread about your OpenOffice problems, I could probably help you make it work (or I could upload my OO version of it). The reason why it dies when you try to start it is likely the scripts, they need to be disabled if you want it to work.</div>

</div>This is a simulated result from a simulator. It may be flawed but I didn't found any bug based on my own understanding.<br>
<br>
Based on a random generator for Crit/Miss/Dodge etc, you will always have different dps show on a certain fight with a short peroid of time. However, if you run the simulator long enough, they always align to a certain DPS value.<br>
<br>
And you can found that I only started the simulator for 6min which is not long enough for anything.<br>
<br>
I just want to say the defiance build is workable as a DPS and off-tanking build for myself.</div>

		<div id="post_message_579123">To start off I'm a 33/28/0 warrior who is usually the only dps warrior in our raids.  What I am curious about is how much armor penetration is too much? Right now due to poor drops besides my tier set I'm wearing 5/5 tier6.  I planned on using either the <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304081021/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=32341"><span  ><span class="purplename">[Leggings of Divine Retribution]</span></span></a> or <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304081021/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=30903"><span  ><span class="purplename">[Legguards of Endless Rage]</span></span></a> or <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304081021/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=32278"><span  ><span class="purplename">[Grips of Silent Justice]</span></span></a>.  My problem is my crit is so low due to wearing all this gear with no crit rating and agility.  Also I socketed the way I did due to the fact that my crit rating is already very low and we have no spinels in the bank and I might as well make use of our Pyrestones(don't ask about the blue gems, guild has a one epic gem per piece of loot regardless of sockets)  <br>
<br>
My main question is how low of a crit percentage is too low? I'm sitting at 31% zerker raid buffed.  And how much armor penetration is appropriate is wear over crit %. I have the <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304081021/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=33474"><span  ><span class="purplename">[Ancient Sin'dorei Longbow]</span></span></a> but the merc war-edge gives .72% crit and losing that drops me down to 28.77% in zerker unbuffed. Which off piece should I use?  Also 4 piece seems incredibly unimpressive and I wonder if it would be better to use some off pieces over it. The problem I run into is dropping below the hit cap with the some of the offpieces(Bloodboil legs) or losing the armor pen on that piece.<br>

		<div id="post_message_579212"><div align="left">I have been making heavy use of the Warrior DPS spreadsheets as my Warrior transitions from 17/44 DW to 21/40 or 20/41 2h fury-imp slam. I have a few questions, but I think it might be better to outline the assumptions I am working under first. <br>
<br>
1) We have illidan on farm status, so personal e-peen growth is more legitimate at this point than it ever would have been previously (Re: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304081021/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=30446" target="_blank">Solarian's Sapphire - Items - World of Warcraft</a> versus <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304081021/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=32505" target="_blank">Madness of the Betrayer - Items - World of Warcraft</a>) <br>
<br>
2) We run melee-light raids, generally our build is 2 to 3 rogues, myself, a feral druid, and an enh shaman. <br>
<br>
     The prevalent spec for Warriors in T6 with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304081021/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=30902" target="_blank">Cataclysm's Edge - Items - World of Warcraft</a> seems to be 33/28 MS / Flurry w/blood frenzy. The overall raid damage boost from BF is undeniable, and in terms of absolute maximum raid dps I have a feeling that for the only dps warrior in the raid, BF and Solarian trinket is probably the way to go. However, If I am talking about pure personal dps in T6 instances, there are a few questions I have unresolved: <br>
<br>
<b>1) </b><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304081021/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=30106" target="_blank">Belt of One-Hundred Deaths - Items - World of Warcraft</a> <b>versus</b> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304081021/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=30032" target="_blank">Red Belt of Battle - Items - World of Warcraft</a><br>
 <br>
     If I understand the mechanics of expertise correctly, the 6 expertise I gain from the Vashj belt vastly outweighs the hit on RBoB, the crit is similar, and AP is inferior, but not to the point where I see it as a huge problem. So... is this belt a viable high end warrior option? If so, im going to dig it out of my bank and gem it up. (If this can be resolved using the spreadsheet, my apologies. I am pretty bad with excel and couldn't answer this question myself) <br>
<br>
<b>2) </b><b>Deathwish Versus Rampage for 2H fury.</b> <br>
<br>
     Reading through the Warrior posts I have seen some varying opinions on this one. My feeling is that since Rampage must be reapplied on a regular basis and really screws up the rotation ( At least for me, wearing the 38 haste garbage trash gloves, trash haste ring, and a dst ) and deathwish is only a marginal theoretical dps decrease, I might stick with deathwish. If there is any real theorycraft to refute this that I havn't managed to find here, a link would be much appreciated. <br>
<br>
<b>3) </b><b>Armor penetration, effective scaling, and the use or lack thereof of DPS Warrior T6</b><br>
<br>
     At high end there are some difficult decisions to make with warrior itemization. It is fairly simple to plug these items into the spreadsheet and see what yields the highest dps, but the spreadsheets seem to ignore the scaling value of armor penetration. I read somewhere that the spreadsheet will model it correctly given a few resets, but I cannot seem to get it to work. Warrior T6 seems like a slightly lackluster dps set relative to the value of 4/5 T6 to the pure dps classes, and DPS warriors also have quite a large range of off-set items with high Ilvl and decent stat allocation... so:<br>
<br>
     -Do I wear 4/5 tier 6 at all, or use a combination of the offset DPS plate pieces.<br>
     -If yes to 4piece T6, which piece do I sacrifice for the one (often superior) offset piece that I can wear?<br>
     -Assuming static armor penetration of  685 from my other gear, w/ potential procs from Madness of the betrayer and executioner, does <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304081021/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=30903" target="_blank">Legguards of Endless Rage - Items - World of Warcraft</a> get outweighed by the scaling value of armor penetration on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304081021/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=32341" target="_blank">Leggings of Divine Retribution - Items - World of Warcraft</a> or do I simply wear T6 legs and use a different slot for my offset piece. <br>
<br>
<b>4) </b><b>How much hit is the right amount (ie: the cap, for 2h, with 3 of 3 precision )</b><br>
<br>
     The value I see across the board and on the accepted notions of theorycrafting post is 143 for 1h shield  and 2h, but I have not found a post that lists the cap if you are specced into precision with a 2hander. I am not sure if I am just reading this wrong, or whether everyone just specs arms and doesnt care, or whether there is some basic math here that I do not understand. Anyways, there it is. <br>
<br>
     I am a little tired at the moment and if I have dragged on or repeated myself or asked questions that have easily accessible answers that I was simply too lazy to find, I apologize. Similarly, I know questions about item choices are sometimes frowned on. My justification here is simply that the theory behind these item comparisons is interesting for some warriors that can extend the principles behind these item comparisons to their own gear and spec. 20/41 and 21/40 are fairly rare specs from what I have researched, so information is a little sparse. Also, I couldnt figure out how to tag items to show wowhead stats on mouseover, so please excuse the links =/.</div><br>
Thanks for reading<br>

</div>I specced 20/41 like 2 months back for Hyjal one day. Keeping up Rampage between the slam rotation was a total headache, it's impossible to keep up without breaking the rotation. If I went 2H fury again I would probably go 21/40 even if it is less damage (I'm not sure if it is or how big the difference is) just because timing a Slam rotation and keeping good uptime on Rampage for 4 hours felt a bit draining. One thing I did notice was that the Slam rotation was a lot tighter with 5/5 flurry and I was using 3.8 speed <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304081021/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=28442"><span  ><span class="purplename">[Stormherald]</span></span></a>. With a 3.5 speed <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304081021/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=30902"><span  ><span class="purplename">[Cataclysm's Edge]</span></span></a> the Slam rotation will be very tight. It's still above the theoretical minimum 2.5 second swing timer needed for a proper swing rotation, but close enough that latency/brain lag may give you problems.<br>
<br>
Calculating the hit % needed to reach cap is pretty easy, 1% hit at level 70 is 15.8 hit rating and against level 73 or boss level mobs the chance to miss is 9%. If you get 3/3 precision, you'll need 95 hit rating to hit cap (6 * 15.8 = 94.8. Always round up so 95) but you'll probably only want to put max 2 points in to precision, if not less or none if you're already at 9% hit.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic"><div align="left">I have been making heavy use of the Warrior DPS spreadsheets as my Warrior transitions from 17/44 DW to 21/40 or 20/41 2h fury-imp slam. I have a few questions, but I think it might be better to outline the assumptions I am working under first. <br>
<br>
1) We have illidan on farm status, so personal e-peen growth is more legitimate at this point than it ever would have been previously (Re: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304081021/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=30446" target="_blank">Solarian's Sapphire - Items - World of Warcraft</a> versus <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304081021/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=32505" target="_blank">Madness of the Betrayer - Items - World of Warcraft</a>) <br>
<br>
2) We run melee-light raids, generally our build is 2 to 3 rogues, myself, a feral druid, and an enh shaman. <br>
<br>
     The prevalent spec for Warriors in T6 with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304081021/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=30902" target="_blank">Cataclysm's Edge - Items - World of Warcraft</a> seems to be 33/28 MS / Flurry w/blood frenzy. The overall raid damage boost from BF is undeniable, and in terms of absolute maximum raid dps I have a feeling that for the only dps warrior in the raid, BF and Solarian trinket is probably the way to go. However, If I am talking about pure personal dps in T6 instances, there are a few questions I have unresolved: <br>
<br>
<b>1) </b><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304081021/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=30106" target="_blank">Belt of One-Hundred Deaths - Items - World of Warcraft</a> <b>versus</b> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304081021/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=30032" target="_blank">Red Belt of Battle - Items - World of Warcraft</a><br>
 <br>
     If I understand the mechanics of expertise correctly, the 6 expertise I gain from the Vashj belt vastly outweighs the hit on RBoB, the crit is similar, and AP is inferior, but not to the point where I see it as a huge problem. So... is this belt a viable high end warrior option? If so, im going to dig it out of my bank and gem it up. (If this can be resolved using the spreadsheet, my apologies. I am pretty bad with excel and couldn't answer this question myself) <br>
<br>
<b>2) </b><b>Deathwish Versus Rampage for 2H fury.</b> <br>
<br>
     Reading through the Warrior posts I have seen some varying opinions on this one. My feeling is that since Rampage must be reapplied on a regular basis and really screws up the rotation ( At least for me, wearing the 38 haste garbage trash gloves, trash haste ring, and a dst ) and deathwish is only a marginal theoretical dps decrease, I might stick with deathwish. If there is any real theorycraft to refute this that I havn't managed to find here, a link would be much appreciated. <br>
<br>
<b>3) </b><b>Armor penetration, effective scaling, and the use or lack thereof of DPS Warrior T6</b><br>
<br>
     At high end there are some difficult decisions to make with warrior itemization. It is fairly simple to plug these items into the spreadsheet and see what yields the highest dps, but the spreadsheets seem to ignore the scaling value of armor penetration. I read somewhere that the spreadsheet will model it correctly given a few resets, but I cannot seem to get it to work. Warrior T6 seems like a slightly lackluster dps set relative to the value of 4/5 T6 to the pure dps classes, and DPS warriors also have quite a large range of off-set items with high Ilvl and decent stat allocation... so:<br>
<br>
     -Do I wear 4/5 tier 6 at all, or use a combination of the offset DPS plate pieces.<br>
     -If yes to 4piece T6, which piece do I sacrifice for the one (often superior) offset piece that I can wear?<br>
     -Assuming static armor penetration of  685 from my other gear, w/ potential procs from Madness of the betrayer and executioner, does <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304081021/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=30903" target="_blank">Legguards of Endless Rage - Items - World of Warcraft</a> get outweighed by the scaling value of armor penetration on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304081021/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=32341" target="_blank">Leggings of Divine Retribution - Items - World of Warcraft</a> or do I simply wear T6 legs and use a different slot for my offset piece. <br>
<br>
<b>4) </b><b>How much hit is the right amount (ie: the cap, for 2h, with 3 of 3 precision )</b><br>
<br>
     The value I see across the board and on the accepted notions of theorycrafting post is 143 for 1h shield  and 2h, but I have not found a post that lists the cap if you are specced into precision with a 2hander. I am not sure if I am just reading this wrong, or whether everyone just specs arms and doesnt care, or whether there is some basic math here that I do not understand. Anyways, there it is. <br>
<br>
     I am a little tired at the moment and if I have dragged on or repeated myself or asked questions that have easily accessible answers that I was simply too lazy to find, I apologize. Similarly, I know questions about item choices are sometimes frowned on. My justification here is simply that the theory behind these item comparisons is interesting for some warriors that can extend the principles behind these item comparisons to their own gear and spec. 20/41 and 21/40 are fairly rare specs from what I have researched, so information is a little sparse. Also, I couldnt figure out how to tag items to show wowhead stats on mouseover, so please excuse the links =/.</div><br>
Thanks for reading<br>

</div>1) Belt of the One-Hundred Deaths is insane and about the only thing that would make me go back to ssc for.<br>
<br>
2) 2h Fury just isn't a strong build to begin with and there has been some theory on it just not sure where. Dropping rampage sort of already weakens the build before you start but it is definately an effort to keep up in low rage situations. Given a choice I would take DW over rampage too just for ease of use.<br>
<br>
3) 4 piece tier 6 is very lackluster and not something I'd aim for unless the gear was going for cheap. The best set up seems to be tier 6 shoulders + one other, most likely chest. Stick a blue gem in the shoulders and one more in your belt and fill the rest up with str gems. Cursed vision of Sargeras, Silent Justice and Divine Retribution make up your other 3 slots. Would be hard pressed to find a better combination.<br>
    As for armour penetration its probably going to give you the biggest increase in dps over straight ap and at some point also crit. Also has the added benefit of the more you get the better it becomes. <br>
<br>
4) As mikebro said, 9% hit is what you need for any 2hand spec. For dw its more but past 9% you lose half its value.</div>

		<div id="post_message_579569">Hey, I just wanted to ask the DPS Warrior community a few questions regarding 2H MS (3/5 flurry) DPS.<br>
<br>
<br>
Okay, so I know the general 2h DPS cycle is Auto--&gt; Slam--&gt; Instant... but since 2h rage generation is so volatile, I am very rarely able to follow a rigid cycle, like a DW Fury Warrior. I lack experience DPSing with a 2H, so I'd like to pose a situations where I am unsure as what the best course of action would be. <br>
<br>
I use a Cataclysm's Edge (3.5 speed // 3.0 flurried)<br>
<br>
1. [80 Rage] Auto Attack--&gt; Slam--&gt; Mortal Strike--&gt;?<br>
Swing Timer:_______________0_______1.5_______3.0<br>
<br>
So I start off with 80 rage before the auto attack, and then I go through the DPS cycle once. At this point in time, I feel I have two options: Wait for an auto attack and slam, or Whirlwind and skip slam. I'm tempted to whirlwind because it doesn't reset my swing timer and I'm eager to put it on cooldown so I can use it again sooner. Should I wait for the auto attack or Whirlwind? Also, if I do whirlwind, should I still slam (swing timer should be at 1.5s since the last auto attack hit).<br>
<br>
<br>
2. Auto Attack--&gt; Slam--&gt;? [30 rage]<br>
<br>
In this scenario, I'm left with 30 rage 2/3 of the way into the cycle. I can either use mortal strike now and start a new cycle with 0 rage, or skip using an instant for this cycle and use it on the next cycle. I've found out that I seem to be able to slam sooner after an auto attack if I already I have &gt;15 rage before the auto attack hits, rather than spamming slam while waiting for the rage from the auto attack. <br>
<br>
3. Do you guys chain slam or use heroic strike when your rage is, or nearly is, full?</div>

<br>
It seems like I'm pulled into combat by our MT, so that kills my charge.  I don't have the rage to use Intercept, so i resort to hacking on the target with White attacks.  Meanwhile, the Hunters and Rogues are going crazy on the DPS. I glance at Damage Meter and I have just a little more DPS than the tank does.<br>
<br>
Crap.<br>
<br>
<br>
I can always hit Bloodrage, which gives me an extra 10, which is enough to get my white hit started, but that seems like it.</div>

</div>Slam then whirlwind. It's not worth missing a slam to use WW 1.5 seconds sooner, unless you're rage starved you'll be losing out on overall DPS. A slam should do more damage than a whirlwind and only costs you .5 seconds of white DPS time.<br>

</div>If you have a high ping, it may be more effective to save 15 rage to be ready to hit a slam. In practice, however, I find mashing slam while waiting for the white swing to not waste too much time with around ~200 ping, plus it's impossible to clip your white attack in this situation. However, this shouldn't happen unless you go a long period of time with no white crits or WF procs.<br>

</div>Spamming slam would be a special attack every 1.5 seconds. Using a white-&gt;Special-&gt;slam rotation with a 3.0 speed attack, you get about 3 attacks every 3.5 seconds, which is more attacks and damage per second. You'll definitely get more DPS out of just sticking with a normal rotation unless both MS and WW are on cooldown, in which you might replace a normal cycle with slam until an instant comes up again, if you have the rage. White-&gt;Slam with no special would be 2 attacks every 3.5 seconds, slam spam would be 2 attacks every 3 seconds until a special came back up.<br>
<br>
When it comes to heroic strike, I find myself rarely using it as 33/28, except when I'm actually at 100 rage. While making sure the attack can't glance is nice, you lose out on 15 rage, plus whatever rage you would have gained from the white attack (20-40?). Hence the damage per rage conversion is atrocious (35-55 rage for ~200 more damage?), and more importantly, it can leave you in that #2 situation where you can't cast slam until the server registers your rage gain from a white attack.</div>

</div>I'd use MS, as soon as the white hit hits, you will have enough rage to slam, if the white hit is a crit or a WF/sword proc, you'll have enough rage to do an instant the next cycle as well, otherwise you have one instant-less cycle.  I've found it's worth the risk and more often than not you'll get either a crit or a WF proc or a sword proc and it pays off.<br>

</div>Personally, I HS when the next white hit will potentially take me over 100 rage (which means wasted rage), so around 80-85 at most.  If you wait for the next white hit, without HS and then start slam spamming you just loose far too much rage generation from not that much of a DPS boost.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">It seems like I'm pulled into combat by our MT, so that kills my charge.  I don't have the rage to use Intercept, so i resort to hacking on the target with White attacks.  Meanwhile, the Hunters and Rogues are going crazy on the DPS. I glance at Damage Meter and I have just a little more DPS than the tank does.<br>
<br>
Crap.<br>

I can always hit Bloodrage, which gives me an extra 10, which is enough to get my white hit started, but that seems like it.</div>

</div>I use bloodrage then intercept. However, most of the time, I just walk up to the boss and press "1" (auto attack). Maybe because I'm 17/44, I get enough rage to start a BT very quickly. I've tried 33/28 and I'm always rage starved, but most likely it's because I don't have a good 2H weapon to do enough damage to get rage.</div>

</div>The only problem I have with this is that they changed intervene a while ago so that if you have an enemy targeted when you press intervene, you will intervene the enemies target. Yup, I've definitely intervened the MT on Prince during an enfeeble and the tanks on Bog lords when trying to run out before. Luckily I haven't really found any place to attempt this short bus maneuver in MH/BT.</div>

Expertise is not only for one type of Weapon. It doesn´t matter whether i take a mace or a sword if i have ~20 Expertiserating on an other item. So why should there be any difference between expertise granted by Racial or by Itemstats. <br>
<br>
If the Racial only adds Expertise on a hand in which an axe is, this would mean, that the Expertisecalculations for both hands are seperated, but i can´t believe this.<br>

But if my thoughts are totally wrong, please tell me, and if possible with some clear tests or evidence.<br>

Seems 5/5 Imp Demo is pointless in PvE if you're not running with CoR then. Weird that a talent quits being useful after 2 points spent (unless you combine it with another class ability). That can't really be working as intended. It has some use in pvp of course.</div>

Your damage breakdown seems to differ significantly from my own and I normally use a white-&gt;slam-&gt; instant cycle. What I find really interesting though is your use of Heroic Strike. I have always believed it was too rage inefficient to be used as many times as you do. Are you rage capped for most of the fight because I noticed you have a very high percentages. <br>

</div>I'm not sure if that Drow wws is fake or not, but sure is impressive. Personally I wouldn't rule out getting 5-6k numbers, maybe it's possible in an optimal scenario. I can share you my own numbers, which also fall between the 4/4,5k range, but without a feral druid in raid, or survival hunter, so it's possible to do better. One thing that also helped me was hacking the swing timer as detailed on the 2h weapon thread. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302201532/http://wowwebstats.com/os2pxgsd2jzxs?s=0-199&amp;a=1" target="_blank">Here</a>.</div>

<br>
yesterday in BT with a 33/28 spec i got 2 5500-5560 MSs in a row with all my buffs up. also a 5300 and a 5400 before the big 2 (all the same fight within 30 seconds, reck was up so it was 4 crit ms in a row), orc racial, expose weakness and boss at 0 armor. <br>
<br>
cruorr, i still dont understand you gaining 1400 dmg on your top ms crit from a 9% dmg buff and expose weakness/armor tho, there HAS to be something else. i belive rogue expose is like 400? pen over sunders? doesnt seem like thats quite enough, did you upgrade gear also? REALLY bad luck the previous 2 weeks?</div>

Short version: using my current gear(420 passive Armor Pen) my spreadsheet gives the following<br>

MH Uptime: ~41.4%<br>
OH Uptime: ~27.7%<br>
DW Uptime: ~57.6%<br>

So it comes down to if you would rather have that OH mongoose or an extra ~16% executioner uptime. DPS spreadsheets show that is about the same dps, so I would call personal preference. I like DW executioner because I plan on getting more Armor Pen and like smoother rage generation.</div>

</div>I'm unsure of what to make of the assertion that 1350 passive armor pen is the most you want unless you're trying to imply that Executioner double-stacks (it doesn't).<br>
<br>
On a typical raid boss of 6200 armor (Rage Winterchill, for example), with 520*5 armor reduced via sunders, 610 via faerie fire, and 800 via curse of recklessness (should you be so lucky), the remaining armor is 2190 and thus you are correct that more than (2190 - 840 = 1350) is the most passive armor pen you want to maximize the use of executioner...</div>

Low armor boss is 6200<br>
5x Sunder = 2600<br>
Faerie Fire = 610<br>
Curse of Recklessness = 800<br>
Executioner = 840<br>
<br>
So the boss would have 1350 armor left before your gear. Now all those may not be always up, and there are bosses with more armor so the max is higher but 1350 is pretty high for passive armor pen as it is.</div>

This clears up that it's a horribly edited/bugged log, thanks <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302201532im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":)" class="inlineimg"></div>

It is not bugged or edited. We got darkmoon buff + a survial hunter which we never had before. So I had 9% increased damage from darkmoon + survival hunter. We also had a feral druid tank and improved expose, which is 475 more armor reduction. We just wanted to have some fun and do some insane dps. <br>
<br>
So 9% increased damage + 475 armor + 300 atp... Also, maybe i got the 5900 with the str pot.. so thats an extra 132 str (kings) aswell. All that can def push an ms from 4600 - 5900. <br>
<br>
I hope to do a "normal" Teron next week finnaly with a survial hunter, and see what I do for dps. I had 2156 and 2130 (I think that the highest for a non darkmoon 33/28 warrior?) with 300 atp from expose weakness I hope for that to go up a lot.<br>
<br>
As for my rotation, I do not have one, sorry. I do whatever on the spot. I HS when I have a lot of rage. I do not constantly slam because sometimes I feel its just good to let the swings go rather then slow em down by .6/.7 seconds with slam. I think I have found a good balance. I cant really give an explanation I just "feel" when to slam/ms/WW/HS and when not to.</div>

</div>That's pretty much what I end up doing, but not really consciously.  I tried to keep a good slam rotation going when I tried raiding 33/28, but when DST, Flurry, Sword Spec, Windfury start doing back to back procs it just screws it up altogether.  I ended up trying out Serida's no slamming at all method tonight through an SSC vial run and ended up doing pretty much the same as I did when using slams, but it was a lot less "work" to do.  I'm sure on some fights I could have eeked out more DPS, but until they make slam "instant", there is always going to be the server/human delay factor that throws down DPS a little.</div>

</div>This might be a stupid question, but I'm curious because I've been toying with the idea of going 33/28.<br>
<br>
Are you seeing these kinds of results (not slamming, or slamming when it "feels right" to slam instead of after every single swing), because you've hit some sort of gear threshold that causes a two-handed build to start performing exceptionally well? Or was I just Doing It Wrong(tm) when I tried an MS build? <br>
<br>
<br>
My experiences with MS have generally had my sustained dps significantly lower than what I can do as Fury. I've read a lot in this thread that advises raids to favor 33/28 Blood Frenzy warriors as the first or only dps warrior in a raid, and I'm currently the only dps warrior in my raid. I also see WWS being posted with really high dps from two-handed warriors, and people saying that MS can do almost as much damage as Fury. Is this related to scaling, and only true in T6 content? <br>
<br>
If I could switch to 33/28 sword and do "almost as much" damage as what I do now, my raid's dps would go up, we run pretty physical heavy. For some reason we have a lot of pretty good hunters. I wouldn't top the meter anymore but if if it helped the raid as a whole kill bosses faster/kill bosses we're currently struggling with, I'd be happy anyway. <br>
<br>
So, I guess I'm asking, what's a realistic goal of personal dps for a 33/28 warrior using a sword (probably the Lionheart Champ or Executioner as it's the best, or one of the best, weapons readily available to me. S3 is out of the question, my arena teams aren't even close to 1850), in early T5 content? Assume here that I'm new to the slam rotation and that I'm a reasonably competent player and raider.</div>

</div>This is my first time posting on these forums so don't be too harsh on me if my assumptions on reading WWS stats are wrong.<br>
<br>
My gear consists of SSC/TK gear,some badge rewards and I dual wield the S1 honor Sword with Fool's Bane in my off hand.  As a human, my character screen states 10 expertise.    With weapon mastery, that should result in a -4.5% chance for opponents to dodge my attacks.  I'm hit capped for specials (approx 130 hit rating with 3/3 precision) so the only chance for me to 'miss' a mob should be about 5.8% from the dodges. <br>
<br>
So here's my damage breakdown from my guild's SSC run from a few days ago.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302201532/http://wowwebstats.com/b11ykoan32qrc?a=18" target="_blank">Jojoba - WWS</a><br>
All my misses came from dodges and parries (Which could probably have been avoided by slightly better positioning) and topped out at about 2%, 1% of which were dodges which seems to be as expected with 10 expertise..  Even though this is quite a small sample of hits, I'm sure it's indicative that the expertise racial bonuses from sword/mace combos on human warriors are stacking.  <br>
<br>
There is one other dual wielding fury warrior in my guild with about 200 hit rating and 0 precision and it's quite easy to see the difference in terms of misses on specials even on individual bosses (wws is harsh on him since he off tanked more encounters) and the comparable hit rate on white melee attacks. <br>
<br>
I'm considering maxing out my expertise by getting the brooch of deftness (currently using Worgen Claw Necklace from KZ) as i can clearly see the benefits to my white hits as well as specials.<br>
<br>
ps.  any comments as to my damage breakdown as I'm still trying to learn how to maximise my DPS after changing roles from tanking would be appreciated.</div>

		<div id="post_message_599558">Okay I have a question for all you experts out there. I am currently using the Wicked Edge of the Planes (2.7spd,97.6 dps) in my main and Fury (2.6spd,95.6dps) in my Offhand. While doing ZA again, the Rage (2.6spd,95.6dps) dropped. I was wondering if equal spd weapons still proc'd an extra Flurry attack and if so, would it make sense to switch my main hand to the Rage to gain the extra Flurry attack at the cost of only 2dps on the main hand until I find a weapon with 2.7 spd and eaual if not better dps then Wicked Edge?<br>
<br>
I also find that in events where I am on add duty (ex. Vashj a enhance shammy and I take care of Nagas) I like a fast offhand. I was using the Prowlers Blade last week when we finally down'd Vashj and no one wanted the Fang of Vashj (1.8spd,100.3dps) so I took it. Anyone else finding the fast offhand better in situations where they are changing targets a lot? Mainly because its tough to keep a good BT/WW rotation going when you have to run around a lot.</div>

		<div id="post_message_599574">I'm pretty sure that the 10 expertise from using sword+mace as a human is not intended and will probably be fixed. That said 5 expertise is worth about 10 dps in my gear and using a spreadsheet (going from 1153 total dps to 1163). Whether this is more than what you get from using a slow weapon as offhand of course depends on which weapons you're comparing. If I compare using the S2 slow vs fast sword in OH I get a dps difference of about 12 in the same gear (but for the OH). The true dps gain from using a slow OH is probably somewhat less however, the spreadsheet does not model the effect of miss streaks on your rage generation -&gt; cycle maintenance. Anyway, to me it seems that 5 expertise is worth about the same as slow-fast OH.<br>
<br>
Havocdemon, the effect of using matched speed on flurry uptime has not been proven (at least not in the Flurry mechanics thread on these boards), if anyone has a link to some proper made tests on this I would be very interested. But as long as I haven't seen any hard evidence for this I don't believe this effect is real. <br>
<br>
If it is a real effect I think the effect would be to add another proccing attack to the flurry uptime calculations (which would give something like 7-10% more flurry uptime for DW). This gives a dps increase on the order of 1% (in my gear, about 12 dps) using a spreadsheet. If I look at the spreadsheet results for Wicked edge vs Rage I get about 10 more total dps from Wicked edge.</div>

This implies with 1 point in improved whirlwind you can keep a perfect rotation of GCDs and keeping BT/WW on cooldown.  However, in real world situations, I've found that having a perfect rotation as fury is kind of pointless, and I personally use a priority system of BS&gt;BT&gt;WW&gt;RAMPAGE&gt;HS in theory.<br>
<br>
You can't really ask which items are worth expertise rating without first considering your current gear.  If you are in T4/T5 I'm sure there are other items with expertise worth wearing, but at end game, yes <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304035430/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=30106"><span  ><span class="purplename">[Belt of One-Hundred Deaths]</span></span></a> is the only "best in slot" item.</div>

</div>Thank you, i just use that prioroty system as well, so i never figured the gain from using a rotation on 2 fixed CD abilities.<br>

</div>Use Heroic Strike more. Considering you have 10% hit from gear your rage generation will be streaky if your OH keeps missing once in a while so try to HS to stay below 100 but at the same don't rage starve you so you can use BT and WW on cooldown.<br>

</div>Right, I saw that post (I even linked to it in an earlier post) just wasn't sure if that was enough because the parse contained lots of trash with various dodge rates. But if this is good enough for some real TCers then that's great, saves me some time. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304035430im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":)" class="inlineimg"></div>

		<div id="post_message_607483">Well, as mentioned in my post earlier, the trash is at least &gt;lvl 70. Thus they should all have base dodge chances above 5%. The logs from madrussian showed that the dodge was 0.7 (for both bosses and trash combined) with expertise stacking for mace/sword racials. With all dodge modifiers accounted for this gives a base dodge of 5.2-5.6 (for the statistics see the earlier post). To me, that's enough evidence to show that they do indeed stack currently. Blizzard has still not stated if this is intended or not (I think the racial is too strong as 10 expertise but that's just an opinion of course). <br>
<br>
This argument does of course assume that the base dodge is 5.0,5.2,5.4 and 5.6 for lvl 70, 71, 72 and 73 respectively.<br>
<br>
edit: it would actually be quite interesting if anyone could try to get some dodge statistics for boss fights with capped expertise, i.e. 2% from weapon mastery and 3.6 from racial and gear (i.e. try with both 14 and 15 expertise skill). If we can get enough swings with that kind of setup we would definitely know that the dodge chance is between 5.5 and 5.75. The lower the observed dodge chance is and the more total swings, the better statistics we can get.</div>

With my current gear in Fury I have 1851 AP, 163 Hit, and 28.87% crit and 420 Armor Pen vs my Arms gear which would be about 1816 AP, hit cap, 33.57% crit and also 420 Armor Pen. <br>

</div>MaxDps is  a fine place to see gear and get a basic estimations BUT is far from being accurate in total DPS result.<br>
Also take in mind the gear value is a personal issue 10 crit can be worth more when you are with better gear then 10 str. a thing that is not take into account in maxdps. Also when you hit 200+ hit , hit value goes down alot so +hit should not be a main issue for you.<br>
<br>
In total MaxDps is a fine site for basic knowledge use other means to caculate your DPS.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">MaxDps is  a fine place to see gear and get a basic estimations BUT is far from being accurate in total DPS result.<br>
Also take in mind the gear value is a personal issue 10 crit can be worth more when you are with better gear then 10 str. a thing that is not take into account in maxdps. Also when you hit 200+ hit , hit value goes down alot so +hit should not be a main issue for you.<br>
<br>
In total MaxDps is a fine site for basic knowledge use other means to caculate your DPS.</div>

	</table>
</div>I took a look at maxdps a few months ago and I must say, that I wouldn't trust it at all (unless they've made some major improvements). The number one problem was that they didn't have any calculations of rage generation (thus no Heroic strikes at all in total dps). This makes the dps for DW fury completely off. If the site does not take all factors into account I doubt it has accurate valuing of gear either.<br>
<br>
About the 200+ hit. Quit spreading around that silly number that has nothing to do with how things works in reality. The only two numbers you need to worry about for hit is 9% (cap for specials, most people would agree that this is the hit cap that is most important) and 28% (hard cap to hit). The value of hit goes down after reaching 9% (95 hit rating with Precision).</div>

For what it's worth, when I was fury I went for the socket bonus since str and crit were roughly the same (the spreadsheet will also tell you what stats are worth) so I went with an 8 str gem, a 4 str/crit gem and a 5 str/6 sta gem effectively "won" 1 str and 6 sta by going with the socket bonus (not to mention I needed that blue gem for my RED).<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I apologize if this has been asked already, I honestly put forth effort to look for information before posting. In any case, here goes. Maxdps lists the blessings deck as one of the top Fury trinkets in the game. Does this hold true? I mean it is essentially a constant 120AP buff, but is it really better than Bloodlust, TT, etc? It also has Dragonspine listed very low. Any help would be appreciated <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304054355im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":)" class="inlineimg"></div>

</div>Bloodlust Brooch offers 118AP if you use the cooldown whenever it's up so it's pretty close to Darkmoon without the drawback of having a charge up time which should be quite an advantage on mobility fights. Moreover, you can click the On Use at critical times for maximum effect like Blood Lust + Recklessness + Haste Potion + Execute part and similar (back when Deathwish was in Fury, using it together with the Brooch also worked nicely). Coincidentally, the Brooch has a 2 min CD just like Haste Potions so macroing those together works quite well, too.</div>

</div>If you want an accurate answer, you should get the Warrior DPS Spreadsheet (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304054355/http://elitistjerks.com/591550-post434.html" target="_blank">http://elitistjerks.com/591550-post434.html</a>), input your stats in the gear tab and click on the button called SEP. These will tell you what stat is going to boost your DPS by the most.<br>
<br>
Sure, I could have just made up some arbitrary numbers to tell you when ArP gets better and better, but that would be lying (and yeah, I do get the irony that this is coming from me &lt;_&lt;).</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Bob, what's your priority system for dpsing as prot? When I'm prot, I never use whirldwind but just spamming devastate, and using heroic strikes to burn excess rage. Looking at your WWS, I'm guessing you use whirlwind on every cooldown? Does it do more damage then just spamming devastate?<br>
<br>
I'm not familiar with prot dps, since as fury, whirlwind does a lot less damage than bloodthirst. And I only use whirlwind when bloodthirst is on cooldown. Which of course devastate doesn't have.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</div>My attack priority changes as the fight goes on.  Early on I only use devastate to help the tank stack sunders and let my rage build up a bit.  Once he has a good lead on me I'll use whirlwind on every cool down and heroic strike any time i'm above 25ish rage.  The real trick as a prot warrior is watching your threat since 2/3 of your damage comes from devastate and heroic strike which are rather unforgiving on the threat.  Your attacks are very efficient, however, and with a bloodlust going, I've sustained over 1600 dps for the duration of the bloodlust (at which point I generally pull agro and die if I don't have salvation on)<br>
<br>
When choosing prot dps gear, you only really need 9% +hit since most of your damage is special attacks (not that additional +hit is bad).  The rest I just go for whatever has the overall highest number of stats or whatever leftovers the dps guys don't want (most fights I am tanking so I'm rather low priority on the dps gear)  I count stamina as a useful dps stat when choosing my dps gear because much of the time I will end up having to throw on a shield and help tank anyway (I'm the main tank so I only get to dps when we are training up one of the newer tanks or trying to convince one of the "dps classes" to spec into something useful for raiding)<br>
<br>
As a general rule, if the prot warrior is doing more damage than you are, you are doing something wrong.</div>

<br>
Unlike popular belief, using a Sword in the arena is still viable. As it stands, Mace and Sword are equal in my eyes. Possibly game breaking stuns versus possible game breaking burst. Personally, I plan to get the sword on my warrior. Being a Gladiator on my warrior, and on a top ranked 3v3 team on the battlegroup since the first week of season three, sword apparently does work.... or my battlegroup is aweful. Not needing a different weapon for PvE is nice, too <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304054355im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":)" class="inlineimg"><br>
<br>
I noticed a few people mentioning PvE hybrid builds, and they are certainly still viable. You may not get into a top 20 team without TM anymore, but a flurry build is certainly still good. 33/28 PvE MS is a fantastic build for a lot of setups(double healer warrior comes to mind for 3s, or double warrior triple healer 5s). Also, the Arena gear is a solid substitute for 2h PvE dps... better than tier5 in most cases.</div>

</div>Stacking sunders helps get the tank their 5 sunders faster making their own devastates more effective.  Early on in a fight, a prot warrior is going to be a bit short on the rage and their highest threat attacks will be a simultaneous shield slam and heroic strike (upon initial contact with the boss) followed by revenge (if it's up), and then devastate.  Devastate doesn't reach it's potential till all 5 sunders are up due to decreased damage.<br>
<br>
Also consider that if I'm in bzrk stance with salvation on, I will be generating 56% less threat (see early in the article) and due to defiance, the tank will be generating 15% more agro per devastate.<br>
<br>
Finally consider that my devastates (up to 5 stacked total) do more than just add to my own threat, but add to the tank's threat as well because he will be doing an extra 35 damage for each of mine i stack (up to a total of 5 on the target).  This means that he doesn't need to waste his rage on low threat devastates but can rather spend the saved rage on higher threat initial attacks and then higher threat devastates once the 5 are stacked.<br>
<br>
Saying that an off tank stacking devastate reduces the main tank's threat is like saying thunderclap or demo shout reduces the main tank's threat.  If that were the case, no one would ever use a debuff bitch to maintain debuffs the main tank is too busy to do himself.<br>
<br>
I understand that as a prot warrior, I have to be especially careful when forced into a damage dealing alternative role due to the high threat nature of my damaging attacks.  But it is also my job as a prot warrior (when not tanking) to keep high on the threat so I can take over if the main tank gets into trouble (sacrificing myself if necessary to buy the healers time to get that all critical heal off).  And if the main tank goes down at the end of the fight, it would be my job to throw on the shield (regardless of wearing dps gear), pop last stand and shield wall, and give the raid that extra few seconds to get down that last percent or two.<br>
<br>
Granted I'm usually the one tanking and not doing damage.  I'm just making the argument for those rare times the prot warrior needs to show that he's more than just a damage speed bump between the boss and the raid.</div>

		<div id="post_message_611832">I think what he was alluding to was the apparent fact that the initial 5 devastates not only put out their inherent threat and threat from damage, but the threat a normal sunder armor would as well(this was added with the addition of the sunder armor effect to devastate in 2.2 or 2.3). This is referenced somewhere in the last few pages of The Protection Warrior thread. <br>
<br>
I'm at a loss to understand why a warrior (low on rage mind you) would HS off the bat, when the threat from the abilities you get for not wasting HS rage will get you more "snap aggro" anyhow.<br>
<br>
Your first priority as dpsing prot warrior should be debuffing the boss with demo and TC anyways, and doing so helps MT threat substantially as well.<br>

		<div id="post_message_611861">The reason I generally lead off with a heroic strike is because if I queue it up before I approach the boss, it will trigger the moment I get within striking range (sometimes shield slam or sunder / devastate can lag a bit and give an out of range result while still on approach to the boss).  The heroic strike will generate sufficient agro at the start of the fight to prevent any reasonable healing from pulling the boss off me and an immediate shield slam (or any other global cool down ability you wish to use) gives you two practically simultaneous attacks.  The basic theory is that if you miss right off the bat, the boss can run free and cause trouble.  Adding a running throw from the decapitator gives you a third attack with nominal threat to insure a stable beginning of the boss fight.<br>
<br>
I'm NOT suggesting prot warriors choose to use heroic strike in preference to shield slam but rather queue it up along with a global cool down attack to get two simultaneous attacks at initial contact with the boss.  The entire purpose is to minimize the risk of a miss / mitigated attack as well as give some insurance against initial contact lag.<br>
<br>
My discussion on prot warrior dps is more academic since most of the time a prot warrior will be tanking but the ability to do damage is still important so you can hold your own when you have to.</div>

My guild is now progressing to the point where Vashj and Kael weapons will be accessable.

Rod of the Sun King could be an excellent weapon based on the extra amount of rage it could provide, while Fang of Vashj sports what I have read to be the best offensive stat (expertise).  Searching the forum shows rod of the sun king isnt a terribly great weapon, but I'm wondering if there is someone who uses/used it that can give me their opinion.<br>

</div>I have to disagree here as well. Using Devastate early on will cut on your MTs threat because of the added aggro of Sunder on the first 5 applications.<br>
That being said, I usually don't care much about that myself since helping to apply Sunders boosts my own DPS and that of the raid anyway, you just have to be careful at the first few seconds in the fight which is why I suggest you always start off with a WW, then Dev and burn rage via HS. WW, unlike Dev, doesn't have added threat on it.<br>

</div>This seems fairly counterintuitive. I think that the new devastate should either count as using both skills at the same time all the time, incorporating all effects, threat and damage of both, or simply work as devastate always did, with the added effect of applying the sunder armor script effect. If what you say is true, we're now getting the the former mechanic on the first five applications and the latter mechanic after that, which is behaviour sunder armor doesn't even have on its own, so I don't see how it makes sense for the new devastate. I guess this is either sloppy coding, or I'm missing something obvious here.<br>
<br>
Now, I realize the way you say it works actually benefits us at exactly the time when threat gen is usually most critical and especially since the only alternative and most logical way the new dev should work is simply by never giving any sunder armor-based threat at all (since applying it all the time would likely be overpowered), I don't want to really complain about it. Just thought this works in a rather strange way if what you say is true.</div>

88 ap passive (+44 over dragonspine)<br>
20 hit passive (+20 over dragonspine)<br>
120 armor penetration (300 * 40% appx uptime)<br>
<br>
Now the extra hit, ap and armor penetration are nice, however, look at the total amount of "budget" on each item with these approximations:<br>
<br>
Assuming 1 stat budget point = 2 ap = 1 haste rating = 1 hit rating = 7 armor penetration<br>
<br>
Appx budget for DST: 20+81= <b>101</b><br>
Appx budget for MOTB: 44+20+17= <b>81</b><br>
<br>
Although hit is the best stat for rogues to stack up to cap, other stats are close to as good overall, and in terms of total stats MOTB is behind significantly (~20%) compared to DST. I think blizzard needs to make the 300 armor penetration passive rather than a proc, then MOTB would basically be tied with DST instead of inferior in terms of budget. Either that or nerf DST again.</div>

<br>
(90ap + 360ap * (20sec/120sec)) * (1 budget / 2 ap) = <b>75</b> (possibly less if you save it to be used with other cooldowns such as bloodlust)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
My question is: How can you conclude that any trinket (besides solarian's) is better than DST? I'm going to have to see the math on this one.</div>

<br>
I napkin math'd out the stat budget in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080209122146/http://elitistjerks.com/f15/t10333-dragonspine_trophy_analysis/p19/" target="_blank">this thread</a> dedicated to the DST:<br>

To add <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080209122146/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=33831"><span  ><span class="purplename">[Berserker's Call]</span></span></a>:<br>
<br>
(90ap + 360ap * (20sec/120sec)) * (1 budget / 2 ap) = <b>75</b> (possibly less if you save it to be used with other cooldowns such as bloodlust)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
My question is: How can you conclude that any trinket (besides solarian's) is better than DST? I'm going to have to see the math on this one.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</div>I personally wouldn't rate 1 haste rating close to 2 ap.  Depending on your bloodlust usage, (we typically bloodlust at 98% or so) Berzerker's Call has near maximum cooldown usage, and you can stack it with recklessness/haste potion/drums/bloodlust, as well as stacking it with a haste potion every time you use it.<br>
<br>
Then again, what would I know, my guild has only seen 2 DST, 2 Tsunami Talisman, 2 MotB, and I've been outrolled on every Berzerker's Call, so all I have are spreadsheets/personal stat preferences to back it up.  <br>

2.2k dps on Teron with a Bloodlust Brooch and an Hourglass of the Unraveler, yay for RNG.</div>

</div>Out of curiosity then you don't use bloodlust for execute range? It depends on the fight, but most of the time I see it being more effective, and the timing really doesnt matter for anyone else but warriors. Even without that I am having a hard time seeing Berserker's, Tsunami, or (depending on gear) even MotB better than DST. With a 20 sec cooldown its somewhere around 20-25% uptime, though I want to double check my logs to verify that.<br>

I'm surprised at the relatively low number of devastates you did...35 Heroic Strikes and only 37 Devastates and 15 Whirlwinds?  Assuming with a 2.8 MH weapon, i would have assumed roughly twice as many instants as Heroic Strike (if you used every attack), and about 5 times as many devastates as whirlwinds...for something like 35 HS 60 Devastates 15 whirlwinds.<br>
<br>
So you had 75 Melee attacks and 35 Heroic Strikes, with 16 "gained one attack through windfury"...So that's around 35+(75-16)*1.5/2.8 ~ 66 Main Hand attacks and only 52 instant attacks?  <br>
<br>
Like I said, i would have expected on the order of 75 or so instants (once you guess at haste effects like Heroism, drums, etc).<br>
<br>
<br>
Edit:  No improved Shield Block (I assume you're uncrushable?) or Shield Mastery? I find that curious.</div>

</div>I use Furious Shackles instead of Bracers of Eradication too...but it's because I haven't killed Lurker when I was a DPS warrior (vs. a tank)... possibly ever.  Some items are just so poorly designed that it makes me cry just a little inside.   Like the Belt of Seething Fury?  It's like 30 ilevels above Red Belt of Battle...but far far far far worse.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I'm surprised at the relatively low number of devastates you did...35 Heroic Strikes and only 37 Devastates and 15 Whirlwinds?  Assuming with a 2.8 MH weapon, i would have assumed roughly twice as many instants as Heroic Strike (if you used every attack), and about 5 times as many devastates as whirlwinds...for something like 35 HS 60 Devastates 15 whirlwinds.<br>
<br>
So you had 75 Melee attacks and 35 Heroic Strikes, with 16 "gained one attack through windfury"...So that's around 35+(75-16)*1.5/2.8 ~ 66 Main Hand attacks and only 52 instant attacks?  <br>
<br>
Like I said, i would have expected on the order of 75 or so instants (once you guess at haste effects like Heroism, drums, etc).<br>

</div>Nod, looking back at the numbers it could definitely be optimized. It should probably be a 6-devastate 1-whirlwind rotation.

(As Fury) I've heard talk about NOT executing at 19%, and just continuing your regular DPS rotation, maybe dumping extra rage in between BT/WW with an execute.<br>

Is this viable? And, at what gear level would this actually be worth considering?<br>

Irregardless, as I understand it, execute generally loses it's spunk around T6 gear levels, moreso if you let it consume more than 25ish rage. It's a gradual thing, so it doesn't suddenly become horrible and you will have to look at your own avarage hits for the various abilities you use to figure out when the change actually occurs. Although I'm pretty sure you'll be able to find more exact figures on this if you use that search function.</div>

Indeed, a search on the thread for Execute would have yielded some replies of value.<br>

In summary though, the main thing is Execute does not scale very much; 2pc T6 + Imp Execute being the sole optimisation at high gear levels. I believe the math worked out to be if you have above ~2900AP then BT when it's up as it's more efficient, Execute on the other cooldowns.</div>

</div>Wrong. Armor penetration provides a scaling value. Yes, it applies to everything, not just Execute. Also, 2.9k AP is a very high guess. A 10rage Execute &lt; 30rage BT when AP is around 2100 or so. As far as a 30rage Execute vs BT I cannot offer insight, but that 2.9k value sounds roughly correct.</div>

		<div id="post_message_624252">Point taken about Armor Penetration, but that applies to all things equally (decrease in % dmg mitigated) so it's not "wrong" since the effect is the same on BT or Execute.  The benefit of ArP does not split the result so offers no answer.<br>
<br>
As to the rest, took me 20 secs just now to run the search where I got the numbers, you could try it too.  If you disagree with those numbers, post up some alternative analysis to disprove it.  It notes 30 rage execute vs BT, but really that is assumed to be the rage opportunity since BT is even an option.<br>

		<div id="post_message_626332">Does anyone know how much of an effect latency has on warrior DPS?<br>
<br>
I noticed that my DPS took a dive when I changed to a slower internet (went from ~80ms to ~200ms on average w/ the TCP registry modification).<br>
<br>
The thing is, I usually manage to get off my BT and WW whenever the CD comes down. It just seems like my DPS is being lost somewhere due to the latency, but I'm not sure how my latency would do this. White attacks shouldn't be effected at all by my latency, although there could be a very slight DPS loss due to my instants coming in slightly slower. They seem to go register instantly, though.<br>
<br>
Also, I noticed there was roughly a 100DPS boost a while ago when I got a new computer since. It's generally the same idea - on the old comp I was hitting my BT and WW the instant they came up and they seemed to go through, yet my DPS saw a considerable boost when I switched to a comp with a better FPS.</div>

I attributed most of it to less time spent out of range, since quite a lot of dps time is spent moving around. With low fps you will be much slower in getting to a new position. Lag spikes and low fps will also cause you to miss BT/WW cooldowns but should not be a very big effect. I doubt you'd see a very big effect in a static fight.</div>

		<div id="post_message_626869">Hey guys.  This is just a check to make sure my calculations and values are correct. I'm currently standing at around -1050 before Executioner.  T6 bosses have a minimum of 6200 armor value. So:<br>
<br>
If normal boss debuffs are -2600 - 610 - 800 (5xsunder, faerie fire, CoR)<br>
6200 - 2600 - 610 - 800 = -4010<br>
<br>
From that I'll take my potential maximum penetration including Executioner proc: -1940<br>
-4010 - 1940 = -5950<br>
<br>
Is it safe to assume I can still stack an additional 250 armor penetration before I reach 0 armor value and start wasting the stat?<br>

		<div id="post_message_626871">Small update, I was going over my DPS, rotations, etc. Trying to find out what it was that might be gimping my DPS.<br>
<br>
For the most part my hit gear has gotten lower, and I've felt rage starved, in addition, using 2 2.6 speed weapons means when Flurry is down, I really, really feel rage starved, and my DPS just drops, it's not uncommon even raid buffed for me to sit there for 5-10 seconds at a time with no Flurry procs(The Flurry bug I bitched about that hasn't been fixed yet also doesn't help -_-)<br>
<br>
So this week in Black Temple I decided to throw Hamstring back into my skill rotation, I figured the additional crits from Hamstring would do more harm then good. I tested it out in Blasted Lands first. Using a BT/WW with Heroic Strike rotation at first, that resulted in around 1200-1250DPS on those Blasted Mobs. Then I switched over to a BT-&gt;WW-&gt;HamS-&gt;HamS rotation, and noticed my DPS was floating around 1300-1350 on average for that rotation. I did 1 million damage about 6 times for 6 different tests, and decided using Hamstring in a live environment wouldn't hurt.<br>
<br>
So this week in Black Temple I gave it a whirl, and my overall DPS was much much better. :X Was averaging 1700-1800 on most boss fights on AVERAGE, and a record high 2050 on Mr. Teron Gorefiend, not bad for a first go round of it. I still felt awkward at times, and actually wasted rage hitting Hamstring when BT was up -_-, but as I get more comfortable with it, I should see steady improvement as I polish it all out.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I've noticed feast and famine a lot as well. I've only recently (2wks ago) switched to a slow/slow setup and am still getting used to it. I've also noticed smoother rage generation while spamming HString. I'm getting better about making sure BT and WW are available (enough rage) whenever they are off cd, however I don't wait for rage if they are off cd, but insufficient rage to use them. I will hit HString (same reason- Flurry proc) while waiting for the slow white hits to bring in rage.<br>
BT &gt; WW &gt; HString ... but I use a GCD <i>always</i> (unless BT is 1/2 a second or so from cd and there is ample rage) rather than sit and wait.</div>
			
		</td>

	</table>
</div>I also took a while to switch from fast to slow. I used to use 2.7/1.4 and went to 2.7/2.6. I found without WF, buffs, drums and so on its very noticeable. For trash and 5 mans I have been using my execute weapons(1.5/1.4) and found it much easier. When the mob only lives for 6-15 seconds its important not to miss and not have rage. On a longer boss fight you can build a reserve and a miss wont hurt as much.<br>
<br>
I am trying to find some way to work streaks into spreadsheets but will probably have to settle for an approximation(which is what sheets are anyway). I suspect that the gap between fast and slow is smaller than people think. It all depends on your hit of course, but its hard to get over ~14% +hit without losing other stuff.</div>

</div>I run with 10,74% hit too. Sometimes you have problems, when miss-streaking, most times its absolutely no problem. With Melee Shaman, LOTP, full raid buffs, probably CoR/Faerie Fire on the boss and pots, you have always enough rage on boss fights. Though trashmobs can be annoying, with 2 slow weapons and low hitrating the rage-gain at the beginning of the fight is not very efficient.<br>
<br>
<br>
I have a little question about Cloak of Fiends:<br>
<br>
Atm I'm wearing Dory's Embrace, and I'm at 616 passive ArP. Spreadsheet is telling me Cloak of Fiends is 1,6 more DPS with CoR + Fearie Fire on the boss (14,56% haste with Cloak of Fiends) and 504 ArP. So should I wear Cloak of Fiends, or stay with Dory's Embrace (12 stamina and 20 Res more)?</div>

</div>I transitioned to slow/slow with the patch that made WW hit with both weapons.  It took about a week to get used to it, but for the most part the only thing is to not ever hit HS unless you are over 50 rage or so to ensure that you have enough rage to carry out your cycle in the event you get an unlucky miss streak or lack of crits.  I can definitely say that my DPS is better with slow/slow than it was with slow/fast.  Either that or I just got better at the game. It is just a matter of learning to budget rage.  Your rage generation over the course of a fight will be the same, it just comes in bigger bursts.  You can, in essence, get off the same amount of the same kinds of attacks, you just can't hit your rage dump like a rabid weasel every time there is enoughrage to hit it.  You have to adjust to waiting for your rage to be at a level that it needs to be dumped.  So that you don't have to waste your time armorying me for a frame of reference for my + hit to yours, I have 191 hit rating.</div>

</div>How much dps do you do as fury?<br>
How much dps do you do as arms? If you're 31 in arms and no BFrenzy (33 in arms), you are officially a complete waste of a raid slot. You are doing less dmg, more threat, and no raid buff compared to fury.<br>
<br>
As soon as your personal dps (as arms) + 4% of all physical dps &gt; your personal dps (as fury) + all other physical dps, then you make the switch. Typically, even if you are melee light, just having 4-5 other physical dps will prove BFrenzy being the more beneficial spec. (In other words, Blizz needs to make fury raid-worthy again.)</div>

</div>Just checked our latest Rage Winterchill kill:<br>
<br>
Total raid dps: 16018<br>
Psysical dps in raid: 9051  (3 hunters, 2 rogues, 1 fury, 1 prot in dps gear, 1 prot tank, 2 ferals)<br>
<br>
If Deep wounds have 100% uptime, that means the BF equals 362 dps. In my experience, Deep Wounds should have over 90% uptime.<br>
<br>
Just check your WWS logs for psys damage and calculate the effect of BF. If it's greater than the dps difference between your specs, you spec 33/28</div>

Is 8 str and 2.2% haste really an upgrade over 175 Arp?  Both gloves seem to be a wash unless you are using a 2h and are already at the Arp "cap".  And I don't understand why so many items have haste on them.  It was a moderately questionable stat prior to the nerf, and almost certainly not worth it after except maybe a supplemental piece here or there if again you are using a 2h.  So far, the only item I can see that is a "clear" upgrade would be the new bracers.  But then that's to be expected since the old came from a T5 dungeon.</div>

</div>Yeah, I really don't think that the plate gloves are that great compared to the <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080210181203/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=32278"><span  ><span class="purplename">[Grips of Silent Justice]</span></span></a>. The Leatherworking ones do seem better.<br>
<br>
I'm suprised that the plate chestpiece is pretty much being ignored though. It looks like the new best-in-slot plate chestpiece. Even if you desperately needed the hit on it, if you put 3 +10 hit gems in it, then compared it to the <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080210181203/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=32365"><span  ><span class="purplename">[Heartshatter Breastplate]</span></span></a><br>
<br>
You trade off:<br>
-2 Strength<br>
+10 Stamina<br>
-3 Crit Rating<br>
+280 Armor Pen<br>
<br>
Which seems like a decent upgrade. Same goes for <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080210181203/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=30975"><span  ><span class="purplename">[Onslaught Breastplate]</span></span></a>.<br>
+8 Strength<br>
+0.82% crit (~18 crit rating)<br>
+1 stam<br>
-16 hit<br>
+154 Armor Pen<br>
<br>
You're also way more likely to get the crafted BP's socket bonus of +4 crit rating since all the sockets are red.<br>
<br>
Speaking of haste, did anyone see the new tanking chest piece off of a vendor? <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080210181203/http://www.worldofraids.com/2008/ptr/24/plate.jpg" target="_blank">http://www.worldofraids.com/2008/ptr/24/plate.jpg</a> 2nd column, bottom item. What is up with 40 haste on that? I hope it's a typo.

		<div id="post_message_633209">I'm relatively new to these forums, and a brand new poster, but I was curious as to the itemization of Sunwell gear concerning 33/28 warriors.  I was glancing over the equipment on MMO-Champion and saw that a majority of it had haste rating, now when I think of haste rating the first thing that popped into my mind was the faster my weapon, the larger percentage of my weapon swing I'd be cutting off by using slam.  Basically, what I thought was the faster my swing the more worthless slam became.  <br>
<br>
Although that may in fact be the case, I also remember reading posts by warriors who use swords (I have a Cat's Edge as well) that wouldn't even use slam in their rotation, but instead would spamstring between MS and WW cooldowns. After comparing gear (My math may be a little off because it's quite early and I've been up all night) I found that I would gain 88 AP, .75 crit, 14.2% passive haste, along with a 45 hit rating LOSS (that does drop me under the cap, but with a Draeni and 20 hit food I'm still capped) as well as 467 ARP loss.<br>
<br>
Keeping in mind, the warriors who were using these rotations with hamstring were putting up similar numbers to those who use slam in WWS (I don't have them off hand, unfortunately) otherwise I would not have considered this a viable option in the first place.<br>
<br>
On the flip side, the other setup would yield roughly: 148 AP gain, 462 ARP, and 26 haste, with a loss of 19 hit rating and roughly .5% crit. Using ideally the same weapon (Apolyon, the Soul-render) I'd be sitting at a passive 1256 ARP with this setup. (This is using the leather gear as well). Considering a 6200 armor boss, this sits me 100 ARP~ below the "cap".<br>
 <br>
All of these stats are direct comparisons from the gear I'm wearing currently, and I have an Armory link to it, but it's slow as usual and it has me in my pvp gear at the moment, but incase it updates: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080214014023/http://www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Laughing+Skull&amp;n=Drazkyl" target="_blank">The World of Warcraft Armory</a><br>
<br>
My first thought would be to go for the haste gear, simply because I think it would make my life a lot easier (slamming can be really painful at times dependant on the fight, and heroism/drums + moving + slam = sadface).  But I'd like the input of some others who could perhaps give me their opinion on this, and I'm aware there are spreadsheets for questions like this as well, but I don't have access to Excel so I really can't use that option.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the feedback in advance, and feel free to nitpick and criticize as I may have over-looked something.</div>

</div>That would be true if you aren't having to give up large amounts of one stat to get it.  It's no different than giving up 3-5% hit and 5% crit to reach high levels of ArP.  In the end, regardless of what spreadsheets say, the DPS ends up being similar whichever route you decide to go.  At least according to people that have access to full sets of either option.  Haste is barely better than hit, which is the lowest DPS stat for a well geared Warrior.  If they had never nerfed haste, it would absolutely be a good stat now, especially with how high the ratings are on some of the pieces, but a lot of this gear seems custom made for 2h builds, and only as a marginal upgrade or sidegrade to BT gear.  The breastplate and bracer are great, everything else looks bland on paper.  Even the T6 belt looks like it has poorly distributed stats compared to the RBoB for an upgrade.  It basically allows you to trade in the same belt you already have for a *very marginal* upgrade that nets you 1/2 of the set bonus.  Couple that with the bracer and you do see a slight boost, but on it's own it's not all that spectacular.</div>

Its not bad, its just that the item budget for it could be used for much better things. Compared to say rogues, who hit more which gains more energy which does more specials, warrior specials are on cooldowns. Once you have the rage to keep BT/WW on cooldown, and anyone getting the new gear should, you dump it into HS. Haste just has no effect on ~40% of your damage, depending on gear. Strength and Crit affect everything.<br>
<br>
I am disappointed in the lack of ArP. A couple pieces have a lot, and the rest have haste. I thought ArP was going to be our big thing and rogues would go more for haste, but the gear is the opposite.</div>

Where haste does help out is in the item budget.  If an item already has good values of crit, str and armor penetration, adding more to any of those would give a smaller damage boost than using the same budget on haste rating.  It's just making it that much more complicated that you'll have to calculate your SEP every time you acquire a new item and plug it into something like ItemValue so you can compare item to item what's going to work for you.<br>
<br>
The other neat thing is that if you get your swing speed ever so slightly below 2.5, then you could mash buttons constantly and have a perfect rotation.</div>

</div>It's not a lot better than hit, it's marginally better. You don't want to miss with your off hand, and trading hit for haste doesn't really improve upon that, it just allows for quicker Heroics and WF procs at a slight cost in rage generation.  I can only speak for myself, but I can't Heroic every single swing while keeping both instants on cooldown as well as Rampage up except on a few specific boss encounters.<br>

		<div id="post_message_634173">There's always a huge debate going on if Fury or MS spec is better for DPS. I was wondering if anyone ever tried a def spec to do DPS. Being one of the MTs in our guild I am bound 99% of the time to a def spec. However, recently I had the opportunity to try out a 17/3/41 spec for better aggro build-up. When we got to Teron Gorefiend I was even able to drive some decent DPS with this spec. <br>
<br>
Spec:<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080214014023/http://www.wow-europe.com/de/info/basics/talents/warrior/talents.html?350003013020000000000000200000000000000000002055511032000103501251" target="_blank">World of Warcraft Europe -&gt; Game Guide -&gt; Charakter -&gt; Talente -&gt; Krieger</a><br>
<br>

<br>
Equip during Teron fight:<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080214014023/http://www.chardev.org/?template=22168" target="_blank">chardev.org - A World of Warcraft character planner v.2.beta</a><br>
<br>
I was very much focusing on STR on my equip because of the 10% talent spec. It's not the greatest equip but it is decent and with the numbers from WWS I was wondering if any warrior with some better equip would be interested to try out the spec a little more. For me the benefits of this spec were pretty clear from the beginning. With dual-wield you are able to gain good rage generation to be independent and not relient on a shaman with a WF totem. During that fight I only had a feral druid as a supporter. I made a macro for the following rotation: 6xDevestate, 1xWhirlwind. Most of the DPS comes actually from the WW while the Devestate provides steady DPS. While doing this rotation without a shaman it is possible to gradually gain rage which means HS can be used during the rotation to spike up the DPS. With a shaman it would be possible to add HS more often to increase DPS by quite a bit.<br>
The idea behind this spec/rotation is quite simple, while BT and MS have a 6 second cooldown Devestate only has a GC. It is possible to compensate the damage of BT/MS by using Devestate every GC. It is also extremly important not to burn to much rage through HS so to not to loose a GC for Devestate. The other thing is that most tanks use fast tanking weapons and most tanking weapons are actually fast weapons. Using a slow weapon with Devestate can increase the DPS substantially. Right now the S3 Main-Hand or the Supremus Mace would be the best weapon for such a spec.<br>
All in all I think this is a viable spec considering it is possible to tank decently with this setup and with some fine tweaking to do good DPS. I won't be able to try out the spec too often so it would be great if an Off-Tank had some time to maybe play around with it and give some feedback on it. <br>
<br>
<br>
The other thing that I wanted to ask is. Would it be viable to use Slam in a 17/44/0 spec while using the LD50 swing timer mod and 2 weapons with almost the same weapon speed doing essentially 2 white swings followed by a slam and so on? Pretty much a MS slam rotation with 2 weapons.</div>

<br>
This wasn't my typical spec and before a handful of upgrades.  I don't need how Flurry and other random haste procs can throw off a rotation to be explained, but it's not really as black and white as you make it out to be.</div>

</div>Well, essentially the setup that I posted up there (Approx. 14.2% haste) Is 224 haste rating.  So obviously that number is pretty easily attainble seeing as how there are no rings/amulet/cloak/ranged weapon in that build that even have haste.  So assuming You just tack on 14% to the 15 most 33/28 warriors have you're sitting at 29.2% Which brings a 3.5 to 2.478 on your swing speed. <br>
<br>
No one in the game has "perfect" ping and everyone is pretty much going to be chopping off more of their swing than they would want to be no matter how quick you are.  The way I consider haste towards a slam build is if you have a 3.5 swing speed and are taking .5 off of that per white attack to get your slam in, you're taking 14.28% of your swing off of every rotation that includes slamming, which in a perfect scenario you'll be slamming after every white attack.  <br>
<br>
Now you consider using a 2.5 speed weapon, which some believe is the ideal speed for just being able to have globals govern your rotation, which I can't argue with because it would be a lot easier to do it that way, but that .5 turns into 25% of your swing instead of 14%.. Basically you're losing 11% MORE of your white swings using a faster weapon and continuing to slam rotate in the same manner, my logic on this of course could very well be flawed, so if someone could disprove me it would help me figure out which way I'd like to go.<br>
<br>
Considering that those stats would be just sitting around, and don't include heroism, drums of battle (which our dps group uses constantly) and at that point slamming would just be utterly useless, so that's why I am considering going the way of spamstring and seeing the actual dps it can put out.</div>

</div>It doesn't no, however if you decrease your swingtimer to below 2.5 it'll normally result in one not being able to keep up the slam rotation due to, as I have understood (which may very well be wrong) it, human response time as well as the fact that if you're swinging at a 2.2 speed, you might as well just spam MS/WW and throw in some HS (or Cleave, what ever blows your skirt up).</div>

</div>The best way to come to a the conclusion is to take it to the extreme.  Say you have a 0.5 speed weapon and slam was not on the global cooldown.  You can swing constantly for X damage every .5 seconds, or every other swing you can cast slam instead for X+140, cutting out 50% of your white damage.  Obviously weaving slam does more damage than not weaving slam.<br>
<br>
Sub 2.5s, you could alter your rotation to be e.g. swing/slam, MS, swing, swing/slam, WW, swing, swing/slam.  This would require more of a "by-the-feel" reaction than to try to program it because you wouldn't want to keep MS or WW off of cooldown for very long, but would be more DPS than cutting out slam entirely.  Weaving slams would no longer be your priority however; keeping MS and WW on cooldown would be, and you'd weave a slam in whenever feasible.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">That would be true if you aren't having to give up large amounts of one stat to get it.  It's no different than giving up 3-5% hit and 5% crit to reach high levels of ArP.  In the end, regardless of what spreadsheets say, the DPS ends up being similar whichever route you decide to go.  At least according to people that have access to full sets of either option.  Haste is barely better than hit, which is the lowest DPS stat for a well geared Warrior.  If they had never nerfed haste, it would absolutely be a good stat now, especially with how high the ratings are on some of the pieces, but a lot of this gear seems custom made for 2h builds, and only as a marginal upgrade or sidegrade to BT gear.  The breastplate and bracer are great, everything else looks bland on paper.  Even the T6 belt looks like it has poorly distributed stats compared to the RBoB for an upgrade.  It basically allows you to trade in the same belt you already have for a *very marginal* upgrade that nets you 1/2 of the set bonus.  Couple that with the bracer and you do see a slight boost, but on it's own it's not all that spectacular.</div>

	</table>
</div>Well lets try to use some math in the whole process. The thing to remember is, our raid caters to melee a lot. I usually run with a feral/enh shaman + we have a surv hunter, boomkin druid, ret paladin. Any raid buff to melee you can name, we do have it. Obviously it affects my SEP as it boosts all my other stats, but i doubt it will be THAT much off for other warriors.<br>
<br>
a) "Haste affects 60% of your damage". Im not sure, for me white + heroic is over 70% right now. Id like to see the hard data for other warriors, but on low armor bosses in MH/BT its like 40% of my damage is heroic strikes, with white being 2nd then BT at below 15% etc. Lets compare it thought. 16 haste rating gives 1% boost to 70% of my damage.<br>
So 0.7% dmg increase/16 rating = 0.043% increase per rating<br>
Than:<br>
<br>
*   1% crit (22 rating), increases my white  damage by around 0.6%(since i already have around 50% crit in raids and 25% is glancings, and increases yellow damage by 0.75% (50% crit/impale). So 0.6%x0.3+0.75%*0.7 =0.705% dmg increase. 0.705%/22 = 0,032% increase per rating. Crit is valued at 0.75% of haste for me.<br>
<br>
I just made this one comparison to show possible reasons why haste goes that high up - because you have NO haste atm. Its just a situation where crit/hit/ap are sort of on "diminishing returns" because they are so high. While haste is a brand new stat to stack on.   <br>
<br>
According to dps spreadsheets if crit = 100SEP then<br>
<br>
STR =94<br>
AGI = 75<br>
HASTE = 140 !!<br>
-7 AC = 140 !!<br>
HIT = 58<br>
EXPERTISE = 112<br>
<br>
Now the trick is - im already at 1330 ArP with my dual wield. While i will drop SOME going to sunwell loot, its still awfully close to cap. So while its a good stat too and ill be seeking it, one needs to remain very careful. <br>
<br>
Expertise on other hand is good, but you need to take one thing into account (and why its lower then haste). While equal amount of expertise rating will reduce dodge by 1% and increase haste by 1% - it still puts haste ahead. Most people will say "But haste doesnt affect 100% of my dmg, expertise does". True but consider: (assume you have ONE % chance to be dodged)<br>
<br>
- Expertise will convert that one dodge out of 100 attacks into a HIT.<br>
- Haste will make you attack 101 times, addint another SWING which can miss/crit/glance etc (and with 50% crit<br>
decent hit etc it just makes the "expected swing damage" higher then the "hit damage" by a lot.<br>
<br>
Thus while haste works with swings only it adds more to them then hit/expertise.</div>

well in fact you have to renew the rampage at perfect timmings to diminish the rage loss and you have to constantly be thinking of the rampage renew, losing focus on the combos.<br>

</div>Probably math explains it.<br>
<br>
a) DST. I have this trinket myself and i made countless tests with it + ran uptime meters during actual raids. It procs about instantly when the gcd is up which makes the uptime actually HIGHER then theoretical (10sec/10+25 of hidden cooldown =2/7). Theoretical uptime is a bit over 28%, in reality is closer to 30% because it procs within few sec of fight, then right after cooldown. On shorter fights its up slightly more then the 28%. Still, lets assume 28% only. This makes the trinket:<br>
<br>
40 ap 28%*325= 91 haste. <br>
<br>
b) TT. internal CD of 45 sec. 10% chance to proc of crit hit i believe (Thats an assumption, but close to what i see). Its expected to proc around 10 sec+ after internal cd is up meaning its 10/65= ~15% uptime. In fact i read on forums here the proc turns out to be about equal to 0.8PPM. If you take this calculations then the uptime is 8/60 =13,(3)%. Assuming 14% uptime the trinket ends up being<br>
<br>
10 hit 38 crit 340*14%= 48 ap.<br>
<br>
c) Berskers call 90 ap passive. 360 1/6 of the time. Assuming you time it perfectly with haste pots we can assume that the 360 is amplified by (i assume haste affects 70% of your dmg) 30%+70%*125% = 117.5% factor. Heroism impact depends on the length of the fight. Overall i like to assume the impact of the trinket is 25% more because of "comboing" it with other cooldowns. It ends up being<br>
<br>
90+125%*1/6*360 ap = 165 ap.<br>
<br>
removing the 40 ap from all trinkets we get :<br>
<br>
91 haste     VS     10 hit 38 crit 8 ap      VS               125 ap<br>
<br>
using MY sep values of :<br>
<br>
haste = 3ap<br>
hit = 1.4 ap<br>
crit = 2.4 ap<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
273 ap    vs      113 ap          vs           125 ap<br>
<br>
It turns out DST is twice as good as the other two trinkets.<br>
<br>
Possible things to influence the results:<br>
<br>
a) Gear/Raid composition. It was calculated using MY raid/gear. We have every possible melee buff always up as i noted few posts above. My crit is over 50% (although slightly) average ap is probably at 4500 counting hunter debuffs on mobs etc. This boosts the value of stats that I neither have on gear nor possible to boost through raid setup - aka haste. The only raid buff boosting haste is obviously heroism/haste pots. Note that we dont rotate heroisms so thats not above average for us. If someone raids without totem twisted GoA/feral/ret paladin, then his crit will be valued a lot higher (those together add to over 11% extra crit , and very often people dont have them). <br>
<br>
b) For slam warrior sometimes extra haste from DST , might interrupt slam rotations or just put the weapon below minimum speed. Again im DW fury.</div>

		<div id="post_message_635393">I think Shha's arguments are very right. Nevertheless, DST is since EVER the best trinket when you use the warrior spreadsheets, this is evidence enough, I think. You need to proof that the spreadsheets are wrong - otherwise DST is still the best trinket, and by a very solid margin. <br>
<br>
Also I guess you are underestimating haste and therefore DST... My personal thinking about haste is: it gives whole extra attacks over time. AP und Crit only make your attacks a bit stronger. So haste is a very strong stat that shouldn't be underestmated.</div>

</div>Well of course in THEORY haste is really good.  No one disputes the fact that with 1% haste you'd get an extra swing in ever 100.  In practice it's just too expensive, taking up other things on item budgets that would be better left as armor pen/str/crit.  I don't know the real numbers off the top of my head and I'm at work right now but let me just pose a theoretical question to you:<br>
If you had two identical pieces of armor with the same ilvl that had the same str/hit/sta/armor pen and the only difference was one offered 3% crit and the other offered 1% haste, which would you choose?  <br>
Yes, my numbers are intentionally skewed for the question because I'm trying to make the point that haste costs too much comparatively.  The real difference is much smaller but still there.  I would also like you to ponder that armor pen/str/crit increase the damage of ALL your attacks.  Haste does not improve the damage from Bloodthirst/Whirlwind.<br>

		<div id="post_message_635482">Haste is still hugely overrated imo.  Sure, you get faster attack speed, but at high levels of gear you don't need the rage, and it just becomes another HS every 100 swings, versus every one of your 100 swings doing more damage/critting more often.  I already have enough rage to basically spam my HS button the entire fight and never have to watch my rage to keep enough for bloodthirst/ww.  Of course there will be periods of dodge/miss streaks but the point is at high levels of gear the passive crit on TT, and the ability to stack Berzerker's Call with bloodlust/haste potion/drums/recklessness makes it far superior to a haste proc.</div>

		<div id="post_message_635496">Actually haste isn't really that expensive. I believe that it takes the same amount of haste rating for 1% as it does hit rating, ~15.8. Crit on the other hand is just about 22 per point. It's pretty easy to see how someone who has a 65-70% portion of they're damage coming from autoattack/HS to value haste as close to, or greater than crit.<br>
<br>
With every raid buff/debuff you can stack to boost melee your AP is going to be through the roof, and crit won't be far behind. This leaves armor pen, but honestly, looking at the stats on 2.4 itemization it looks like getting to a relatively high armor pen level while still gaining a large portion of haste won't be too difficult.</div>

</div>A Slam rotation is based around the swing timer. Haste directly reduces that swing timer. It does come at the cost of the other stats, in addition to aversely affecting rage generation: you swing faster, but lose crit, generate less rage per hit, while doing the rotation that more often. So <i>stacking</i> it is something I would refrain from, especially since good items with haste are rare. <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080214115832/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=33590"><span  ><span class="purplename">[Cloak of Fiends]</span></span></a> is very nice, and there's some leather/mail items that are efficient.</div>

</div>Well in your scenario of course the crit piece is better. Im not sure why even compare it like this though. 3% crit =66 crit rating. Ratings are ALL the same cost in item budget. So the other item would have 66 haste rating which equals to a bit over FOUR percent haste. So the real question would be - 3% crit or 4% haste, not 3% crit or 1% haste. <br>
<br>
Additionally Crit has diminishing returns. Going from 0% crit to 1% increases your dmg roughly by 1% (not counting impale etc). Going from 99% crit to 100% increases dmg by 0.5%. Also flurry uptime returns are much lower the more crit you have. Crit definitely outperforms haste at 0% crit, and it definitely loses at 100%. Somewhere in the middle is the equilibrum point, and while it depends on a lot of factors (rage generation, speed of weapons etc) and cant be calculated accurately in an easy way, its pretty safe to assume for T6+ warriors haste is ahead by a considerable margin.<br>
<br>
The reason you even posted the "3% crit or 1% haste" example is a simple derivation from BT gear. Honestly haste itemization in BT is awful. Items have usually only haste and str or haste hit str on them. Thats bad, simply because only 2 or 3 dps stats is always bad for item budget. They didnt have sockets - again it reduces the value of gear in general. Finally they had huge stamina, again eating the stats. THATS why haste is seen as very expensive - in fact its not, being that it costs only around 70% of crit per percent. <br>
<br>
<br>
Point about BT/WW is of course valid, however they only contribute to less then 30% of my damage. For slam/ms warriors its even better most of the time - IF you dont hit gcd cap on haste, it speeds up entire rotation working with 100% of your damaging moves.<br>

				 Quixotic  	Haste is still hugely overrated imo. Sure, you get faster attack speed, but at high levels of gear you don't need the rage, and it just becomes another HS every 100 swings, versus every one of your 100 swings doing more damage/critting more often. I already have enough rage to basically spam my HS button the entire fight and never have to watch my rage to keep enough for bloodthirst/ww. Of course there will be periods of dodge/miss streaks but the point is at high levels of gear the passive crit on TT, and the ability to stack Berzerker's Call with bloodlust/haste potion/drums/recklessness makes it far superior to a haste proc.

</div>Well problem is with raid buffs i have average of 5000 ap effectively. add 1400 for the weapon (converting the 100 dps weapon) and we talk about having 6400 effective AP. To increase the dmg of my swings by 1% i need to get 64 ap after UR/imp BS   so roughly 54 ap on gear. To increase the dmg through haste i need to get 1/0.7 = 1.43% of haste or 23 rating roughly. 23 rating is easier to get then 54 ap. <br>
<br>
As for passive crit on TT - like i said, im over 50% average crit in raids. Why would i really value some more that much? And dragonspine is hardly "random" to be honest - it procs within 5 sec of internal cooldown.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
To reiterate . I Definitely wouldnt advise anyone to stack haste with CURRENT haste gear. BT haste gear is just awful. and only because of pre-nerf haste domination it was even used. However Sunwell gear is a different story. The haste stuff there has sockets, has often crit, ArP, and a lot of valuable stats on it. Dont ignore it just because of awful BT items<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080214115832im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":)" class="inlineimg"></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Additionally Crit has diminishing returns. Going from 0% crit to 1% increases your dmg roughly by 1% (not counting impale etc). Going from 99% crit to 100% increases dmg by 0.5%. Also flurry uptime returns are much lower the more crit you have. Crit definitely outperforms haste at 0% crit, and it definitely loses at 100%. Somewhere in the middle is the equilibrum point, and while it depends on a lot of factors (rage generation, speed of weapons etc) and cant be calculated accurately in an easy way, its pretty safe to assume for T6+ warriors haste is ahead by a considerable margin.</div>

</div>I am curious what you use for your comparisons of what is better. You used SEP values earlier of haste = 3ap, hit = 1.4 ap, crit = 2.4 ap. 1 str would then also equal 2.2 ap with kings. I am having a hard time finding any gear that would give those values and is keeping white+heroic at 70%. If haste affects your HS, then that means your HS is limited by your MH speed rather than rage. To do this your OH alone would have to power your rage, is this what you do? This all seems contrary to most of what people and sheets say.<br>
<br>
That said, I dont think DST is worth twice as much as the others, but it is better. Its not so much that haste is powerful with it, just there is so much of it for a pretty consistent amount of time.</div>

As said before, haste is undervalued by the most people because they think "uh, haste *bad items with worse stats and huge stamina come to mind* - haste sucks". No haste don't sucks and there are more and more items which are very fine with haste. DST, Pillager's Gauntlets, Cloak of Fiends, Tuskbreaker, Heartless when you need a slow offhand is very nice, Swiftsteel Bludgeon at least for Execute-Phase, and more. <br>
<br>
When I exchange my DST with Berserkers Call, I have a loss in DPS of about 12 in Spreadsheet - this is huge. And bloodlust-phases won't change this, even considering your DST just don't procs in bloodlust-phases, it still is better. For me even Madness and TT are better than Berserkers Call. Madness has a high procrate, so it won't hurt your bloodlust-phases. I get the point, Berserkers Call is better to control, but thats all. The stats aren't a big shot.<br>
<br>
edit: to loderunner:<br>
<br>
Tuskbreaker VS. Ancient Amani Longbow, this is a excellent comparison to test how much haste "eats" from the itembudget:<br>
<br>
Both weapons are ilvl 132, both have 38 AP. Ancient Amani with 126 ArP and Tuskbreaker with 18 Hasterating. My spreadsheet shows a difference of about 0,8 DPS between them. Saying this, CoR and FF are activated. Without these debuffs the difference is even lower. So I don't think hasterating eats too much itembudget per DPS. Its about the same as ArP, Critrating etc.</div>

Well the SEP values come from the warrior dps spreadsheets on these forums. The amount of white + heroic seems to be pretty constant for me and just comes from my own recount/wws data. Basically on 7700 armor bosses where i have some rage problems its 44% white 26% heroic on last najentus, up to 42% heroic 29% white  on teron and other 6200 bosses. Given how fair share of the white is actually WF attacks, the actual Heroic Strike percentage is higher. <br>
<br>
Obviously those are rough numbers with fluctuations happening , but basically heroic seems to be in 25-45% range, and white+heroic always end up being close to 70%. Other damage is BT at around 13-14%, WW at 8 or so, deep wounds at 2-3 then executes. This is also another reason why i started to value ap a bit lower. Early on BT was a lot more % of my damage, so ap seemed better (BT dmg scales with 0.45 of your AP, while other hits scale with weapon damage + 0.24 of ap for 2h, and around 0,25-0,3 of ap with dual wield - depending on your hit). Now i mostly ignore BT "pecularities" when choosing gear, and focus on stuff that boosts my autoattack in first place.  Same deal with t6 - at first i thought that dropping some stats for 4 piece bonus might be somehow viable (i was never a BIG fan of it you know, but it felt that while 4 piece is pretty bad it just might slightly outperform stat loss), but not anymore. I wont even try to get 4 piece with new Sunwell pieces.</div>

</div>Well, yes, that's in line with how Armor Penetration is in general.  The higher the base amount of armor on the mob you're hitting is, the less Armor Penetration does.  That's why we have armor mitigating effects, debuffs, procs, and enchants that, when stacked, have a tremendous impact.  I also tend to think of examples like, how the <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080214115832/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=32526"><span  ><span class="purplename">[Band of Devastation]</span></span></a> turned, after the haste change, from the best dps ring hands down bar none to something on par with Malchezzar's <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080214115832/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=28757"><span  ><span class="purplename">[Ring of a Thousand Marks]</span></span></a>.

<br>
As for my Sunwell gear? Well so far it seems everything is an upgrade so ill slowly work towards that. All 3 new pieces of t6 are good, and all current one will be replaced (which means shoulders/chest as other have better stuff anyway). <br>
<br>
From there i had a dilemma - to use leather or not. I decided not to, for few reasons. <br>
<br>
- the difference seems to be very very small, and while i understand the idea of "dps above all" , I dont feel like sacrificing thousands of armor for 0.1% dps increase. <br>
- Plate is much easier to get<br>
- Some of the plate seems to be "converted" from tank gear. I found often its better for me to invest more in tanking gear for early progression, than dps gear. With the conversions its even easier to grab some tanking plate 1st then switch. <br>
<br>
So after that choice which indicates picking up BS, i decided to go with JC as well after using my enchanting on the boe JC ring. <br>
<br>
After that with BS chest/gloves JC neck/ring pauldrons of berserking crown of anastarian muramas/mounting vengeance etc i came up with stats of  2360ap in zerker (2050) 183 hit (187) 31,37% crit (35,05%) 1043 ArP (1330) and 232 haste (0). <br>
<br>
Overall as you can see i gain around 15% faster white attack. I lose 290 ArP but thats more then made up byb 310 ap boost. In fact the 290 ArP seems to increase my dmg by around 2-2.5% while amount of AP needed for that boost is close to 140 at most. That "leaves" 170 ap to deal with loss of approx 4% crit (i pulled hit loss in here), which is again a very good ratio Basically in terms of "typical" stats I lose a bit of dps but not much. However the 15% haste comes as pure "gain" from sunwell gear. That doesnt include sunwell trinkets and such.</div>

The idea being, that getting a weapon swing timer to 2.5sec means that you can essentially cycle slam -&gt; instant without fear of clipping the swing timer.<br>

</div>Well my previous statement was unclear on haste, I feel that anyone who uses haste other than DST now needs to look at how the items are itemized.  Haste is still an excellent item value in that it works off all your crit/AP/ArP/hit but I'm honestly at a loss on how to model it (and I don't think spreadsheets are right in how highly they value it in regards to warglaives, but that's a personal problem).<br>

I suppose it comes down to how much haste is on the 'ideal' fury warrior DPS set, and see how much total haste you have has on the new SEP value for haste, and we'll just have to wait on more items to come out to see.  I will say that other than the leatherworking BoE gloves there could potentially be only plate in the 'ideal' set, versus having Illidan helm/Archimonde chest as it stands now.</div>

		<div id="post_message_639989">Hey all, I've been having a lot of trouble with my crit rate on boss fights being much lower than what is reported in my character sheet for 25 man boss fights. I was hoping someone here might have an idea why. I have most of the best gear available to me now, and raid as 33/28/0 (currently the only DPS warrior in the guild). My character sheet has me at just below 32% to crit in zerker stance raid buffed without a feral. Most WWS reports and recount meters have been showing me between 20%-25% crit rate for boss fights for quite a while now (at least 6 weeks). Even with a feral, my crit rate has been coming through between 5%-10% lower than my character sheet.<br>
<br>
It had been suggested that not being hit capped is hurting my crit rate so I have been using the hit food lately, but that has not changed anything. A final note, this only seems to be happening in BT / Hyjal. I've done a few ZA runs and my crit rate has been relatively consistent with my character sheet there. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated!</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I think this is a really important point which has been largely ignored.  While total DPS is important, we also need to consider total threat.  Assuming you had enough rage to use BT and WW every time they're up (and keep your shout and rampage up) additional hits from haste will increase your white damage AND your HS damage (since you’ll have extra rage to dump), thereby increasing threat.  It seems to me that as HS counts for a higher and higher percent of your total damage, while your theoretical DPS increases, you will become limited by threat.<br>
<br>
Also, on a similar note, fast or slow MH? A slow MH will clearly increase your WW damage, but a fast MH will increase your HS damage since HS costs less rage when used with a faster weapon--&gt;HS with a slow 2 hander costs 15 (or 12) PLUS the rage you WOULD have gotten for the foregone white hit (maybe 30 for a 2 hander...a total of 45 rage for 208 damage).  If you're swinging a 1.5 second rogue off-hand-type weapon, your HS will only cost 15+maybe 10 rage for the same 208 bonus damage.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I think both of these issues (haste and slow vs. fast MH) are both somewhat related as they both pertain to the concept of being threat capped (something that doesn't show on a spreadsheet) as the percentage of your total damage done by HS steadily increases.<br>
<br>
Thoughts on how to measure this? Gut feelings?</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</div>HS adds a bonus amount of threat per use.  It adds a varying amount of damage per use.  The damage added is a summation of the bonus damage on the swing plus the reduction to miss, elimination of glancing, and the magnification of the crits due to impale.  At certain levels of gearing, I think it has been shown that the damage added aside from the base talent bonus damage can dwarf the bonus damage.  I've had 3k HS crits.  The impale damage on that swing alone would be 272.  Thus, getting as much damage per usage actually improves your damage/aggro ratio.  Thus, a slower weapon, while costing proportionately more rage, is my preference.<br>
<br>
When evaluting haste, I always take it as a ratio to hit rating as the perform similarly.  Over a 100 swing timed period, 1% hit will net you one weapon damage.  1% haste will net you one swing event.  Now, under most circumstances, 1 swing event even after misses and glances, is more than 1 hit event in damage.  When you mix in that a percentage of attacks are HS instead of hits, the value of haste inflates.  I don't at current use any haste gear largely because it is poorly itemized, but come 2.4 I should be picking some up.<br>
<br>
I do wonder how people average 5k attack power in a raid.  I raid with a sapphire on (2112 base AP in zerker) with an enh shaman and the highest AP I have ever hit was 5280.  I average over 4000 pretty cleanly but I need a WF proc with Zerker Call up to top 5k.  I wonder where I am missing out on all this extra AP.  Of the couple T6 instance drops I could still get, none represent a serious AP increase.  2112 is a decent start.</div>

</div>Yeah, that's pretty similar to how I approach haste, though just because I don't actively aim for +hit, doesn't mean I discount it completely.<br>
<br>
I've been trying to compare haste to hit to find an acceptable comparison ratio.<br>
<br>
As Grymm said, haste gives you an extra swing, rather than hit, and that swing has a chance to crit - however it also has a chance to miss, or be dodged or parried. Generally DPS warriors don't run with much expertise, but then ideally we're attacking from behind so parry shouldn't really be an issue.<br>
<br>
So, if we say 1 unit is the damage from an extra hit, then the extra swing from haste will give us (1 + 1*crit - 1*dodge - 1*miss) damage, where crit, dodge, miss are your respective chances (in decimal form - eg. 0.35 for 35% crit).<br>
<br>
In order for haste to be better than hit, you need crit &gt; dodge + miss, where miss is going to be the default boss miss chance (0.27 or something?) minus your +hit. Dodge change is 0.056 I think for bosses, so you get something like:<br>
<br>
crit &gt; 0.056 + 0.27 - hit<br>
crit + hit &gt; 0.326<br>
<br>
So that is, if you have total crit and plus hit of more than 32.6% (which I assume *every* dps warrior will have), then haste is generally going to be better than hit. The exact ratio will vary, but the more crit and hit you have the better haste will be.<br>
<br>
Note: This is a very simplified form of the equation - it doesn't take into account haste you already have (stacking haste should increase the value of hit compared to additional haste), it doesnt account for expertise (I assumed 0), and it also doesn't take into account the harder to define aspects of hit and haste (ie. hit should give more PPM procs, haste (as far as I understand it) won't. They'll also affect rage generation in different ways (whilst the overall rage gain will be the same, the 'smoothness' of rage generation won't be).<br>
<br>
For 2H warriors (I'm DW), I'm assuming you'll be capped already so this comparison is rather pointless, it's rather clear that haste is better than hit once you have 9%.<br>
<br>
<b>Edit:</b> Also I assumed a 2x modifier for crit damage, if you run with <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080218185146/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=32409"><span  ><span class="bluename">[Relentless Earthstorm Diamond]</span></span></a> (I do), then that will also increase the value of haste in relation to hit.</div>

</div>Thanks Grymm, your comments were really insightful.  However, although it is very clear that your damage/threat ratio is higher with a slower MH, this is sort of the obvious conclusion.  The more significant question in this debate is whether that matters or not.  If you do more total damage with a fast OH rogue sword but never become threat capped, then damage/threat ratio becomes immaterial.<br>
<br>
Let's take threat out of the equation for a minute.  If you're swinging a faster weapon, does the extra Heroic Strike damage even make up for the decreased Whirlwind damage?  If it doesn't then we can conclude that a slower weapon is ALWAYS better regardless of any threat calculations.  Only if the faster weapon proves to do more damage do we even need to think about threat.<br>
<br>
Is there any way to do the maths to get at this question? I'm not the most inclined number cruncher, nor do I even know the threat formulas.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Hey all, I've been having a lot of trouble with my crit rate on boss fights being much lower than what is reported in my character sheet for 25 man boss fights. I was hoping someone here might have an idea why. I have most of the best gear available to me now, and raid as 33/28/0 (currently the only DPS warrior in the guild). My character sheet has me at just below 32% to crit in zerker stance raid buffed without a feral. Most WWS reports and recount meters have been showing me between 20%-25% crit rate for boss fights for quite a while now (at least 6 weeks). Even with a feral, my crit rate has been coming through between 5%-10% lower than my character sheet.<br>
<br>
It had been suggested that not being hit capped is hurting my crit rate so I have been using the hit food lately, but that has not changed anything. A final note, this only seems to be happening in BT / Hyjal. I've done a few ZA runs and my crit rate has been relatively consistent with my character sheet there. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated!</div>

	</tr>
	</table>
</div>Whoever mentioned critcap to you is wrong, it's ~(45%+ your hit) from behind. <br>
<br>
You might want to link to your WWS so we can check, but my thoughts would either be bad luck (unlikely over that long) or you're not attacking the boss from behind.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Yeah, that's pretty similar to how I approach haste, though just because I don't actively aim for +hit, doesn't mean I discount it completely.<br>
<br>
I've been trying to compare haste to hit to find an acceptable comparison ratio.<br>
<br>
As Grymm said, haste gives you an extra swing, rather than hit, and that swing has a chance to crit - however it also has a chance to miss, or be dodged or parried. Generally DPS warriors don't run with much expertise, but then ideally we're attacking from behind so parry shouldn't really be an issue.<br>
<br>
So, if we say 1 unit is the damage from an extra hit, then the extra swing from haste will give us (1 + 1*crit - 1*dodge - 1*miss) damage, where crit, dodge, miss are your respective chances (in decimal form - eg. 0.35 for 35% crit).<br>
<br>
In order for haste to be better than hit, you need crit &gt; dodge + miss, where miss is going to be the default boss miss chance (0.27 or something?) minus your +hit. Dodge change is 0.056 I think for bosses, so you get something like:<br>
<br>
crit &gt; 0.056 + 0.27 - hit<br>
crit + hit &gt; 0.326<br>
<br>
So that is, if you have total crit and plus hit of more than 32.6% (which I assume *every* dps warrior will have), then haste is generally going to be better than hit. The exact ratio will vary, but the more crit and hit you have the better haste will be.<br>
<br>
Note: This is a very simplified form of the equation - it doesn't take into account haste you already have (stacking haste should increase the value of hit compared to additional haste), it doesnt account for expertise (I assumed 0), and it also doesn't take into account the harder to define aspects of hit and haste (ie. hit should give more PPM procs, haste (as far as I understand it) won't. They'll also affect rage generation in different ways (whilst the overall rage gain will be the same, the 'smoothness' of rage generation won't be).<br>
<br>
For 2H warriors (I'm DW), I'm assuming you'll be capped already so this comparison is rather pointless, it's rather clear that haste is better than hit once you have 9%.<br>
<br>
<b>Edit:</b> Also I assumed a 2x modifier for crit damage, if you run with <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080218185146/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=32409"><span  ><span class="bluename">[Relentless Earthstorm Diamond]</span></span></a> (I do), then that will also increase the value of haste in relation to hit.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</div>The thing you also have to take into account is excess rage generation.  On fights with incoming damage like Teron, with good gear I don't even have to look at my rage half the time and still have enough to keep bloodthirst/whirlwind/rampage/battle shout on cooldown and spam heroic strike basically non-stop.<br>
<br>
In that situation 1% hit would give me a small amount of rage (assuming it gives me an off-hand hit), versus 1% haste giving me another heroic strike.  Just another factor to compare, it's all very complicated with how streaky the rage mechanic is and what group buffs you typically get when choosing how to gear.</div>

It's a good fight to benchmark maximum DPS posibilities, but only because the rage is almost free flowing and without pause, so a hit deficiency or the benefits of haste won't really show up as much.  The majority of fights are nowhere near that.  Patchwerk was by far the best test, but there aren't really any fights like that at the moment.  Maybe we will have a chance to do it again come the expansion if they don't change that fight too much.</div>

</div>Teron isn't the only fight with almost 'infinite' rage though. I've found on fights like Shahraz and Anetheron I can also pretty much spam HS non-stop, and my gear is nowhere near as good as Quixotic's.<br>
<br>
All the little extra things like heroic strike rates, smoothness of rage gain, optimal execute spam etc. all complicate the accurate evaluation of haste - my brief maths above was purely to look at the base white damage, to at least have a starting point which we can then build on qualitatively.<br>
<br>
In a theoretical infinte rage scenario, the value of hit drops to almost nothing (as it will only affect offhand white swings), whilst the value of haste will raise (as the damage of each mainhand hit is higher due to heroic strike bonus damage and the reduced miss chance.</div>

</div>I'm referring to the ability to generate rage for an execute every global cooldown (1.5 seconds). Having to wait more than 1.5 seconds is not optimal, since excess rage is converted to damage at a lower rate than the initial hit. With slower weapons, haste helps get the speed of your MH down to 1.5 so that it's generating enough rage each hit. Also, it helps your offhand - fast offhands generally don't generate enough rage for an execute on their hit, so you want a slow offhand, but then haste helps smooth out the rage from that.<br>
<br>
It's not the kind of thing you can really put numbers to easily, but it helps.</div>

</div>I'd actually like to see this math if possible, too. Because from what I know WF totem is already normalized (and has no cooldown either unlike WF weapon enchants) so does it really matter what speed your weapon is? Regardless of speed it will hit 20% more often (with added AP bonus); slow weapons will obviously hit harder on an extra attack but faster weapons will trigger extra attacks more often - which should make it wash. Or am I missing something here?</div>

</div>Interesting... when I still played my main, as fury, I would aim to generate as much rage as possible during execute range in order to get the excess to contribute to dps. The whole goal was to see 90-100rage Executes top off above 7k dmg every GCD if possible. (Which happened *fairly* often with trink/zerk/flurry/haste pot/recklessness/drums/haste proc/WF/lust if not already used)<br>
You suggest an opposing senario? Generate only what you need for Execute- burn the rest off with HStrike, while keeping BT/WW going?<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Interesting... when I still played my main, as fury, I would aim to generate as much rage as possible during execute range in order to get the excess to contribute to dps. The whole goal was to see 90-100rage Executes top off above 7k dmg every GCD if possible. (Which happened *fairly* often with trink/zerk/flurry/haste pot/recklessness/drums/haste proc/WF/lust if not already used)<br>
You suggest an opposing senario? Generate only what you need for Execute- burn the rest off with HStrike, while keeping BT/WW going?<br>

</div>What I'm suggesting is that 2x15rage executes are better damage than 1x30 rage execute, or to take it an extreme, 6x15rage executes are far better than 1x90 rage execute. If you compare the ratio 15rage : Execute base damage, you'll find that you get a lot more bang for your buck than the extra rage over the 15. 'Saving' rage for executes is not worth it, you should do your full cycle until 19%, and then start hammering Execute as soon as it lights up each GCD. If you manage to spike to over 30rage, you should probably use bloodthirst rather than execute that GCD, as with decent levels of gear bloodthirst is better than a 30+ rage execute.</div>

</div>Oh, I wasnt meaning to imply that I thought I was anywhere near being crit capped.. just that with my current DPS gear, I was not hit capped unless I had a food buff up, but being hit capped again didnt change anything. The only WWS report I have is from finishing up Hyjal. I had a feral for this raid so my character sheet crit rate would have been just under 37%.<br>

Azgalor and Archimonde kills are in that report too, and my crit rate was painfully low on all attacks here, although I did roll well on ww's for this report, only outta 5 though! 22% on MS, 27% on slam, 31% on white attacks, all well below the 37% that I should have. And yes, I am always attacking from behind. :P</div>

</div>The BT:Exec ratios I'm familiar with. The clarification on 2x15 vs. 1x30 was a perfect example for your argument. Interesting viewpoint.<br>
<br>
I'm curious- how do fury warriors justify their 25man raid slots these days? The only fury warriors I've ran into are diehard guildies of guilds that have been around since pre-bc. Thier slot isn't won with talent or mathmatical backing- but off of loyalty and consistency.<br>
It takes no skill to PvP as MS- a solid 2H and you are a force to be reckoned with. Now, raiding has taken the same turn with BF alone being too great an asset with as little as 5-6 physical dps present.<br>
I've always viewed the fury warrior as a group buffing, rogue-like DPSer but with a 20% burn niche. Where's the benefit in 2 in a raid (Spriests are 'niche' but highly useful in quantity. Feral druids arguably 'niche' but also highly useful in quantity. 2 Enh shams are possible with 1 melee group and 1 tanking group (threat)...) much less bringing a single one when you have BF you're missing out on?<br>
Short of this being 'QQ': What is the [Warrior] Future of the *Fury* DPS Warrior?</div>

</div>Clarification: arms warrior or fury warrior of equal 'talent' or 'skill'.<br>
<br>
Edit: In some cases, actually, yes. Just having BF active outweighs the difference in personal DPS by signification margins. Assuming arms does 80% of fury's DPS (80% is very conservative), and assuming a baseline 1k DPS by all other DPSers:<br>
1: 1k ~&gt; 1040<br>
2: 1k ~&gt; 1040<br>
3: 1k ~&gt; 1040<br>
4: 1k ~&gt; 1040<br>
5: 1k ~&gt; 1040<br>
6(you) 800<br>
TOTAL: 6k<br>
Obviously 1k from each, plus 1k from yourself if you were fury yields the same results. Keep in mind you'll have 2 tanks (minimum) benefitting from BF, and usually some hunters + their pets to factor in as well... ya, if the BF debuffer knew how to stay alive, his personal DPS is rather insignificant. Just slap up the debuff and thanks for your service to your country. Assuming you do 80% of a similarly played/geared fury, just having 5 or so other physical dps present makes you far more attractive.</div>

</div>The same way rogues do - DPS. In my experience, a well-played, well-geared fury warrior is competitive with a similarly-geared, similarly-played rogue, and we also bring battle shout, imp demo shout and (when we have a non-warrior tank) sunder.<br>
<br>
However, as you have pointed out, an Arms warrior brings all this and more, and well played arms warriors (From what I've read) do not lag behind fury much in personal dps. In this sense, if you're optimizing for raid dps, bring one arms warrior would be better than bringing one fury warrior.<br>
<br>
In my guild, we have only one arms warrior, who mostly PvPs and doesn't raid regularly. It's not an option to take him to every raid, and so I get taken most of the time because a fury warrior is better than another rogue. Not taking at least 1 dps warrior of any kind is just awful - your melee group WANTS battle shout. A lot of people underestimate Battle shout, but talented with sapphire it's over 500 attack power. To get that much from Unleashed rage (which is also isnt quite up 100% of the time) you'd need 5000 attack power, which as has been discussed is basically out of reach barring trinkets+WF.<br>
<br>
Now, I guess from a min-maxing point of view, it would make sense for me to spec arms instead, but when it comes down to it, I absolutely detest the playstyle of arms, and I find it completely boring in raids. Yes, that is a completely selfish reason, but when it comes down to it, I raid for fun, and for me, that is fury (or prot - I also really enjoy tanking and I regularly respec prot when we're low on tanks), but not arms. I don't feel bad about it because I'm generally in the top 5 on DPS, mostly top 3 except fights which really don't favour melee. On fights which do favour melee, I often reach first, particularly if they're warrior friendly (Akama, Solarian, etc.)<br>
<br>
So, it comes down to this. A fury warrior is still an excellent use of a raid spot. An arms warrior is (perhaps) a slightly more excellent use of a raid spot. Use them appropriately.</div>

MS warriors, therefore, benefit much more from this totem than DW fury warriors do.<br>
<br>
I'm glad someone mentioned this because it relates to my question as to whether a DW fury warrior wants a fast or slow MH.  A slower MH will definitely deal more damage from WF, and I'm now adding that to my calculus.  However, and I don't think this is too related to total DPS, what drives my crazy now (I'm currently MS spec'd) is all the "wasted rage" I have from WF procs--when they crit, I soar up to 100 rage every time it seems :P<br>
<br>
Another thing that relates to this discussion is the idea of "optimal executes."  Clearly faster weapons are better in this case.  Man this is tricky...<br>
<br>
(BTW, on this note, do MS warriors even find it optimal to use Execute over Slam when a boss is under 20%? I mean when I’m trying to burn down a boss in the last 20%, I do NOT execute spam, I simply replace Mortal Strike with Execute in my cycle—that is I continue to use Slam after every hit).<br>
<br>
Pros of a slow MH:<br>
<br>
Higher WW damage.<br>
More Added damage from WF totem.<br>
More added damage from Impale (applies only to WW and Heroic Strike).<br>
Probably less threat intensive since Heroic Strike isn’t a major source of damage.<br>
<br>
Cons of a slow MH:<br>
<br>
More expensive Heroic Strikes, therefore total Heroic Strike damage is decreased.<br>
Might not be "execute optimal" (especially when paired with a slow OH, which by the way, I’m always looking to get—besides for execute phase, a slow OH is ALWAYS better it seems to me).<br>
<br>
Anyway, since I'm used to consistently raiding with an enhancement sham, I'm going to conclude that DW fury warriors should roll with slower MH weapons.  I still haven't seen any numbers that show this to do more damage.  However, when you take threat into account, faster weapons look even uglier.<br>
<br>
Again, if anyone can get the maths on Heroic Strike threat and the other relevant damage comparisons, that would be excellent!</div>

</div>But if the sheet shows twice as much WF damage from a slow mainhand that cant be attributed to only #1<br>
Also if #1 is correct then the conclusion that MS warriors benefit more from WF due to their slow weaponspeed than fury does is also incorrect in that MS are likely to do less heroic strikes. (Im not factoring in the other reasons why WF may be better for MS warriors here)</div>

In that case slow weapons would probably have more total 'swings' relative to its average weapon speed and damage and as such would be more potent. Another thing like this would be if WF was modeled as a PPM mechanic instead of a flat proc-chance, but that also seems unlikely. Again, I realize these two things are rather 'duh, of course we modeled it right', but since the big difference seems to be such a mystery I felt I might as well suggest it.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I wasn't able to get access to the old forums where this was orginally pencilled in, but here is a recreated example that illustrates the benefits of WF for a 1H vs 2H.<br>
<br>
Take standard widespread examples: s3 weapons.<br>
1H stats: 2.60spd 187-349dmg 103.1dps<br>
2H stats: 3.60spd 386-580dmg 134.2dps<br>
<br>
Things to remember: WF proc only happens on the MH while DWing and obviously on a 2H. Furthermore, attack power is normalized right around where these speeds register (been a while since remembering what the 3 speeds are for dagger, 1H, 2H but the general gist is we assume AP influence is equal due to normalization).<br>
We'll ignore flurry, chance to miss, other haste procs etc. We'll assume the DWing warrior will proc 5/5 Flurry more often but miss an amount that brings it equal to the 2H (MS/BF) procing 3/5 Flurry but never missing.<br>
<br>
Common denominator to match swings: 26 x 36 = 936. We'll say (for a nice chunk of time) we sample 93.6s of an encounter and the encounter behaves perfectly according to the law of averages. Napkin math if you will.<br>
<br>
1H:<br>
Swings exactly 36 times inside this window.<br>
Avg hit is (187+349)/2 = 268.<br>
<br>
WF proc is .2 x 36 = 7.2 times inside this window.<br>
<br>
Normal dmg due to MH: 9648<br>
Additional dmg due to WF proc: 1929.6<br>
<br>
2H:<br>
Swings exactly 26 times inside this window.<br>
Avg hit is (386+580)/2 = 483.<br>
<br>
WF proc is .2 x 26 = 5.2 times inside this window.<br>
<br>
Normal dmg due to 2H: 12558<br>
Additional dmg due to WF proc: 2511<br>
<br>
Difference in gains between the 1H/2H: 43.45 / 56.54<br>
<br>
Of course, if there are any issues with the math or I'm forcing the numbers in a certain way, please point it out.<br>
Noteworthy: this is for WF totem only. Arguably a 17/44 warrior will make more use of an Enh Sham overall than a 33/28 due to BT being the rage burn and it scaling directly with AP which the Enh Sham provides in bulk.</div>

</div>You went an awful long way to say awfully little. You also didn't really say it right (though your conclusion is pretty much correct). Normalization doesn't come into this, WF is not normalized it's just an extra attack. As I proved earlier in the thread, Weapon speed is *irrelevant* to WF dps. A theoretical 1.0 speed 2hander would gain just as much from WF as a 5.0 speed 2hander.<br>
<br>
All it comes down to is one simple thing: WF affects mainhand only. Ergo, you're comparing a ~100dps 1her against a ~130dps 2her, hence 2her wins. Simple. Done. The end.</div>

</div>(Emphasis mine)<br>
<br>
As far as I am aware, AP does not and never has affected 2h differently from 1h. You do not innately gain more damage from AP on a 2h than you do on a 1her. This is one of the main strengths of Dual-wield, though is largely counterbalanced by the offhand damage penalty and increased miss chance of DW.<br>
<br>
I'm going to run through my understanding of attack power mechanics - this is not meant to be patronizing or condascending, I just want to lay out exactly what I mean.<br>
<br>
Attack power affects white damage by the formula of AP/14 dps. This is to say, that 14 attack power gives 1 dps to each weapon you wield. If you are wielding a 2h, your weapon gains 1 dps. If you're dual-wielding, both weapons gain 1dps (obviously on the offhand this works out as 0.5dps, or 0.625 with DW spec, but it's still applied as a base 1 dps). For the purposes of auto-attack swings, this dps is converted into damage by multiplying with the weapon speed. This is *not* normalized. A 2.8 speed weapon gains 2.8 damage per hit, a 3.6 2h gains 3.6 damage per hit, and a 1.4 weapon gains 1.4damage per hit.<br>
<br>
Windfury is a 20% chance to proc an extra attack, with a bonus attack power. That's a flat 20%, not a PPM based chance, so a slow weapon will naturally get less procs. It's effectively like having 20% more white swings in any given period. Now, the attack power will increase the damage of the windfury swings, but again, this is not normalized. Imagine that you have two warriors with different speed weapons that both do the same white damage. Now 'set aside' 20% of their damage. If their total damage is equal, then 20% of each person's damage must be equal too. This shows us the value of their WF damage pre-bonus AP. Now consider that for this 20%, both players AP is increased by the same bonus value. As we said earlier, AP adds DPS, and will add the same white dps regardless of weapon speed, so both totals will go up by the same amount.<br>
<br>
You can prove this algebraically as I did earlier - the weapon speed term will drop out and the final result will be independent of speed.<br>
<br>
As I said before, the reason WF benefits 2h more is simply that the DPS value of the 2h is higher than that on the 1h, on a ratio of approximately 130:100. The DW miss factor also affects it, but weapon speed does not. If you look at 1h only, a 1.4speed mainhand benefits equally as well as a 2.8speed one.<br>

</div>It depends on what you mean by 'near'. If you mean 90%+, then no, it's not.<br>
<br>
The best way to approximate flurry uptime (it's a bit more complicated than this) is 1-(1-c)^x where c is your crit chance, expressed as decimal (eg. 0.35 for 35%) and x is your average number of hits per flurry cycle, ie. 3 + your instants per 3 auto-attacks. 4 is a fairly standard number for X.<br>
<br>
In that case, using a 35% crit rate you get an estimated uptime of: 0.821 or 82%<br>
Using a 40% crit rate yields: 0.870 or 87%</div>

</div>I'd argue 5 would be a standard number for X with windfury in mind, unless windfury consumes flurry charges. But even in that case, we still only reach 93% uptime.<br>
<br>
Has anyone looked at the impact of resilience when comparing S3 items to normal PvE items? Resilience allows Enrage to proc off completely random damage that doesn't crit. Think Gorefiend/Shahraz. Vael would be the best example of what I'm thinking of.<br>
<br>
With that in mind, I was also trying to think of a way to take steady damage that could proc Enrage. Is there a debuff or potion or anything of the sort?<br>
<br>
On another note, does anyone disagree, with the item budget in mind, that armor penetration &gt; expertise &gt; crit &gt; strength &gt; attack power &gt; hit?</div>

</div>It does. Somewhere toward the middle of this thread this was cemented.<br>
<br>
While on this topic, this is yet another reason sword spec &gt; axe spec. For simplicity's sake:<br>
Swing with axe: axe spec yields a crit, simultaneously you proc WF. You now have 2 Flurry charges.<br>
Swing with sword: sword spec yields an additional hit, simultaneously you proc WF. You still have 3 Flurry charges.<br>
<br>
In both cases you do double damage. However a regularly procced sword proc aligned with WF (no crit) gives you double the damage but you retain all Flurry charges.<br>
<br>
Edit: my warrior has 4/5 s3 (no shoulders). While I will admit the resilience is nice for survivability when at times things go a bit haywire, I cannot say I've seen random Enrage procs very much unless I was dps-tanking trash. The only reason why I had sought s3 was because I was stuck at t5 level so long, and s3 &gt; t5 (esp since the t5 bonuses suck for DW). Basically: I wouldn't recommend s3 unless you don't have access to the pve equivalent. Too many stat points wasted on resil/stam/armor.</div>

</div>I seem to remember discussing this before and someone pasting a combat log which seemed to show that windfury consumes flurry charges.<br>
<br>
Ignoring Windfury for now:<br>
<br>
You Get 1/6 bloodthirsts per second, and 2/10 whirlwinds (since each hand hits), for approximately 0.4 specials per second. You get 1/mh and 1/oh auto attacks. A flurry cycle is going to be 3(1/mh + 1/0h) seconds long, or for 2 matched 2.6 speed weapons, 3.9seconds, for about 1.6 specials. However, due to flurry itself, the time is actually compressed - for a pair of 2.6 weapons it becomes 3.12 seconds, giving about 1.2 specials.<br>
<br>
The fact that flurry uptime affects the ratio of instants:autoattacks which affects flurry uptime is one of the main things that makes flurry modeling difficult, but I think this is a good way of approximating it.<br>
<br>
I personally don't raid with a feral druid in the melee group. We get an Enh shaman and sometimes a Ret Paladin, and the Enh shaman rarely twists, so I get +3% from the judgement and that puts my effective crit somewhere around 35%, which should put my flurry uptime somewhere around the low 80s. It's good, but it's not really near 100%.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I seem to remember discussing this before and someone pasting a combat log which seemed to show that windfury consumes flurry charges.<br>
<br>
Ignoring Windfury for now:<br>
<br>
You Get 1/6 bloodthirsts per second, and 2/10 whirlwinds (since each hand hits), for approximately 0.4 specials per second. You get 1/mh and 1/oh auto attacks. A flurry cycle is going to be 3(1/mh + 1/0h) seconds long, or for 2 matched 2.6 speed weapons, 3.9seconds, for about 1.6 specials. However, due to flurry itself, the time is actually compressed - for a pair of 2.6 weapons it becomes 3.12 seconds, giving about 1.2 specials.<br>
<br>
The fact that flurry uptime affects the ratio of instants:autoattacks which affects flurry uptime is one of the main things that makes flurry modeling difficult, but I think this is a good way of approximating it.<br>
<br>
I personally don't raid with a feral druid in the melee group. We get an Enh shaman and sometimes a Ret Paladin, and the Enh shaman rarely twists, so I get +3% from the judgement and that puts my effective crit somewhere around 35%, which should put my flurry uptime somewhere around the low 80s. It's good, but it's not really near 100%.</div>

</div>Yeah I didn't expect windfury to consume flurry. That's pretty counter intuitive.</div>

</div>I might have explained that wrong. 10hrs of sleep all week is having adverse affects on my brain. Many apologies. I should probably stop posting until I'm rested.<br>
Axe spec will crit yielding double the damage. Coupled with WF you lose the benefit of critting due to consumed Flurry.<br>
Sword spec will proc yielding double the damage. Coupled with WF you lose no benefits unless it crits. However, if it crits, you do 4x your usual damage where axe only does 3x<br>
swing(100%)+ss proc crit(200%)+WF(100%) = 400%<br>
axe proc(200%)+WF(100%) = 300%<br>
<br>
Edit: what I just posted has no bearing on WF totem come to think of it.</div>

		<div id="post_message_650576">I'd like to toss something out there that is perhaps off the current conversation track.  A few pages back I posted in this thread (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080226161752/http://elitistjerks.com/561721-post2329.html" target="_blank">here</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080226161752/http://elitistjerks.com/561830-post2334.html" target="_blank">here</a>) seeking advice with my spec/rotations - at the time I was mace specced wielding a torch with some ArP but not stacking it heavily.<br>
<br>
I've since had a number of gear upgrades and playstyle changes.  I picked up a Cataclysm's Edge and went swords.  I switched over to 4pc T6 with heavy ArP stacking.  I've tried a 31/30 spec without Improved Slam and managed to get some fairly high DPS numbers (in the 1600's) simply by using HS at the right time and focussing on my proper rotations.<br>
<br>
The biggest impact I noticed, though - and I apologise if i'm retreading ground here - is that a good execute phase basically defines what your final numbers look like on WWS.  Well timed Death Wish, Recklessness, and the use of Haste Pots make an absolutely enormous difference.  In my previous post in this thread, I was wondering how I get so handily beaten on meters?  I discovered the answer was bad execute phases.  I wasn't using my Death Wish right, I wasn't using Recklessness nor haste potions.  My numbers shot up as soon as I started focussing on timing cooldowns for 19% and execute spam.  I guess this is basic stuff to some but when I was Slam I tried to continue the rotation sub 19% as has been suggested and I didn't find it working for me.<br>
<br>
This led me to try Improved Disciplines in a 31/30 spec with Improved Execute and 2pc t6, to extend the duration of Recklessness and make Execute as cheap as possible.  I now feel that Improved Disciplines is actually an underrated talent.  Typically there's about 15-20 minutes of travel and or trash between bosses, so I found that 2/3 and 3/3 both worked well for me.  You have to "waste" at least two points somewhere to get to MS anyway, ever since they moved Weapon Mastery those two points went into Improved Intercept, which doesn't help my DPS one bit.  Improved Disciplines does help, however trivially.  Basically I tweaked for longer Recklessness Executes, and found that that did work.<br>
<br>
Finally I settled on my current build: a 31/30 MS spec that has Improved Disciplines, Improved Execute, Improved Slam and Weapon Mastery.  To get this I sacrificed a point in Sword Specialization (4/5), a point in Flurry (4/5) and Sweeping Strikes.  I don't have Blood Frenzy and have yet to try it in this combination; I would be interested to see how it pans out, but it would drop me to 2/5 Flurry.  By speccing into Improved Slam, I am able to sustain a high dps rotation until 19%, and by having Improved Disciplines, Improved Execute and 2pc t6, I activate 21 seconds of reckless cheap execute spam as soon as heroism is popped sub-19% with a haste pot thrown in to extend or add to the heroism.  Using this spec, I have set some personal records on Gorefiend, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080226161752/http://wowwebstats.com/x1ja16g4wyys3?s=4850-5055" target="_blank">just shy of 1800</a> last week in the melee dps group with an enhancement shaman, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080226161752/http://wowwebstats.com/dojlbn5tlgd4u?s=6790-7004" target="_blank">similar this week</a> in the MT group with a restoration shaman + feral druid w/drums of battle.<br>
<br>
Not sure what else to say, really.. my goal in posting this, if anything, was to relate what seems to be working for me, in the hope that it might help others along.  I feel that Improved Disciplines is a little underrated, maybe not if you're learning encounters because it won't be up every attempt anyway, but when pushing through a raid instance it helps to have it available for each boss fight and the extended duration is especially nice.  Having both Improved Slam and Improved Execute is something that I find to be a lot more valuable in a practical sense, as i'm not tied to continuing the Slam rotation, but can change things up and fall back on simply keeping MS/WW/HS on cooldown or execute spam sub 19%.</div>

		<div id="post_message_650608">Firstly, I assume you already have a warrior spec'd for Blood Frenzy.  Otherwise the taking 2 points out of Flurry and putting them in to Blood Frenzy would be a HUGE boost to raid DPS compared to the little amount of DPS that you would lose personally.<br>
<br>
Secondly, you have Imp. Slam, 4/5 Sword Spec., 4/5 Flurry and no Sweeping Strikes?  With a 3.5 speed sword?  Yet you don't use Slam rotations anyway?  So, you're spec'd towards maximizing non-Slam rotation based DPS but you put 2 points in to Imp. Slam and not Flurry or Sweeping Strikes (which is a huge damage increase on any AoE fight).<br>
<br>
Could you clarify, please?</div>

<br>
I use Slam rotations until 19% then, since I usually get Heroism around that time (depending on the fight, sometimes it's earlier than that) I revert to straight reckless execute.  The number of uses for Sweeping Strikes on a boss fight (that i've seen; sunwell notwithstanding) is minimal.  I miss SS a great deal on Hyjal clears, but.. hey, it's trash.<br>
<br>
Perhaps I didn't word my post right, what I meant to relate was that originally I was slam spec, and got reasonable DPS but was consistently beaten; I tried "tweaking for execute" and discovered it stronger with well timed cooldowns but bad if you dont pop everything for execution.  Finally i'm trying a marriage of the two specs, improved slam with which I do the standard rotation for sustained dps, then disciplines+imp.execute for execute phase spam and abandonment of the slam rotation (under the right conditions).  It's sort of a shot at best of both worlds that seems to be working out for me.</div>

		<div id="post_message_650628">Kind of on that topic, the last couple of days I've been considering the viability of a sword-spec DW build.<br>
<br>
Now, I know most people's first reaction is going to be something along the lines of 'lolwut?' People looked at them a long time ago when TBC first came out, and it seemed to be fairly clear that Rampage and Imp Zerker stance etc. came out ahead. However, from what I remember of these comparisons, they were all before the Death Wish change. Now, I have to admit that I absolutely love Death Wish, it's one of my favourite talents and I hate that they moved it, but it gave me the idea to re-evaluate a 26/35 build. In these days of cooldown stacking and short fights, Death Wish seems like it should be stronger than ever. Bloodlust + Death Wish + Recklessness + Haste Potion should be good times. The question is, is it enough to make up for the lost damage of the fury talents, and (importantly) can it deal with the lost threat reduction from imp Zerker Stance?<br>
<br>
The way I see it, compared to a 17/44 build, you lose: Rampage, 5/5 Imp Zerker Stance, and then 3 extra talent points (that will vary from person to person - for me my last 3 points are 2 precision, 1 commanding presence).<br>
<br>
You gain: 5/5 Sword Specialization, Death Wish, and essentially 3 worthless talent points (unless you somehow manage to work in overpower weaving).<br>
<br>
Well, already it doesn't look that promising, but I think it bears investigating. In some simple algebra (what seems to be referred to as 'napkin maths' around here these days) yesterday, I seemed to find that 5/5 sword spec is considerably better DPS from your auto-attacks than improved zerker stance, <b>assuming</b> that you use a fast offhand. Since offhand sword procs cause a mh attack, you want a really slow MH and a realy fast OH (so luckily, Warglaives should be *ideal* for this). This will lower your WW damage, but not by that much. I am still to calculate how IBS and SS affect specials, but I'm fairly certain (due to bloodthirst) that IBS will come out ahead, but overall I would bet on sword spec being a greater overall damage boost.<br>
<br>
That's all well and good, but it still leaves Death Wish squaring off against Rampage (an excellent talent no matter what some might say) and 3 other talent points.<br>
<br>
Of course, comparing all this is going to take a much more detailed investigation, one which I unfortunately don't have time for right now. My gut instinct is that 17/44 is going to come out ahead, but probably not by much, and on fights with a lot of movement, or very short fights (where average DW uptime is higher), 26/35 could take the lead.<br>
<br>
Has anyone else done any research or practice with this recently, or perhaps even tried it? I have a few swords available to me (<a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080226161752/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=30082"><span  ><span class="purplename">[Talon of Azshara]</span></span></a>, <a rel="nofollow" class="forumitemlink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080226161752/http://elitistjerks.com/./itemstats/updateitem.php?item=Akil%2527zons%2BTalonblade"><span  ><span class="greyname">[Akil'zons Talonblade]</span></span></a> and <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080226161752/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=33388"><span  ><span class="purplename">[Heartless]</span></span></a>), so I might give it a run sometime and see how it plays.

<br>
And do you keep executing or go back to your normal slam rotation after reck and dw are down?<br>

And, wouldn't 4/5 2h spec + 5/5 sword spec give you a bit more dmg just from the rage that you get from the one percent extra attacks?</div>

		<div id="post_message_651538">I ran with sword spec fury up until the beginning of T6 content.  At that point the AP value of imp zerk and rampage combined just becomes too powerful to pass up.   We are looking at upwards of 500 buffed attack power lost.   Its still a very fun spec, and the burst possibilities of DW with blood lust and sword procs is pretty intense.  I think its actaully probably a dps increase around the t5 level still, but once you get past that I can't see it being more then a fun toy.<br>
<br>
<br>
Also, remember that you're trading burst dps for lack of agro management for over all increased threat.  So, although most of us don't have threat issues anymore, its something to be aware of when considering the spec.</div>

</div>That would definatly just end up as lower dps then just BTing everytime the CD is up. I don't think rage would be an issue with Swordspec + WF either.<br>

</div>Could you explain that one? I don't fully understand how you could have a lack of rage as DW with windfury, not to mention UBW &amp; Swordspec.<br>
<br>
26/35 Might be a nice spec, I think in the end though it will fall short of 17/44 on most fight except the ones where short CD's have a big impact on the fight (Akama &amp; Gorefiend).<br>
<br>
It would be intresting to see how 27/44 would work in WoTLK though, unless they give us some sort of sick 51 pointer that pretty much makes Swordspec obsolete.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Charsi, what weapons do you use during execute range?<br>
<br>
And do you keep executing or go back to your normal slam rotation after reck and dw are down?<br>
<br>
And, wouldn't 4/5 2h spec + 5/5 sword spec give you a bit more dmg just from the rage that you get from the one percent extra attacks?</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</div>I continue using Cataclysm's Edge.  With enough haste effects the weapon speed comes down to a pretty silly level.  I have tried double Swiftsteel and it just strikes me as inconvenient (enchants, the gcd lost when you swap them in, etc).  Once Reck and DW fade, I usually keep executing, Heroism is more the controller for that since haste effects ruin a good Slam rotation.  I basically execute my way to the end of the fight, although ideally I probably should not be.<br>
<br>
As for 4/5 2h spec + 5/5 sword spec, I hadn't sat down and run any numbers on it tbh.  My thoughts were that a constant +1% damage would be better, as the missing point out of  sword specialization hasn't been something I really "felt" in any detrimental way.  (That is of course subjective and anecdotal.)  When you look at WWS parses like Gorefiend I get less than 10 sword specialization procs per fight - is an additional 1% chance going to give me even one extra proc over a fight of that length?  If not, what am I getting for my talent point spent.. an extra proc or two over the course of a night?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Regarding 26/35.. what are the extra 4 points above and beyond Bloodthirst in Fury getting you, are they that important, and can they be better spent in Arms, eg Improved Disciplines for longer Recklessness that might tip the favour towards this spec in shorter parses?</div>

Sorry for asking but I can't make the search work for my advantage. I've put out some competitive numbers, mostly cause my gear is near the top arms gear around, but I was wondering if I should be slamming after every white hit or not. And what to do if/when I'm not slamming. Also worthy of note is I have relatively high ping to server, being in the southern hemisphere, so is there a different spec I could use that still had blood frenzy but skipped slam and had comparable performance?</div>

</div>I started doing some modelling of sword spec vs IBS last night, and the results I found were that IBS is going to be better (damage-wise, even ignoring the threat reduction) than sword spec at *almost* all sensible gear load outs.<br>
<br>
For Sword Spec to come out ahead, you want a) A pair of Warglaives, b) quite a bit of +hit, and c) to spam hamstring in between BT and WW.<br>
<br>
However, under those circumstances, my simple modelling showed that Sword Spec would come out ahead, and this is before including the benefit of more procs (windfury, executioner, DST etc.) from having sword spec, and also ignoring the rage bonus - since all the bonus damage from sword spec gives rage, whereas a lot of the bonus damage from IBS is on yellow damage and so wont.<br>
<br>
I know a few people have mentioned using spamstring to increase flurry rate and other procs, I think with Sword Spec it is a viable way to go, and means that even with worse weapons, sword spec will still be competitive with IBS.<br>
<br>
The question now is how effective is Death wish? I guess I should try to play around with Grim's spreadsheet, I think just averaging it's affect by uptime is going to be really underselling it - when you time it with recklessness and bloodlust it will be a big boost.<br>
<br>
I'm thinking of trying out 26/35 tomorrow in Hyjal/BT since I'll have to respec from PvP anyway, I'll let you know how it goes.<br>
<br>
For those wondering, this is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080226161752/http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=LA0IzhboxZVxzmxxRVzo" target="_blank">the build that I would use</a> (Woot, Stun Resist for Kaz'rogal!)<br>
<br>
<b>Update!</b><br>
<br>
I added Windfury totem into the calculations and everything has changed! Sword Spec is now *better* than Improved Zerker stance in pretty much _all_ sensible gear loadouts (but using a fast offhand). In a setup tailored to Sword Spec (Warglaives, decent amount of +hit) it does more than 30dps more the with IBS.<br>
<br>
Once again I'm intrigued, and really looking forward to trying this out. Also I really want Warglaives more than ever :-/</div>

</div>Possibly, that's what I'm wondering.<br>
<br>
I had my 2nd night as 26/35 last night, killing Illidari Council and then spending the rest of the night learning Illidan. Since phase 1 is mostly just tank and spank, it seemed a fairly good test of the spec, and I have to say I was dissappointed. It had been quite good on the council, where not having to keep up rampage was a blessing, but when just standing there and nuking, it seemed to fall quite behind. I don't have a WWS but looking at recount after each try I was lagging sorely behind our other melee and hunters. Some of this could be due to my unfamiliarity with the spec, but at present I don't think it's going to be good enough to be competitive with 17/44 <i>with my current gear</i>.<br>
<br>
For now, I think I'm going to go back to 17/44, but I'm going to do some more theorycrafting, in particularly on how hit (and to a lesser extent haste) affect the 2 builds, and then maybe come back to it later if I find a 'more optimal' gear loadout for the spec.<br>
<br>
So for now, my summary on 26/35 is - good spec, fun if you want something different, but currently not really competitive with 17/44.</div>

Considering the amount of armor penetration items currently in game and soon-to-be in game from Sunwell, Warriors can easily get past the armor penetration "cap," the amount of armor penetration you should stay under in order to get the maximum benefit from executioner. In other words, whenever executioner is up, a certain amount of your static armor penetration is being wasted. Therefore, would it be better to switch over to mongoose for for a weapon enchants for both 2h and DW weapons?</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Possibly, that's what I'm wondering.<br>
<br>
I had my 2nd night as 26/35 last night, killing Illidari Council and then spending the rest of the night learning Illidan. Since phase 1 is mostly just tank and spank, it seemed a fairly good test of the spec, and I have to say I was dissappointed. It had been quite good on the council, where not having to keep up rampage was a blessing, but when just standing there and nuking, it seemed to fall quite behind. I don't have a WWS but looking at recount after each try I was lagging sorely behind our other melee and hunters. Some of this could be due to my unfamiliarity with the spec, but at present I don't think it's going to be good enough to be competitive with 17/44 <i>with my current gear</i>.<br>
<br>
For now, I think I'm going to go back to 17/44, but I'm going to do some more theorycrafting, in particularly on how hit (and to a lesser extent haste) affect the 2 builds, and then maybe come back to it later if I find a 'more optimal' gear loadout for the spec.<br>
<br>
So for now, my summary on 26/35 is - good spec, fun if you want something different, but currently not really competitive with 17/44.</div>

</div>Ive been testing it so far in Hyjal with pretty good success. I've been top in the top 5 as high as 2 with this spec for the fights I manage to stay alive for. :P Your aggro is higher, but not enough to make it insanely hard to DPS well. Just make sure you have salv. I'll link a WWS once we're done.</div>

		<div id="post_message_656387">Greetings everyone,<br>
Im having some fun with the fury war in raids nowadays but i still got some questions. I´ve seen lots of experienced warriors in this thread and doing wonders in the WWSs, and maybe i could get some help around here. My question is about gems/stats of a fury war, particularly when it comes to choose between str/crit gems. According to maxdps.com, +8 str = 4,38 dps and +8 crit = 2,69 dps. When it comes to socketing, there is a rule to ALWAYS choose the +8 str gem? Or is there a point where the +8 crit will have a better dps feedback (mainly because of flurry)? Is there a priority list like: gear with hit until 10%, then gear/socket with crit until 30% and then stack str? Thanks in advance.</div>

</div>Sorry, I should have clarified, its a 2h fury build with sword spec. Hence the imp cleave and slam, slam might have been a mistake, I thought I would use it as a rage dump but after a bit of playing around it seems pointless to use instead of heroic/cleave. This is just my personal opinion, but with this build and the new Sunwell haste/armor pen gear 2h fury just might make a huge comeback from BWL days. Haste really makes my setup shine a lot, hopefully I can get my hands on a DST soon, should be a huge boost.</div>

</div>In my post above I noted that taking IMP slam might have been a mistake, I've only used it a few times and it seemed like a waste to use it. Cleave for trash or heroic strike on bosses with hamstring was much better dps for me, we dont force specs so sometimes its either me or another dps warrior that has BF, sometimes we dont. But as far as personal dps goes for me this build seemed better than 33/28 or 17/44 and also a lot easier to play. If I happen to get lucky and pick up a DST I will most likely have to go respec and put the 2 pts from imp slam somewhere else.</div>

Personally I wouldn't use an execute/Bloodthirst macro (if there even is one (not that I use the one I just pasted)). I know it's advocated to use BT over execute if you have 30 rage, but with a lot of good stuff going sub 20%, chances are good you'll have a lot more than 30 rage to spend every 1.5 second. In my experience I'm better off mindlessly spamming execute. Of course, that's where a macro as you mentioned would be handy.</div>

Quick easy question for you guys.<br>
<br>
We have a few Furry warriors which we raid Kara with, and they seem to be doing below average on DPS.  The have PvP gear but mostly S3 and have S1 weapons, with some other random Purples.  Neither of these players really go out on the web and search for ways to up DPS, they are pretty casual in their play style.  As a lock, I know what my spell rotation when I raid affliction as well as Destro.  Is there a good beginner raid rotation for a Warrior that would help these guys out.  <br>

</div>Maybe it has something to do with wrong positioning, group build or even gemming. Every aspects adds a little increase if done right. If their only job is DPS they should be doing &gt;700 at least I guess. <br>
They can push their stats with the right enchants on weapons and gear. I'd say buffs make up to 35% of their dmg (speculation). ~15% is only applying 5x sunders on a boss/mob  and having cor or ff up (my raid does't use cor). So then you have shamans that will up their dmg for at least another 10% (totems, bloodlust, etc. ) and so on.<br>
<br>
As a hint, you can take a look at the various wws reports. Just pick a fury warrior and click to the buff column. Their you will see a list of used/gained buffs during the fight. You might see drums, windfury, elixiers or weapon procs. Just compare that to your warrior setup. Warriors scale excellent with support mechanisms (as do those nice little rogues).<br>
<br>
Besides support, picking the right weapon choices can come down to quite some different DPS behaviour. S1 is ok for kara but they should consider arena upgrades (easiest to get, true but sad).</div>

I was asked early this week by the GM that I go Blood Frenzy MS, proverbial music to my ears as it were; so I have done so and I feel that with my current spec I have implemented my points nicely, by all means if I need to change some things please let me know. What I am getting at here is after numerous attempts at a steady swing rotation I feel that given enough rage there is one that works particularly good and I have yet to deviate from it, but not doing so I feel I am not opening my doors to other things that may be set in the rotation. This is where I ask your assistance, it is sometimes a bit hard to get some detailed information from other warriors so I am posting this here.<br>
<br>
     Currently my swings go in order of {White Damage___Slam___MS(<i>if given enough rage to complete the slam WITH </i><i>the mortal strike, so 45 I believe</i>)___WW.} I constantly keep Battle Shout up and feel that a possible cleave and or an Heroic Strike might be added to boost DPS. I would greatly appreciate it if you provide me with some specs of your own, and or an helpful spread sheet relating to my spec / situation.  Please forgive me but after a bit of searching through several pages I did not find anything specifically related to my question, so if it is full of raid swing rotations for BF warriors I am sorry. Thank you all for the input.</div>

</div>I'm not sure how you missed it, but it's white, slam, instant, white, slam, instant.  MS &gt; WW.  Keep shouts up, HS to rage dump but don't rage-starve yourself.<br>
<br>
The "helpful spreadsheet" that you are looking for is the warrior DPS spreadsheet, which is very easy to find here.</div>

		<div id="post_message_660367">Hey all,<br>
<br>
I tried reading through most of these pages to find my answers, but 128 pages worth was getting to me.  I have a few questions that I thought could be answered here.  I am normally a Protection warrior, but have the chance to go fury and I was unsure about a few things.<br>
<br>
Firstly is enchants, right now I use Executioner on my MH and Potency on my OH.  I have 2 2.6 speed weapons.  I have seen warriors do a number of things with weapon enchants, is mongoose better for my OH? <br>
<br>
Another is boots, I have yet to enchant them because I am stuck in between Surefooted and 12 Agil.  <br>
<br>
Does Piercing Howl actually count as a daze and increase HS dmg?<br>
<br>
The last question is damage rotation, how can I maximize my dmg?  Where should I be on the dmg meter in BT?<br>
<br>
Thanks in advance.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Ive been testing it so far in Hyjal with pretty good success. I've been top in the top 5 as high as 2 with this spec for the fights I manage to stay alive for. :P Your aggro is higher, but not enough to make it insanely hard to DPS well. Just make sure you have salv. I'll link a WWS once we're done.</div>

</div>So, get any WWS to take a look?<br>
<br>
I've tried spec today and I like it. But I was able to dps only on Archimonde which is not the best boss to measure: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304022228/http://wowwebstats.com/hpdg43ardqw6y?s=7900-8275" target="_blank">Wow Web Stats</a></div>
