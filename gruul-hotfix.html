Gruul no longer uses Hurtful Strike, and Shatter damage has been reduced substantially. As an added bonus, Hydross is now incapable of crushing. No changes to Magtheridon yet. /cheer<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

However in the last 3 weeks we have had 1 hour ( 1 cleared trash) of not potted attempts, and then potted up after the next reclear, he has bugged on our first potted attempt every time Our second kill he shattered twice then bugged, 3rd and 4th he didn't do anything. <br>

I accept that at 2 minutes in and the bug was apparent we didn't deliberately stand in cave in to wipe but no one could justify wasting the guilds money and time.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

A week ago, it was consumables this, and too hard entry into 25-man raiding that. They nerf Gruul so he actually becomes the stepping stone into 25-man raiding he is supposed be, and the virtual sky is falling. Can anyone please tell me what's so bad about more people entering Serpentshrine? Will the massively overpowered loot in there shift pvp balances into unbalanced proportions? *snort*.<br>

My guild got their well-deserved "hardmode" Gruul kill a week ago, so so we can stick that feather up our ass.

		<div id="post_message_308116"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->To be blunt - nerfing him into the ground (if it generates any excitement for 25 man raiding) was the right choice on so many levels that it's not really debatable in my mind.<br>
<br>
Having 4 million people excited and participating in the raid game is far far more valuable to me than having the raid game be some meaninglessly "difficult" challenge for less than 400 people.<br>
<br>
If you really want to do something impressive, go collect some GM Norms.  Wow shouldn't be your only source of personal pride to the extent that you feel threatened when anyone approaches your achievements.<br>
<br>
I'm super happy for the raiding game overall, because I like raiding.  Personally?  I like the hardcore "face in blender" type stuff, so on a personal level gruul was fine.  As a raid leader/guild leader he was completely unacceptable.  For my "fun" type of stuff to be in game as a niche object requires that the supporting masses have something to do.<br>

		<div id="post_message_308126"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I fully agree with this. Why do people (especially those who knew the nerf bat was coming) get bent out of shape that now maybe 20% of a server can kill the guy? For me, the only two valid reasons to complain about a raid being too easy are a) if you have exhausted all raid content or b) if that gives too easy access to amazing gear. Nobody has even come close to seeing all raid content, and we all know that the current loot does not really deliver.<br>
<br>
So, why complain? There are enough overtuned, consumable-draining encouters left in the game. Leave something for the rest of us please. Now maybe those who dislike farming can now actually participate in raiding. That hurts anyone how exactly?<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">To be blunt - nerfing him into the ground (if it generates any excitement for 25 man raiding) was the right choice on so many levels that it's not really debatable in my mind.<br>
<br>
Having 4 million people excited and participating in the raid game is far far more valuable to me than having the raid game be some meaninglessly "difficult" challenge for less than 400 people.<br>
<br>
If you really want to do something impressive, go collect some GM Norms.  Wow shouldn't be your only source of personal pride to the extent that you feel threatened when anyone approaches your achievements.<br>
<br>
I'm super happy for the raiding game overall, because I like raiding.  Personally?  I like the hardcore "face in blender" type stuff, so on a personal level gruul was fine.  As a raid leader/guild leader he was completely unacceptable.  For my "fun" type of stuff to be in game as a niche object requires that the supporting masses have something to do.<br>

</div>That's beside the point.<br>
<br>
The point is that there will be little challenge to anyone, not just the hardcore guilds, with this change to gruul. This makes him easy to the majority of raiding guilds. That is the point.<br>
<br>
I think the the challenge should be equal to the numbers; if most guilds are stuck on or around Gruul he should be a challenge to them. This was not the case before, and wont be the case now. He goes from being too hard to be too easy, and thus the point is shifted forwards, to Hydross.<br>
<br>
Whom, we shall assume, will be too hard. Your response would be to nerf him to the new Gruul level.<br>
<br>
But this is a slipperly slope that leards to a raiding game not worthy of the name.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I personaly think they tune the places harder to begin with to give the hardcores something to challenge themselves, as well as slow progression, then nerf it once it seems there are enough people hitting the wall at it.<br>

	</tr>
	</table>
</div>I don't think it's sound at all really. Ideally they should tune it to the appropriate difficulty and leave it.<br>
<br>
The problem that arises with your method is that most guilds will get complacent and just wait for the inevitable nerf. There are a lot of raiders who aren't Nihilum hardcore who still want a good challenge without insane consumable needs. Those people would get screwed when the rest of the guild decides to wait for the loot piñata they know is coming.<br>
<br>
Gruul was overtuned at the end of beta because he was beaten relatively quickly by a DnT-led PuG. Serpentshrine is just now getting it's public beta testing thanks to the guilds that pushed through Gruul and it should be appropriately tuned (not nerfed) by the time the bulk of the raiding guilds hit it.<br>
<br>
But you're right in that the Blizzard philosophy is to tune high and be very cautious in retuning. Look how long it took them to adjust C'thun. These sudden hotfixes before the 2.1.0 patch (contrary to Tigole's statement that he wanted Gruul changes on the PTR first) seem to speak more of political pressures within Blizzard than anything.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Its there... its annoying but its rarely going to wipe you.<br>

Given the task of him being an entry level encounter, I believe we have all let our thoughts become scattered on what we believed Gruul to be.

Im expecting early SSL &amp; TK to be 'hit by the nerf bat' and the zones will become AQ'esk with a pretty easy start, a ramp up half way and then a gritty final boss.<br>
Hyjal &amp; BT will then become our 'Naxx' of TBC.<br>
<br>
Given the current level of of Gruul, do people find him to be on-par with Kara/Maulger? is he really ment to be considerd an 'uber end boss' like C'Thun or Nef? or is it simply a 2 boss zone of relative difficulty.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">That's beside the point.<br>
<br>
The point is that there will be little challenge to anyone, not just the hardcore guilds, with this change to gruul. This makes him easy to the majority of raiding guilds. That is the point.<br>
<br>
I think the the challenge should be equal to the numbers; if most guilds are stuck on or around Gruul he should be a challenge to them. This was not the case before, and wont be the case now. He goes from being too hard to be too easy, and thus the point is shifted forwards, to Hydross.<br>
<br>
Whom, we shall assume, will be too hard. Your response would be to nerf him to the new Gruul level.<br>
<br>
But this is a slipperly slope that leards to a raiding game not worthy of the name.</div>

</div>I didn't even think about that, but you may be right.  Sounds like it could be something like "fine, if you're gonna keep complaining, we're just going to nerf it to the point where absolutely no one will complain about it being too hard again" and kind of overdoing it out of spite or something.  Kind if interesting if that would actually be the case, and of course there's no way for us to ever know but it could have some interesting implications further down the line.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

No one liked going to Gruul though much and the last time we went over there was the first time I can honestly say that we felt like we were really getting progress.

</div>I would assume the second of the two, although with Gruul/Mag where AQ40 was, and shift everything appropriately. Currently pre-nerf Gruul/Mag are where they are in the first diagram, yet SSC is not (both morogrim and karathress were kinda easy imo, although Hydross is still on the level of Gruul. Someone seems to have screwed up exactly what they want from encounters). MC and BWL were learning experiences for Blizzard as much as for us tbh, and they found the encounter design where it should have been near the end of AQ (c'thun especially - I don't know of anyone who doesn't like that fight), although the beginning of AQ was hardly bad design, merely not tuned quite far enough maybe. <br>
<br>
It should be a continuation of good design with some space for an early learning curve, not just dumping anyone who has picked up WoW when BC comes out finding themselves with a brick wall in their face when they try and raid, which is how it is pre-nerf. Post-nerf I believe it's probably the same, as Gruul sounds like he's been nerfed so far that Hydross will be the wall now (as has already been said in this thread). <br>
<br>
Nerfing Gruul was needed - as much of a nerf as people seem to be saying has happened was almost certainly not.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

There is nothing in Gruul now that is going to be that challenging for those guilds who wern't in Naxx, let alone those that were.<br>

They could have lowered his HP by less and decreased the shatter by less and still have him be unchallenging for those who were in Naxx, but challening, and doable, for those that wern't. <br>

<br>
I personally feel the changes are pretty good aside from the whole fact that he's not using hurtful strike. Fix that, and I think it will be in line with where it should be. <br>
<br>
I'm hearing of people who say they can't go over 4k dmg on a shatter even when standing on top of someone, but I still managed to stand right on top of someone to test it and got hit for the usual 9k whenever you stack on top of someone. It seems pretty clear that the formula for shatter damage has changed to me.<br>
<br>
As far as his HP goes, my SW meter shows him taking 4.5 mil for the duration of the fight. I'm not sure what he had before, but wasn't it around that much?<br>
<br>
I suppose our Gruul could have been screwed up and not had the fixes, although it seemed like we could live through the shatter much easier than we did before. It also could have been that everyone was playing better since they thought he had been changed and were excited for a kill. Or yeah, maybe he really was different. I'm wondering if that 4k for standing right on top of someone is an exaggeration or if we just had a different Gruul because I most definitely did take 9k stacked right on top of someone.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I've not seen any indication that the population of active posters on this board are in any way representative of the average spread of guilds in WoW. This is the entry level 25-person raid in The Burning Crusade, not something that a collection of generally advanced players in relatively "hardcore" guilds should need to theorize over for two months on a forum and still have only a few guilds per server kill. Gruul today is intended feel like Onyxia over a year ago: the easily accessible raid boss that even the most casual of raiding guilds can kill. A boss of the intended caliber has no business being as difficult and begging of theorycrafting posts as Naxxramas bosses (the former mysteries of Ony phase 3 aggro aside <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080407224545im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/biggrin.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":D" class="inlineimg">).

He drops Prince level loot. He should never have been harder. Just let him die, this was a needed and necessary nerf to a poorly designed and implimented fight. <br>
<br>
Yeah, it would have been nice if he'd just been properly tuned and interesting from the start, but he wasn't. Still, an overnerf is vastly better than the alternative many were expecting, ie nothing for a month.

Slighly OT, but its getting really quite old that they have to rebalance every encounter 2 months after the fact, as if it is difficult at all for a coroprate entity the size of Blizzard to be able to put together a Raid QA team, and all they do is QA the encounters to ensure that they are at the proper level where they need to be vice nerfing everything and turning once hard encounters into trivial gestures.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">It's been stated before but it bears repeating, the original version of Ony was damn hard.  I had a guild at the time that was extremely experienced at raiding from EQ, was extremely focused and dedicated and was also most capable of dissecting encounters and dealing with whatever devs might throw at us.  Ony was still painful.<br>
<br>
<i>Six months after release</i> Ony was not.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</div>I think the difference is that the top raiders know pretty much everything there is to know about wow, they know how aggro works, they run mods for that, they know all the different timer systems, and have mods for that.<br>
<br>
Not only that, but they know how Blizz operate to a certain extent, and test them much much quicker, they've done the c'thun fight and know about spreading out, about range-based dmg, they knew what growths were very quickly and how to counter-act that.<br>
<br>
Probably most importantly, they know how to play their class perfectly and know how to make gear choices, when Ony was first being killed people were in some odd gear choices, and some very odd spec choices, the numbers by and large hadn't been run on what spec was the best for every situation.<br>
<br>
And yet, with all this experience, knowledge and tuning of a raid, they STILL find it incredibly hard. Why should a guild that has been built up since the BC launch not be able to complete the second boss in 25 man raids? Yes there needs to be a challenge for the hard-core raiders that are the same group since MC and work perfectly for it, but the 2nd 25 man boss is not the one that should be challenging these people.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

As you can see, I had 366700 damage, for 7.5% of raid DPS. That puts total damage at around 4.9million. Assuming 10k damage per person from shatter (very possible for a kill with Gruul in this state), that's still 4.65mil, or roughly what he was before.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

He drops Prince level loot. He should never have been harder. Just let him die, this was a needed and necessary nerf to a poorly designed and implimented fight. <br>
<br>
Yeah, it would have been nice if he'd just been properly tuned and interesting from the start, but he wasn't. Still, an overnerf is vastly better than the alternative many were expecting, ie nothing for a month. Kudos to them for keeping many more raiders interested in the game.</div>

</div>I think they were fairly obvious changes. There was a lot of ways to make the encounter more in line with the loot he drops. Shatter seems a bit excessive, honestly at this point, you don't need a strat really for positioning. Find 2 people to stand on and no one can possibly die, and no one could possibly be near each other in that setup. The HP nerf was non existant. Either way, the changes were what pretty much every other post was asking for.<br>

It was sort of odd fighting him with 0 hurtful strikes, not that hurtful was ever a substantial issue.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
My guild isn't the most progressed or largest guild on our server, but probably within the top-5.  That said, we spent one night (about 5 hours in total) on Gruul prior to this fix, learning the encounter.  I think our best run ever was 40% or so at maybe 12ish grows, mostly unpotted save flasks on the MT/OT and a few caster DPS.<br>
<br>
After our night of attempts some weeks ago and hearing changes were incoming, I decided our time was better spent on Karazhan, Maulgar, and learning Magtheridon instead of Gruul.  So, we did exactly that, and ignored him.<br>
<br>
Tonight after our two Karazhan raids finished clearing, we went back to Gruul's lair for Maulgar and to "see what the changes" were like on Gruul.  We managed to wipe 3 times before downing Maulgar, and proceeded to literally one-shot Gruul on the first pull without consumables.  That said, he only shattered us twice the entire fight, and hit 14 grows, so I'm fairly certain he 'bugged out' as I've heard is common.<br>
<br>
Now, it wasn't a flawless kill by any means.  We had 2 cloth DPS die to the first shatter for whatever reason, then a rogue died about halfway through to cave in damage.  Further, once Gruul hit 12+ Grows, people started dropping fairly rapidly to cave-in damage.  He died with around a dozen people alive.<br>
<br>
I, as the MT, wasn't flasked -- I had 30 STA food and 15 STA drink, plus the usual buffs (fort, motw, kings, cs, blood pact) and was sitting around 18.8k HP and 13.5k AC with 517 defense.  As the fight was getting deep (11-12 Grows), I noticed his damage on me seemed, as I recall, much <i>higher</i> than normal.  Granted, I could've just not been paying as close attention to our previous attempts before this hotfix, but I know for certain he quickly climbed to 7k+ normal hits on me and even after I called for Lay on Hands and was sitting at well over 18k AC, for the final 15% of the fight he was never hitting me for less than 9.5k non-crushing.  He never went above 14 Grows, so please correct me if I'm wrong or recalling incorrectly, but I do not recall his damage on the MT ever being that high prior to this hotfix.<br>
<br>
Also seeing that Magtheridon's single-target damage has gone up, it makes me wonder if they increased Gruul's as well in an attempt to give healers more to do now that Shatter damage has dropped.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I'm a little surprised at the ease of our first try, but I expect he'll still be capable of wiping raids off and on that haven't had him on farm for a while now/never fought him.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Yea, I agree with you, but it may have been the wrong way to handle it. I expect in a few days after some more guilds get a full raid keyed for SSC, we'll see lots of posts about the difficulty of Hydross and the general dumbness of the trash in that instance. He should be easier than he was, but not easier than Maulgaur.</div>

	</tr>
	</table>
</div>I was already seeing posts on these forums about general dumbness of trash in SSC on these forums long before this nerf. The complaints were coming from people who generally know a lot about topics before they chime in on them, too. <br>
<br>
All in all, I'm very happy with the tuning. While the guild I'm in is nowhere near the level of most guilds on these forums, we were the only horde guild on Aggramar with a Maexxna kill pre-TBC. Looking at Gruul from a less jaded perspective than many of the hardcore players on these forums, I'd place Gruul at about the difficulty level of Razuvious and Anub'rhekan back when we were learning the few bosses in Naxx that we killed. Considering that there were only three horde guilds on my server to kill anything in Naxx, I'd say that Gruul's current difficulty appears to be a good starting point. I'd be very disappointed if all raid bosses stayed at this level, but it's a great start.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

People can still die to cave in if you get any significant amount of grows, but its as easy to deal with now as it was before. You did get a bugged kill btw with 1 shatter, so I guess that still exists, and it will still make your fight time a lot shorter. I think we had 6 or 7 tonight, I forget, which from repositioning everyone, bandaging etc, you lose a good minute of constant dps just due to shatters.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_308274"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->It is difficult to take a fight like Gruul and change him in any way that doesn't literally nerf him in a direct and overbearing manner.  Its not an execution fight so much.  <br>
<br>
Did they go too far?  Well, who knows, we got him yesterday so we didn't get to experience it, but perhaps.  Still, he should be just harder than Maulgar right?<br>
<br>
It takes something away from those beyond him, and something away from those who haven't defeated him yet to nerf him - the devs obviously know this, and change like this aren't gonna be done fool-heartedly; but overall the content wasn't tuned for everyone out there, as the second encounter should be.  I would seriously expect more nerfs down the line to SSC, until there is a true progression that all guilds can fit themselves into.  There are certainly always challenges and undefeated content out there for everyone reading this.  <br>
<br>
The best solution would've been to have a lower difficulty 25 man raid... but since that doesn't exist you have to match the current content to the players.  <br>
<br>
To those who are just killing Gruul for the first time tonight, and moving into SSC: the encounters in SSC are just as hard as the old Gruul if you want that challenge, and yet - they are far more controllable, and far more fun.  Tidewalker and Hydross are just a blast.  You've moved into better things.  At least the poor design of Gruul will likely never be seen again in World of Warcraft (we can only hope).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_308279"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Guys, guys...  Before you complain about how Gruul has become too easy, realize what is meant by "average."<br>
<br>
The "average" raiding guild is, as of this moment, stuck on Moroes.  Yes, Moroes.  And this is not even representative of the average player.  The average player is still doing Mana Tombs.<br>
<br>
If the "average" guild can now one-shot Gruul the first time they ever attempt him, then yes - there might be a problem.  But just because a couple of guilds that's killed Gruul BEFORE the nerf and/or gotten him down to &lt;10%, can now kill him with ease, does not mean the fight is too easy.  <br>
<br>
At any case, all this nerf really does is move the deadlock a tad higher.  Instead of Gruul, it's now Magtheridon.  When he, too, is nerfed - it'll be Hydross, or just SSC trash in general.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I do however feel sad that it seems that Maulgar is harder than Gruul, which really shouldn't be the case of this instance imo. It's not really easy to kill Maulgar without a mage with 12 000 HP or so, but being able to do Gruul with a max HP of around 6 500 or so on some is just not as fun.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

As it stands, I fully agree with these changes.  "Average Joe" guild will still need to pot/flask fairly heavily in order to get him within any decent amount of time.  And as a couple people have mentioned earlier in this thread, "Average Joe" guild does not flask for bosses.  I can still see people struggling to learn the mechanics of shatter, spreading out and trying to use whatever safe spots are still left, much less having a tank that can live through a lovely 14-growth cave-in + reverb combination.<br>

		<div id="post_message_308296"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->For me, this is great news. Our guild had a recent breakup and we're low on the "hardcore" style players as they left to greener pastures.<br>
<br>
We're still working our way trough karazhan, up to about illhoof or so.<br>
<br>
This change should mean that we at least stand a fighting chance on Gruul in a few weeks time when we're back at the playercount we want and have geared up a bit more from further kara encounters.<br>
<br>
Do keep in mind, as the above poster states and others in this thread, this forum has a very, very poor representation of the vast playerbase in the game.<br>
<br>
There are guilds doing far better then us at the moment, but we're far from bad. We've got good players and I'm pretty sure I can safly assume that our situation is similiar to a lot of smaller raiding-but-not-hardcore guilds out there.<br>
<br>
Pre-tbc we had some ventures into naxx (2-3 bosses) and where up to c'thun.<br>
<br>
Basically, this change seems on paper like the right thing to do.<br>
<br>
Gruul is not supposed to be the ultimate challenge like Naxx, it's supposed to be a "properly tuned" ony.<br>
<br>
You'll find your proper endgame in Hyjal or maybe even BK. The highest tiers of dungeons is the domain of the really dedicated and buffed up players. It's a two way street really. We know we cant go in an farm the endgame (and I mean truely endgame) places any time soon. Thats our sacrifice. You, as in the most hardcore and skilled, do get to experience these amazing encounters and get the gear. The price you pay for that is having lower tiered dungeouns that feels like a complete joke to you.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">For me what is of real interest is the fact that after much song and dance about consumables and tuning, they pushed these changes out before 2.1 even hit PTR. We could speculate for a long time on why, but I feel this is something of significance, posibbly greater importance than the exact changes to Gruul which we all knew were inevitable.</div>

</div>Gurgthock's slapped me down once or twice for making crass comments about releasing Black Temple in 2.1 - it'll be released then because it's ready (or ready enough).  It's quite possible the same applies here - they did internal testing and realised that the changes they've made didn't need to go through the PTR and could be hotfixed.<br>
<br>
Going back to speaking more generally - perhaps they realised it doesn't matter if Gruul ends up undertuned?   It's the entry level dungeon, it doesn't necessarily *need* to be tuned to that knife edge of "takes weeks of practice".  There's a *lot* of content out there ahead of it, in a way there just wasn't with Onyxia at release.<br>
<br>
Another possible reason for delaying the fix till 2.1 would be to balance it against the upcoming consumable changes.  Presumably they made a decision that it doesn't matter if a few guilds brute-force it with consumables over the next few weeks.<br>
<br>
What will be interesting (from the outside perspective for me, until we recruit more tanks and push on into 25-man!) will be whether/how they rebalance SSC fights, TK fights etc. when the consumable changes (whatever they are) go live.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

To be honest, I think it's a way into 25 man raiding for guilds who are trying to clear Karazhan still.  And that's the way it should have been in the first place really, from running nightly 40 man raids to maybe getting 2-3 karazhan raids with raid ID's confused people locked left right and center it was/is driving allot of guilds into the dirt, I see this is as a way to semi-revive our raid schedule and a way to please the semi-hardcore in the guild without farking up Raid ID's.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Even as it is you can still lose (lol this fight is so easy, oops, 8 people not bothering to move when they're right next to the MT after a shatter...haha!) if you don't execute properly and if your dps is horrible you're still going to be looking at 10k non-crushings near the end of the fight.<br>

</div>Just had to respond to this... I really don't think the difference is as great as one might hope. By my numbers, going from a block value of 400 to 1000 generally adds a little more than 100 TPS. This threat gain is really only worth it when you're off-tanking without taking damage.<br>

<br>
We went in for Gruul last night and called it after a few bugtastic attempts. Instead of like most bugged Gruul fights which are considerably easier (and we have had a few) he was if anything harder.<br>
<br>
We went in with a normal comp and melee was dying left and right, couldnt figure out why. Thought we were dying to an unannounced Cavein untill I caught it on my combat log, Gruul was Hurtful Striking random melee targets. To further test it, we went in on more attempts and I stood there, barely genning threat, just enough to be on his meter but well below our Misdirected OT and still ate hurtfuls.<br>
<br>
Now not everyone one of his hurtfuls is hitting the melee, most of them hit the OT but not all of them and I am now convinced it isnt a matter of threat. We first thought KTM was buggy and not showing threat correctly, but no reason it shouldnt be just on this fight, also the amount of threat the tanks are generating is on par with our normal kills of him at those %'s.<br>

</div>Interesting.  I'm the OT for that fight and have never really had problems with my threat until this week.  I thought something was wrong, maybe with my gear, or that I was getting parried a lot or something (what do you use to measure TPS?).  He was doing what you described; almost randomly going after other Melee with Hurtfuls.<br>
<br>
One attempt we were pulling, MT in front me right behind.  MT grabs him and is going to tank position.  I hit Demo Roar to just get on aggro.  A priest in the guild is running behind me to stay in range of the MT.  Gruul turns and one-shots the priest with a Hurtful even though I'm absolutely above him on threat and in melee range.  We thought it was the priest's fault because he was new.  Another attempt a Rogue came in the same way and got one-shot.  We had to tell people to just stand way back during the run in which usually isn't a problem.<br>
<br>
During the attempts themselves, I'd be pumping out threat as best I could, and I'd see Gruul's target change to one of the melee over and over again.  Most landed on me, but not all.  One of our Rogues died to a Hurtful, got battle rezzed, and a minute later got another Hurtful (I think he dodged that one).  Of course, this made his epeen enormous.<br>
<br>
I thought I was failing miserably as the OT (I went so far as to pot up with everything I had to try to keep threat going).  Finally we had an attempt where he wasn't going after the melee, and we downed him.  It was really odd.<br>

</div>I was standing closer to Gruul than the MT was.  A couple times, it was possible that I wasn't close enough, but not every single one of those.  The priest and Rogue that died were further back than I was on the run in; I was only a few steps behind the MT.  Graphical latency and all that, but still.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Same happened to us on our first 2 IDs (post nerf). I'm afraid I ain't got the Log anymore, but he had his old hp back. One day later (still same ID) he had his new amount of hp, but didnt shatter before 22%.<br>
<br>
Also we had some tries where he oneshotted the melees with Hurtfuls and I dont think its just an issue of the OT beeing too far away. I've read quite a lot about his tiny hitbox (I'm the Offtank) and was standing in the middle of his red circle all the time. Melee was told to not get near Gruul if I wasn't exactly between his legs - still some got oneshotted. (If KTM istn all wrong, they never had more than 75-80% of my aggro during the fight)<br>
<br>
Especially the switching of his hp makes me mad as hell as I spend hours of farming pots just to play some Rolling-Games with Gruul later wether he's beatable for us or not.<br>
<br>
<br>
By now we've wasted 3 IDs (maybe 10 hours) on this mob and I doubt more than 10% of our wipes were our fault. HS on the MT (with 2 Melees between Gruuls legs and MT shown on top of KTM) and funny stuff like 3 silences in 20 seconds dont really make this mob fun anymore. People are getting frustrated and start loosing their will to fight him any longer as he is now.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_339810"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Just an update on my whole Gruul running away after Shatter dilemma.  I figured out what the problem was with him.  My standard M.O. when ground slam goes off that myself and the OT both intercept into him and then try and put ourselves as far away from each other as we can while still being in melee range.  <br>
<br>
A few times this week, I didn't get punted very far, so rather than lose all that rage, I just walked up to him.  He stuck on me, and didn't cause any problems.  What occured to me is that the act of intercepting while having the slowing effect made Gruul think I was somewhere else.<br>
<br>
I have also started saving my bloodrage as well however, and I think I might continue to use intercept to get back to him after the ground slam.  It gives the healers time to get back into position, as he goes charging off (and now I'm not so sure he's actually going after specific people anymore) I hit bloodrage, and it's a good 2-3 seconds where he isn't hitting anyone.  <br>
<br>
I'm only concerned that he may hurtful strike someone as he runs past them.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

We did Gruul a few days ago and switched up our tanking to have a different MT. Our Hunter was not paying attention and misdirected to our usual MT. Usual MT gains initial agro, new MT pulls it off him and begins to tank like normal. Gruul was bugged and did no HS or ground slams. Like I said, it could have been a coincidence, but I recall someone mentioned before that they were doing some sort of tank switch at the beginning a lot and it was causing him to bug out. May I'm misremembering but this may be a reason why he bugs.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_340263"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Tuesday, we were at around 10ish growths, and I got destroyed by a reverb when all of my healers were moving simultaneously.  The next series of events led to our first bugged Gruul.<br>
<br>
1. HS tank becomes MT, top threat rogue pops evasion.<br>
2. Evasion fades, rogue dies, soulstones up.<br>
3. Next rogue evasions, it fades, rogue dies, soulstones up (We're not overly confident in our rogues survivability)<br>
4. After this point, no more specials occur.  No reverb, HS, Shatter, nothing.<br>
<br>
It is definitely possible that MT swapping could lead to Gruul bugging out, however we didn't see it until he had killed two melee after the MT swap.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

We were having trouble keeping our tank up on Gruul. Here's the relevant bits from the WWS combat log:<br>
<br>
7:40:21.XXX Gruul the Dragonkiller is afflicted by Thunderclap<br>
7:40:36.218 Gruul the Dragonkiller hits Tank for 7467 (block for xxx)<br>
7:40:38.687 Gruul the Dragonkiller hits Tank for 7898 (block for xxx)<br>
7:40:39.968 Gruul the Dragonkiller hits Tank for 8762 (tank dies)<br>
<br>
Gruul does NOT parry ANYONE during that time interval. Why was his final attack so much quicker?<br>
<br>
Granted, healing was somewhat off, but if that third attack had been crushing, or if this had occured during a reverb, I don't know what could have been done.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>
