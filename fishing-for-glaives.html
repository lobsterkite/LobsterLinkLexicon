		<div id="post_message_680253"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I've actually thought about this a few month ago, but could never test the following steps due to my server warglaive population. Now WoR posted about 40% drop rate for a certain guild this comes up in my mind again. <br>
<br>
You need to meet following conditions:<br>
- Server restart - item cache cleared<br>
- Noone with glaives logged yet or it has never dropped<br>
If we meet this 2 conditions server will disconnect us whenever we try to link warglaives in chat.<br>
<br>
Loot is generated upon mob spawn (blue confirmed)<br>
<br>
If you think about this for a second all you need to do is keep spawning BT instances until warglaives can be linked in chat - that would mean this particular instance contains one<br>
<br>
ps. That would also explain why our server had warglaive link on the 1st Nihilum kill, yet they haven't got the drop - some other spawned instance ID had warglaive<br>
<br>
p.p.s. I realise it is a game mechanics abuse borderline, if you find this post inappropriate feel free to remove it<br>

<br>
Sadly our best kill so far dropped our first Glaive ... <br>
<br>
Although globaly this kill might have been realy bad when compared to the other kills that day ? <br>
Is the "worseness" just compared in the realmpool or on the continent ?<br>
Maybe its a revard for having the "worsest" kill last week ?<br>
<br>
My theory revolved arround sacrificing certain classes to the Mob in the right order ...<br>

</div>The instance ID is your raid ID which is somewhat bound to the person with the (L) at the time of instance spawning. You can easily manipulate this by for example disband the raid and let someone else reinvite before going to BT after Hyjal. It should actually suffice to just give the (L) to someone else before the first person steps into BT.<br>
<br>
We used to switch L's a lot back in MC and BWL times in order to try to mess with the loot generation (trying to break streaks).<br>

</div>We'll be able to tell in 2.4. If his GUID changes, chances are good that his loot table did too (since, at that point, it's a new instance of a mob object, by all indications, and from the design that's been hinted at, something in the object constructor is responsible for loot table generation).

</div>Of course it's seeded. Non-quantum computers can't do truly random number generation. However, the seed is really very likely to just be whatever the value of the last random number the server generated is. Given the population of a server and the number of random numbers being generated at any given time, gaming that number is effectively impossible.<br>
<br>
Most "loot conspiracies" boil down to the fact that you run 25-man raid instances once per week, which is 52 samples <i>per year</i>, and even in a 2-chances-per-kill-to-drop scenario, 104 samples is a piss-poor number for drawing statistical conclusions from.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
Drysc revealed just about as much as you're gonna learn from this post. However, finding a way to control the loot generated is obviously still very difficult.<br>
<br>
Loot is generated when the mob is created, not killed.<br>
<br>
There is a variable that determines the loot the mob carries.<br>
<br>
The variable according to Drysc is a <b>time stamp</b>.<br>
<br>
The mobs aren't actually created until someone enters the area.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now obviously there are varying degrees of control that we can or cannot possibly control as players. However, if the time stamp is in seconds for example, it'll be next to impossible to always time something, as server time doesn't display seconds, and I imagine that since mobs are based on the server this would be the most accurate scale. If the time stamp is in minutes that's another story. There are many mobs that can be player spawned to test this theory by simply spawning the same mob at the same time every day. This is a crude simplified way of doing it mind you, because there are still other variables to consider. <br>
<br>
Another such variable to consider is if the time stamp for the loot itself changes. Does it change hourly? Does it change daily, does it change weekly with every server restart, that's another important test. if you have 2 groups kill a mob that spawns at the same time at say 6:47(I RNG'd this :P) and they get the same loot, and then have them repeat the process the next and day they get different loot, it would be impossible/pointless to determine when the item you want is on the time stamp you need.<br>
<br>
In addition spawning monsters in an instance is also a question to consider, do ALL mobs in an instance spawn upon creation, or do you have to get to certain parts of the instance before they spawn, for example is Sumpremus and all of the dragon riders up when you're fighting Naj? Is Mother Shazz and the Council up while you're taking down Teron/RoS/Bloodboil? These are all things that need to be tested and experimented with.<br>
<br>
All that being said, I doubt you'd find people to find the time to dedicate them selves to such precise testing. &gt;_&gt;<br>
<br>
Even knowing all of this, there's still probably no way to force loot generation. To quote Robert R. Coveyou said "<b>The generation of random numbers is too important to be left to chance</b>." <!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_680284"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I had always been under the impression that loot was based on instance ID.  Mostly from anecdotal evidence pre-BC of a raid getting the exact same drops from MC two weeks in a row under the same ID and bosses dying and then getting reset due to a bug or server reset and dropping the exact same loot.<br>
<br>
If GUID can be seen in 2.4 and changes at every wipe it would seem incredibly easy to just start tracking which ones drop warglaives and clear to Illidan one night and let a rogue (who is probably the only one interested enough to do this) continually start and reset him until you get one proven to drop a glaive and then just sit in the instance until the next day.  I know I'd be willing to stay up all night one night if it meant I'd get one the next day.  (assuming the raid didn't then blow it and wipe)<br>
<br>
Edit @Emeraude - Once you're in the temple proper (past Supremus) you can do a /target [insert boss here] to any boss in the dungeon, so they are all spawned by that point at least.  Hyjal, however, certainly operates under different rules.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I actually expect the GUID to be always the same for exactly the same mob. Meaning, Illidan always having the same GUID as well as, say any named mob's GUID. Has there been any explanation what exactly the GUID is ?<br>
<br>
Generally only one single specific mob can be up at any one time, so there's not necessarily a need to change GUIDs of mobs. What can happen I guess is that there is a corpse of a named mob and the named mob is up at the same time.

		<div id="post_message_680302"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->The chance of being able to find out through linking, even if it works, is pretty slim. Items can be linked under the following two conditions:<br>
<br>
- Someone on your server has the item(s), and this person has logged in since the last time your server went down.<br>
- Someone in your battlegroup with the item(s) has participated in a battleground or arena match since the last time your server went down.<br>
<br>
Having killed a boss that can potentially drop an item does not necessarily mean you can link all items the boss can potentially drop. I speak from experience with trying it out here, we were the first guild on our server to progress in Black Temple and Hyjal, and I was incapable of linking the <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32245" target="_blank">[Tide-stomper's Greaves]</a> after our first few High Warlord Naj'entus kills (They have also never dropped for us, much to my annoyance).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_680304"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I would imagine that the loot *is* actually generated when the mob is killed. The decision of what loot will drop, however, is  made when the mob spawns. Basically when the mob spawns, the time of birth is saved, and that is then used to seed the rng that generates the loot when the mob dies. From a programming point of view it wouldn't make much sense to introduce new items into the game world, unless there is a chance that they might actually be seen by players (i.e. the mob can be looted).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Generally only one single specific mob can be up at any one time, so there's not necessarily a need to change GUIDs of mobs.

		<div id="post_message_680316"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Chicken you could test it by trying to locate a server where at least one guild is progressing through BT, but didn't kill Illidan yet. Log into the server before the weekly reset, and try to link it.<br>
<br>
One reason the Warglaive could be linked, could be because a GM that was following Nihilum's raid, touched the item in any way, triggering it to get into the server's cache... Maybe just browsing through the loot list and making bets what they would get...Who knows?<br>
<br>
More technically, another reason could be because the Illidan's script uses the Warglaive's itemId to retrieve the actual weapon model that Illidan wields during the fight. From memory, they seem to be identical, only slightly scaled, and since they are dynamically attached/detached to the mob's model during P1-&gt;P2-&gt;P3 transitions, just like a player wielding weapons, it's a realistic possibility. It also explains why it could be linked after they attempted him, since when he's not engaged, he doesn't wield the weapons...<br>
<br>
Speculating about the loot generation based on what happened during Nihilum's kill doesn't make sense unless we can assert that it holds true on other servers...<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Mobs spawning as entities are very different than the form you see those mobs in. Nobody can say that c'thun phase 1 and 2 are 2 different entities. Nobody can say that the illidan entity doesn't spawn as soon as you zone into BT for first time. RoS phase 1-3 are infact there all the time, they are just hidden entities. RoS encounter doesn't really spawn after you start it. It's not technically elegant to calculate such things during encounters, as it will eventually increase the server side lag, as the server will be under pressure to calculate extra variables in a very short amount of time. That issue is one of the reasons that you see loot lag or spawn lag in games like EvE-Online.<br>
<br>
Generally though I believe that instance mobs and the information related to them are all generated and saved as soon as raid instance is created. Blue did say that instances are different. Such a mechanism is needed to ensure the capabilities of blizzard to make instances in which only maximum of X amount of certain item should drop, yet those drops can be from any random mob.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Another such variable to consider is if the time stamp for the loot itself changes. Does it change hourly? Does it change daily, does it change weekly with every server restart, that's another important test. if you have 2 groups kill a mob that spawns at the same time at say 6:47(I RNG'd this :P) and they get the same loot, and then have them repeat the process the next and day they get different loot, it would be impossible/pointless to determine when the item you want is on the time stamp you need.<br>

</div>A time stamp will almost certainly be sub-second accurate.  The easist way to do this would be to use the OS C function "clock" that returns the number of clock ticks elapsed since the program was launched, in the time unit "CLOCKS_PER_SEC", which on a win32 platform this is usually 100 (1/100th of a second).<br>
<br>
I would be astonished if any system using time stamps for RNG were using a lower resolution time stamp than that.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_680353"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->The most complete information about how WoW uses random numbers can be found here: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080323230503/http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=10271177&amp;sid=1" target="_blank">WoW Forums -&gt; Roll Hacks - 3/21/05</a><br>
<br>
Briefly, WoW uses <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080323230503/http://burtleburtle.net/bob/rand/isaac.html" target="_blank">IBAA</a> to generate pseudo-random numbers. The generator is seeded once when the server process is started (presumably from a time stamp or similar data) and then used for all events in that server process until reboot. That would mean that events in a Deadmines run on the same server can affect whether or not illidan will have a warglaive. Of course, IBAA is meant to be a cryptographically strong random number generator, so even knowing a series of random numbers, you would not be able to predict the next. You can in particular not influence seeding through in-game events, since seeding precedes any in-game events.<br>
<br>
My understanding is also that not all mobs in an instance (or outdoors zone) may spawn immediately when you enter the instance, but only when you come within a certain range, and this is why you can sometimes see mobs casting self-buffs as you approach. That is aside from mobs that are spawned by player actions, such as the opera house in Karazhan, or the Lurker Below, and presumably do not exist (along with their loot tables) until they actually come into existence.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_680407"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I think it's actually an interesting idea.  Before I was done reading the post I thought to myself about how a warglaive suddenly became linkable in the middle of Nihilum's attempts, and people assumed the orange weapon had some role in the fight.  It also explains, for example, why you can't data-mine Kil'Jaeden loot on the PTR -- the entity Kil'Jaeden doesn't actually "exist" and presumably spawns when you arrive at the end of the zone after killing M'uru.  Similarly, is it possible that even back in the AQ40 days people could datamine all the AQ40 loot except C'Thun drops, because the actual mob with the drop table is "C'Thun", which doesn't exist until someone gets to p2 of the fight, and no one did on the PTR?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">As far as I know, each instance runs on its own process so there is no technical need for this. Instances are essentially their own world servers.

</div>I highly doubt that. Most likely, it's a process that runs all instances of an "instance-zone", or even a process that runs all instanced zones. This is necessary to allow static data sharing, reducing not only the amount of memory required, but also the amount of preprocessing on that data when spawning a new instance... The fact that they're using 64bit GUIDs for unit ids, is also a sign that these are to be globally identified. Interestingly, the top word of the GUIDs match for the same mob, which could indicate that the GUIDs are a combination of some kind of ZoneId, mob type, and/or something else, stored in the top word, and then the actual 32bit generated Id...<br>

</div>Yes, hence why I thought it would be interesting to test that. Because there's two ways to reset an encounter; either they destroy and re-spawn all the involved entities, in which case most likely they come in with new GUIDs, or, they hide-reset-show them. If they just hide/unhide then the time-of-birth timestamp probably doesn't chance. If it's recreating the involved entities, then most likely, the new entities will have fresh new GUIDs and a new timestamp, influencing which loot you'll get... This is assuming that the loot is generated when the mob dies, from the saved timestamp, which is itself highly speculative...<br>
<br>
Would be interesting to understand how they implemented these things...<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>So if it were possible to leash Illidan you could keep leashing him until the server lets you link a Warglaive, then kill him. <br>
At least that's how I understood all of the above?<br>
Ofcourse, only possible if the server cache is empty and there are no warglaives online.<br>
This kinda makes me hope they open a new server so I can roll a rogue. You should be able to guarantee some Warglaives ;-)<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Well there's nothing to test on most servers.  On Mal'Ganis someone with Warglaives will probably log on soon after a server reset and there's no way of really knowing for sure if they have or not.  Certainly on most servers this won't work.  <br>
<br>
Also wouldn't it follow that the item has been "seen" on the server once it appears once in someone's instance, even if it's not obtained by a player, if this theory is true?  So even if no one has any glaives, someone zoning into a BT instance in which a warglaive exists on Illidan's table might make the item linkable.  <br>
<br>
The only way to properly test this would be to know for a fact that no one on a given server has a piece of loot, and then to know for a fact that you are the first person to enter the zone in which that loot might spawn after a server reset.  Right?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				The fact that they're using 64bit GUIDs for unit ids, is also a sign that these are to be globally identified.

The "upper-middle" part is the mob-id. Taking Vaeys' example, <a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?npc=24744" target="_blank">Vexallus - NPCs - World of Warcraft</a> is Vexallus. Enter 24744 in DEC, convert to Hex and you'll get 60A8. Compare with the combat log GUIDs:<br>

</div>WoWhead pulls these mob-id numbers out of the MPQ in one of the dbc files. So the lower 3 Bytes denote the variable ID, the following 2 (3?)Bytes denote the mob id and the uppermost part is probably some flags.<br>

				Yes, hence why I thought it would be interesting to test that. Because there's two ways to reset an encounter; either they destroy and re-spawn all the involved entities, in which case most likely they come in with new GUIDs, or, they hide-reset-show them. If they just hide/unhide then the time-of-birth timestamp probably doesn't chance. If it's recreating the involved entities, then most likely, the new entities will have fresh new GUIDs and a new timestamp, influencing which loot you'll get... This is assuming that the loot is generated when the mob dies, from the saved timestamp, which is itself highly speculative...<br>
<br>
Would be interesting to understand how they implemented these things...

</div>Loot is generated on spawn, its really an old argument and confirmed at least twice by blue. Also the community long ago before any confirmation found that there are specific mobs who wear the weapon they are going to drop IF they have that weapon in their loot table. I've seen and confirmed this myself. This would not be possible if loot is determined on kill. It really happens on spawn time.<br>
<br>
So if we were to test this with 2.4 we need to track the bosses that are not there when the instance gets created but spawn later. We can assume this is true for Kil'Jaeden. It certainly isn't true for Kalecgos (unless Sartohvarr or whatever his name is, is spawned dynamically, as we don't loot Kalecgos after all). Brutallus is always present and Felmyst could be dynamically spawned as it is part of the event with Brutallus and Madrigosa. I have no idea about M'uru and Twin Eredars, save that M'uru has 2 phases and one probably loots Entropius.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">The only way to properly test this would be to know for a fact that no one on a given server has a piece of loot, and then to know for a fact that you are the first person to enter the zone in which that loot might spawn after a server reset.  Right?</div>

</div>Yes, that's how I understand the process. Since for a normal live realm you cannot guarantee you are the first to spawn a raid instance, it's probably easiest if one concentrates on observing later bosses which spawn in on player-interaction. So they are not present when the instance spawns and possibly they respawn on wipe.<br>
<br>
It's easier to track server wide raid progression and with that the possibility to engage/activate a boss than trying to ensure no one else runs into the instance and spawns it.<br>
<br>
If you furthermore are the first guild to reach a boss you can check to see if between each pull/attempt, the available loot for linking increases or not. If it does, you can for the first few pulls predict what he would drop. (Unless the entire loot table becomes active for linking once the boss spawns in for the first time)<br>
<br>
I think 2.4 is a unique opportunity to gain a bit of insight into this mechanism.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Blasted Lands, Altar of Storms there (NOT the Altar in Burning Steppes, it's really the one in BL all the way in the west).<br>
<br>
There are 3 types of mobs there. If they don't drop a weapon, they have a default weapon in their hand. If they will drop a weapon, they will show it. There are pics showing them holding a Warden's Staff for example and then of course dropping that one rare drop.<br>
<br>
I didn't see an epic but they certainly showed another weapon when they dropped exactly that weapon. They don't drop weapons often though, so if you want to confirm that, calculate at least an hour of non-stop killing them to see it. However when they wear their "model-normal" weapon, they drop no weapon at all, so that's at least a "half-proof".<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_680537"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Cadfael, my thoughts were following the principle that loot was generated from the mob's spawn timestamp. This timestamp would then be used to seed the rng that determines the loot, hence, what loot can drop is available right from when the mob spawns. It's deterministic, so at any point in time, given a timestamp and a loot table, you could recreate the drops, without actually having this item available in the game world. It's also more efficient to store...<br>
To me, it just doesn't make sense to have each spawned mob in the world store their drops at spawn time, even if it takes as much as 1byte per drop slot(an index into the loot table), it's still at least 4bytes of redundant and possibly useless information. At any given point in time, there are *a lot* more alive mobs then corpses lying on the floor, and not all alive mobs will die...<br>
<br>
Question: Does the server check if a quest item should drop for each quest item that each mob can drop when each mob spawns, and then just doesn't show it on the loot window if the player to loot doesn't have the respective quest, or does it generate the item when the mob dies? Is this a special case?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Cadfael, my thoughts were following the principle that loot was generated from the mob's spawn timestamp. This timestamp would then be used to seed the rng that determines the loot, hence, what loot can drop is available right from when the mob spawns. It's deterministic, so at any point in time, given a timestamp and a loot table, you could recreate the drops, without actually having this item available in the game world. It's also more efficient to store...<br>
To me, it just doesn't make sense to have each spawned mob in the world store their drops at spawn time, even if it takes as much as 1byte per drop slot(an index into the loot table), it's still at least 4bytes of redundant and possibly useless information. At any given point in time, there are *a lot* more alive mobs then corpses lying on the floor, and not all alive mobs will die...</div>

</div>Storage is cheap, that is the answer. It is much more harmful to a live system with lots of action to continously allocate, use and deallocate say 5 * 10 MB of memory than to allocate once 10 * 10MB and always use them, never de-allocate.<br>
<br>
Memory allocation is costly, having your memory lie around is cheap up until that causes you to swap. I guess that's why this is made so. And let's face it, 3000 mobs with each 10 itemIDs a say 1KB of memory is still only 30MB of ram. Who cares about that ?<br>

Is this a special case?

</div>Quest items become invisible if you are not on the quest or if you just fulfilled it. You can check that easily. Get a quest which needs drops. Gather until you have all but one of the quest items and then kill and never loot. Then loot everything except the quest item. You now have several sparkling corpses. Now loot the final quest item. Now try to loot the other corpses and see what happens. The game hides the drop, it just vanished from the corpse.<br>
<br>
So yes, this is a special case. Quest items are always there (if the mob drops it, with quest item dropchance &lt; 100%), you just can't see them if you are not on the quest or if you have your required amount. This is client side stuff.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Can't say what it is for you. If the server is relatively  young, can you link raiddrops ? Could of course always be that the items leak into the realm via BGs.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I'd recommend experimenting with linking items from pre-TBC instances as well. On a new server they're far less likely to suffer from "Battlegroup Contamination", since the amount of people using or still possessing loot from them is small. Especially bosses like Viscidus should be interesting to check, since even pre-TBC he wasn't killed much, and he also doesn't really have many items that people would keep around for sentimental value.<br>
<br>
Raid drop only profession recipes could work as well.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>We were able to link Warglaives and most of the loot from BT on our server long before anyone was even BT attuned, because it had been seen on the battlegroup, and you can link things the server has seen in a battleground even if nobody on your server has seen one.<br>
<br>
I don't think that having an itemID being linkable is a good way to try and predict what would drop, except perhaps on a BRAND new server, but even then.. by the time you had leveled and begun raiding, you would have encountered at LEAST enough items in a battleground to spoil any chance you had at determining what any as-yet-unkilled mob would have dropped.<br>
<br>
You'd need mobs that hadn't been killed on any server in your battlegroup, at least.<br>

</div>Correct me if I'm wrong, but you do not seed the RNG every time you need a random number generated. It's seeded once and then begins creating numbers as requested until such a time as the process is killed and restarted.  This seed would be planted at server boot, and the RNG is then used for EVERY random number request on the server.. every /roll, every mob that spawns, everything.  It's not like every instance ID seeds it's own RNG.  The loot is generated on mob spawn, but it doesn't reseed the RNG based on the mob's spawn time... it just means the game has requested a new random number, which is then provided and used to determine loot.  <br>
<br>
There's no real way to game the RNG.. The only feasible thing mentioned thus far is seeing if previously unseen items become linkable upon mob spawn or only upon mob death.. a test which isn't really possible on current servers, due to pollution by the battlegroup.  The only real test will be seeing at what point Sunwell boss items become linkable before those items have actually dropped on any given battlegroup.  That would give us some insight as to when items "really" exist,  but still doesn't really provide any way to reliably determine what will drop on an ongoing basis.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>The Illidan mob doesn't disappear in between phases, it just becomes again untargettable due to the event-script (or something like that) taking over, which I guess is what causes you to lose target/combopoints from him. This is very similar to what was hypothesized earlier with the hiding/showing again the model not changing the GUID, I guess.

				<div style="font-style:italic">Correct me if I'm wrong, but you do not seed the RNG every time you need a random number generated. It's seeded once and then begins creating numbers as requested until such a time as the process is killed and restarted.  This seed would be planted at server boot, and the RNG is then used for EVERY random number request on the server.. every /roll, every mob that spawns, everything.  It's not like every instance ID seeds it's own RNG.  The loot is generated on mob spawn, but it doesn't reseed the RNG based on the mob's spawn time... it just means the game has requested a new random number, which is then provided and used to determine loot.</div>

</div>I'm not arguing that it's seeded with a time stamp (which  has been confirmed), I'm arguing that it isn't seeded with the timestamp of the mob spawn.  When a mob spawns, and the game goes to generate loot, there's no reason to re-seed the generator, you just get the next random number from the number generator that was seeded when the server came up.  Once seeded, you have ostensibly infinite pseudo-random loot generation from that one seed.  <br>
<br>
Also (and this is not directed at you, Lightstrike), one thing that is incredibly commonly misunderstood is that when they say that a timestamp is used to seed a generator, many people take that to mean that starting your instance at the same time every day is the reason you're having streaky loot.   I swear I wish i had a freaking dollar for every time someone has pulled this out at raid start time "Hey guys, I read that a timestamp determines all our loot.. lets move the raid up an hour!".  A timestamp is often a value like the number of seconds elapsed since January 1st 1970, or the time in milliseconds required to perform a particular system operation...its not something that can be reliably manipulated to effect the outcome.  Streaky loot happens.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Interesting if true. While doing Dire Maul for my Steamwheedle rep (0/36k hated -&gt; 999/1000 exalted, roughly 200 runs) I've noticed the mobs near the zone in being consistent in their pat timing, for example pulling Guard Moldar every single time before a patrolling pack of hyenas cross close to him. Conversely, pats further on in the instance are often faster or slower relative to each other, which could be attributed to different spawning times. I'm not saying that's how it is, but that's what I've observed and it does seem to support the idea.<br>
<br>
That aside, I remember when several Karazhan bosses were bugged and could respawn under certain conditions (killing Aran while he's drinking, for example, subsequent spawns gave different loot. I'd assume that means that <b>even with the same raid ID, a soft reset will wipe all pertinent mob data</b>, and zoning into a soft-resetted zone will result in a different set of loot.<br>
<br>
Lastly, I'm pretty convinced that "unlinkable loot" only becomes linkable when a boss is killed, not when it's spawned. I'm pretty sure Boubouille would have something to say on this matter. :P<br>
<br>
How certain loots became linkable on PTR, how Warglaives were linkable even when Nihilum was attempting Illidan, and how things are linkable that shouldn't be after a server restart, I'd say are caused by other factors - GM's, cross-server battleground contamination, etc.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Sorry, there is no evidence.  Evidence would be in the form of a large, impartial survey of the mobs in question (even only by one person), and not merely anecdotal.  The mob wielding the weapon it drops is almost certainly just a red herring.  In actuality, the likely "coincidence" is due to the fact that the mob would be spawned with a "weapon type" table, similar to a drop table, that says "80% sword + mace, 10% staff, 10% 2h axe".  The ACTUAL "drop table" and the "weapon type" table would pull from the same <b>level range</b> of items so that the <b>flavor</b> of the models you see in WoW are not out of place.  In doing this, you would almost always see an equipped item that looked <b>exactly the same</b> as the equipped item in the event that they are both randomly chosen to be the same archetype.  That does not mean that the weapon type wielded by the mob directly influences the likelihood of it dropping a green of that same weapon type.  It does give overactive human imaginations plenty of fodder, though.<br>
<br>
You can see obvious marked changes in the style of typical item models from 1-70; it is quite sensible to equip the mobs in question with items that are tailored to their particular level in order to make the experience of the game more consistent.  This is true of armor models, weapon models and potentially spell effects.<br>

		<div id="post_message_680886"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->On the Illidian Kill Despawning point (in case it helps), and the loot generation.<br>
<br>
This happened on our first kill last Thursday night. wipe in progress from 7%, manage to get him trapped, and according to combat logs, a fireball's ~30 damage dot component tick from a player killed him after we reached a 100% wipe. (unless he was actually already dead, and it was just still broadcasting actions). He went through the animations, collapsed, and then vanished about 5 seconds later. Contact from a GM took much shorter than expected, and loot was distributed through the mail about 4-5 hours after the kill.<br>
<br>
One of the comments that stands out from the GM was: "Hope you get a warglaive!"... which indicates that he didn't know what dropped. Although he could be a peon-level GM that doesn't have access to the loot tables, it is also possible that they had to 're-generate' the loot table to identify what dropped.<br>
<br>
This then would imply that they could, in-fact, regenerate the table. If the table is originally wiped (and not saved somewhere) when the corpse despawns, then it would help to confirm that the information in the loot table is based on a factor that can be artifically recreated to recreate the exact loot.<br>
<br>
Of course, that is alot of 'if...then' and 'implies', and might simply be that they couldn't re-create the original table, but instead just generate a new table. Which would also indicate that their comments that they have to find out what dropped is misleading.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Sorry, this isn't a survey and is thus inconclusive. How come Kaz'rogal doesn't drop Cataclysm's Edge every time? Excuse me while I be snarky. <br>
<br>
Anyway, a point I meant to convey in my previous post is, I hope that people doing tests realize that as far as we know, unlocking an item requires the boss to have dropped dead, not merely just spawned. There seems to be other factors that can 'unlock' an item. The PTR however seems to be relatively pristine, and loot so far from Sunwell could only be linked after the various bosses were dropped. Exceptions being the pieces that were available from the trade-in vendors.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Just walk your ass out there and look at the mobs.  A large survey of Blasted Lands mobs <b>was done</b>.  Those of us who played the game and wanted to know information remember it.  It's a couple years old now though, and probably lost, but just because you weren't here for it and didn't read it, doesn't make it false.<br>
<br>
Not all mobs are affected by this "feature", but <u>all mobs that are, and when they do not drop weapons always have <b>the same</b> model</u>.  <b>EVERY</b> time one of the affected mobs does not have the standard weapon/shield/off-hand model for their type, they will drop a weapon with the exact same model.<br>
<br>
Again, just because you missed it, doesn't make it less true.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I said they are wrong to make that kind of assertion without providing a reasonable body of evidence, not that they are wrong that the mobs do not in fact work this way.  It has not been <i>proven</i> or <i>disproven</i> and I do not see a reason to waste my time doing so since I am not making a fantastic assertion.  Countless individuals are willing to bet on all sorts of things (like "loot seeding") affecting their game experience but the only thread I've ever seen where any aspect of WoW's loot system was analyzed methodically in order to find any sort of pattern was a recent-ish one that showed that drop tables appear to be segmented rather than one uniform table on the mob where N items are picked randomly among M.<br>

Unfortuntely, said mob also will drop weapons, so we're going to have to discard his drops.

		<div id="post_message_681120"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->On topic, a bit of a wrench can be thrown in the idea of being able to use item linkability as a basis for whether or not the item is going to drop.<br>
<br>
I'm on Echo Isles and the highest guild clears ever here are up to Gorefiend, but I have been able to link every single piece of loot in BT for quite some time. That even includes a period where the one guild that could enter BT at the time had left the server and thus no one would have been in BT at the given time.<br>
<br>
I'm not sure if this lends towards that theory being incorrect or to my observation being skewed somehow, but for what its worth, when I was on Thunderhorn, we didn't have any guilds enter BT for at least the first few weeks, but the loot from Naj and Supremus could be linked before then.<br>
<br>
On a further note, I don't think that it much matters how the loot is decided. If, for instance, we were to determine for sure that the loot was decided upon the boss's spawning as opposed to his death, we would still not be able to effectively figure out from the RNG what numbers would be necessary to cause a glaive to drop. Why? Because there is only one ID for the mob, and that ID doesn't correlate to one item, but rather to a grouping of items, e.g. ID 345678910 causes both Glaives and the staff, not just any single one of those items. We would have to compile an excessively large collection of every boss ID and what items dropped with that ID, and then establish the similarities between all of those IDs until we got a table that might, keyword might, give us some guess as to when a glaive will drop. Even given that, we still run a low chance of being able to manipulate the numbers enough to cause a specific drop.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>The things you're stating are true, and have been previously mentioned in the thread.. you can link items seen in a battleground that have NOT yet dropped on your server, so for all intents and purposes, once something has been seen by your battlegroup it should be safe to link on your server.<br>
<br>
This speculation you're referring to is all based off the simple notion that before Illidan had died on any server, the Warglaives had been datamined, but were NOT linkable until supposedly some point during the night of Nihilum's Illidan attempts.  Now, since Illidan despawns between attempts, the theory is that upon respawn he has re-rolled his loot tables, and would yield different loot than if you had killed him the previous attempt.   This seem to mean that at some point during the Nihilum's attempts, one of the Illidan spawns had rolled to drop a glaive, and that THIS is what made the glaive linkable, even though Illidan didn't die that attempt.  <br>
<br>
As far as I can tell,  It remains to be proven that spawning a mob makes the items he will drop linkable if they have never dropped before, even though the game has already decided to drop those items.  It seems more likely to me that blizzard would want to pull RNG values at the time of mob spawn, but that these values aren't actually applied to a loot table (and thus determine a corresponding itemID) until mob death.... meaning that the loot has been technically predetermined, but you can't trawl for what the boss is going to drop by simply trying to link items that haven't been seen yet.  This is, of course, totally unsubstantiated and largely unprovable until never-before-dropped loot arrives (sunwell) and we can attempt to link IDs that we know for certain have never been seen.   Of course, this raises the question that if indeed this hypothesis is right, I'm then at a loss as to how to explain the linkability of warglaives before Illidan had died, unless it was through some Devloper presence/testing to ensure the item wasn't bugged if it did indeed drop.<br>
<br>
Does this help people get glaives? Nope. Though it's still at least an interesting discussion in the spirit of trying better to determine at what point loot "exists" on the server.  (For that matter, it was my understanding that the server's item cache is only purged during patches, not merely for reboots/maintenance, but perhaps someone has more insight on that.   From my experience, post-patch days are the only days I have historically had issues linking items that I hadn't "seen" before.)<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

A note about timestamps on the systems likely to be running wow they are in mili seconds.<br>
<br>
mm-dd-yyyy hh.mm.sss is the format it is displayed in. And it is stored as a long unsigned integer (64bit) representing the current time in miliseconds from (I don't recall exactly) but like 01/01/1970<br>
<br>
If a time stamp is used to select loot from a table the most obvious choice for random is the last 2 or 3 digits. Because this is SO efficient programatically speaking(and painfully ungamable). I would not have any trouble believing this is how it is implimented by Blizard.<br>

(unless he was actually already dead, and it was just still broadcasting actions). He went through the animations, collapsed, and then vanished about 5 seconds later. Contact from a GM took much shorter than expected, and loot was distributed through the mail about 4-5 hours after the kill.<br>
<br>
One of the comments that stands out from the GM was: "Hope you get a warglaive!"... which indicates that he didn't know what dropped. Although he could be a peon-level GM that doesn't have access to the loot tables, it is also possible that they had to 're-generate' the loot table to identify what dropped.<br>
<br>
This then would imply that they could, in-fact, regenerate the table. If the table is originally wiped (and not saved somewhere) when the corpse despawns, then it would help to confirm that the information in the loot table is based on a factor that can be artifically recreated to recreate the exact loot.<br>
<br>
Of course, that is alot of 'if...then' and 'implies', and might simply be that they couldn't re-create the original table, but instead just generate a new table. Which would also indicate that their comments that they have to find out what dropped is misleading.</div>

</div>I'm not entirely sure you can bet the farm on the GM's word. It's possible he said "Hope you get a warglaive!" while he was typing in a query for the system to retrieve the loot information (i.e. he said that just to pass the time) OR he said that in context of "I don't know what Illidan dropped, server doesn't know what he dropped because we just purged the loot logs, and I'll just roll the dice and pick x amount of items from Illidan's loot table for you to have."<br>
<br>
I have one anecdote too:<br>
<br>
I was in heroic Mech a few months after TBC released, we had just killed one of the minibosses that carried half the Legion's Cache key. One of our members d/c-ed just as we killed him, and it was set to Group Loot. Unfortunately, our d/ced member was the one that had loot rights on the guy.<br>
<br>
So I filed a GM ticket, GM answered while we were killing Panthaleon. GM took a few minutes to "verify" what happened (he/she used that exact word, I have no clue what/if they were verifying). GM tells me 1x Mote of Shadow dropped and half of the Legion Cache key. <br>
<br>
Here's the interesting part: The GM tells me to log out, so he can put the items in my bags. I log out, and I stay at the Character Select screen. I'm on Vent, so I can hear my friends saying that they see my character logging back in (the GM controlling my toon obviously), and then logging back out. I log back into my character, lo and behold, I have the "lost" items in my bags.<br>
<br>
I'm of the opinion that <u>the system stores a list or a log of some sort of what dropped and what was looted</u>. I believe heroics work more or less on the same system as raids, so more than likely what happened in my case would apply to 10man-25man raids as well.<br>
<br>
It seems rather a waste for a system to store a seed number for the loot, and then have a GM "regenerate" the loot if needed. How many 25man raids are going on daily? Simply storing a short list of drops wouldn't waste any space.<br>
<br>
--------------------------<br>
<br>
Actually, a new thought just hit me as I was typing this. Storing a list of drops wouldn't waste ANY space.<br>
<br>
Think about it. We know from past raids that loot is created at dungeon spawn time. As soon as you kill a boss mob, the loot from that boss is available immediately; there is no "loot generation time" from the time you kill a boss to the time you view the loot. That implies that the server is storing that boss's drops by each item's name, not storing a seed number and then generating the loot when the boss dies.<br>
<br>
What harm would it do to remember that boss's drops until the next raid reset, or server maintenance, or "garbage collection" or whatever? After all, the server has to do that anyway for the bosses you didn't kill, just because the server doesn't know if you'll be back to kill the next bosses in the future.<br>

</div>Pretty independent notions.  If a mob had 3 loot "pools" from which to pull, it would ostensibly request a random number for each pool to determine what item drops from that pool.  As it pertains to warglaives, its pretty much irrelevant since they occupy an additional loot slot. <br>
<br>
Theoretically, I suppose you'd have a roll to determine whether you get the extra loot slot, and then upon success, another roll to determine MH or OH glaive.  Though certainly they could determine both the "extra slot" and "MH vs OH" in a single roll, but I'm not sure it really matters either way.. its just a matter of methodology.<br>
<br>
The "loot pool" idea you're referring to is pretty much established and accepted at this point, but doesn't really tie in to the discussion at hand except in the sense that it implies that each boss spawn requires more than one RNG poll to determine what drops from each loot pool.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_681313"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I had the opportunity to talk to an ex-GM today and so I asked him a few question regarding this.<br>
<br>
First I asked him if every GM is able to see what a bossmob is going to drop or if only selected "higher level" GMs can do that. He told me that every GM can look into mobs and what they are going to drop. He said something along the lines of that this is only a specific visibility setting on their specific clients. Whatever that means.<br>
<br>
I asked him then if he'd ever looked into a boss after he respawned to see if the loot changes and he said he never did that and thus doesn't know.<br>
<br>
We talked a bit more and I mentioned the blasted lands mob that display the weapon they are going to drop. He said then that this is an old idea that's been around for a long time and that should finally appear after 2.4 "officially". He also specifically meant that this is not going to be restricted to weapons only but there are some limits or dependencies which I didn't fully understand. He said that there will be individual looks on mobs (ie the mobs of one type look more diverse) and they then drop the armor / weapon in that specific look. <br>
<br>
@Habanero, I've confirmed the behaviour myself about 2 years ago. It's not a study but I'm not going to spend a few hours on a youtube video for your pleasure. I've seen it myself and lots of others did. If you can't accept that, that's fine. Stop arguing though about this minor tangent to the discussion what essentially later has been confirmed not once but twice by blue posters that loot is being determined on mob spawn. This is a tangent because it has nothing directly to do with the OP's posting but I brought it up because it's still often contradicted out of a gut feeling.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_681323"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Are we even sure linking items is consistent enough for this? I can think of times where the ability to link an item did not seem to match the criteria. <br>
Before arena talk was nerfed people were linking items from illidan to get other people to disconnect. However I was able to link the item myself without disconnected, but clicking on the item in arena caused a disconnect. Also my own server had no killed Illidan at all at the time. <br>
Back pre-bc I had a lootlink with Atiesh of the priest version, which I was unable to link on my own server, but I was able to link the warlock version. Other people could link the priest version with no problems. This happened with a bunch of other new items as well. <br>
Im not exactly sure how the game determines what is available for you to see in the item cache. I would assume somehow it is tied to battlegroups who have to see other people in BG/arena. The sunwell patch might be a good time to test this when it goes live.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
Sunwell will be the perfect time to test this.  Walk into SP and start trying to link Brutallus drops (make sure someone else is there and not clicking links to avoid any soft resets while you constantly crash).  If you can safely link two of his items and none of the others (discounting tier pieces) then there's a good chance that loot is loaded on a server cache as soon as it is loaded on a raid boss.<br>

Of course you have to make sure that no one else on the server is going into their own SP and ruining your pristine field...<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Yes, there may be these instance seeds based on a timestamp (or whatever crazy theory you have). But they are a SEEEED in a number generator. If you plug that same seed in multiple times, you will get multiple results. It's simply to start the RNG process, as far as I understand.<br>
<br>
So even if you could create that same seed over and over again, be it a raid leader, a timestamp, or which non-combat pet you have out, it still will not influence any loot drops in any controllable manner.<br>
<br>
I admit I have no knowledge of how these systems, or WoW's in particular handle the random generator, but surely what I said above makes sense.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_681487"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Getting loot from instance or outdoor mob isn't anyway different from each other. The most people have witness this before by server rollback. I recall several times when I have looted some items and server has roll backed resulting loose of items and mob spawn again where it was killed. Killing same mob again results different items. Same principle most likely is used on instances.<br>
<br>
So, each time dungeon soft resets, server creates loot table to bosses that are available when you enter. If you clear half instance first day and come back another it has different loot table generated than before. By doing like this, you save valuable storage space by not holding hundreds null instance loot tables etc more than few hours until dungeon reset by itself.<br>
<br>
Like it was posted by blue, when person enters instance and "create" it, loot is randomly rolled and I think its impossible to determinate any way what some creature holds. It would require cracking blizzard server database and I wouldn't recommend to do that.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Sorta. A non-quantum deterministic RNG is just an algorithm that takes one number in, and spits another number out.<br>
<br>
Consider this (very simple, not-very-random) algorithm:<br>
<br>
1) Multiply your seed by 86<br>
2) Perform modulo 100<br>
3) Return new number.<br>
<br>
Input: 43, * 86 = 3698 % 100 = 98, which is your new "random" number.<br>
<br>
Every time you put 43 in, you get 98 out. Now, RNGs typically work by using the last generated number as the input for the next number, so the next time we call our random function, we get:<br>
<br>
98 * 86 = 8428 % 100 = 28<br>
<br>
And the next time:<br>
<br>
28 * 86 = 2408 % 100 = 8<br>
<br>
So, you seed the RNG with 43, then the next 3 random rolls are <i>always</i> 98, 28, 8.<br>
<br>
Typically, you want to see your RNG with a number when you first start your program. The classic value is an integer representation of the timestamp (number of seconds elapsed since Jan 1, 1970 is a common one). This produces a different seed each time the program is run, and thus, a different series of numbers.<br>
<br>
Thus, the best way to game the loot system would be a) /random until you get the seed you want, and b) zone in. However, this assumes that:<br>
<br>
a) Blizzard doesn't re-seed the RNG with the timestamp on instance zone-in<br>
b) The instance server contains the same memory space as the non-instance server, so both servers share the same random seed, or the instance server's seed is initialized based off of the world server's last random number value.<br>
c) Nobody else causes anything to happen that invokes the random number function between the time you roll your seed number, and the time you zone in and the loot tables are initiallized.<br>
<br>
One thing about timestamp-based seeding: It doesn't work like "It's 5:49 PST on Wednesday" - instead, it generally counts either seconds since system boot, or seconds since epoch (traditionally Jan 1, 1970). Thus, even zoning in at the exact same time every week would not reproduce that RNG seed.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Not quite correct. First, it's a Psuedo-random number generator, not a true number generator (true RNGs don't have seeds anyways). If you put the same seed into two identical PRNGs, you will in fact get the exact same string of values, for as long as you desire to evaluate the PRNG algorithm.<br>
<br>
The actual randomness comes from when you sample. If you plug the same PRNG seed into two WoW servers, and let them run, they will start exhibiting divergent behavior as on one server someone is using those seeds to determine rogue poison procs, and on another to determine the loot off deadmine mobs.<br>
<br>
So basically while the WoW number generator is technically a deterministic PNRG, so long as you share that PRNG with other people you're sampling it at effectively random intervals, making it a truely random system. The characteristics of PRNGs (particularly, the analogue of independence of events in true RNGs) ensure that a very small amount of randomness in sampling is sufficient to ensure effectively complete randomness of sampled numbers.<br>
<br>
That's a completely academic consideration, though. The question at hand is whether it is possible to determine the result of a sampling before you permanently lose the option to re-sample.<br>
<br>
<br>
EDIT: (followup to antiarc's reply) Note that if every 43 is followed by a 98, it's a crappy PRNG because events are not independent. Every time you saw a 43 you would know the next N events. This is generally solved by (eg) having a similar system carried out behind the scenes to 4 digits, but only reporting the first two, effectively giving each reported "43" one hundred possible types of 'true' 43 it could be, each with its own different target. Of course, in this case the next two or three numbers would be sufficient to characterize its current state. Cryptographically secure PRNGs (which blizzard uses) have an unreasonably large interval required to uniquely identify the seed--generally larger than the data capacity of the internet.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>This has been discussed before, there're most likely one table per drop; that is 5 tables for illidan. Something like this:<br>
<br>
[tier]<br>
[tier]<br>
[crap] (50% on random loot)<br>
[crap] (rest of random loot)<br>
[glaives] (big chance for empty, small chance for either)<br>
<br>
This guarantees that two same random epics cant drop, while two same tier pieces can drop.<br>
<br>
Moreover, loot is generated on drop, so link-trying wont help any bit in attempt to find out loot. Try zoning in raid zone on fresh server and query for some certain drop (quest drop most likely exist as you can link them via available quests).<br>
<br>
Furthermore, "time stamp" referred earlier is probably unixtime, it's pretty certain that wow backend doesnt run on x86 or am64 or other "desktop" hardware (according to job descriptions etc)<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_681668"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->One thing that was suggested from the beginning of this thread that I haven't seen addressed much is whether the cache clears on server restart.  I would expect that if it was and one were to log in immediately after the servers came up, you'd be unable to link anything even slightly esoteric.  While its possible that Teebu's is generated in some mob's loot somewhere on the server, just looking for the epic drops from level 60 dungeons should generate issues.  Perhaps the best one to look for is the <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=12871" target="_blank">[Chromatic Carapace]</a> which is unlikely to exist even for those who have looted in.  <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=12731" target="_blank">[Pristine Hide of the Beast]</a> would be another option.  <br>
<br>
I just find it extremely difficult to believe that the item cache is cleared when the game restarts; it would seem to use up a lot of needless processing to refill the list every one to two weeks.  On the other hand, if every item that come into existence in the game needs to check the cache to see if its there already, I suppose the additional time to add it to the cache is tiny compared to the number of requests.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">One thing about timestamp-based seeding: It doesn't work like "It's 5:49 PST on Wednesday" - instead, it generally counts either seconds since system boot, or seconds since epoch (traditionally Jan 1, 1970). Thus, even zoning in at the exact same time every week would not reproduce that RNG seed.</div>

</div>Latency will also add an effective extra random value to this, depending on the precision of the Timestamp. Even if the Timestamp was restarted after every server reboot, you still most likely wouldn't be able to zone in at the exact same time causing the exact same loot to be created, due to the fact that latency will mean the server might very well progress your request just a second sooner or later.<br>
<br>
As others have said though, it's more likely that a single PRNG function is called for all random numbers WoW needs, and due to the fact that there's probably a very large (and very varying) amount of requests made to this function per second, the results of any individuals requests are basically going to be random for all intents and purposes.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>This is really the nice thing about WoW or any MMO in terms of RNG. Some level 12 hunter killing worgen in Silverpine influences whether Illidan will drop warglaives for your guild. His pet gets a crit just a microsecond before your raid leader steps into BT and then four hours later your rogues are crying because "it never fucking drops for us". Blame that pet then? Or blame the millions of calls to random() which came before that?<br>
<br>
If you think back long before MMOs, back to the time of single-player games on a network with a shared highscore table, for example <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080323230934/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hack_%28video_game%29" target="_blank">Hack</a>. Those games were often seeded with the lower 16 bits of the unix time() function. Which meant that, since you'd likely have the source code, you could calculate a list of seeds to give your game (your personal instance) optimal starting conditions. Then it was just a case of spawning several games whenever the timestamp would provide a good seed and saving them for later play...<br>
<br>
The OP has an interesting idea, because he realises that a better thing than somehow 'influencing' a RNG is to let it reroll. This is presuming the Illidan who eventually drops the glaives doesn't recreate his loot table on wipe, and that you can even find a battlegroup with no glaives in the item cache. The problem is that if you do find a workable usable trick to guessing what a mob will drop, then won't it just be nerfed/hotfixed immediately? Otherwise what was the point of Blizzard making it random in the first place? And if, as has been suggested, in WotLK more mobs will show the weapon they will drop, won't they be forced to limit this to non-raid mobs? Otherwise you spend Tuesday/Wednesday evening spawning lots of raid instances until you get the perfect set of drops for your group?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Agreed. The people here that say "keep /roll ing until you get the number you want then zone in" are missing this point. By the time your brain has registered the number returned, the server has already moved on to the next few hundred numbers. <br>

Check this mob's attack table...<br>
Check if that potion just increased the alchemy skill...<br>
Generate the damage value on that attack...</i><br>
etc...<br>

Processor speeds on common desktops are running 2.5 to 4 million calculations per second.. even if a fraction of them are for the PRNG, actually predicting the sequence and acting on it is simply beyond human reaction/control times.<br>

</div>If Blizzard does indeed do this, at an attempt to add more life into the world, I am sure they will be working on a solution to prevent reset-farming. One easy method is doable similar to ZA, where you get saved before you have a chance to see any of the boss drops.<br>
<br>
And remember, there are tons of drops that are desirable from dozens of bosses out there that don't have an visual representation, so an image change would not indicate yes/no on those particular drops. <br>
<br>
Would guilds even kill Illidian if they knew he wasn't going to drop a warglaive? I think so. After-all, there are only so many rogues/warriors in any 1 guild that would use them. The rest of the raid needs upgrades too.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Actually, just the opposite.  The assumption is that Illidan would indeed generate a new loot table with each respawn (each wipe).  The idea would be if you were to SOMEHOW have the perfect set of circumstances, and had a server without the glaives in the item cache, then began wiping until a glaive could be linked, that he would drop the glaive if you killed him that time.  It's a neat theory, but pretty much an impossible set of circumstances.<br>
<br>
I'm still of the opinion that it wouldn't work.  While we know that loot drop is determined on mob spawn, I don't think an item counts as "seen" by the server (and is thus linkable) until that bosses death occurs and it become a lootable item. Still, no real way to test that idea until sunwell, and even then it would be a difficult undertaking considering that you'll have to consider every sunwell instance on your battle group could be creating linkable loot.<br>
<br>
You're right though, even if this does work I'm sure they'll fix it.  Still, it's an interesting discussion to try and suss out a reasonably unknown mechanic.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">This has been discussed before, there're most likely one table per drop; that is 5 tables for illidan. Something like this:<br>

[tier]<br>

[crap] (rest of random loot)<br>
[glaives] (big chance for empty, small chance for either)<br>
<br>
This guarantees that two same random epics cant drop, while two same tier pieces can drop.<br>

Moreover, loot is generated on drop, so link-trying wont help any bit in attempt to find out loot. Try zoning in raid zone on fresh server and query for some certain drop (quest drop most likely exist as you can link them via available quests).<br>

</div>I agree, this is one of the nice things about it.  So nice that, before the recent Blue post confirming "loot is generated when the mob spawns," if I wasn't in a run and something I wanted dropped, I would shrug it off under the viewpoint of if I had been there, the RNG would have been in a different state, and loot would have been different -- so I didn't really miss anything.  It really was nice to not resent missing a run with this philosophy!  But, alas, the blue post did come out, confirming that the loot is determined well ahead of any influence I could have in-instance.  There does seem to still be an open question of soft resets vs loot, but it is deterministic enough that I'm back to ruing when something drops and I'm not there to get it.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I understand this, certainly.  The point remains though, that there may well be a difference between "the loot that's going to drop has already been determined." and "the loot that's going to drop will be LINKABLE without disconnecting you."<br>
<br>
The ONLY example (or "proof", if we can consider it such: I only know about it because Gurg mentioned it, but I don't know the real source of the anecdote) anyone has to go off of is that a Warglaive became linkable at some point during Nihilum's attempts on Illidan.  We can't really safely assume based on this one example that simply because the loot has been pre-determined that has been added to the server's item cache and is thus linkable.<br>
<br>
I'd love to think that this were the case. I _want_ this to be the case - but we're drawing a conclusion based on a single sentence from a single blizzard community representative. It seems like a reasonable assumption based on what he did confirm, but it isn't proof. Realistically, everything is still speculative except the fact that the loot roll is done at mob spawn, but this doesn't mean the item exists as linkable, right?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Rack, the Phylactery is not itself a quest item. Think about it. Quest items are marked clearly "Quest Item".

</div>I was guessing the Phylactery would work like <a class="q1" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=23338" target="_blank">[Eroded Leather Case]</a>, once you do the quest you'll never see it on a mob again.  I guess it doesn't matter, since the server would have to know about the item anyway in order to know to hide it from you, thus popping it into the cache.<br>
<br>
Edit: Did some pre-testing making macros and such for linking.  One issue I forgot about Kel'T: He's in Frostwyrm, which doesn't have to spool up until you clear all 4 wings (I seem to remember a load screen the one time I went there), thus I couldn't link his Phylactery before or after spooling up a Naxx.  Then again, this might make this the perfect item to test with, but the only problem is that you'll have to clear out the 4 wings, and see exactly when the Phylactery would become linkable.  There would be a nice <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=23206" target="_blank">[Mark of the Champion]</a> or <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=23207" target="_blank">[Mark of the Champion]</a> at the end for whoever was bored enough to try.<br>
I could link the head of the staff, but that's from someone's sitting on &lt;40 splinters I'm guessing.  Also, I couldn't get DC'd just from linking, even crazy stuff like <a class="q6" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=192" target="_blank">[Martin Thunder]</a>.  The link just would generate a blank information window, if anything, and sending the link to myself would result in the item name in just plaintext.<br>
<br>
Looks like I'll need a different item to probe with.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

It may be fixed by now, but the last version of the Eredar Twins on the PTR's was able to drop the same item more than once. Our last kill we had 2 of those melee daggers, and then the rest of the pieces, (I believe total was 2x dagger, 1x cloth dps shoulder, 1x hunter shoulder, 1 war/hunt/sham bracer token).<br>
<br>
That's for sure the only time I've ever seen something like that happen though, and is likely a bug.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I.E., is the information stored at spawn is not the item, or item ID, but instead a value that can be used to return the item itself when mob dies? Whether a RNG based seed to re-generate the same random roll, or a different ID that links to that particular mob's potential loot list.

<br>
Blizzard frequently notifies the community about hack attempts on their servers, including most recently a post about the impact of buying/selling gold, in which they said that server hacks are a common method attempted by these individuals to get gold. If these hack attempts are even as frequent as they let us know about (and are likely WAY more frequent), then they would have some level of team within their company specifically dedicated to concealing and protecting server side information. Concealing loot lists through some conversion is probably a trivial task that they have already addressed, and most likely has already been a direction of attack for these ill-meaning hackers.<br>

I may be way off-base in some of these assumptions...<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>It seems very likely that it works that way. Probably Blizzard has a table per server in which the itemids of known items get added. When a client requests item data, the server just has to look if the itemid is stored in that table and deliver the information if the item is known. It wouldn't make much sense to add the items to this table before the mob actually dies or is looted, because it could be exploited like it is suggested in this thread and because it would add unneeded database queries.<br>
<br>
On Nihilums first kill only the mainhand was linkable and it seems much more likely to me, that a GM created the item, which is also the reason why you sometimes can link Martin Thunder, The Ashbringer or the old Artifact Warglaives.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>The point is that quest items (items marked clearly as "Quest Item" such as <a class="q1" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=2378" target="_blank">[Skeleton Finger]</a>) are ALWAYS available on the item database, since the server would theoretically have to know about the item in the first place to figure out whether it should drop for you (i.e. if you had the quest or not).<br>
<br>
Now, just as an example, if nobody EVER went to AQ40 on your server cluster, you could try using <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=21579" target="_blank">[Vanquished Tentacle of C'Thun]</a>, since the server doesn't need to allow you to link it, until it drops or a C'thun spawns with it in the loot table.<br>
<br>
But you could NOT use <a class="q1" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=22733" target="_blank">[Staff Head of Atiesh]</a> because that is always in the item table, it is always available because the server needs to know whether or not to drop it, depending if you're on the Atiesh quest.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Warglaives would be a bad place to put this theory into practice.  What would be a good way to use it is if you're a cutting edge guild.  Theoretically there could be 2 uses:<br>
<br>
1)  If you're working on a server/cluster first, you can (hypothetically) link the loot the mob has.  A soft reset will change this.<br>
<br>
2)  If there are a relatively low number of kills on your server/cluster, you can zone into Sunwell after a server comes back up from maintenance and start linking loot to determine if what you want is there.  When you find a good instance (probably by strength in numbers), you can keep it open until raid time.<br>
<br>
Either could be useful for finding low-drop rate, high-desirability Sunwell loot, but not really for any BT loot.  But the methodology to do this is a)  complex, b)  dependent on luck, c)  Only useful for a few weeks, and d)  kind of exploitive.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Take a look at the list - there are several items on there that I can't imagine anyone would even bank when you get better stuff leveling to 70, and then easily through Karazhan, PvP or Badges. Perhaps an occasional fluke, but not the entire loottable, especially if probed just after a server restart. Worth a try to confirm on Tuesday/Wednesday, but personally I think it is a pretty long shot to expect item linking behavior to be indicative of actual loot on NPCs even under these circumstances.

If this does work then your surely going to see people in trade channel going "WTS BT instance guaranteed Warglaive PST."

		<div id="post_message_683952"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->As interesting as this is. I find it difficult to believe that anything will come of it. I would imagine that the way WoW does loot is probably both time and space sensitive.<br>
<br>
By that I mean that they probably have a list of loot with values assigned that all add up to essentially 100%. Then the values are rolled by a random seed. There can only be so many different combinations of loot. If Server side they saved a value for your boss. That value may equal out to 2 specific tier drops, 2 specific random drops, and no glaive. But next week if the same random number was put in by chance, why couldn't they have rearranged the values of the %s based on the server start time that week?<br>
<br>
I hope that makes sense but I think I rambled a bit too much. <br>

Just another thought about the PRNG itself. What if the Algorithm(sp?) that is used to create the numbers is based on the server start time planted within it somewhere. That means the exact pattern of numbers would vary from week to week. Making it almost impossible to predict the results of a given spawn time for Illidan, and even more difficult because even if you cracked the algorithm they used you would still have a variable that you can neither control nor pinpoint, the precise server start time.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>That is the very meaning of a seed. Yes, the PRNG uses a seed that according to blizzard is the timestamp of server start. The IBAA algorithm makes finding the seed itself very hard, but a normal LCG (like the srand function in C) is easily crackable.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_684040"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Celestara, you are correct. Nothing will come of it. And even if the algorithm for the seed is cracked it's all but useless.

</div>Well, firstly, the server start time is based (usually) on milliseconds since some date - not by the time of day. Secondly, since it's based on milliseconds, it will vary no matter <i>how</i> precisely they attempt to time the server start, simply due to miniscule variations in conditions causing performance fluctuation. Thirdly, even if it were possible to somehow "crack the seed," doing so would be essentially useless on a cryptographic strength RNG, because there is no reasonable way for you to calculate the next result - the fact that the loot generation table is used for every single loot event in the game makes it much, much too complicated.<br>
<br>
I have no idea of why people seem to have the funny idea that they could force the RNG itself. The notion of being able to tease the system into telling us what loot is in the instance is plausible, although still unlikely. The notion of being able to predict loot based on something (exact time that you logged into the server) is laughable. Even if they literally used the time the first person zoned into the instance and spawned all of the mobs as the seed for the instance's loot - which would be pointless, since they could just request another RNG from the already seeded server-wide loot RNG - it would not be possible to accurately predict the time that you zoned into the instance. We're not talking about being accurate to the second here. The most conservative estimate would put this at 1/100th of a second: No one has a ping that stable. I'm willing to bet that it would be difficult to manage that kind of precision from a computer on a different switch on Blizzard's internal network, let alone from an external connection.<br>
<br>
You cannot "seed" an instance in any way. The only reasonable way you may be able to influence loot mentioned in this topic is through linking itemIDs that should not be available yet to see if they're made linkable by the mob spawn, then resetting the instance if you don't want those items. There is a reason they call them cryptographic-strength RNGs and use them for security.<br>

</div>True, on both counts =P.<br>
A cryptographically secure PRNG means that you can't infer the seed from any string of outputs in a reasonably small amount of time computationally (and the length of string necessary is also unreasonably large), and that lookup tables are generally on a size scale comparable to the universe itself. Given the seed, finding the next value is easy--that is, in fact, what the PRNG itself does. That shift in division of labor doesn't change the basic point though: you still can't predict the next roll based on the previous ones.<br>
<br>
<br>
This PRNG stuffness is all completely a fantastical aside anyways. The issue at hand is being able to see the value before losing the chance to re-roll it. Prediction and method of generation don't matter; you keep trying until you find the instance you want, regardless of how they are generated.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>In terms of sending the zone in request to the server, 1/100th of a second precision is doable at offpeak times for anyone with a good connection who lives within a few miles of the server.  However, unless the RNG is seeded with the time the player zoned in rather than the current time when the RNG is created, there is probably too much variance in how much time passes between the instance creation beginning and the RNG creation.<br>
<br>
Any method that involves trying to game the RNG is doomed to failure.  Imagine that when you zoomed into an instance it simply asked you what you wanted the seed to be.  Calculating a seed that gives you Warglaives would be difficult even if every step of the process was fully deterministic, you had the full source code and the "RNG" was just (i++ % 100).  You'd have to figure out what order mobs spawned in, find out what the roll should even be to give a Warglaive, and then find a seed that gives that roll.  Without the source code, I doubt reverse-engineering the loot generation code to the required extent is even possible.  I can't think of any way for us to find out the mob spawning order other than possibly the GUID, nor any way for us to know what the roll should be to generate a Warglaive.<br>
<br>
Experimentation could work -- each week, use a new seed until you find one that gives you Warglaives, then use that one until you run out of people to give them to.  However, it's very unlikely that WoW ever reuses seeds.  Barring time travel, it's only a given number of milliseconds since the epoch once.  Once you find a "good" seed, you get your one Warglaive, and then can never use it again.<br>
<br>
In addition, loot generation could easily be nondeterministic.  Each instance may not have it's own RNG.  The mob spawning code could be multithreaded.  There may be other random factors involved in the creation of instances.  If it isn't deterministic, even reusing the seed from an instance that gave you a Warglaive wouldn't necessarily give you another one.<br>
<br>
Even if Blizzard had gone out of thier way to make it possible to game the RNG, it would be very difficult at best.  Trying to game a very good and cryptographically secure PRNG like IBAA is a complete waste of time.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Think out your position a little more and you'll see why it's not a good one to take. First, more Warglaives  in the world is not as bad as you make it seem. It's highly unlikely that any guild will, before WotLK hits, use any method to create enough Warglaives to satisfy all of their melee DPS. And even if they do, what idiot would begin saving money right now, which they would have to do, in order to buy even one out of said guild once they begin selling. And you propose that this person has only S1 gear? The two ideas simply do not mesh. No one who has that level of dedication shows it by having a lack of gear.<br>
<br>
Second, if it does become possible to create Warglaives by gaming instance drops using this method, Blizzard will swoop down on it in an instant. One of two things will happen. Either they will make people unable to use the method, making the point moot, or they will make future legendaries solely available through non-gameable methods, ala Atiesh. And everyone agrees that's a much better way of dealing out Legendaries, as it removes the ability to get screwed by the RNG.<br>

</div>That's exactly right. It really makes this whole thread pointless. If a method is arrived at, and is publicized to *any* degree, then it will be hotfixed with *great* enthusiasm on Blizzard's part. If a method is arrived at, and is not publicized but instead kept as some kind of "insider's secret", then it will be all but unusable without arousing suspicion. Even if attempts to game the system might seem innocent at first, I can't imagine Blizzard actually letting players keep the items, even if they don't punish them more directly.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>That's already happening. It's called arena epics. There are people on my realm that will carry you to a high personal rating, and/or points. What's the difference?<br>
<br>
Honestly I think you're getting all bent out of shape for nothing. Sure, a rogue/warrior with twin Warglaives looks cool as all get out, but all it tells me is that he/she has been lucky on Warglaive drops. It tells me nothing about that particular guild's skill, or even about the player himself. Plenty of guilds have been killing Illidan for months without a single Warglaive drop, or just one of them. You can't tell me that those guilds are somehow inferior to guilds that have 1 or more complete sets of Warglaives.<br>
<br>
Do you really mean to tell me that, in your view, a rogue with Warglaives is somehow better than a warlock with the <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32483" target="_blank">[The Skull of Gul'dan]</a>, or a priest with <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32496" target="_blank">[Memento of Tyrande]</a>? All of those items drop off Illidan, and only skilled people would get any of them.<br>

Both times, our guild bank gave them (or outright bought) the majority of the materials required to craft the weapons, guild alchemists gave them free xmutes, guild miners sent them mats, and plenty of people who couldn't help via professions helped by sending loads of gold.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">The game has been that way since its inception...making the drops anything other than random means room for exploitation.  Would you like Blizzard to remove the RNG so that some Chinese farmers come in and get good at raiding, then suddenly they're selling runs to every s1 geared idiot that has money and/or, even better, BUYS GOLD from them to PAY THEM for runs?  Does that sound appealing to you?  Because that's <b>exactly</b> what would happen.<br>
<br>
It would lose every bit of elite status it has.  You make it anything other than random and you take away its status.<br>
<br>
EDIT: Also, seeing that loot is random, and entire guilds don't raid solely for loot, there is no such thing as 'being screwed on drops.'</div>

</div>I agree with you on this, I always -liked- the fact that pre BC legendaries forced you to work on them, whether it was Atiesh, Sulfuras, or the TF. It took a real guild effort to make them, and as a guild, you could proudly say, we banded together and forged x amount of TFs, Sulfuras and Atieshs.<br>
<br>
TBH the whole Legendary system feels weak to me. Dual warglaives, DPS wise, are only marginally better than normal epics. The only thing that makes it Legendary is the name, the design, and the set bonuses. Thori'dal, the Stars' Fury is the same. DPS-wise it's not much of an upgrade, but the "cool" factor is easily made up for by the fact that it creates its own arrows and quiver bonus. The difference in DPS between a warglaive rogue and a rogue holding T6-quality epic weapons is almost nonexistent, especially if the mob in question isn't a Demon. <br>
<br>
I'd like to see more Legendaries where we get an awesome "noncombat" bonus, like the ability of Atiesh to create a portal to Kara. That alone is worth keeping it in your bags.<br>
<br>
EDIT: apparently the system isn't allowing me to item link Thori'dal, so you'll have to take my word for it.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>He disappears after every attempt, like Illidan does when you fight.<br>
<br>
The theory went that Warglaives appeared during Nihilum's attempts because he was despawning each attempt and such.<br>

Surely We're not the only ones working on Kalecgos at the moment, can anybody else weigh in? &gt;_&gt;<br>

		<div id="post_message_694792"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Just to clarify, are we generally assuming that this loot generation is tied to that night's instance only?  I ask this because our guild recently bought a Council + Illidan clear for some HoD from another on our server, and we ended up getting a MH Warglaive drop.  I believe they had just killed Mother, and the instance had yet to soft reset, so I would assume that we still had their loot table.  The comment had been made in guild chat that if they had stuck it out and tried to kill him that week, the glaive would've been theirs, but I'm not sure that this is the case, since they probably would have been doing it the next day after a soft reset.  Any thoughts on that scenario?<br>
<br>
On a side note, our guild managed to be very shortsighted, and we didn't have a single rogue/warrior in the raid who needed the MH, so it ended up going for a free-for-all bid, resulting in this: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080408032254/http://i31.tinypic.com/103eueo.jpg" target="_blank">http://i31.tinypic.com/103eueo.jpg</a>.

		<div id="post_message_695683"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->All this talk about "seeding instances" or "seeding a mob" is fundamentally misunderstanding what a seed is.  When the server comes up, it's RNG gets seeded <b>exactly once</b>, most likely with the number of milliseconds that have passed since midnight on 1/1/70.  It is never seeded again -- there's no need to, because once it's seeded you have an endless stream of random numbers to work with.<br>
<br>
Assuming the other information in the thread about servers only having a single RNG is true, then every bit of non-determinism affects every other bit of non-determinism.  Not only is what loot you get affected by what other mobs loot is, but it's affected by every crit/non-crit decision, every time a random damage value for a weapon hit is picked, etc, for every person on the server, as well as how many of these things have happened since server startup.<br>
<br>
With a good RNG, there's simply no way to predict the next number except knowing the original server-startup seed and knowing the exact quantity of random number requests that have happened since server startup when the mob in question is spawned.  And there's absolutely no way anyone can know that.<br>
<br>
So, please, everyone stop talking about "seeding" happening at any time other than server startup.  That's not how it works.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
It would've all but certainly been theirs. The loot Illidan has is almost certainly determined when you spawn Black Temple. Once you are using a Raid ID of a spawned instance, it's the same loot that would've been there no matter who killed Illidan, no matter whether there was a soft reset. At least that's the best understood version of how it works. There is some notion that the "thereness" of Illidan is somehow relevant to his loot table, but that's surely not the issue.<br>
<br>
I suppose there exists some question as to whether bosses spawn their loot rolls upon the kill or not. In that case, no, it wouldn't have matter if they killed Illidan; it only matters that you do at the time you did. But it doesn't actually seem to be the case it works that way. That said, you still can't "find warglaives."<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Well, that's why I said "Assuming the other information in the thread about servers only having a single RNG is true" (I remember seeing something about that in this thread but I can't seem to find it now).  They wouldn't necessarily have a single PRNG for each server cluster, and I didn't say that they did (why increase internal network traffic for random numbers?) -- I said they'd most likely have a single PRNG for each server.  The salient point is that it's unlikely that they're using separate PRNGs for loot determination and hit/miss rolls and mob spawning and everything else, so everything is likely affecting everything else, and the PRNG is likely being hit thousands of times a second, if not more.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_696402"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->It's not that hard to think of a scenario where loot generation would be from a "clean" RNG.  One is the following situation:<br>
1) Each process creates its own RNG<br>
2) Each instance is a seperate process<br>
3) Mob creation/loot generation order is deterministic<br>
<br>
None of these seem impossible to me.  There's no reason to share a RNG between processes. IBAA isn't reentrant so each worker thread may even create its own RNG (although I can't imagine random number generation consumes enough time that its nessesary). If they aren't shared, it's entirely possible that there is no random noise from combat/etc.  There's so many different ways that it could be implemented that we can't safely assume anything at all about the implementation.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>This we've been told, and have to accept as truth.  However, we do not know if loot is created on mob spawn, nor do we know that respawning a boss mob actually creates a new mob, or merely reinitializes the existing one.  Just because the GUID you see on your client changes doesn't mean the underlying structure on the server is a new one.<br>
<br>
For instance, when a creature is spawned, it's "loot list" could be populated with item IDs that are randomly pulled from it's loot table.  Given that these are only the item's ID, the item itself has not been generated, and therefore does not appear in the server's cache.  This would save on resources, as an item ID is only a single 32-bit integer.  Do not confuse this with an item's GUID, which from what I know is a combination of the item's ID and attributes.  <br>
<br>
Lemme pause here to elaborate on this from some stuff I learned back when I used to play with a previous Blizzard game, Diablo II.  Blizzard was nice enough to provide us with a copy of a large portion of their server code, including that for item generation and for the storage of item structures.  The item as you see it on the client was referenced by a GUID, that referred to that particular item.  People assumed this was an item's global identifier, but it was not.  Future patches and the release of the dupe-removal system implied that items actually contain a separate, unique identifier (we'll call it a UID) that determined an item no matter where it went (though the code for this was not included in the local server code).  Because the duplication methods in place usually involved the same item being "copied" from place to place (as in buying it from a vendor multiple times), each copy of the item retained this UID no matter where it went.<br>
<br>
So, back to WoW items and the GUID that you see.  This is most likely NOT the UID of the item.  This would be generated on upon the actual creation of the item itself, and stored only on the server, where you can't see it.  If they learned anything from D2, they would know that this is invaluable in detecting duplicate items that result from certain strains of duplication methods.<br>
<br>
My theory on this is that for every item created, it follows a 3-step process.  First, the item ID is determined when the mob spawns.  Second, when the mob is killed, this ID is retrieved and looked up in the server's item cache.  If the item exists in the cache, it spawns a copy of that item with a new UID, and this is the loot you receive.  If the item does not exist, it pulls it from it's database, inserts it into the server's cache, and then spawns a copy of the item as loot.  With this model, you could think of the item cache as being a server's "template" for an item, and each particular item being an "instance" of the item.  The item "master" would be the database from which the server pulls the template for the first time.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, I can't prove this is how item creation works.  It's just a working theory based on what I've seen.  Disproving this would be (relatively) easy.  If you isolate an item that does not exist in the server's cache, and then cause it to appear in the server's cache by resetting an instance repeatedly, then you have proved that the item is actually pushed to the cache on mob spawn. <br>
<br>
You could <i>possibly</i> prove this theory by getting lucky with loot drops:  Determining that an item does not exist in the server's cache, and then receiving that item upon that particular kill of the boss.  You would have to ensure that this item still was unlinkable prior to every boss attempt, in the case that the mob's loot table is actually regenerated upon respawn.<br>
<br>
A third test could be used to determine if resetting a boss does indeed refresh it's loot cache, but it would be dependant upon disproving the 3-step method of item creation.  If you can indeed link loot after repeatedly resetting an instance, the next step would be to reset the boss without resetting the instance in an attempt to determine if different loot is now linkable.<br>

		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>The exact quote from the blue post was "Each server process has it's own unique random number generator..."  Unfortunately, This could mean a few things, as well.  For one thing, we don't know if an instance is a single process with multiple threads, or multiple processes AND multiple threads.  This could imply that at any given moment in a raid, you could either have one or many PRNGs affecting the outcome of your actions.<br>
<br>
Edit:  We also do not know if a soft-reset of an instance creates a new process or not.  I would assume that any instance with no players inside would be suspended for a while, and then it's state archive and the process terminated after a half-hour (hence soft-reset time of a half-hour).  If the process it terminated after a certain length of time, when the instance is reopened (entered by a player), the server would have to create a new process for this instance, and load the state from it's cache to repopulate the instance.  If it indeed does create a new process to do this, the assumption would be that a fresh RNG is created.<br>
<br>
How much information is cached is applicable to the first point:  Perhaps only the state of bosses is saved, meaning that a soft-reset could actually create an entirely new loot table for every remaining boss/creature in the instance.  Signs may actually point to this:  Take an instance that crashes just after a player loots a mob.  The player knows the loot that was on that mob, but when he loads back in, the instance has soft-reset (or even just partially rolled back).  Upon killing that mob again, the mob drops something else.  There could be special cases for bosses, but this could also be verified on a bosskill/reset before loot distribution, followed by a rekill of the boss with a different loot set.<br>
<br>
Just my thoughts.  I really enjoy the math things, and considering I used to play with this sort of thing back in my D2 days, it brings back good memories <!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
Picture is grainy, but it gets the job done.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
As far as the direction in which the bulk of this thread is concerned, until patch 2.4 GUIDs were always present yet hidden from view as far as the fundamental structuring of WoW is concerned, or at least I would imagine they certainly have. I really can't see Blizzard changing the structuring of how NPCs are spawned and allocated in patch 2.4 and I think it is fairly safe to assume that WoW NPCs have always been spawned and organized in this manner, the same is true for non-visible raid IDs (pre-1.8 or 1.9). <br>
<br>
The reasoning behind the 'revealing' of identifiable Unit IDs is probably strictly for the user end for meter addons, so the default UI could find units for the new combat log (seeing as the default UI is effectively an addon), or some other mythical dragon-slaying related reason we may not really see until future patches.<br>
<br>
That being said, a correlation between the GUID and the loot table is probably all horse-hockey. Barring an extremely large conclusive sample (running WC 5000 times, for example) I would be fairly certain that the information server-side relevant to loot is simply not available to the user. Even if conclusive data were discovered linking the two, that information would only be useful for the instance/encounter in which it is gathered until a related algorithm is discovered.<br>
<br>
<br>
I really hate getting on the random loot is random bandwagon, but in regards to GUID-loot relationships or even probing the server for relevant loot data, I think the theory is way off-base. All bosses which have a despawning mechanism would easily subvert the pre-determination of loot, all bosses who's loot tables become available mid-attempt probably won't be reset on a hunch, and any variable in loot which can be skewed (be it the items already existing on server or the appearance of one mid-attempt) will result in inconclusive information.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_700562"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I think there's some miscommunication about what is meant by "when the instance is created." My understanding is, instance creation happens again every soft reset, but when the instance is created it's completely filled out with mobs. This is in opposition to it mobs being persistent through soft resets via raidID, which is what you two (dragosal and anedris) are talking about. It is also in opposition to mobs being created dynamically when you get within draw range, which is the main point. The open question is about 'events' where the boss spawns upon some activated event rather than being a persistent mob--do they actually spawn, or do they simply become visible?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Hmm.. about Kael'thas, shouldn't he (and Lady Vashj) be spawned on create now? I haven't been inside either TK or SSC though but the patch notes said you could do Vashj and Kael without killing all the other bosses, which should mean they are there from the start?<br>

And also, not that it really matters. For all we know they are there on create, but moved to a black void or otherwise hidden from us until we trigger something that makes them appear.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>The reasons I state it up with the "things we know" is that there's a blue post that actually says that, in some detail.  Drysc <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080410051509/http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=4311143050&amp;pageNo=5&amp;sid=1#84" target="_blank">posted here</a>.  He does use the language "I believe," however, so it may still be speculation.<br>
<br>
Not that it really matters, as it's something that's completely out of the control of the player to influence, whatever the case.  Even if you knew exactly what seeded the PRNG, and could somehow influence the initialization of it to the exact value you wanted--or could know the exact series of values that would come from the PRNG given a known seed--there are still too many variables to know your loot.<br>
<br>
The best approach to cherrypicking loot is to not force the system to give you what you want, but to reset the system until it does.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Considering I'm hearing that the first gate opened yesterday, would it not be a prime opportunity to test these theories out?<br>
<br>
I suppose this would be heavily dependant on whether or not you can see if the Twins are up when you zone in (or within a reasonable sneaking distance).  If that is indeed possible, now would be the best time to start reset/linktesting.  The following is a possible test:<br>
<br>
<br>
0)  Start by finding out all items that are linkable from the Twins' drop table, and conversly, all that are not.<br>
1)  Pair people up, and have them zone into a fresh instance, one pair at a time.<br>
2)  As each pair goes in, have one go up to the point where they can get a target lock on either of the Twins.  At this point, begin to test all the unlinkable items.<br>
3)  After all items have been confirmed as linkable/non-linkable (the second person is idling in the instance to hold it through disconnects), this pair's job is complete.<br>
4)  Repeat steps 2-4 for the next pair.  Hopefully perform this with a relatively-large sample size, as in 20-30 pairs.  Alternatively, you could test this with fewer pairs, making use of soft-resets to reset the whole instance.  You would need some sort of indicator that you've successfully reset the instance, however, to verify this.<br>
<br>
I'm assuming that many of the items are already linkable, because they can be traded in for something different.  This, unfortunately, makes the job much harder, as it's possible to do this test 100 times, and even IF the theory is correct, not see any proof/disproof of it because the items on the loot table always end up being the items that are already linkable.<br>
<br>
Just throwing this out there, I'm sure there are other theories and test that could be validated with an opportunity like this.<br>
<br>
Have at it, and don't like this opportunity go to waste!  We probably won't get another like it until WotLK.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Then one can at least attempt to verify whether or not the respawning of a boss has any affect on it's linkable loot table at all.<br>
<br>
I'd say that with the amount of guilds that are attempting them, we could at least gather in a little bit of data on this.  If no change is apparent across many (note: subjective) trials, we can conclude that the respawning of a boss has no effect on it's <i>visible</i> loot table.<br>
<br>
[E] Unfortunately, if no change is apparent, it neither proves nor disproves that loot is <i>generated</i> upon boss spawn.  <br>
<br>
However!  If linkable loot <i>does</i> change, the implication is that not only is loot determined on boss spawn, it is also actually generated upon boss spawn, <i>and</i> that respawning a boss does in fact regenerate it's loot table.<br>

[E2]  I'm going to go out on a limb and speculate that resetting a boss does in fact regenerate it's loot table.  I have nothing to prove this with, but circumstantial evidence points to this being the case.  See the above references to killing a boss multiple times in one reset, and receiving different loot.  The only thing that makes me question this is that there's a very good possibility that <i>killing</i> a boss is an entirely different chain of programmatic events than merely resetting it, beyond the obvious, of course.  That is to say, respawning a boss may or may not delete the existing mob structure, before creating a new one, whereas killing a boss most likely does.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Not sure if this has been said before but this is wrong! Im not sure about the exact drop rate so ill call that X% for now. The first time your raid zones into BT after a reset the loot table is created automatically by the server, hence the glaives have an X% chance of being there when you kill Illidan, THIS DOES NOT STACK! The next reset does not make the % chance of a glaive any higher, it will always be X% every reset, this is why guilds who have downed Illidan 50+ times have still not gotten any, it is always a fixed % chance, there is no mulltipliar to increase it.<br>
<br>
So in your example of 15 kills at X% the chance of getting one glaive is still X% at each kill</div>

	</tbody></table>
</div>Erm, you might want to spend a bit time to research cthat. While true what you say for a single instance, you can calculate the probability of n-iterations of a 5% chance to happen (or not happen). For example, if you have a 0.95 (95%) chance of <i>not</i> getting a warglaive, then 15 times not getting a warglaive is 0.95^15 = 0.4633 = 46.33% so quite probable. That is what Antiarc wrote.<br>

</div>Care to explain ? It's an event with a base probability of 5% (assumed) each week/iteration. It's independent of the former week so one can easily do calculations of n-runs. I'm pretty sure Antiarc got it basically right, even though I didn't go and calculated it myself to verify.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">The warglaives are in their own loot table, with about a 5% drop chance. In 15 kills, the chances of getting 1 warglaive is about 46%. The chances of 2 warglaives is 21%, 3 is 9%, 4 is 4.6%, 5 is 2.1%, and 6 is 0.98%.<br>
<br>
Since there are more than 102 guilds killing Illidan, statistically speaking, it's perfectly expected that one of them got 6 warglaives in 15 kills.</div>

</div>Sorry about the math necromancy but I was just checking the numbers since it was mentioned a couple posts ago today.  Assuming that the drop of a warglaive is a 5% chance independent event and 15 Illidan kills, I make it to be:<br>
<br>
0 glaives - 46.33%<br>
1 glaive - 36.58%<br>
2 glaives - 13.48%<br>
3 glaives - 3.07%<br>
4 glaives - 0.49%<br>
5 glaives - 0.056%<br>
6 glaives - 0.0049%<br>
<br>
I bring this up is because it's no longer "perfectly expected" that one of 102 guilds killing Illidan would get 6 warglaives in 15 kills.  If you add up my numbers (assuming they're right!), you'll find that the chances of a guild getting even 4 or more warglaives in 15 kills is about 0.54%.  The calculation I used (where X is the number of glaives):<br>
<br>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080430145238im_/http://elitistjerks.com/cgi-bin/mathtex.cgi?P(X) = (0.95)^X * (0.05)^{(15-X)} * \binom{15}{X}" alt="P(X) = (0.95)^X * (0.05)^{(15-X)} * \binom{15}{X}"><br>
<br>
If you add up Antiarc's numbers and include the 0-warglaive-drop situation (46.33%, confirmed by Cadfael's post immediately above), you end up significantly over 100%.  It looks like the calculation that Antiarc did was P(X) = 0.46 ^ X which I don't think is correct.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_723787"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Setting aside the discussion about the RNG, we can collect all the empirical data we want, but it's not going to help us in getting warglaives. Some guilds get 5 in 10 kills, others get none in 40 kills. Some guilds are just lucky, others are unlucky. <br>
<br>
Thing is, while killing Illidan 40 times is an awful lot, it's still a ridiculously small sample size in the context of statistics. It's actually interesting to run a hypothesis test against a 2,5% criterion (since we're testing one-sided here; I don't think anyone is complaining about getting TOO MANY glaives).<br>
<br>
If we assume the odds of getting either of the warglaives are indeed 5%, one would need to get no warglaives in 72 (SEVENTY-TWO) consecutive kills to be running outside of conventional probabilities. 72 kills is well over a year of killing Illidan weekly and I dont think any guild actually has that many kills under their belt.<br>
<br>
Setting the border of "improbable unluckiness" at 1% would increase this number to 90 by the way.<br>
<br>
So, statistically speaking, nobody can complain about being unlucky when they're not getting glaives. It may be annoying, sure, but all of this is happening within conventional statistical boundaries.<br>
<br>
Interestingly enough, running the test on the other side of the spectrum, shows that getting more than 9 glaives in the same 72 kills is equally unlikely as getting none at all. Now I don't think any guild actually has 10+ glaives, but it'd be interesting to see some high killcount/warglaive ratio's to check if the actual droprate is 5% :-)<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Thank you for your very clever and original response.  All that I'm saying is that, from my experience and people that I've talked to, there has been an unusually high number of Warglaives dropping over the last few weeks, across multiple guilds, on multiple servers.  Could it just be a coincidence?  Certainly.  But it's absolutely possible that the droprate was changed in the last patch as well.  Blizzard's done it before.  Especially with all of the other changes made to allow as many players to experience as much content as possible before the next expansion, it wouldn't surprise me that they would do such a thing.

</div>Actually, the onus is on you to provide proof that the drop-rate of the glaives has been changed.  Just saying "multiple guilds, on multiple servers" have seen them since the patch is no proof at all.  Unless you can get a comprehensive set of data detailing drop rates pre- and post-patch, or a blue post concerning the drop-rate, than from my perspective you're the one trolling the thread with non-facts and assumptions about drop-rates.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>How many guilds are you talking about here?  10? 20? 50?  Across a handful of servers?  Between US and EU servers there are over 2500 guilds that have killed Illidan.  Even if you got statistics from each guild in the world on how many Warglaives they have gotten since 2.4, it would still be too small of a sample size to determine if the drop rate has been increased.  Even with all the kills to date we can't say for 100% certainty that the drop rate is 5%.<br>
<br>
There was a period of 3 weeks on Blackrock, where if you took the total Illidan kills and the number of Warglaives that dropped and determined the drop rate, it was something like 16%.  Over the next 6 weeks it was less then 1%.  I assure you there was no change in drop rate during those 9 weeks.  It's called random loot.<br>

Just saying "multiple guilds, on multiple servers" have seen them since the patch is no proof at all.

		<div id="post_message_724373"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->It's easy to see only the good and not the bad.  While yes, I'm sure lots of guilds have seen what is, to them, an unusually high number of warglaive drops.  But there are numerous numerous guilds killing Illidan every week, and many of those guilds have seen 0 warglaive drops over the past few weeks.  But you dont' hear about those because it's business as usual for those guilds.  It's like this every patch, and it's just a placebo effect.  People think "ohh a patch, wonder if drop rates got buffed".  They get a drop and this lends more credibility to their thought, so they start to believe it.  Then they hear stories from other people also suffering from this placebo effect, and it compounds from there.  <br>
<br>
In any case, I do believe this is just a coincidence.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>This has been noted many times, and even confirmed by a CM, if I recall correctly. It's a very simple tactic to save on server resources.  For instance, how many people do you think hang out where Kazzak used to be (where Kruul is now)?  Given how many mobs are there, you can easily see how much is saved if they're never spawned.  <br>
<br>
In reference to this particular example, this probably means many servers never even spawn the Kruul world boss in a given reset...<br>
<br>

[E2] Perhaps now would be an opportune time to test a spinoff of this experiment:  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080430145238/http://elitistjerks.com/f33/t18193-fishy_experiment/" target="_blank">A fishy experiment</a><!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>
