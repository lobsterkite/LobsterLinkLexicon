		<div id="post_message_455320"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Hello, we are currently doing progress on Illidan and are somewhat stuck on Phase 2. Anytime we got the first flame below 50% it will charge someone in the raid (often the tank who got the other flame). Then it will enrage and start onehitting the tank thus wiping us. We don't have a clue what mechanics are behind this charge, if it's the range between the 2 flames or something else. Someone told us to not cast totems in phase 2, we did so but still had one flame charge a random person.<br>
Can anyone share some information regarding this issue? Thanks.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_455328"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->The flame elementals have a charge with a very large minimum range.  If anything exceeds that range (including the tank of the opposite elemental) it will charge and enrage.  After Enraging it cannot be tanked and will quickly wipe your raid.<br>
<br>
The two tanks for the Flames should stay as close to their warglaive tether as possible, rotating in a small oval to avoid standing in the green fires.  If they pull the Flame too far away, they risk getting the opposite tank charged.<br>
<br>
Edit: I believe the totem mechanic is something completely unrelated to distance.  Even totems in the center of the raid can occasionally be charged.  This is a bug that I hope they can fix.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_455341"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Thanks for the quick reply. That explains why it's always at ~ 50%, because our tanks run a specific pattern and this seems to exceed this range so we should work on this.<br>

As for tanking, there 3 circles. The center circle, the second one, and the outer circle. As long as your adds don't go too far out past the outer circle, you shouldn't have them charging the tank on the other side and enraging.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_455437"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->We've never had an enrage unless we were wiping and people were running away just randomly.  <br>
<br>
Our rule of thumb is:<br>
Both tanks keep their flame INSIDE the inner circle region (the flat banded area that represents a path where the warglaives rest within) - most of the time the tank himself is inside this region as well.  We stressed that they don't pull them far from that outer band.  <br>
<br>
As for the breath - as long as people aren't standing too close to either flame of azzinoth they will not get breathed on even with new totems.  The closer flame for us has always surged totems, and totems haven't been a problem.<br>
<br>
The problem is with a bug where the flames surge to a totem, and breath on their way back, hitting and probably killing anyone in that path.  For this we have people back behind the flame of azzinoth as it surges, and not get too close.  <br>
<br>
I think the surge is really insignificant relative to dodging lasers and having a "path" for reducing blaze damage.  IMO, once your tanks learn those two tricks, you've won the fight.  Unfortunately almost the entirety of the difficulty of this fight is placed on 3 tanks - with all due respect to the healers... by now this isn't that rough for them - it certainly isn't shahraz or even illdari in terms of healing intensity (we bring 8-9 healers since there isn't a single dps race in this fight, and we do phase 4 in usually 2 demons with 1 trap used in total of our last 3 kills - and probably 0 now until they fix these rad bugs I'm hearing about).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

The only uncontrollable thing we've seen that can wipe us after cleaning phase 2 is when he puts 2+ of the banishing eyes of beholder demons on the warlock tank.

</div>We used to have a huge spread with a lot of people backed up and had a lot of trouble with this, but we recently changed our strat for this phase.  We originally thought this was the same proximity range as basically everything else in the game, but the aoe range is really only 5 yards.  We pack almost our entire raid in the front.  Our positioning is a lot tighter, and we don't back up from the boss almost at all, pretty much everyone is in the front of the room, and demons in general got a lot easier to kill, especially on the lock tank.  We also have our lock tank run away when demons are imminent, and just don't dps the boss.  Having the warlock at like 50 yards at this point also makes a huge difference.

		<div id="post_message_455523"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I agree with Hand. Our first kill was actually the first time we saw phase 3 (and beyond), we did get a bit lucky though with demons, thinking back. (Although I was one of the only deaths and that was due to a double parasite + banish instagib [people were pretty bad at parasite management/control then, and I had to be mostly stationary because I was healing the warlock..])<br>
<br>
We had our warlock really, really close to Illidan and if he ever got a demon it probably would have been a wipe, let alone 2. Now we play it safe after having wiped that way once, and after he gets a bit of threat, he moves waaaaaay back, so there's a good 50+ yards between anyone and Illidan.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

We had a flawless p2 this timer and then had our last add tank, with basically all healers on him at the time, go from 100% to 0% in 2.5 seconds despite a paladin landing a 7.5k crit heal during that window and a couple of HoTs ticking.  If you're moving through two overlapping Blazes you're literally taking 10000 damage per second before mitigation, and if you get a couple of bad resists, you're fucked.  In our case it was 6 Blaze ticks, 2 melee hits, and one breath, all in the span of 2.5 seconds.  Fortunately the Flame was at 1% when the tank died so we proceeded normally.

</div>It is frustrating but you simply need to keep pushing through it until your offtanks learn.  Once those two players get it down as well as possible, you'll see Illidan fall over in an hour or so.  <br>
<br>
When a laser is on a tank's side he/she needs to realize it is the ONLY thing that matters.  <br>
<br>
There are three really simple ways to deal with laser (and really only 3 unless you count shield wall):<br>
<br>
1. Do nothing because it isn't going to hit you... keep your rotation going.<br>
2. Backup - you can always backup just enough to avoid by simply moving back.  <br>
3. Run across to the safe side.  <br>
<br>
Always yell on vent the name of the tank whose side it is on - and maybe add "coming right for you" if it is.  <br>
<br>
Also - have your tanks use the command: <br>
/console CameraDistanceMaxFactor 4<br>
<br>
This will let you zoom far enough back that you can easily see lasers coming.  Plus the ground shakes, plus everyone is yelling laser.  <br>
Keep in mind that the further you zoom out, the lower your framerate will be.<br>
<br>
Finally: Avoiding lasers and doing the tanking is IMO relatively simple, but not everyone is going to do well on this task.  It is stressful to have the fate of the raid placed on you - and often times offtanks aren't immediately acclimated to this very real stress.  Take it easy on them when they wipe you - because they will.  Be constructive I guess.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_461059"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I'm pretty sure the way it works is that the blades each have a buff which protects everyone around them (in what people are calling the safe circles) making those people untargetable by the charge.

</div>We try to keep people way at the back but also spread in a reasonable manner, with dpsers on the front row so they can immediately react to the demon spawn. The idea is to keep the demons coming in a parallel line (as much as possible at least) and actually going through the raid, having to travel a great distance to reach their targets, which allows enough time to dps them down.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>What he said, but we have all DPS in front of healers except for the lock healers. We do tend to stack our two hunters near the warlock tanks side to kill demons as they come up. Our setup is ranged DPS is closer than melee DPS which is closer than healers. Melee can move up to the demons in between flame bursts. <br>
<br>
Phase 3 and 4 are fairly easy. In our case, phase 3 and 4 are the still hard depending on how many people freak out and panic when the boss gets closer to death. This week it was 2 hours of phase 2 wipes since we decided we'd like to bunch up to kill ourselves and we let the add tanks die for an hour, followed by another wipe in P3 because everyone lost their brains around 30% and let 2 people die to demons and let parasites go rampant.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Yes so was our plan after the wipe, but in the killtry we decided not to use any traps, because we thought it would cause to much trouble (for Example healrange problems while pulling him) and could wipe us.<br>
But the biggest Problem is Maievs stupid KI. In 4 Kills i´ve seen only one Trap near Illidan, all other traps were placed at a minimum of 20 Yards away.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_462514"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->The only issue with traps are the fact he can use an ability after the trap. That makes me very nervous. The chance of him nailing the raid with draw soul and healing up to who knows what is the one I'm most worried about. First kill he destroyed a DPS warrior, this weeks kill I yelled at the melee to back out just to be sure.  I suppose if you did get aggro and he did cast draw the melee could react and it wont be that much of an issue, but with them not dealing with it normally I know it's going to happen sometime and it's going to hurt. If the first trap was ever in the center of the raid I'd think twice about using it, however it shouldn't be taking you more than 2 traps to kill him so if not the first trap, I'd use the second no matter what. <br>
<br>
As far as the parasites go, usually it's a transition phase that we mess up the parasites. Normal form to demon form when we're spreading out. Then we have the times where our mage stands on top of nova and it starts to go downhill. At least 2 wipes this week due to that stuff.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I wouldn't suggest this but this is what we did.  We had Illidan tanked next to one of the pillars, then we ran back as he went demon.  Then after the initial aoe fire attack (can't recall the name). We had people run back even more and possibly be in range of 2 people, get the demons then move up.  It was really nice having ~100 yards to kill a demon.  Never had any issues killing them.  Our warlock would get aggro and 4-5 sec before the demons also run back.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_463066"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->For us the vast majority of traps are simply inaccessible.  We tank near the right pillar (if you are the raid looking at him toward the wall).  Maybe its a bad spot - but they end up either in the middle of the room, behind the pillar, or completely inaccessible near a wall (without antikiting and probably healing).  <br>
And only had 1 trap that was essentially reachable in roughly 10-15 traps.  <br>
<br>
Moving the boss when a demon is imminent, and a risk of the heal hitting the raid when it is over seems to not make it worth using necessarily.  I'd think you're far more likely to wipe due to illidan being in a bad position - or moving out of healer range - or having the warlock tank be forced too close, than doing double dps for a few seconds, with risks of buggy effects after.  <br>

		<div id="post_message_464302"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Yeah I've tanked through enrages a few times, but yet to be on a kill, usually when I can't get a trap for whatever reason (I've seen some just straight awful drops) something else goes wrong too, but it's easy to live through, I can pop Shadowmoon Insignia and Last Stand and break 30k hp, shield wall a second.  Fortunately, reading this thread reminded me to actually keep aggro through the second trap this week, I died to him hitting me twice and being in a flame patch but it kept him away from the raid at 1% when he cast draw soul =x<br>
<br>
Not getting him trapped usually means someone clicked too early, or the trap was in some shitty place (against the back wall, Illidan's model is too big to make him run the circle to walk against the wall)  I don't think it's possible if you position properly (or at least a lot less likely, haven't seen it since i changed positioning.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>This is exactly right - druids will take more damage, but dish out more aggro.  It is exactly how we do it, and it lets us go all-out and reduce the time on phase 2, or at least the healing required by a lot.  Highly recommend you tank like this if you have the chance.  Plus some warriors just aren't that great at aggro, and in this situation with watching blazes and lasers - you have to blind tank it a lot.  The tank best suited to do this is likely the MT who will not be in FR.  <br>
<br>
Aggro is a very real issue in phase 2 if you want to lust/unload/cd.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Yeah we actually had one of those this week (almost 2)  we lost our warlock tank after the first trap for some reason (I don't think we know) and then lost a few more people while he rezzed up and got aggro back, so when we had him at 4% he came out of the second trap and drained the raid back up to 14%  Third trap he was at 1% and was starting to cast a drain soul on the raid again when he came out but damage got him to the death sequence before he did (so lucky)<br>
<br>
We also had fun when we dropped to transform to demon phase, then dot's pushed him below 30% and he stood back up in normal phase and stunned us while I was way at the back of the room with MD's down, some pro recovery when he came out, went for a totem first on one side of the room, then the warlock who had been building threat on the other side, then we bopped him and he went for a shadow priest on the other side and my shield slam didn't miss so I got him, woo.  It seems like the 30% while he's in a changing animation bugging him is fixed, either that or we got damn lucky and moved him sub 30 just in time and if it was 2 seconds later and he'd transformed we'd have gotten wrecled.<br>
<br>
All in all between that, losing the warlock tank, and almost 2 soul drains on the raid, I was very happy with a 1 shot =x  The encounter seems to have a lot of things that can be screwed up, but usually it's your own fault and not too bad to recover from (hell i even got sheared twice, first shear and one right as he enraged, but I had already walled since i was slow to get to the trap).  I've gotta say I really like the fight.<br>
<br>
We also use 1 druid and 1 warrior to tank the flames, but that's partly out of necessity, we lost some tanks and ended up going to Illidan with 2 warriors and 1 feral druid as our only tanks in guild, so really didn't have a choice, it does work out very well though.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">This is exactly right - druids will take more damage, but dish out more aggro.  It is exactly how we do it, and it lets us go all-out and reduce the time on phase 2, or at least the healing required by a lot.  Highly recommend you tank like this if you have the chance.  Plus some warriors just aren't that great at aggro, and in this situation with watching blazes and lasers - you have to blind tank it a lot.  The tank best suited to do this is likely the MT who will not be in FR.  <br>

Aggro is a very real issue in phase 2 if you want to lust/unload/cd.</div>

Other than the totem bugs and strange charge mechanics, I like the fight. The one time we got to phase 3 we wiped because our warlock tank had nether prot.

</div>There's two types of charges, but they aren't like what you stated. The first type of charge is when any player/pet is outside of the green zone (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080410191454/http://img209.imageshack.us/img209/714/illidanhg0.jpg" target="_blank">pic on first page</a>).  The second type of charge occurs when someone/thing is resurrected, summoned, or planted (totems). This type of charge will disregard the green zone. With both types, if the Flame is too far away from it's blade after the charge, it will enrage.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Huh??? That would completely trivialize the P2 positioning mechanics at play, very interesting if this is true.  I think more likely what is happening is the blue flame is just despawning like it does after 1 minute?  Although, that would be nice if it was intended... something for the Illidan tank to do in P2 besides running around bandaging people!<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Confirmed.  I've been doing this for a few weeks and hinted about it in previous posts.  You actually spell reflect the demon fire (blue flame) damage back onto an invisible NPC that will then die in a couple seconds.  The patches die in individual small squares (maybe 3x3 yards).<br>
<br>
However, even without spell reflect, the demon fire is a trivial increase in damage compared to blaze and Flames of Azinoth.  The greatest benefit of doing this is squelching the blue flames so that melee DPS have an easier time staying in range.  Again, this is even less important when you consider that Omen is buggy in P2 and DPS needs to be somewhat conservative to avoid pulling aggro.<br>
<br>
This definitely makes life easier, but it doesn't trivialize P2 by any means.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Yeah, like you mentioned, warrior as well as shadowpriest aggro is inflated.  Also, a hunter in our guild had some experience with FD bugs.  He would FD and not get a resist message, so both he and omen thought it was a threat wipe.

</div>I believe this has already been discussed in another thread somewhere on these forums.  There is a post by Dukes (feral druid) which is near the beginning of the discussion.  Hopefully that helps (aka good luck finding it).  <br>

		<div id="post_message_469768"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Honestly. I thought the druid setup that was posted for FR gear was solid.<br>
<br>
I told one of the OTs to follow the FR warrior setup that was posted by the guy in D&amp;T I believe. He followed it. It took awhile to get everything setup correctly. In the end our feral druid wasn't there so I ended up as the 2nd OT.<br>
<br>
I came up with a much easier solution then what was posted. Just remember I am the main tank so the gear I have/can have. The other OTs may/may not have.<br>
<br>
It's all very easy to get imo. <br>
<br>
Destroyer Greathelm - Dodge and Defense Enchant<br>
Amulet of the tornheart - 24FR<br>
Destroyer Shoulderguards - Dodge and Defense Enchant - I'm Aldor<br>
Wyrmcultist's Cloak - 24FR +15FR enchant<br>
Inferno Tempered Chestguard 60FR - 150hp enchant<br>
Eternium Shell Bracers<br>
Inferno Tempered Gauntlets - 40FR +8FR enchant<br>
Girdle of the Invulnerable - Gems 12stam 10Defense -- Needed epic defense gem to cap defense.<br>
Inferno Tempered Leggings - 55FR - 40stam 12agil enchant <br>
Inferno Tempered Boots - 45FR - Boar's speed enchant<br>
Phoenix-Fire Band - 30FR<br>
Ring of Sundered Souls<br>
Adamantite Figurine<br>
Scarab of Displacement<br>
The Unbreakable Will<br>
Aldori Legacy Defender<br>
Rifle of the Stoic Guardian<br>
<br>
301FR 486 Defense. Use a flask of fort. Bam 490 capped.<br>
19.22% dodge<br>
16.67% parry<br>
13,544hp<br>
<br>
Some items are changeable as you could use a higher defense ring then the Sundered Souls and you could use a +defense green bow.<br>
So you would end up with less dodge but capping defense is a must. Otherwise you will get crit for 12k or so.<br>
Losing dodge isn't a huge deal. Even staying in the blazes a bit longer so your melee dps can dps longer isn't a big deal once you learn the fight.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_479007"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Sorry for reviving an old thread but my guild has been stuck on phase 2 for 2 nights of attempts and making slow progress. I was wondering how many healers did you guys bring on your first kill because we're trying it with 9. We're having a semi-difficult time keeping up the 2 Azzinoth tanks but become completely overwhelmed when barrage comes. We position ourselves on the circle with 4 groups from north, south, west, and east. Maybe I'm exaggerating and it takes time for healers to get use to it. The best attempt we had tonight was having 1 flame down with 3-4 deaths and then barrage came :/<br>
<br>
When the first flame die, we would make the range switch to the other side but we're still having  problems keeping people up with all the damage going on<br>

		<div id="post_message_479012"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->We've done it with 8 and 9. Regardless, we'll have 3 shamans raid healing. The 9th healer just assists on tanks and some spot healing in the raid; its usually a second holy priest. <br>
<br>
We use the same 4 corners as you do. Basically, when barrage comes hes not dropping fireballs on the raid. So all 3 shamans heal the barrage plus the extra healer if we have him. <br>
<br>
I know our shamans also run an NS rotation for each barrage, just to make sure a big heal lands. Also if you have 3 of each paladins, mages, and rogues, you basically have 3 freebies (assuming all mages are frost).<br>
<br>
As a healer, my only complaint about the barrage is that grid and perfect raid don't highlight the targeted person as "having aggro" before barrage is cast.

		<div id="post_message_479035"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->If your tanks are taking more damage from Blaze than they are from melee, then they need to fix that.  Blaze is going to hurt them -- that's inevitable.  But what kills tanks is Blaze, not the elementals.  If you stand in two overlapping Blaze patches, full FR or not, you will absolutely melt.  I've seen 28k damage in just over 3 seconds from Blaze + melee + breath, and it was the tank's fault for moving through existing fires.<br>
<br>
Tree druids are pretty godly for p2 Illidan tank healing.  In my experience one tree rolling two sets of HoTs on the tanks, plus one paladin full-time on each tank, plus an extra healer splitting his attention between the two tanks, should be enough for them.  That leaves 3-4 people to heal the raid.  That said, I prefer 9 healers for Illidan just because we're never going to wipe for lack of DPS, but extra healing makes the whole thing very stable.<br>
<br>
Also I'm a bit confused by how Barrage in particular is causing problems.  For me Barrage is a good thing, because it means he stops fireballing for a bit and people will get VE healing, and a couple of spare heals while the Barrage is ongoing, letting us catch back up if he's done a few bad fireballs in a row on the same people.  Have someone (we have our Illidan MT do this since it's not like we need sick prot DPS during this part) watch Illidan's movements, both to call out where the next Beam is going to be, but also to call out when he's beginning a Barrage.  You can see him prepare the spell visually right before it starts damaging someone.  If all your healers are ready for it when it comes, there's really no way it should cause deaths.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Sorry for reviving an old thread but my guild has been stuck on phase 2 for 2 nights of attempts and making slow progress. I was wondering how many healers did you guys bring on your first kill because we're trying it with 9. We're having a semi-difficult time keeping up the 2 Azzinoth tanks but become completely overwhelmed when barrage comes. We position ourselves on the circle with 4 groups from north, south, west, and east. Maybe I'm exaggerating and it takes time for healers to get use to it. The best attempt we had tonight was having 1 flame down with 3-4 deaths and then barrage came :/<br>
<br>
When the first flame die, we would make the range switch to the other side but we're still having  problems keeping people up with all the damage going on<br>

</div>I'm not sure why you'd fall behind when the dark barrage comes, I'm sure it's less raid damage than the fireballs. Just have an NS rotation set up, and if you're still having problems keeping the dark barraged player, use a shadow cauldron. We learned the fight with 8 healers and usually bring 8. We don't have any assigned positions, people just kind of spread - the fireballs target random spots on the floor, much like the AOE on council, and hence any clumping will not actually increase the damage to an area. It can be pretty random. We pass out fire prot pots and people are expected to save their pot cooldowns for them, except for healers. I keep an eye on the raid's health level and try to give a warning to use cooldowns if the raid starts getting hit particularly hard. We only have two resto shamans for the fight, having more would make it easier. We have two healers on each flame tank, and then the two resto shamans and two leftover healers on the raid.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
I found that BigWigs alone was not fast enough for me to target the Barrage target and heal them quickly.  In other words, as someone already mentioned, since you don't get an aggro warning on the person who's going to get Dark Barrage before he casts it, I'd have to look on BigWigs to see who was getting it, then find that person in Grid and try to target them quickly and start heals.  If I just waited to see who was getting damage, most times it was already too late.<br>
<br>
What we did that made a world of difference was had all the healers add "Dark Barrage" to Grid to see who's getting the debuff.  It's under Status-&gt;Auras-&gt;Add new Debuff or something like that.  That way you see immediately who has the debuff and toss heals.  If you get on top of it immediately, it's absolutely no problem to heal through with just one or two healers.<br>
<br>
For us, we have 2 pallies on one tank and 1 pally 1 priest on the other tank.  The 2 druids are always keeping HoTs up, and then the rest of the healers (usually 8-9 total, and the rest are shaman) heal the raid (+ shadow priests to keep everyone topped off).  On Dark Barrage, the pallies will toss a Holy Shock before returning to their target, and shamans will take care of the healing.<br>
<br>
<br>
As a side note, adding Parasites (Parasitic Shadowfiend) and Agonizing Flames to Grid helped a ton for P3/P4, too.<br>
<br>
As I said, it may be obvious for some, but when we finally did it (after an hour or two of attempts), it made such a difference in the ease of healing.<br>
<br>
I can't think of many other bosses that have a debuff like that where it's not immediately obvious who's getting it (from aggro warning or someone taking damage when they shouldn't be) without having the debuff show in Grid.<br>
<br>
*edit* Forgot to add this in originally...<br>
<br>
For positioning, we do 3 camps in a row from front to back (two edge groups are just barely on that lip between the grate and the ring surrounding the grate and the third group is exactly in the middle).  Then, the melee are on either side, depending on which Flame they're meleeing.  The 3 groups never get hit with eye beams or flames, so they don't have to worry about ever moving, and more than one group should never get hit with fireballs at the same time (people really have to stack, though).  I also rarely if ever have problems reaching either tank from any of the three spots (I think once or twice I've had to move a bit for a moment to stay with a tank, but was able to move back quickly).<br>
<br>
We found it worked well for us, since we're pretty awful at spreading out, sometimes.  You can get a bit unlucky sometimes and have one group get hit with lots of fireballs over and over, but with shadow priests, shamans, and consumables, we can usually do alright.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I'd propose that tanks are doing a good job if they take 1/3 as much Blaze damage as they do Flame of Azzinoth damage.  If they're taking 1/2 as much, it is managable but performance could be improved.  If it's more than 1/2 additional damage then you have a problem.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>This is something I do for every fight because of what you said, it is a night and day difference in being able to heal that person asap. I also use the aggro alert feature Grid has once I am comfortable with the fight because I know what the aggro alert is telling me ("Hey he is going to get the parasitic shadowfiend" etc). It let's you be proactive rather than reactive.<br>
<br>
++<br>
<br>
We just spread out dynamically for the most part. I try and bring the same people every week with 1-2 new people so they can experience the fight. So people already have a general idea of where they like to stand.<br>
<br>
Healingwise it is usually 2 Paladins on our Feral OT and myself and a Tree on our second tank (Warrior). That leaves 5 healers for the raid as I bring 9 healers from Mother -&gt; Illidan. <br>
<br>
I think I am going to have our shams Earthshield me as I am the aura bitch and do get knockbacked quite a bit. I haven't let a tank die yet because of it, but I cheat and have 4 pc tier 5. Once I break it I can see it possibly hurting us one night.<br>
<br>
We had an app OT the flames this Thursday and he was a gnome. If you have a gnome make sure that they have a deviate because he los'd me due to his size and the shape of the middle ring. That wasn't the only issue I had healing him (mainly player errors as far as going too far out etc), but it might save some people a wipe.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I guess we've just never found the fireball damage to be overwhelming at that point (after the first elemental is down).  That seems strange people with more shaman would find the fireball damage difficult to keep up with.  We only have 1 resto shaman in the guild and always bring 8 healers to Illidan.  Perhaps people aren't utilizing the extra spread out area after the first flame dies?  You really get a LOT of extra room back behind the first blade after you down the first elemental so overall damage to the raid has already decreased a ton.  Sure I guess people standing in the back area need to be careful for eye beam but as long as the smarter people utilize that area it should be ok.<br>
<br>
I agree though, barrage is less overall healing.  In our experiences, however, we just had a lot bigger issue with people dying to barrage than fireball so we'd rather he goes back to fireballing us.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_479899"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->One other thing I didn't think of earlier on using shamans to heal that fight is the effect of pushback. The paladins are likely going to be running fire aura for the tanks rather than concentration, so using a 2.5 sec cast (chain heal) to raid heal is going to see a lot of pushback, depending on where your earth shields are. I even notice it a bit on tank healing. CoH and hots don't suffer from that.<br>
<br>

<br>
The 2 tanks follow the red arrow route in a parallel way to prevent charge and enrage from the Flames. Raid splits up into 5 groups with each 3-4 ppl in. Green lines shows the the direction the group should collapse towards if Eye Blasts were coming their way. In the start we followed this to the exact point but now we just use it more as a guideline and have healers in the middle. 2 healers on each tank (some would advise 3 on each) and rest on raid. We take 8-9 healers with us for this fight.<br>
<br>
We have a druid rotation ready to use a tranquility just a couple of secs before a possible Barrage each time.<br>
<br>
And adding Dark Barrage to your Grid is an awesome idea as someone has already posted <br>
<br>
The thing about totems in phase 2 is just ridiculous and I hope Blizzard will fix this. Also crap with not being able to res/ankh (even a pet) in p2 or a Flame will charge and enrage is stupid.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>We do the same and it's never seemed to be an issue with healing, our deaths in that phase are either if one of the tanks messes up moving and we get an enrage, or sometimes one or two people die to stepping in blaze or eye beam, or someone gimps up healing once in a while, or somebody decides to be an asshat and pulls aggro (happened on our kill this week, had like 4 dead after the flames died, though we crezzed 3) I think spreading out so you can heal through the phase is all that really matters.<br>
<br>
Though I never would have tried spreading the groups out that far, I'm pretty sure someone would space out and get killed by the eye beam, and while it probably wouldn't happen to people a lot, i'm sure at least one person would die every week.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>We do too, but we've never seen an enrage.  I figure we're not going to break what works.  Edgewalker tanked one side once and was WAY further back than we normally tank the adds.  I suppose we could spread out more, but we preposition anyway so it cuts damage down to something quite manageable.  The lasers really dictate your position a lot of time anyway - and even inside the grating you have to adjust to them... I wouldn't want more people ran over.  <br>
<br>
Plus if you're off by a little bit, you get that potential enrage surge (unless this was hotfixed for tank to tank).  <br>
<br>
What I don't get is you mentioning you have to stand near the warglaive just to heal your own tank.  That is incredibly far out - the lasers don't even get remotely close to the position you're talking about your tank being at.  Healing range covers the entire circle diameter - much less from the center going outwards.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
We haven't seen enrages from the elementals since we learned the fight. It seems the tanks can go nearly as far directly out from the blade as they can to the left and right of it, which would be the more normal path.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_480292"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->We are stuck in P2. If everything goes well, we reach P3, but it its too random for my taste.<br>
<br>
I just don't understand how those Flames of Azzinoth exactly work.<br>
<br>
Things we (mostly involuntarily) tested:<br>
*Flames enrage, if they are too far away from their Warglaive (they lose the green ray)<br>
*They charge everything, that "comes to life" - Totems, Pet &amp; Battlerezzes<br>
*The charge won't cause their enrage. But mostly they charge too far away from their warglaive and therefore they enrage<br>
<br>
But i just won't get, why they charge some players. We did read the 40y distance thing, but this just doesn't seem right. <br>
I could swear, sometimes our Tank moves more than 40y away and nothing happens.<br>
One try later both tanks are about 20y away from each other and one of them gets charged...<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I stand in the middle (as much as possible) of the two tanks in order to provide them both with an aura.  There is always a chance that at one point one tank will be missing the aura, but that rarely is the cause of a tank death.  Our biggest problem is still dealing with barrage and people dying; I think this past week we had two people die to barrage but they were battle-rezzed at the start of the next phase.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">The only time we have ever seen an enrage was when a player DC'd just before a phase change.

</div>Spreading out reduces damage to the raid, which can matter depending on how much raid healing you have available. The beams always go in the same four paths, and if people can't pan their cameras around to see which it is when there are plenty of warnings, well, I don't know what to say. Which positioning will be better for a raid depends on what the most likely cause of death is.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

My best suggestion is to call the corner it starts from, NE SW and so, and the target.  That will usually provide you with the info you need to dodge if it comes quick.  The problem is that the beams deviate a bit, so there is never a guaranteed safespot, and sometimes he'll start a beam way too close to dodge.<br>

		<div id="post_message_481436"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->The beams always go through the middle ring, 50% continuously pass through it while 2x 25% are placed on the outer ring (I hope this was verbalized understandable). We kinda defined the "middle ring" as a "danger zone", where you don't want to spend much time tanking the elemental. Thus I try to tank the flames mostly on the outer ring, usually I kite them there in a half circle, placing the flame patches as close to each other as possible. <br>
When I reach the end of the "safe zone", I turn around, run through the middle ring, placing max 1 flame patch there, and start the kiting route on the outer ring again. If done right, the flame patches from the last round just vanish when you approach the next round and you safely can watch the blue beam pass by in the middle ring while tanking the flame on the outer ring.<br>
<br>
The only "oh shit" moment happens, when the beam spawns directly behind you on the outer ring, then you have to be either quick changing position to the middle ring, or sit it out in a flame patch with SW.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

This is where four possible beams come from but there are many, many more angles for them to take.<br>
<br>
From our experiences the beams can spawn anywhere along the north or south axis.  If they spawn on the east half they go east, if they spawn on the west half, they go west.  The beams then always create a tangent to the circle from where they spawn.<br>
<br>
Do it enough times and you'll see some angles you didn't think could happen and your "Safe spots" aren't so safe anymore!<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>My only criticism is that you make reference, or at least imply that your position relative to the other tank is even remotely important, when it is in fact not.  Only your position relative to the blade on the ground matters.<br>
<br>
Other than that really good video mostly because its a pretty slow phase 2 (compared to use at least, usually have 1 ele down in 1 minute) so it shows some really nice control.  Not sure if you did voice over after the fraps or not, but staying as calm as you were is really important for tanks to do, just keep cool and all will be well.<br>
<br>
Side note, I found out last night one thing that causes charges that people should be aware of.  Since i'm the Illidan tank I don't have a whole lot to do in phase 2 besides clean up the blue beams and make other calls.  For people who haven't figured it out, each blade has a separate aura that pulses on an interval.  When you lose the aura you are not immune to charge, you otherwise are.  So what I noticed is that if you quickly switch from 1 side to the other it is possible to lose aura before the other blade applies you a new one, thus making the elemental charge you.  So, if you are going to switch sides it is reccomended that you go slowly, or stand in the overlapped aura area for 1-2 seconds before you do it.  This is very reproducible with intercept/intervene from 1 side to the other.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Actually, they will charge if a player is too far away from them (thats how blizzard keeps raiders inside grating and thus susceptible to the beams and splash fireball damage).  Maybe in the video i wasn't clear about this, but what i meant was that you want to make sure you dont go too far away from the other flame or it will charge.  I haven't seen much evidence that there's a pulse effect other than just pulling them (the flame) too far from the blade.  Also, this doesn't offer much explanation as to the two different types of charge that they do.<br>
<br>
If you watch the really old last resort video you can watch kerp standing in what the diagrams on this forum would call a "bad zone" the entire phase.  Only after the opposite flame is pulled to the farthest end does he get charged and only once, which suggests to me that it something to do with the raiders distance from the flames as well as the flames distance from the blade.<br>
<br>
Either way, you want to keep your path about like the video as we haven't had any issues since our first kill<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Definitely.  I'm just saying if you are going to take the risk of trying it out you might as well try to keep them from enraging in the process...  Of course we're only talking about 10 minutes and 1 wipe to figure this out anyway so it isn't a big deal.<br>

</div>I'm a bit skeptical on this, we've only had 1 week where we changed in demon form, that was a mistake and yeah, he killed like 3 people.  Usually it's no problem for him to stay on me, however this week there was a parasite sitting direcly on Illidan, so when I was spam clicking and hitting shield slam it targeted the parasite and Illidan ran off and killed someone, and started running at someone else before I went over and picked him up.  It's possible that some DOT's were running or something (cause I forget who he killed) but it seems unlikely that it would only happen this one time, and when I didn't get to hit Illidan.  And personally, I'd rather not risk a wipe to test it again =x<br>

I also don't think he has a threat table (or at least hasn't reset it) until some specific point in the laying down thing.  I've spaced out for a second and beaten on him for 5 seconds or so before realizing he was going demon and not had aggro, and I've thrown myself at him while he's laying down going human and had him go to our shadow tank.  I can't be 100% sure on where the swap is during the animation but our warlocks seem to be fine just spamming searing pain and I've been fine sundering while he's down and dropping a big SS/HS in him just before he starts moving again/having a target.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I should have been more specific that I meant the transition between his human to his demon form (and opposite) before hitting 30%. It seems likely that he resets his aggro right as he lies down on the ground. Also, looking at WWS confirms that our destruction warlock got a ~7k SB crit while he was lying on the ground, and promptly got aggro and wiped halfed the raid.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>We've made it a habit to call out for DPS to stop prior to Phase 3/4/5 transitions, and it helped a good amount in regards to transitioning, we've had people pull aggro during a transition even with a misdirect up. In general, a good policy is to emphasize to your raid that similiar to Archimonde, DPS is not a concern, and it's imperative that you relax on damage during transitions.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Ideally, you should do this. If you can't then two person will get the parasite, making the transition a bit more hectic. Also, don't forget to apply Mortal Strike or Wounding Poison while waiting.

</div>The parasites die incredibly quickly to an instant or near instant AOE.  For us, Multi-shot works really well, with other nearby dps tossing instants if needed based on positioning once we get near the end.<br>
<br>
We typically run 3 hunters for Illidan, 2 of which are ready to multishot any parasites every time they're up, and me as a third doing the same but sometimes being out of range when I'm dropping a frost trap under Illidan as he's hunched over going into demon phases.  As long as we communicate to our mages if we think we'll need help we don't have any issues.<br>
<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Hi<br>
Just another small question<br>
How do you deal with the parasites on the final transition at 30 % ?<br>
do you have some kind of burst dps at a given time for the last % once parasites pop off the targeted player ?</div>

	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>If there are parasites ticking at the 30% mark, here is what we do:<br>
- Mark both parasites with raid icons to help people identify them<br>
- Use all stuns (HOJ, Conc blow) and ranged DPS to burn them down<br>
- If the parasite spreads, the infected go to our designated spot (usually the center of the grid).   It doesn't really matter if 1, 2, or 3 people get this here, since we AOE them as they spawn.  Then we're caught up and back to normal.<br>
<br>
(E) That aside, I think it's pretty stupid that you have to deal with parasites running amok during the 30% scripted sequence.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_495735"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Our guild got two solid nights in on Illidan this week.<br>
<br>
The first night we got into p3 a couple times at the end (although it was very sloppy) and the second night wasn't so good.<br>
<br>
Anyway, my question is, how hard do you have to push the dps in p2 when expecting to get your first kill? What's an acceptable amount of time to spend in p2? <br>
<br>
With our recent trend of melee stacked raids it seems that we are at a disadvantage with 'unlucky' eye beams/blaze preventing melee from attacking for long periods of time. It seems that within 2 rotations of a tank (back and forth once) we can get it to 60% (which seems awfully slow), although we were able to tear into it more with BL and pushing harder on our first night, but people routinely pulled.<br>
<br>
Should we look at p2 like archimonde and it's all about survival? Or will that drain the healers dry?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_495745"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->P2 is definitely a dps race. I remember, during our first tries and our first kill, everyone was oom after p2 but p3/4 are all about survival so it's not a problem to use, say, 90% of your mana to get to p3 since you will have plenty of time to regen after.<br>
I don't know how long takes our phase 2, melees dps only the first flame, we just burn the first one as fast as possible with 2 MDs and all bloodlust, it dies fast. Once the first is dead, you have 2-3 more healers for the raid so it's really easier and you can sustain much longer.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_495833"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Completely agree.  Phase 2 the DPS burn is solely on the first elemental.  Once the first elemental dies you can sustain phase 2 indefinitely.  A good goal for the first elemental dying is probably around 80-90 seconds, which should be just after the first barrage.<br>

Comparing that to your druid on your longest attempt (~5.4mil damage) and he took almost double that. Either your p2 is lasting a lot longer, or your druid is doing something wrong. On that attempt your warrior took 129, which is fine I think (at least for that attempt). Comparing it with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080410113139/http://wowwebstats.com/luhkktav2ke25?s=3989-5228&amp;a=0" target="_blank">this Illidan</a> which is from quite a while ago, but I know I got _all_ the eye beams on my side on, shows that even then I took ~290 total ticks of fire (and our other FR tank - Qruz -  took ~100). What may help is making sure they are using the max-zoom command which allows a much better overview of the area (I think it's /console SET "cameraDistanceMax" 250 but I'm not certain).<br>

The best way to judge an Illidan Flame tank's performance is by comparing the ratio of damage from "Flames of Azzinoth" melee to "Blaze", the green fire.  After judging my own performance, I consider a ratio of 4:1 to be "great", 3:1 is "good", and 2:1 is "not good" (but acceptable on a single attempt if you have bad luck with eye beams).<br>
<br>
Norfin is doing a good job.  Across all attempts, Norfin took 2.88 million damage from Flames of Azzinoth melee and .74 million damage from Blaze.  This is a ratio of 3.9:1.  <br>
<br>
Aurica needs improvement.  Across all attempts, Aurica took 2.23 million damage from Flames of Azzinoth melee and 1.03 million damage from Blaze.  This is a ration of 2.16:1.<br>
<br>
I would talk to Aurica and see what he is doing different compared to Norfin.  Make sure that Aurica is not standing in Blaze to make things easier on the melee.  An extra few seconds of melee DPS is not worth risking a tank death, especially when the healing burden in P2 is already very high.  Until Aurica's performance improves, I would also encourage you to focus on killing Aurica's flame first.<br>

An extra few seconds of melee DPS is not worth risking a tank death, especially when the healing burden in P2 is already very high.

The best way to judge an Illidan Flame tank's performance is by comparing the ratio of damage from "Flames of Azzinoth" melee to "Blaze", the green fire.  After judging my own performance, I consider a ratio of 4:1 to be "great", 3:1 is "good", and 2:1 is "not good" (but acceptable on a single attempt if you have bad luck with eye beams).<br>
<br>
Norfin is doing a good job.  Across all attempts, Norfin took 2.88 million damage from Flames of Azzinoth melee and 7.4 million damage from Blaze.  This is a ratio of 3.9:1.  <br>
<br>
Aurica needs improvement.  Across all attempts, Aurica took 2.23 million damage from Flames of Azzinoth melee and 1.03 million damage from Blaze.  This is a ration of 2.16:1.<br>

		<div id="post_message_503641"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I guess it depends entirely on what works best for your raid comp. For P4 we have our meele lined up on the grate (2 rogues, 1 dps warrior) and then all the ranged + healers way back behind the grate. We dont put any dps on Illidan at all during his demon phase. We just tank Illidan, move the raid way back behind the grate area and we all just focus on staying alive and killing demons. Having the 3 meele up front is great for us because they get on the demons and make quick work of them. I can see a big problem if you're doing this with a meele heavy raid though.<br>
<br>
As for advice for cleaning up your P3/P4 what worked for us was to focus on control and survival during this phase. Whole raid moves way, way back when he moves to demon form. No DPS on Illidan, people need to bandage/healthstones/fire potions after the first flame burst. Fire potions are the big thing here, we went through over 500 of them on our first kill night. Make sure if you don't need to be taking super manas people are slamming fire potions on cooldown. We bring 4 shaman and assign one to plop earthbind right on top of Illidan when he's shifting from P3-P4. That snares all the demons immediately, then the other 3 shaman spread their earthbind totems out in front of the raid. Another thing is that it's not so much the demons need to be burned down ASAP, it's that they need to be snared ASAP. Get them snared and then work on killing them. You can put a ton of dps on the demons but if they're moving at 100% speed you're probably going to lose some people. When people go to kill demons they HAVE to keep in mind they cant clump up while killing them. You will lose people to flame bursts if they're clustered up trying to finish demons. Make sure no one gets within ~15, ~20yrd ? near your shadow tank or they're going to eat a massive nuke. Illidans room is quite massive, take advantage of the space we're given for this encounter.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_504543"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->We have everyone run far back the closest anyone should be is the middle of the grate. If melee stand closer and they should get a demon there isnt time to kill it. The first AoE is simply eaten by the raid all standing apart. Then the melee run foward when the dmeons pop. They each have an assigned target left, next leftmost etc. There are 4 ranged nearish the lock to take out fast any demon that happens to target the lock. The demons are slowed by crippling poison, frostbolts etc. When the 2nd AoE occurs the melee are spread apart, its on an exact timer so we know when its about to occur. The healers simply stand at the back healing up the AoE damage during this time. After the the 2nd AoE most of the healers and the tank run forward ready for the pickup. The 3rd AoE occurs with the healers spread near the tanking spot about 20 yards out, the dps spread behind them, all the demons should be dead by then. Illidan wakes up and the melee move in. The initial slow on the demon can be done with traps or EB totems. I always drop an EB totem close to him on transition. It lives long enough to still be up when the demons pop and slows them at the start before the melee arrive.<br>
<br>
Then its onto the next phase. Spamming the tank with heals to ensure he lives even when illidan is enraged. If a trap is close we use it, if its far we ignore it and heal through the enrage to prevent having to move the raid. Parasite people run out of the raid group into space followed by 2 mages who FN and take down the parasites. If you get parasited when illidan is enraged then pop a HS or pot since you will take 4.5k per tick from the parasite debuff. If the MT gets parasite then melee run out and the mages FN the parasite as they come out.<br>
<br>
Rinse and repeat. Be careful when taking him to 30%, control your dps, since any parasites up will still be up when the shield ends and can cause problems.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I would add that control on the phase 4 transition is paramount, seeing as how if it is done while he is lurched over, or demon form, will cause his aggro table to become buggy - generally killing your warlock tank, etc.<br>

For killing demons, we send some heavy hitters in - and it isn't a problem.  We tend to let Edgewalker suicide/reck when more than 1 are on the warlock tank.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>We slick our hair back and live dangerously.  Caution is thrown to the winds with parasites. <br>
<br>
But I can honestly say that we tend to instagib them before they cause any damage since they seem to be up more than half of the time on our transitions.  I'm not sure they are a huge concern, but if they do get out of control, especially in phase 4, you're looking at a world of hurt.  Perhaps as the encounter-control freak that I normally am, I'm going to simply nod and say this is good advice to all those learning this encounter.<br>
<br>
With the hardest part of the fight over (phase 2), and everyone not wanting to "blow" their good attempt, then being careful on the transition seems quite appropriate.  <br>

I am very curious how my intense preparation for Illidan, with the help of this thread, will work out (hopefully this sunday). We are planning on letting the blizzards and SoC take care of the demons though i am not sure how to handle a situation where 3 or 4 of the aoe classes get stunned (since they are already very close to Illidan). Is this just a "I hope this doesn't happen next try" kind of thing or is there any advice on how to not be this dependant on luck using aoe on the demons?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_505956"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->This thread and the video helped a lot, I think we killed both flames for the first time on our 6th attempt ever, once our druid tank bothered to read raid chat and listen to us telling him he can un-zoom his camera more than the interface options allowed him to. <br>
<br>
It's interesting to note how these things help, since we learnt everything we could about p.2 and got over it real soon, then we hadn't given much attention to p.4 and he leveled us there with people just spreading out wherever. We took more time learning demon phase on our own than learning p.2 from ej thread/guides/videos.<br>
<br>
As for aoe on the demons, we abandoned the idea after a bit and placed melee at the front, ranged at the back, didn't dps him at all in demon form. Some still did the aoe but it wasn't a vital part of our tactics. Demons are really no problem as soon as you figure out you need to spread out in a way you don't get flame burst splash but you are close enough for demons as well. If your people are suitably close to each other you can reach and kill them easily. That, and we put a fire resistance cauldron up every 2-3 attempts too.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_511499"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->We made a change in our P2 position tonight that made raid healing much easier.  Instead of a loose, random spread across the grid, we stacked into 4 tight piles based on group number, each out of range of the other.  This made it so two quick Circle of Healing casts would compensate for each fireball.<br>
<br>
As an alliance guild with few active shaman, this more than compensated for lack of chain heals and allowed us to run three raid healers (two CoH priest and our only resto shaman), two dedicated healers per flame tank and 8th 'spot' healer.  After we made this change P2 heals were very clean, even with no consumables.<br>
<br>
It may seem obvious in hindsight, but anyone having trouble with the considerable P2 raid damage should consider repositioning to use Circle of Healing to its fullest.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_513064"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I've been looking at WWS logs of the fight, but admitedly I am not too familiar with the format of the site and I can't really find what I'm looking for.<br>
<br>
My question is: can the Flames of Azzinoth crush?  And if so, is there any way to avoid this?  Since they hit for fire damage, I assume normal elemental rules would seem to apply (i.e. you can't block them and push crushes off the table.)<br>
<br>
My reason for asking this is that I am one of the tanks in my guild with an FR set already made, and I'm wondering if I'll be able to tank a Flame successfully when we get to Illidan. (I'm a paladin btw.)<br>
<br>
My current stats in FR gear: 375 FR, 490 defense, 11.1k hp unbuffed. These are of course subject to improvement as I pick up better gear for the slots I can afford to replace (neck, rings, belt, shoulders, etc.)  The issue is that if they *can* crush and you *can* block them, I'm sitting like 15% avoidance short of where I'd need to be to be uncrushable due to Holy Shield only giving 30% block.<br>
<br>
Any prot paladins out there have experience/success tanking one of these guys?  I'd love to have a role in this encounter, and if I can save someone else the money/time of getting an FR set together that would be great too.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Don't be, the ratio presented in this thread is nowhere near a realistic estimate of first timers there. Our first kill ratios were same as yours, it takes time to learn this phase for tanks especially as at first they are always looking for the eye blast more than anything else and their ratio won't be good. You can still kill the glaives fine with that though, our tanks took almost 2:1 and we barely spread out at all and we just had healers compensating to get past the phase.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Have both your FR tanks using <b>/console CameraDistanceMaxFactor 4</b> and zoom max out, you can't miss the big beam coming towards you then. Also, the blue flame only ticks for ~500 while going through it later.<br>

Indeed, I use oTweaks (manually increase max zoom + max tab distance) ~ Turns out blizzard's default zoom distance is 15, I set mine to 50 and it works great for tanking the Flames (mainly because you have a much greater view, can easily see where the entire raid is and eye blasts from a fair distance<br>

<br>
Can't say phase 2 took that long to learn, pretty much one eye blast a piece to get a feel for the real radius of the beam once able to recognize it from a distance<br>

Zooming out can make encounters in general alot easier especially when dealing with awareness fights.<br>

Barcode's video posted on R&amp;D is an amazing tutorial, definitely took advantage of his "start the flame at the end of his path then run through him after first blaze"<br>

Don't think the "crushing" question has been directly responded to either, The mobs themselves can only crit and not crush, probably why druids are viable FR tanks for this in the first place.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">This video has already been posted in this thread. Together with the explanation of Flame of Azzinoth charge mechanics a very good preparation for all those first time Illidan guilds. <br>
<br>
I am very curious how my intense preparation for Illidan, with the help of this thread, will work out (hopefully this sunday). We are planning on letting the blizzards and SoC take care of the demons though i am not sure how to handle a situation where 3 or 4 of the aoe classes get stunned (since they are already very close to Illidan). Is this just a "I hope this doesn't happen next try" kind of thing or is there any advice on how to not be this dependant on luck using aoe on the demons?</div>

</div>AoEing the Shadow Demons seems like a bad idea. We have our warlocks toss in 1-2 seeds for the Shadow Demons, with the rest of the ranged single targetting. The warlocks then assist in single targetting. Trying to rely on AoE seems doomed to disappointment, as if even two of your AoE classes get paralyzed, you definitely won't be able to finish the Demons. AoEing would also be difficult at best because the Demons tend to spread out, as your raid should be spread in a good 150º around Illidan, nearly. In particular a Shadow Demon fixating on your warlock tank would probably spell death.<br>
<br>
The entire raid is capable of doing damage to the Shadow Demons and you don't need to have any other form of DPS during this phase. There's no reason to complicate things by trying to set up an overly intricate method of defeating a fairly simple part of the fight.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Hamstring / Shiv'ing Crip Poison / Piercing Howl?(usually don't have this in a raid) / Pre-placed frost-traps (shadow demons spawn approx. half-way through demon phase) <br>
<br>
All of the above can be used to snare the demons effectively<br>
<br>
Best thing to do is to make sure everyone knows exactly where to place themselves as soon as he goes demon form (and to back up a considerable amount before demons spawn)<br>
<br>
Phase 5 is where you need to do this on the fly, take the extra minute and save yourself some grief in p 3/4.<br>
<br>
==<br>
From my experience the only way anyone will die in demon phase/shadow demons is if melee splash damage people to death when trying to kill shadow demons. Make sure melee is either spread out on different mobs or timing their attacks so no-one is clumped up when a Fire-volley happens.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>This seems to lack any real thought or attempt to optimize your strategy.  Sure, it can hurt to have your AOE classes stunned, but it also greatly aids in killing them provided you avoid any bad luck.  Whether you single target or not, dps'ers getting demons will slow your dps.  DPS lost is DPS lost, whether it's single target or AOE.  It doesn't change the fact that everyone besides the AOE classes can single target DPS, regardless of who is stunned.  Adding this single target DPS to the AOE just ensures the demons die ultra quick.  Doing only one or only the other just seems to make things less effective overall.<br>
<br>
It's very rare that our demons ever make it more than a few yards from Illidan.  If some of our AOE happens to get paralyzed, they simply make it a bit further out before being killed by shadow priests, hunters, our elemental shaman, and eventually the melee.  No harm, no foul.  Clearly either way works, but combining both AOE and single target seems like a much more effective way to handle them, especially for guilds first leaning the phase.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Don't be, the ratio presented in this thread is nowhere near a realistic estimate of first timers there. Our first kill ratios were same as yours, it takes time to learn this phase for tanks especially as at first they are always looking for the eye blast more than anything else and their ratio won't be good. You can still kill the glaives fine with that though, our tanks took almost 2:1 and we barely spread out at all and we just had healers compensating to get past the phase.</div>

</div>I agree that 2:1 is a good target for a first timer.  They need to learn the trick to blaze--start moving when you see the animation, rather than the fire on the ground.  With this in mind you can almost completely avoid it Blaze damage.  Since my previous post, the best ratio I've managed is 5.8:1 (215k flame, 37k blaze).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Now that makes some sense to me, from the time the trap drops to the time he transforms is lets say 20 seconds, but the trap only lasts 15(?) seconds of that.  I am pulling these numbers out of thin air as I don't know the exact values but it is starting to make sense.<br>
<br>

</div>It's along the same lines, every time he's come out of trap that I've seen (barring maybe 1 or 2) he's targeted the highest person on threat and done something.  It's been times when a melee passed me and got ruined, or he'll cast draw soul, shear, or flame crash then fall to the ground.  In general we never have melee in for the last little bit before he stands up again except on the second trap because either he's dead well before standing up or someone was retarded and we're trying to kill him before we get ruined because our warlock tank died or something.  Usually for the first one I can stay top threat and therefore he targets me and does something, and that's juts not a problem.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Was the mage just combat rezzed? As far as I know the way it works is that they give a hidden "buff" to players within their range. Everyone that has a buff won't be charged. Sometimes when a Shaman ankhs or a player is rezzed he doesn't get the "buff" quickly enough and the elemental can charge that player. Happened for us to a Shaman yesterday as well.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

As discussed previously in this thread, there seems to be a hidden buff given to everyone within about 20 yds of each warglaive. As such, if you move out of that area, or are rez'd, you don't have the buff and the flame charges you.<br>
<br>
To clarify, if someone is charged, then THEY were at fault somehow, not the position of the tank or the flame being tanked.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
Does mortal strike/wound poison actually affect the healing from his draw soul?<br>
<br>
In every log I've seen, every draw soul healed him for 32767 (=2^15-^1, the largest 2byte integer).<br>
Not once was it a different numbers. Over all the dozen wipes I checked, there must have been an event where he healed without a debuff.<br>
The same for Illidari Council, actually. Every heal from Lady Malande healed for 32767, and I'm quite sure many guilds use an MS warrior on Gathios, and do not have any healing debuff on Zerevor.<br>
<br>
<br>
So, does anyone know if that's maybe just a display bug (any tank who can check their own logs?) in the game, or with WWS?<br>
Or does MS/WP simply not matter for the healing on Illidan/Illidari Council?<br>
<br>
<br>
Edit:<br>
Thanks for the replies!<br>
MS/WP work on him, but WWS caps healing at 32767, so it's not displayed.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
Firstly, my initial 'exposure' to this phase, if you will, was via an instructional video by 'Zyklon' that was circulated on our guild forums. In this video, small, slow, constant movements are encouraged by the tank, and I guess thats what I imagine that the majority of tanks would be doing. (Correct me if I'm wrong!)<br>
<br>
Now, the actual reality of this phase is that the Flame of Azzinoth will cast a patch of Blaze, several yards square, every 10 seconds or so. The first patch will appear just as the Fire Blast is cast for the first time, and the period for both Blaze / Blast is very close together, but will gradually move out of synch as the fight progresses. This patch of flame will be cast at the tank's feet. It is not affected by where the Flame of Azzinoth is at the time of casting.<br>
<br>
By using this information, it is possible to make sharp movements, just as Blaze is cast, to keep the damage to a minimum. Theoretically, it would be possible to take zero blaze damage over the entire fight, or at least only one tick per Blaze cast. However, other aspects to the fight, such as the blue Demon Flames, dodging the Eye Blast, as well as lag and worrying about aggro generation will obviously lead to more Blaze damage.<br>
<br>
I guess what I'm saying is that with a proper understanding of the mechanics of this phase its possible to take a LOT less damage from Blaze than you might think. As a guide, I think I took about 1/4 as much damage from Blaze as from the Flame's melee attack last Illidan kill, and I'm sure that theres tanks out there that can, or have done, a lot better than this.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I completely agree with all of this.  It definitely gets harder to predict the Blaze patches as the fight goes on.  Using these sharp movements, the best ratio I've managed is 5.8:1 (215k flame, 37k blaze).  With an accurate blaze timer you could probably do better.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>You can either gradually drag it along a path, or you can use step-movements (or sharp-movements) to move when blaze is about to drop/has dropped. By stepping your movements, it should be possible to avoid most of the blaze damage. As a druid (or warrior/paladin using resillience gear) it's likely you'll get dazed every so often, but its certainly possible to avoid more damage with step-movements than dragging it very slowly.<br>
<br>
Does anyone else get desyncing of the blast (the conal flame thing the flames do) and the blaze dropping? When we started I was under the assumption they're supposed to be linked, but often theres a 1-2 second swing either way on the blaze dropping before or after the conal attack which stays throughout that whole instance of the fight (i.e. each time you start it, not each time you reset the instance).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_533696"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Last night we saw something new:<br>
<br>
Maiev literally dropped the first trap directly under Illidan.  We were panicked for a moment trying to figure out where the hell it was until I realized it was right under his model.  It instantly trapped him.  Because there was no elapsed time between the trap going down and it being applied, the trap actually wore off him about 5-10 sec before he was due to transform.  So he popped up, one-shotted a melee who had overaggroed, and then resumed beating on our tank while enraged for a good while before he finally transformed.  Confused the hell out of us.<br>
<br>
On a separate note, pretty much purely for epeen, has anyone been able to do p3 in just one demon phase?  We've been getting him to like 32% right before his second transformation the last couple of weeks and then backing off rather than risk having him change phases during or after a transformation.  The temporary patch 2.2 "bug" pretty much permanently took like 6 minutes off our kill times and the fight is around 13min total for us now.  It's funny how rethinking DPS vs. control can make such a large difference, without changing raid composition at all (we've always brought 8 healers, and continue to do so).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_533710"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Dukes, I have also had that problem tanking flames. It seems like there is just some sort of delay for the Blaze appearing after their AoE Cone attack. I typically try to anticipate this and move early, and it seems to work out alright. In other words, even though there is a delay, the Blaze will still appear in the spot where the AoE Cone hit you originally, and not where you have moved premptively. You can actually use this to your advantage, and avoid alot of Blaze damage.<br>
<br>
Also, on the subject of tanking with resilience and getting dazed, I don't remember once having a problem with daze if you use strafing primarily. In fact, I can't think of any point in my kiting path where my back is exposed to the flame. The one trouble spot I can imagine is at the top end of your path where you have to turn the flame around and head back toward it's starting position. I simply wait for an AoE fire attack, warn the melee to move over TS, then strafe and turn the flame, never exposing my back. It's true that the flame is pointed at the raid briefly during this move, but I time the Fire Attacks/Blazes to avoid any risk.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Well obviously we all have full t6 or equivalent gear so we kind of outgear the fight to an extent.  But mainly it's just a matter of being aggressive with DPS, ranged up front DPSing him for the first 10-15sec of his demon phases, backing off as he casts demons, burning them down, and then getting in another 5-10sec of DPS on him until it's time to stop for the transition back to humanoid form.  We have three pretty awesome arcane mages (RIP MSD  ) which helps too.

</div>Once you have a firm grasp on the Flame Burst timers it really becomes much less of an issue.  <br>
<br>
When demons are due, everyone makes sure they aren't stupidly close (especially the warlock tank).  When demons pop out, everyone stays put for ~5 seconds and nukes whatever is near them.  Then he does his second Flame Burst.  Now you have 15sec of freedom and the melee can zerg in and finish everything off very quickly.  Then spread back out before the third Burst, and then he reverts to humanoid form 5 seconds later.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_533856"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Thanks - that makes a lot of sense.<br>
<br>
We've only killed him twice so far, so our strategy is far from perfected. I'm pretty interested in optimizing it. Your 13 min kill is pretty impressive - considering ours have been almost 10 minutes longer. Some of that is gear, sure, but the bulk of it has got to be better application of dps, better positioning etc.<br>
<br>
I think we get almost zero dps on the boss during the demon phase and most of it is a positioning problem. In an effort to get enough time on the spawns, I had people back up quite a lot - most of the raid is on or behind the circular grate. Also we spread perhaps a lot more than needed for the flame burst. Folk are spread wall to wall. This puts a lot of folk quite far out of range of the boss.<br>
I think paying more attention to packing the raid better - perhaps on the grate or close to it, we'll have everyone closer to the boss and therefore not spend 6-7 seconds moving in order to get into range.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>We had a trap directly under Illidan sometime recently as well, unfortunately he was at 3% and would've died that enrage anyway so it was kind of a waste.  Also, I've heard people complain about "unusable" traps that are in the wall or something, but last week we had both traps literally unusable, she placed them outside the room. I didn't even know this was possible.  I ran back to the wall to take a screenshot after he died - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080410113118/http://img218.imageshack.us/img218/4313/loltrapslf8.jpg" target="_blank">http://img218.imageshack.us/img218/4313/loltrapslf8.jpg</a><br>
<br>
Also, another epeen question I have is, has anyone killed him in the first trap?  If you guys had the very first trap right under him, how low did he go before that first demon phase sub 30%?  I think we got him to like 12% with no trap and no heroisms, I'm just curious if its possible to kill him before he even goes demon sub 30%.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I read through the first 8 pages of this thread, and have to say; I've learned pretty much everything I need to know; except for 2 questions:<br>
<br>
1) Since the anti-charge "totem fix", does this also apply to Rebirth targets in Phase 2? Or only totems?<br>
2) Earlier in the thread, it was stated that the Blue flames created by Illidan's Eye Laser can be destroyed via Spell Reflect just like A'lar's Flame Patches. Is this still possible? Or was it fixed? Also, can the flames created by Illidan's Flame Crash also be destroyed by Spell Reflect?<br>
<br>

<br>
On a separate note, pretty much purely for epeen, has anyone been able to do p3 in just one demon phase?  We've been getting him to like 32% right before his second transformation the last couple of weeks and then backing off rather than risk having him change phases during or after a transformation.  The temporary patch 2.2 "bug" pretty much permanently took like 6 minutes off our kill times and the fight is around 13min total for us now.  It's funny how rethinking DPS vs. control can make such a large difference, without changing raid composition at all (we've always brought 8 healers, and continue to do so).</div>

</div>We tank him right against the wall and the traps about 50% of the time come within 10 yd; tonight we happened to get both traps right under him and had two different experiences:<br>
<br>
The first time, he went straight to demon phase after trap (switching early, because he was trapped right away) and stayed red for a while after. Scared our warlock tank, but he wasn't actually doing extra damage in that phase.<br>
<br>
The second time, exactly what you described: a couple people got one-shot after the trap expired. We've had that a few times actually, so it was more confusing when the first one happened and he seemed to be bugging out.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_534761"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Here's a big tip for anyone having trouble with tank healing in P2: multiple Resto druids really make a huge difference.  The past two weeks we've added a second healing druid to our roster and the stacked HoT's (especially Lifebloom at 1s intervals) work to counteract the flame DoT's very effectively.<br>
<br>
Naturally, they also bring extra innervates, combat resses and NS (for Dark Barrage) which are both especially effective on a fight like Illidan.<br>
<br>
Personally I consider P2 to be the most challenging part of the fight, so it's worth making alterations to raid composition to ensure it goes smoothly.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>As you can see, there's a pretty big variance in kill time. As people get ued to it, it gets a lot shorter, and once you outgear it bigtime it helps a lot too. It's pretty strange to think that we now kill it in half the time of our first kill (and that the timer was 15 minutes (!) in 2.2). I'm not sure if we could get it down to one demon phase - the 13 minute kill was us pushing a bit to see how fast we could get it without being stupid about dying/ripping in p2, but we've never tried an all out "lets just burn" kind of thing (and I'm pretty sure it would fail horribly with people ripping on P2 anyway). We also never DPS during the demon phase - it's just the lock tank and people standing there like lemons making sure they don't die, so it could easily be lower than that.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_536404"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I think it's as fixed as it can be without breaking so there's no risk to ressing dead people at all.<br>
<br>
As far as I can see, the blade pulse their aura every x seconds (I presume 2 for decent even spacing) and the Flames do a charge check every y seconds (I like to say 10 when trying to explain it, because if fits neatly with my 2 second theory), thus leaving a 2s risk period every 10s where any newly ressed people can be charged.<br>
<br>
It is certainly a lot better than when you couldn't lay totems in P2 for the bloody charges.<br>
<br>
As for Blaze and the Blast being desynced, I find it mildly irritating that it can happen at odd times during your tanking session, it's pretty easy to settle into a rythym if they're consistant in the beginning that results in some very nice Blaze:Melee ratios, and then they desync and suddenly you've taken 4 Blaze ticks because you moved when you expected it and it actually came after.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>That screenshot is amazing.  I doubt they'll ever fix her traps - I think you just have to plan to blow SW/LS/etc on subsequent enrages.  <br>
<br>
We get a LOT of traps along the wall, where essentially you'd have to antikite illidan into the trap, meaning he'd feed on the raid doing so.  <br>

12% is about right - usually its 1 demon phase and dead... a trap I suppose could make it instant.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_538355"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->When do agonizing flames happen? We spread out once we got to phase 3 expecting them to happen and not one person reported getting them.<br>
<br>
Edit: It's probably more along the lines of nobody noticing it, or the fact that half the raid was dead and spreading wasn't a problem. Or that the person that got the agonizing flames instantly died.<br>
<br>
Besides consistency we pretty much know what to do in Phase 2 and should be able to consistently get this down with a few tank adjustments in the next hour of raid attempts (next reset). So to expand on my initial question what should we really expect in phase 3? Im under the impression from this thread that it's fairly similiar to phase 1 with the agonizing flames and a recurring demon phase every ~1 minute. <br>
<br>
How exactly do the agonizing flames work? There have been mentions of it in the thread but not a full explanation. Does it target one person and cause damage to people around the afflicted person (like a conflag) until said person moves? Or upon impact does it splash to multiple targets making it so multiple people are taking the debuff? If so, i'll be upset with yet another thing that melee has to be generally careful about (blaze trails, eye beams, demon fire) or absent for (demon phase, for the most part anyways).<br>
<br>
Any information would be greatly appreciated as the thread seems to have deviated into multiple phases of the fight anyway. Sorry if in fact this has been answered somewhere in the thread.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>He casts a blue Flamestrike on one person, I've never seen it cast on people in melee.<br>
It has a 5 yard radius diameter, fairly small.<br>
<br>
On impact, it deals 4k firedamage and leaves a DoT on the affected person(s), dealing 36k fire damage over 60 seconds, ticking every 5 seconds (according to wowhead - <a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?spell=40932" target="_blank">Agonizing Flames - Spells - World of Warcraft</a>). I remember the damage ticks being small in the beginning and becoming larger towards the end, around ~4.5k I think.<br>
Running out of the fire will not stop the DoT from ticking, healers have to keep you up for the whole minute.<br>
<br>
So - spread out to make sure that only one person gets hit by it every time. Run out the burning ground if you get hit, and make sure that healers keep you covered.<br>
The flames on the ground will disappear, but the flame DoT on you will usually last into the demon phase.<br>
Having agonising flames when he casts flame burst can be a large burst potential - make sure your healers know that, and save potions/stones for flame bursts there.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

As best I can tell with Agonizing, it has a minimum range but also can target the MT as an exception to this behavior.

<br>
How do you keep up melee dps on the Flames/P2? I've been checking a lot of WWS reports and those where the melee (rogues mostly) are on par with top damage dealers (mostly warlocks) they have done about 200k to the Flames. On our kill today we had no melee over 20k damage on the Flames. This because we stand in four groups, and we can only dps the Flames when the tanks drags it right across our spot (if we move too close to the other groups we chain the aoe fire). And half the time the tank will walk the Flame on the outside of a fire line and we can't walk through. The only time we can move in to dps is when he passes our group position in the "inner" circle of his path. When the first Flame dies we swap postions with the group across from us, so that we can get some dps on the other Flame. <br>
<br>
Since this was our first kill we were very cautious though, so we might be able to move closer into the flames on the ground and dps it, but I'm not sure.<br>
<br>
What do you do to maximize melee dps on the Flames?</div>

Maximising melee damage on the Flames is all about your kiting path, by creating a path that uses a large initial kite path (I use the outer circle on my initial pass) and by kiting so the Blaze is always either directly in line with your kite or to a degree outside it, you can keep melee on a Flame until a beam happens or it dies. The only risk usually comes when turning around to go back, but a quick call in vent or /RW usually helps</div>

</div>It sounds like you're requiring your melee DPS to stay in one of your camps. If that's wrong, please correct me. Otherwise, I think most guilds have their melee ignore the camps for the most part and follow the first flame tank's path (standing behind it and avoiding the flames, obviously). For us, if one tank is behind the flames, the other tank's mob is usually in a spot where melee can still DPS it. The only time our melee DPS start worrying about not chaining damage between camps is when both elementals are out of range of melee (as in, the tank is stuck behind the flames on the ground).<br>

				The flame elementals are difficult, so here's another question that might end up benefitting everyone if they are not still bugged regarding totems. Would it be possible for them to be tanked temporarily by Fire Elemental Totems? The totem pet is (to the best of my knowledge) immune to fire damage. A few hunters could misdirect the pet, generate threat for it for a few seconds, and help mitigate alot of damage for the next two minutes (the pets life span). Just a wild idea. Thanks.

</div>They wouldn't be able to generate any threat after the misdirects, so your healers would probably pull it off of the elementals before they disappeared. It'd also be very hard to control where the mob is facing, so you may be putting the raid at risk of the frontal damage from the flames.</div>

<br>
Maximising melee damage on the Flames is all about your kiting path, by creating a path that uses a large initial kite path (I use the outer circle on my initial pass) and by kiting so the Blaze is always either directly in line with your kite or to a degree outside it, you can keep melee on a Flame until a beam happens or it dies. The only risk usually comes when turning around to go back, but a quick call in vent or /RW usually helps</div>

</div>We have killed him 4 times now and have kept melee completely out of the action for phase 2.  We have generally run a ranged heavy raid for Illidan (3-4 each of mages and warlocks, 3 shadow priests), with extra healing support (9-10 healers where we typically run with 8) and only 1-2 rogues plus a fury warrior and sometimes a ret pally.  I made this decision after a few times learning phase 2 when all seemed chaos for the Flame tanks.  We used the N, S, E, W groups position to minimize flame splash damage.  <br>
<br>
I would like to get melee involved on phase 2, but am concerned with the blazes on the ground.  The initial kite path uses the inner circle and then goes out and thus I was concerned that melee would get lost in the flames and people would not see to heal us or we would get destroyed by the blazes on the ground.  Any additional tips for involving melee on phase 2 would be greatly appreciated.</div>

<br>
Basically, melee will able to attack the Flame for the entirety of your kite path barring a beam or two. There northern and southern apexs are a bit dangerous for beams since they will form around 10-15 feet away and usually proceed through the lower kite area fairly quickly. By the time you've got back to your starting area, nearly half the blazes are gone since it is a fairly long kite path.<br>
<br>
You can flip the image and it's almost exactly the same for the other side. The 2nd tank usually has an easier time of kiting because they only have to worry about beams, if you are including melee then trying to maximise melee and watching for beams can be fatal : b</div>

		<div id="post_message_540782">For our first kill last week we ran relatively balanced raid, if trending slightly towards ranged (1 rogue, 2 dps wars, 1 enhancement shm - 4 mages, 3 locks, 1 spriest, 1 hunter).<br>
<br>
I basically have our melee engage when we're first starting Phase 2 - there aren't many blazes, and the kite path our druid tank takes allows them to stay on the edge of the grate for the first pass.  The main danger during this time isn't blaze, but rather a melee falling asleep and getting destroyed by a tangential eye beam.  After the first pass, they're kind of out of luck unless blazes clear up and they can get a few hits in.  Ranged do most of the work in P2, for sure.<br>
<br>
I think not letting your melee get into the fray <u>at all</u> in P2 is a mistake, as they can easily add some damage up front before both sides get covered in blazes and eye beams.  Certainly towards the middle portion of the phase, they're pretty useless.  However, if you get lucky and the eye beams are on the opposite side, they can certainly help shorten the phase for you.</div>

</div>There is no way you can heal melee standing in Blaze, and if they get one tick of blaze, they'll risk dying to a fireball before they get healed. One thing that helps melee dps there is to start the kite path on the outside circle. That way melee can dps through one full kite circle, and when it's time to kite on the outside again, the flame should be close to dead anyway.<br>
<br>
Melee are close to useless on the second flame, but that's not a big deal because P2 is much eaiser after one flame is down.</div>

</div>I think it's wiser to tell your melee to not get hit by Blaze at all. Blaze ticks each second and there can be overlaps. You could literally die in 0.5 seconds from Blaze alone, not to mention Fireballs. Just remember to stand at max range and that the Blazes is put where the tank is and you'll be fine.</div>

</div>Most ranged boss abilities have a check for this.  Usually if there are no targets that are the required distance away, a boss will pick a random target.  I can't confirm that this is true with agonizing flames--but it is my suspicion.</div>

		<div id="post_message_543302">We've only just started attempting Illidan with a full night's worth of attempts last night and were able to get a fairly clean phase 2 by the end of the night (one Barrage death, and a rogue played with fire).  Unfortunately, we didn't spread out well enough for Flame Burst and died to the first Demon phase :P<br>
<br>
The one thing I'm still not clear about after reading this thread is Charge/Enrage mechanic of the Flames.  Early in the thread, people were echoing the Bosskillers description of the Charge/Enrage with regards to the tank, say that they should kite similarly so that they're not too far away from the other Flame.  <br>
<br>
By the middle of this thread, there were posts that state as long as you stay within 20-25 yd of either of the Glaives in the ground, the Flames won't charge and enrage.  I tend to believe this since we can safely kill one Flame without worrying about the other Flame charging.  <br>
<br>
Does the relative positioning of the Flames matter at all?  Or can the Tanks move independently of each other as long as they stay in the safe zones granted by the Glaives so that they can avoid Beams and Blazes?</div>

		<div id="post_message_545759">My guild killed Illidan for the first time last night. Our kill was also the first time we had seen phase 5 (the enrage/trap phase). Consequently, we still don't understand all of the mechanics. <br>
<br>
Specifically, Maiev laid two traps (one before each demon phase) but we could not get Illidan trapped. Each trap was clearly visible, not in any object, and about 10 yards from our MT (although they were both placed in blue rings of fire from Flame Crashes). Our MT dragged Illidan on top of the traps, but reported that he was not receiving the gold "gear" icon and could not interact with the traps. Several other melee also attempted to activate the traps by clicking on them and reported the same result. Fortunately our healers kept the MT up through the enrages and we completed the subsequent demon phases. While it's certainly possible to ignore the traps, we would like to have the option to use them. Any advice, suggestions, or further details about the trap springing mechanics would be greatly appreciated.<br>

</div>No you can't "consume" the flame, but the blue flame damage is really, really trivial (600/tic I think). Compared to the Blaze damage which is 1300+ (stacking if you keep the flame in one spot too long). Your tank can basically stand in the blue flames for as long as necessary, just don't get hit by the initial beam.</div>

</div>Er, sort of.  The way the fire works is it is several 2-3 yard circles connected with overlap as it lies on the ground.  Each segment of the line is its own "NPC" -- this was more obvious when you could spell reflect and kill the beam.  What this means is that you can stand in up to 3 segments of the fire at once if you are positioned exactly between the segments.  So yeah I guess it can tick up to 3 times a second, if it is simply move and you'll tick for 1-2 instead.<br>

</div>If the trap is too far away for the MT to get to it by himself without causing too much chaos then just don't use it.  Shield wall, or last stand, evasion trinket, etc.  The enrage is really, really weak.  Anyway, when you get to phase 5 traps should be the slightest of your concerns so try not to overthink things.  Other than that, yeah you could use intervene as mentioned above but I wouldn't really worry about it.</div>

Our MT was mercifully fast on the Shield Wall button, but it was a nasty shock regardless.<br>
<br>
I suspect this happened because he didn't manage to enrage before he was in the trap, but I can't confirm since WWS doesn't seem to have logged Enrage. It definitely isn't handled through cooldowns, because the second enrage + trap happened on schedule ten seconds later.<br>

</div>Karazhan gives more per instance clear, but considering the shorter reset ZA gives more per week.  Obviously if you're trying to get badge FR, you should be running both.  But since You can do ZA twice in a week and Kara only once they are at least on equal footing as far as the rate of badge acquisition goes.<br>
<br>
At the moment we're working on Phase 2, so we've been trying to do as many Badge-earning instances as possible, including handing  the vial down to the FR tanks when possible.</div>

		<div id="post_message_554838">We killed illidan last night and I would like to thank everyone who posted constructive comments in this post.<br>
<br>
First night we had serious issues in phase 2, our tanks were dieing too easily because I had shown them the instructional video. I knew that it would be np if they would simply go further on the sides, we worked on that and from that point, phase 2 was a breeze everytime. <br>
<br>
Also a good trick is to have your tanks understand that if they dont ever want to get hit by eye beam, there is one place where he will never eye beam and that is at the crossing of the 2 beams but further out of the circle. Everytime there is an eye beam the tank can move over there quickly, let the elemental breathe a few times then come back into his regular pattern.<br>
<br>
Phase 3-4-5 are supposed to be easier than 2 but that was not my experience. At first we were having deaths caused by the fireballs, so spreading was an issue. When that got better all kind of little mistakes were happening: <br>
<br>
1. The tank rushed into a trap his back turned and got shear then insta killed <br>
2. The warlock tank decided to move a few steps and his pally healer didnt pay attention, got hit by the aoe<br>
3. After a trap some people stood in front of illidan, resulting in a heal from 18 to 25%.<br>
<br>
Basically, phase 3 the pression needs to be kept down (The person I put in charge of RL doesnt understand that :P) and everyone needs to be alert, it's kinda of like an idiot check.<br>
<br>
Oh, also, the demons got much easier once we tried the strategy where warlocks throw SoC's right before they spawn. It's dangerous because the warlocks have to move in closer but on the other hand if they got it right theres no way any demon will get on a target. I highly suggest that strategy for guilds looking for a first kill.<br>
<br>
Anyway, thanks again!</div>

		<div id="post_message_554911">We just don't bother using traps anymore, unless they are really close to Illidan. The enrage is easily healed through without CD's being used, but you may want to use CD's anyway just to make sure. He should die after 2 and at the most 3 enrage anyway, unless of course people are getting draw soul.<br>
<br>
The funny thing about the fight is it has the ability to spiral out of control more then any fight in the game. (except Archimonde). Its frustrating though, because unlike Archimonde the encounter is very long. Phase two you can have people die to Eye Beams and Blaze. Parasites can cause a wipe at any portion of the fight if people aren't paying attention. The biggest thing for us is the failure to understand the flame bursts and the entirety of the demon phase. People just fail to grasp that flame burst is an AoE splash damage attack that affects people within ~5 range and get themselves killed because of it. Some will run around frantically trying to kill the Demons without regard that they're standing on top of someone with the flame burst coming in 1-2 seconds lol.<br>
<br>
That said we do use an AoE strat for the demons. Mages front load flame strikes and the Warlocks spam SoC ~2 seconds before demons, usually getting 2-3 of them off (atleast one from each, more depending on if Warlocks get a demons or not). We typically have no problems with this unless an earthbind was positioned wrongly or failure to lay any snaring items at all. Other then that range typically brings it home for us in the Demon Phase with the melee creeping up during flame bursts to help with the demons when they see fit. A good save was a sprint and cloak by me to save our Warlock tank who had a fast approaching demon. Luckily it was killed but we wiped later in the encounter anyways ;(</div>

		<div id="post_message_554991">We stand really far away from Illidan and use traps to slow the demons down.  Each melee gets assigned a demon for crippling poison/hamstring and then the ranged kills them.  The length of the fight means it's not worth it to us to risk having people get killed by the demons by using flamestrikes or other things that require them being within 30 yards or so of Illidan.<br>
<br>
I think the most important thing for us was spending 5-10 minutes just figuring out where everyone should be standing in all the phases before doing the actual fight.  Considering how easy it is to kill 2-3 other people due to bad positioning (Flame Burst or Phase 2's Fireballs) and how important it is to spread out the DPS in the shadow demon phase, we went from consistently failing on the post-phase 2 phases to an easy kill.</div>

I can't agree more. The initial twenty minutes or so I spent taking the time to spread my raid out into post-Phase 2 positioning and practicing the transitions between the phases was by far the most beneficial twenty minutes spent learning any encounter in TBC. While there is still some confusion (specifically from people not present for most of our initial learning), quick communication over Vent and through in-game chat solves the positioning problems and helps keep the stress level down.<br>
<br>
One other suggestion with regards to learning positioning:<br>
I have our raid stand in their initial Phase 2 positions while we buff before each pull. Initially it made it easier to notice positioning mistakes and ensure the four squads have similar numbers of people (we use a N,S,E,W four squad strategy). Now, though, despite only two kills under our belt, the positioning is second nature for my raid.</div>

</div>Same thing happened to us a couple days ago but we had a ms warrior not watching aggro during the trap to blame.To me it seems to be working fine: Draw Soul CD is ready and for the split second Illidan is neither trapped nor changing form he decides to use his ability. It would have been manageable too since a melee can just turn him around...you have to expect it though.<br>

		<div id="post_message_557383">It's related directly to aggro. Usually he'll get a split second where he can do one random thing (melee/shear/draw soul) on whoever has the highest threat after the trap before transitioning to demon form. It'd help to have whoever is at 70% or more of the tank's threat monitor their aggro during trap and move to face Illidan away from the raid in case of a draw soul.<br>

In my experience only a recklessness executing warrior has a chance of pulling hate and since they're melee they can just turn Illidan around with no problem.</div>

		<div id="post_message_557710">We are about a week, possibly 2 away from illidan. I had a couple questions regarding phase 2.<br>
<br>
Now we have had a couple our or prot tanks move on from the game in the last few weeks and may not be able to replace them by the time we get to Illidan so...<br>
<br>
Can feral druid and prot paladins tank the flames (yes I realize warriors are far more ideal but we may only have one warrior capable of doing so)?<br>
<br>
Def cap and FR cap are both important, but again shit happens, we may not have quite those stats, would 350ish FR and def cap be acceptable?<br>
<br>
If not to the above perhaps I could get a gear list of ideal FR gear per slot for the tanks. So far the list I had (feel free to correct me in any way here)<br>
<br>
Heroic boots 45 FR<br>
Heroic chest 60 FR<br>
Heroic gloves 40 FR<br>
Heroic legs 55 FR<br>
JC crafted neck 30 FR<br>
Old TK key reward ring 30 FR<br>
20 FR to a tanking helm 20 FR<br>
<br>
Total 350 with the paladin/shaman buff.<br>
<br>

<br>
Actually neither of our tanks are crit immune, close though, and I think they're just around the FR cap. They do get crit once in a while, but usually survive it.<br>
<br>
Earlier in this thread there was a comment from a person that had their MT equip some FR gear, aka quite below the FR cap, and still handle the flame tanking. The flames do not hit that hard that the FR is really necessary, the FR is necessary for the blazes and demon fires. So if your tanks are a bit undergeared for the job, they can mostly perform their way out of it or stack a healer or two extra to get through it.</div>

<br>
Feral Druid is fine and like others mentioned is a nice trade off. More damage taken, but you can open up on the feral druid target a lot quicker which is probably more important anyway. The quicker you get one flame down, the easier it is on healers and well, the easier phase 2 gets </div>

</div>Yes. Im a feral-druid who tanks the flames. My gear is basically:<br>
<br>
4 FR armour parts, obtained from heroic-badges (100 badges)<br>
Al'ar cloak with 15 FR enchant on it<br>
Necklace with FR, obtained from a quest in either SV or Karazhan (I forgot, its blue)<br>
Crafted blue belt (Blastguard belt or smth)<br>
Onyxia trinket (....)<br>
<br>
With the Fire-resistance aura from a paladin and a Flask of Chromatic Wonders I reach 389 FR, which is more then you need.  Also did it with a flask of defense, giving me only 354 FR which also works fine. <br>
<br>
You can 'easily' slack abit on defense and compensate with resilience. I use the exalted keepers of time trinket with stamina and resilience, PvP-bracers and thats basically it </div>

We use a prot paladin on one of the flames with success.<br>
<br>
Our next step is to get the positioning for the remaining phases in order so people dont get all crispy from standing to close.<br>
<br>
51% was our best attempt i think  <br>

Very cool fight so far!<br>
<br>
We also had issues with keeping people with dark barrage up. Global cooldown + the time it took to target the person getting bombed and fire of a heal, he'd already be dead or close to anyways. But raid healers simply "slack" a bit just before the timer so they're ready to rescue that person.. but damn you need to be on your toes.<br>

Any tips on this, besides from people saving healthstones and pots (and remembering to use them)</div>

A question of my own - is there some sort of timer on trap debuff? Didn't look like Bigwigs is detecting it, I heard DBM doesn't either, and it's kinda hard to tell how long it's left on it.

</div>Thanks for the reply, <br>
We had more than a few times where we were still busy healing people up from the aoe damage, so i started flash healing immedietly when they got the barrage.. and it's not like we lost many during the night, but i guess it's another case of L2REFLEX! <br>

And we aim for around 10k hp on that fight, without gimping stats too much.</div>

</div>We got our first kill with two feral druids (including myself) tanking the flames.  Crit immunity is certainly important, but most ferals should be able to accomplish that with a bit of regular tank gear and one or two PvP pieces -- we both use S3 hats and pvp bracers, for example.<br>
<br>
However, as much as the flame's own attacks hurt and would hurt a lot more if they were to crit, I think the majority of the damage taken will be from the breath and blazes, so max FR and stam are probably even more important.  This is probably obvious but the Chromatic Wonder flask truly is wonderful on this fight.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

And we're back to 37%!<br>
<br>
Note: Of all the people to run out early .. our MS warrior.  Not his fault he did the right thing, just sucks.<br>
<br>
This was followed up by a 15% MT death (44k dmg in 2 seconds.. non-enrage) and some cloth-FR-geared ferals tanking him to the end.  Definitely a unique and memorable kill.  Not often you see a 10m dmg Illidan kill.<br>
<br>
<br>
About the p2 stuff - yea.. feral/warrior works nicely.  We use 2 ferals due to not having a 2nd prot warrior.. but idealy you'd have feral on the 1st flame, prot warr on 2nd flame.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I was getting 4500tick parasited at the time, but the damage was pretty silly. (It was a  little over 2 seconds, but 45,290 damage.) He was clearly enraged at the time, but I believe there were no traps up, and he wasn't red---but tito might remember better than myself.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Not sure about the not-red part of it, but this week on Maeiv she simply didn't drop a trap between demon phases once.  Its no big deal if your tank has shield wall or last stand to hit though.<br>
<br>
I've personally never seen numbers that high though enraged or not which leads me to believe he wasn't properly debuffed or your tank isn't using stoneshields for phase 3 onward, which is a bad idea IMO.<br>

</div>We had something equally weird for this week's kill.  Maiev dropped the trap right on Illidan, Illidan gets trapped and we dps him.  He then exits out of trap and proceeds to Enrage.  Thankfully, he transitioned to Demon form 5 seconds later and we had enough healing to keep our MT up without burning shield wall since the next trap was dropped on the wall and our MT had to burn shield wall there.  <br>
<br>
I had always thought Illidan had to be enraged before the trap triggers, but I guess not.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_570259"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Just had our third Illidan kill tonight and we never used traps - but reading this makes me wonder if we somehow rely on luck when I just tank through the enrages? I don't blow my shieldwall or even last stand. I pop a iron shield pot from p3 and onwards and make sure the healers knows the enrage is comming and that's about it. Maybe we run with too many healers (8-9 normally) or maybe we've just been lucky so far.<br>
<br>
To me it seems like the danger is much higher trying to move him to some akward placed trap than just dealing with the small extra damage output if he's debuffed properly.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>We use a rather undergeared tank for Illidan.  The damage that he took will be higher than most illidan tanks, but still.  Even if he was taking 10% less damage from the melee attacks - that would have been over 40k in 2.2 seconds.<br>
<br>
<br>
I looked at the logs more closely and figured out (roughly) what happened:<br>
around 20:15 he came out of demon form (first few melee hits on him by the tank)<br>

</div>I find it hard to believe that no one in the raid noticed him go red - it was ~40 seconds after he transitioned phases and he wasn't all red.  His first several attacks we relatively low (ok, aside from the 4k).. one of them even under 2k.  Then he just exploded.  McGash took an average of 5300 dmg per attack with 62.7% avoidance on that fight.  Max hit was 12482.  figures.<br>
<br>
At any rate - note it as a weird oddity or perhaps we just got SUPER unlucky (followed by a super lucky sheared-bear tanking illidan thru an enrage about 2min later).  Yes, our tank is less geared than most.. but we make due.  From other posts, it seems we weren't the only ones to have weird stuff happen [this week].<br>

</div>DI takes you out of combat. It's not much difference between using a soulstone or clicking DI off, but a soulstone is the better option, because there is always the chance you can kill the demon just in time.<br>
In both of our Illidan kills, i never soulstoned myself (demon form tank), and only died once to a demon due to my own stupidity (I stood way to close to Illidan, simply build ~25k thread and run ~40 y away, that should be plenty of time to kill the demon).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I wouldn't recommend this as an option for guilds arriving at Illidan, since P2 healing is hectic enough. It also can hinge on the ability of the raid to take down that elemental -fast-, to minimize the amount of extra healing throughput and longevity needed. (For example, a really, really shitty first eye beam can completely screw over melee dps, and it's beyond the raid's control)<br>
<br>
That aside, your point is taken. I guess I just feel a little touchy about the idea of not actually having the FR cap at some points, after lovingly putting together an FR set. :P<br>
<br>
Edit: Wouldn't recommend = re: less than capped FR, not re: 1 paladin.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_571809"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I'm playing around with a strat that requires everyone (except the tanking group) to group up 50+ yards away after the first flame burst as the demons are spawning. This would cause the demons to all head to roughly the same location...and allow for easier slowing and aeing.  By grouping up i don't mean stacking...I just want everyone to be able to go against the back wall and not have to worry too much about being beside someone for the spawn.  <br>
<br>
So would you have enough time to group up in the back for the demon spawn and then spread back out to kill them before the next flame burst hit?  From what DBM says you'd have 6 seconds to spread out.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Everyone but the people who got the demons would be able to spread.  This will result in 4 ppl stuck close to each other, quite likely "splashing" each other.<br>
<br>
Try and get as close as possible to each other and the back wall, <b>while still being out of splash-range</b>.  You can get pretty close - 5 yards is about the distance I think.  Use the entire back wall length.<br>
<br>
If I just misread you and this is what you meant - then good.. thats what you should be doing.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Apologies in advance if I come off as being rude, butI wasn't charged by the other flame. I was right next to the flame being killed, withen melee range. I died, waited a bit, ankh'd, started to bandage, and the flame while being right next to me, turned and melee'd me, and continued to beat on our druid tank as usual, with the other flame doing nothing unusual.<br>
<br>
Sorry for the rudeness that might have happened, and the large amount of ,'s.</div>

</div>I believe there's some discussion on this topic at the beginning of this thread. That's how I see it as working as well. The buff "pulses" every few seconds, like Tremor Totem and the like.<br>
<br>
We've never bothered rezzing anyone until the Phase 3 transition. No use chancing a second death and wasting a combat rez.<br>
<br>
Might also explain why sometimes (very, very rarely) one of our tanks gets charged while seemingly in range of the Glaives. If he steps out of the aura for a second, it pulses and removes the buff during that time, and then steps back into the aura range, it'll take a few seconds before the pulse happens and rebuffs him, meaning he's a valid charge target.</div>

		<div id="post_message_577666">Well, we got our first Illidan kill tonight on our first full night of attempts on him - so Id like to thank all the contributors to this thread for making it such an excellent resource... and share my thoughts on phase 2.<br>
<br>
We found , as many people here said, ph2 is the whole fight. By the time your raiding-members have learnt Essence of Souls, Illidari Council, Bloodboil, Shahraz, Archimonde etc - your members already have all the experience and tools to make Illidan a very manageable fight (careful positioning, fast reaction to danger, executing class-specific roles and a responsibility for self-survival) - its just about actually trying him and the rest comes naturally. We killed him on the third time we got past phase 2. Really, bar some stupid mistake - the fight feels like its in the bag once you leave 65% cleanly (though of course, no reason to get complacent).  We opted for a 4-group strat in Phase 2 as others have suggested, but more specifically I made this this picture which we use for our layout.<br>
<br>
We had a FRAPS of our kill showing the whole fight, with vent. The Video (about 170mb) clearly shows 4-point Phase 2 group setup and group switching when cut off by blue beams etc:  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304072427/http://files.filefront.com/Illidan+Stormrageavi/;9267566;/fileinfo.html" target="_blank">Illidan_Stormrage.avi - FileFront.com</a><br>
<br>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304072427im_/http://img140.imageshack.us/img140/543/illidanph2rev6dp2.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<br>
* Note, the blue line (eyebeam) path isnt exact in the spawn points- but rather a general indication of the direction the beam heads and why the raid must stay in the centre. <br>
** Groups 4 and 5(melee group) are interchangeable for the phase. If Group 5 is cut off from Elemental A with a blue beam they will swap. If Elemental A dies they also swap. Group 1+2 refers to the healers/range component of those groups (the 3 tanks are in these groups so it should only be 6-7 people, depending on how many melee we take)<br>
*** Make sure all your assigned MT healers are either in Groups 1+2 or Group 3 so that they never have to move and can 100% focus on MT spamming the whole phase.<br>
**** The kite path (red dots) is not fully accurate. I didnt realise until we did the fight its alot longer/little wider than I made in the picture.<br>
<br>
To visually show how this spreads the raid damage heres the WWS of our kill showing Illidans phase 2 damage: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304072427/http://wowwebstats.com/gwhpiv1asdic1?s=11030-12364&amp;bl=11163&amp;fia=29&amp;fiaa=a" target="_blank">Wow Web Stats</a>   <br>
<br>
Scrolling down, you can see the fireball quite neatly hit ~5-6 people per splash (in the same group). It looks like we had some bigger 7-splash hits with melee/tank/clipping another group, so i'll fine tune that next week. We ran with 9 healers and heres how I assigned the healing for phase 2:<br>
<br>
FR Tank 1 (Druid) = Paladin, Shaman, Paladin 2 (Dark Barrage Pally)<br>
FR Tank 2 (Warrior) = Paladin, Priest<br>
FR Tanks 1+2 = Druid, Druid (both lifeblooming)<br>
Raid Heal = Shaman, CoH Priest<br>
<br>
----<br>
Handling Dark Barrage:<br>
<br>
Dark Barrage instaheals= Both Druids and the raid healing shaman do Natures Swiftness/Swiftmend rotations. <br>
Dark Barrage Paladin = This Paladin will heal the FR Tank 1 for all of phase 2, except when a dark barrage comes. Then he'll immediately switch to heal up dark barrage and return to FR tank 1 once it ends. His job is to provide strong pally single-target healing to the barrage after the NS/SW initial heal lands. Because FR tank 1 has 2 other full-time healers (and lifeblooms ticking) they will be fine while this pally changes to barrage healing.<br>
Of course, that player being targetted must healthpot/healthstone as well.<br>
<br>
I love the suggestions players mentioned on using 4 groups and glad we took it on board. It makes CoH amazingly effective.  <br>
<br>
All in all its a great fight (Phase 2 and 4 mostly), but a small part of me likes the Archimonde fight more. The reason is, after ph2/65% on Illidan - I feel very safe for the rest of the fight that we'll kill him, barring a drastic mistake/error (Since we're all so focused for illidan, not many people make nub mistakes) . On Archimonde, we can be perfect but still spiral out-of-control in seconds at any single point in the fight - and that really keeps me on the edge of my seat the whole time.  <br>
<br>
Its great how Blizzard has designed the final two bosses of the current game.  Both require lots of concentration and co-ordination - have varying consequences for player mistakes - but go about it in different ways. The fortitude Illidan requires for a long ~20 minute session is what makes it epic, whereas Archimonde is epic for his exaggerated and brutal raid-wide punishments for small, individual player mistakes on a 6-9 minute fight. Illidan has a standout phase 2. The boss is above us, the raid is trapped - the eyebeam is coming up behind you, the blazes are everywhere, players are getting barraged for dirty amounts of damage, the raid is copping lots of fireball damage - it feels awesome and very exciting to he literally in the centre of all that. Definetely a fight design that does justice to a character of his calibre.</div>

Phase 2 movement and vent communication can be analyzed, as can the rest of the kill. Overall it was fairly sloppy and you can tell given the vent communication. But its pretty cool to get lucky with a fraps on a first kill and vent that late in the game, I guess.<br>

We went through many wipes before we were getting into P3 consistently with everyone alive. Once there though, its really just a matter of learning the mechanics, and not panicking. Melee are fine to run in and dps demons, but they MUST be spread out when the flame burst hits - and theres mods/timers to enable you to do this. Really its just a few simple rules to follow - spread out for flame burst / agonizing flames, and back up to give yourself room as hes casting the Shadow Demons.</div>

</div>For what its worth, we have all the melee form  big semi-circle arc around Illidan and move to the closest demon life-line when they spawn. This tries to help them avoid all choosing the same target and converging together.  We just told them: no more than 2 melee on a single shadow demon, if theres 2 on it - go find another one  (could say 3, but triple flame burst+ with agonizing flames ticking might kill you, so its a little risky). It  really shouldnt have a problem, especially when Deadly/Bigwigs give you the Flame Burst timer anyway.</div>

While its not a "free kill" like p1.. it really shouldn't take you long for players to get a grasp of the fight, see stuff with their own eyes and just.. not die.  No doubt you've killed Archimonde already.. survival is the most important thing.  After your first kill, you really shouldn't be wiping after p2 more than once every now and then.  Hell, if you look up several pages you'll see my post about a kill with Illidan getting a 25% heal from Draw Soul at 12%, and then an MT death (only prot warrior) at 15%.. feral druid tanking with some sheer dodging and sheared-enrage tanking.<br>

		<div id="post_message_583356">Have your warlocks casting SoC on Illidan around 2-4seconds before demons spawn, provided there is a frost trap/earth-bind totem close it should take a fair chunk of HP from all of them, if you have 4-5 locs you can even kill them all before the second flame burst (3-5sec after they spawn - so basicly they are insta-gibbed).<br>
<br>
Just remember to stay calm once demons spawn, dont panic or move your melee through the raid untill 3-5seconds AFTER they spawn when the flames have gone. It was fun when the warlock tank got a demon and several people all rushed in bravely to save her, and killed off a fair chunk of the raid in the process, never again.<br>
<br>
Just make sure you have a couple of people that can kill the tanks demon should it happen, standing closest to the front/near them (but not too close but the closest of your raid), sans its healer ofcourse.<br>
<br>
<br>
Remember, Morph -&gt; Flames -&gt; Demons -&gt; (3-5sec)Flames -&gt; Kill demons -&gt; Flames -&gt;&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
Also if you dont already, have all but 2 healers at the back of the raid so that you have close to all of your DPSers available to nuke incoming demons should it be required.<br>
<br>
<br>
To be fair Illidan is depressingly lenient once you are used to it, I cant compare to Sapph or Kel'T but I believe C'Thun was harder over-all once you had completed it, you had to stay ontop of things constantly or you WOULD get overwhelmed.<br>
Its sad how sloppy we tend to let things get nowdays, if that happened on C'Thun we would of wiped easily, but on Illidan it really isn't a huge deal if people die, or you get a small parasite infestation, or a group of people with agonizing flames etc...</div>

</div>Illidan falls over and begins to turn into his shadow form, hunters lay frost traps and shamans earth bind totems around him (depending how you tank him in phase 3 is how the positioning of traps and totems will be). I personally brought him to just a bit north of his original spot (towards the stairs you enter from) and moved him in a left and right pattern to generally keep him in the same area.<br>
<br>
Dealing with the demons is fairly simple, your warlock can be kept up by 2 paladins and any others you have can holy shock and exoriscm any incoming demons, have your classes that can slow targets down spread out. Shadow Priests, Hunters, Rogues, DPS Warriors, etc.<br>
<br>
My guild personally only ran with 3 rogues for melee DPS on the encounter the 2 kills we have had so that me be a huge plus, however spreading out and breaking up the melee you have is ultimately the best idea. Giving them all A and having them mark their own targets may work as well, so they don't all attack the same target.<br>
<br>
Remember healing is light during that phase, so if a healer is avaliable to add a mind blast or whatever they should be doing so. <br>
<br>
Remember to spread out, heal the people with the crashing flames debuff and don't freak out.</div>

		<div id="post_message_584729">If you are having trouble with Demon phase, have your mages spec Improved Blizzard and Permafrost and let them spam it when the demons are incoming (they are on a reliable timer). As they spawn the demons will be slowed down by 75%. While they are slowed have your warlocks use SoC on Illidan. Our warlocks reported that they had the chance to proc SoC  over three times while the demons were still in range of Illidan. Such a combination reduce their health significantly before they are even close to your raid and most times they just need to be finished off.<br>
<br>
Otherwise, there isn't much to the fight after Phase2. Keep spreading out, keep calm -- double+ Agonizing or triple+ Flame Burst are the only things that can kill you. A Parasite invasion is another concern. Frost mages are very good at killing parasites because they can nova and use shatter crits to kill parasites very fast.  Our mages are always on Blizzard duty in Phase4s and Parasite duty in Phases3. Between the two roles, there is hardly enough time to damage Illidan himself...but that is irrelevant as long as Demons/Parasites are controlled. Keep cool, watch your position. Spam the Main Tank, although he cannot crush Illidan still hits very hard. Make sure the 30% transition happens when your warrior is tanking. As for the enrages, we simply don't bother they are healable as long as you spam and your Main Tank can use abilities such as Dodge trinket / LS / Shield Wall / Insignia. If you have a Disc priest, you can use Pain Suppression which is also handy for the Dark Barrage in Phase2. Our MT survived without problems even without any cooldowns...Illidan will never one-shot the tank, you just have to spam heals in between hits. However, if a trap is close, just use it.'<br>
<br>
Illidan's enrage is one of these two:<br>
<br>
<a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?spell=41305" target="_blank">Enrage - Spells - World of Warcraft</a><br>
<br>
or<br>
<br>
<a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?spell=40683" target="_blank">Enrage - Spells - World of Warcraft</a><br>
<br>
The only two enrages with a cast time. Either way, they are healable and with decent DPS you shouldn't need to live through more than 2-3 of them.</div>

</div>It comes back to this: What makes more sense, having 2 people have to possibly avoid blue beams of death - or 23 people?<br>
<br>
I dont want healers in phase 2 to have to move or worry about beams at all, I just want them to spam the tanks/raid like crazy and concentrate on keeping the raid alive.  Another thing. is the benefit being close-knit in the centre has for maximising the effectiveness of chain heal/circle of healing. If you use 4point group strat (like us) COH is supreme. Spreading out too much (especially if you do it outside the grate) makes it harder to keep tight control of healing.</div>

</div>You dont really want to split your raid into the two blue-beam safe spots that far apart tho. Its much safer for 23 players and more efficient for your healing - to be grouped up all within chain heal/coh range of each other in the middle. If you split the range/healer component of the raid into the 2 safe spots on either side of the X beam paths - you have potentially 8-10 people getting hit by a fireball splash at a time. If your in the centre spread out/4 point, it might only be 5-6. Your not really getting more healing on the MT - your doing the opposite, because theres twice as much raid healing required - they might end up getting healed less (or people start dying from raid damage).</div>

		<div id="post_message_592876">Let me dig up a picture I made of P2.. Please ignore all the numbers and blue dots and such, it was made for a strategy discussion of ours. The essential parts would be the beam paths and the "safe" areas (red circles and purple bars across them). <br>
<br>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304072427im_/http://i25.photobucket.com/albums/c69/Nuveena/Strategy/IllidanP2_v2.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<br>
It is perhaps a bit hard to appreciate how tiny the safe areas between the beam paths actually are. For instance, it takes a fair deal of practice to actually locate the ones near "2" and "8". So, if you wanted your raid camp out of the middle, you would likely position the raid at the nothern green dot and nearby. But the question is, what do you gain by doing that? The two tanks would then have to share the middle area, where the circles overlap, leaving them with less space to work with, and your raid split in two locations, some of them likely having range issues. A shadow priest, for instance, couldn't reach the southern flame from the northern location.</div>

</div>I just dont see the benefits (tho im sure it <i>could</i> work if people really wanted to try it this way) . The circle grate and marking arounds its perimeter are the perfect visual indicators for positioning, especially given that much of your screen view gets obscured from fire/flames etc. Yeah , the tanks have a very crucial perfect-execution-or-die job in phase 2 with the blue beams , but if your guild is raiding Illidan your tanks should be up to handling this sort of responsibility. During phase 2 everyone in the raid im the centre is quite safe. The exceptions are the dark barrage once in a while and the 2 tanks who are always in constant danger. Changing the positioning to possibly put in danger a much larger amount of people wouldnt make sense.</div>

</div>Hmm, I have never spent time outside the circle but I thought that he never spit fireballs outside of the grate area, I was only proposing this on the idea that the gain would be essentially no raid damage during p2 at the cost of raid dps overall, however your post implies that is not the case.  Like i said, i knew there must be something wrong with this idea, i just needed to figure out what.</div>

As for demons, simply don't spread out in wide arc, it's better to have some people closer to boss, so demons will head in roughly the same directions. If your raid is covering whole 180 degrees around boss, range will be a problem. Also, you really limit the effectivness of your own AOE, which can take them out very quickly if they stay clumped.</div>

</div>The key for spreading out is really just experience.  When we were first learning the fight I didn't worry too much about spreading out in phase 3 since it's easily healed through, however I would periodically check to see if people were clumped up and verbaly warn them over vent when they were.  For phase 4 though, leading up to our first kill, I had the guild practice spreading out and coming back in and went around checking where people were and making sure everyone was spaced out enough from each other (about 8 yards).  All that can be worked on before you even pull and should help make people more familiar with the fight without having to wait and see if you make it past phase 2 or not.  <br>
<br>
For dealing with the demons what really helped us was effective AOE and slowing.  When he has 2 seconds till demons all the locks start spamming SoC and the mages start casting Blizzard.  One pretty much always has Imp blizzard so along with a hunter trap most of the time they are dead before the melee even have time to get up there.  The last thing is we use shadow priests as our first line of players (we usually have 3) to pick and single target them.  All in all it works really well for us.<br>
<br>
As for a basic order for phase 4 though we have Spriests in the front inside of MF distance, then we have warlocks and mages spread out around them making sure to be in rage to use blizzard and SoC, then healers behind them (except for the SR tanks healer), and finaly melee.</div>

<br>
Have everyone spread out into their positions prior to engaging.  Then your raid leader can make optimizations by making sure the healers are spread out, putting some good ranged burst damage up front, and making sure there's room for the warlock tank and healers.  Once you've found a setup that makes sense, tell everyone to remember it.</div>

<br>
i've just specced feral again, and as a feral druid, one of my tasks will be to tank one of illidans adds.  now i have some issues with my pcs performance, and im not sure if my pcs not gonna totally suck on fps when it comes to the add tanking, with all the animated textures of the flames, beam and so on.<br>
<br>
so my question is, how low can i set my spell details, without missing a blaze or a blue beam or standing in a blue beam and with my graphic details thinking im not getting damage (being killed) of it.<br>
<br>
and another question i have, is it sometimes even helpful to lower the spell details, because at most effects like the blue beam or blaze, the area in which you take damage is lower than the actual graphic effect. <br>
<br>
thank you guys in advance =)<br>

My guild just reached Illidan this week's run. We already got 3 nights on him and we still hardly pass P2.<br>

I m aware of the "tanking rules" for the Flames of Azzinoth (the buff pulse in a 20 y aura around the glaves) but i have still a question : <br>
<br>
Has anyone ever noticed this case : one flame charge the other flame's tank because they are too close from each other. This case happens for exemple when our tanks are both at the northest point of their kitting path. Is it because one of them got out of the "aura" or because there is another mecanism between those flames ?</div>

		<div id="post_message_594286">I typically run with horridly low FPS on nearly every encounter, especially those with lots of spells going off.<br>
<br>
During phase two, ill turn my spell detail to minimum to help my FPS out. This effectively makes it safer for me to inch to the very edge of the blazes without going too far because of terrible FPS. Outside of that, I find low spell detail ideal for this stage as well, as it gives me exactly the spots that are dangerous without the extra 'fluff' that is the cause for poor performance (fps performance).<br>
<br>
So yes, you can turn it down and see everything. Another boss, although OT that I find it useful for is the Dragonhawk boss in ZA. Seems like lower spell detail gives you a better estimate on where to stand (although easy anyways).<br>
<br>
I will usually use Ogre suits in phase two so that I have a 'seemingly' larger hitbox then normal, allowing me to hit the flames where others normally can't hit them. Our Tauren Enhancement Shaman on occasion will be hitting the flames when the orcs/trolls/uds can't. Mind you, I've only done this two times (on recent kills) and it might have just been me being a bit more reckless in trying to get as close as possible. Regardless, if it doesn't actually help in the way described, you at the very least look cool with a sick dance.</div>

		<div id="post_message_594636">Low spell detail helps in my opinion, on our first full night last night I turned it down midway through the evening and found it much easier. However, BIG CAUTION here as the spell detail effect on the eyebeam is slightly smaller than the range of the damage, so make sure you don't play with fire too much when dodging the eyebeams. On the blaze patches it is a major help. Good luck.</div>

</div>We were in a similar situation. We killed him within 2 raids (today) and most of the time was spent in P2 (but also a bit of time in p4 to avoid people dying from the volleys). <br>
However I do think Illidan is fine and that its Kael thats simply overtuned. I also dont think a 15min enrage timer would make for a fun fight and Id rather see some other way of increasing the complexity of the fight instead if its necessary.<br>
<br>
To add to the actual topic of the thread, we killed him using a 4camp phase 2 strat which was very beneficial and we had very few deaths/wipes because of the aoe damage.</div>

		<div id="post_message_600928">Just to echo the above two posters, such an anticlimactic fight in terms of difficulty, much like all of BT/Hyjal. Took us about 2 nights worth of attempts to kill him (although we had a 4% wipe after only about 4-5 hours of attempts).<br>
<br>
Part of the reason he's easier to learn than kael is the lack of trash. It'd take roughly 40-50% longer had there been the same amount of trash as kael has.</div>

		<div id="post_message_601154">My guild just came back from a 2-3 week raiding break from the holidays and managed to get Shahraz in 3 attempts, Council in 6 attempts (both on Thursday) and 1 night of attempts on Illidan for our first kill on Sunday.   The fact that Illidan is a fight that falls in the hands of P2 tanks, we basically got it down in less than 8 attempts (out of a total of 19 which took roughly 4 hours).   <br>
<br>
This thread was a huge help for a lot of things to cover.  This fight isn't necessarily as hard as kael, but that is also because theres less responsibility for the raid overall. <br>
<br>
For Kael you had legendary weapons that had to be used (clicking the staff wasn't hard, but making sure people were always in range was a real big issue).  For illidan, you learn a lot of the pre-requisites from earlier encounters.  After P2 was down, the only issue we had were people keeping their distance for demons.  I unluckily got 2 demons on me and died, but I was able to res up and just keep healing.   The biggest thing is you can pre-plan everything you want to do, before actually engaging, so we spent about 30 minutes doing some pretty retarded looking drills where I called out phases and people moved to their spots.  Once people got that down it became clockwork.<br>
<br>
The key things I can say attributed to our kill from this thread are:<br>
<br>
1) The diagram picture for phase 2 showing safe/unsafe spots - it is a very good reference point for tanks to start their learning from.<br>
2) Pre-planning your positioning before the fight.  It may seem tedious, but 5 yards is a small area and assigning people to a "reset" spot for phase 3 is easily one of the best ideas you can do.<br>
3) Seed of corruption on illidan right before he throws out demons - throw that with a snare and they are at around 60-70% before they even reach the raid.  Ranged can blow some cooldowns to kill 1-2 until the flame burst when the rest of the melee can just run in and clean up.   <br>
4) Phase 5 is basically utilizing your tanks' cooldowns based on how far the traps are.  For our first kill we had them laid out pretty easy, but we blew cooldowns just to guarantee nothing crazy happened.<br>
<br>
As most people have said, the hard part is getting to illidan but its also all in your P2 tanks.</div>

</div>We noticed a dwarf priest can't heal a gnome warrior tank in phase 2. Oddly enough, we seem to have had some issues with a human priest healing the gnome warrior too, but not as bad as the dwarf one.<br>
<br>
Night elf and draenei priests have no issues healing the gnome though. But lol, the dwarf -&gt; gnome thing was the cause of two wipes for us.<br>
<br>
Now I know, its not the exact thing as stated, but certainly think it is related. Also, I do believe Hortus said Taurens in tauren's form have a larger hit-box than tauren druids in kitty form. So, seeing as how undeads are smaller, I think that would explain why the orc got hit.</div>

		<div id="post_message_603118">We got our first kill last night after about 5 hours of total pulls and I did have one question after spending some time today reading through this whole thread. I noticed a lot of people making a big deal about traps and a few tanks commenting on having to blow SW/LS to get through enrages. My question being is was his enraged damage nerfed recently or something? We tanked him through 3 normal phases sub 30% on our kill (a few dps dead) and not once did we bother with a trap, they were all in some god awful place. I was healing the MT the entire time and I noticed he took hits slightly more often but the enrage damage to me at least looked no different than the non enraged damage.<br>
<br>
Just curious if it was nerfed recently because it didn't seem to make any difference weather or not he was enraged or not.<br>
<br>
Our MT profile in case it makes any difference. Buffed he was sitting at just under 22k HP. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302205705/http://www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Malorne&amp;n=Tfiws" target="_blank">The World of Warcraft Armory</a></div>

Illidan uses no specials, only auto-attack. He dual-wields. Enraged he will a bit harder but he will never one-shot the tank. So if healers are spamming the MT he should be healed between hits and should survive.

Unless the trap is close we don't bother and just heal it through. Tell your healers to spam and keep HoTs running.<br>

Enrage will also increase the damage done by Parasites and Agonizing Flames, so watch it. We usually keep a healer (usually a Shaman) in the back to heal Agonizing and Parasites.</div>

</div>This is incorrect, he will not always use Eye Beam right after he is done moving. It seems a bit random within a certain time-frame. He will sometimes even move twice before using it, though this is rare and I have never seen it happen before the third beam.</div>

My flame is getting dps'ed first and I really have time to see it all with a boss mod timer, unless there is a flame at mid/south at the start which is after 10-20 seconds of tanking.<br>
<br>
That's like the only hard obstacle and that's when I gotta move really fast,so you may just want to call the movements till the first one, after that it gets easier.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I'm sure this has been mentioned here before, but Hunter/Warlock tracking for Illidan during P2 is really nice. Pick someone vocal to call out where he's moving to. He pretty much always Eye Beams right after he moves. If you're looking at a standard diagram of P2 group positions, I may call:<br>
(Our tanks)<br>
<br>
"Illidan moving south (or north) of Valderath"<br>
"Illidan moving south (or north) of Temis."<br>
<br>
The tanks knows that when he stops, Illidan has a set path he will Eye Beam. It's the same everytime and he always does it right after he finishes moving. Plus it gives melee a heads up if they are on a tank's add to back out.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>We have our MT do this, since the MT really has no role in p2.  He calls out whose side Illidan is on, and if the beam is coming from north or south.  He also watches Illidan and you can see him begin to charge up a Shadow Barrage a second before it actually starts, which is additional useful feedback along with a bossmod timer.</div>

We only recently got Illidan down (2 kills so far) and everytime we try to put him in a trap it always screws us, either from healers not moving quickly enough or the warlock tank having to adjust and the raid not really picking up on it. Just continuing the fight from the earlier phases, ignoring the traps completely and just healing through the enrage has made things a lot easier.</div>

		<div id="post_message_606254">We killed Illidan in our ~30th attempt. I basically like the fight, but i think it i svery bad tuned. All his raidwide phase 3-5 abilities are a non-issue if you watch your range and deadly if you close the gap between two players. I personally think they should be tuned way harder for the correct range, and a little bit less heavy when 3 people are too close. There should be a problematic situation but not instant death. And i think the traps should play a far more important role. We just ignored them as they where in really bad places. The non-trap enrage should be an issue, atm its just safer to ignore them as this enrage is easily healable. They should fix trap positioning and then make the enrage really hard.

Basically, we keep the raid in a fairly narrow sector, but spread lengthwise. That way the demons will all run towards all of the raid, instead of having one go one way and another the other way. The timers on the Flame Bursts won't let you collapse at one point. Iirc, you'll have a burst just a few seconds after the demons spawn.</div>

		<div id="post_message_609466">This is quite scary, we had our first full night of attempts yesterday, and we have EXACTLY the same problems as Tactitus had. We are getting through phase 2 perfectly multiple times in a row as well now, we even also got him to 36% on our best attempt. The main problem we are having is Demons spawning, people running of to kill them immediately, getting hit by 5 Flame Bursts and dropping dead. Also the Warlock tank getting the Demon, but being way too close to Illidan with no time to kill the Demon.<br>
<br>
Tonight we will be going again, and we will be using a new positioning/execution for phase 4. The warlock tank will simply move back a bit when Demons are about to spawn, seeing as Illidan's Shadow Blast has a 100 yard range this should be no problem. This should give us more time killing his Demon if he gets one. The DPS will stay stationary 3-5 seconds after the Demons spawn for the Flame Burst to come and then nuke the Demons down. Ofcourse this doesn't make a lot of difference DPS wise, there will always be a demon the ranged can attack even while standing still. Its just the melee that has to wait a bit.<br>
<br>
Any additions/tips anyone can give me to this change?<br>
<br>
EDIT: Also another question I had, during phase 5 and enrages, he still transforms into Demon form right (not entirely sure of this in the first place, cant find it anywhere but still I remember reaiding about it)? Seeing a he can't be kited into traps when in Demon form, does this also mean his Flame Burst will do 50% more damage?</div>

		<div id="post_message_609477">We changed tactics as follows as we had the same problem as you have in p4. Everybody spreads out und is about 50y away from Illidan. When the demons spawn the first attacking them are shadowpriests and any ranged DD having range on a demon. After the SECOND flameburst the melees join in and finish the demons off. There is enough time between the 2nd and 3rd flameburst to kill the demons and therefore no need to hurry. To slow the demons we let our hunters place ice traps when he transforms into demon. It is (from my pov) very important that at least 1 trap is in direct line from Illidan to the warlock tank. I hope this may help you.<br>
As far as I know, he is not enraged in demonform. But the Agonizing Flames in p3 have their damage doubled making them tick for about 6k.</div>

		<div id="post_message_609559">When the demons are about to spawn, we take some steps back (in addition to being spread out and away from Illidan during his transformation), a team of ranged DDs (Elemental Shaman and Hunters work great) watches for Demon on the Warlock. As they spawn, they get some ranged AEs (traps and earthbind totem), then Melee teams finish them off (using Hamstring and Crippling Poison to keep them at a crawl). The demons are usually down before the second AE, and even if they aren't, the fact that we use teams on each demon has never cost us high casualties (as far as I remember, 2 or 3 people since november).</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">This is quite scary, we had our first full night of attempts yesterday, and we have EXACTLY the same problems as Tactitus had. We are getting through phase 2 perfectly multiple times in a row as well now, we even also got him to 36% on our best attempt. The main problem we are having is Demons spawning, people running of to kill them immediately, getting hit by 5 Flame Bursts and dropping dead. Also the Warlock tank getting the Demon, but being way too close to Illidan with no time to kill the Demon.<br>
<br>
Tonight we will be going again, and we will be using a new positioning/execution for phase 4. The warlock tank will simply move back a bit when Demons are about to spawn, seeing as Illidan's Shadow Blast has a 100 yard range this should be no problem. This should give us more time killing his Demon if he gets one. The DPS will stay stationary 3-5 seconds after the Demons spawn for the Flame Burst to come and then nuke the Demons down. Ofcourse this doesn't make a lot of difference DPS wise, there will always be a demon the ranged can attack even while standing still. Its just the melee that has to wait a bit.<br>
<br>
Any additions/tips anyone can give me to this change?<br>
<br>
EDIT: Also another question I had, during phase 5 and enrages, he still transforms into Demon form right (not entirely sure of this in the first place, cant find it anywhere but still I remember reaiding about it)? Seeing a he can't be kited into traps when in Demon form, does this also mean his Flame Burst will do 50% more damage?</div>

My guild found it helpful to use raid marks on our meelee.  This made it easier for them to be aware of their positioning relative to each other, to avoid zerging the same demon and subsequently dying to flame burst.</div>

		<div id="post_message_611062">I learned this fight (tanking at least)  after having killed him numerous times as a priest so I knew the ways we had wiped in the past and had idea's on how to avoid it already.  I almost think it would be better to watch videos of wipes because of the flames instead of full kill videos.  <br>
<br>
The way it was explained to me was kite from triangle to triangle (they are inside the big circle by the pillars) in a slightly rectangular pattern.  Avoiding eye beams was my first priority (since typically the person to yell at people when they screw this up).  After that it was moving in a kite path without toasting my raid.  Then working on building aggro (they dps'ed my target second since we had a more experienced tank on the other add).  Finally I worked on reducing my overall damage, this meant working on moving as little as possible while still getting out of the blazes as quickly as possible.  <br>
<br>
Also having people call out the eye beamsis a huge help, especially while learning.  I wasn't very experienced as a tank in general when I was doing this so maybe my tunnel vision is a bit worse but you have a lot to think about while learning this fight.  <br>
<br>
After having done it a few times now I can see why people consider it simple but there is a lot to think about when you start and if you try to do it all at once it's going to be bad.</div>

		<div id="post_message_611925">Ok guys I do have a question about melee DPS on this fight. We've been killing Illidan for about 2 months now and we did not have  a single fight that a melee DPS tops the meter. Then by checking some WWS reports (will list below) I saw that some guilds do have rogues/fury wars topping it.<br>
We (melee) DPS him on Phase 1, Phase 3/4/5 while in Human form. Phase 2 we swing a couple hits on the Flames but there's no notable damage.<br>
Are we doing something wrong? I mean we know what are we doing, we do have a good gear, we make use of spreadsheets and stuff, we pump out everything we can to do a good amount of damage, so I wanted to share with you guys what is possibly happening.<br>
<br>

		<div id="post_message_612021">Short kills lend themselves to melee topping the meters.  We had exactly 1 demon phase the entire fight in the wws you linked, meaning they were on the boss most of the time.  We focus my add down first and it dies before it drops it's 5th ring of fire on the ground.  For reference I pick it up, run as far south-east as I can and I'm about directly ontop of the warglaive when it dies.  Then the melee switch sides and usually kill the other add before our other tank runs out of room in his area.<br>
If your raid doesn't have that kind of dps then your p2 tanks will likely be out in the middle of no where and the melee will around around doing nothing for long periods of time.  <br>
I have no idea how many demon phases you would have in a 16m fight but that is certainly a lot of time spent standing around doing nothing.</div>

		<div id="post_message_612032">You shouldn't declare as a general rule that melee shouldn't hit the Flames in Phase 2...I mean, sometimes it won't be an option but most of the time melee DPS will be able to get to at least one Flame.  If you're farming Illidan then obviously you're doing well, but given the spacing/movement requirements for most of the fight melee should be coming out on top.</div>

Also we had 3 Demon Phases wich means too movent, too spreanding for Flame Bursts blablabla. I will try to work that out with my guildmates. Thanks for the tip guys.</div>

		<div id="post_message_612712">I can sometimes top damage on Illidan but it all depends on how many Demon Phases we have or how long I get to DPS one of the flames. It all depends on your guilds strategy with the Demon Phases (ours just have melee sit back) and the luck you get with the eye beams on the Flames. Regardless, the melee can top the meters on the fight, or should be damn near competitive (unless your guild doesn't allow melee on the demons and the fight is like 20-25 mintues long). Shorter the fight, the more the melee will tend to Dominate.<br>
<br>
If you're in melee range you will not be targetted with Agonizing Flames. Our MT is a Tauren and he has been targetted with Agonizing Flames, but I believe this is because the ability can target whoever is 1st on threat regardless of if the target is in melee range or not. If this wasn't the cause then you would see Tauren Enhancement and Tauren DPS Warriors get agonizing flames more often.<br>
<br>
<br>
Agonizing will definetely slam your melee if you aren't in melee range. I don't recall the exact circumstances, whether it be backing out for a MT parasite or the MT dying, but all four of our melee did get Agonizing flames (because they were all standing together). So the rules for the ability to me dictate that if you're #1 on threat or not in melee range then you can get agonozing flames.</div>
