    * Fire Nova Totem: This totem has been replaced with a new spell, Fire Nova, which is available at the same ranks as the old Fire Nova Totem. Existing characters will automatically learn this new spell in place of the totem. With a Fire Totem active, shamans will be able to use Fire Nova (fire magic) to emit the same area-of-effect damage as the old Fire Nova Totem from the active Fire Totem, not consuming the totem in the process. Fire Nova will activate a 1.5-second global cooldown when used and has a 10-second spell cooldown. The caster must be within 30 yards of the totem to use this ability, but does not need to be within line of sight of the totem.<br>
<br>
Elemental Combat<br>
<br>
    * Improved Fire Nova Totem: Renamed Improved Fire Nova. This talent now provides an additional 10/20% damage to the spell and reduces the cooldown by 2/4 seconds.<br>
<br>
Glyphs<br>
Shaman<br>
<br>
    * Glyph of Fire Nova Totem: Renamed Glyph of Fire Nova. This glyph now reduces the cooldown of Fire Nova by 3 seconds.

</div>To add to this, it can be brought down to a 6 second cooldown with 2/2 Improved fire nova talent and further reduced to 3(!) second cool down with the glyph. I can see that being extremely useful in any PvE fight with adds, however the 1073 mana cost is rather daunting.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I'm not sure honestly how this fits into our rotations given what we already have.  As it is, I really don't have any spare GCDs floating around, ever...and Fire nova is going to do comperable dmg to the totem, so we're talking an instant cast 1400-2k dmg at most.<br>

My opinion is that it's completely useless in single-target dps fights because any/all our other abilities will be prioritized above it (I'd even refresh lightning shield before casting this honestly, particularly with 2-piece T9).

		<div id="post_message_1409662"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Since I know people are going to ask about it and I was curious myself, Fire nova math:<br>
<br>
945 average base damage, coefficient will be 42.86%<br>

My gear is less than perfect, but using it as a baseline because it's essentially tier gear with ulduar stuff.  2153 total spellpower with raid buffs, or 922.7756 extra damage for nova.  45% spell crit raid buffed.<br>
<br>
If it doesn't get Call of Fire and no talents/glyph:<br>
<br>
(945+922.7758)*1.13=2110.59 with 45% crit = 3060/10(cooldown) = 306 dps<br>

With Call of Fire:<br>
<br>
(945*1.15+922.7758)*1.13=2241.88 with 45% crit = 3251/10 = 325.1 dps<br>

With just Imp Fire Nova:<br>

Raid buffed and in combat I'm floating around 3000 spellpower which means it should do about 2100 non-crit and 2520 with 2/2 Imp Fire Nova Totem.  5k crits makes it seem like it would be a button worth pressing, especially if there was more then one thing getting hit.

</div>Except you're assuming you also keep a fire totem down all the time...so now you HAVE to keep magma totem up all the time (most of the time I do, but there are occasions where GCD makes that dicey depending on how bursty my crits are with maelstrom).  My shocks hit that hard, the math for lava lash with the totem I believe will be higher than that (I'll have to do the math to double check) and my CL for sure hits harder than that, and SS is important for mana retention.<br>
<br>
So again, it does hit fine, granted, but I'm still unsure how high a priority it really becomes.<br>
<br>
You could perhaps use searing instead of magma at a relatively minor dps loss there to then free up a frequent GCD for the nova spell...that could work.  It also then to make it that effective requires you to get imp fire nova totem though, which is now giving up two points elsewhere...not sure where you could effectively pull those points from to get it.<br>
<br>
More math...gotta check imp shields with T9 bonus vs. imp nova totem...it SOUNDS like imp nova may edge it out, not sure though...and while mana isn't an issue now...spamming fire nova on a shorter cooldown might make it an issue.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Hopefully they will change the glyph to give it back the stun instead of reducing the cooldown since I'm not sure if any spec of shaman can maintain Fire Nova totem on a 3 second cooldown or even if they would want to.  Meaning the glyph really doesn't have any value as just a cooldown reduction unless people were willing to reglyph for specific fights with heavy AoE components.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Lava lash still nets you an extra flametongue hit.  People are also under the assumption that talent multipliers affect the end result of the spell, but they affect the base.  Look at fire nova totem for example, the tooltip reads 893-997, factor in the 15% from call of flame and you get 1026.95-1146.55.  Look familiar to your ingame tooltip of 1026-1147?  Same deal with concussion and the spells that it affects.  The average damage for Fire Nova with the talent will be ~3370 and the average damage of a Lava Lash with the FT hit is ~3170.

</div>No it would simply mean that you couldn't cast Fire Nova if you didn't have magma down and so the priority would simply be use FN if MT present. ie: if its not present the priority simply falls through to the next in the list same as all the other priorities we have. <br>
<br>
FS isn't shown as priority if FS debuff still on target. So FN wouldn't be shown if we didn't have a fire totem down. Simple.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>The BiS talent build is only BiS when you have 4-piece T9, so I should have qualified...I only have 2-piece so far, not 4-piece so BiS talent doesn't yet include the reduced shock cooldowns (there's discussion I think in the last 5/6 pages of that thread about it) which means I get more benefit from mana return from imp SS than reduced mana of my shocks.

I am well aware that the BiS setup is only BiS with that (or comparable) gear.  Notice how I'm not gemming haste right now. It's not based on T9 2pc vs 4pc (BTW you will probably find that 4pc t9&gt; 2pc/pc). I personally ran with 0/2 imp SS even in 5/5 t8.5 and had no issues with mana.

</div>Such a macro isn't possible the game cannot make decisions based on whether a previous spell has been cast. You must make that decision. Of course what is and will be possible is for an addon like ShockAndAwe to display FN icon as available and the highest priority to use. We shall of course need some testing to know where if anywhere in the priority list this should go but I shall add FN to ShockAndAwe in the meantime.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>The closest you could probably get would be a cast sequence with Magma totem as first in sequence and then as many Fire Novas as you can fit inside the magma timer. The quantity obviously varying depending on whether you talent and/or glyph fire nova.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
#showtooltip<br>
/castsequence reset=combat/alt Magma Totem, Fire Nova, Fire Nova, Fire Nova<br>
<br>
The sequence will reset if you drop combat or if you use the alt key to manually reset it. Otherwise it will allow you to cast magma totem followed by 2 nova's (20 second magma totem allows you to use nova twice during its duration). If you talent for the 4 second reduction you would add a third nova to the sequence depending on your latency/reaction time. Glyphed you could potentially get 6 novas depending on your latency/reaction time.<br>
<br>
I don't like adding a time out to reset (20 seconds?) because of how those timers work with spells and cooldowns. For example, if you use a 20 second reset timer, drop the totem and fire nova only once, you will have effectively put a 21 second cooldown on recasting the totem. In this example that's not that extreme, but if you look at the talented or glyphed example where you have 3 nova casts you get the following situation. Cast MT, Cast FN, Cast FN. At this point you have used FN twice, your sequence has one more FN cast available, Magma totem has less than 12 seconds left on its duration but the reset timer is ticking down from 20. So if you never use the third Nova you have a seven second window before the macro will reset to MT. Add in the glyph and things really get nasty, 5 casts of nova leave you with 4 seconds remaining on the MT and 20 seconds until the reset happens. So if you miss that 6th Nova cast you got a hell of a long wait before the key is useful. <br>
To compound the issue, if you press the key while nova is on cooldown or when a fire totem isn't down to trigger the ability you will reset the timer and stay on the step that failed to cast potentially prolonging the reset of the macro even further.<br>
You can of course use the combat and alt/shift/ctrl modifier options to force the macro to reset. But if you have to manually reset the macro pretty often then you might as well drop the timer completely and just use a manual reset any time you don't step all the way through the macro (my obviously biased opinion).<br>
<br>
<br>
If you like the idea of a reset timer go ahead and add it. It's personal preference. I hope the above is clear on what to expect and how to plan the macro's design and usage should you have a reset timer.<br>
<br>
Edited to clarify. I assumed this macro would be used primarily in an AOE only situation where you would be prioritizing Fire Nova over all other moves (3 to 5K damage on 4+ targets? yes please). This macro would not work all that well with a priority rotation like what enhancement uses. In that situation you probably want to use a timer (like the nice ones built into shock and awe) to show if you have magma up to use FN.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I would assume that is by design. Fire nova totem and magma totem do not proc EF. The new nova spell is a hybrid of a standard spell and a totem. It's worth a bug report on the ptr forums. <br>

</div>Depends really on how you want to use Nova. As a filler cast last in the priority order, you're not going to need the glyph at all, could likely put only 1 point in the talent and wouldn't be surprised if you got by with none without it interrupting anything. Really, the only use for 3 second nova spam would be trash. In any boss fight, you'll go OOM too fast for regen and it would clip too many of your other more damaging attacks.<br>
<br>
At the same time, in my experiments using it as filler on the PTR I found that with mana totem and 1 point in IMP SS I had no problem getting through a 1 minute SR cooldown without going dry.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic"> People are also under the assumption that talent multipliers affect the end result of the spell, but they affect the base.  Look at fire nova totem for example, the tooltip reads 893-997, factor in the 15% from call of flame and you get 1026.95-1146.55.  Look familiar to your ingame tooltip of 1026-1147?</div>

</div><br>
<br>
I think it's a perfectly valid assumption to make given that Call of Flame most definitely applies to the end result of the spell rather than just the base damage with at least Magma Totem.<br>
<br>
I've just tested this on the PTR.<br>
<br>
Here's what I did:<br>
<br>
1) Made a pre-made level 80 Draenei Shaman.<br>
2) Went to a level 60 dummy in Stormwind.<br>
3) Removed all my gear and ensured I was untalented and was on 0 spellpower.<br>
4) Auto-attacked the dummy to put myself in combat to ensure that Recount would show results.<br>
5) Dropped a Magma Totem.<br>
6) Using Recount I saw the min/max/average ticks of the Magma totem across it's 10 procs.<br>
7) I then got out of combat and equipped 2302 spellpower (the default set you start with).<br>
8) Cleared Recount, re-entered combat and dropped another Magma totem.<br>
9) Recorded the new min/max/average at 2302 spellpower and 0/0/0 talents.<br>
10) I then exited combat, removed my gear and specced 5 points into Convection and 3 points into Call of Flame.<br>
11) At 0 spellpower again I re-entered combat and dropped another Magma totem.<br>
12) Recorded the min/max/average of the ticks.<br>
13) Exited combat, equipped 2302 spellpower and then re-entered combat and dropped another Magma Totem<br>
14) Recorded the min/max/average etc.<br>
<br>
Results:<br>
<br>
At 0 spellpower and 0/0/0 spec the Magma Totem did 371 per tick. Exactly as per the tooltip.<br>
<br>
At 2302 spellpower and 0/0/0 spec the Magma Totem did between 601 and 602 per tick non-crit and 901 and 902 crit.<br>
<br>
(This btw gives a coefficient per tick of 0.1)<br>
<br>
At 0 spellpower and 8/0/0 spec the Magma Totem did 426-&gt;427 per tick non-crit and 639-&gt;640 per tick crit.<br>
<br>
At 2302 spellpower and 8/0/0 spec the Magma Totem did 691-&gt;692 non-crit and 1037 crit.<br>
<br>
<br>
Analysis:<br>
<br>
371 * 1.15 == 426.65. <br>
i.e. We can definitely see that it's at least increasing the base damage by 15%.<br>
<br>
601 * 1.15 == 691.15.<br>
i.e. We can *also* see that it's not just boosting the base damage by 15% but *all* of the damage.<br>
<br>
Conclusion:<br>
<br>
Call of Flame, at least for Magma Totem boosts all of it's damage just as the tooltip would suggest, not just the base damage.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now maybe Fire Nova is different (still need to test some of those things) but for Magma Totem at least, you are incorrect.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I think the reason you're not seeing any effect from call of flame is simple. Fire Nova is not a totem (not any more anyway), its a spell that has a totem requirement. The tooltip doesn't list the fire nova spell so I wouldn't expect it to increase the damage the spell does.<br>
<br>
It may be that blizzard does want Call of flame to effect the Fire Nova spell but in changing the mechanic of the spell lost the association to the talent. It's another worthwhile bug report to get clarification on the intention of the change.<br>

		<div id="post_message_1416781"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->The 4pc bonus is very interesting from an itemisation and rotation perspective. As a shaman that uses a haste build, I find I am able to stack up my MW extremely quickly, and frequently find myself accidentally using another ability in my rotation because the MW jumped suddenly from 2 stacks to 5 and I didn't have time to react. At the same time, given how zerg the rotation and how quickly MW can stack, I often try to 'predict' the 5th MW proc by casting LB at 3/5 stacks when my ES and SS are on CD. This often fails, meaning that I am not hitting 5 stacks; something I will have to avoid when T10 hits. <br>
<br>
It is difficult to say at this point how this change will affect itemsation given that we have not yet seen the amount of haste and ArP on T10 level gear, but I think it is safe to say that haste will become an even more potent stat for us than it already is. Measured against this however is the Fire Nova totem change, an ability that scales based on our SP. If Nova provides a decent DPS boost in a normal rotation, the value of the extra SP might outweigh the value of more MW procs. The same could be said of Flame Shock, the value of which is still yet to be definitively determined. <br>
<br>
Finally, we are yet to determine if this 4pc bonus has an internal cooldown, something that would significantly impact the value we place in the bonus.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Given it's low(ish) proc rate, at least compared to most of the procs we've seen in WotLK, I'd guess that it doesn't have an ICD. <br>
<br>
Regarding these bonuses, I'm pretty excited about them both. They give us two new mechanics that we haven't had before. Compared to something boring like extra damage on a certain ability, I look forward to these. I'd also imagine that blizz doesn't like us casting LBs with anything but a 5 stack, so from a design perspective, they're trying to push us in the direction they want from us, though that's purely speculation. The SR bonus should prove interesting to balance, depending on how mana intensive Nova will be. It might also prove very nice to wear 2 piece in pvp.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1417042"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I cannot answer the first couple of questions asked above, but the one with Nova over WF seems like WF would still edge out on top, as far as the other glyphs it might top out over Feral just because you get more usage during fights, if you use it in your rotation. If mana is a concern how about using it only when SR is up or being used. Or you could just use it on still or limited movement boss fights when Fire ele out. <br>
<br>
   This does look very promising, but to get the full effectiveness from the new spell you'll need to rethink how your spec, gear, glyphs and Cds work, anything shy over that will show and yield very little if you go "half way" with just spec or glyphs.<br>
<br>
 As for the loss of a stun in pvp... that's really only an Ele concern. And even that, if partnered right with cc or snares can be fixed with extra damage from the new spell while they are stuck near said totem until they take it out, or get away from it. Earthbind would be wonderful with this if done right.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I do find it interesting, timing Shamanistic Rage with a speed potion and/or trinkets could provide a nice dps boost, but Blizzard is bringing the main issue of Enhancement PvP into PvE (Only damage reduction cooldown is also only way to get back mana, besides Water Shield) and forcing us to use it for damage, and not for survivability or longevity, I may find myself speccing Imp.

This should be roughly a 3% damage boost (12% with 25% uptime) but at the cost of our survivability and longevity, while the Death Knights get a 3% boost to all damage with a 100% uptime and at the cost of nothing.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1417250"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Agreed. We're a little squishy yet as a melee class, and I've grown very fond of SR as a tool for "damage inc!" survival (focus fire on HToC Champions, certain phases in Beasts). That said, as far as mana regeneration goes, I have no issues with popping it on cooldown. It won't always be ideal, but repeated real-world tests with built-in timers (a la Anub hard mode) suggest that I go OOM at about the same points in every fight, and typically have plenty of time to spare on the cooldown, so even a non-ideal placement would be all right.<br>

</div>Except that we're not being forced to use it for damage.  Yes, it's a nice boost, but in a boss fight where you would otherwise do 6,000 dps, popping SR on every CD brings you up to 6,180 dps.  I'd say that it's nice, but not critical to our overall effectiveness in boss fights.  On the contrary, we should consider that T10 content bosses will most likely deal enough damage, or else have enough periodic, high-damage abilities, that saving SR for those moments will increase our dps, by virtue of living to do more damage.<br>

</div>Assuming a patchwerk-like fight, if LB continues to be our highest-damage ability (which I think is a safe assumption), then I'd say that the timing of SR would ideally allow as many MW5_LB as possible (say, immediately prior to MW5_LB).  Once EnhSim can incorporate the T10 set bonuses, it should be easy enough to determine where SR should fit.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I think that may be pushing it a little far as it stands now. If I use Shamanistic Rage on cooldown, I never have mana problems. I simply never dump 100% of my mana pool in 1 minute. Fire Nova getting higher in our priority list may change that of course.<br>
<br>
The survivability question is another issue completely. However, if I'm going to need it in an encounter, I typically know before hand, and thus can plan on saving it without too much trouble.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1417760"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I'm not sold on the idea of putting Fire Nova in the priority list. I see it as Blizzard's way of giving us some added aoe damage, which we are lacking. Magma totem and the rarely used Fire Nova totem are our only true aoe abilities. Magma totem does not hit for that much, mine personally will crit for ~1500. Looks at other classes. Warrior has Bladestorm/whirlwind, Rogue has Fan of Knives (almost spammable), Mages - pick one, etc. All the other main dps classes have very nice aoe spells/abilities to call one for multiple mob pulls. I think Fire Nova is there just to bring us in line with other classes for aoe damage.<br>
<br>
Shaministic Rage - It only has a 1 min cd. No need for imp SS with the shortened cooldown. As Beercow stated, you will know before a fight if the boss has a phase that may require the damage reduction as so you will time you SR uses accordingly. And being a shaman, you control the Hero/BL, and can converse with RL/other shamans on when the hero/Bl will be used to plan accordingly. The 12% damage bonus will be very nice. Would be nice to test to see if it will stack with other damage buffs; Unleased Rage comes to mind.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1417786"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->SR has a defensive application in every ToC(heroic) fight, and I don't expect that to change with Icecrown due to Blizzards model of harder being make things hit harder/faster/stronger and upping the gib factor on things.  I can only assume that it was paired with SR to allow us an actual burst cooldown since our dps is largely a constant, otherwise they could have just tacked it on to shocks with an "every time you shock you gain 3% damage for 9 seconds".  It's just a crappy scenario where our one and only defensive cooldown becomes our one and only offensive cooldown.  Yeah, yeah, you could argue it should be a choice of that, but if the rogue set bonus were something similar along the lines of "your cloak of shadows also increases all damage done by 12%" the tears would be endless.<br>
<br>
If they wanted to be super cool they would make it "Every time you cast hex you gain 12% damage for 11.25 seconds, regardless of target immunity".  It would keep the basic idea of a 3% damage increase and not sacrifice our survivability to do so.  The downside would be eating a MW stack or hardcasting it and suffer the autoattack losses.  All around it seems like a better option than hit harder or die faster(a dramatization).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1418166"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->My initial reactions to our T10 set bonuses were positive, I do have a few thoughts/concerns though. I like the two set bonus because it means I would finally have a short cooldown damage increase ability for fights were you need to do more damage at given intervals. The drawback to this as some people have already mentioned is that it is our primary (or only if you use the Reverb build) source of mana regeneration as well as an effective damage reduction tool. On some fights I'm already saving SR for when some sort of raid damage goes out and not neseccarily using it at every opportunity to regain mana. So with this two piece bonus SR will have three competing uses instead of the current two. How big a problem this will actually be depends on the IC encounters and in how many of them you would want to sit on SR to reduce damage taken or do more burst damage at some point in the fight.<br>
<br>
My initial reaction to the four set bonus was that we may no longer want to use 4MW LB and 3MW CL(LB) at the bottom of our rotation since it means we hit five stacks less often when we would otherwise. The proc itself is certainly nice, I'm concerned that there may be an internal cooldown but given the low proc chance I don't think there would be. I would also think as some have already pointed out that this four set bonus encourages a haste build to some degree. This seems like the direction we're going already (maybe Blizzard is trying to tell us something?) so I don't find that too terribly problematic.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1418387"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I don't want to add too much speculation here, but my own personal guess is that the Shamanistic Rage set bonus is Blizzard testing the waters for a potential future talent.  Blizzard has mentioned in passing their general interest in getting a little more defensive play in DPS (it was a GC post a little while ago).  They've already fiddled with a few DPS survival tools that sacrifice damage in WotLK (Deterrence, Enraged Regeneration, Feint, etc), and I suspect they may try to move all DPS in that direction eventually.  So I personally like the idea behind sacrificing some (but not too much) damage for survivability as an intelligent choice, but I agree with the poster above me that it feels a little stretched in Shamanistic Rage with its triplet function.  If I am right about the future then it may feel less clunky if the mana functionality is removed when Enhancement Shamans are modified in lieu of Hunters not having any mana in Cataclysm.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1418438"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Sorry to stray off topic but I recently went on the PTR to try out incorporating Fire Nova into my rotation. ShockandAwe works fine on the PTR so I was able to reproduce my rotation on a targeting dummy pretty well. I wasn't spec'd into Improved Fire Nova nor did I have the Fire Nova glyph, I was just using the baseline 10 sec CD Fire Nova with the spec I'm using live. I incorporated Fire Nova into my rotation just above Lava Lash in priority because I assumed Fire Nova would out damage Lava Lash. Where Fire Nova was to go into my rotation wasn't what I trying to figure out it was just an assumption I operated under for the time being and I wasn't terribly concerned with its ideal placement in a rotation just yet.<br>
<br>
Anyway, what I noticed was how quickly I was going oom. Normally I can use my normal rotation on a targeting dummy without any kind of mana regeneration buff other than Shamanistic Rage and do my rotation indefinetly. Using Fire Nova however I went oom very very quickly. Even when I starting using Water Shield and Mana Spring Totem I went oom in a very short time. Even with only a 10 sec CD the mana cost on Fire Nova is incredibly restrictive. I realize that in a fully raid buffed situation I'm going to have replenishments and an increased mana pool but even so I can't see integrating Fire Nova into our rotation (or even begin to think about using a 6 sec CD Fire Nova for that matter) unless the mana cost gets reduced or we change our spec for increased mana efficiency.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1418452"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->JoW, replenishment and your larger mana pool make a very large difference to your mana efficiency, and don't forget that you will have even more mana in T10 gear (likely at or over 19k). My initial tests on PTR indicate that Fire Nova fits comfortably into a hasted rotation if you put it under LL given how often we are casting LB. If we moved it up above LL, I am quite certain that our mana pools will be able to sustain it. Either way, we should be using it in the event of all other abilities being on CD- we would certainly have the mana for this at least.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

 what we should be doing, and by no means using a premade shammy on the ptr, (use your main) is testing the possible specs and glyphs then add in what increases you would get from potential gear upgrades.

</div>It is always possible that they want you specced into Imp SS and increasing our mana consumption rate is their way to accomplish that.  In any case the spell is as the spell is and it's mana costs are not something we can negotiate.<br>
<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100210144638/http://www.wowarmory.com/talent-calc.xml?cid=7&amp;tal=05303005200000000000000003020501310502133303113123105100000000000000000000000000" target="_blank">The World of Warcraft Armory</a><br>
<br>
Gets you 2/2 Imp Fire Nova and all the important talents including Imp SS.  Comparing that build to a build with 4/5 reverb and 1/3 Imp Shields shows a loss of about 75 dps on the Sim with a normal rotation.<br>
<br>
Fire Nova should do at least as much damage as Lava Lash with 2/2 Imp Fire Nova and 3/3 Call of Flame.  Lava Lash when used every ~8 seconds is worth close to 370 dps according to the sim.  If you can sustain the mana with Imp SS then it should be a significant dps increase to use that build over the Reverb build even considering the 370 figure is inflated as there will be dps loss from trying to fit in the additional GCDs.  Also keep in mind that the 75dps is including 4T9 so using Imp SS and Imp FN should become an larger dps increase as we move out of 4T9.<br>
<br>
<br>
Edit - Just did 10 minutes on a targeting dummy with the build above.  Used mana spring and lightning shield and SR at about 2-3k mana and had no issues at all sustaining a "rotation" with Fire Nova.  Ended up using Lava Lash and Fire Nova about every 11 seconds, Earth Shock about every 8 and Lightning Bolt about every 7.5 seconds (so it was definitely sloppy with room for improvement).  Fire Nova hit for 1967 average and crit for 4110 with a 30.8% crit rate.  Lava Lash hit for 1267 and crit for 2564 with a 53.8% crit rate; just to put the damage into perspective<br>
<br>
Really liking the spell, can't wait to get to use it on live.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>You would have to pick up the two fire nova talents which would drop reverb to 2/5 instead of 4/5.  Right now, it seems that with the t9 4 piece bonus ES is essentially equal to or more important to use than Stormstrike.  That will change when you no longer have the set bonus and thus it would seem to become less important to have those 4 talent points put into Reverberation.  It would make more sense to put those two extra points in Imp SS or even another dps talent like Improved Shields.<br>
<br>
At that point, I almost wonder if it would be much simpler to do a SS - FS - LL - FN - SS - ES - LL - FN rotation: you would have two free cooldowns for shields, wolves, rage and mw_lb every cycle and your FS would at worse only get 5 of 6 ticks per cast.  Trying to squeeze in another shock would seem to complicate things immensely.  <br>
<br>
You aren't the first person to state that the Fire Nova ability does roughly the same damage as Lava Lash.  The real question I imagine is would 2 FN every 16 seconds do more damage than one extra shock every 16 seconds?  I would have to say it would.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Pretty sure its been stated time and again that as long as you get 5 of the 6 ticks of the FS dot in, its better than Earth Shock.  Also, please take not that I did not insert MW_LB into any part of that dps cycle.  And in all honesty, you are only kidding yourself if you think you are a special and unique butterfly when it comes to DPS cycles: even a seemingly random rotation has a lot of hidden order in it.<br>
<br>
A benefit of building your dps series around a few fixed points is that it does allow for an enormous amount of flexibility.  At any time in that cycle, you can throw in a MW_LB, Lightning Shield, Shamanistic Rage, Spirit Wolves or Magma Totem and still have time to 'catch up' on the next series.  It could go something like this:<br>
<br>
SS - MW_LB - ES - LL - FN - MW_LB --- SS - ES - LS - LL - FN - MT --- etc<br>
<br>
Without the benefit of the 25% bonus shock damage from the t9 set, ES_SS will fall below SS in the priority list.  Assuming you plan on spending two talent points in Fire Nova for the added damage/reduced cooldown, you will not have enough (if any) points placed into Reverberation to justify throwing in two shocks between each and every Stormstrike use.  Getting two FN casts off every two SS casts will yield you higher overall damage than getting only one extra Earth Shock off in the same rotation: the cooldowns simply do not align themselves for such an occurrence to happen!<br>
<br>
But do not take my word for it:  log onto the PTR with a premade and see for yourself!<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Actually MW3/4 is a sort of self-fulfilling profecy - if you watch for it, you will consume MW charges with it and you'll get to MW5 less often. Using spells with cast times comes with side effects too (you can be interrupted, spell locked and you can't move as freely). Personally I am still on the fence on whether in the real world it's worth it or not. Oh well the point is becoming moot soon anyway.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>For well over a year now, we have operated with a priority, rather than a rotation.  By advocating a fixed rotation, even when you grant the ability to impose SW, SR, MW, LS, and totem refreshing into it, you're saying the best practice for optimal dps is a standard cast sequence.  We avoid this for the same reason we avoid a /castsequence macro.<br>
<br>
In part this is a paradigm conflict.  For a death knight (which your profile says your main is), the dps cycle depends on rune cooldowns.  All 6 runes have the same cooldown, so the optimal behavior has to accomodate that.  Do a bunch of stuff to put all your runes on cooldown and build runic power, and then dump runic power.  If you plan ahead what "stuff" to do, you're better prepared.<br>
<br>
Unlike a death knight's, shaman skills don't share the same cooldown.  Further, you're underestimating the frequency and importance of the maelstrom weapon proc.<br>
<br>
Try creating an enhsim combatlog output.  As you say, the spells used by the simulator to emulate perfect execution of a priority create a sequence of casts that can look a lot like a rotation.  Maelstrom weapon and other high priority casts interrupt or reset that rotation.  It turns out this happens, both in simulation and in game, a lot.  Whenever this happens, I could mentally reset my rotation, or recognize based on what's currently on cooldown that I'm now in a different place in my rotation.<br>
<br>
So we have 2 different ways of thinking of the same behavior.  By Occam's Razor (or Gardan's Steelyard), I prefer the simpler approach.  When something comes off cooldown, use it.  If more than one thing is available, use the better one.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
As was stated above and more importantly Enhance is run off of RNG. MW, WF, LS and soon to be increased damage off MW... are all "chance on hit", so a rotation would never work b/c of the randomness of said abilities which are most of your top end damage when you check the meter on most fights. If we weren't so random then yes by all means we'd have a "set" rotation.<br>
<br>
The only thing that can be  confused with a rotation is that when you first engage the boss, you drop totems and hit SS, then either ES or LL (depending on set bonus and relic choice) after that is ALL RNG with refreshing your totems and LS as well as keeping your debuffs on the boss<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Magma totem is capped on the PTR as well so it seems as if Blizzard closed that "loophole".  Appears that all AoEs will be capped in the same manner based on the PTR notes, Max possible damage up to 10 mobs and decreasing proportionally from there.  So if you don't see it as an amazing AoE buff keep in mind that all AoEs will be affected the same way if you are hitting that many mobs.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I believe the point they are trying to make is that FS is better than ES by a small margin when you execute perfectly. Small mistakes (which are very easy to make) not only cost you the DPS increase but actually result in a loss of DPS over just plain old ES spam. ES spam might be lower DPS in the sim but in the real world it's at least dead even but often better and simpler, freeing you to pay attention to the encounter mechanics/purge spam/etc.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Only if you get every tick of the DoT.  Lose a single tick and Earth Shock ends up being more damage.  That is the problem.  Flame Shock glyph is better then say Lightning Shield or Windfury if you get every tick of the DoT but not by a significant margin.  So if you lose a tick then that specific Flame Shock wasn't worth casting and if you don't cast that Flame Shock then the glyph wasn't worth using as opposed to the alternatives.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I think what they're getting at is that if you're near the end of the DoT and your shock cooldown is up and you need to shock, then you either a) clip the DoT tick which means the previous Flame Shock wasn't as effective as an Earth Shock would have been or b) use Earth Shock and delay your next Flame Shock by several seconds and nullify a portion of the benefit of the glyph, which could make it inferior to the other glyphs.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Pretty much.<br>
<br>
My perspective comes from my combat log parses.  When I started playing around with Flame Shock it was looking like a nice dps increase.  Only problem was that the first log I looked at was a Koralon one which is ideal for FS.  So it was looking like an upgrade to use the Flame Shock glyph instead of Lightning Shield so I swapped it in.<br>
<br>
At first I was using a castsequence macro with Flame Shock so it wouldn't clip but it would be used frequently without my having to think about using it.  Checked my parse for that weeks 25 man raids and the glyph and rotation were costing me potential damage compared to having used Lightning Shield glyph and only Earth Shocking.  So I pulled the FS glyph and started only FSing when I was sure of getting all ticks from the DoT.  Checked my 10 man parses and that ended up being a dps gain over just Earth Shocking but not a very significant one.  Also if I had used the FS glyph it would have ended up being less damage then I gained from the LS glyph.<br>
<br>
I compared FS glyph to LS due to mathematical simplicity but the findings should be relevant for WF glyph as well since the sim has them both worth roughly the same amount of dps.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Edit:  Sorry, being clear this is from an enhance perspective, not elemental...I don't know enough about elemental to have an opinion on that.<br>
<br>
I'm not sure honestly how this fits into our rotations given what we already have.  As it is, I really don't have any spare GCDs floating around, ever...and Fire nova is going to do comperable dmg to the totem, so we're talking an instant cast 1400-2k dmg at most.<br>
<br>
My opinion is that it's completely useless in single-target dps fights because any/all our other abilities will be prioritized above it (I'd even refresh lightning shield before casting this honestly, particularly with 2-piece T9).  On the off change I have a spare GCD, sure, I'd hit the button, but I don't think that'll really ever happen.<br>

It IS kinda cool for AoE fights, granted, and gives enhance shaman some much needed AoE boosting in that departement.</div>

</div>So then as long as you're effectively tracking your dot (which the new SAA does nicely), you're free to FS if you don't have a debuff up, regardless of your glyph choice. In this way we err on the side of an extra ES in between FS casts (so FS-ES-ES-ES-FS instead of 2 in between) with no damage loss, and potentially a slight gain. <br>
<br>
Personally I've been using it only on less dynamic fights that I can focus on my rotation more, and otherwise just ESing. Since it's not glyphed I don't have to worry about using an extra ES<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

That is, 20% of my AP, 15% chance - lasts for 10 seconds.  So if mw5 appears every 10 seconds then the AP bonus is just AP x .2 x .15.  If it comes up every 20 seconds the cut that in half (so 10 /t).<br>

So if I have 5k AP and MW5 comes up every 20 seconds this is like a 75 AP bonus - not that thrilling.<br>

That is, 20% of my AP, 15% chance - lasts for 10 seconds.  So if mw5 appears every 10 seconds then the AP bonus is just AP x .2 x .15.  If it comes up every 20 seconds the cut that in half (so 10 /t).<br>

So if I have 5k AP and MW5 comes up every 20 seconds this is like a 75 AP bonus - not that thrilling.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Pretty much.<br>
<br>
My perspective comes from my combat log parses.  When I started playing around with Flame Shock it was looking like a nice dps increase.  Only problem was that the first log I looked at was a Koralon one which is ideal for FS.  So it was looking like an upgrade to use the Flame Shock glyph instead of Lightning Shield so I swapped it in.<br>
<br>
At first I was using a castsequence macro with Flame Shock so it wouldn't clip but it would be used frequently without my having to think about using it.  Checked my parse for that weeks 25 man raids and the glyph and rotation were costing me potential damage compared to having used Lightning Shield glyph and only Earth Shocking.  So I pulled the FS glyph and started only FSing when I was sure of getting all ticks from the DoT.  Checked my 10 man parses and that ended up being a dps gain over just Earth Shocking but not a very significant one.  Also if I had used the FS glyph it would have ended up being less damage then I gained from the LS glyph.<br>
<br>
I compared FS glyph to LS due to mathematical simplicity but the findings should be relevant for WF glyph as well since the sim has them both worth roughly the same amount of dps.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>Aye, I agree that the FS glyph has generally not been worth it in my calculations as well.  However, to your previous post, I do show that FS does more damage at the 5-tick mark rather than needing all 6.  You definitely still wouldn't want to clip though.<br>
<br>
After normalizing average damage for crits, I get the following averages:<br>
<br>
Earth Shock:  3834.89<br>
Flame Shock (unglyphed):  [4 ticks] 3782.61, [5 ticks] 4306.63, [6 ticks] 4830.65<br>
<br>
I did not account for Concussion, Earth&amp;Moon/Ebon Plague/CoE, or Fero. Insp/Sanc. Ret. as they affect both ES and FS the same as far as I understand.  I did account for the crit meta and I used SP of 2956 and crit chance of 44.8% which were my averaged raid stats (including averaged trinkets, blood fury, and berserking procs over their proc rate) before a recent change in leg armor.<br>
<br>
This seems to follow what I've seen in Recount, but I do not have a hosted log to go over at the moment.  Is this significantly different than what you're seeing?  Perhaps I made an error somewhere.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>What could you possibly be doing wrong that your MW5 would take 20 seconds to stack?  Looking through some parses my average stacking time is ~7.5 seconds.  I walk into a raid encounter with 6700 AP buffed.  With procs and UR I've seen spikes to almost 10k AP.<br>
<br>
Averaging out my procs and multiplying them by 1.1 for UR,  I average ~8200 AP during a raid.  With a 7.5 second stacking time that works out to 328 AP which is ~210 dps.  Considering T8 and T9 bonuses were each worth around 150-180dps this is looking like it will be a very nice set bonus.<br>

</div>Your math looks similar to mine but my average ES was significantly higher then that.  Doubt it's due to gear differences so maybe it is due to SS uptime?  Did you include the SS debuff into your ES numbers or are you just trying to compare it when SS is missing from the target?<br>

</div>Your math seems fine, but your assumptions are way off. As Rouncer mentioned, you're going to get to MW5 significantly faster than 20 seconds. Additionally, once you reach that gear level, you're going to have way more than 5000 AP in a raid buffed environment. All and all, this is a really fabulous set bonus. The only side effect is Haste is probably going to gain a lot of worth.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Soulstone by comparison can easily be used on the "wrong" person (if they don't die) and Rebirth can't be used at all if the druid dies. In some ways, Reincarnation is the only cooldown that you are guaranteed to see every fight as soon as it becomes that dependable.</div>

		<div id="post_message_1427312"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I'm still a bit on the fence in regard to Fire Nova.  I've been on the PTR and I tried it out.  I didn't use the +20% damage talent in my dummy tests, but I compared my self-buffed numbers on Fire Nova vs some week-or-so old 25-man raid parse numbers.  With a quick glance, it looked to me like the self-buffed un-talented Fire Nova damage was about equivalent to Lava Lash + Flametongue Weapon, which would lead me to believe that given raid buffs, Fire Nova would surpass Lava Lash.<br>
<br>
Although, if you use ToQE, you'd have to consider LL for keeping the Volcanic Fury buff up, and then there are also fight mechanics to consider.  Movement intensive fights wouldn't fit well with Fire Nova.  Yet again, there are also fights in which you may prefer Fire Nova because of the multi-mob capabilities (Anub'arak).<br>

</div>I'm not understanding why you say it's going to be superior when the duration and cooldown on both totems facilitate around a 100% uptime (it won't truly be 100% for either totem due to the ramp-up required).  The only benefits I see the elemental totem providing are a speedier ramp-up (10-12 seconds vs 16 seconds) and there may be a fight in which the Enhancement totem's stack falls off because of the fight's mechanics.  The only fight in which I can see this occurring currently is Icehowl during his Massive Crash which also depends on your luck in whom he chooses to charge.<br>

</div>Both take 3 attacks to stack to full.  1 haste rating is roughly equal to 2 AP for most people.  Shocks are ranged attacks that allow you to keep the stack active even if you can't be in melee range due to mechanics of the fight.  The elemental totem will also last 30 seconds while the stormstrike one will only last 15 seconds.  All those things add up to why it is vastly superior.  Think about it this way, if you lose the stack even once during a fight the elemental one is better since it takes less time to restack and with the elemental one you are also far less likely to lose the stack in the first place.<br>
<br>
If the elemental one ends up requiring 5 shocks to stack to full then it would be equal to the enhancement one but otherwise there isn't a single reason to choose the enhancement one over the elemental one.  Which really isn't such a bad thing anyway since you always want to be using your shocks unlike what happens with the current elemental totem.

</div>I understand and agree that the Elemental one is the "safer" totem because of the longer duration.  Although, when I saw the totem information, I tried running through fights in my mind seeing if I could notice fights where I had extremely long melee downtimes and the only one I could come up with that I think we'd definitely have an issue with losing our stack would be Icehowl.<br>
<br>
Now, ToC fights are all nice and dandy, but we're talking about a T10 totem here anyway, and with that, we'd like to compare it to T10 fights, which I assume we all will try and focus on more.  The only fight we have any information on currently is Marrowgar.  The big issue with Marrowgar is his Bone Cyclone move.  The point of this move is to get away from him (similar to Stormcaller Brundir's Lightning Tendrils) and we all know that this means we will most likely lose our Enhancement totem's stack.  It may be possible, if Blizzard doesn't change the bleed mechanic, that melee may be able to stay in the whirlwind and continue to DPS, but not all guilds may allow this and as mentioned, it may not be viable come the final release of 3.3.<br>
<br>
So I think it might be good to keep a sort of "running tally" of which totem is more viable.  If we find that a significant number of Icecrown Citadel fights favor the Elemental totem because of fight mechanics, it might be worthwhile to bring up the buff duration to Blizzard.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Changing it to only Flame Shock would stop shaman of every spec from trying to use it.  Clipping your flame shock dot is a significant dps loss for both elemental and enhancement so elemental would just stick to their T9 totem and neither spec would really even think about using it.  They could link it to LvB though but then elemental would probably just stick to the T9 totem since it isn't linked to an ability with a cooldown so it already has roughly a 100% uptime with a minimal delay on the initial application.  Best option, if they wanted to prevent Enhancement from using it, would be to just change it to spellpower, 85 spellpower stacking 3 times.  <br>
<br>
As for the totems themselves, let's break it down a bit further.  Shocks are 6 seconds, stormstrike is 8 seconds and you can apply your first shock while you are moving into range.  Then there is the duration difference to take into account and finally there is the ability to keep it active even if you are forced out of melee range.  The only advantage to the enhancement one is that AP may have a slight EP advantage depending on your gear.  My current EP for haste is 1.96 so that breaks down to 9 EP versus those other advantages.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1427944"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Yesterday I finally got a chance to get onto the PTR and play around with Fire Nova and I must say... its a cool spell that fills the large void of aoe potential that Enh shamans have gotten so used to. However as a result of it I have been doing alot of thinking lately of haste vs ap stacking in the upcoming 3.3 patch. <br>
<br>
Alot of us currently are Haste stacking once we get the gear to produce roughly 22% haste as I have found myself that at that point this method sims slightly higher or the same as my previous AP stacking, and when I do my EP I find my haste above 2.0 EP so I know that with more gear and haste I will produce faster dps than before. But because of Fire Nova already hitting for about the same on 1 target as Lava Lash, and it producing about equal damge to 2 targets as our shocks. What happens to the our priority queued rotation at 3-5 targets? <br>
<br>
I would imagine that we will find a rotation as such will produce far more dps than our standard single target rotation (MT,FN,SS,FN,MW,FN,ES,FN,MW,FN,SS...........) This is of course with a glyphed fire nova and it would have to be proven with simming at some point, but truly like every other aoe class their is a certain number targets required before you basically go balls out on aoe to produce higher dps. 25m Heroic Anub'arak is the perfect example of this, and If enh shamans had that spell today I have a good feeling we'd be using the fire nova glyph and the rotation above while the adds are up for that fight. <br>
<br>
So, back to the haste question, because we all know that Blizz will have alot of fights with multiple targets to dps, should we just say screw haste stacking as it produces little to no extra dps with a aoe rotation or perhaps its time for us to build 2 gear sets, one with ap stacking for an aoe environment and one with haste stacking for single target dps? It would be interesting to know how much extra dps is provided by haste stacking on a single target with our BIS gear setup for 3.2 vs just ap stacking. Currently I'm at work (lol) but when I get home I will answer my own question.<br>
<br>
Just some food for thought.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>While it would be a DPS loss to clip Flame Shock, isn't it already a DPS loss to activate the current design of the totem because I assume Elementals would use Earth Shock twice after the initial Flame Shock to activate it?  <br>
<br>
I think some Elementals might actually like the totem more if it were Spellpower.  Although some people may not even upgrade to the T10 totems for awhile since they aren't much of a difference, and we have no idea if T10 will be purchased the same way as T9.<br>

</div>I can say that I am in no way trying to say that the Elemental totem doesn't have advantages over the Enhancement one.  Although, some of these advantages are either very small (shorter ramp-up time) or they aren't necessarily an advantage unless the fight mechanics cause them to be.  I mentioned that Lord Marrowgar already provides a fight where the Elemental totem is better simply because of his Bone Whirlwind.<br>
<br>
Although, in regard to haste EP...  I'm not sure if you read MMOC any, but we've been talking a bit about haste's EP calculations in EnhSim and how at times they can be inaccurately portrayed by inhuman reactions, etc.  Levva had a couple good posts describing a few of the issues.  I created a graph of haste's EP values from 0 to 30% in .5% steps that will give you a good idea of what I mean:<br>
<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100109193115/http://i93.photobucket.com/albums/l51/shin_aikouka/haste_0_30.png" target="_blank">http://i93.photobucket.com/albums/l5...haste_0_30.png</a><br>
<br>
Note that these were calculated while I had 4/5 T8 and now I'm in a tad bit different gear that could result in a slightly different looking graph.  The script that created each EnhSim file did take into account melee haste as well as spell haste in the proper ratio.<br>
<br>
I'm mostly looking to get a "windfury-viable" weapon speed when fully buffed (including Flurry) and I have to take my haste into account when doing that.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Frost Shock actually, due to Booming Echoes (more damage + shorter cooldown on Frost Shock). The problem is, both Frost and Earth Shock only have a 25 yard range, which again pushes us elementals closer to boss. It doesn't matter much, since a lot of us are already using Searing Totem (20 yard range) these days, but it does make one wonder what the devs are thinking.<br>

</div>You do realize that Windfury has nothing to do with the haste fluctuation, right?  Windfuries cooldown has been proven to be variable around that 3 second mark such that there can be no fine tuning for that specific cooldown.  The easiest way to think about the cooldown is as if it was 3 +/- 0.2 seconds and that is how the Sim attempts to model it.<br>
<br>
Personally, I have never seen the haste EP values that other people talk about and I have tried changing all my gems in rawr to haste and various other things in an attempt to inflate it's value.  I think this is for a very specific reason that I really haven't had time to validate as of yet.  I am an engineer so I use hyperspeed accelerators for my glove enchants and that has been a constant in all my testing of haste's EP values.  So every minute I get a large infusion of haste rating and that seems to level out my haste EP values to show more realistic numbers.  Haste is still showing a very large EP value but just not over the value of AP and I think those values I am getting are validated by the Sim since using a gemming priority of AP or a gemming priority for haste is giving me basically the same results.  <br>
<br>
Following is Rawr exports of my current setup into EnhSim 1.8.4.1 and then ran for 10k hours for 10 min combat samples with default Rawr buff setup.<br>
<br>
Current Gear - Prioritizing AP<br>
5022 AP<br>
426 Haste Rating<br>
8166.15 dps <br>
<br>
Prioritizing Haste (keeping hit at same level just swapping AP for Haste)<br>
4702 AP<br>
586 Haste Rating<br>
8166.47 dps<br>
<br>
Pretty close, which is why I stick to AP stacking since AP affects Magma totem so AP stacking should be better if Magma totem ends up hitting more then one target.

				<div style="font-style:italic">You do realize that Windfury has nothing to do with the haste fluctuation, right?  Windfuries cooldown has been proven to be variable around that 3 second mark such that there can be no fine tuning for that specific cooldown.  The easiest way to think about the cooldown is as if it was 3 +/- 0.2 seconds and that is how the Sim attempts to model it.<br>
<br>
Personally, I have never seen the haste EP values that other people talk about and I have tried changing all my gems in rawr to haste and various other things in an attempt to inflate it's value.  I think this is for a very specific reason that I really haven't had time to validate as of yet.  I am an engineer so I use hyperspeed accelerators for my glove enchants and that has been a constant in all my testing of haste's EP values.  So every minute I get a large infusion of haste rating and that seems to level out my haste EP values to show more realistic numbers.  Haste is still showing a very large EP value but just not over the value of AP and I think those values I am getting are validated by the Sim since using a gemming priority of AP or a gemming priority for haste is giving me basically the same results.  <br>
<br>
Following is Rawr exports of my current setup into EnhSim 1.8.4.1 and then ran for 10k hours for 10 min combat samples with default Rawr buff setup.<br>
<br>
Current Gear - Prioritizing AP<br>
5022 AP<br>
426 Haste Rating<br>
8166.15 dps <br>
<br>
Prioritizing Haste (keeping hit at same level just swapping AP for Haste)<br>
4702 AP<br>
586 Haste Rating<br>
8166.47 dps<br>
<br>
Pretty close, which is why I stick to AP stacking since AP affects Magma totem so AP stacking should be better if Magma totem ends up hitting more then one target.  True, the same type of argument could be made regarding Chain Lightning in haste's favor since it should stack Maelstrom Weapon faster.</div>

</div>I do agree that the intermittent 2.0+ Haste EP that people are getting before they sim over 30% haste is a product of the sim and I haven't yet seen any evidence of in game logs of people that get exactly X amount of haste to produce significantly high % of WF procs. <br>
<br>
However with the WF IC of 3.0 +/- .2 you can easily argue that as you approach 1.0 weapon speed via haste (I know this is impossible to sustain atm) you should see a higher % of your hits produce WF procs. This alone supports stacking high amounts of haste in order to produce higher than 2.0 haste EP's when your haste is over 30%. Notice that in the BIS gear thread the config has 21.46 melee haste but their also using the Totem of Electrifying Wind which is roughly another 7.5% haste. with a 85% uptime according to the sim. As a result I would argue that this is why the BIS gear thread was not able to produce the highest theoretical numbers with gemming AP but instead with Haste. In patch 3.3 this will be even easier to obtain with a 95% uptime relic giving 219 haste rating.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I just read through this thread and I didn't see any tables or charts that consolidated all the information into one data set.  So, the +/- .2 is not a confidence interval but more of a rule of thumb.  I would say that this still means that there will be a lull in windfury procs when approaching 3, 1.5, 1 etc weapon speeds.  It might be hard to conclusively pinpoint what this cooldown is and how it affects us, but I would say that the best solution is just to stay away from multiples of 3.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>There isn't anything for two handers either.  My initial reaction was that "dagger" was a blanket term for 1h and "slow melee weapon" was a blanket for 2h.  It doesn't make a whole lot of sense that a dagger would have a runic power gain on it seeing as Death Knights don't even know how to pick them up.<br>

Conversely dagger could blanket fast and slow could blanket.. slow.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>This is the stuff I don't like to see, you are just randomly making up values and then stating how something will actually work.  Lets try this with real values.<br>
<br>
Using the BiS set and changing the race to Orc and both weapons to the 258 axes so I can push the haste gemming as far as possible I get a set with 5419AP and 957 Haste Rating.  Regemming for an AP priority changes it to 5839AP with 546 Haste Rating.<br>
<br>
Haste set runs 9138 dps with the ToEW and AP set runs 9134 dps with ToQE.  Haste set fires off a 5 stack LB every 6.2 seconds and the AP set every 6.6 seconds.  <br>
<br>
So Haste build gets a proc every 40.9 seconds and AP build gets a proc every 43.6 seconds, making the average AP<br>
<br>
haste build ~ 265 AP<br>
AP build ~ 268 AP<br>
<br>
Look at that, almost the same amount of AP from that bonus.  Seems like those who want to stack haste will still stack haste and those who like to stack AP will still be stacking AP.  Maybe Fire Nova will change things one way or the other. So if you want to start working on the math for that, be my guest but try to use realistic values and not just random ones pulled out of thin air.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>This is news to me. Furthermore, I cannot remember any circumstances where I have spent 20 seconds without the buff, even at the beginning of the encounter (granted, I often use MW3/4_LB at the beginning of an encounter to get the buff up quickly). To my best and most accurate knowledge, the ToEW is still BiS for anyone stacking haste.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Using the BiS set and changing the race to Orc and both weapons to the 258 axes so I can push the haste gemming as far as possible I get a set with 5419AP and 957 Haste Rating.  Regemming for an AP priority changes it to 5839AP with 546 Haste Rating.<br>
<br>
Haste set runs 9138 dps with the ToEW and AP set runs 9134 dps with ToQE.  Haste set fires off a 5 stack LB every 6.2 seconds and the AP set every 6.6 seconds.  <br>
<br>
So Haste build gets a proc every 40.9 seconds and AP build gets a proc every 43.6 seconds, making the average AP<br>
<br>
haste build ~ 265 AP<br>
AP build ~ 268 AP<br>
<br>
Look at that, almost the same amount of AP from that bonus.  Seems like those who want to stack haste will still stack haste and those who like to stack AP will still be stacking AP.  Maybe Fire Nova will change things one way or the other. So if you want to start working on the math for that, be my guest but try to use realistic values and not just random ones pulled out of thin air.</div>

</div>Yes, and the moment a second mob enters the fight, your ping isn't absolutly perfect and/or you don't have inhuman reaction time, the AP build will clearly win.

</div>By what margin does haste beat AP stacking for your particular gear set?  I've run my gemming prioritizing haste and prioritizing AP and they have been coming up with the basically the same dps figures for a long time now.  Just now I traded 300 AP for 150 haste rating in my Rawr set and my dps out of EnhSim didn't change.  One thing that does change though is that when I use that haste gem set I lose 8 dps from Magma totem.  So if magma totem is hitting more then 1 target the AP build will end up superior, which is why I continue to prioritize AP.<br>
<br>
EnhSim has also just been updated with an option to vary combat length within a specified percentage while running and I think this is going to change some things about the EP values that people are getting as well as potentially redefine the BiS set.

</div>I don't believe his comment was about magma totem dps, more so than adding fire nova dps to the equation.  Obviously, in any multi-mob situation attack power ends up being a better stat for us to stack due to SP scaling.  If past raiding instances are any indication of future trends, you can logically expect there to be many more multi-mob fights to come in future raiding instances.  If the AP builds are almost as good single target dps, then it would be wise to advise most players to simply stack AP and only work on having a haste gear set for the truly hard core dpsers.<br>
<br>
Perhaps the sim should include a multi-target option with an uptime % of adds for us to play around with.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>This is a missing feature often overlooked by those who swear by the haste dps gear. In our current sim we have only ever had Patchwerk style fights. <b>The sim has no simulation of any movement.</b><br>
<br>
This means any fight where you aren't 100% behind the boss, or you aren't always in melee range, or you have to move away, or you are sometimes stunned, or you have multiple mobs, or you are subject to environmental AoE damage (that would proc LS), etc. ANY of these fight conditions change the dynamics of some of our abilities.<br>
<br>
I would hazzard a guess, and to be fair its only a guess, that haste based gear whilst fabulous for Patchwerk is probably not nearly as good for any fights with any of the additional mechanics listed above.<br>
<br>
I have submitted an issue that suggests we try to implement a boss model feature. The problem is that the existing Sim really isn't flexible enough to handle this as any model needs to be very user tweakable as theorycrafters would naturally have to come up with parameters for each fight.<br>
<br>
Therefore a realistic aim is NOT to try to model bosses in EnhSim but instead model it for the next program. We will have a dramatic sea change in stats in Cataclysm. To me it makes sense that when the beta first appears and we have some solid info that work begins on a new Sim, using the all new stats we shall have. eg: no mana for a start <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100109181446im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":)" class="inlineimg"><!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1438229"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Opp topic here as we have more fitting threads for discussing EnhSim but what the hell. <br>
<br>
Movement fights, several targets, different lengths(which I personally think isn't sorted by the length deviation patch) are all issues that <i>can</i> be addressed with the sim but do we want the sim to try to do everything? 10 minute fights, two or more adds in large portions of fights, moving for X% of Y% fights are all pollutions of the simulated, perfect DPS. If these new features in EnhSim 1.10.foo.bar skew people to weird choices because fights are mashups created by the simulator it's rather doing harm than good. We know a speed enchant for boots is the better choice if you move some during a fight. I would also like to add the resent trend of doing 10 minute combat length runs to this misconception; how many fights last for ten minutes these days? Ten minutes of actual combat that is.<br>
<br>
I'd see the value of adds, variable combat length and movement if we could make fight templates that EnhSim would repeat over. Something like:<br>
<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px">
	<div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom:0px"><img src="/web/20100109181446im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/chestnut/misc/code_html.gif" border="0"></div>
	<pre class="alt2" dir="ltr" style="
		margin: 0px;
		padding: 3px;
		border: 1px inset;
		width: 694px;
		height: 162px;
		text-align: left;
		overflow: auto">&lt;combat_round alt=1&gt;
   &lt;length&gt;360&lt;/length&gt;
   &lt;adds length=60&gt;2&lt;/adds&gt;
   &lt;movement&gt;20&lt;/adds&gt;
&lt;/combat&gt;

&lt;combat_round alt=2&gt;
   &lt;length&gt;600&lt;/length&gt;
&lt;/combat&gt;</pre>
</div>And let EnhSim repeat these templates as actual fights over and over. You may even flesh out parameters to the different variables, like when adds are introduced in the fight, when you run and for how long and so on. Question is, do you want The One Result To Rule Them All? Or do you want to test the different parameters separately to see how your stats work out?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Would you rather have a simulated, perfect DPS number, or a number that better matches the real world? I personally use simulators to improve how I perform <i>in game</i>, not for the sake of maximizing some number in the simulator itself. I applaud any move to improve the simulators to model realistic combat situations, in realistic environments.<br>
<br>
Also, Rouncer, you have definitely convinced me to have another look at an AP build.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Just make sure to use the newest version of the Sim and set the combat variance length to 35% or so.  Using the new variance system should stabilize your haste and give you real results on how it will interact with your gear.  <br>
<br>
Personally I've never seen the massive overvaluing seen by others, it's a great stat but just hasn't been showing for me as any more valuable then AP.  This is most likely due to my being an engineer and so using the Hyperaccelerators.  That insertion of a large amount of haste on a somewhat regular basis has roughly the same effect as using the variance system.  Making it that much less likely to hit a region where the priority list will change enough from the haste to suddenly allow an additional usage of a higher priority ability within the set time period of the sim.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Pretty much, but if you have evidence for a more accurate setting I would be happy to recommend that instead.  Would seem for purposes of dealing with haste that just about any variance should remove the issue with priority shifting but 35% seemed as good a number as any I could think up. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100109181446im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/kirby.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":kirby:" class="inlineimg"><!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1439553"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Not sure why you want need to run the sim LOTS of times. Isn't that the same as running with a longer simulation time? You should keep in mind though that what you want to find is not necessarily the value where the dps stops changing. Looking at the example you refer to, it's logical to assume that the dps increase from 0% variation to 35% variation is caused at least partially by the increased chance to benefit from 2 full bloodlusts. At a 35% increase/decrease, this chance has already gotten pretty close to the 50% value, and something else might affect the dps negatively the same way.<br>
<br>
I mean, once the variance gets high enough, isn't it quite close to running a 10000 hour simulation with a fight length of 10000 hours? The point of the fight length variable is to simulate as close as possible to a real fight. The point of the fight length variance is to make sure haste/weapon speed/whatever doesn't get an inflated value due to fitting in one more of a specific spell. A value much lower than 35% (probably 5 or 10%) is more than enough for that.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Note that even though a haste set stacks to 5 charges faster the AP set gets more actual AP from the bonus such that there was no advantage to either setup in a single-target patchwerk type encounter.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Actually it should be more like a gcd every 45 seconds since it would be refreshed by that last DoT tick and last 30 seconds from that point.<br>
<br>
Wouldn't be surprised to see them change it to a 3 stack being applied by Lava Burst in light of the Resto connection but I guess that depends on whether they have an issue with all 3 specs wanting that one over the ones designed for their own trees.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>You are right, spending a GCD every 45 seconds (due to long DoT) isn't that bad, although you would want to recast FS with maybe 15 seconds left on the buff in case you get a resist.

</div>There's a big difference between making a mistake and having 3+ mobs on the screen.  One is user error and the other "just happens" and we have no control over it.  <br>
<br>
By modelling as though no mistakes are made it gives us something to aspire to.  Whereas if we model as though mistakes are made, then how do we determine what mistakes are normally made?  What if I don't make those same mistakes every fight? Hell, what if I play perfectly that fight?  Then the sim values mean nothing and I've potentially gimped myself.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>This will my last post on this subject in this thread, since I think we've gotten way off subject. I suppose my ultimate point is I'm happy to see a sim move in the right direction by attempting to model real world scenarios, environments, and encounters. I'm not saying it should model my mistakes, since I'm also striving to be a better player in general. But our current top end raid (hToC) doesn't have a patchwerk-like encounter, so it seems silly to use such an encounter as the basis for a sim. I don't have the perfect solution, but I can recognize that the small changes (like variable combat length) are moving us in the direction of a better sim overall.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Boss fight mechanics (from the perspective of melee dps) amount to various ways to implement certain factors:<br>
1. Some of the time I'm not in contact with an enemy.  I might be running away from something, or running toward something.<br>
2. Some of the time I'm not attacking from behind and might get parried and dodged.<br>
3. This is a lesser point, but sometimes I am attacking an add that is less than boss level.  My hit and expertise combat stats will affect this combat differently.  Level-based spell resist will happen differently.<br>
<br>
What the sim does, is tell me what my dps could potentially be, while I am in position.  If I know or estimate that I will be out of position 15 seconds out of a 6 minute fight or whatever, that doesn't affect the behavior the sim should try to model while I'm actually where I'm supposed to be to most effectively do my job.<br>
<br>
As a dps player in a raid instance, you have to be flexible enough to succeed when boss fights become very complex, but your primary job remains to kill a boss.  The simulator we use is designed to model your behavior when you are doing that -- killing a boss.  It's then up to us to be smart about how to use the data it gives.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I think that this is what people really need to keep in mind. It's a really good thesis statement for sim work in general, at least I think so.<br>

That said, I think what people are trying to address with all these "extras", is that some stats, and I'm looking at haste in particular, are only good when we can sit behind a boss continuously.

</div>The Enhancement totem only requires 16 seconds to apply the three stacks as it only takes 2 Stormstrike cooldowns (since the third Stormstrike's cooldown doesn't matter as the final stack is applied immediately).<br>
<br>
I haven't had a chance to personally check out most of the bosses that we've had a chance to fight so far on the PTR.  Does anyone have an idea of how each totem fairs on the bosses such as Festergut, Rotface, Lady Deathwhisper, Gunship and Sindragosa?  Well, it's mostly seeing if the Enhancement totem's mechanics won't facilitate near 100% uptime.<br>
<br>
From watching a Sindragosa video, I'd see the stack for the Enh totem falling off during the air phase since there's a bit of waiting in which Flame Shock would probably still tick on Sindragosa providing better uptime.  Deathwhisper and Gunship battles look to work with both from the limited parts of the fight that I could see.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>It doesn't actually Rouncer. Latency adds a delay to when the ability is next used (as an adjustment to GCD) but it doesn't affect ability X is available delay using it for Y seconds and use a different ability instead which is what I think is being asked for.<br>
<br>
ie: A "oh bugger I didn't notice MW5 is available and I used X instead" thus delaying MW5_LB for a GCD. If we had a parameter that was default zero that added X seconds after MW5 became available before you used it. Or a percentage chance you'd not notice MW5 and use something else. This would allow such effects to be mimicked in sim so you could see the effect of missing a MW5 for instance.<br>
<br>
Agreed that if people are looking for "I don't always press the button right on time and there's a bit of a delay" then they should be upping the Latency to something like 300-500 from the default 100-200.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

(e) wait, I just took a real look at your math and what are you actually showing there?  If the glyph ends up working like the Army of the Dead talents and reducing the cooldown by 4 minutes then on a 7 minute fight the glyph would mean you could summon the elemental twice.  Which would be (575 * 180)/420 or 246dps.  What you are showing is just the dps increase of using a single summon of the elemental in an encounter instead of using Magma Totem.<br>

</div>What was shown here is that on a fight where you could drop a fire ele twice as a result of using Glyph of Fire Ele, the glyph would be worth 146dps. The following was stated and assumed as being the facts of the fight.... A, the glyph reduced the cooldown by 5min, B the fight length was exactly 7min, C the duration of fire ele is 2min, and D my magma would produce 725dps and the fire ele would produce 1300dps.<br>
<br>
so.....<br>
<br>
(1300-725) * 120 / 420 = 164dps<br>
<br>
Granted i'm no math genius but pretty sure thats right... if it was a 6min fight and the glyph still reduced it by 50% thus making your second fire ele only have 50% uptime it would than be.... 575 * 60 / 360 = 96dps...<br>
<br>
<br>
and of course... if the fight duration was too short that it would not allow for a second cast of your fire ele in the same fight its dps value is 0....<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1450869"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I've just added the T10 bonuses to Rawr.Enhance now that we know the name of the set (Frost Witch's Battlegear). Initial calculations suggest that the 2 piece bonus has a 24.9% uptime and so will add around 3.07% bonus damage multiplier and the MW5 will have around 25.2% uptime which on 8456 AP (from BiS thread) gives extra 425.6 AP. <br>
<br>
These calcs were done by loading the BiS file into the latest Rawr build and stepping through the new formulae for the T10 bonuses.<br>
<br>
I then simply edited the T9 sets and changed the bonus name so that it the only dps difference would be to lose the T9 bonuses and grant the T10 bonuses. WITH NO OTHER CHANGE IN STATS, the T10 set bonuses were a 168.7 dps or 1.86% dps improvement over T9 set bonuses.<br>
<br>
It occurred to me that people would also wish to know the change from T9 4 to T9 2 + T10 2 would be. So I set this up, again with ZERO other changes in stats. The T9 2 + T10 2 bonuses came out 88.81 dps or 0.98% dps upgrade over T9 4 piece. So it would appear that breaking the T9 4 piece bonus IS a dps upgrade for Enhancement without any consideration for T10 having higher stats on them in any case.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1451208"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->It's going to be ridiculous for mana if we're not worried about dropping magma every 15-20 seconds.  I was a little worried about where Fire Nova would end up fitting in to that whole scenario, but 950 mana every 2 mins compared to ~6684-8912(20-15 second intervals) alleviates any worries of that.  It is, however, really contingent on the glyph remaining unchanged.<br>
<br>
At the guy above me: I don't think it's intentional.  The 2 minute thing is shared by the elementals to prevent you from dropping both at the same time and it probably forces a blanket cooldown on all of the spells that includes the elemental that you just dropped.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>However, the second that the boss needs to be moved fire nova will become useless since it is centered around the totem. This makes the glyph likely very good for stationary fights but much worse for any type of movement fight (which depending on strategy, is the norm in TotC). In addition, the fire elemental would need a 4 minute uptime to be worth it during the fight (as shown by Rouncer earlier in the thread). So we will need to see which fights (if any) this glyph would be useful for in ICC. Likely there could be a few, but I would place my money on several fights where this is not the case.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1451399"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Wow, if that glyph goes live at an 8 minute cooldown reduction, that would be amazing. Granted, there will be very mobile fights that would still call for Magma Totem, but what I think I might do is create a spec for Fire Ele that replaces Glyph of Windfury, and a spec for Fire Ele for immobile fights like Jaraxxus and Twins.<br>
<br>
I think some calculations might need to be done for those that don't want to dual-spec PvE Enhancement. Replacing a glyph (which will be WF/LS/FS, as Feral Spirit and SS have been proven to be the two definite glyphs) will set a requirement on the amount of time the Fire Ele will have to be hitting the boss in order to break even with the glyph you replace.<br>
<br>
Using the data from the previous page (1300 DPS Fire Ele, 725 DPS Magma Totem) 100% uptime and effective attacking time of fire ele would be:<br>
<br>
1300 - 725 = 575 dps increase.<br>
<br>
Now in order to do this, you'd need to replace a glyph. Let's assume Windfury, and that it's roughly 80 DPS:<br>
<br>
575 - 80 = 495 DPS.<br>
<br>
That's a really strong glyph. Almost so strong that I don't see it getting to live, but if it did it might possibly bring us up to par with the meter topping DPS classes. Now, at a more in depth look, let's assume the fight is mobile and the ele might not be hitting the target for a certain period. In order to allow the glyph to be worthwhile, it would have to be in combat for:<br>
<br>
80 / 575 = 13.9%, or 16.7 seconds.<br>
<br>
Wow. 16.7 second uptime out of 120 seconds? That's incredible and easily attainable. And then if the boss has moved away from the fire ele and probably won't move back for more than 16.7 second uptime (which I find hard to believe), you can just put down Magma Totem and proceed as usual until the cooldown is up.<br>
<br>
Also keep in mind, this is assuming the fire ele is only hitting one target the entire time. How often does he fire nova? and what does the DPS from his fire nova seem to be? We would need this data to figure out if Fire Ele would be best in an AoE situation, and if not, at what amount of mobs would it be better to place MT instead of GFE.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now keep in mind these are <b>ONE PERSON'S NUMBERS, AND YOU WILL HAVE TO DO YOUR OWN CALCULATIONS WITH YOUR OWN NUMBERS TO FIGURE OUT YOUR OWN STATISTICS, JUST LIKE EP VALUES.</b> Also, I don't know quite what the exact value of the WF glyph is but this value seemed to pop into my head, and if it's wrong just plug the value in and fix the equation.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>You can't just take difference between the fire ele and magma totem and call it day due to the fact that we will always now get 1 fire ele, the glyph doesn't modify that.

<br>
However you are close to 1 thing as my previous numbers had shown, If the glyph itself allows you to recast your elemental once in the fight and he's only on target with the totem inrange of the boss for 50% of the time (meaning you cast magma totem at 1min left cause he's off fucking around) its still a dps increase over WF or LS glyphs.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Well yeah I know this is a VAST oversimplification of the glyph, but I think (and someone correct me if I'm wrong) if the fight is 4 minutes long, meaning 2 complete fire elementals, you CAN just take the difference and call it a day, or be close enough to calling it a day.<br>
<br>
EDIT: I just had a thought. If Blizzard really does give us this, I think they might nerf the Fire Ele slightly so while it might still be an increase in DPS, it's not so dramatic. Here's to hoping we get this wonderful buff.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>EDIT: Oh wait, I see what you mean. For any time after the initial 2 minutes, it's a DPS increase, because the glyph doesn't affect having the fire ele up for the first 2 minutes of every 10. So for a 6 minute fight, it would be (1300 - 725 - 80) * (240 / 360) = 330 DPS. I gotcha =) but as you get closer to 10 minutes, that value gets closer to the perfect value of 495. (EDIT: Perfect is actually 396)<br>
<br>
Or actually, it wouldn't be 495. For a 10 minute fight, it would be 495 * 4 / 5, or 396 DPS increase. You're right, my math was a bit flawed.<br>
<br>
EDIT2: Just a forethought, in order or this glyph to equal a WF glyph @ 80 dps assuming these numbers, the fire ele would have to be active for exactly 13.9% of the time past 2 minutes the fight lasts, plus a little extra to make up for it being "useless" the first two minutes. So about 10, maybe a bit more, seconds per minute. Easily attainable still.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Ok instead of doing the pure math I'm going to use Heroic Anubarak's numbers from my WoL's to give a Real Fight Example though you must keep in mind that every fight is different. Anubarak and his adds make 5 targets for my Magma totem / Fire ele to hit though its not 100% as the adds die before the new wave comes in. However the boss is stationary and I almost always hit all 5 targets while the boss is up (we use 1 tank for adds).<br>
<br>
Here are some recent parses of a heroic anub kill with the only data seleted being 1 section of when he is being dps'd with 2 waves before he submerges. This shows the Magma Totems dps in that part of the fight only, I'm sure its alot less when your killing all those little bugs, but since my fire ele was used in p3 we want to compare apples to apples here.<br>
<br>

<br>
Here's the overall fight which shows a "Greater Fire Elemental" listed under my name with an uptime of 118.3 seconds (I cast him exactly at 30% so the fight must have ended 1.7 seconds before he would have despawned)<br>
<br>

<br>
So to answer the question, for ME on one parse of MY Heroic Anub'arak, the difference in AoE is 2431 - (1698 + 1667) / 2 = 748.5dps<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1452357"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Thank you, and very interesting.<br>
<br>
It seems that the Ele is actually better at AoE than Magma. The difference for the previous people appear to be around 5-600 DPS on single target, but on several adds it jumps to about 1k.<br>
While we are all different (me being lesser geared since my Shaman is only my main alt), I doubt that gear and difference of scaling can change totemvalues to such an extent as to make it a reverse of your results. <br>
I was sure Magma was better on AoE.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
On the MMO Champion Shaman forum that I moderate users have done some testing and noted that our Spirit Wolves benefit from hunter pet food <a id="itemlink" class="q1" style=" font-weight: bold;" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100124025039/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=43005" target="_blank">[Spiced Mammoth Treats]</a>. I've not had time online yet to try this myself but according to one tester you can summon the wolves then use a treat as two separate actions but without triggering a GCD when you use the treat. <br>
<br>
They seem to get the +30 str &amp; stamina which would be +60AP. I raised the point that perhaps only one wolf gets the treat and so only +30 AP average. Its not a huge dps boost but its a dps boost assuming they are right about the GCD and its possible to macro that (even if its a double keypress). It does strike me as a very expensive dps boost given it costs a northern spice every 3 mins.<br>

</div>Cross posting this from mmo-champ as it pertains to this discussion:<br>
<br>
A few notes on this as I have way too many northern spices.<br>
<br>
Using the pet food does not trigger the GCD.<br>
<br>
It (on glance) seems to only affect one wolf. At least the buff only shows up on one wolf. It only uses one. I didn't test trying to use two treats.<br>
<br>
Of course this will be different in a raiding scenario, but to give an idea, wolves did (for me) ~507 DPS on the dummy without the treats or any other buffs/cds, ~534 DPS with them. Both were averaged over 4 trials each. There was VERY little variance. I entered combat by wind shearing followed by having auto-attack on but was too far away to hit the heroic dummy. So 0 buffs, 0 dps from me.<br>
<br>
Take what you will from this silly test. Perhaps something to look into.<br>
<br>
one more note though: 30 dps seems very very high. I can only assume that both wolves are getting the buff. Levva, perhaps we do need some best lore action to look at it.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1452503"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Yup extra testing with a hunter and viewing pet tab to see primary wolves stats would be useful. If you have ShockAndAwe installed it auto activates the pet tab, so you can see wolves stats &amp; also view the more interesting info in the tooltips.<br>
<br>
I'm heading to bed now though as it's 2:30am here I'll try to get my hunter mate to test things tomorrow unless someone else manages to get some interesting stuff whilst I sleep.<br>
<br>
Agreed that the quoted 30dps improvement seems way way too high. A recount issue? I think we need a /combatlog to verify figures.<br>
<br>

		<!-- message -->
		<div id="post_message_1452780"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->So I went back to the heroic dummy and did 5 tests with and without food and recorded a combatlog.<br>
<br>
You can find the data here: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100124025039/http://www.worldoflogs.com/reports/3qg8u7oyogs3v6x5/" target="_blank">World of Logs - Real Time Raid Analysis</a><br>
<br>
Again it was impossible to see if both wolves were getting the food buff. But the results are interesting. Ignore time 982s-983s I screwed up. Here is a short summary:<br>
<br>
No Food:<br>
<br>
432s-475s: 524 dps<br>
<br>
619s-662s: 536 dps<br>
<br>
801s-845s: 521 dps<br>
<br>
1005s-1049s: 512 dps<br>
<br>
1189s-1231s: 524 dps<br>
<br>
Average no food: 523.4 dps<br>
<br>
With Food:<br>
<br>
1372s-1414s: 533 dps<br>
<br>
1552s-1595s: 553 dps<br>
<br>
1736s-1778s: 535 dps<br>
<br>
1921s-1963s: 536 dps<br>
<br>
2103s-2145s: 571 dps<br>
<br>
Average with food: 545.6 dps <br>
<br>
<br>
So, at a quick glance, a 22 dps difference. Again, no buffs, no combat from me other than wind shear (in this case, for the treat tests, wind shear was macro'd to the spiced mammoth treats) to start the wolves to the dummy once they were summoned. <br>
<br>
Going a bit further, 571 dps on the last try seemed very high compared to the others. If you do not include that data point then you get 539.3 dps, which is still a 16 dps difference. Though I am inclined to include it for such a small sample size. <br>
<br>
So again, disclaimer, this is ONLY a test dummy with NO BUFFS OR DEBUFFS on the target or myself. My AP was constant at 4761 for the entire time.<br>

Searing totem would free up some global cooldowns to be used on Fire Nova instead of Magma Totem refreshes, and iirc the dps difference between Searing and Magma is rather minimal,<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
Maybe it will look better when it's not on a human model.<br>
<br>
So now that Black Magic gives 250 haste proc on spellcast, has anyone done any testing as to what would be the best enchant combo? Will it be 2x BM, Berserking/BM, or 2x Berserking?

				<div style="font-style:italic">So now that Black Magic gives 250 haste proc on spellcast, has anyone done any testing as to what would be the best enchant combo?

<br>
That pretty much rules out 2 BM, and beyond that there haven't been any sim updates to include 3.3 abilities as of yet.  With a 10 sec duration/35 sec ICD you average 71.43 haste from the enchant, and berserking(according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100124025039/http://elitistjerks.com/f47/t20765-shaman_enhancement/" target="_blank">Shaman: Enhancement</a> ) is worth around 160 ep.  Unless you have haste ep exceeding 2.24 berserking looks superior on paper.  The simulator may suggest otherwise, so until that's updated it's all speculation.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I read up on various posts and the consensus figure seemed to be 45 seconds. It would make a lot of sense to re-check this on the latest PTR as naturally a shorter GCD will make for a better uptime and thus a better enchant.<br>
<br>
[Edit] I modified the Rawr source to suggest a 35 sec CD and berserking still came out ahead on my gear. Retrying with the BiS gear set from the BiS thread still gives Berserking ahead by a wide margin on either MH or OH. It looks like at current gear levels Black Magic is not at all viable.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
From the work I did on Rawr.Enhance adding them it looks like they give a small dps boost on existing T9 totems, and are once again fairly close together so choice will probably depend if you go for haste or AP.<br>
<br>
[Edit] I've also added in support in Rawr for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100402060613/http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/50035/black-bruise/" target="_blank">Black Bruise - Items - Sigrie</a> and its AWFUL. A 1% proc rate on melee swing?? Now I've modelled this as 1% on melee hit which might downgrade it slightly as I doubt it procs if you miss but who knows, we'll need to test it when someone gets their hands on it. <br>
<br>
It seriously lacks other stats and comes out marginally BELOW the Hellscream Slicer/Stormpike Cleaver 245 version ie: NON heroic weapon version. <br>
<br>
Now there are a number of caveats here, does the 9% damage simply mean a raw 9% boost to all our damage? This is what I modelled it as. Does the "as shadow damage" part make any significant difference eg: treated as a spell so ignores armour? This would mean my model was wrong. Does it proc on melee hit or simply on weapon swing? Does it refer to the weapon swing of THIS weapon or either weapon? If its this weapon only then the number of swings that can proc it is a LOT lower and it falls even further down the list.<br>
<br>
[edit2] I just noted that it does 9% bonus MELEE damage I'd modelled it as bonus damage (ie: including spells) this makes it even worse!! It's now coming out slightly worse than Caress of Insanity and The Masticator!!<br>

		<div id="post_message_1457465"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Not sure how you exactly tested it, but just to give an idea of how I understand, you have a 1% chance to gain the buff Necrotic Touch for 10 seconds.<br>
During these 10 seconds any melee attacks deal 9% of the damage they did as shadow damage additionally.<br>
Well melee attacks in our case should be anything that does physical damage (plus Lava Lash? it's not physcal but counts as a melee attack and follows melee rules).<br>
Looks like this to me:<br>
I gain the buff.<br>
MH hits for 1000<br>
Necrotic Touch hits for 1000*0.09 shadow damage<br>
Windfury hits for 2000<br>
Necrotic Touch hits for 2000*0.09 shadow damage<br>
Windfury hits for 2000<br>
Necrotic Touch hits for 2000*0.09 shadow damage<br>
<br>
That's about how it sounds to me.<br>
I wonder, though, if Lava Lash counts in, while it says melee attacks, it might in reality just count in physical damage.<br>
<br>
Well what got me off-guard is that the effect seems to eat up a lot of the item budget and unlike the onyxia weapons these don't really count as gimmick weapons.<br>
I sure hope that there are weapons without the effect, just the usual stat allocation.<br>
<br>

		<div id="post_message_1457563"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->That's what I thought, so the real end result should be a little bit higher, since the shadow damage won't be reduced by a boss' armor.<br>
Still doesn't sound like enough to compensate for the lack of more stats.<br>
So far it seems to be the only effect weapon that came up, the other weapons are all 5/10man ones, there at least seems to be more variety in weapons than in TotC, so there should be at least one more weapon in ICC 25man normal, may be even 2-3 more, let's see if there are some upgrades among them.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>1% proc rate isn't 1PPM. We don't know yet if its on melee hit ie: OH hits can proc it, or on MH hit ie: only the hits from the weapon itself. Also is it hits or is it swings, could a miss proc it?<br>
<br>
Assuming the worst that it is MH swings only ie: the weapon procs from its own swings, then the swing rate will be around 1.2-1.4 hasted. Which is 428-500 swings per 10 min combat 1% proc is 4 or 5 hits per 10 min combat. Lets say 5 procs in 10 mins that 50 sec or 8.33% uptime. 9% physical damage at 8.33% uptime is a 0.075% PHYSICAL damage boost. <br>
<br>
On the current BiS set roughly 54.85% of the damage is physical so this is a 0.00411% damage boost proc. ie: say 9445 dps BiS this is 38.85 dps from the proc = pathetic.<br>
<br>
If its based on OH swings too then its around double this figure. Which is still very low as remember the weapon is missing a shed load of other stats.<br>
<br>
Now of course if it is based on all weapon swings its more. If its only based on weapon hits its less. etc. If the damage is independent of boss armour ie: its 9% of UNMODIFIED dps rather than 9% of landed dps then its more.<br>
<br>
Until someone gets their hands on it we won't know for sure, but we should hope its only a placeholder - despite the fact <b>the proc was discovered 3 weeks ago</b> (see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100402060613/http://www.mmo-champion.com/news-2/patch-3-3-ptr-notes-update-1023/" target="_blank">Patch 3.3 PTR Notes Update - 10/23</a> ) and we only today discovered what the proc applied to. Personally I therefore don't think its a placeholder. I think that's the proc. <br>
<br>
The 1% chance might be wrong however. It NEEDS to be wrong at this stage or its looking like a very poor weapon choice that seems designed to be our BiS weapon. NB. the heroic version is 10% physical damage boost.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>As soon as you switched to Avalanche wouldn't the Dot tick on FS no longer refresh the Shattered Ice Buff? I'd imagine you'd only have less than 30 seconds to switch relics and refresh it, and with Fire Nova possibly eating up alot of our free GCD's this may prove to be a bit difficult. Also if you ever miss the 30 second window you'd have to let it rebuild back up, meaning Avalanche would fall off again while waiting for the 5 ticks.<br>

</div>It will turn into 2 gcds/30 second period once you have both buffs rolling and with every relic swap you're also resetting your swing timer.  It's certainly doable to swap them between attacks(reminds me of old arms warriors, would need to swap right as the swing animation starts instead of when damage is dealt), but I have to wonder at what point in latency it would become a hindrance to DPS.  Would the extra buff outweigh losing 2 swings per hand per 30 second period?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>From my understanding, it has a chance to increase strength, agility, haste etc. My expectation is that it will be like the greatness/death's verdict trinkets.<br>
<br>
For example, one of the buffs is: <br>
<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100210071127/http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/71485/agility-of-the-wolvar/" target="_blank">Agility of the Wolvar - Spells - Sigrie</a><br>

<br>
<br>
So, until someone gets this and we can see some testing on it, we will not be able to know if all of them have a chance to come up (there's 6 or 7 different ones) or if it is class or stat specific.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Assuming the worst that it is MH swings only ie: the weapon procs from its own swings, then the swing rate will be around 1.2-1.4 hasted. Which is 428-500 swings per 10 min combat 1% proc is 4 or 5 hits per 10 min combat. Lets say 5 procs in 10 mins that 50 sec or 8.33% uptime. 9% physical damage at 8.33% uptime is a 0.075% PHYSICAL damage boost. <br>
<br>
On the current BiS set roughly 54.85% of the damage is physical so this is a 0.00411% damage boost proc. ie: say 9445 dps BiS this is 38.85 dps from the proc = pathetic.</div>

</div>Mixed up some %-values? However the 38.85 dps are correct, but the wrong %-values are confusing ^^<br>
<br>
<br>
I have a general question regarding the new FireNova and his influence to weapon enchants...<br>
I think u alrdy modelled it in your Sim? @Levva<br>
<br>
If FireNova gets in our prio and with the new totem, even AP-Enhancer won't use LL that often anymore, right?<br>
Is there still a difference between WF/WF and WF/FT?<br>

<br>
Those are the effects of the trinket (though I think I have at least one missing).<br>
<br>
We have 7 classes who get use of the trinket Shaman, Warrior, Paladin, Rogue, Hunter, Druids and Death Knights, in case I forgot one it would fit the amount of effects, though I don't think it will work like that but rather that you gain a random effect.<br>
If it is dependent on class and we get 1200 ap (not sure if they wanted the haste on for us), then it's probably easy BiS for us, if not it would need some good testing, though it's probably quite good even if it's a random effect.<br>
<br>
It's unlikely, though, that it works like Grandeur and Death's Choice/Verdict, considering that the classes who get the most out of strength and agility will still always have more AP and the other effects wouldn't proc for anyone (besides haste for us, though we would still have more than AP then our haste two times).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I suspect you are right our big problem with EnhSim will be that it doesn't have any means of knowing about multi targets and thus will still happily tell us that haste is great. Adding a Boss Handler is beyond the scope of where EnhSim is, it would need a ground up re-write to cope.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Just checked on the sim and even if you remove LL from the rotation WF/FT is still significantly more dps then WF/WF.  Even if you remove the major spell enhancing raid debuffs (CoE and ToW) WF/FT is still significantly better then WF/WF so WF/FT isn't going to change with the introduction of Fire Nova.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

From the work I did on Rawr.Enhance adding them it looks like they give a small dps boost on existing T9 totems, and are once again fairly close together so choice will probably depend if you go for haste or AP.<br>
<br>
[Edit] I've also added in support in Rawr for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100210071127/http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/50035/black-bruise/" target="_blank">Black Bruise - Items - Sigrie</a> and its AWFUL. A 1% proc rate on melee swing?? Now I've modelled this as 1% on melee hit which might downgrade it slightly as I doubt it procs if you miss but who knows, we'll need to test it when someone gets their hands on it. <br>
<br>
It seriously lacks other stats and comes out marginally BELOW the Hellscream Slicer/Stormpike Cleaver 245 version ie: NON heroic weapon version. <br>
<br>
Now there are a number of caveats here, does the 9% damage simply mean a raw 9% boost to all our damage? This is what I modelled it as. Does the "as shadow damage" part make any significant difference eg: treated as a spell so ignores armour? This would mean my model was wrong. Does it proc on melee hit or simply on weapon swing? Does it refer to the weapon swing of THIS weapon or either weapon? If its this weapon only then the number of swings that can proc it is a LOT lower and it falls even further down the list.<br>
<br>
[edit2] I just noted that it does 9% bonus MELEE damage I'd modelled it as bonus damage (ie: including spells) this makes it even worse!! It's now coming out slightly worse than Caress of Insanity and The Masticator!!<br>
<br>
This is bad bad news folks.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">We're going to want both totems unless Blizzard changes how they work.  Equip Shattered Ice and let it stack up.  Equip Avalanche, eating 1 GCD, and continue dpsing as normal.  Swap in Shattered Ice whenever you need to refresh your DoT and then swap back to Avalanche after the DoT ticks once.  Shouldn't be hard to manage for a significant stat boost and I would expect Resto to start doing the same thing unless they change the buffs so that they are tied to the relics.</div>

</div>This is completely untrue. There are 7 sockets on the 25-man tier set alone (not including offset). Socketing all of them with expertise gives exactly the 140 expertise rating non-orcs require.<br>
<br>
I don't think it's optimal, and it's certainly boring, but it definitely seems like 7 of our sockets will be getting used on expertise gems.<br>
<br>
Fakeedit: after rereading your post perhaps this is what you meant? It seemed not since you mentioned you were a blacksmith and profession has no bearing on the number of sockets you get on the tier set.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>You're being a bit melodramatic.  Even if all of the tiered/offset Icecrown gear lacks expertise you're at most committing 7 sockets to expertise gems, and the 5 t10 pieces alone cover that.  It's likely that you will only use 4 of the pieces, but even then finding two sockets in 10 other pieces of gear shouldn't be too difficult.  <br>
<br>
With that in mind you must remember that there have only been partial loot tables from a fraction of the bosses that will occupy Icecrown, and there are still plenty of slots unaccounted for.<br>

</div>I for one suspect Blizzard is trolling Levva.<br>
<br>
On the Expertise note, it's good that they put it on a ring. You can't have it be an emblem item sadly, because then Hunters are stuck without an emblem ring (Sunmote anyone?). I'd rather have a ring slot to play with expertise cap with than have it be a deciding factor in juggling gear around for tier bonuses etc. Of course these stats are likely not finalized in any case.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1464024"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I have an additional problem with our set once again being itemized (as all LK gear seems to be to date) for hunters-who-happen-to-melee: stamina. Yes, I know, stamina is the least sexy stat there is, but I'm tired of being 10k health behind some of our retadins (and 2k behind some of our mages). Rets are just an example; plate and leather melee as a whole tend to have more health - one assumes to compensate for PBAoE - itemized on their gear.<br>
<br>
The early (placeholder?) stats once again put us almost 200 stam behind retadins, and that's just set pieces. It's not just plate; the rogue set, made for folks that have a few more get-out-of-jail-free cards than we do, has 100 stam more. Sure, we could gem for stamina, but our DPS is balanced around the maximum possible DPS-related stats being enchanted/gemmed into our gear.

				<div style="font-style:italic">This is completely untrue. There are 7 sockets on the 25-man tier set alone (not including offset). Socketing all of them with expertise gives exactly the 140 expertise rating non-orcs require.<br>
<br>
I don't think it's optimal, and it's certainly boring, but it definitely seems like 7 of our sockets will be getting used on expertise gems.<br>
<br>
Fakeedit: after rereading your post perhaps this is what you meant? It seemed not since you mentioned you were a blacksmith and profession has no bearing on the number of sockets you get on the tier set.</div>

	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>It does matter, since you have to at least use 1 of the 7 sockets for something other than expertise (Nightmare Tear), in order to achieve your meta socket.<br>
<br>
<br>
EDIT TO ADD:<br>
<br>
what you all seem to forget about the lack of expertise, is that such a thing takes away from freedom when testing stats... if most of your sockets have to be committed for expertise, you then can't test how would your dps be if you stacked AP, or Haste, or Hit, or heck ArP (if they were to add scaling to pets that they stated bluntly that they won't)<br>
<br>
So yeah, there is an issue about the lack of expertise.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Something else to keep in mind is that because the gear doesn't have expertise, it will have all those other stats.  Granted, I doubt there will be 4 pieces for each slot so we can play "pick 3 of 4" stats and test that way (by dropping one of haste, ArPen, AP, or crit on each of 4 pieces).  Still, I'd hope that in 12 bosses we would have at least some choice.<br>
<br>
That doesn't completely negate the lack of some expertise on tier gear, but it doesn't do much good to gloom and doom before we've at least seen the rest of the gear.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

If there was too much on the tier pieces you get just as locked out of loot as too little except then it would be even worse.  What if they put 67 expertise on the gloves?  Then as an orc I can't use that ring because it puts me way over the cap and the additional expertise would be wasted.  With how they are now I can use my T9 gloves as an offset piece until I get that ring or another upgrade that has an equivalent amount of expertise and then upgrade my gloves to T10 without any real issues.<br>
<br>
I'm actually more worried about the lack of hit on the tier pieces since we need a lot more of that to reach the spell hit cap, especially if we want to be capped without the 3% raid buff for 10 mans, but there is no need to fret about a loss of freedom until we see more of what will be available.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Given that, between the Ashen Verdict, updated Dalaran Ring, and at least two rings so far in the instance itself, there will be lots of options to fill those slots it strikes me as rather limiting to point to the ring as an excuse to limit the flexibility of the other 3 races that need 140 points of Exp just so Orcs don't go over cap. Especially when Orcs could, just as easily, replace at least one piece of Exp toting tier gear with an off set piece to use the ring as well.<br>
<br>
Additionally, the argument also runs on the assumption that the BiS weapon(s) for us in the instance won't be Maces, either because Black Bruise truly proves to be as bad as expected, they don't itemize an axe at the 262 lvl, or they do another 1 iLvL boost off of Arthas drops similar to Kel in Naxx.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Last I checked the MMOC drop lists (which should be noted that they aren't complete), none of the leather physical DPS gear had Expertise on it either, so it seems that ring is one of our few options apart from lots of  gemming.  I mean, to my knowledge, the whole reason Blizzard put Expertise on our gear is because Hunters don't need it, so the chance for a non-set mail piece to have Expertise is slim to none.<br>

</div>Using EP values to attempt to quantify what we need the proc to be worth it would have to be worth ~175.33 dps to be equal to the 278.3EP stat value difference between the fist and that sword. <br>
<br>
The proc says "your weapon hits" so lets work off the assumption that all weapon hits (not just mainhand hits) can proc it at the 1% rate.  Over a 5 minute 4 second Jaraxxus-25H kill, I had 466 melee hits that should qualify under the conditions listed for the proc.  That would be a hit every 0.65 seconds or approximately 1 proc every 65 seconds.  Giving it an uptime of 10/65 or 15.4%.  The melee component of my dps on that encounter worked out to 3565.8 dps so the 9% additional shadow damage would be 321 dps while active and with a 15.4% uptime that would be 49.4 dps.<br>
<br>
If the proc's damage is affected by CoE and can crit separately then it would be worth 434.6 dps or 66.9 dps with the 15.4% uptime.  Which pretty much matches Levva's conclusions from a page or so ago.

I hope a lot of people will be lucky enough to pick one up!  Unfortunately, it's not really much of an upgrade (if any) to the easily attainable 258 cloaks in ToGC.  Either way, the heroic version will be excellent for people who don't like to gem for expertise.  That one, we WILL have to wait a little while for. QQ<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>My response was poorly worded.  What I was trying to say is that with such limited options of Exp\Hit there will be a handful of almost necessary pieces, or we would have to completely regem for Exp\Hit before considering other upgrades viable, which is kind of contradictory to Blizzard's statements towards Ele Shaman on New Gear.  Luckily for Enhancement there will be no Tier9 set nerfs ;p<br>
<br>
As for what Levva said, I forgot that ICC was having loot like ToC and that there was also the same cloak from 10-man non-heroic.  Yes that cloak will probably be had by a lot of people the first day ICC is out (pending glitches), but It's still a shame that our gear is itemized identically to Hunter's, when you would think them doing significantly better damage would be enough &gt;.&gt;<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

From your post in the EnhSim thread, I used the second option. 62% boss+2 adds, 38% single target. I simply simmed with 100% uptime for each fight, then used the % time you showed.<br>
<br>
It may be better to break it down even further, i.e. assuming all 4 fights (I am excluding faction champions) last an equal amount of time (I know they don't): 36% single target, 45% boss+1 add, 19% boss+4 adds.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1477764"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Ah, no that should be fine. I just wasn't clear that is what you were doing.<br>
<br>
The numbers I worked up (the 62% uptime for 2 adds) takes into account fight length for the 4 relevant fights in the zone. It's part of the reason that the number is so high, because the Anub'arak fight is so long (also because it has 4 adds).<br>
<br>
Yeah, that makes much more sense now.<br>
<br>
<br>
On that topic, I noticed that you used a fight length of 7 minutes with a RNG of 35%. The average fight length that I came up with for the zone was just over 5 minutes. Not sure how big a difference that will make.<br>
<br>
When considering the RNG value, I know there has been a lot of discussion about it. I was kind of thought that if you just picked a middle (or median) fight length, and then adjusted the RNG so that the high end hits the longest fight and the low end hits the shortest fight (or something close; doesn't have to be exact).<br>
That way, as the sim run fights of different lengths, it simulates fighting the various bosses in the zone in question each with their own duration.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I didn't want to push the RNG level too high and was also basing it on previous RNG discussion, so I settled on 35% and 7 mins, which let me go as low as 5 mins.

</div>One other thing to consider has to do with fire ele totem and high movement fights.  From what I understand, the fire nova effect comes from the fire elemental totem itself, which means that if you drop a fire ele on a high movement fight, you may not be able to fully take advantage of fire nova even if the fire elemental will continue chasing the target.  Does this mean that replacing a magma totem and using fire nova is more viable or does the freeing of the gcd and increased damage of a fire elemental make up for this loss?  <br>
<br>
Of course, this probably has no simple answer since you may get some use of fire nova with a fire elemental before a boss moves out of range.<br>
<br>
If nothing else, I think we'll have to be a bit more aware of when we drop a fire elemental totem and not just with regards to the cooldown.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1483226"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->The 2 points in Imp Fire Nova don't really change much about Fire Nova's place in the priority list.  It's real low in the priority list, just above refreshing Lightning Shield and below Lava Lash, for single target.  Two targets it's just below Chain Lightning with 0/2 in Imp Fire Nova and just about even with Chain Lightning with 2/2 Imp FN.  With three targets Fire Nova is above Chain Lightning when talented and about even when not.  More then three targets and Fire Nova is better no matter how you are talented.<br>
<br>
The talent is worth taking if you will be encountering any AoE at all so should be part of any raiding shaman's build meaning you hit Fire Nova if there is nothing else to hit when there is only one target and you hit it as often as you can if there is more then one target getting hit.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I'm going to be going with a similar spec -1 point in imp stormstrike and putting it back in reverb.  In a raid I don't believe mana regen will be enough of a problem to warrant any points in imp stormstrike with the buffs/replen/sr on every cooldown. We'll just be hurting for mana anywhere but in raids.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I read up on various posts and the consensus figure seemed to be 45 seconds. It would make a lot of sense to re-check this on the latest PTR as naturally a shorter GCD will make for a better uptime and thus a better enchant.<br>
<br>
[Edit] I modified the Rawr source to suggest a 35 sec CD and berserking still came out ahead on my gear. Retrying with the BiS gear set from the BiS thread still gives Berserking ahead by a wide margin on either MH or OH. It looks like at current gear levels Black Magic is not at all viable.</div>

</div>Rawr continues to put Berserking ahead on either MH or OH by a decent margin, but EnhSim disagrees.  BM comes out ahead of Berserking with a slim margin when enchanting the OH weapon.<br>
<br>
I find this only true for the new 19/52/0 spec and FN low in the rotation.  My older 20/51/0 spec put dual Berserking ahead.<br>
<br>
This could simply be related to my gear, does anyone else see a similar effect?  (I'm running haste&gt;AP gems.)<br>

</div>Why glyph Fire Nova? That is going to very heavily weight things towards haste I would imagine. Given that a 3 sec FN is going to screw the priorities royally. A 3 sec CD with a 1.5 sec (hasted less of course) GCD means that almost every second keypress FN would be available. This seems a BAD idea unless you are in very heavy AoE territory. On normal single targets you need the extra 3 sec to get in extra abilities. <br>
<br>
Hint its a waste of a glyph if you are not actually making use of the extra 3 seconds CD. With all our other abilities I really don't see how you can make use of it unless you are almost spamming FN because of AoE trash. ie: Glyphing for an AoE build = ok, glyphing for a standard build I think is a mistake.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Rawr continues to put Berserking ahead on either MH or OH by a decent margin, but EnhSim disagrees.  BM comes out ahead of Berserking with a slim margin when enchanting the OH weapon.<br>
<br>
I find this only true for the new 19/52/0 spec and FN low in the rotation.  My older 20/51/0 spec put dual Berserking ahead.<br>
<br>
This could simply be related to my gear, does anyone else see a similar effect?  (I'm running haste&gt;AP gems.)<br>

</div>Can you give me some actual numbers please. ie: When you have berserking on OH and compare Rawr with Enhsim where if anywhere is the major variations. If you change to BM on OH and compare Rawr with Enhsim where are the variations. ie: look at each DPS component and tell me what component is giving the variation.<br>
<br>
It could be that for instance Fire Elemental is being used in one and not the other or that the dps of Fire Nova is being calculated differently etc. What we need to test is with all the huge changes in EnhSim and Rawr where the actual differences are. ie: its not enough knowing the total differ. I need to know that for instance WF dps changed by 10 in Rawr but 100 in EnhSim when switching from Berserking to BM.<br>
<br>
Oh and on the config. LL last?? Really? And cast_magma_only_if_ticks_left   is recommended to be set to 2 to help uptime of magma totem.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

So for now we have to wait for someone to get it and confirm if it really only procs certain buffs for us and if so, which our buffs are.<br>
In case it really works like that my guess would be we get AP, haste and crit.<br>

Hunters  AP, Agi, Crit,<br>

		<div id="post_message_1484989"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->In my 25 man ICC last night, I used only one point in Imp SS and my mana was fine. Seeing as all discussions are tailored towards 25 man raiding, I think we can confidently say it's not necessary for two points in mana regen talents. However, I was having issues with using so many GCDs  before my priorities reset again. It's almost like LL is pushed out of our rotation altogether. With this in mind, I also don't think we should have any points in Reverberation at all and instead put them back into Imp Shields.<br>
<br>
But anyhow, back to the LL issue, at this point with Fire Nova being put ahead of it in our priorities I think its safe to say the Totem of Quaking Earth is out of the picture entirely and ALL shamans should be using Totem of Electrifying Wind (until they get enough badges for the new SS totem). I will be more than happy to post numbers on these once I get the latest version of enhsim.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1485145"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->LL isn't pushed out of the rotation.  FN is the lowest priority when there is only one target, it's really only worth pressing if you have 2/2 Imp FN in your build.  Add more targets and FN goes up in priority but LL is still a good button to press.<br>
<br>
Which completely conflicts with your totem selection since ToEW only procs when you use LB and if there is more then one target you want to use CL anyway and when there is only one target that is when you want to prioritize FN meaning LL barely gets pressed, etc.  However ToQE has a 9 second cooldown anyway so reducing the frequency of hitting LL really isn't a bad thing in regards to that totem's uptime.  With that in mind, I still recommend using ToQE over using ToEW.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

If you change to BM on OH and compare Rawr with Enhsim where are the variations. ie: look at each DPS component and tell me what component is giving the variation.  The DPS improvement of putting BM on the OH is very slight, as Sprinter noted in his summary.  (Typically under 5-10 DPS.)  I've tried switching to AP gems, I've tried T10 gear with set bonuses, I've tried different trinkets, ect.  In each case I see dual Berserking either equivalent or slightly lower than Berserking/BM from EnhSim.  Rawr never shows BM catching up to Berserking in either hand.  <br>
<br>
It could be that for instance Fire Elemental is being used in one and not the other or that the dps of Fire Nova is being calculated differently etc. What we need to test is with all the huge changes in EnhSim and Rawr where the actual differences are. ie: its not enough knowing the total differ.

I'll include the numbers run with 10k hours simulation time below.  The default EnhSim and Rawr priorities are different.  Rawr has fewer options than EnhSim, but as EnhSim shares priorities with SAA, my play style will more closely resemble it than Rawr.  I did not equalize their priorities by unchecking those missing in Rawr, but I did make sure that those that exist in both were sequentially similar.<br>
<br>
As to the config, <b>EDIT</b> I see what ya mean Leeva, LS&gt;LL&gt;FN is superior to FN&gt;LS&gt;LL.  Previously I was only juxtaposing LS and LL's priorities ignoring FN.<br>
<br>
The cast_magma option set to 0 reliably results in overall higher DPS than 2.  It is true that the uptime is a little better set to 2 ticks, but overall DPS takes a significant 65 DPS hit.  My Berserking/BM comparisons above were done with a 0 MT tick setting, I'll add a run with 2 MT output being the only change.  It appears that 2 ticks upsets the rotation enough that DPS is noticeably lower in LL and ES.  <br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">LL isn't pushed out of the rotation.  FN is the lowest priority when there is only one target, it's really only worth pressing if you have 2/2 Imp FN in your build.  Add more targets and FN goes up in priority but LL is still a good button to press.<br>
<br>
Which completely conflicts with your totem selection since ToEW only procs when you use LB and if there is more then one target you want to use CL anyway and when there is only one target that is when you want to prioritize FN meaning LL barely gets pressed, etc.  However ToQE has a 9 second cooldown anyway so reducing the frequency of hitting LL really isn't a bad thing in regards to that totem's uptime.  With that in mind, I still recommend using ToQE over using ToEW.</div>

</div>Here are the numbers I promised, the 1st is putting FN over LL with Totem of Electrifying Wind and the second is LL&gt;FN with Totem of Quaking Earth.<br>

</div>How do you figure?  If what you're saying is true then: 30/120 = 25% uptime on Deathbringer's Will.   From a guildy last night: 15/45 = 33% uptime on Whispering Fanged Skull.<br>
<br>
Let's assume we're talking the ilvl 264 DBW and the ilvl 251 WFS.  Let's also assume you proc the AP every single time on DBW.<br>
<br>
DBW: 1200 AP * .25 ~= 300 static AP.  155 Arp ~= 155 * 1.5 ~= 232.5 AP.<br>
WFS: 1100 AP *.33 ~= 366 static AP.  131 Crit ~= 131 * 1.9 ~= 248.9 AP.<br>
<br>
I don't think its very clear at all that DBW is worth it for us.  Especially when you consider the heroic WFS and the Herkmul War Totem.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Here are the numbers I promised, the 1st is putting FN over LL with Totem of Electrifying Wind and the second is LL&gt;FN with Totem of Quaking Earth.<br>

Not "obviously" and it proves nothing except that people need to sim out their priorities based on their gear since LL over FN is "obviously" better in all my sim runs.<br>
<br>
Besides in your other post you were talking about dropping LL completely which is ALWAYS a dps loss.  Take notice of the Lava Lash ppms in both of your runs.  One has you hitting LL on average every 8.29 seconds and the other every 7.98 seconds.  Either of those maintains ToQE at a very nice uptime.<br>
<br>
As for using ToEW instead of ToQE, that probably is a dps upgrade if the fight has no AoE at all.  Moment there is AoE and you hit Chain Lightning instead of LB you were better off using ToQE, unless the AoE is so predictable and has enough of a pause that you can swap relics without the resetting of your swing timer or the GCD affecting your dps. <br>
<br>
<br>
Edit - Besides wouldn't you want to test both sets of priorities with the same totem so that the totem couldn't be what is actually skewing your results anyway?  More then likely all that your results prove is that ToEW is a slightly better option the ToQE provided you never cast Chain Lightning.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1485564"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I never actually mentioned taking LL out of the rotation entirely. I simply said that I was using them noticeably less often. After looking more closely at the results it appears I was mistaken about the magnitude of this issue. <br>
<br>
I also tested both rotations with ToQE and FN&gt;LL still came out better. However, after testing it farther, it appears each rotation wins out depending on the test. So it appears to me that with each totem the same there's no clear winner between priorities. I will appropriately edit my previous post to reflect this discovery. However, the combination of FN&gt;LL with ToEW still for me always comes out ahead of LL&gt;FN with ToQE. You are quite right about how this only applies in a situational context. Universal truths are quite rare when it comes to Enhancement, so instead I would only like to point out the circumstantial difference between the two setups. <br>
<br>
If in a single target situation, FN should only be used before LL if you have ToEW equipped. When tested without changing priorities the Totem only gives me around 4 dps, and changing the priorites WITH the totem gives me 17.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">But anyhow, back to the LL issue, at this point with Fire Nova being put ahead of it in our priorities I think its safe to say the <b>Totem of Quaking Earth is out of the picture entirely and ALL shamans should be using Totem of Electrifying Wind</b></div>

</div>That statement is so wrong there is no argument or rationalization you can make that will adequately defend it.  ToEW drops down to ~50% uptime in the sim when I added in 25% AoE time which really isn't very much when you think about it.  Meaning ToEW is only better if you never have a reason to use Chain Lightning during an encounter.<br>
<br>
What uptime percentage difference did you note when you dropped ToQE down a notch in the priority list?  Guessing it really wasn't a significant difference though and that is because you are still using LL practically just as often in the sim even with the lower placement.<br>
<br>
Let me try to break it down a little more for you.  If there is any portion of an upcoming fight where using Chain Lightning instead of Lightning Bolt would be a dps increase then you should be using ToQE.  So when fighting Patchwerk or a Heroic Targeting Dummy break out ToEW but for just about every other fight you should be using ToQE.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Hint its a waste of a glyph if you are not actually making use of the extra 3 seconds CD. With all our other abilities I really don't see how you can make use of it unless you are almost spamming FN because of AoE trash. ie: Glyphing for an AoE build = ok, glyphing for a standard build I think is a mistake.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>Minor point, but if you know ahead of time that a given fight will be heavy on AE, carrying a stack of glyphs of each type and swapping them out as needed can gain you the advantage needed for either condition.<br>
<br>
The question then becomes, How many mobs, for how much percentage of the fight make it worthwhile to swap out in favor of the FN glyph vs keeping a glyph focused for a "standard build".  Depending on the nature of the fights in ICC (My raiding charter avoids spoilers as a rule so I don't know the details yet of each fight) this question may be worth asking.<br>
<br>
Of course I don't know if someone would be determined enough to keep up with the cost of supplies and the cost to the pace of the raid in order to keep swapping glyphs or even specs(if we conclude differing specs excel under different conditions) as fights demand.  But then you hear about people swapping entire trade skills within a week when it's advantageous enough to do so, so who knows.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

From looking at my meters, Lightning Bolt consistently puts out higher avg normal and critical damage than when Chain Lightning is hitting less than 3 targets. Due to range and other factors, I can't think of too many fights beyond Anub that benefit using Chain Lightning consistently.<br>
<br>
With that said, I prefer Quaking Earth and find my DPS is generally always better when I use it.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1486033"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Twins, Jaraxxus, Beasts and Anub all have pretty heavy use of Chain Lightning in one phase or another and it doesn't need to be that heavy for it to affect ToEWs uptime considering it's cooldown and our frequency of MW stacks.<br>
<br>
As for your meters you are reading them wrong.  Each hit of Chain Lightning is counted as a separate cast in the meters.  So your average damage is also including all the hops.<br>
<br>
Looking at a Beasts we did recently my highest crit for LB (not including Ice Howl) was 11108 and my highest first hop for Chain Lightning was 10145.  Highest second hop was 5255.  15400 &gt; 11108.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

1.With what build you should go now i managed to agree maybe one of these are pretty decent<br>

<br>
2.I see you are tempted to use Fire Nova instead of Lava Lash , do you think is wroth spamin` it o non-trash (adds) fights?<br>
I mean 1000 mana , you`ll deffinetly need improved SS<br>
<br>
3.Are we still going for haste gems stack?<br>
<br>
4.And last can you confirm that using Magma Totem instead of Lava Lash can incr your dps?<br>

</div>That would suggest a partial priority that has LL_QE, FN, LL as part of the ordering, ie: if no QE buff then use LL over FN otherwise use FN over LL. That is nice and easy to test and as you say is similar to the other partial priority which is ES_SS, SS, ES!!<br>
<br>
So perhaps our initial thoughts pre-patch of having LL_QE way up high in the rotation wasn't a good idea and perhaps having it fairly low and affecting FN is best. eg: something like...<br>
<br>
SR, SW, SS_0, MW5_LB, FE, MT, FS, <b>ES_SS, SS, ES, LL_QE, FN, LL</b>, LS<br>
<br>
That includes the two partial priorities as above.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>It's hard to say. Some shamans decide to stack haste, some go for pure AP and some go for a mixture between the two. Either way though, as it stands there doesn't seem to be much of a difference between either of those three options. If you're not sure a safe bet would be to gem for AP generally and then use the AP+Haste gems for yellow sockets.<br>
<br>
However you're posting on a website which centers around minmaxing and getting the most out of your character, so you should probably use Rawr.Enhance / EnhSim and see for yourself. I'd put money on either of those telling you to gem for haste though.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1486275"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I am concerned about the glyphs. Of course having the Fire nova glyph is a must if you don't want to sacrifice your second spec or keep switching glyphs all the time, and Stormstrike glyph is way high. But the third glyph is where i'm riddled. The Fire elemental glyph is way too hard to calculate its benefits. It depends on many many things, including if the boss is moving or not, how much time passes between tries/bosses, how long the fight lasts.<br>
<br>
 I am thinking of using it just to keep my dps consistent in each try no matter all those factors i mentioned, but is this the true way or i should forget about Fire elemental completely and just drop it when its on cd?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I was just checking on the comments to <a id="itemlink" class="q4" style=" font-weight: bold;" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091217101350/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=50362" target="_blank">[Deathbringer's Will]</a> , it seems that every class has a limited list of buffs they can get.<br>
So for now we have to wait for someone to get it and confirm if it really only procs certain buffs for us and if so, which our buffs are.<br>
In case it really works like that my guess would be we get AP, haste and crit.<br>
<br>
Warriors seem to get ArP, Str and Crit,<br>
Hunters  AP, Agi, Crit,<br>
Druids ArP, Str, Agi.<br>
<br>
The internal cd doesn't seem to be 45s, though (most likely due to the 30s duration), seems to be on 90s internal cd.<br>
So we need someone to confirm the cd, too.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">LWhich completely conflicts with your totem selection since ToEW only procs when you use LB and if there is more then one target you want to use CL anyway and when there is only one target that is when you want to prioritize FN meaning LL barely gets pressed, etc.  However ToQE has a 9 second cooldown anyway so reducing the frequency of hitting LL really isn't a bad thing in regards to that totem's uptime.  With that in mind, I still recommend using ToQE over using ToEW.</div>

</div>Not sure I agree with this.  Although I would rather have the AP than the haste when hitting more than one target, I still find myself hitting LB much more than LL in such a situation.  MW will often stack to 5 before CL comes off CD, but finding the GCDs to hit LL can be few and far between.<br>
<br>
Regardless, by the time heroic ICC unlocks this will be a long gone issue anyway.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>He's partially wrong.  He's forgetting about the GCD lowering effect haste has on spells.  Haste actually does more than just increase auto-attacks, it can potentially get us using more abilities per minute.  It also increases MW proc rates.  For me, I'm currently seeing haste stacking winning out for both single target DPS AND multi-target DPS.  It seems this is because I'm casting more CLs, which is in turn overriding the damage lost on individual CL casts.  Additionally, our rotation is very "full" right now so haste helps even that out as well as possibly getting us casting more abilities per minute.  All of these things can increase our AoE DPS despite lowering the individual power each ability casted.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Okay i actually managed to read most of the thread cuz i really don`t know for what to go , so i will be really thankfull if you answer me some questions : <br>
<br>

<br>
2.I see you are tempted to use Fire Nova instead of Lava Lash , do you think is wroth spamin` it o non-trash (adds) fights?<br>
I mean 1000 mana , you`ll deffinetly need improved SS<br>
<br>
3.Are we still going for haste gems stack?<br>
<br>
4.And last can you confirm that using Magma Totem instead of Lava Lash can incr your dps?<br>
<br>
<br>
Thanks and best regrads , sorry if i` m borring you with those questions <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20091217101350im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":)" class="inlineimg"></div>

I was talking about that with another shaman earlier.  For what to buy first depends entirely on your current trinkets.  If you are rocking a Comet's Trail AND a 258 Death's Choice then buy the Relic first.  If your luck with trinkets is more like mine then save up the extra week (or two) and buy the Trinket first.<br>
<br>
As for which relic to buy, I'm going with the Enhancement one but my reasons have more to do with quality of life then dps.  Which one is more dps is something that is going to be debated for awhile in these forums since there really is no clear consensus yet on the Haste vs AP debate.  Haste is definitely really good, it's more of a question of is it really that much better then AP in the actual game.  I've just taken to following the advice of a friend and gemming everything with Stark gems till we get a real consensus on which is better.<br>
<br>
Why the enh totem then?  Because I do like to BG and I do run dailies too and I basically never cast Flame Shock outside of a raid but there aren't any circumstances in game where I won't be hitting Stormstrike.  When there is nothing else to buy and emblems are just stacking up then I might pick up the Elemental Totem if it does end up being a dps increase over the enhancement one but I have a lot of things left to buy before I get to that point.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>That's a great point I didn't think of actually. In Arenas the new Enh totem should be even better because of the SS CD reduction. I've been passing on nabbing a 258 Death's because it's better for the other melee classes and have some crappy trinkets. I probably will end up snagging the emblem trinket first and then possibly picking up the Enh totem when season 8 comes out assuming the PvP enh totem is far inferior like it was in season 7.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1487408"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I'd echo Rouncer's rationale wrt the totem.  The elemental one might end up to be proven as better DPS (and a mage in our guild looked at it and declared it OP and destined for a nerf...so it may very well be <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100217011836im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/biggrin.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":D" class="inlineimg">), but the quality of life of having something that stacks on stormstrike vs something that isn't even currently in my rotation (no FS glyph/adding it to my rotation here) even on boss fights, much less out doing dailies or trash or an number of other things...makes the decision easy.  Doubly so since I am far more interested in getting the trinket than I am either relic (rockin the 128 hit trinkets...either/or depending on what I'm doing).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Here's a good point that I've been struggling with.<br>
<br>
I happen to have <a id="itemlink" class="q4" style=" font-weight: bold;" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100217011836/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=45609" target="_blank">[Comet's Trail]</a>, and I just recently picked up <a id="itemlink" class="q4" style=" font-weight: bold;" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100217011836/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=50343" target="_blank">[Whispering Fanged Skull]</a> from our 10man ICC.<br>
<br>
I replaced <a id="itemlink" class="q4" style=" font-weight: bold;" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100217011836/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=45522" target="_blank">[Blood of the Old God]</a>, as I was way over hit cap anyway, and the slightly less attack power for 50% longer duration was a no brainer for me.<br>
<br>
I'm more interested in the comparison of <a id="itemlink" class="q4" style=" font-weight: bold;" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100217011836/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=45609" target="_blank">[Comet's Trail]</a> vs <a id="itemlink" class="q4" style=" font-weight: bold;" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100217011836/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=50355" target="_blank">[Herkuml War Token]</a>.<br>
<br>
<b>Comet's Trail</b><br>
Passive: 240AP<br>
Proc: 726 haste for 10s (45s ICD) - averages 161 haste<br>
<br>
<b>Herkuml War Token</b><br>
Passive: 153 haste<br>
Stacking: 340AP<br>
<br>
On a sustained fight, it looks like you get 100AP in exchange for ~10 haste, which seems worth it. I'm more curious about proc mechanics, and synchronization with other trinkets. <a id="itemlink" class="q4" style=" font-weight: bold;" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100217011836/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=45609" target="_blank">[Comet's Trail]</a> and <a id="itemlink" class="q4" style=" font-weight: bold;" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100217011836/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=50343" target="_blank">[Whispering Fanged Skull]</a> appear to have the similar proc mechanic (most damage dealt is a melee swing for us), so if they are consistently proc'ing together, I would expect that combination to yield higher DPS.<br>
<br>
I guess mostly I'm looking for thoughts, since this is a much fuzzier decision than a lot of our gear choices, and I have trouble trusting the sim on this type of decision.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>My mistake, I linked the wrong item in that sentence. I was definitely talking about the <a id="itemlink" class="q4" style=" font-weight: bold;" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100217011836/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=50343" target="_blank">[Whispering Fanged Skull]</a>.<br>
<br>
I mean, a lot of fights you stop DPS for some period of time, before starting again, and it lets the ICD on both trinkets reset, and when you start DPS again, they almost always proc together. Even on sustained fights they will often proc together just because they're coming off CD together.<br>
I know that you can't count on this, but it does happen consistently, and I'm just wondering if the combination of both trinkets proc'ing together will out DPS the extra 100AP from the War Token. (also, both trinkets proc'ing just as you start DPS is nice when killing adds since there's no ramp up time; thinking Lady Deathwhisper in particular).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1489030"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Flametongue provides an additional 211 spell damage.  I believe the fire nova coefficient is 21.41%.  This means that fire nova will be doing ~ an extra 45 damage.  Under an ideal fire nova every 3 seconds this is 15 dps per mob.  The magma totem has a coefficient of 10%, which means 21 damage every tick, or 10.5 dps per mob (ignoring the aoe cap, not sure what it is).  The coefficient for the 2nd and 3rd jump total 68%, which would mean 143.5 damage every 6 seconds or an extra 24dps.<br>
<br>
If you want to see how much of a dps loss not using WF is you could probably sim it.  Create something like a 1 minute fight with a rotation similar to what you would do in an AOE fight.  Sim it with WF and then with double flametongue.  <br>
<br>
The formual would then be: (WF DPS - (FT DPS + 24)) / (25.5) which would get you the number of additional mobs you would need to fight to make it worth it.<br>
<br>
This obviously just an estimate as it ignores any proc/mechanics that favor single/multiple mobs.<br>
<br>
edit: If you wanted to be even more accurate you could ignore my ideal dps figures and calculate what the dps would be from your sim log.  For example, we know fire nova does an extra 45 damage with the extra flametongue weapon, but if you only managed to cast it 18 times instead of 20 in your 1 minute sim then the added dps is (45*18)/60 or 13.5.  Same with chain lightning, but you can pretty much assume you will have magma totem up constantly.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Don't get me wrong, ArP is suboptimal but if I'm offered a 264 with haste and a 277 with ArP, generally the ilvl jump is enough to make up for the suboptimal stat.  Keep in mind that although ArP is bad, relative to other classes "worst stat" we come out pretty well.

If it's 100% then I would think EF is a far superior talent to the second imp SS as you'd have a very high clearcasting uptime in multi-mob situations which is when we need more mana efficiency (as FN gets bumped up in our priority so much.)<br>

Another thing to note, it appears to me, that they improved Chain Lightning's jump code, which is very nice. Not so nice, that there was still no other mainhand option discovered for us in ICC25. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100217011836im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/frown.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":(" class="inlineimg"></div>

</div>He doesn't need to. There's already a slow sword in Bloodvenom Blade to complete the required Sword/Axe spec requirements for Combat.<br>

You're likely gonna have to hope for a Mace although, really, the answer here likely depends on how they intend to treat Arthas loot. If they go back to Naxx style 1 tier higher 'cause it's the last boss in the instance/expansion (and the iLvl on Shadowmourne may indicate this to a certain degree), then we can expect something for everyone to a point. If not, and they stick with the current hard mode/normal mode eating up the iLvL shift that Kel used to occupy, then really they can drop whatever they feel like there to fill holes and it becomes much more of a crapshoot as to what can be expected.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Can you post an issue on EnhSim as to what exactly EF should be doing now so that a rigorous test can be made to ensure its current with how it is in game. I'm thinking that perhaps Tukez put in something if there was a known bug.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1490111"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I posted a ticket about it already.  How it was working on the PTR was Fire Nova would proc Clearcasting but then would not consume a charge and didn't receive the mana reduction.  That is the model that is incorporated into EnhSim at the moment.  At release they fixed that "bug" and now it procs clearcasting and can consume the charges as well as receives the mana reduction.  It uses one charge per cast no matter how many things get hit and it procs off any crit no matter how many things Fire Nova hits.<br>
<br>
The bug just refers to the behavior on the PTR.  Prior to that there was no interaction between the talent and the spell as it was a totem so couldn't proc from a Fire Nova crit and couldn't consume the charges either.<br>
<br>
Basically EF is a ~400 mana cost reduction on Fire Nova when active and it is active a lot when there is more then one thing being hit by Fire Nova.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
We all know about EP and EnhSim is a great tool to calculate them. But may be it will be possible to automatically calculate the optimized Priority list by using these EP points?<br>
Is it possible to make some kind of EP values for each spell(ability) in priority list which will based on main EP values?<br>
<br>
For example if I got 2.37 Haste EP value in current gear- my SS_0 must be 1 and MW5_LB must be 1.5. (Just example)<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">It's seems I got a noob question here. Sorry for that.<br>
<br>
We all know about EP and EnhSim is a great tool to calculate them. But may be it will be possible to automatically calculate the optimized Priority list by using these EP points?<br>
Is it possible to make some kind of EP values for each spell(ability) in priority list which will based on main EP values?<br>
<br>
For example if I got 2.37 Haste EP value in current gear- my SS_0 must be 1 and MW5_LB must be 1.5. (Just example)</div>

</div>Shamans started casting Flame Shock when it's duration got increased to 18 seconds.  This was essentially a 50% boost to the damage per cast of Flame Shock, bringing it up above ES as long as you're not clipping the dot more than 1 tick.<br>
<br>
LL_QE gives you a better uptime on the totem buff, but LL is enough weaker than other abilities, that you end up losing damage overall, even though you have slightly longer periods of time with the extra AP.  SS_0 is the same idea, it buffs damage, but at the cost of using a weaker ability first.  If you have a MW5 stack and hit SS to put up the debuff, you will possibly waste a few procs of MW, if you'd cast MW5_LB without the debuff, then hit SS, you'd get those procs toward your next stack, increasing your DPS, so they sorta cancel each other out.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Guy above addressed Flame Shock so I'll skip that part.<br>
<br>
LL_QE and SS_0 are attempts to quantify the benefit of having their respective buffs/debuffs active.  Using them can increase your uptime of those buffs and it was very nice of the EnhSim coders to add them into the Sim.  However just because they are there doesn't mean they are dps increases just as using ES_SS isn't necessarily a dps increase.<br>
<br>
I've run many sims and found that SS_0 has no positive effect on my dps.  Either it does nothing or it causes a reduction.  That is not to say it won't someday be a dps boost, just that that day has not arrived.  At least that is according to my testing, your results may vary so please feel free to test it for yourself and avail us of the results from your testing.<br>
<br>
LL_QE ended up being a dps loss, plain and simple.  That it would be a dps loss wasn't something that could be known until the sim allowed us to model it.  Again your results may vary so please feel free to test it and if your results are different please post about them so the community can benefit from your labors.<br>
<br>
As for your "assumptions", maybe you shouldn't try so hard.  The simulator is what we use as napkin math doesn't do our "rotation" any justice and there is too much RNG involved in a single fight to allow for any meaningful results for comparison.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>This is why I have questioned the need to have so many conditional priorities in our 'rotation'.  As you yourself stated, the SS_O and LL_QE seem to add little to no benefit to the overall damage, and I highly doubt there will ever be a situation in which worrying about those instances in which you 'need' to cast those spells will actually result in a higher dps over simply using whatever ability is off cooldown at the time.<br>
<br>
This is why I again advocate using a 'fixed' rotation, fixed in the sense that you do cast a MW_LB/CL, LS, MT et al whenever the situation warrants it, and let a simple macro worry about the rest.  It was proven before that even the WORST rotation comes within ~1% of the maximum theoretical damage the simulator can do, and since no one here can walk on water in real life, you will never have the 'perfect' priority system in game.  In many cases, simply having a 'good enough' system ends up being better in the long run.<br>
<br>
And while it is highly amusing to see people with a 'new' priority system that increases our maximum theoretical dps by a whopping value of 1 - or less - in practice there are so many random factors that come into play in an actual raiding environment that such a strive for excellence does more harm than good.  Whatever happened to KISS?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
I'm still an opponent of the "fixed" rotation because it makes for bad players.  There are ranged attacks mixed in with melee attacks and if you just use a macro to handle them all then your macro could easily be locked up when forced out of melee range meaning you would then have to remember where you had another binding for the shock outside of that macro costing you dps.  What if you need to use Frost Shock?  If you are just spamming your macro how will you keep it reserved when you need to snare?  Are you going to rewrite your macro just for that fight and then retrain muscle memory specifically for it?<br>
<br>
I use macros a lot and if they would work just as well then I would advocate them.  I castsequence macro SS and LL together (used to use a castrandom macro for them with an override for SS) since limiting LL to an 8 second cooldown was worth not having to think about it.  Does it cost me dps?  Probably but when I run the sim it shows a PPM for LL in an "ideal" rotation of 6.49 or once every 9.24 seconds.  Maybe once per raid I find myself wanting to hit LL but my macro is on Stormstrike but that seems a small price to pay for convenience.  However there is a big difference between that and sticking shocks into a macro with SS and LL and Fire Nova and spinning a mousewheel.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1494110"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->That is why you add reset functions into your macros.  You could have a Wind Shear macroed with say, Frost Shock or Flame Shock, or pushing alt lets you reset your damage macro on a new target etc.  That seems like it would be far less complicated than having to chose between one of TEN different abilities at any given moment, and actually lets you concentrate on some of the boss mechanics like knowing when to start moving just before Anub burrows, or seeing a Bone Spike 10 yards away and moving to kill it in Marrowgar, for instance.<br>
<br>
Its a shame the simulator doesn't let you choose a completely fixed rotation.  Fortunately, you are in the position to actually do a test in real game conditions and decide for yourself, or dare I ask if we have come to rely on the Simulator so much so that such testing is a waste of our time?<br>
<br>
The shaman forums are filled with bad players with bad expectations, and rightfully so.  The theory crafting discussion on these forums is far above the expectations that Blizzard has for its players as seen with the nit picking total rearrangement of the priority system for ultimately meaningless single digit or less dps gains.  And then when players come here asking questions, or post on the wow Shaman forums and get a generic 'SIM IT' response they are overwhelmed with so many possibilities that it is ultimatly hard to nail down what exactly is important and what isn't these days, such as your LL_QE case.<br>
<br>
So I propose this:  we actually test a macro system and compare it to the priority system with a few key control cases IN GAME and actually see which one stacks up best or which one is simply 'good enough'.<br>
<br>
Then, on TTT page, you can post a 'beginner macro' along with a 'new to enhancement shamans? USE THIS MACRO' explanation, and leave the 'priority system' up for those advanced players who wish to be bothered with such a complex decision making process.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
By the way, I use tons of alt/shift/ctrl macros.  My Stormstrike/LL castsequence macro casts Wind Shear if I hold Alt and Chain Lightning if I hold shift for example.  My Earth Shock becomes Flame Shock when I hold alt or shift (haven't found a good use for shift and that mouse button yet).  Frost Shock becomes Hex with shift and when shift and ctrl are held it hexes my focus target.  <br>
<br>
There is a big difference between all that and a massive castsequence macro that just hits your abilities in some semblance of an ideal priority rotation which is what you seem to be proposing.  What 10 abilities are you talking about anyway?  There are 4 abilities you could castsequence together; SS, LL, FS and ES.  Unless you going to stick Fire Nova in the sequence and watch it break when you don't have a fire totem active?  Also Fire Nova is your highest priority when there are multiple targets but your lowest priority when there is only one target, so are you going to make two sequences?  What if they glyph Fire Nova for a specific AoE heavy fight (like Anub), would that mean three separate castsequences?<br>
<br>
Notice what I said about melee range and ranged attacks in the other post.  Are you going to have people make a sequence with shocks and then bind another button for their shocks to use when they are out of range and their castsequence macro gets stuck on a melee attack or will you have them use a reset button to get back to Flame Shock and then refresh their Flame Shock unnecessarily because the macro is too dumb to know that it should hit Earth Shock instead?   One way they have a dumb macro costing them damage, the other way they have to bind the shocks anyway but then they aren't good at hitting those buttons since the macro made them lazy.  Unless you leave Flame Shock out of the macro but then that could be a nice chunk of lost damage.  Although that would solve the issue of the macro Flame Shocking things that are going to die too quick for the DoT to tick out at least. <br>
<br>
I like macros when they work well, just not when they only work well enough.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1495116"><!-- google_ad_section_start --><b>Black Magic and Berserking uptime</b><br>
<br>
It appears as though black magic may be increasing the ppm of berserking, possibly through an increase in white hits or windfury (thanks to Rouncer for noticing that).<br>
<br>
Raid uptimes on berserking appear to increase from 40% to between 46% and 66% uptime on berserking with black magic on the offhand. The average increase I see is +13% (or 32.5% increased effect) across the data I have available to me.<br>
<br>
I did some dummy testing and here is some results:<br>
<br>
1. With BM on a 2.6 speed OH (with FT), and Berserk on MH (with WF): <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100210152136/http://www.worldoflogs.com/reports/9s6qgcdlhtyhzy0u/details/1/?s=1549&amp;e=1872" target="_blank">World of Logs - Real Time Raid Analysis</a><br>
2. With no enchant on 2.0 speed 4.0 dps OH (with FT), and same MH: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100210152136/http://www.worldoflogs.com/reports/9s6qgcdlhtyhzy0u/details/1/?s=1900&amp;e=2201" target="_blank">World of Logs - Real Time Raid Analysis</a><br>
<br>
In case #1 berserking had a 39% uptime, while in case #2 it was only 29%. Additionally in case #1 WF procced 33 times, versus 19 without black magic.<br>
<br>
Has anyone noticed a similar pattern?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

It has been noted that when OH is enchanted with Black Magic then the uptime of berserking in the main hand jumps in a very dramatic manner. We need users to test this in game and provide solid testing data of the effects.<br>

</div>That would do it.  Should always sim with at least 200ms of lag <i>(I use 200-250 typically)</i> since that is also attempting to account for human reaction time as well as server latency.  Also should use the combat variance function as well, 35% is the currently accepted value.<br>
<br>
Making those changes dropped your config down to 8942.71 dps.<br>
<br>
Swapping Windfury glyph for Lightning Shield gains you another 30 dps.<br>
Swapping a point in reverb for a point in Elemental Focus gets you another 20 dps. <br>
Dropping LS refresh to 1 charge remaining and then moving it's priority to above MW5-LB gained 87 dps<br>
<br>
Dropping that last point in reverb and putting a point in Imp SS will gain you about 1.5 dps for a single target encounter.  <br>
Dropping that last point in reverb and adding 1 point in Imp SS will gain you 20 dps when there are 2 additional targets 35% of the time and Fire Nova is moved to just under MW5 in the priority list (swapping to chain lightning during the multi-target phases).<br>
<br>
Dropping SS_0 from the priority list costs 3.33 dps so looks like it is worth keeping there after all.<br>
<br>
Overall Gain - 140.89 dps<br>

Drop Windfury Totem for the testing.  More static haste would be good to help normalize the results and pull Windfury Imbue off the mainhand altogether.  Then it would be a white hit comparison which is better for comparison purposes.  Definitely get offhands with equivalent speed and you should wear 68 additional haste rating when testing with the offhand without any enchant (27% uptime on Black Magic equals 68 haste rating).  Also remove anything that can proc any form of haste, including Flurry if possible.  Also use the level 60 or 70 dummy to remove misses and glancing blows from the table.<br>
<br>
5 minutes isn't enough for relevancy.  Really want at least 1000 mainhand hits to establish relevancy.<br>
<br>
Edit - if you use 68 additional haste on the set with the unenchanted offhand then you don't need to drop Windfury totem as the overall haste should be equal between the two samples.  Then you can just AFK while you beat on the dummy in each condition.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Test #1: 0 haste rating on gear. Hit was 263 and expertise was 11/11.

<br>
Uptime on berserking was 39.5%<br>
<br>
Test #2: Added a cloak with +70 haste (but no more +hit or expertise). MH/OH were the same.<br>
<br>

<br>
Uptime on berserking was 38.9%<br>
<br>
Test #3: Was the same as test #1 except that the OH was now enchanted with Black Magic.<br>
<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100225234123/http://www.worldoflogs.com/reports/b2osyyxfxayyc86u/details/2/?s=2726&amp;e=3881" target="_blank">World of Logs - Real Time Raid Analysis</a><br>
<br>
Uptime on berserking was 37.2%<br>
<br>
<br>
From these tests, it seems as though the enchant, or the averaged haste from the enchant does not have an effect on the uptime of berserking. <br>
<br>
However, something is causing there to be a higher uptime in raid of berserking compared to what has been shown in EnhSim, and that increased amount seems to be variable. This may or may not have to do with black magic (it is looking like it doesn't), but it has only shown itself since we have put it on the offhand. Putting berserking on both main hand and offhand gives a static ~60% uptime on berserking (this does not take into account double procs), and browsing combat logs for deathbringer saurfang this does not seem to vary much at all.<br>
<br>
From this post: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100225234123/http://www.mmo-champion.com/class-shaman/enhance-black-magic-vs-berserking/msg1884532/#msg1884532" target="_blank">Enhance: Black magic Vs Berserking?</a> we now have some more data coming in with black magic in the OH that is causing some sort of increased uptime/variability in uptime for berserking. This person had 47% uptime on berserking on saurfang, which is the low end of what I have been experiencing.<br>

		<div id="post_message_1496717"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I don't know much about how EnhSim works, but I'm not at all surprised that there is a symbiotic relationship with a Berzerking/Black Magic setup.<br>
<br>
I see a couple of major flaws in the testing done above.<br>
<br>
1) Test time too short to ignore the highly variable nature of the buffs in question, especially when buffs like Flurry get mixxed in.<br>
2) Does not at all take into account instant abilities, which count toward PPM rates.  I believe that this would apply to both Windfury and Stormstrike for MH weapon procs.  In other words, Black Magic reduces your GCD and increases your swing speed, thereby increasing the number of SS and WF hits you are capable of over that 15 seconds.  So, the logical conclusion is that Black Magic (or any Haste proc) increases the PPM of Berzerking on your MH, but to see it we must have both WF and SS in play.  Also, all Haste buffs that would be available in a raid environment should be taken into consideration IMO.<br>
<br>
Edit:<br>
To further expand on what I found through my research, has anyone read the following post:<br>
<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100225234123/http://elitistjerks.com/blogs/rezarel/288-3_1_ptr_ppm_test_results.html" target="_blank">http://elitistjerks.com/blogs/rezare...t_results.html</a><br>
<br>
Conclusion Quoted:<br>
"Proc chance per swing does not change with haste rating or Flurry. PPM procs use base weapon speed to calculate proc chance per swing."<br>
<br>
If I'm interpreting the above quote correctly, that means that Haste also increases Berserking uptime through the increase in white hits per minute.<br>
<br>
Thinking about this even further, I think that (for Enhance Shaman) Berserking proc'd via MH versus Berserking proc'd via OH could potentially have a significant difference in uptime based on two things (unfortunately I couldn't find any testing to confirm my hypthesis):<br>
<br>
1) Windfury procs Berserking.  FT does not (it's spell damage.. incidentally it does proc Black Magic).<br>
2) Besides SS, LL is the only Yellow ability that I am aware of to proc a weapon enchant on your OH.  LL is very low in the priority list right now, and gets even lower when we swap out of TotQE.  WF hits should significantly outnumber LL for a well geared Enhance Shaman who is doing the rotation correctly.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>This is exactly it. I was excluding most other variables (of course I could not exclude flurry, so I admit it is a confound), just to show that it is not encoded in black magic itself to increase the uptime of berserking. Much more likely it is a factor of windfury uptime that is interacting with haste, which would follow our models of "haste sweet spots". This is much more tricky to model outside of a simulator, and something I am currently working on.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Speculation:  Is it possible in a raid environment that we are reaching levels of haste which shorten our GCDs down to a point where more abilities can be fired per minute(or whatever time period) that the additional attacks gained (both whites and GCDs fired) give us enough additional oppurtunities to apply Berserker that we see an increase in it's uptime?<br>
<br>
Solo, perhaps we don't have the synergies required to accomplish this same level of haste?  Or more to the point since you were minimizing the use of additional abilities in your test, perhaps you were robbing yourself of the very thing which leads to more Berserker procs?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Speculation:  Is it possible in a raid environment that we are reaching levels of haste which shorten our GCDs down to a point where more abilities can be fired per minute(or whatever time period) that the additional attacks gained (both whites and GCDs fired) give us enough additional oppurtunities to apply Berserker that we see an increase in it's uptime?<br>
<br>
Solo, perhaps we don't have the synergies required to accomplish this same level of haste?  Or more to the point since you were minimizing the use of additional abilities in your test, perhaps you were robbing yourself of the very thing which leads to more Berserker procs?</div>

</div>Which is just a really long way of saying the haste from black magic is what is causing the increased incidence of berserking and since the haste is modeled properly in EnhSim there is nothing else that needs to be taken into account.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1496977"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Ahhh, I think I misunderstood the direction of the discussion.<br>
<br>
Still, after doing some testing with EnhSim, I have to question if it's calculating Berserking uptime correctly in relation to Haste.  To test, I took my character with my current gear to Enhsim and removed the OH enchant.  I ran the following sims:<br>
<br>
No OH enchant (otherwise base gear) Uptime (melee Haste is 11.50%) = 41.14%<br>
No OH enchant + 68 Haste Uptime = 41.08%<br>
<br>
Thinking about it, I thought maybe the difference was too small to notice.  So next I went to the extreme:<br>
<br>
Zero (yes, zero) Haste Uptime = 40.81%<br>
50% Haste Uptime = 42.89%<br>
<br>
So, for an increase of 50% melee haste, the increased uptime for Berserking is just over 2%?  That just seems off to me.  These same sims showed an increase in MH damage of about 45%, which to me means that I would hit 45% more often with that amount of Haste, since all other stats were unchanged.  Still, the difference does seem to show up, so I have to wonder if EnhSim is missing a source of Berserking procs.<br>
<br>
Maybe I'm just misunderstanding a game mechanic, but the three sources that would proc berserking show the following increases with a change in 50% Haste:<br>
<br>
White MH hits = 45%<br>
WF hits = 22%<br>
SS damage = 1%<br>
<br>
I guess my question is... how can that amount of an increase in the number of hits (remember that only Haste changed between sims) result in only a 2% increase in Berserking uptime?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

What we need now is someone to show that haste does actually have an effect on Berserking uptime.  This could be done simply be comparing two long parses just auto-attacking on a low level dummy without any weapon imbues on and without flurry if possible.  One parse would be with Windfury totem and the other without windfury totem since 20% haste should be enough to establish a difference in uptime.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">There is a big difference between all that and a massive castsequence macro that just hits your abilities in some semblance of an ideal priority rotation which is what you seem to be proposing.  What 10 abilities are you talking about anyway?  There are 4 abilities you could castsequence together; SS, LL, FS and ES.  Unless you going to stick Fire Nova in the sequence and watch it break when you don't have a fire totem active?  Also Fire Nova is your highest priority when there are multiple targets but your lowest priority when there is only one target, so are you going to make two sequences?  What if they glyph Fire Nova for a specific AoE heavy fight (like Anub), would that mean three separate castsequences?<br>
<br>
Notice what I said about melee range and ranged attacks in the other post.  Are you going to have people make a sequence with shocks and then bind another button for their shocks to use when they are out of range and their castsequence macro gets stuck on a melee attack or will you have them use a reset button to get back to Flame Shock and then refresh their Flame Shock unnecessarily because the macro is too dumb to know that it should hit Earth Shock instead?   One way they have a dumb macro costing them damage, the other way they have to bind the shocks anyway but then they aren't good at hitting those buttons since the macro made them lazy.  Unless you leave Flame Shock out of the macro but then that could be a nice chunk of lost damage.  Although that would solve the issue of the macro Flame Shocking things that are going to die too quick for the DoT to tick out at least. <br>
<br>
I like macros when they work well, just not when they only work well enough.</div>

</div>Alright, it's been a busy couple of days with work and other issues, so I apologize for not being able to address your points in a more timely fashion.  For starters, the '10 or so' abilities I was referring too are, in no particular order: Stormstrike, Flame Shock, Earth Shock, Lava Lash, Lightning Bolt, Chain Lightning, Magma Totem, Fire Nova, Spirit Wolves, Shamanistic Rage, Lightning Shield, Fire Elemental, Wind Shear.  Simply put, that is a LOT of abilities, and it is a list of ability that could be trimmed up with some very simple macros.<br>
<br>
For instance, you could combine LB and CL into a macro that lets you pick and chose which one you cast based on an alternate button press, shift or alt as you pointed out.  Such a macro would look something like:<br>
<br>
<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px">
	<div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom:0px"><img src="/web/20100225234123im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/chestnut/misc/code_html.gif" border="0"></div>
	<pre class="alt2" dir="ltr" style="
		margin: 0px;
		padding: 3px;
		border: 1px inset;
		width: 694px;
		height: 66px;
		text-align: left;
		overflow: auto">#showtooltip
/cast [modifier:shift] Chain Lightning;
/cast Lightning Bolt;</pre>
</div>This macro could also be applied to Lightning/Water shield, Flame/Earth Shocks, Magma Totem/Fire Nova etc etc.  I do not believe anyone is doubting the uses of these simple macros however, though they do help tremendously with 'quality of life' play styles in that you have vastly fewer buttons to use.  (Note, if there is a mistake in the syntax of the macro, then I apologize!  I'm doing everything from memory at work!)<br>
<br>
But even with these simpler macros, a priority rotation can be mighty cumbersome in any situation that requires you to juggle multiple game mechanics at once while staying in combat (Death and Decay or Mimiron Fires, Cosmic Smashes, Bonestorm etc).  The priority system requires a player to handle these situations AND correctly deduce (or follow SaA) the current best spell that is off cooldown.  But I have noticed that even SaA has its limitations, such as directing you to cast a Lava Lash when there is only 0.5 seconds left until SS_0 is off cooldown, etc.  In practice, I've found such circumstances to be a detriment to overall damage output in line with the old TBC WF timer issues.  <br>
<br>
And so, in many situations, I am very much advocating the use of a macro to automate certain aspects of a fight while still giving you enough flexibility to change things up on the fly.  I am NOT advocating a massive castsequence macro, in fact it is relatively simple one that incorporates our 'core' abilities into one macro while letting the player decide which 'randomized' abilities should be cast at the appropriate time, and juggle in their specific timer long timer abilities as needed:<br>
<br>
<table class="stg_table tborder"><tbody><tr class="alt2"><td>Core </td><td> Random </td><td> Specific</td></tr><tr class="alt1"><td>Stromstrike </td><td> Lightning Bolt </td><td> Hero/Lust</td></tr><tr class="alt2"><td>Flame Shock </td><td> Chain Lightning </td><td> Spirit Wolves</td></tr><tr class="alt1"><td>Earth Shock </td><td> Lightning Shield </td><td> Shamanistic Rage</td></tr><tr class="alt2"><td>Lava Lash </td><td> *Magma Totem </td><td> Magma Totem</td></tr><tr class="alt1"><td>Fire Nova </td><td> *Fire Nova </td><td> Fire Elemental</td></tr></tbody></table><!-- table generated by StG's vB Code [table] v.0.1.6.0 (stable) o.95 --><br>
So with that in mind, you logically would want to build a cast sequence macro that accurately utilizes our core damage abilities while maintaining a certain level of flexibility so that you could incorporate any ability that is heavily randomized in usage, or any ability that is on a specific duration.  Such a macro would look like this:<br>
<br>
<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px">
	<div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom:0px"><img src="/web/20100225234123im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/chestnut/misc/code_html.gif" border="0"></div>
	<pre class="alt2" dir="ltr" style="
		margin: 0px;
		padding: 3px;
		border: 1px inset;
		width: 694px;
		height: 66px;
		text-align: left;
		overflow: auto">#showtooltip Stormstrike
/startattack
/castsequence reset=3/combat Stormstrike, Earth Shock, Fire Nova, Lava Lash, Stormstrike, Flame Shock, Fire Nova, Lava Lash;</pre>
</div>This macro ensures that you will be casting your primary damage dealing abilities on average once every 8 seconds, while also allowing you one or two free GCD to cast any random or specific ability as the situation warrants.  The beauty of such a macro is that it really does not matter WHEN you incorporate those R/S abilities, as any time lost in one block of the macro will be made up with the extra time in the second block of the macro.  It will also reset itself after 3 seconds of no use, essentially allowing you a worry free reset should you need to move in and out of combat.<br>
<br>
There is no issue with Magma Totem, as you can cast or recast that ability as time permits or when you need to move your totems, etc.  Undoubtedly, you will worry about clipping the last tick of your Flame Shock, but due to how many extra random abilities you end up casting, more often than not, the Flame Shock dot is allowed to run its full duration before being refreshed.  This macro allows you to consolidate 5 of your abilities into one button, which frees up several hotkeys.<br>
<br>
Obviously this is not a one shoe fits all situation.  For instance, if you were to find yourself in a situation in which you need to cast Fire Nova more often, you could make a second macro without Fire Nova in the castsequence and free cast it the moment it is off cooldown:<br>
<br>
<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px">
	<div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom:0px"><img src="/web/20100225234123im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/chestnut/misc/code_html.gif" border="0"></div>

		overflow: auto">#showtooltip Stormstrike
/startattack
/castsequence reset=3/combat Stormstrike, Earth Shock, Lava Lash, Stormstrike, Flame Shock, Lava Lash;</pre>
</div>And what if you decide you want to cast a shock far more often than once every 8 seconds, as some combat reports indicate:<br>
<br>
<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px">
	<div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom:0px"><img src="/web/20100225234123im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/chestnut/misc/code_html.gif" border="0"></div>

		text-align: left;
		overflow: auto">#showtooltip Stormstrike
/startattack
/castsequence reset=3/combat Stormstrike, Earth Shock, Fire Nova, Lava Lash, Earth Shock, Stormstrike, Fire Nova, Lava Lash, Flame Shock;</pre>
</div>Remember, we are not the only class that has a separate priority situation for AoE or single target situations (thinking about DKs...) so obviously you would need some skill in deciding what macro is appropriate for each situation.<br>
<br>
<b>I also feel compelled to point out that even the 'simulator' works itself into a cast sequence groove.  Today at work, I ran 20 test using the default config file located in the 1.9.3.2 simulator and found that without exception and down to the 1/100th of a PPM (+-0.01 of course) that it uses the same abilities an equal ammount of time per minute over the course of the full 5000 hour test.  With as random as our abilities ours, this is simply impossible.</b><br>
<br>
This is just a basic overview of what I was suggesting, and I will be happy to address any and all concerns, questions or comments you or anyone else may have.  I also invite ANYONE to pit the above macro against SaA against a target dummy at your leisure.  I'm curious to see how it stacks up <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100225234123im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":)" class="inlineimg"><!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1497106"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Your macros are awful because they include ranged and melee abilities in the same sequence.  Macro has sequenced to SS but you are outside of melee range, it won't ever move to shock or fire nova.  <br>
<br>
Also the 3 second reset is a horrible choice since if you started off with your SS (which is bad since you start outside of melee range so you can't do anything till you get into melee range) and then Shocked but then were forced to move for 3 seconds the macro has now reset but SS is still on cooldown for another 2 seconds, meaning you are standing there with your dick in your hand wanting to use an ability but the macro is stuck.  <br>
<br>
What about if your fire totem gets killed?  Your sequence hits Fire Nova but can't move on since Fire Nova can't cast without a Fire Totem.<br>

Hunter macro sequences worked since all the abilities they were macroing were ranged.  Macroing ranged and melee abilities together just really isn't smart and adding an ability that is dependent on there being a specific totem in play and in range is just awful.<br>

</div>I never said only push the macro at the expense of all other buttons.  I stated very clearly that a macro is useful to automate your rotation in certain circumstances, but that you are of course free to use an ability outside of any macro castsequence that you have set up.<br>
<br>
Do you routinely go wild and start pressing spells at the start of a fight or do you give the tank time to set up position and maybe throw a flame shock at the mob at the start before starting to attack?  Perhaps you are advocating refreshing your Lightning Shield when its at 9 stacks (as it should be before entering combat) or correctly placing your totems.  Just because you can push a button to blow a GCD does not mean that you SHOULD push a button to blow that GCD, especially when it is not needed.<br>
<br>
You also seem to have selectively ignored the fact that the next spell can be cast from ranged, and that you obviously have the option of manually casting LS, LB, CL, SR, SW etc.  By the time you are at the point of needing to use Lava Lash you are either already back in melee range (which makes your example uesless) or you have ALREADY used your non-melee limited cooldowns and with nothing left to blow, are not wasting any dps opportunities.  And let me point out that as long as you press the button once within 3 seconds it will not reset on you, and so being out of melee range for a second or two will not adversely affect your damage any more than having to move out of a fire, or avoid a shock, or stand behind an ice block or click on a portal et al.  Perhaps you would feel more comfortable with a manual reset button?<br>
<br>
And the fire totem?  Really?  The Magma Totem is not even included in the macro!  You are free to recast or refresh magma totem at ANY point during a fight, even in the middle of your castsequence.  That is a straw man argument, and I question your motivation for trying to include such a basic mechanic into the fight needlessly.<br>
<br>
Now I did take the time to read that post, and some of the points were valid and others are not.  We have vastly more tools at our disposal than the 4 a Hunter had at that point, but I do feel we tend to overly complicate our rotation just for the sake of overly complicating it (remember your example of how LL_QE and SS_0 seemed to add no dps in the simulator?).  A few 1 hour tests I ran on the last build of the PTR for 3.3 showed equal or better performance with the castsequence when compared to a correctly set up priority system with SaA, can you afford to so easily dismiss this setup without at least TRYING them in game?<br>
<br>
<b>Lastly, let me make one major point: the simulator doesn't allow for out of melee range time in a fight.  It assumes that you are in melee range and do not have to move 100% of the time.  If you are concerned about my castsequence macro being unrealistic, then you are ignoring the fact that the simulator is equally being unrealistic.</b>  I am only advocating a less random system for dealing damage in actual in game combat for newer players, not for advanced ones siming over thousands of hours attacking a targeting dummy.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Go post your macros on the Shaman forums at worldofwarcraft.com as those are the forums where a shaman new to enhancement should go first to start to learn how to play.  This is where they are supposed to go once they already have a clue and want to learn how to go further.<br>

Comparing macroed usage to sim activity is also useless:  the sim is to help get an idea of what we're looking for, not a replacement for actual play.<br>

Klillestol, your link is broken, because you copied the link text rather than the link location, and the EJ boards shorten the link text.  Can you fix so I can see the post?<br>

</div>As I believe someone mentioned earlier, these provide enough convenience to outweigh the slight, if any, DPS loss.  Since I'm also raid leading and trying to call things out so people who have problems with tunnel-vision don't get stomped on, these have helped a bit, especially the FS/ES macro that helps me from accidentally clipping the last tick of FS.  Everything else however, is keybound and non-macroed - fights are much too situational for macros to become too complex.  Anything more and they start becoming crutches.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

The point the guy was making was that those macros are actually a <i>convenient</i> way of having to press less buttons during boss fights while accomplishing pretty much everything you can do with multiple keys.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>This sums it up for me......its personal choice, lets leave it at that. Its good that people can share ideas about how they deliver the science of what is discussed and researched here. God forbid the day when this game delivers Max dps just by Macro's alone; a part of me will die. They are just extensions to the game that you make a choice about using based on <b>your</b> preferences, same things apply to all Addons and which ones you choose. I always look with interest to see what other players are doing to see if by doing something they do it can improve me as a player. There are plenty of places to share macro information on this and other sites. I use only the startattack/stormstrike one...thats my choice. Every other ability is key or mouse button assigned. Works for me and I have no problems. I use SaA and Forte to help me decide what I might do next and I combine this with situational awareness as to whats going on around me and sometimes end up ignoring both. This is what makes the game for me, this is why I play it. Every time trying to do better than I did last time. Better could mean more dps and in some cases staying alive :P<br>
<br>
One observation I do make is that the number of choices I have to make at the moment seems to be increasing, FS and FN added recently to what I may choose to do. The total number of damage components we have that make up our overall dps is in my opinion too high. We must have one of the highest (numerical count) set of damage componenets when compared to other classes.<br>

Here's my three highest DPS from previous attempts (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100317014748/http://www.worldoflogs.com/reports/av7sv5hulcymeyi1/sum/damageDone/?s=6401&amp;e=6886" target="_blank">1</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100317014748/http://www.worldoflogs.com/reports/av7sv5hulcymeyi1/sum/damageDone/?s=6401&amp;e=6886" target="_blank">2</a> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100317014748/http://www.worldoflogs.com/reports/av7sv5hulcymeyi1/sum/damageDone/?s=5616&amp;e=6053" target="_blank">3</a>) and, sadly, there's a decent amount of additional comparative data there as well.<br>
<br>
Then we went and one shot him on my first attempt with the build so, while I'm not complaining, I'm admittedly kinda stuck with only <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100317014748/http://www.worldoflogs.com/reports/rt-1pkbgre5ul0ht6ah/sum/damageDone/?s=1004&amp;e=1410" target="_blank">one point</a> of comparison.<br>
<br>
There are two pretty huge caveats here I'm going to list in order:<br>
<br>
1) the possible DPS gain I can see, and I'm not a statistical analyst so I'm just going with what it tells me, is only about 200-300 points in my gear. If you're not finding yourself overriding the queue to keep LS up, then it may be of less interest to you<br>
<br>
2) I don't remotely consider this a general purpose build. On any fight with movement (chasing adds, novas, etc), there's lots of lulls to keep LS up in and your ability to maximize output from FN to compensate is limited. This is strictly targeted at a Patch/Saurfang style fight where you can stay stationary and take full advantage of everything that comes before LS.<br>
<br>
3) the only difference between the two sets of data is that I had FS Glyph on the first and WF on the second. I've never seen WF account for that big of a difference when siming, but don't want to leave that out.<br>
<br>
I just got a bunch of upgrades, and am kinda hoping I'm not going to have as many chances to make comparison runs in the future nor likely to be able to keep the gear set quite as static, so I don't think I'm going to be able to really advance the case more than it's at right now.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Interesting prospect, but looking at my recent parse from Koralon (Just as an example of a straightforward fight where buff uptimes should be as high as possible, no variables, etc.) (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100317014748/http://worldoflogs.com/reports/rt-tyv3gh7lq3k8xxkv/analyze/dd/source/?s=535&amp;e=649" target="_blank">World of Logs - Real Time Raid Analysis</a>), my average LS damage per hit is about 1813 damage. Assuming I refresh it at 1 stack, which is generally how it turns out, I get about 14k damage from one GCD. That's a very good return for one GCD, more damage than any other spell except maybe a WF triple- or quadruple-crit, and I wouldn't like to miss that at all.<br>
<br>
Now, how important refreshing LS is is up for interpretation. You're not losing that entire 14k damage by not refreshing it immediately, maybe just a couple procs, so I usually put it right above LL on the priority list and try not to go too long without it. But I seriously wouldn't lose Static Shock for anything, it's a great, near-free damage talent. Being near-GCD starved, those two points in Reverb wouldn't really do much, and an extra 6% intellect is almost nothing in terms of AP.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>This is exactly the situation the simulator was designed to address as there is too much variation between individual raid parses for objective analysis.<br>
<br>
Running my normal build through the sim on a tank/spank situation shows as 8663.47 dps<br>
Changing my build to your spec and removing Lightning Shield from the priority list shows as 8421.12 dps<br>
<br>
Static Shock may not seem like much of a dps boost but it is significantly better then any of our other talent option when you get to that point.  It's worth roughly 1% dps per talent point where as Ancestral Knowledge is worth 0.02% dps per point and Reverberation is worth 0.2% dps per talent point.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">This sums it up for me......its personal choice, lets leave it at that. Its good that people can share ideas about how they deliver the science of what is discussed and researched here. God forbid the day when this game delivers Max dps just by Macro's alone; a part of me will die. They are just extensions to the game that you make a choice about using based on <b>your</b> preferences, same things apply to all Addons and which ones you choose. I always look with interest to see what other players are doing to see if by doing something they do it can improve me as a player. There are plenty of places to share macro information on this and other sites. I use only the startattack/stormstrike one...thats my choice. Every other ability is key or mouse button assigned. Works for me and I have no problems. I use SaA and Forte to help me decide what I might do next and I combine this with situational awareness as to whats going on around me and sometimes end up ignoring both. This is what makes the game for me, this is why I play it. Every time trying to do better than I did last time. Better could mean more dps and in some cases staying alive :P</div>

</div>I love reading about people using macros and I know that most of this community is generally for using SS+LL in a macro with /startattack. However, I prefer the macro I've created, which is listed below, that incorporates shocks and I have never seen a castsequence macro like it to this day. Also I will admit that I lose a few Lava Lashes from time to time, but I believe that dps is easily made up by the efficiency of the macro. The arguments about being out of range I do not feel are warranted due to MW and now FN and SR or SW, using a gcd at range when needed provides the same dps later in melee due to already having used it.<br>
<br>
I will explain the macro a bit and the use behind it but I'm sure their will be flames about how i'm "losing" dps, but I know for a fact that I do pull some of the best enh numbers in the world (thx to wmo and wol) AND I can consistently pull within 200dps of where the sim tells me I should be at(bearing in mind fight mechanics and no fire ele yet). Because of this I love my little macro, and I know by freeing me up a little bit it helps me play better.<br>

</div>First line is just keeping my engineering proc on cd.<br>
Second line... shouldn't need to explain.<br>
<br>
Reset = 10 is needed because well its the end of the macro and it needs to go back to the beginning, even when using all my other abilities within the macro It never skips the last shock.<br>
<br>
Reset = shift Very needed and i reset it all the time, most of the time its because when it gets to the second shock sometimes LS uses up all SS debuffs so i reset because no ES_SS but if their is debuffs than i let it go.<br>
<br>
You'll notice this is a 2/3/2 macro 2 SS's 3 ES's 2 LL's. This takes full advantage of reverb which in my single target dps spec I have 2 of which is enough to not be waiting on the second ES when SS comes up for the second time.<br>
<br>
Their is no FS in here obvs... Its cause I don't' use it anymore. I feel that without the FS Glyph it doesn't provided enough dps more than ES to outweigh the complexity of adding it to our rotation especially considering the potential for mistakes (clipping and mobs dieing), and with Fire Nova and Ele Glyphs I rarely have a 3rd glyph thats only 60-80dps. Some fights I use SS/SW/FN, others its, SS/Ele/FN.<br>
<br>
Oh and I also am the Primary Raid Leader for my guild, and as a result I cannot keep my head buried in my rotation. I need to be able to see everything that is going on with the fight and using my system helps me do this greatly.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Your macro isn't horrible but I will question one thing and leave it at that because I really think this is outside the realm of what should be discussed in these forums.  What did you do for Faction Champs and what do you do on any fight where you want to snare something from range?<br>
<br>
Personally while learning Faction Champs I went in with a PvPish spec and used Frozen Power on many occassions to root one of the melee when they were chasing someone.

I thought about making up and using a similar macro when they removed the interrupt from Earth Shock but what stopped me was the utility of the other shocks.  Your macro might help when a fight is fully on farm and you just want to coast through it or maybe it helps because you can't spare the attention while raid leading but I don't raid lead and keeping my shocks separate is one of the things I can do to help us get that first kill.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>When we first started heroic faction champs frost shock did help kite certain adds and when I do need to use it I have certain keybinds reserved for "fight specific spells" Using it over ES I reset the macro in which case I lose 1 lava lash, but since I never Frost Shocked more than 2-3 times per fight in the early Faction Champs days it wasn't a huge dps loss. Now days I actually wind shear a focus target like a paladin while purging and dpsing the primary kill target and I use several different macros to accomplish this including my primary dps one. As far as Kiting is concerned we have specific people who slow / cc the melee targets in faction champs and my frost shocks are almost never needed.<br>
<br>
As far as going into a fight for the first time I personally know exactly whats going to happen even the first time (its my job as the strat developer and raid leader). So any spell or modification of a macro Is 80% known before I enter any new fight.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1499325"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->the only thing with macros is that our spec is debuff/proc based. Debuffs and procs change what you should be doing to any mob or boss in any fight. I do find a macro useful for fights in which fps is a problem, but it is still a dps loss.<br>
Not to mention when you switch targets your debuff isn't on the new target and you lose out on increased damage from your ablities, if say your SS is off c/d and your using a macro that is at say an ES or MW5 proc. <br>
<br>
As for first time fights, reading and watching strats on them is different than actually doing the fight... game mechanics change or are buggy, as well as not everything is covered.

		<div id="post_message_1500110"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Has anyone suggested a priority order for AOE heavy fights?  I've been running with 2 points in FN since the patch and there are plenty of good opportunities for AOE testing in there.  The rep grinding trash in ICC is very AOE heavy.  Pugs have the habit of pulling multiple groups (gotta love pugs) which is OK if the tanks are on the alert and makes for pretty awesome AOE.  <br>
<br>
I think the order I've been doing is something like SW, SR, MT, MW5_CL, FN, ES_SS, SS, ES,...<br>
<br>
So basically prioritizing the AOE effects above the single target effects.  I'm not running out of mana on the sometimes epic AOE pulls, which are sometimes long enough to really test that issue out.<br>
<br>
Anyway it is certainly different from single target priority and would be good to hear if this is consistent with other people's findings.  <br>
<br>
This is the first time I can ever remember being near the top of the charts on an AOE fight.  Who would expect to see an enhancement shaman at the top of a 25-man chart for an AOE pull.  /lol  <br>

Our coders are working on adding a second priority list that would become active for the AoE portions of fights in EnhSim but there have been a lot of things that have needed adjustments lately so it has moved down on the priority list just a bit.  Besides it's really not hard to set up the sim for varying numbers of targets with 100% presence to determine how you should prioritize abilities for those occassions.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>The point that Ryethe is getting at is that there's more to Lava Lash than it's single damage entry in a log.  It's everything that he mentioned as well as an extra Flametongue hit with every use.  The first parse has an average Fire Nova damage of 3851 with an average Lava Lash of 2794 and Flametongue of 781.  The DPS difference between the two abilities for raw log damage is now 276 in favor of Fire Nova.  This isn't a perfect way of figuring out Lightning Shield damage, but 23 Lava Lash hits with 9% chance to proc an orb would result in another 146 damage/cast of Lava Lash.  There is now a 130 damage/cast gap between the two abilities without any of the unquantifiable log procs factored in.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I've been cheerfully using the default SAA lineup without editing, but it would be wonderful to be able to swap on the fly to an AE priority (right now I just ignore it and go back to manually hitting abilities when they're up, using it mostly to track MW5).</div>

		<div id="post_message_1501553"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Has anyone done any further in game (or out of game) testing with Berserking/Black Magic versus Berserking/Berserking?<br>
<br>
I will be going back to ICC 25 tonight, and I am seriously considering testing this combination out.  I'm not a math major, but using a little napkin math and a little common sense, Black Magic on the OH seems likely to be the better choice to me.<br>
<br>
Here is some of my reasoning behind my conclusion:<br>
<br>
1) The best estimates I have seen puts Black Magic at an average of 70 Haste... this seems accurate considering that parses I have seen show the enchant coming in at 25-30% uptime.  EnhSim shows my OH berserking uptime at 30% (which seems high to me), which 400 AP X .30 comes out to an average of 133 AP.  This puts the two very close to each either in EP, since 2 AP is very close to 1 Haste at most levels of gear.<br>
2) I wonder if the sim doesn't overestimate OH uptime for Berserking for a number of reasons.  First of all, my parses show my total uptime of berserking at around 40-50% for most fights, while the sim shows a total of 70% (40%/30%).  However, evaluating a DW berserking setup for uptime through parses is nearly impossible because they can both proc simultaneously.<br>
3) I believe Black Magic has an increased opportunity to proc compared to Berserking on the OH.  Besides SS, LL is the only instant attack ability that can proc an OH (melee based) weapon enchant.  Black Magic can proc off a large number of our (mostly ranged, compared to all melee) abilities.  If I understand the proc correctly, it should be able to proc off any Shock (and possibly FS ticks?), lightning spell, Fire Nova, FT weapon attack (it's a spell), and possibly more (LS procs, Magma ticks?).  Due to the more limited number of chances to proc Berserking from the OH, I think there's a much larger chance of going several seconds past the internal CD without proc'ing it when compared to Black Magic.<br>
4) Black Magic inherently increases the chance of Berserking to proc on the MH by delivering increased WF hits, white hits, and SS opportunities.  Dual Berserking doesn't have a symbiotic relationship, one enchant proc'ing has no effect on the other.<br>
<br>
Edit: FYI.. some more napkin math:<br>
Chance MH Zerk is up: .40 * 100% = 40%<br>
Chance OH Zerk is up at the same time: .30 * 40% = 12%<br>
Chance OH Zerk is up and MH Zerk is not: .30 * 60% = 18%<br>
<br>
Total uptime a parse would show = 58% (the last 12% is overlap)<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>OH berserking is actually about the same as MH, 40%+ depending on your gear/haste. The reason logs show lower uptime of berserking is because world of logs and others only count the total uptime of berserking and do not split it into two procs (think about it, why should it?). So, logs do not account for times when you have both enchants procced at the same time and is where the observed disparity is. The sim's at the moment are correct in modelling berserking. The added uptime of +70 haste (you can easily test this) has no bearing on the proc rate of berserking beyond what 70 haste does on gear. Berserking/Berserking is the winner here.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">OH berserking is actually about the same as MH, 40%+ depending on your gear/haste. The reason logs show lower uptime of berserking is because world of logs and others only count the total uptime of berserking and do not split it into two procs (think about it, why should it?). So, logs do not account for times when you have both enchants procced at the same time and is where the observed disparity is. The sim's at the moment are correct in modelling berserking. The added uptime of +70 haste (you can easily test this) has no bearing on the proc rate of berserking beyond what 70 haste does on gear. Berserking/Berserking is the winner here.</div>

</div>I will retest a little later to be sure, but when I run my sims it clearly shows MH enchant uptime at 40% and OH enchant uptime at 30%.  Am I the only one who gets results like this?<br>
<br>
I noted in my OP and my edit that a parse is difficult to measure due to the chance of both procs being active at once.  However, if your claim is that OH zerking uptime and MH zerking uptime are both 40%, I believe we should be seeing total uptimes that are higher than I have observed in my own parses and others:<br>
<br>
MH Zerk Uptime: .40 * 100 = 40%<br>
OH Zerk Uptime while MH Zerk is active: .40 * .40 = 16%<br>
OH Zerk Uptime while MH Zerk is inactive: 40% - 16% = 24%<br>
<br>
Total Beserking uptime a parse should show = 64%<br>
<br>
So, the disparity you are talking about accounts for a 16% overlap, but 64% uptime still seems high compared what most of us are seeing in practice, even on tank and spanks.<br>
<br>
Also, I thought we already covered that Haste does increase Berserking procs in a previous post (although it's possible that 70 Haste is unobservable)?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Observed uptime is around 60-65% on many logs I have seen for saurfang (really the only single target encounter we can use at the moment). I am getting 55% on main hand, and 50% on offhand, and am using 22% unbuffed haste (with a haste totem), my observed uptime should be quite high tonight (I was using black magic last week). <br>
<br>
70 haste is not enough to affect berserking to the degree you are talking about. In this post: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100214173643/http://www.mmo-champion.com/class-shaman/enhancement-berserking-v-black-magic-%28update%29/msg1901337/#msg1901337" target="_blank">Mmo-Champion</a>, I show that it is about 5% haste when berserking pulls ahead of black magic on the OH in the default config. 5% haste is ~150 haste.<br>
<br>
It is entirely possible at lower levels of haste (and thus lower berserking uptime) 70 haste may be enough. If the answer is "depends on your gear and set-up" I wouldn't be surprised.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Just did some glyph testing and was mildly surprised with the results. With my config the highest glyph setup was SS, FS, FSh as opposed to the more conventional SS, FS, WF. Has anyone else noticed that the Flameshock glyph is actually higher dps in their configs?<br></div>

</div>It was noted back when Flame Shock's DoT duration was increased.  Issue is it depends on perfect uptime of the DoT and 4T9.  Lose either one of those and the other options are better.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">When we first started heroic faction champs frost shock did help kite certain adds and when I do need to use it I have certain keybinds reserved for "fight specific spells" Using it over ES I reset the macro in which case I lose 1 lava lash, but since I never Frost Shocked more than 2-3 times per fight in the early Faction Champs days it wasn't a huge dps loss. Now days I actually wind shear a focus target like a paladin while purging and dpsing the primary kill target and I use several different macros to accomplish this including my primary dps one. As far as Kiting is concerned we have specific people who slow / cc the melee targets in faction champs and my frost shocks are almost never needed.<br>
<br>
As far as going into a fight for the first time I personally know exactly whats going to happen even the first time (its my job as the strat developer and raid leader). So any spell or modification of a macro Is 80% known before I enter any new fight.</div>

</div>Vyxnol, did you ever think about flipping your macro around?  Instead of SS, ES, LL, ES, SS, LL, ES have it run SS, LL, ES, SS, ES, LL, ES.  It's the same ratio of abilities <i>(it's just starting at the second SS in your macro and running from there)</i> and it opens up additional utility by letting you use a different shock and then just resetting the macro without any worries about it getting locked up on an Earth Shock.<br>
<br>
So then you could open with a Flame Shock while heading into melee range and then just start spinning the macro wheel when you get there.  Could also Flame Shock whenever the DoT runs off on a boss and then just reset the macro and it will keep running without getting locked on a Earth Shock.  Would also free you to use Frost Shock whenever you needed to snare something.<br>
<br>
It would still require people to bind the other shocks and to use their heads but would free that portion of their rotation while in melee range when there is no reason to use anything other then Earth Shock.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Observed uptime is around 60-65% on many logs I have seen for saurfang (really the only single target encounter we can use at the moment). I am getting 55% on main hand, and 50% on offhand, and am using 22% unbuffed haste (with a haste totem), my observed uptime should be quite high tonight (I was using black magic last week). <br>
<br>
70 haste is not enough to affect berserking to the degree you are talking about. In this post: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100214173643/http://www.mmo-champion.com/class-shaman/enhancement-berserking-v-black-magic-%28update%29/msg1901337/#msg1901337" target="_blank">Mmo-Champion</a>, I show that it is about 5% haste when berserking pulls ahead of black magic on the OH in the default config. 5% haste is ~150 haste.<br>
<br>
It is entirely possible at lower levels of haste (and thus lower berserking uptime) 70 haste may be enough. If the answer is "depends on your gear and set-up" I wouldn't be surprised.</div>

</div>Interesting, I hadn't run sims since EnhSim was updated recently, so I decided to first run a sim with the old version before I updated and ran it again with the updated Berserking proc mechanics.  Here is what I found:<br>
<br>
Older Berserking proc mechanics (11% melee haste):<br>
MH Uptime = 40%<br>
OH Uptime = 33%<br>
Average combined uptime (40%*33%) = 13.2%<br>
Average single proc uptime (40% + 33% - 26.4%) = 46.6%<br>
WOL expected average uptime (46.6% + 13.2%) = 59.8%<br>
<br>
Newest EnhSim version (same gear):<br>
MH Uptime = 51%<br>
OH Uptime = 46%<br>
Average combined uptime (51%*46%) = 23.5%<br>
Average single proc uptime (51%+46%-47%) = 50%<br>
WOL expected average uptime (23.5% + 50%) = 73.5%<br>
<br>
I went through several of the top Enhance parses so far on WOL for Saurfang, since I like the fact that Enhance Shaman shouldn't move much or switch targets for the fight.  The highest statistical outlier I saw was 75% Beserk uptime, which would seem to confirm that the new proc mechanics are right, but the next closest was 68%, and I saw some parses with double Berserking that had uptimes around 50%, which is what we would expect to see when having just one enchant.  Keep in mind that technically, if the stars aligned right, well geared Enhance Shaman are reaching the possibility of 100% uptime for Berserk (I'm at 97%) if the stars aligned right (no double procs).  The 73.5% would just be an average expectation according to what Enhsim shows.<br>
<br>
It seems like the uptime calculations for Berserking have somehow been adjusted too high in the most recent version.  As a side note, the highest damage parse for an Enhance Shaman on Saurfang used Berserking/Black Magic, and had a 58% Berserking uptime for that parse.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

If you want to say that the current mechanic EnhSim is using for Berserking is incorrect then go find yourself a dummy and beat on it for at least several hours to get us data reliable enough to show where the mechanic is wrong.

</div>I just don't have time to do that kind of testing immediately, which is why I looked at several (as in about 15) parses from WOL for some anecdotal data.  The fact that a parse goes over a short period of time lends itself to having some high statistical outliers, but I just didn't see them.  I was expecting to see some very high (as in 80%+) uptimes in at least some of the logs, but only saw one that hit the expected average of 51% MH/46% OH Berserking uptime (73.5%).  The uptimes I saw just don't seem to reflect the predicted uptime rates of EnhSim, even in parses where the DPS is likely near theoretical max and we should expect slightly higher Berserking uptimes.  That was my point.<br>
<br>
<br>
The link we looked at earlier has PPM rates much lower than 1.2 ppm for Berserking:<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I just don't have time to do that kind of testing immediately, which is why I looked at several (as in about 15) parses from WOL for some anecdotal data.  The fact that a parse goes over a short period of time lends itself to having some high statistical outliers, but I just didn't see them.  I was expecting to see some very high (as in 80%+) uptimes in at least some of the logs, but only saw one that hit the expected average of 51% MH/46% OH Berserking uptime (73.5%).  The uptimes I saw just don't seem to reflect the predicted uptime rates of EnhSim, even in parses where the DPS is likely near theoretical max and we should expect slightly higher Berserking uptimes.  That was my point.<br>
<br>
<br>
The link we looked at earlier has PPM rates much lower than 1.2 ppm for Berserking:<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Vyxnol, did you ever think about flipping your macro around?  Instead of SS, ES, LL, ES, SS, LL, ES have it run SS, LL, ES, SS, ES, LL, ES.  It's the same ratio of abilities <i>(it's just starting at the second SS in your macro and running from there)</i> and it opens up additional utility by letting you use a different shock and then just resetting the macro without any worries about it getting locked up on an Earth Shock.<br>
<br>
So then you could open with a Flame Shock while heading into melee range and then just start spinning the macro wheel when you get there.  Could also Flame Shock whenever the DoT runs off on a boss and then just reset the macro and it will keep running without getting locked on a Earth Shock.  Would also free you to use Frost Shock whenever you needed to snare something.<br>
<br>
It would still require people to bind the other shocks and to use their heads but would free that portion of their rotation while in melee range when there is no reason to use anything other then Earth Shock.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>My current macro is set to SS, ES, LL, ES, SS ,LL, ES.<br>
<br>
I agree that it would provide more utility but having LL go second would mean every time you reset the macro it would do LL over ES. Their are many reasons to go back to the beginning of the macro like reapplying SS in order to buff ES, also when other abilities are used in between certain parts of the macro the cd's get out of sync and thus you want to somtimes us another SS instead of waiting for ES to get off cd.... Because of this having the first 3 abilities be in the order of SS, ES, LL is very important cause its what our normal priority is.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Below is an attempt to explain the above a little better using a timeline diagram. </b><br>
<br>
S=Stormstrike<br>
E=Earthshock<br>
L=Lavalash<br>
A=Other Ability<br>
<br>
S--------E--------L-------------------------E---------S--------L----------E-------------------------------------Reset<br>
0~~~1~~~2~~~3~~~4~~~5~~~6~~~7~~~8~~~9~~~10~~~11~~~12~~~13~~~15~~~16~~~17~~~18<br>
<br>
The crude diagram above shows in a timeline where abilities are used in the macro assuming, 0 haste, 2 points in reverb, and using no other abilities in between the macro. You'll notice that the second SS starts after 8 seconds but in reality we have some haste which shortens gcd's and thus makes the macro more efficient.<br>
<br>
<br>
S--------A--------A--------E--------L--------------------------E----------S----------L----------E---------------Reset<br>
0~~~1~~~2~~~3~~~4~~~5~~~6~~~7~~~8~~~9~~~10~~~11~~~12~~~13~~~15~~~16~~~17~~~18<br>
<br>
Now in this example I've used 2 abilities before continuing the macro after the first SS. As a result Stormstrike would come off CD at 8 seconds but the macro wouldn't use it until almost 12 this is why the macro would need to be reset in order to keep everything on CD. <br>
<br>
<br>
If you needed to reset in between the 2nd and 3rd abilities to keep everything on CD you'd just be spamming Stormstrike and Lava Lash all day and not using shocks, this is why it has to stay SS, ES, LL.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1508267"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I've been keeping track of forums for the last few months and I finally got around to some simming myself. The thing that concerns me is Spec/Glyphs.<br>
<br>
Before moving forward I'd like to say that I don't know how to link the codes/parses I've ran as I'm not very computer savvy so it's off a limb here.<br>
<br>
With my current gear/gemming (Random Starks/AP/Haste gems here and there) the sim has shown me to have the highest dps when using LS glyph and flipping the 2 "free points" in reverb over to complete the 3/3 LS meanwhile in some thread somewhere Rouncer was speaking of how putting 1 point in EF and another in IMP SS and using a different glyph (don't remember off the top of my head) would optimize this persons DPS. My question is why there is so much variation between glyphs/spec when we're all following the same rotation?<br>
<br>
Also, when I run EP values for my gear it shows top three respectively to be Haste &gt; Crit &gt; Hit. There hasn't been very much talk of whether trying to maintain a critcap would be viable so I'm wondering why even in ToC/ToGC loot crit values so high.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1508274"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->The reason there is so much variation is that it entirely depends on your gear, even small changes in gear can significantly affect your stats/spec/glyph choices which is why relying on EP values is a bad idea. Its far better to ignore EP values and sim out each choice. New tools to automate this sort of simming are in the pipeline.<br>
<br>
To link your Sim results use the little # symbol above the edit window to add "code" tags into your message this will put your config file or results into a block with a scroll bar.<br>
<br>
Are you absolutely sure Haste. Hit and Crit are your top three EP values?? It sounds like you are doing something very wrong if they are. I'm shocked if AP is coming in 4th.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1508471"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->little off topic but I've been trying to find an update for Expertise stats.  Someone in my guild said in 3.3 expertise got changed &amp; that we needed a higher amount. <br>
The FAQ at MMO says 140 Exp rating. My in-game character sheet is at 124 Rating (29 Expertise), with talents buffed. But Rawr is saying I'm way over the cap but doesnt tell me where I need to be. <br>
<br>
Where can I find the latest stats for this or how much do I want?    (I refuse to use sims so please dont say to use it to find out.)<br>
<br>
thanks<br>
<br>
EDIT: ok, ive been told 140 rating needed, cool.  The 124 Rating isnt affected by the Orc racial, but the overal expertise is. 29 with axes, 24 with maces.    I'd have to stack all Exp gems to hit the 140 rating...   guess Im just kinda confused.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
And last I checked, as a dps, 26 expertise is where you want to be.<br>
<br>
Edit: To clarify. You just want your paper doll to say "26". Ignore the rating. It'll confuse you. With Axes you get +5 Expertise. So you'll need a lot less expertise rating then say a Tauren Shaman with the exact same gear.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Show me a parse and break it down so we can all see where the sim is "wrong".<br>
<br>
My last Deathbringer had me at 9484.9 dps.  That also includes the minor ancillary damage that occurs to the Blood Beasts from Magma Totem and Fire Nova.  Simming out my setup from that day with the same combat interval shows 9800.82 dps.<br>
<br>
<u>Dps(e): Parsed vs Sim</u><br>
Magma Totem: 298.9 v 300.31<br>
Spirit Wolves: 567.5 v 390.45 <br>
Fire Elemental: 681.9 v 882.74<br>
<br>
My wolves were lusted on one of the summons which explains the difference in their dps.  That difference would be even more profound if they had been Battle Shouted as well (only one warrior for that fight and commanding &gt; battle when everyone is already getting Might).  Fire Elemental is still a work in progress with lots of fixes incoming so the dps from it should be more inline with parsed data with the next patch.<br>
<br>
Biggest difference is just that the simulator makes better choices, faster then I can.  It has me firing an average of 35 lightning bolts and I only had 31 (2 being Chain Lightnings).  I was good with the Earth Shocks with the sim averaging 29 (rounding down) and I had 29.  It has me using Stormstrike 23 times and I actually used it 24.  Lava Lash and Fire Nova were the biggest discrepancies, I used LL 23 times and FN 25 times while the sim only used LL 21 times and FN 22 times.  I was also unlucky in that Windfury procced 2 times less then predicted by the sim.<br>
<br>
Overall the sim seems pretty much right on target to me, if it is inaccurate it would be that it might be overvaluing some things compared to what is obtained in-game.  It's hard to tell due to how much RNG is involved in a small a sample as a 4 minute combat parse.  But if you disagree with that assessment then, please, show us some real reproducible analysis about where the sim is inaccurate so we can work to make it better.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">If I had to guess, did you include your Orc racial? I believe orc get extra expertise when wielding Axes.<br>
<br>
And last I checked, as a dps, 26 expertise is where you want to be.<br>
<br>
Edit: To clarify. You just want your paper doll to say "26". Ignore the rating. It'll confuse you. With Axes you get +5 Expertise. So you'll need a lot less expertise rating then say a Tauren Shaman with the exact same gear.</div>

</div>To make it simple.  An orc dual wielding (using 2) axes needs 105 expertise rating to hit 26 skill. If you aren't dual wielding you will need the full rating required to get 26, which is 140. The orc racial is really only helpful if you are using 2 axes; if you are only using 1, you'll still have to gem the full 140 rating to make sure your other weapon is capped.<br>

You use magma and fire ele on Saurfang? I am afraid to pull aggro on the beasts on their initial spawn, but I am assuming ranged dps pulls aggro on them pretty much instantly.  Have you ever been melee struck by a beast though by using a chain or magma? And on that note, does chain hit them for the full damage, or is it considered AoE on them?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>It's 98 expertise rating not 105.  You need your mainhand capped no matter what but there is no reason to cap the offhand if the mainhand is getting there through the racial.  <br>
<br>
Magma Totem generates no aggro whatsoever besides the aggro generated by being a hostile entity.  Fire Elemental generates aggro that is attributed to the Fire Elemental, not you.  Fire Nova generates aggro directed at you but as they are mostly immune to AoE damage the aggro isn't an issue provided you don't use it the moment they go active and even then it shouldn't be an issue as most raids are using some other aggro generating technique to pull them away from the melee anyway.<br>
<br>
Chain Lightning hits the Blood Beasts for a full damage second/third bounces so that is something to use carefully.  Which is why I only cast two of them in the parse I mentioned since having the MW stacks ready when they are close enough to get hit by a bounce but already have enough aggro built on something else where I'm not worried about pulling didn't happen that often.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Sorry about the misconception about the rating, I guess I wasn't as up to date on the topic as I had thought.  But I do not understand this logic in the quote.  Why does offhand expertise not matter?  If you are using an axe main hand and a mace offhand, do you not need the 140 to cap your offhand so you do not have a chance to have your offhand dodged, or is it once your main hand is dodgecapped, your offhand automatically is?<br>
<br>
If it is the latter, I sure will feel foolish.  I've always been under the impression that for dual wield, each weapon required its own expertise cap to be reached.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1509140"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I'm confused by your terminology?  There are no "stepping stones".  There is just value.  Hit below the spell hit cap is worth about 3.6 EP per point.  Expertise below the dodge cap is worth about 2.7 EP per point.  That means that adding a point of those stats is worth more then spending it just about anywhere else.  <br>
<br>
In the situation where you can have one weapon capped and not the other you have to re-determine the value of capping that other hand keeping in mind that each point of expertise is doing nothing to help the hand that is already capped.<br>
<br>
If for some reason you ended up with a capped offhand (say you get that new offhand claw and have a mace) but the mainhand was uncapped the value of each point of  Expertise towards capping that mainhand is ~1.9 EP which means it actually is close enough that it should be simmed out to determine if it would indeed be worth gemming for that expertise or just to leave the mainhand uncapped.  Offhand uncapped expertise is only ~0.65 so it is not even worth the time to sim it out.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>It was determined quite a few months ago that expertise is not a truncating stat like the paper doll leads us to believe (I assume this is what you are referring to when you say "stepping stones" - us gaining expertise in .25% chunks on the paper doll). In other words, if you have the choice of having 139 expertise (1 rating below cap) or 149 (9 over), you are probably better being slightly under and not wasting those extra stat points, and using that for ap or haste or something. I don't have a link to the thread, but I promise the testing is on these boards.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">It was determined quite a few months ago that expertise is not a truncating stat like the paper doll leads us to believe (I assume this is what you are referring to when you say "stepping stones" - <b><u>us gaining expertise in .25% chunks on the paper doll</u></b>). In other words, if you have the choice of having 139 expertise (1 rating below cap) or 149 (9 over), you are probably better being slightly under and not wasting those extra stat points, and using that for ap or haste or something. I don't have a link to the thread, but I promise the testing is on these boards.</div>

		<div id="post_message_1509513"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->At the moment i have my 2 mana points in Improved Stormstrike, but in a 25man raid i never have mana issues so i could probably swap them both out without worrying about going out of mana. <br>
(i have tried swapping one of them out and putting it into Reverberation before and still didn't have any mana issues)<br>
<br>
But EnhSim shows that putting 1 or 2 extra points in Improved Shields and switching Lightning Shield glyph for Windfury gives me more DPS increase vs putting them into Reverberation.<br>
Anyone else have this? or is there some reason why that isn't a good option?<br>
<br>
<br>
Update!<br>
I took the 2 points i had in Improved Stormstrike and moved 1 into Elemental Focus and 1 into Improved Shields putting me at 2/3 on Imp.Shields and switched Lightning Shield glyph for Windfury glyph.<br>
I've only tested on dummy though and just had 1 test with the old spec with Imp.Stormstrike and 1 with the new spec, both 5 minutes.<br>
With the new spec i had like 300 more dps, i know RNG probably played a big part though, so it's probably not that accurate, but i'll do some more testing, hopefully in a raid soon...<br>
With mana totem up i was just about to run out of mana everytime before SR came off cd, but never ran out.<br>
So in a 25man raid i would probably be fine by putting the point in Elemental Focus into Imp. Shields aswell...<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1509759"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I have personally found it's not necessary for two points in mana regen talents. I use only one point in Imp SS and I have never gone OOM in a boss fight since 3.3 was released whether it be ToC, ICC, or even Ulduar. I do, however, occasionally run OOM on trash mobs due to using FN and CL everytime its off CD, but even then its a very rare occurrence.

		<div id="post_message_1509798"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Elemental Focus is more mana returned then Imp SS due to how Fire Nova works with the talent.  The reason you are running OOM on trash has nothing to do with your use of CL and FN but rather due to JoW.  Uptime of JoW on trash is less along with less time on target so you aren't getting the same mana returns from it and that is why you are running OOM.<br>
<br>
Hopefully this is something Blizzard will keep in mind when they drop us down to base mana for Cataclysm.  With JoW and significant time on target we are effectively mana free but without JoW we could have some serious issues.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>You don't need to expect it, it's already in the game.  Mental quickness converts 30% of our attack power to spell power.  Our attack power on gear is being replaced by agility, and our spell power is being replaced by intellect.<br>

		<div id="post_message_1510482"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Spellpower isn't being replaced by Intellect.  There will still be spellpower just as there will still be attack power.  It's just that there won't be any of it on the gear.  It will probably still be present on weapons because spellpower there is the equivalent of the weapon's dps increases for casters but for everything else it will be gone.  Easiest thing is just to look at strength pieces and apply the same logic to agility and intellect pieces.  The strength pieces don't have additional attack power on them because it would be redundant as strength equals attack power.  In cataclysm intellect will equal spellpower and agility will equal more attack power so it would be redundant for those stats to appear together on the same pieces.<br>
<br>
Our biggest issues going into Cataclysm will likely revolve around<br>
<br>
- loss of spell crit when we lose the intellect on our gear and how that will affect things like Elemental Devastation/Focus<br>
- dropping totems "freely" when limited to a base mana pool <br>
- JoW - will we end up dependent on that raid buff being present to be effective in a raid<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I know the motto here is "the Sim rules", but (a) these items are fairly new to Enhsim so I'm not sure how authoritative the results are, and (b) the BlS thread says Totem of the Avalanche. Rouncer suggested using both, but right now I can only afford one.<br>
<br>
I guess another thing that might worry me about Shattered Ice is that FS is somewhat peripheral to Enhancement, and if they tweak it again, it might drop out of our rotation, whereas SS is integral to us. Also, Haste is a flaky stat, which makes me worry that the better number that Shattered Ice is generating may change when my gear changes.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

SS is easy on the rotation, and also AP &gt; for AoE vs. pure Haste.  Longer term, you should probably consider both unless you cannot adequately keep up FS.  Use one for single target fights and the other for AoE fights.  You might be better off spending badges on 4pc and the trinket however, as the totems are relatively minor upgrades over the triumph totems.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>IMO the avalanche totem is a rather large upgrade over the lava lash totem.  Lava lash is chance on hit to proc 400, SS is guaranteed and more so, as you stated, SS is always in your rotation, whereas you may miss a lava lash for longer than its GCD. On top of that, I have had the SS totem proc to 3 stacks in 1 single SS (at the very least it gets to 2 stacks in 1 SS.  I dont think I have ever seen just 1 stack).  So the way the SS totem is worded, is misleading.  Hopefully this has been reported before though, and is already taken into account in enhsim.  If not, should be.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Testing it right now, I will edit this post when I get the results you/we are after.<br>
My belief is that since SS forces you to use both weapons, you are guaranteed at least 2 charges every time, and if you get a WF proc off the SS that is when you get your 3rd charge.<br>
<br>
Edit: never mind, seems I am late to the party as per usual.  rouncer: 300 heavyhands: 0.<br>
Was unable to reenact the 3stacks in 1 SS.  Chances are the buff was falling off as I SS'd, refreshing it at the last .second but making it look like it was a first proc.  At any rate, made myself look like a fool publicly again.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1511954"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->With Black bruise coming out tonight, what do we need to find out about it's proc mechanics for the simulator? Off the top of my head I would think;<br>
-Proc rate (believed to be 1%)<br>
-Where the proc can come from (all hits, only mainhand hits, white and or yellow hits)<br>
-Whether it is modified by E&amp;M/CoE/EP<br>
-Whether it is modified by spellpower (pretty much a longshot but in perusing some forums someone mentioned it might be so worth at least testing)<br>
-Whether there is any sort of ICD<br>
-A log of observed uptime in a raid setting<br>
-Whether spells or debuffs are triggering or benefiting from the buff. (Pallies are seeing their Bryn'Toll the Bone Arbiters proccing the lifesteal off corruption application, jugdements, judgement debuff application, righteous vengeance application in addition to their melee swings, CS and DS. If Black Bruise followed this trend then things like SS debuff would be possible triggers, as well as shocks [including their debuff/dots] lightning bolts, flametongue weapon effect etc.)<br>
Can anyone think of more to test or how to test these? I know some or all of these have been tested on the PTR but things may have changed before live.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
Aside from a standard test (1 hour naked except the weapon (no enchant) on a level 60 dummy, no procs, no buffs, no damage other than auto-swing and no windfury), there are some key things we need tested that are enhance specific (again on a level 60 dummy):<br>
<br>
-stand sideways to the dummy and stormstrike 200 times with no weapon imbues (or until you get a proc)<br>
-put on your offhand and stand sideways to the dummy then lava lash ~200 times with no weapon imbues (or until you get a proc)<br>
-Have a warlock friend keep CoE up on the dummy and test naked (except BB) for 10 minutes<br>
-Have a rogue or warrior keep up sunder/expose armor on the dummy and test naked (except BB) for 10 minutes<br>
-Test with your full gear and rotation for 10 minutes on the heroic level dummy (make sure no one else is around!)<br>
-Duel a disc priest and auto-attack while they keep up their absorption shields<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I'm not sure how accurate timestamps and logs are for concurrent events but I'm very curious if A) both hits have a chance to proc the effect and B) whether the SS debuff has a chance to proc the effect similar to the Bryntroll "bug" pallies are seeing with debuff placers from melee swings. unfortunately the only way to conclusively prove the debuff effect does is if you see a triple proc from a single SS or have a huge sample size and saw three times the proc rates on SS than on a naked 1handed test.<br>
<br>
The reason I bring up timestamps and logs is I'm wondering if they are accurate enough that a case of <br>
<br>
Storm Strike Cast.<br>
Mainhand hit for 2000.<br>
Offhand hit for 1000.<br>
Dummy gains Storm Strike.<br>
Hardmood gains Necrotic Touch.<br>
<br>
vs.<br>
<br>
Storm Strike Cast.<br>
Mainhand hit for 2000.<br>
Hardmood gains Necrotic Touch.<br>
Offhand hit for 1000.<br>
Dummy gains Storm Strike.<br>
<br>
Whether examples of these 2 cases would prove the debuff proccing the effect.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Looking at his parses the proc appears to have a wide range of effectiveness which lines up with the idea that it is an exceptionally low percentage proc.  His dps ranges from 54 to 97 when looking at single target encounters with high uptimes.  Loading the weapon into EnhSim (without the proc), then manually adding in 97dps and then comparing it to my 245 axe is showing Black Bruise as a definitive downgrade.  Basically if no one else wants it you should pick it up and then move it straight to your bank, don't even waste the gold enchanting it, and hope that Blizzard significantly buffs it and soon.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">It dropped for me tonight, so I will be doing a couple of these tests in a few hours (or whenever our raid finishes).<br>
<br>
Edit: I will have a combat log of Rotface up later, most likely WMO because that goes up first. I will also try post the zips for dummy-tests, but I may mess it up as I'm not the guy who logs for the guild.<br>
<br>
And it looks like we're doing 10 mans for the next hour or so. I shall log the entirety. <br>
<br>
Edit again: Rotface isn't up yet, but here is the WMO parse of the 10 man, from Deathwhisper to Rotface and Festergut. Trash is included. Apologies if anything's wrong, first time using the damn thing.<br>

</div>The reason we want the Lava Lash test is that it is an easy way to see if the effect procs from any melee attack, even ones originating with the offhand.<br>
<br>
Just stand sideways to the Dummy so autoattacks are not doing anything and start Lava Lashing.  If you get a single proc you can stop or if you get to 200 Lava Lashes without a proc you can stop as either condition tells us what we need to know about Lava Lash.<br>
<br>
That's also why I requested a comparison test with a shield equipped in the offhand, to see if it is proccing from melee attacks from either hand or only melee attacks from the mainhand + mainhand specials or mainhand melee attacks + all specials.  The Lava Lash test gives us an answer on offhand specials and the shield test (while requiring a lot more data to draw a proper conclusion) tells us about offhand melee attacks.<br>
<br>

		<div id="post_message_1512970"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Still need confirmation about offhand white attacks but does seem likely considering it procs off Lava Lash.  Biggest problem is that the proc rate is just way too low.  I'm seeing variances between 10% and 20% uptimes and that has to be due to the incredibly low proc chance.<br>

Just checked the log file and the buff can definitely refresh itself so there is no cooldown.<br>

From there we can bring it to the wow forums and maybe once they see how incredibly bad the proc is in it's current implementation maybe they will actually do something about it.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Yeah shouldn't be a problem, add this as part of what it needs to do so that the reminder is there when it gets coded. Always better to have these things tied up in an issue rather than splattered around various forum threads.<br>
<br>
Which by the way is a suggestion to others. YES we want your ideas for improvements to the sim but PLEASE don't send them as Private Messages to myself, I had 2 of them in last 48 hours.

One of the biggest risks we feel like we face currently is itemization becoming too stale and predictable where the only thing you get out of a new tier of content are the current item with a few more stats on it. <br>
<br>
Procs are one of the ways we’re trying to address this and we expect you’ll continue to see a lot more of them for the future. With any new feature, though, it’s going to take time to figure out which implementations succeed or fail. Also keep in mind that we know we haven’t always had the best track record with items that give up some of their stat budget for procs which is particularly true of casters. <br>
<br>
We aren’t ready to announce any specific changes at this time, but rest assured we do intend to tweak the procs over time. This is a model you’re likely to see a lot more of in future content.</div>

Not to derail this thread or bring in insane amounts of QQ, but it does seem that Blizz is aware of Bryntroll's strength and wants the other proc items in ICC to be at that level.  With the detailed feedback that the Enhance Shaman community provides to Blizzard, it would not surprise me if Black Bruise did in fact get a massive upgrade, as currently it appears to be one of the weaker proc weapons from ICC.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>This is a good point, and one that concerned me quite a bit. But with the current state of Combat rogues compared to Mutilate, and Mutilate rogues doing just as much magic damage as we do, then a buff to this weapon might not be such a bad thing to bring the specs a little closer together.<br>

</div>The /combatlog command will log what you need to the abovementioned file. It doesn't do filtering like the in-game display does. Once you're done just type /combatlog again to switch off logging, then you can go upload the file. After uploading, I'd advise moving or renaming the file (you'll need to exit wow to do so), otherwise any subsequent combatlogs will just append to the file.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I really wish I knew that before I did the 200 lava lash test I just did.<br>
<br>
Starting over.  Will edit this post with the tests.<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Alright, standing sideways to the level 60 totem, naked only wearing black bruise and hellscream (245) no weapon imbue, <b>only lava lashing</b>.  200 hits later, I had only received 1 proc.  The proc happened on laval lash #81.<br>

 I am fairly certain I screwed something up, so I took a screenshot of my recount as well.<br>

<br>
I figured out what I was doing wrong.  I was under the impression that doing /combatlog to turn it off reset the file, did not realize I had to manually delete the file.  Working on the SS test now.<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Repeated the test standing sideways, no weapon imbues, naked with shield in offhand, only storm striking.  After 200 stormstrikes, I have 10 procs.<br>

Taking a break from testing, I'm starving.  If anyone has any other test requests, let me know and I'll get right on it.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>61.7% melee appears to be a lot for me. In our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100120104350/http://www.worldoflogs.com/reports/rt-o73oo604xfam3j1t/sum/damageDone/?s=2020&amp;e=2262#Jaffnar" target="_blank">run yesterday</a>, I had 57.8% damage thru melee attacks (White, WF, SS, LL), a value which doesn't even include our fire totems and wolves. If we also keep those in mind, my effective damage thru melee attacks, which would be increased by Necrotic Touch, was only 48.7%. Well, there is some magic area damage in this log, but still combat rogues will have a significantly higher damage increase from Necrotic Touch, then Enhancement Shamans.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I'd wager a guess that our BiS list will have us close to crit cap, causing the Agi portion of the DBW proc to not be worth as much as it is now. At least I'd sim it before I say "leaps and bounds." <br>

				So, I just picked my calculator, took all numbers I could find here and found a proc chance (in %) series for Black Bruise of:<br>
2.7 2.8 3.1 3.3 3.7<br>
<br>
I didn't really (and couldn't) check which abilities have been used, but anyway...from those numbers (round about 10000 hits I'd guess) we'll get a mean of <b>3.1 +/- 0.4 %</b>. My (Fester)gut tells me that this <b>smells like a 3% proc chance of BB</b>. This is in general a very reasonable value, and I doubt a bit that Blizz started to use non-integer values like 3.5 or something.<br>
<br>
So I'd suggest this to be a first good guess for Enhsim to see if us Enhancers should roll for it or not...I still have a big problem with those logs, though. I'm missing the "Shadow Damage" from Necrotic touch. I somehow doubt that it is included in the overall melee damage....but whereelse should it be?

		<div id="post_message_1514923"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Hothgor's testing last night was sufficient to validate the proc rate for Black Bruise as ~2.75% off of hits from either hand when using 2.6 speed weapons.  <br>
<br>
Issue I just realized is that no one has done testing with a fast offhand to check if the proc rate is actually a ppm model where it will vary according to weapon speed or a set proc rate no matter the offhand speed (mainhand speed being defined by the weapon itself).  One of you lucky people with the weapon mind equipping a fast dagger in the offhand and doing 2k autoattacks on a dummy for me?  If the proc rate goes down (should drop to ~2%) when using the dagger that changes the Combat Rogue aspect of the equation a bit.<br>
<br>
(e) Sim is updated and functioning properly.  Compared it's results for Necrotic Touch to values from Extenze's Jaraxxus parse from last night and they are consistent.  Comparing some weapons shows it is now superior to the 245 heroic weapons from ToC but still inferior to the 258 weapons from heroic ToGC.  Both 264 weapons from ICC10 Heroic will beat the 258s (and the 264 BB) but the 277 Black Bruise will beat those (and that is just going off the 264 version's proc).<br>
<br>
So that works out to 277-BB &gt; 264 ICC10 heroics &gt; 258 ToGC-25 weapons &gt; 264-BB &gt; 251 ICC10 &gt; 245 ToGC-10 heroics &gt; 245 ToC-25<br>
<br>
Basically the weapon fits well into our itemization now, even if it is nothing like how well Bryntroll works for Ret/DKs.  Not sure we will see any additional changes as that may end up overpowering the weapon for Combat Rogues.  Although that will also depend on what we find out about how the proc rate interacts with offhand weapon speed.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>It is possible that the proc is treating Stormstrike as 3 melee hits instead of 2 (one being the application of the debuff) as that would be consistent with what we are seeing with Bryntroll and it would even out the slight inconsistency in the uptime comparing your results to what we are seeing from the sim.  Not sure how to check on that but if people keep running tests like that (longer = better) and it is consistently showing as a higher proc rate/uptime percentage the sim can always be adjusted to maintain accuracy.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
My current ranking's thing wasn't meant to be accurate, it was just meant to show roughly where Black Bruise currently falls so people have an idea of what the weapon should be worth to them.  It was also meant to show that the weapon is most likely close enough to the other options that it is unlikely to be buffed again so people should accept it as it is and not pick it up looking for another buff down the road.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">It is possible that the proc is treating Stormstrike as 3 melee hits instead of 2 (one being the application of the debuff) as that would be consistent with what we are seeing with Bryntroll and it would even out the slight inconsistency in the uptime comparing your results to what we are seeing from the sim.  Not sure how to check on that but if people keep running tests like that (longer = better) and it is consistently showing as a higher proc rate/uptime percentage the sim can always be adjusted to maintain accuracy.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
My current ranking's thing wasn't meant to be accurate, it was just meant to show roughly where Black Bruise currently falls so people have an idea of what the weapon should be worth to them.  It was also meant to show that the weapon is most likely close enough to the other options that it is unlikely to be buffed again so people should accept it as it is and not pick it up looking for another buff down the road.</div>

</div>While I understand you've already said that your ranking wasn't meant to be accurate, I just wanted to point out that Black Bruise can be an upgrade to ToGC25 weapons even with current gear sets based on the data seen in the updated sim:<br>

</div>So here's what I'm getting from this:<br>
<br>
- From that log it looks like it strikes with MH/OH about 50% of the time each. The fact that there are less OH strikes in that log might just be RNG. Unless the proc works in that it hits for 50% of whichever hand got the last proc, we'll have to try and figure that out too.<br>
- I counted 4615 physical hits that would proc the trinket (White, stormstrike, lava lash, windfury), and 2464 procs total (Anger Manifestation hits x8) which gave about a 53.4% proc rate for that log.<br>
<br>
Also on the list, whether or not these extra hits can proc WF, Flametongue, MW stacks, and Berserking.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Too short for WoL, sry - but lava lash CAN proc it. I made a small test for Stormstrike too, it seems it can procc off of both hits, not confirmed yet.<br>

<br>
I know, these tests aren't really scientifical, but it was enough for me to make first assumptions, so i share it here too. If you need exact tests for the EnhSim/Rawr please make detailed instructions and i will make run the tests as soon as possible<br>
<br>
//edit It seems this trinket is a little bit bugged. Sometimes it stacks and releases the "Mote of Anger"'s correctly but simply doesnt make the hit it should. There is also a bug with 2hand weapons referring to Dachef.<br>

</div>From that last log, you landed 310 MH attacks, and landed 19 manifest anger attacks.<br>
<br>
Looking at the buffs gained, you got 132 mote of anger, which is enough for 16 procs (with 5 leftover). I'm not sure what the discrepancy is there.<br>
<br>
In either case, you had 325 Flametongue procs, which is more procs than you had melee swings. So I'm assuming that the proc is actually triggering flametongue.<br>
<br>
I'm curious as to what's going on in the log that is causing the discrepancy though. Would like to see another test.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

50% chance to proc a stack for all melee strikes - Incl Stormstrike and Lava Lash<br>
When it hits 8 stacks it has a 50% chance to do a mainhand or an offhand melee white hit for 50% of normal damage.<br>
The additional hits can crit and will crit as normal melee hits for 200% damage.<br>
The additional hits proc weapon imbues (Windfury/Flametongue/Frostbrand) as if they were normal weapon strikes.<br>
They also can proc Flurry and Unleashed Rage and Maelstrom Weapon - treat them as additional white attacks.<br>
They will be subject to all effects that effect melee attacks - armor reduction, raid buffs and debuffs etc.

</div>I still need someone with Black Bruise to do a bit of additional testing so I can make sure that is being modeled correctly.  Looking for some testing with a fast offhand to see if it changes the general proc rate.  I would like some straight autoattacking on a dummy for 2000 hits.  Would also like someone to test Stormstrike to see if it is counting as 3 melee attacks instead of just two.  That would be done by standing sideways to a dummy and Stormstriking till you had at least several hundred Stormstrikes (1000 would be great).  Probably would be a good idea to do that testing in 4pc PvP gear for the cooldown reduction.<br>

</div>I would guess, that the Jar hits are yellow attacks, but I can't determine that in the posted logs, because none are versus the heroic test dummy. But if I'm right, it should be treated like a half-damage Stormstrike hit.<br>
<br>
The ability of the Jar hits, to proc all our stuff, should make us the premium user of this trinket. We have a rather high amount of melee attacks per time (I scored ~2 hits per seconds at Saurfang this week, while our Mutilate rogues with their 62% faster weapons only got 40% more hits), while using slow hard hitting weapons in both hands.<br>
<br>
About the triple Stormstrike effect. If we see this behavior also with Black Bruise, it could quite possibly be, that also a lot of other "on melee attack" procs including some trinkets, Berserking or even Maelstrom weapon and Windfury have this "bug".<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>It is possible that it will show up with Black Bruise considering there is a small discrepancy in the proc rate experienced for straight autoattacks and when a person is using their entire rotation.  We should be careful about inferring it to occur with anything else without some evidence to the contrary.<br>
<br>
Check out those log entries a bit more closely and you'll notice that the War Totem only gains two charges per stormstrike even while Tiny Abom gained it's impressive 3 stacks.<br>
<br>
There is no way that this applies to Windfury Weapon, there has just been too many tests run over the years for that much of a discrepancy to have been missed.  That is probably because it's effects are specific to the hand that it is applied to.  That logic would also apply to the weapon enchants like berserking and mongoose.   Maelstrom Weapon could probably use some additional testing however, so if someone wouldn't mind doing a sideways stormstrike series with no weapon enchants applied with either two same speed weapons or a single slow weapon (2-hander would be fine) it should be pretty easy to see if it is giving a bonus opportunity for a proc.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I also rock between 3k and 3.2k Spellpower raid buffed and in combat.  Currently I'm enjoying my Fire Nova spell critical striking for +5k.  I've spec'd 2/2 imp fire nova totem and 1/1 Elemental Focus and 1/2 Imp Stormstrike to maintain Fire Nova between Shamanistic Rage CDs.  I did try it, and the Glyph of Fire Nova is way overkill so I skipped that.  Unfortunately I had to sacrifice Reveberation, but I'm already gemmed for Attack Power since my gear is somewhat lacking.  This gives my fire nova quite a punch single target and it's devastating against multiple mobs.<br>
<br>
Depending on the situation, Magma Totem is my first/second priority spell now (MW_5 LB/CL being the only exception)and Fire Nova directly after to get the maximum number of Novas per MT cast.   Adopting this strategy was a significant DPS increase for me. I've seen my recount numbers during raids range from ~5-6k DPS on a single target to 10-11k DPS on ICC trash.  Of course, it's a work-in-progress with plenty of testing to do and mostly just fun to have a different play-style that is still effective.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

As for berserking, maelstrom etc. activating the proc for either BB or tiny abom I'd be surprised. The reason SS effect and flametongue have a chance to proc is that behaviour is mor in line with ret pallies' observations on Bryntroll's effects (I.e attacks that placed debuffs on the target along with regular or special melee attacks) and not attacks that placed a buff on ourselves. Still owrth testing but it would be counter intuitive. Also Bryntroll was nerfed for ret pallies and unholy DKs to only proc on straight melee hits so it is possible this change also happened for BB or can in the future.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Perfect, thank you.<br>
<br>
After we get that we should be good for both the BB and the Tiny Abom for at least a little while.  What we will want after that is for people to start comparing their Sim results with the weapons to what they are seeing in game.<br>
<br>
Best fights for that are Festergut and Saurfang, provided you are staying in melee range for the entire encounter.  Saurfang should be perfect for that (except for the short length of the encounter) because none of the ancillary damage to blood beasts from Fire Nova, Magma and Chain Lightning should have any effect on the dps shown by Necrotic Touch and Manifest Anger.  Because of the short durations you should expect some variation from the sim, the question is going to be one of significance.  <br>
<br>
Easiest way to deal with this is going to be for people to post very specific information for others to gather.  Sim out your set for that fight with the combat duration set to within 0.25 of a minute <i>(15 seconds - 3:17 = 3.25)</i> from your actual parse.  Variance should be set to 0% and run the sim for 5000 hours.  Then break it down as follows and people can start comparing results.  After a week or two we should have enough data to see if we need to tweak the simulators settings.<br>

</div>Very nice, thank you.<br>

So that's confirming the 3.3% proc rate that was seen earlier in the thread.  I re-opened the ticket at codeplex and asked Eralun to up the proc rate from 2.75 to 3.3 which hopefully will make it into the next iteration of the sim which will have Tiny Abom for testing.<br>

Berserking proccing it will have to be added to the sim as will the weapon priority aspect but before we get him messing with the code it would be helpful to figure out about FT as that would be a truly significant change.<br>

(edit)<br>
<br>
Also because this trinket is so hard to accurately model I'm going to ask for something I normally wouldn't.  I want  comparison between the Tiny Abom and other trinkets where we already know exactly how good they are.  Here are the "rules" for such testing.<br>
<br>
Level 80 dummy - no debuffs or buffs applied except for JoW if you can find a way to have that available.<br>
WF/FT<br>
Totems dropped - WF/SoE/Mana Spring/Magma<br>
Only one trinket equipped but everything else should be your normal raid kit.<br>
10 minute parses - try to maintain normal priorities for each parse<br>
One series with a <a id="itemlink" class="q4" style=" font-weight: bold;" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100210152130/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=40684" target="_blank">[Mirror of Truth]</a> - you can sell it back after so it won't cost anything<br>
One series with <a id="itemlink" class="q4" style=" font-weight: bold;" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100210152130/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=50351" target="_blank">[Tiny Abomination in a Jar]</a><br>
If possible - one series with <a id="itemlink" class="q4" style=" font-weight: bold;" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100210152130/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=50355" target="_blank">[Herkuml War Token]</a> <br>
Finally one series with no trinkets equipped.<br>
<br>
After you are done with your series load your profile into Rawr and export into EnhSim first with no trinkets and then with Mirror, then with Herkuml and finally with Comet's Trail.  <br>
<br>
Recount will be considered sufficient for this testing - this is just to get people information about the trinket so they can make an informed decision about it's value to know whether to just pass to a rogue or whether to roll/spend DKP on it.<br>
<br>
Reasoning for Mirror of Truth is that it is a known quantity.<br>
<br>
Format for results should take the form of;<br>
<br>
Dummy no trinket - XXXXdps<br>
Dummy with Mirror - XXXXdps<br>
Dummy with Tiny Abom - XXXXdps<br>
Dummy with Herkuml - XXXXdps<br>
Sim no trinkets - XXXXdps<br>
Sim with Mirror - XXXXdps<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I've been working on getting some simulation results for when I get my 2nd piece of tier 10, however I'm not sure what settings to set for Shamanistic Rage and it comes as a ~200 DPS loss going from 4 piece tier 9 to 2 piece tier 10.  So I believe I'm configured part of it wrong.<br>
<br>
Any help or pointing in the right direction would be greatly appreciated, I can edit with my config file if needed.</div>

Dummy with Tiny Abom: 5630<br>
<br>
Using just Tiny Abom recount had me hovering at 5630 dps over the course of 10 minutes.  I had 30 seconds on spirit wolves when I started because the paladin that I recruited had heart of the crusader the first time around without me realizing it.  Did not use bloodlust or Fire Elemental.<br>
<br>
Sim with Tiny Abom: 5591<br>
<br>
I unchecked all of the buffs(including bloodlust) other than 20% haste and the STR/AGI buff.  Ran the simulator at 10 minutes with 0 variance, if that needs to change then it should be an easy fix.<br>

I attached the log from hitting the dummy and the enhsim config because apparently my computer hates the WOL client.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Now that we have some confirmation that the sim model is close to correct:<br>
Keep in mind that Abom in a Jar scales.  As you get more gear it gets better.  With the sim using 264 gear I couldn't get it to be worthwhile, but once I moved up to 277 gear with the 277 Abom suddenly it was BIS.<br>
<br>
However I do agree with you that currently the 264 version should be skipped by all enhancement shamans as it was showing up as one of the worst trinkets for us with currently available gear but is BIS for other classes.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

It seems like it should have so much potential for us and yet is showing so weakly.  That's why I am asking for the comparisons so we can see if we are really getting a full picture of the trinket or if there is something we are missing.<br>
<br>
Maybe we need to come up with a more comprehensive testing procedure so we can not only get these things into the Sim fast but can verify their accuracy.  I'll start up the topic in the EnhSim thread so we can see if we can get a dialogue started on how to do that with some uniformity.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I want to echo this, as I found the same thing. But the effect was less about the trinket scaling (even though it does, and well at that) and more about my BiS setup reaching the crit cap.<br>

What I found while I was building my own BiS set, that I couldn't afford to use WFS, or DBW, or even DC because of the large amounts of crit that gets wasted with these trinkets. Combine that with the fact that TAiaJ adds a lot of additional hit that pushes back the crit cap rather significantly, and it worked out to a BiS item.<br>
<br>
Also, if you're not using TAiaJ, then you should seriously consider gemming hit (even past the cap) for some significant DPS boosts to your theorized BiS kit. The crit cap is a major concern for us in T10 gear (I'm running into it even now in 258 T9 gear), and should be something that every shaman is taking into account. <br>

</div>Useful macro. I'm thinking that adding this feature to ShockAndAwe might be useful. Ie: I'd get ShockAndAwe to add an extra line to the crit tooltip on your paperdoll. With that text or warning about over crit cap. That way users don't need to remember the macro they just mouseover their crit value in game to check.<br>

War Token beats them all by a significant margin.  It even beats all the heroic ones, so it should definitely be occupying one of your trinket slots.  As for the other one, if you have a Comet's Trail or a Whispering Fanged Skull or a Deathbringer's Will then you should still pass on the Tiny Abom but if you don't then it certainly would be worth picking up.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1521940"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Off the topic of trinkets, do we have a concensus on what the highest potential spec is? I have been simming about 12 different variations and each seems to have there niche depending on fight length, how many mobs, and how much movement. Despite my findings I still see some of the lower dps variations pushing out top tier dps on sites such as WMO and WoL. I haven't had a oppurtunity to test these specs in the raiding setting yet, but I was wondering if there is anybody who has? I'm also worried that RNG is a big part of some of the specs results if anybody has an explanation I'd love to hear it.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Still needs to be tested though as there isn't a ton of consistency with the change.  The rets are reporting that they are still getting a possible 3 motes per attack (down from what was 5 before):<br>
1 for the melee attack, 1 for the SoV stack increasing/refreshing, and 1 from the holy damage component of the SoV proc.<br>
<br>
So it's possible we may still get a mote from SS application.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1524837"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->This came up in the BiS thread regarding our rotation list. Basically people were seeing a DPS increase dropping FE in the rotation and someone responded this was due to a ramp up in our AP (and thus SP) giving the FE more damage over its duration if it is casted a few seconds into fight. <br>
<br>
In terms of a "best practices" approach to dropping the totem, what are the buffs we want to have up before using it? Off the top of my head we would wait for;<br>
<br>
20 stacks of war totem<br>
After the first mw5 (with 2t10)<br>
Berserking<br>
Quaking earth or 3 stacks of avalanche<br>
Unleashed rage (should be up regardless)<br>
SoE totem (should be up as well but if you are dropping all 4 totems at once the buff might not apply before SoE)<br>
Any ap trinket procs or on-uses.<br>
<br>
I tried searching Curse but it is hard to search by add-on function. Does anoyne know of an addon that can show current values of stats? I'm thinking a little window in the corner of my screen showing either current AP or SP. Also has there been any research into the FE's scaling coefficients? It seems it's implemented in the sim so there should be some information somewhere but a quick google didn't find anything.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Agreed, 2Pc-T10-SR in conjunction with other additive effects might sway things a bit.  From a purist perspective, EnhSim should answer much of that.  My concern will be how it moves to practice given that SR also serves 2 other functions for us, namely, a mana regen, and in a pinch a damage mitigator.  The beauty of the 4pc T9 is it simply works all the time.  No thought or careful planning required.  To maximize 2pc T10 however could require a bit of planning, and even a little luck(RNGs with trinkets etc).<br>
<br>
As to whether we can trick Enhsim into treating the 2pc T10 similar to a trinket in behavior, I can't answer that from work, but hopefully Levva, Rouncer, or someone with access to EnhSim could possibly fill that in?<br>

		<div id="post_message_1534428"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I'd assume EnhSim models the behavior as the priority queue is configured, which generally has SR as right below Spirt Wovles (Per priority queue in the BiS thread).  Basically, it would just cast it every 1m as soon as it comes off cooldown, regardless of procs, etc., so intelligent application of SR should produce similar results because if you just lost a berserking proc, you could wait a few secs for it to reproc, while enhsim would just cast SR right away.<br>
<br>
For movement based fights, if you're moving to a new target, you obviously would hold off on SR even if it was off cooldown, until you started in on the new target once totems were down, and a proc or two went off already.  If you're lucky enough to be the recipient of a Hysteria, you could coincide SR with that, something EnhSim can't even take into account.<br>
Obviously movement based fights will incur a dps loss that's not the ideal world of enh sim, but judicious use of SR overcomes a lot of that.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1534500"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->With such a short cooldown I think it's likely detrimental to hold off using SR with 2 piece (provided of course that you're actually on the boss for the next 15 seconds. Some don't seem to thrilled by the 2p but I've got to say I love having a bit of on demand boost beyond just wolves. It's great for bursting experiments on Putricide. <br>
<br>
A good rule of thumb I've been going by is if the fight has burst damage sections (like P. Put), delaying it a few seconds while a slime spawns is a good idea, if a fight doesn't (like festergut) use it on cooldown regardless. It has a 25% upptime, waiting for a proc to use it, especially as cramped as we are for globals, doesn't seem right to me. As for heroism, with a 40 second duration, you're more than likely to get a full SR at one point during it. If you're the one controlling the Hero/lust, I'm sure you can manage to fit it in the right window.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Considering our stacking rate, I would say yes but you are welcome to disagree with me and use something else on the fights that require a lot of movement.  Although I would say that it is probably more helpful to have a second set of boots with runspeed for those movement fights then to swap around your trinkets.  Nitro boosts are amazing but the cooldown prevents them from really shining on any fight where the stacking requirements of the token would be considered a negative due to movement.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>Furthermore, based on the ICD of non-stacking trinkets, you may lose a good chunk of a proc in a movement fight. For example, Whispering Fanged Skull likely will proc in the first few seconds of an encounter. You'll get 15 seconds of solid DPS. If the fight then requires you to move to another target, you can hit it for a while while the CD is active and then have it proc again when it's off CD. Unfortunately, the encounter then requires you to switch to another target and run away. In this example, you'll lose a very good chunk of your proc during run time. This can happen repeatedly, making the proc (or procs) on your trinkets become much less valuable.<br>
<br>
I'm not saying it will happen every time, but the sheer possibility of losing an entire proc of one or both of your trinkets is scary. A stacking trinket smooths out dps.<br>
<br>
The only thing I'd really weigh is the value of haste in movement fights. Attack power, with it's benefits to spell power (and thus burst damage), and crit (with higher chances for harder hits and also proc'ing thundering strikes and Elem Dev), may make up for the potential for lost procs on movement fights.<br>
<br>
With that said, I use the War Token no matter what, my personal experiments using WFS and Death's Verdict (Choice) instead on Putricide and the like have not paid off well.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1534709"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Death's Choice/Verdict is really a trinket that should be passed on by shaman to give to another class that can really make use of it.  I'm pretty sure the 258 version is BiS for several of the plate classes while for us it is a significant downgrade from the War Token, WFS, DbW or CT.  We are just too close to the melee crit cap in T9/T10 gear for all the agility from it's proc to really shine.<br>
<br>
I've joined ranks with the haste stackers after spending some time beating on a dummy and playing with the sim the other day trying to get an understanding of why it was showing such high EP values.  I finally understand why it is just so good for us, better then it seems like it should be.  It's not the GCD reduction (although that does help), it's the 30% boost in melee haste effectiveness we got back with the 3.1 patch, a boost that I guess I overlooked when thinking about the stat values.  Hit has steadily been rising in value as we have geared up, even when the crit cap wasn't involved, and that 30% boost means haste is at least 30% more effective then hit past the spell hit cap.<br>
<br>
So if your value for hit rating past the spell hit cap (but under the melee crit cap) is say 1.74 EP then the melee effectiveness of haste is 2.26 before you even bring the GCD reduction aspect of haste into the equation.  <br>
<br>
Stats Rankings should end up looking like this (in order from most to least valuable);<br>
<ul><li>Hit Rating - below special or spell hit cap and if over the melee crit cap but under the melee hit cap (21% hit before talents)<br></li>
<li>Expertise - below the dodge cap, keeping the truncation in mind when evaluating adding any expertise that would take you over that cap.<br></li>
<li>Haste Rating<br></li>
<li>AP<br></li>
<li>ArP ~ Agility ~ Crit Rating<br></li>
<li>Intellect &gt; Spellpower &gt; Strength </li>
</ul><br>

Seems like the trinket will only function properly when you're actually standing right on top of the target... standing at 3 yards from the target, reaching 8 Motes no longer releases the extra hit. <br>

Wow. I just tested and it's true. You actually can be closer than max and it still won't do the damage. On a dummy in IF, I had to get about halfway between max range and the actual dummy model for the manifest anger to actually do it's damage. This is going to be a huge problem for fights like Lanethel where threre's always aoe going on to move out of.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I can confirm this as well. I have tested with both Ironforge and Exodar Training Dummies. When I first looked at this I thought that it was working fine because when you are at max range the stacks still reset when they reach the 8th. But on closer inspection I see that thought the stacks reset the manifest anger does not proc.<br>
<br>
As I continued with my test I moved incrementally closer and it seems like you can't be more than about a yard or perhaps 2 at most away and then the manifest anger will proc. Of course the implications are rather large for a great number of fights.<br>
<br>

Well I guess that does quite seriously change the value of this trinket... And there isn't much we can do about it, apart from bumping the tread that was opened on the official forums <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100208063544/http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=22748956661&amp;sid=1" target="_blank">here</a> and hope for some reaction on the Dev's side. <br>
<br>
Typically this is the sort of issue that Blizzard is usually able to hotfix pretty fast, so we can hopefully see a fix soon.<br>
<br>
Edit: Seems like the bug has been noticed by several other people, I have found posts pointing it out on the Bug Report Forum. This should be something for which we can expect a fix relatively fast, possibly this week with 3.3.2.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I finally understand why it is just so good for us, better then it seems like it should be.  It's not the GCD reduction (although that does help), it's the 30% boost in melee haste effectiveness we got back with the 3.1 patch, a boost that I guess I overlooked when thinking about the stat values.  Hit has steadily been rising in value as we have geared up, even when the crit cap wasn't involved, and that 30% boost means haste is at least 30% more effective then hit past the spell hit cap.<br>
<br>
So if your value for hit rating past the spell hit cap (but under the melee crit cap) is say 1.74 EP then the melee effectiveness of haste is 2.26 before you even bring the GCD reduction aspect of haste into the equation.  <br>
<br>
Stats Rankings should end up looking like this (in order from most to least valuable);<br>
<ul><li>Hit Rating - below special or spell hit cap and if over the melee crit cap but under the melee hit cap (21% hit before talents)<br></li>
<li>Expertise - below the dodge cap, keeping the truncation in mind when evaluating adding any expertise that would take you over that cap.<br></li>
<li>Haste Rating<br></li>
<li>AP<br></li>
<li>ArP ~ Agility ~ Crit Rating<br></li>
<li>Intellect &gt; Spellpower &gt; Strength </li>
</ul><br>
<i>(Edited the last line of the rankings as someone pointed out that spellpower is actually 0.06 EP better then strength.)</i></div>

</div>/sigh I'v been thinking about doing this as well for quite some time again (i've switched to haste gemming in the past) and I expected to see the same ingame results which last time was the same or less dps on most fights. However we ran Togc again tonight and I cannot believe the difference.... 11.3k Anub, 15.3k Twins, 10k Jarraxus, and 8k beasts. This is all about 500-1.5k more than more normal numbers.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

It might be because my gear level is a bit lower than both of yours, thus leading to less white damage and less Haste effectiveness, but I'm trying to figure out if I should just ignore the sim's DPS value and try it out.

EDIT: Strange...I notice it says I have 855 Haste rating, equaling 33.91% Haste on Rawr...but when exporting it to Enhsim it puts down 33.66% Haste. Why might that be happening? Raid buffs don't add anything to the character sheet value.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Levva has been trying to get it to work properly but something must still be glitched.  A workaround is to use Rawr 2.3.5 and update it's item cache and it will export proper data to EnhSim if you are just testing config changes in EnhSim.</span><br>
<br>
edit - just compared the output of 2.3.8 to 2.3.5 to chardev.org (armory is down) and they are within 1/100ths of each other so that workaround is no longer necessary.  <br>

Anyway, looking at your last numbers it looks like haste is beating AP when you take into account the need to stay just below the melee crit cap.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I picked up on this concerning Tiny Abomination in a Jar not releasing the extra hit upon reaching 8 Motes of Anger when standing at max melee range from your target:<br>

<br>
Seems like the trinket will only function properly when you're actually standing right on top of the target... standing at 3 yards from the target, reaching 8 Motes no longer releases the extra hit. <br>
The video attached seems rather conclusive, but I was wondering if anyone who had picked up the trinket could maybe confirm this.<br>
<br>
This could be quite a downer for TAiaJ... I can think of a number of fights where its advantageous to dps from maximum melee range to avoid poison clouds/AoE effects, and having to stand right onto a target in order for a trinket to work would abruptly limit our positioning options. It also raises the question of how this would work out on bosses with large hit-boxes, like Marrowgar.<br>
<br>
Any feed-back on this would most likely be appreciated, I'm not sure how good a trinket can be if it can only function in such a limitative context.</div>
