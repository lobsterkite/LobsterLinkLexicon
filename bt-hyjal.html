		<div id="post_message_403026"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Doing BT through Shade of Akama is pretty much mandatory and you'd be insane not to.  After that, your options diverge, and there really is no "right" answer.  The Hyjal bosses up to Azgalor are objectively easier than Teron, Gurtogg, and certainly Reliquary.  Personally I'd say (Reliquary &gt; Gurtogg &gt; Azgalor &gt; Teron &gt; Anetheron &gt; Kaz'Rogal).  So the trash becomes the determining factor.  Learning the trash waves is half the battle in Hyjal, and it's not very rewarding.  It can be kind of fun though if you look at it like Gothik back in Naxx -- it's really pretty different from other encounters and requires good coordination and communication.  The inevitable process of learning the trash, seeing the boss for the first time, wiping because you didn't quite understand one or two things he did, reclearing the trash, etc., isn't the greatest thing in the world.<br>
<br>
Hyjal is quite rewarding once learned, though.  It's a quicker and surer route to collecting your first Tier 6 pieces than BT, at least.  <br>
<br>
What we did was clear BT up to Reliquary, and then when faced with the choice of wiping to a technically challenging boss and reclearing a gauntlet (albeit a short one) every time, or reclearing trash to learn Hyjal for more/better loot, we opted for the latter.  Two raid sessions in Hyjal has us at Archimonde, and we'll go back for Reliquary once he dies (should be tonight).<br>
<br>
Personally, I'd suggest doing BT through Teron, then if you have tons of healers around work on Gurtogg, and if you don't on a given night, work on Hyjal.  Always best to have options.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_403037"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Obviously you start with Rage Winterchill. From there on I would go Naj'entus, Supremus and Shade of Akama in Black Temple.

Maybe Kaz'rogal as well, but it's advisable to use shadow resistance for him and you might need a another week in Black Temple to get enough Heart of Darkness for that.<br>
<br>
Teron Gorefiend and Gurtogg Bloodboil in Black Temple and Azgalor in Mount Hyjal are pretty equal in difficulty. Different guilds will probably struggle with different fights, depending on what their strengths and weaknesses are.<br>
<br>
Once you get Azgalor down you should start attempting Archimonde. He really isn't that hard, you just need a bit of time to learn how to survive his abilities. He is definately less complex than Reliquary of Souls. From that point on you have only one way to go; Mother Shahraz, Illidari Council and Illidan Stormrage.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Huh, this is the second time I've seen this, and using SR never really occurred to me.  We just wore normal gear, wiped once the first time we saw him because we didn't really know anything about him and we wasted like 40 seconds peeling him off mobs on which he'd aggroed and trying to decide where to position him.  By the time we realized that it's a tightly timed fight, it was too late.  We killed him on the next pull, and again yesterday, with no SR and plenty of time/mana to spare at the end.  I don't think you really need SR gear and I wouldn't worry about doing BT for SR gear before progressing in Hyjal.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Hyjal the first two bosses check you should be there and the next two reinforce that with dps checks; then archimonde gives you freeloot for being able to click on pvp trinkets/major fire pots/slow fall. <br>
We first ventured into Hyjal when the waves took longer than kiting thunderan to orgrimmar so now its seems alot better, in the horde base its certainly more varied.  <br>

		<div id="post_message_403081"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Yeah, never considered using SR at Kaz'Rogal... seemed to be a simple DPS check fight that any guild who should be there should be able to kill him.  Rage/Anetheron are tactical fights, Kaz/Azgalor are DPS checks.  Archimonde reverts back to being a tactical fight.<br>
<br>
One thing to consider about Hyjal is if your guild sucks at learning trash then you probably want to go easy on doing it.  The other thing you'll want to do is carefully make note of what each wave entails, and plan accordingly.  This isn't trash that you just zerg, in particular, the Orc camps have your raid being split at times, doing a variety of things.  It's actually pretty nice once you get the hang of it.<br>
<br>
I feel that Hyjal and BT up to Reliquary really do exist in parallel.  Try both, see which seems better suited for your guild.  Keep in mind you WILL hit a brick wall at Mother Shahraz until you get the requisite SR gear crafted.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_403098"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->We don't use SR on Kaz'Rogal, but we definitely use it on Azgalor. 200 sr on all healers pretty much guarantees you will have 3-4 healers resisting the silence and it helps much considering Azgalor hits like a truck. We wiped 2 hours on him without sr (tank dead during a silence) and killed him in like 3 attempts after crafting bt cloak+legs for every healer. However, we don't have many hots available in our classic lineup (like 1 druid and 1 priest max) so it might explain that. Anyways, fight is so short, mana shouldn't be an issue so it's very worth giving up a bit of healing power for 50% resist silence in my opinion.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I'd say free loot so long as you don't get 2+ failures (people who let more than 1 ghost by) in a row. You can still wipe past the first Shadow, but it just becomes a lot harder. Not really luck based in the sense that it can't be avoided by bringing good people, but luck based in the sense that most average sized raiding guilds will be forced to bring a couple of people with the coordination of a 1 flippered Walrus.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

For Kaz'rogal, I use SR Aura/Karabor Neck/SR Cloak for 165 resist. I've resisted 5 out of 6 mana drains before. Spamming mana pots and keeping JoW on the boss should be enough for almost anyone. One thing we did was use most of the heroisms on the Melee groups, since 40% cast speed increase would just make casting DPS at a higher risk for detonation. High DPS and people who know how to conserve mana is the trick - nobody should blow up unless it's after the enrage (although I did get hit by a Warlock last night.. go figure).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Looks good. Rage and Anetheron should be doable your first night in there (depending on how long you raid I would assume Kazzak 3.0 could be added in there as well).<br>
<br>
HWL -&gt; Shade is also doable in one night depending on how long you raid and read up on things.<br>
<br>
Gorefiend isn't too hard, but requires people to have Bar Mods that play nice (might be the new in combat change and older bar mods). We had quite a few people have to resort to playing with binds only during our first night on him. He seems fairly simple though if you have good healers and aren't unlucky with who he chooses.<br>
<br>
That's where we are at at the moment so I cannot say much after that, but I would assume from reading up on things that everything else falls in order.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

If you can handle the trash well, it really won't take you long to clear 4/5 hyjal, as the bosses are all likely to be killed in no more than a few attempts.

		<div id="post_message_403715"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I'd suggest going Rage -&gt; Anetheron -&gt; Kaz'Rogal -&gt; Azgalor first personally, once you have the trash down the fights are very straightforward and you should be able to kill those four bosses in 2 nights (Rage/Anetheron one night and Kaz/Azgalor the next).  However, as it was previously stated Najentus -&gt; Supremus -&gt; Akama is also about a one night affair, so in 3-4 nights of learning you should be 7 bosses or so deep into T6 content.  Either route is fine, I only suggest going through Hyjal first because once you get at Archimonde he should go down within a few nights of attempts.

</div>Since the mana drain is what makes the fight hard, maybe using shadow resist gear is the way to go. With only 165 I guess you got lucky but with capped mother gear you should resist a lot? Has anyone tested? I'm going to try it next time.<br>
<br>
As for the boss order, focusing on Hyjal has the added benefit that you get to do Archimonde early which is a great fight. Mother is probably the hardest fight of all.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_403959">With ~250 SR on Kaz'rogal ive never had more than 2 drains, and I much prefer slightly lower dps from gear, but 0 (or very near 0) risk of 3 drains in a row. We did this fight with ~250 on all casters and I think all had similar experiences to me (masses of resists, very few drains). Doing it with 0 resist (or just priest buff) and just burning it and trying to get it down before people explode seems way riskier. Full mother gear would probably leave you unlucky to get one drain all fight on kaz'rogal.<br>
<br>
For order I would think <br>
Rage -&gt; Anetheron -&gt; Naj'entus -&gt; Supremus -&gt; Akama -&gt; Kaz'rogal -&gt; Gorefiend -&gt; Az'galor -&gt; Bloodboil -&gt; Archimonde -&gt; RoS -&gt; Mother -&gt; Council -&gt; Illidan<br>
would be the easiest progression route, as alot of the early BT stuff is quite easy, however simply going all out on Hyjal would clearly give you T6 loot and an enboss down much quicker.</div>

</div>I dont see why it woulda been to hard to add rep to the trash in  the last patch <br>
<br>
personally i dont mind hyjal trash now that its 8 waves. It sucks that its a grind with no reward but the bosses have very reasonable learning curves to compensate for the difficulty/lengthyness of the trash, and the trash is more intense so its not like clearing to a boss after wiping until respawns; its almost fun.<br>
I think my guild was discouraged from pushing hyjal progress bc of the trash but once we killed teron and got back into hyjal we realized that it wasnt so bad. Its unlike conventional raid dungeons; you <i>earn</i> the loot rather than proving you are good enough for it.</div>

		<div id="post_message_404293">We killed azgalor the first time we ever saw the boss (transitioning from 'easymode' infernal waves back to the ghoul/abom zerg got 2/3 gungho tanks killed the first few wave attempts), we knew he had a rain of fire and people would get turned into adds, heres how our learning process went:<br>
<br>
So he runs up the center of the camp and our tank goes to meet him, he moves him incase he could cleave thrall, we get our first silence and on vent people just said "ah a silence, does that affect everyone?" we assumed it did with someone stating they resisted the first one ... I guess imp conc aura and some lucky resists help on the silence.<br>
<br>
We went on, some dangerous RoF's on melee later we had one of our feral tanking 2/3 demons and he was around 20% hp, the feral stating the demons weren't hitting that hard but seemed to have some bursty damage.<br>
<br>
We continued to plow through his HP, I used lay on hands after a silence at 15% ish giving the tank the armor buff and we continued on waiting for an 'enrage' etc he died without any suprises leaving us to mop up some adds and assign the loot.<br>
<br>
Certainly for us (Tank has most of the BT random items by now) it was an anticlimactic kill.<br>
<br>
DISCLAIMER: Im really dont want to brag, for us it was a fairly easy ride. I don't recall who got the add debuff - I think we didn't lose any healers till later on or we soulstoned each person. Just curious what people are finding most difficult.</div>

		<div id="post_message_404309">The main issue we were having with the fight was tank damage during the silence. Easy fix- we started doing Intervenes during Silence. Worked well, Main Tank isn't dying.<br>
Second issue was the adds. They spawn, get picked up, damage, etc. (You probably noticed the Thrash when you mentioned burst damage). After about 3 adds I'm spamming max rank Holy Light on the add tank, knowing he may not live through the next silence. We started using two tanks on adds, alternating pickups. Doing this made it so tanks wouldn't die to silence.<br>
<br>
One thing I would reccomend, which we didn't have, is bring two resto druids for Swiftmend after silence ends. Plus, the HoTs during the silence don't hurt.</div>

		<div id="post_message_404341">Patchwerk and Loatheb used to be unable to crush.  I expect it's nothing new.  When Demo fell off I've seen Azgalor melee our tank for 10.5k noncrush, and he has really excellent gear.  If he could crush, it'd be a bit unfair.  At the same time, though, Azgalor attacks very slowly so I'd always just assumed our MT was blocking everything.  But if he can't crush NPCs either, then that makes sense.<br>
<br>
Archimonde definitely can't crush.  Zero recorded crushings over 3+ hours of attempts, even during wipes.  Probably because, again, he can potentially silence the raid and he also can potentially get a +50% damage done effect.  Testing probably showed that crushings could simply result in "unfair" deaths under these circumstances.</div>

</div>The fact that several guilds do use shadow resistance on this fight, with success, proves its a working tactic at least. You could also say that not wearing shadow resistance will prolong the fight, as manausers have to preserve more and some might go oom or die.<br>

Different tactics works for different guilds. I don't think we were anywhere near the enrage; at least I can't recall the fight being especially long. We had about 260 shadow resistance buffed on all mana users. With the BT crafted gear that's just 3-4 slots.</div>

		<div id="post_message_404410">I tried medium SR (like 150ish) on that mana burn boss. It didn't do jack. I resisted like 1 mana burn out of 4-5 or something. In return I gimped myself quite a bit by replacing neck + cloak + bracer. We just used 0 and kicked his sorry ass. Exploding doesn't kill you really. Just make sure you don't hit anyone else and keep on wanding.<br>
For the 4th boss we just off tanked infernals, SSing a few guys that got the debuff. We also kited the boss back and forth so thrall didn't get owned by the rain of fire. At 25% or so a tank that had 1-2 adds got transformed, that kinda sucked (and killed me, even worse!). Still, wasn't so bad. And Thrall was on 60% when the boss died. If you are having HP problems with Thrall, you really need to move the boss more.<br>
If you have SS/CR cooldowns avaible, it's probably much safer to kill the first few adds and get those guys back up again. If you don't have those, I think you need to zerg him. Otherwise your raid runs out of players too fast.</div>

Ended up with 4 doomguards pounding on me (which got decidedly dicy when I was warpstomped+thrash attacks+silence) which was maybe a tad too far.

		<div id="post_message_405145">I can't say much on Kaz'rogal since we killed him on our first pull without any shadow resistance, though we already knew about the mana drain and advised all mana classes to simply spam potions as much as possible (plus spreading), then we pretty much burned him down. It did get a lot tedious in the end but we eventually pulled it off.<br>
<br>
Azgalor on the other hand was pretty annoying, not that much because of the Rain of Fire or silences (we used 2 healing druids and pretty much "drowned" the tank in hots, mana isn't a serious issue at all), but due to the simple fact that Thrall had suicidal tendencies. On our kill, we actually ended up just offtanking the doomguards, using a warrior and a bear (we had about 6 overall I think) and used melee normally on the boss (major/greater fire pots helped a lot). All in all, I believe Blizzard really needs to review the NPC behavior in some of the encounters. Jaina meleeing infernals or Thrall just standing inside Rain of Fire, sometimes leaves you with little choice, since the NPC's aren't even healable. Maybe they nerfed them a bit too much, then again maybe we aren't doing the fights the way they were intended. Time will tell, I guess.</div>

I suppose shadow priests are quite amazing on him, and helps trivialize him?  We had 7 healers 0 shadow priest, and he died, but it was tight.  Healer mana was definitely an issue.

</div>Hehe, it's amazing how you always manage to pull that extra HP out of a hat, Quigon. You're right of course, high HP does trivialize the fight. Quite a few of ours struggle with breaking 10-11k though.</div>

		<div id="post_message_405430">I'm pretty sure if you have 5 shamans in the raid you could kill SoA in about 60 seconds just by offtanking all adds that appear and burning every bloodlust as soon as the channelers release. <br>
<br>
Having done Azgalor again yesterday, we found out that trying to wing it just because it worked last time doesn't really work that well. First wipe to poor healing assignments, second wipe to Thrall dying @ 20% ish, third wipe to my connection dying for about a minute while offtanking 2 adds (warstomp caused them to be a bitch to pick up for the other feral) and then on the kill I managed to get doomed while tanking 2 adds - luckily a soulstone and the feral managing to grab one with prior warning meant they only killed 2 people before they were back under control and we managed to kill him anyway. <br>
<br>
Getting Thrall into the fight at 80% or less is pretty safe - he loses maybe 10% hp every RoF. Obviously if it targets melee a lot (like it did on our second attempt) he can go down pretty fast, but you just have to be aware of it.<br>
<br>
I'd also say Naj'entus is pretty tough for a first boss if you haven't excessively farmed pre-BT. People now starting to enter BT are more likely to have moved through SSC and TK more quickly than other guilds due to the nerfs, so aren't as likely to have quite as much of the higher stam gear from those instances. Having only 9k health is just asking to get gibbed - you really need 12k to be "safe" (shield pop + random spine). Druids and rogues have it easy at least, CoS and Barkskin on 1 minute cooldowns mean you should take less/no damage and makes it a lot easier on healers mana. Warriors should also be going def stance, and everyone should be bandaging if you can't spare the healers - if you're having problems with DPS get people to bandage BEFORE the blast if they aren't topped up, as it means you can break the shield quicker which will stop his regen and give you more DPS time. Frost pots on top of that should make the fight very easy if you want to use them.</div>

</div>May I ask how you manage to accomplish this because it seems we are definitely missing something. We were always under the impression that once engaged, Azgalor puts the entire instance into combat and although we did try to tank him at the base entrance, Thrall would eventually join the fight at will. It's quite possible that doomguards cause him to aggro, since like I stated before, we usually offtank them a bit away from the boss (and the raid) but I can't say for sure.</div>

</div>He's right though. It's time we'd better count stamina as a pve stat. Stamina is not a healing/dps/mitigation stat; but it is indeed a must for every character who wants to tank anything, from watery graves to needle spines, shatter, ww dot, conflag, whatever. Naxxramas days are over, and I really doubt anyone would claim naxxramas was better even in this specific topic.</div>

</div>To add to this, the most effective way to pull is probably MD a tank that's standing near the Tauren, so they get involved early.<br>

Archimonde was proving to be problematic for us last night. Between random disconnects and AFK people, our attempts were lasting 10 seconds to 2 minutes. Every guild that's killed him has (for the most part) had the Doomfire travelling away from the raid, staying in front of Archimonde. We have the fire travelling directly through our melee groups, and there were even a couple times when two fires from either side actually converged behind us to form a ring. Is it just a positioning thing?</div>

		<div id="post_message_405498">12k HP isn't hard for any class to get.  We're talking every group having an imp of course - which on a non dps race like this, you can afford (one group can have a commanding).  Maybe our priests are around 11k?  But with PvP gear and all of that - I see mages pushing it easily on Najentus.  I've told our guild to collect a "stamina set" from day 1, and it has worked very well on a number of fights (more than you might imagine... someone's being gibbed on teron? Increase to 9k HP... they mysteriously never die again).  I remember people bitching about getting 8000 hp for doomwalker back in february... and this fight REQUIRES 8500 minimum HP, so going up another 3k isn't that rough.  I think I've seen green helmets with nearly 1000 HP on them.  <br>
<br>
Really Najentus isn't as healing intense as you might imagine.  This is like sapphiron - add another 1000 hp to sapphiron and it goes from being one of the most intense and crazy fights in Naxx to one of the easiest.  Your ability to have time on decisions, and not lose anyone on the burst change the whole fight - I mean, you can kill kael - If you are having problems on Najentus after killing Kael, you're doing something wrong.  At least for us, the only deaths on Najentus are due to people bursting when you pop the shield.  Just have your tank wear avoidance/efficiency gear and two healers can keep the tank up.  I know my posts sound elitist about this guy, but it just isn't that bad!  <br>
<br>
If you look at so many items from BT and Tier 6 equivalent items - what is the major change?  A small boost to dps, and... 400 hp.  Another item, small boost to dps, another 300 hp.  Stamina is all over black temple - and when you start wearing it, things like poison+root+static charge become much less threatening.  (Apologies for this post if its poorly written, I'm on no sleep).<br>
<br>
Edit: Also I highly recommend that you do not bring more than 5 melee dps to najentus (not counting tank).  This fight has a magic number of max melee dps - and it is 6... but with movement, its really 5.</div>

We just split up melee DPS like hydross (watertombs), one camp directly behind with one to each side (so you end up with a diamond with the tank at one point, and dps on the other three). It's a little harsher on raid healing, but it's perfectly doable if you just have people bandaging/switching to def stance/CloS/barkskin the blast. <br>
<br>
It's certainly not like Bloodboil where bringing anything less than 8 healers and 2 shadowpriests means you're in for a world of pain if you get even a slightly "unlucky" string of fel rages/knockbacks/confusions.</div>

		<div id="post_message_405536">We did same as dukes, 3 melee camps and 1 tank spot, (DPS War, 3 Rogues, 1 Feral, 2 Prot War) which was alot easier than the previous 2 camps and 1 tank spot with an extra meleer in it :P<br>
<br>
Giving almost all the healers the SP's instead of the casters made things alot easier for us esp for our poor Shamans.<br>
<br>
I'ld like to note I didn't die once in any attempt (3) and I had only 8950HP max for the entire fight, perhaps as im a healer myself I focused on my own bar more intently than others, who knows.</div>

		<div id="post_message_405582">You can probably do this fight a dozen ways - I was merely suggesting the one that minimizes damage (And makes the fight "free loot").  I'm sure you could also do this fight with 8501 hp on each person.  I'm sure a paladin could tank it.<br>
<br>
One thing to note, is we get the 2500 damage nuke immediately following him putting his bubble up sometimes.  I'm not sure if this is a bug or not, or bad reporting on srf (I doubt it - I mean we'll have an entire raid topped off, wait for the bubble, watch for 2 seconds, burst, and 3 people die to bubble + nuke) - it means that if you have less than the nuke plus 8500 you might get gibbed (in the 11k range).  It seems to happen only a couple times per fight, but I believe 3 people can die instantly to this.  Again, we've experienced the gamut of bugs in this game, so perhaps we're just the winners of the bug prize.</div>

</div>I can't even fathom 6 healers.. <br>
We had 7 and had to bring in an 8th just to push us over the top, for some reason we fell apart everytime at 10% for like 3 tries in a row, so we just called in an extra healer and bam, it died.<br>
<br>
I salute your healers, perhaps a list of their names so I can build them shrines.</div>

The next night we killed him with 7 healers and 3 Shadowpriests. Complete joke - potted once, didn't even flask.<br>

If it's a real problem and you have a dwarf/draenei priest you could tell your tank to stance dance and keep fear ward on a priest or paladin, who either heals or dispells the rest of the healers during the fear.</div>

</div>It's great. We've ended up getting our MT 200 shadow res (legs/cloak with enchant + buff) to try and cut down on the "luck" of it. We haven't actually been back since crafting it, but it should help a lot (and isn't really gimpy for the rest of the damage as it's only two slots).<br>

Currently having fun with archimonde. Apparently one of our paladins got stealthed up on by a tree (yes, the world tree. Knock in the air -&gt; didn't see the tree, stealth buff? I think so.)</div>

</div>He's not hard, he should definitely die in a few attempts, but he's definitely harder than Shade of Akama and Supremus, who are both complete loot pinatas.  Shade is especially unbelievably easy, probably the same difficulty level as Razorgore.  I assume it was meant to be a gear check but it's not tuned enough for that.<br>
<br>
After downing Teron Gorefiend I have to say he was harder than I expected.  Getting him to 20% is borderline trivial, it's past that where the challenge lies.  We had our fair share of lolpetcontrolishard wipes, but it's also a very gruelling gearcheck on both your dps and your healers, and it requires a very balanced raid.  We had a very large number of sub 10% wipes which would have all been kills with a slightly better-geared raid, but healers run dry and dps starts to fall over.   For this reason, I would recommend the first four bosses of Hyjal before you pursue Gorefiend/Bloodboil, as those bosses will definitely become very significantly easier, the more t6 gear you have.<br>
<br>
edit: as a comical aside, we had Shade go into phase 2 on the pull for us this week, resulting in a 30 second kill.   And you thought he was hard before!</div>

		<div id="post_message_406328">shahraz is one of the most uncontrollable fights they made anyway. being able to resist the fatal attraction is such a joke. it can be 4-5 ported. or it can be 2. then if you don't resist the mana drain a few times in a row, you just want to vomit.<br>
being able to fully resist some of the key abilities can make this fight undoable if extremely unlucky at times and really easy if you get very lucky on resists. encounters like that are just frustrating and shouldn't be designed like that. make the mana burn unresistable. same with fatal attraction. and make it always three people ported.<br>
then the saber lash adds a debuff that makes you immune vs the knock up. that actually exists already. however its horribly coded and doesn't work at times.<br>
just add dmg to saber lash but make it highly mitigateable by armor. and then no knockback in front of her in the saber lash area ever. that way you still need multiple tanks in front of her that would never get knocked up while with increased dmg there's no way you could cheese it with melees in front (which would be rather retarded with parry increasing her swing timer anyway).<br>
<br>
anyway, my point is that the fight sucks atm. and it could be fairly easily made a lot more controllable.<br>

Oh, and I almost forgot about the damage shields. I had much fun as a shadow priest. Just an awesome mechanic.</div>

		<div id="post_message_406489"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->There's a long list of ridiculous design decisions on Sharaz, prime candidate for the nerf bat.<br>
<br>
So hey guys, let's design this resist fight. We're going to have it hit like a truck even though the tank will need to lose some mitigation to wear SR gear. We're going to give it these cool resists to screw with caster DPS, who are doing less damage due to their resist gear anyway. My personal favourite, we're going to add this cool MANA BURN ability, because healers aren't already gimped enough by the SR gear. <br>
<br>
Apart from all that, we're still going to give it 4.5 million HP to drag it out for longer, to make sure the raid has a chance to experience the wonderful RANDOMNESS we put into the encounter. <br>
<br>
We're going to give it this ability that ports players randomly and makes them do damage to each other, starting with second ZERO, because surely everyone must play with zero ping. We're not going to prevent people from being ported on top of the main tank, because a bit of extra damage to him and all the melee is pretty cool stuff, she doesn't quite hit hard enough. And finally, just in case, we're going to add this combination of abilities on independent cooldowns, that will cause the tank to fall over if he fails a resist check that can be failed with 365+ SR.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>That's pretty much what we've ended up with. Either the tank uses noggenfogger/deviates, or we have him stand on the middle of the bear model (using 2 feral offtanks with the MT). If you use bears and have the problem, get the taurens to stand on top of each other, and switch to bear. Note where the hitbox centre is (just behind the front paws) and then stand on top of that. We normally get a saber lash ~5 seconds after she gets to the tank which gives just about enough time for the tanks to position themselves. Even if one misses it, you should be able to survive with just 1 offtank until the second one (sometimes you have to do that because of ports - luckily we've never seen both offtanks get ported together, although I assume it is a remote possibility, yet another luck part of the fight I guess).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Maybe it's just luck, but it never really happened more than once per attempt / kill, if that.

</div>A bit odd that you say Archimonde doesn't hit hard, when he actually hits almost as hard as Shahraz. Even though he doesn't have the same burst potential, things can still go the wrong way pretty fast. Bad fear, Doomfire on the tank, paladin aura / warlock imp outranged and so on. I wouldn't really want to use CoR in this fight (but haven't tried it either).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>We were kind of in the same boat.  What we did was focus on hyjal. We downed the first boss and only got 5 healers, 20 in total attuned to BT.

</div>You'd be wasting your time in BT with 5 healers and only a single shadow priest.  Naj'entus is pretty healing intensive, there's a ton of aoe damage to the raid that can't be avoided and you'll still want at least 2 dedicated to the MT.  With that much aoe, the Hyjal trash shouldn't prove much of a problem and the first few bosses are relative pushovers once you get to them and possibly wipe once just to learn their abilities.  Nothing that requires excessive healing at all.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>We had that problem a couple times. We tried putting a mage plus a druid out pretty far away from the raid, slightly spread to cover gripped people in the air. The druid also took care of ranged people on fire. It seemed decent, but still had the odd death tho.<br>
<br>
What we ended up doing was... standing together. Sounds stupid I know, I thought it was a terrible idea at first. The raid takes more dmg from Air Burst, more people get thrown back from Air Burst so more chance of a "lag" death, and far less dps on Archimonde from ranged as we're knocked back more often. But what ended up happening was:<br>
<br>
MT on Archimonde, rogues behind.<br>
3 ranged dps groups hug a symbol each. Each symbol has a mage on it. Dodge fire as usual, regroup after fears.<br>
MT healers then spread on each of the left/right sides of Archimonde, and a couple raid healers at the back/middle of the raid, also spread.<br>
<br>
So whenever any ranged dps ever got thrown into the air with a Grip on them (or Air'ed then Fear then Grip, far more dangerous) there is always a mage with them to dispel (or trinket/wotf dispel), or if they are a healer and can keep themselves alive till they can get in range or till a mage runs to them.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_408226"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Dunno if this is the right thread for this, but I find this to be hilarious. Here's a tidbit of combat log from one of our first attempts on Azgalor tonight(healing not included):<br>
<br>
24:03.6 Methos's Heroic Strike was parried by Azgalor.<br>
24:03.7 Azgalor hits Methos for 7874 (867 blocked)<br>
24:04.9 Methos's Devastate was dodged by Azgalor.<br>
24:05.2 Methos's Heroic Strike missed Azgalor.<br>
24:06.1 Azgalor hits Methos for 6740 (997 blocked) (1742 absorbed)<br>
24:06.6 Methos's Devastate was parried by Azgalor.<br>
24:07.2 Azgalor attacks. Methos parries.<br>
24:09.5 Azgalor attacks. Methos parries.<br>
24:11.1 Tauren Warrior attacks. Azgalor parries.<br>
24:12.0 Azgalor attacks. Methos parries.<br>
24:12.9 Methos crits Azgalor for 421<br>
24:14.2 Azgalor hits Methos for 7176 (691 blocked)<br>

24:15.9 Horde Grunt's Strike was parried by Azgalor.<br>
24:16.2 Horde Peon attacks. Azgalor parries.<br>
24:16.2 Azgalor hits Methos for 9973<br>
24:17.1 Methos dies. <br>
<br>
Maybe I'm wrong and this isn't parries causing Azgalor to attack so fast, but if it is perhaps they need to take a look at the games parry mechanic? I'd be pissed if it wasn't so funny. Anyone ever had their raid wiped by Horde Peon? We have!<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Kazzak3.0 was pretty trivial (though I guess cleave will call for a quick reposition as Thrall comes in), but Azgalor seems like he is going to be a bit like Anetheron (positioning-wise mainly, but a flip in roles for some classes makes it a bit similar) where positioning will make the fight a lot easier.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Honestly, this progression probably has little to do with positioning, and everything to do with how Hyjal works.  ALL of our Hyjal kills have come on a one shot, the night after our first attempts.<br>
<br>
Why?  Because the zone is mind numbing, it is painful - within 2-3 attempts people are no longer at their prime.  You may learn the entire zone, but soon you aren't fresh and you're mentally drained... even if you don't feel it.  Hyjal is the first zone I can actually say I was tired in - normally shit doesn't bring me down.  <br>
<br>
Combine that with the fact that resting and dwelling on anything (in life or in game) and coming back to it is usually extremely helpful.  <br>
<br>
Being mentally focused is so critical in BT/Hyjal (Kungen: MAX FOCUS?!) - 3-4 hours of no-rep trash will drag anyone but the most devout down.  You can power through it, but its just not the same.  Maybe our guild is full of senior citizens though.  You're dealing with human beings, not robots.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_408276"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Yeah the Horde camp really is a lot more fun than the alliance one.  Our Kaz'rogal strategy is really well defined I think for trash - and makes repeating it all quite nice (other than the occasional instagibs which still bother me).  The movement and open atmosphere really makes it much more enjoyable.  The problem is just doing it for a few hours with nothing to show for it, and only more trash in sight.  You start getting silly mistakes, and a few deaths after 20 minutes of worthless trash and you're wiped.  <br>
<br>
In the alliance camp you basically sit in one spot and do the same shit for 16 waves... on Horde at least the action starts early.  I still think a checkpoint and rep with harder trash/bosses would improve the zone immensely.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Splitting the raid dps for Waves 2+4, tanking the Frost Wyrms so the raid doesn't eat too much damage etc... oh and setting up pulls so we didn't lose Tauren who love to beat face regardless of if it is safe.<br>

Learning the trash was the whole thing for us tonight, was both painful and rewarding as we saw huge improvements with tweaks we made. Azgalor's trash was a bit of a letdown after the Kaz'goral trash we put a bit of thought into, but... meh.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

For us, we put 2 healers and 2 tanks up front in phase 2, and they drag the ghouls into the npcs.

In wave 4 we kill the front mobs as an entire raid then go kill the back mobs.

You cannot really define a strategy and post it somewhere and then expect people to follow it and succeed, it just won't work. Hyjal trash and boss is probably the first encounter design in WoW that requires your raid to think. You have to adept to the waves and you have to get the maximum out of your raid setup. Some setups are melee heavy and it will work. Some are caster heavy and it will work too, just in another way. Hyjal is a challenge, and if you like challenges you will have fun. At least I do.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Yea, sounds solid and unique from what we did tonight.<br>
<br>
We usually had our ranged peel off as Wave 2 was a few secs in (we had leftover mobs from Phase 1 usually) while the melee finish off that plus the few trivial ghouls. We did leave the Trolls on their own at times too due to them not being able to help with boss fights or anything other than those waves.<br>
<br>
One thing we were doing was having a tank, healer and CC sit with the Tauren at their camp to get stuff off of them while the majority of the raid was near Thrall so him and his Shaman could help. Then once stuff was controlled we would sometimes converge.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_408434"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I'm surprised that people are wiping so much on the trash. The most important part of it is not to have tanks doing stupid things (always let the NPC's or totems get initial agro, then pull stuff off while sheeps/shackles are going off), and keep the NPC's alive as much as possible. Abominations are the biggest cause of NPC death - you need 3-4 tanks splitting them up and priests actively shackling abominations that NPC's are attacking to get them to go to a different mob; try and get them on the Abom you're focusing DPS on, or one of the other mobs. <br>
<br>
Having tanks taunting the stuff that is actively attacking NPC's and if theres no-one DPSing their mobs keep them moving them so they can see if an NPC rips easily. One of the other things to do is use Ret aura and Thorns - if you have someone with improved of both it's ~90 damage return per hit, and even without its around 50 if you have both on. As long as you can get initial agro, it isn't so hard to keep fast hitting mobs like Ghouls on you with NPC's pounding on them. <br>
<br>
Having hunters drag individual mobs back to things like the Tauren's/Thrall in the horde camp or the Knights/Jaina in the human camp helps a lot too, as it takes one mob away that is going to get gibbed by a load of NPC's before it can do much as well as bringing more DPS in to the group if you can get them all the way back.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Honestly, this progression probably has little to do with positioning, and everything to do with how Hyjal works.  ALL of our Hyjal kills have come on a one shot, the night after our first attempts.<br>
<br>
Why?  Because the zone is mind numbing, it is painful - within 2-3 attempts people are no longer at their prime.  You may learn the entire zone, but soon you aren't fresh and you're mentally drained... even if you don't feel it.  Hyjal is the first zone I can actually say I was tired in - normally shit doesn't bring me down.  <br>
<br>
Combine that with the fact that resting and dwelling on anything (in life or in game) and coming back to it is usually extremely helpful.  <br>
<br>
Being mentally focused is so critical in BT/Hyjal (Kungen: MAX FOCUS?!) - 3-4 hours of no-rep trash will drag anyone but the most devout down.  You can power through it, but its just not the same.  Maybe our guild is full of senior citizens though.  You're dealing with human beings, not robots.</div>

</div>Granted we've only killed the first boss in hyjal but we had the same experience. We killed kael'thas and were really excited. Hit hyjal only to be brought down by the trash waves. We came up with some decent strategies but people were tired and we just couldn't do it.<br>
<br>
Zone in the next day, everyone's fresh, one shot winterchill with one tank who couldn't stay connected.<br>
<br>
I do enjoy hyjal, but after several rounds of trash people are itching to get to the boss. A lot of people hated general rajaxx from AQ 20 for a reason... but once you had it on farm it was a pretty fun fight. At least the respawn on the NPCs seems like 5 minutes rather than 15. At least blizzard learned something.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

We don't have any trouble keeping the MT up through silence anymore, and we have 4 soulstones, 2 battle rez and 3~4 ankhs, allowing us to get through around 10 dooms without really losing any of our raid members to it.

On a note more related to the current thread topic, the horde camp trash is actually pretty damn fun.

</div>We initially tried this approach as well. Except using Thrall to assist killing doomguards with the melee. However it's my itching intuition that tells me this is an unwise approach to this boss due to the built-in wipe mechanic (doom), but instead would be safer to just burn him full-time with NPC's.<br>
<br>
Is this how most guilds are killing Azgalor? Do you try to control and elongate the fight by killing doomguards? Or do you offtank and ignore them completely while burning the entire fight. If so, how do you keep the NPC's alive other than moving Azgalor completely when RoF hits them. How many dooms are guilds killing him if DPS zerging?<br>
<br>
Also as far as Thrall dieing, the most logical way to keep him alive would be keeping him out of the fight completely... duh, but from what I've seen most guilds ignore that and hope he doesn't get RoF'd again and again. Seems too luck-based to rely on yet it's used often.<br>

</div>I didn't know he enrages either, a few tips that may help you if you want to change up your strategy just a bit. <br>
<br>
Thrall may die quickly in the fire, but that shouldn't mean don't involve him in the fight. We pull azgalor to the tauren area and have "doomed" victims immediately run towards thrall. A tank picks up the demon and thrall helps dps it down, never getting involved in the fight w/ azgalor. Thrall and his buddies can kill the first demon by the time the third is out, without any help from the raid. Because of this we offtank all demons and keep the melee on him (even though it's dangerous with RoF). In addition, people near thrall are out of RoF range and Doom range. We use 1 tank and 1 healer, and then around halfway in we add a second tank and a second healer, MD's can also be helpful as the add tank can be chain stunned in bad cases.<br>
<br>
Hope this helps, a long night on azgalor is not a fun one.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_409459"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->If you decide to burn, the number of adds you'll have really depends on your raid composition. We typically have a ranged/caster heavy raid (2, maybe 3 melee), we burn him down, and we generally have like 6-8 doomguards up when he dies. This is obviously because a lot of our DPS spends the fight silenced.<br>
<br>
Personally I dont think you're meant to kill the adds; you're just prolonging the fight unnecessarily. The mobs are easily tanked with a bit of planning, and you're reducing the chance of things going wrong by beasting him down.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_409474"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->We have killed him a couple of times now and both of our kills were without killing the adds. I think in total we have only ever had 3 or 4 spawn during the fight so it really is not much of an issue. If you are a little slower on DPS just use a couple of tanks to deal with the adds, have them grab alternate doomguards and make sure to soulstone/combat res the doomed people to keep 25 people alive for as long as possible.<br>
<br>
In my opinion prolonging the fight by killing the adds only increases the chance that you will run into danger with Thrall dying. I would much rather tank Azgalor in the middle of the camp and get his silence to aggro as many NPCs as possible then tank him 100yds from Thrall so he is not in the fight. All of the Tauren Warriors and adds around Thrall provide a large DPS boost to the raid.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

This reduces the RoF at Azgalor and means that not only Thrall but also tons of Tauren Warriors and such can survive for a long time.  I think NPCs did 1mil damage total to Azgalor for us.  We also don't use any SR.  With just the priest SR buff someone almost always resists it, plus you have Imp Conc to reduce the duration.  And if everyone gets silenced, a paladin can just bubble out of it if needed.  I don't think we had any close calls on our MT at all really.</div>

</div>That´s kindof the total opposite of how we do it. We have all melee + npc:s on azgalor and someone saying when meleecamp is RoF:ed incase the tank can´t see it. So the boss gets trained around with a constant flow of melee DPS. Thrall isn´t brought in until first doom where the doomed guy get close to Thrall to add him in. Thrall have like 10-20% hp when the fight is over that way. Ranged DPS are on doomguards.<br>
<br>
We don´t use any SR either and we got some paladins with imp conc-aura.<br>
<br>
Edit: On our first and only kill we had the last 3 doomguards offtanked and everyone dps:ing the boss.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Does Azgalor's spell-casting range start at the center of his hit box or at the edge? I remember in early Naxx, Anub'rekhan's impale could actually be outranged fairly easily despite having a 40 yard range because the edge of his hit box was so far from the center of his model, which was the point from where impale range was calculated. I take it Azgalor's RoF is like this too?<br>
<br>
You said you never move Azgalor, so I take it that you just heal the MT through RoF if it's falling on his head?<br>
<br>
edit: Your method would mean the RoF has less possible targets, greatly increasing the chance that it'll fall on the clumped-up melee. Has that given you any problems?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

The upshot is that Azgalor never moves and Thrall is in his back 180.  Once people get in their positions they know that at least Azgalor is going to stay where he's at.

That's the order I'd do them in if learning with knowing how to do them beforehand. Semi-learning while not knowing exactly what's going on is quite painful. Make sure you read up on the hyjal bosses and everyone is paying attention - if you wipe for 3-4 times in a row sometimes it's better calling it and going to a different instance just because once you get to a point on Hyjal trash it isn't worth it any more (lack of concentration/motivation).</div>

</div>I would definitely not put Archimonde that far down the line.  The fight can be horrendously random with the fires and is terribly unforgiving with individual mistakes, but it's not a gear check.  Archimonde loot is equal quality to Illidan and immensely easier to reach right now.  <br>
<br>
Our guild progression has gone like this:<br>
<br>
Winterchill -&gt; Anetheron -&gt; Naj'entus -&gt; Supremeus -&gt; Akama -&gt; Kazrogal -&gt; Azgalor -&gt; Archimonde -&gt; (Finish BT)<br>
<br>
I would support this order, however, if your guild takes more than a few attempts for Anetheron I would suggest pushing Naj-&gt;Akama first.  Don't ever let Naj-&gt;Akama loot rot if you 25 people keyed.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

We've tried basically every strat under the sun, and our best is a 16% wipe due to OT's getting doomed late with no real backup plan (no Thrall or NPCs on DG's). This after a 24% wipe due to Thrall dying to machinegun ROF's on him entirely. <br>
<br>
Getting very sick of this fight, due to how stupid managing Thrall is.

				<div style="font-style:italic">I think Naj'entus -&gt; Teron is much easier than killing Azgalor, but I could be speaking anecdotally as we've had a dickens of a time with Azgalor. We've tried basically every strat under the sun, and our best is a 16% wipe due to OT's getting doomed late with no real backup plan (no Thrall or NPCs on DG's). This after a 24% wipe due to Thrall dying to machinegun ROF's on him entirely. <br>
<br>
Getting very sick of this fight, due to how stupid managing Thrall is. Teron seems to me as a much more controllable and easy encounter, since the only things you have to worry about is maybe consecuitive healers getting Doom'd too early.

</div>We haven't even looked at Teron, so you may be correct.  However, after killing Kazrogal, we felt obligated to at least give Azgalor a few attempts to see where we stood.  Even if you fail, you benefit from the learning experience and can theorycraft afterwards.  We must have gotten lucky because we killed Azgalor on our third attempt, which left Archimonde too tempting to pass on.<br>
<br>
We kept Thrall DPS'ing the doom adds.  It seems like a more logical choice than risking him in the fire.  We used a warrior tank and had a feral druid doing DPS ready for backup.  With battle rezzes and saving soulstones for important people who get doomed, I don't think losing tanks should be a problem unless you get terribly unlucky.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Definitely use it on Kaz'Rogal.  He hits like a girl except for his fixed-damage cleave, and you hopefully have a bunch of NPCs beating on him too, so it helps a lot.<br>
<br>
We use it on Archimonde, too, and tank death has never been a problem.  Archimonde can't crush, so huge spikes aren't that much of a concern.  We always have tremor for the MT healers though.  <br>

		<div id="post_message_415281"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I think Teron is a pretty terrible encounter overall, and probably one of the most frustrating for a lot of guilds. I'd say Azgalor is normally easier than him. Non-Archimonde Hyjal bosses are very basic, and most guilds will go from the '<i>trying to figure out what to do</i>' stage to the '<i>ok we know what to do and now we're trying to get everyone to execute the plan</i>' stage very quickly.<br>
<br>
Our order so far has been: Winterchill &gt; Naj'entus &gt; Supremus &gt; Shade of Akama &gt; Gorefiend &gt; Anetheron &gt; Kaz'rogal &gt; Azgalor &gt; Archimonde &gt; Gurtogg.<br>
<br>
Knowing what I know now, I would probably do it this way if I could go back in time: Winterchill &gt; Naj'entus &gt; Supremus &gt; Shade of Akama &gt; Anetheron &gt; Kaz'rogal &gt; Azgalor &gt; Archimonde &gt; The rest of BT.<br>
<br>
Archimonde is slightly harder than Teron and Gurtogg, but his loot is way better.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Azgalor is just frustrating to me on so many levels due to how stupid the fact that you can't heal or control Thrall in any way. You just watch him die. Hopefully we take him down, then Archimonde soon, so we can focus on Gurtogg and then get the rest of BT.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Teron is an excellent encounter. It's a nice break from some of the other, more stressful encounters in Hyjal and BT. There's a reasonable learning curve to get him down the first time, but once everyone knows what they're doing, each subsequent kill is all about everyone correctly executing a relaxing, entertaining, and very easy minigame.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_415347"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Yeah that's why Teron is frustrating and stupid to me. If the 'right' person gets to be a ghost the encounter can be pretty easy. If the wrong person gets it, you're probably wiping. When we were learning him eventually we just came to the conclusion that a few of our members were going to struggle with controlling/killing their constructs on a consistent basis, probably for the foreseeable future, and we would just keep making attempts until the 'right' people got Shadow of Death.<br>
<br>
Of course the other reason Teron is a terrible encounter is because it basically requires you to wipe 20+ times while everyone gets a turn at having Shadow of Death. Then you get more guaranteed wipes while people take turns fixing pet bar and/or hotkey issues.<br>
<br>
Teron definitely does not fall into the hard category, but it's a stupid and sometimes frustrating encounter. And since I never get the Shadow of Death debuff, to me it's just a dps zerg!<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

We never have enough healers (hopefully changing soon, as per stickied recruitment post), so for us the frustration has been trying to do the fight with 3 paladins, one resto shaman, and 2 holy priests as our only healing, with one person having to focus on dispel duty.

We went into BT and once we had a decent raid comp we downed Naj, Supremus and Shade in one night I believe, those bosses arnt very hard once u learn the gimmicks. After that we struggled a little with Teron, but got him down after 2-3 nights of progression because the server crashed the attempt we probably woulda beat him and people dont know how to control their adds. We havent done Bloodboil yet but from everything I've read he seems pretty hard, we might just end up doing him since the Hjyal trash is a pain in the neck.<br>
<br>
1. Rage Winterchill and 2nd boss if you can stand trash.<br>
2. BT up to Teron<br>
3. Try out bloodboil if you dont think you have the gear for it yet, rough it out in Hyjal.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Definitely use it on Kaz'Rogal.  He hits like a girl except for his fixed-damage cleave, and you hopefully have a bunch of NPCs beating on him too, so it helps a lot.<br>
<br>
We use it on Archimonde, too, and tank death has never been a problem.  Archimonde can't crush, so huge spikes aren't that much of a concern.  We always have tremor for the MT healers though.  <br>
<br>
I think you'd have to be nuts to use it on Azgalor.</div>

</div>Thanks Praetorian.  Do you avoid it on Anetheron due to the risks posed by sleep/carrion swarm on key healers or do you just nuke away with it up?  As I recall you run a bit heavier on the melee than we do (and lighter on the healers if your 6 healer crew on that one Najentus attempt you mentioned is at all representative, lol).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Lol.  I agree with the part about the healers not being able to do this as effectively 100%.  Just out of curiousity have your guildies screenshotted any legendary quotes from you coming out of learning this encounter (I refer of course to the "How Juggernaut Learned Naxx" collection from last fall.</div>

No clue about the rest since I've never used them.  3, 4, and 5 default to Ctrl-3/4/5, but can be rebound to anything.  Have everyone do that, and ignore the pet bar entirely.  I just use F keys.  Mash F4 when I'm about to die, then mash F3 while cycling through targets.  It's fairly foolproof unless people botch it horribly or just don't understand the theory behind the process (and try to burn one down instead of keeping them all snared, or something).</div>

</div>As Praetorian said, basically all you NEED is 3-5, however after the first person gets Deathed, you will always have 2 spirits up. This allows for someone to help the next player with their constructs, and also to shield/debuff Teron.<br>
<br>
The debuff is 1, and the shield is 7 I believe, don't ask me why there are gaps on the pet bar.<br>
<br>
<br>
For Aftermath, we've done:<br>
<br>
Rage -&gt; Anetheron -&gt; Kaz'rogal -&gt; HWL Naj -&gt; Supremus -&gt; Shade -&gt; Teron -&gt; ...<br>
<br>
I'd assume we'd finish Hyjal next.</div>

		<div id="post_message_415513">I have to go with clearing Hyjal somewhere around the time you're on Teron or Bloodboil. Maybe we got lucky or maybe we were just using good strats but we cleared Hyjal like lightning and the loot is absolutely fantastic for the time investment. We went in after getting to Shade of Akama and plowed until Archimonde was dead. One night to kill Anetheron and Kaz'rogal, half a night for Azgolar (we wasted a few hours trying to kite him which really is just not a good strategy, one shotted him when we just planted and burned), and a little under a night for Archimonde who has no trash to clear at all ever.<br>
<br>
The thing about the fights is that they are strategically very simple and almost all based on execution, and for Kaz'rogal and Azgolar that execution is extremely simple. The funny thing is that Anetheron is probably the most complex strategy-wise. Even Archimonde is a simple fight, it's just a fight with lots of things that can kill you and if you die you probably wipe the raid, so it's mainly a retard check type of thing. You need a bit of strategy such that everyone knows how to handle the various situations that arise but it's really just not complicated at all.<br>
<br>
It took us two hours to kill Gorefiend and in retrospect it may have been good to do him first but it doesn't matter really either way. I would recommend clearing Hyjal before Bloodboil because I'm pretty sure all of Hyjal is easier and offers a lot more loot as compensation.</div>

		<div id="post_message_415535">COR is all a judgment call, and nothing else.  It depends on your raid makeup, and the boss at hand (can he kill your tank?).  The gain from it has to be quite large, to risk your tank taking more damage.  If your tank has problems dying in the first place, COR is an awful idea.  If your tank never risks dying at all, why not use COR, especially in Hyjal where NPC damage is a pretty large gain.<br>
<br>
Teron is bad because it requires the entire raid to be prepared and execute.  We went some 12-18? attempts where myself and a rogue never once got the shadow, and by that time we had got him down to 14%, but that doesn't mean you can't perform when you finally do it it, it's *very* simple.  Some people are good at the game, while others are bad.  Some people find strengths in their normal raid job, and cannot perform extra tasks such as kiting mobs or killing ghosts.  Some people can do both flawlessly from the first attempt.  We had a good number of people that killed all their ghosts before they reached halfway across the room the first time they ever got shadow, and we also had people that had got shadow 4-6 (or more) times and still couldn't kill them.<br>
<br>
Hyjal is quite demoralizing at first glance.  However, once trash is learned, and people get a much better idea on how to handle it, it feels like a brand new zone.  Coming back to a boss you killed the prior week, or trash/boss you wiped to sometime prior makes you really question why you haven't killed said boss before.  I read often (and our raid is the same way) of guilds struggling on trash, hardly beating it (or not) before the boss spawns, giving no time for buffs, gear swaps, NPC hp resets and the such.  After a day of rest, the majority feels that said event becomes significantly easier, and everyone performs on a new level.  I hardly expected to kill Azgalor the same night as Kaz, especially with all the horror stories, but his trash is pretty much as easy as Anetheron's with a good strat.  Rage trash took us 1 wipe to figure out, then we were at Rage.  Anetheron took 2 wipes.  Kaz'rogal took some 5-6 and Azgalor took 1.  I feel Kaz trash is much much harder than Azgalor, however the boss is a step up in difficulty.<br>
<br>
It feels like a lot of people take what is said on this board as ultimately the end-all truth.  There are many different opinions, there is no one way to do things.  While the information here is priceless, and often great suggestions, the ones that are best suggested are the ones that tell people to try things out.  Many people have said it before, Hyjal vs BT is very dependent on how your guild/raid plays, and nothing else.  People really do hate trying things before asking how to/what to do nowadays.  My guild is new to voice chat in TBC, so we are still bad about communication, and still many people lack mics.  Hyjal really helps build a much better communicative relationship with the guild/raiding that other zones are not as good at doing.  Everything isn't so cut and dry.  There are underlying gains from things that are never spoken of.  I really hate the ask first mentality.</div>

Rogues own most of the Hyjal bosses that i have experienced so far, so I figured CoR would be a good call on the fights and just wanted to see where others stood on the issue (we have cleared Rage, Anetheron and gottent Kaz to 20% (morons blowing people up and 30 seconds of wasted time as an offtank hung Kaz up away from the raid for the loss)).

Wow, thank you.  I should have thought of this myself but that makes total sense.  We have not had that problem in general but I find that the psychological comfort feeling that an extra 30 seconds of prep time gives really helps some raid members focus better and thus perform better.</div>

</div>What I mean is: A guild with a lot of healers and melee dps will find a much larger benefit out of COR than a guild that has 5 or less melee dps and very few healers.  Granted, any added dps is very nice, but the less of the two class groups you have, the harder it is to justify it.  You will find some guilds use it, when others probably shouldn't.<br>
<br>
I personally find it safe for my raid to use COR on everything except Azgalor, however, we don't  use it on Azgalor, Archimonde, Gurtogg or Teron.</div>

		<div id="post_message_415968">I'd like to share something we discovered - and it might prove very useful to a lot of you guilds.<br>
<br>
The trash before akama can be done with 5 people.  You can farm epics and such all day, easily.  Get rep, get epic gems, get hearts, get some epics at a fairly alarming rate.  Apparently the trash before Teron can be done with 10?<br>
<br>
This is not a learning list, but for farming, i'd go:<br>
Najentus, Supremus, Hyjal, rest of BT.  For farming - that way you can send the crazies in your guild who play all day into BT to farm hearts up.  At this point we basically have 3 SR epics per player from the sheer volume of hearts we've looted, and a ton of nice epics - gems will always be a problem though (just do the math).  <br>

As for difficulty and progression - if you're a relatively solid guild I would recommend doing BT through Bloodboil first, and then Hyjal.  While Hyjal bosses are mostly trivial, the trash will slow many guilds down more than you might imagine; bloodboil will not take you longer than Hydross or Lurker likely did.</div>

		<div id="post_message_416030">Bloodboil was actually fairly easy for us as he's a pretty simple brute-force kind of encounter; we healed through some pretty sub-optimal FR choices and managed to get him down after just over 2 hours of attempts with 23 people (got him down as soon as 2 more healers logged in). I'd recommend taking Bloodboil on before Archimonde if your guild is the type that always has <i>someone</i> who messes up. Archimonde is extremely unforgiving to mistakes, while Bloodboil isn't... as long as someone doesn't end up taking Bloodboil twice. :P<br>

On an unrelated note, anyone got word on how Doomfire works now?</div>

The trash before akama can be done with 5 people.  You can farm epics and such all day, easily.  Get rep, get epic gems, get hearts, get some epics at a fairly alarming rate.  Apparently the trash before Teron can be done with 10?<br>
<br>
This is not a learning list, but for farming, i'd go:<br>
Najentus, Supremus, Hyjal, rest of BT.  For farming - that way you can send the crazies in your guild who play all day into BT to farm hearts up.  At this point we basically have 3 SR epics per player from the sheer volume of hearts we've looted, and a ton of nice epics - gems will always be a problem though (just do the math).  <br>

</div>I guess you did not kill Reliquary yet, did you? The packs leading to mum were made with heart farming in mind. Nothing in there beats aoeing down those non-elites. Can easily be done with 15-20 people as well. I'd focus on killing Reliquary and then spend a few hours farming those packs for hearts (and epics). If you got a few guys willing to solo farm and help out, sure, why not. But overall time per player is much, much better spend on those pre-mum packs. We just extended our raids past midnight, always was 15+ who could stay another hour and farm the stuff a bit longer. Didn't take long until we had enough to craft four pieces for everyone. And you really, really want SR maxxed on at least all non-tanks.<br>
<br>
And I suppose for the five men farming you mean the trash around the Ashtongue NPCs, those packs of 2 rogues or whatever. I don't think any of the big pulls can be 5 manned really. And after Supremus is down, you can teleport to the NPC. Dunno if that is even linked to Supremus, but it should definitely work after killing him.</div>

That makes sense.  I guess I just view Hyjal trash as an integral part of the boss encounters themselves since you can't swap raid makeup like you can before pulling a boss in SSC/TK/BT after the trash is cleared.</div>

</div>You can switch gear before all bosses/trash in BT and hyjal though (and hyjal needs 1 tank for all except Azgalor and Anetheron which need an OT too), except RoS/EoS but that trash only need 1 tank really anyway.

</div>You can.<br>
Have your standby player wait at the entrance ready to zone.<br>
Tell your to-switch player to either HS, enter a portal, log out, w/e to leave the instance.<br>
When its 24 people left inside, standby player zones in.<br>
It can be easily done on 8th wave.. or on break before 7th and 8th.. <br>
We did it today at Kaz'rogal when on person woke up that he needs loots from this boss <br>
<br>
Also while Hyjal trash is perfectly doable with 3 tanks, you might want to have 4, it makes things much easier, and allows you to keep NPCs up. We did Azgalor trash with 1prot+2feral, but its much easier with 2prot+2feral.<br>
We never used more then 2 prot warriors in raid, but well, one reason is that we have only 2 of them in guild, and other that it makes 1 player in raid useless on boss encounter. There can be use for 2nd prot on most, but 3 - not really.</div>

</div>Wow I didn't know it was that much, but for anatheron we brought an extra tank, and for Kaz we brought an extra healer more than we normally bring.<br>
For 4 tanks, 7 healers on each boss... and they went down faster than I've ever seen... with really no deaths other than the mages on one trash wave, but they brew their tea with paint chips and drink it from a sippy cup (I steal my material from edgewalker).<br>
We used 3 tanks, 7 healers for our first few anatherons, and 4 tanks 6 healers for our first few kaz's... I think 4/7 is a much nicer balance; although having done it a few times could also be a huge difference.</div>

		<div id="post_message_417932">We downed Azgalor for the first time last night on our second clear of the trash with Thrall at 2% - fun stuff.  <br>
<br>
I'm curious how people are dealing with the changed Doomfire on Archimonde - we initially positioned him against the mountain as per the guide on bosskillers, but that doesn't seem effective with the way Doomfire moves now.  We tried moving him out into the open and had more success, but weren't able to put in enough time for a kill.  Do people think the half-circle strategy with him against the mountain is still effective, or do you want more room to move with the nwe Doomfire movement?</div>

		<div id="post_message_417946">Not sure what the bosskillers strategy was but putting him against a mountain I'm pretty sure would be a bad thing.  The doomfire afaik didn't snake up the steeper hillsides.  Even though thottbot said it was random, it clearly isn't - and behaved under a few particular rules when it came to turning, collisions, and spawn points.  <br>
<br>
Now we haven't seen it yet in the latest patch, but pre-patch, doomfires could travel away from the raid quite often, as they spawned facing the MT usually (he spawns them basically "on" people in melee range +10 yards).  Some attempts you'd have 4 in the raid though, and even with excellent execution you're probably going to wipe.  Further - if you watch most kill videos, maybe 1 doomfire ever even approaches the raid, and it is no coincidence that these are therefore "kill" videos.  <br>
You could have 5 attempts, and one would be most of the doomfires traveling off into the middle of nowhere.  This attempt would be completely trivial, and the boss would die.<br>
<br>
As it sounds now, there are more doomfires that despawn quicker, increasing the chance of players having to react to the doomfires and dodge them.  <br>
<br>
I suppose you could do a full circle strategy - but you're then going to have other issues with grip.  Again though, this is mostly about what doomfires used to do.<br>
<br>
It is amazing that I enjoy such a ridiculous fight.  Doomfires aren't even the most random part of the fight.  <br>
Random air bursts, random grips, FEAR!!, random doomfires, random parries for 21k bursts at bad times?  Its all pretty much controllable, but if the doomfires want to wipe you, they're going to do it.  I'm also curious if any alliance use a feral druid on him with fear ward.  Seems a rather unfair combination considering he doesn't crush.  The mechanic of fear on this fight ensures that when fear is imminent I cannot, as a MT, be on any global CD - so I just sit there hitting HS/SB and waiting for fear (sometimes for up to 1 full minute).  Yeah its a sad story.</div>

		<div id="post_message_417975">Well, the behavior of Doomfire we experienced (and we never saw the pre-change version outside of videos) was that it followed a player, which means that people definitely have to react to it.  Basically our plan has been for anyone who notices a Doomfire trailing them to run pretty much straight away from the raid to avoid snaking the Doomfire toward other people.  The problem we've had with this on occasion is that person getting Gripped and OOR of decursing, or getting Doomfires on the mountain side of the raid that had to snake all the way around and created a huge barrier on that side.  It seems like maximizing your mobility (like giving an entire side the ability to just rotate if Doomfire spawns near them) is the best option with the current version, but I could certainly be very wrong.<br>
<br>
How does his Well leashing work, btw?  We actually considered trying to tank him with his back to the well so our rogues could just sit in the water and melee him (or right on the bank so they could jump in if they got doomfired) - it seems like using the well to cleanse doomfire is worth it even for casters, since the fight is just about survival, not damage.  Of course, getting your decursers silenced for 30s would likely cause a wipe anyway....</div>

</div>Yes.  That was actually the first thing I did when I got doomfired.  :-P  Seemed like a big body of water positioned near a boss who puts an undispellable fire debuff on you would have to do something.    <br>
<br>
You're silenced while in the water, and for 30 seconds afterward, but it removes Doomfire.</div>

</div>Even if what you're saying about the well cleansing the debuff is true, it doesn't make it any less retarded when a ranged class gets the Doomfire debuff.  Every ranged class has an immense amount of time to prepare and react to the possibility of being feared into one, which is the only real scenario, aside from someone intentionally trailing it onto others.</div>

</div>I really hate to bring up the fear ward discussion, but it is sadly relevant for this fight.  <br>
<br>
If you have it available, wouldn't it be more useful to keep fear ward on a healer and let the warrior use his innate abilities?  In our experience, tank deaths are usually caused by healers being feared out of range.  Even with trinkets and tremor totems, we've still had a few good attempts that we lost due to the tank dying.</div>

</div>I posted the same thing on the R&amp;D earlier. Instant tremor totems is the real benefit of the FW. It also allows those groups to use a real trinket. This is especially important for melee now that doomfires can spawn on them (and often do).</div>

</div>Yeah, we have one fear ward, and it goes on the shaman in our healer group.  Seems like by far the best use of it, and I'd give any more fear wards we had to other shaman to tremor their groups as well.</div>

</div>You can stance switch during a GCD. It's the zerk rage that can't be hit on the GCD. So if you macro fear break you're screwed, but if you manually stance switch to zerker, you can do it 0.5sec after landing a shield slam. <br>

The risk is that a 1.5sec fear cast will prevent you from hitting zerker rage before the fear is cast, but you'll be in the right stance at least, meaning your fear break will come a fraction of a second after being feared at worst.</div>

Archimonde's fear is 1.0sec cast.  Being feared even for a split second is not acceptable for positioning reasons and it can get people killed if a tremor broke their fear immediately.  <br>

</div>Yeah that's probably the biggest thing about it.  Yeah any halfway decent tank can break fears, it's not hard, but TPS goes to hell while waiting.  It's worse on things like Quigon was talking about where you sit there for 30 seconds to a minute while the boss decides he doesn't need to fear.  I have enough fun trying to stay ahead of our fury warrior without having to sit there only HSing for 15 seconds out of a minute.</div>

		<div id="post_message_418489">The doomfire pathing seems to obey the exact same mechanics of a feared player:  It will not path off slopes that cannot be walked up.  This includes simple obstacles like tables, chairs, stumps, etc.  These certain areas turn the doomfire into a glob of fire posing very little threat to the raid.<br>
<br>
During theory crafting I brought up the idea of tanking him across the creek (as fire might not path through water) but we never got a chance to test it.  I'm not clear on his leash range as well so I don't know if this is even possible.  Also, given the analogy to the fear mechanic, I believe you will still go swimming if you are feared on land and close to a body of water. This would destroy the water theory unless another limitation was specifically added to the doomfire spell.<br>
<br>
I didn't experience Archimonde prior to the first doomfire nerf (where it didn't have diminishing damage on the DoT portion) but there seems to be a nagging thought that the Well has a debuff for a reason and would be included in the fight.   <br>
<br>
I hope to get some more information tonight.</div>

</div>That's not true, I do it all the time. Sure he might run off and bounce back for a split second, but there really is no reason to just stand there like a tree. The tank should occasionally adjust his position for Doomfire anyways.<br>
We have also killed him with Doomfire all over the place, surrounding melee, cutting right through the raid, etc (prepatch). Sure it is harder, but still possible.<br>

That happened once, on our first kill actually. You can even see the warrior drop by 12k in the fraps, but he didn't die.<br>
Even in the worst case scenario, I am feared for just half a second at most. He only ever got one hit off, in all our attempts. Considering the huge drop in TPS, it is a (very very small) risk well worth taking. Especially because less TPS means less DPS, resulting in a longer fight which bears other risks.<br>
I see the theoretical danger, but in my experience, nobody actually ever died because of this. Basically, he runs off to a ranged DPSer every time.<br>
Edit: Is this fear even resistable? And I just checked the vid again, said warrior actually just broke fear way early and even hit Archimonde right away.</div>

My theory is that it simply doesn't matter because his fear cast resets the swing timer. In about 5 hours worth of logged attempts, there is always a 2.5 second or longer delay between 'Archimonde begins to cast Fear' and his next auto attack (improved TC is always on). Even in the instance where the other warrior took a hit.<br>
Can any tank who keeps their GCD up to never get feared even for a split second confirm or deny this from their logs?</div>

		<div id="post_message_418592">Why does it matter, 20% bigger hits on an uncrushable mob aren't going to make or break it.  Not stance dancing is gambling if you have a decent dps warrior (which you're going to have unless you're only bringing one).  I've seen him fear at 28 seconds before as well, I've seen him fear me when I was on global, and before I hit berserk stance and he returns to me (I believe it requires 1 more action for him to return), he gibs someone.  I have about 250 ms lag on my actions, leaving about 500-750ms of realistic reaction time on an effective stance dance.  I don't know how many issues have to be pinged back, but you're going to quickly pass the 2.5 second mark if you just shield slammed as he was casting (and if you're ignoring the GC you will attack into the fear by accident so it is definitely more than 1.5 seconds).  I mean practicality here seems to outweigh theorycraft.  <br>
<br>
I mean I'm not trying to stir up shit over one faction having it easier, and saying thats why they killed it - but fear ward is a big deal on this fight, and really should be looked at.<br>
<br>
I still wonder what a joke this fight would be tanking-wise to have a feral druid fear warded on the fight.<br>
<br>
As for doomfire being removed by the water, It might be useful if you tank relatively close to the water for the melee.  <br>

I'm curious when people mention they see it following people - I don't think this was the case before the patch; if it follows people after the patch that is a rather huge mechanic change.  At best it might behave as someone previously describe: its a heat seaker missile, if you dodge it quickly it'll either acquire a new target or go aimlessly forward toward the hills.  <br>
But mostly it just seems to randomly maneuver, without turning too steep, favoring uphill climbs, favoring travel toward open area, and not going up the steepest slopes.  This is why almost invariably he was always aimed toward the east on kill videos.  Trying it both ways you sure get luckier when he's faced east...</div>

</div>In all our tries learning the boss and the kills we've had so far we've never noticed it following anyone, even after this patch. The fire is the same, it can zoom off into the distance doing no damage to anyone, or it can still trap your melee in a nice ring of fire. The only change's I noticed is he spawns them quicker so there are more up, and they despawn abit quicker, and ofcourse now they can spawn behind him. I don't think this makes him harder or easier, he's pretty much the same difficulty, it just makes it a more fun fight.</div>

</div>Don't mean to sound rude, but you need better decursers.  Our first kill was 2druids/2mages.  It affects one person at a time, every 5-10 seconds, and that's a nightmare?  The only real issues are spreading them (decursers) out, and the possibility of a Air Burst+Grip.  Even if that happens though, those affected should be prepared to HS/Pot while they and the decurser meet.<br>
<br>
I was asked to respec resto our first few attempts, and was warned about Grip.  After 15 seconds into the fight, I laughed and asked which of our newer mages had been to Sapphiron.</div>

We had multiple instances in which our MT missed a fear break and it resulted in a dead shadow priest or warlock who were well below the MT on threat.<br>

		<div id="post_message_418815">We did archimonde tonight again with the new doomfires.  Basically the changes are:<br>
<br>
They behave exactly the same for direction choice.<br>
<br>
They spawn more evenly about the boss.<br>
<br>
They despawn faster.<br>
<br>
The space between elements of doomfire is much larger, therefore making the doomfire travel faster.  <br>
<br>
This means that you will have less issues of persistent doomfires in the raid, and less issues of persistent doomfires avoiding the raid.  <br>
<br>
What it means is you're going to have to deal with doomfires in your raid - it is still a terrible crapshoot, but it is more evenly random - if that makes sense.<br>
<br>
Basically, spread out more - what the EJ poster said above is what we came up with.</div>

		<div id="post_message_419117">I would say the new doomfire makes the encounter a lot more difficult. More spreading is a solution for doomfires, but it causes also new problems since healing and decursing is more spread. Getting combos like fear-&gt;Doomfire-&gt;Air burst can be quite devastating especially for nonhealer classes. Also doomfires spawning during fear are causing a lot of problems, it seemed than more often than not somebody got the DoT during fear. Stacking shamans might make a huge difference. <br>

However, our DPS seemed to be much better because melee had a lot easier job avoiding the doomfires than before the patch.</div>

</div>I'm pretty sure on one of our attempts our melee were rapidly surrounded by a doomfire-burning star of David that quickly began to look like a satan star.  I yelled something in vent along the lines of "pray to god melee", and we wiped shortly after.  It was fairly horrific.  <br>
<br>
Archimonde will definitely be one of the hardest bosses to repeat in BT/Hyjal (although Failure mentioned on IRC that Mother Shahraz is even worse in that regard).  But overall these changes to doomfire might actually bring some consistency to the fight as it requires everyone to execute against doomfires, rather than get lucky and avoid seeing them altogether.</div>

		<div id="post_message_419136">Right, a lot of the "omg the melee got destroyed by doomfires, so unfair" is actually a product of someone who was 20 yards away and had a doomfire spawn next to them deciding to cut diagonally towards Archimonde to get away from it, leading it right to the melee.  Then the next one spawns next to the melee, and they have nowhere to go.  I tried to make an analogy of spokes of a wheel with Archimonde being the hub -- that's what the ideal doomfire trail will look like.  If you're cutting across multiple radial lines to escape Doomfire, you're screwing multiple groups because it's cutting right through their positions.  Just run away from him if at all possible.  As more people learn not just how to avoid Doomfire themselves, but how to do so without screwing over everyone around them, it gets easier.<br>
<br>
But still, you'll definitely have situations like a bad Doomfire+Fear causing someone to blow their trinket/racial timer, then 30 seconds later, another bad Doomfire+Fear followed by Air Burst and Grip in midair while they're burning.  Depending on the class that happens to, stuff like that is going to kill you.  And if it causes a Silence Soul Charge, that's probably going to be it right there.</div>

		<div id="post_message_419141">The heat-seeking missile analogy is accurate I think.  It unquestionably can follow players.  If it's not really near anyone, then it'll just wander off in some random direction, which is what a lot of them used to do when they spawned on the side of the raid where no players were standing.  And it won't sharply change directions, like a 180 cutback or something.  But given the number of times I've run, zigging or curving my path, with a Doomfire following perfectly behind me for 5 seconds at a time, sometimes while feared, there's no way it's random.   When it's locked onto someone, they absolutely can control which way it goes.</div>

</div>They're a pretty desperation measure.  Low cast level, so the dispel fails a lot.  It's a gamble.  The safe bet is a health/prot potion to buy you a buffer until a decurser can get you.  Purification, if it works, removes the curse; if it fails, you're probably screwed.</div>

		<div id="post_message_419248">After thinking about it a bit the fight is a lot better now. It went from a fairly static-placement type situation coupled with individuals not being retarded to a more dynamic, adaptive fight (at least from a healer standpoint). This applies to decursing too since people will be 'on-the-go' a lot more due to the new doomfire mechanics. Before, when you got Grip, decursing would be more of a formality unless you were dumb, but now you actively need to look for your decurser early on just in case you got seperated due to doomfire/fear/etc. Lots of healing on people who may be in a tough situation, basically managing doomfire on the raid, since people ARE going to be taking damage. Before, especially with fear break devices (ward, totems, trinket etc.), you would have to be a bit dumb to repeatedly get hit with doomfire. Not a bad fight to end Hyjal, especially given the quick wipe recovery -- some of the random elements can be frustrating, but it's pretty fun.</div>

I'm just wondering if the fire acts differently for guilds who were already spread round him.

</div>Yeah, I have no idea how it works - I was just looking for outs for people getting air bursted out of decurse range and dying to grip.  I assume that just shouldn't happen if decursers are on the ball, but if spellstone did work, it seems like it's worth giving up the wand slot.  <br>
<br>
Health/protection potions/healthstones SEEM like they should be enough, but you'd think a mage could never die to air burst either </div>

</div>I wouldn't say "struggling," but for reference we killed him two weeks ago for the first time, went in last week and killed him quickly (a couple of tries), and then this week it took a little over an hour.  We did have to completely change our positioning, though.<br>
<br>
If you already spread out like that you shouldn't have many problems.  The real change for most guilds has been that for 2/3 of the raid it used to be "if you are anywhere near a Doomfire, you're dumb, stop being dumb" with only melee and a handful of tank healers seriously having to worry about it; now the whole raid is going to need to deal with Doomfire popping up right next to them at various points.</div>

</div>I'm wondering if those DPS victims were above 91% of the warriors threat? That would mean your MT does not have enough threat to overaggro Archimonde's new target while in melee range. This threshold has also been discussed in the Omen thread on this board not too long ago.<br>
<br>
There is definitely no action needed to get him back if you have a healthy threat lead.</div>

The spreading out and breaking FA isn't so much the issue except for really bad port locations (right on top of a camp, right up against a wall so your camera is jacked and you can't see what's going on, into a couch, etc), but mostly I've seen some rough combos on the MT.

</div>A bit OT, but all the warrior has to do is any action that generates aggro. When Maiden used to repentance the MT and run off to kill the paladin I would just use commanding shout. It generates some minimal amount of threat, but enough for the boss to remember you are there and come back after you. Doesn't matter what range the mob is from you as long as you have the most threat and are in combat with the mob.</div>

</div>I said this to the other shamans on Archimonde last night after 4-5 attempts where it was cake for me to avoid. Boy that was a mistake, the next 3 attempts were some of the worst doomfires I have ever seen. Myself and another shaman were totally encircled like the middle of a Venn diagram between two doomfires with doomfire ticking on us leading to the most heart racing intense "oh shit we are so fucked" feeling ever, but somehow we survived. You can deal wit h that. If either of us had been airbursted or gripped without a decurser in range, we would've been seriously screwed.</div>

</div>Stacking your tank with everything you can (like we do - our tank basically just ninjas anything thats an upgrade for him before most corpses hit the ground) and having improved LoH up a lot of the time (50% downwards to save wasting it on high% instalashmidair) helps a hell of a lot on Shahraz. Also getting a minimal amount of shadow res to save him instantly falling over if a FA + 8k sinister (? direct damage anyway) beam happens.<br>
<br>
Our offtanks (me + another feral) use only around 275 shadow res which cuts down on the lash damage loads too (went from ~9k to ~7.5k as I was having to use 2 cloth pieces to cap out SR, and gained 8% dodge too). Offtanks should have enough health to be able to take off a couple of pieces of shadow res if it's gimping them a bit too much.</div>

Comments like yours just make me worry, because it seems at least half our 'attempts' fail because someone feels the damage they took was totally 100% unavoidable and it wasn't their fault (doomfire dot and bursted, or doomfire + burst + curse). I guess you could say the other half is people failing to click their item. &gt;_&lt;</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>Damage can be unavoidable.  Deaths are generally avoidable, up to a point.  You have to build your strat around accounting for, and having an answer for, the relatively likely causes of death.  At some point during the fight, someone is going to get Grip while in midair.  What do you do about that?  At some point in the fight, he's going to fear someone into a Doomfire and then Burst them a couple seconds later.  Again, what do you do about that?<br>
<br>
Those are solvable problems.  Now, once you move away from the realm of "bad events" that are fairly probable during a typical 7-minute kill, into the realm of cruel combinations of bad events, as I mentioned above, yeah, that's going to lead to a death.  But a death isn't necessarily the end of your attempt, unless it coincides with other bad things at the same time.  If you get "unlucky" enough, you will wipe.  I'm convinced of that.  But the truly unavoidable sort of events should only arise in one attempt out of several.  You can play perfectly and still wipe.  But if you play perfectly, you'll get him on the next attempt.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">We're pretty constrained by who we've made SR gear for, but I'm curious -- how many healers do people think is "plenty" for Shahraz?  We've downed her for a few weeks now but it's always pretty brutal, and I despise the fight like no other.<br>
<br>
The spreading out and breaking FA isn't so much the issue except for really bad port locations (right on top of a camp, right up against a wall so your camera is jacked and you can't see what's going on, into a couch, etc), but mostly I've seen some rough combos on the MT.  Some of the non-avoidance streaks are pretty brutal -- I've seen up to three 8.5k+ hits in the span of a single second and 4 similar hits in the span of two seconds as well.  More often than not the tank just seems to fall over, especially if a healer or two of his has just been ported/thrown or if the raid's recovering from a bad port.  Really, really frustrating.<br>
<br>
But hey, at least she's easy to leash, I suppose.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>After the first discussion about SR on the MT in this fight, I actually tried 300 SR instead of 200 and it seemed a bit more stable to the healers. I think this is mostly because last time I tried with higher SR, there were 1 or 2 greens in the mix, which really does hurt your physical mitigation.<br>
8.5k hits still doesnt sound right. Was demo shout on, was your tank using Ironshields and did he have devotion aura (a single pally can get ported)? Also, are your offtanks hitting her? The multiple hit combos in 1-2 seconds are always a result of parries. Our offtanks just hit her once in the beginning and then just stand there spamming debuffs (or in case of druids just idle).</div>

</div>The one person we're missing from our Kael'thas raid is a Rogue, who somehow lost the quest and his Vashj vial without realizing.<br>
<br>
For Black Temple, we're missing said Rogue, one Feral Druid that forgot to wear his suit for Al'ar, one Paladin that forgot to turn in the Al'ar quest before Rage Winterchill and one Paladin who's actually an alt and, somewhat understandably, hadn't fulfilled the prerequisite requirements to take Seer Olum's quest after last Fathom-Lord Karathress.<br>
<br>
I guess for arguements sake we could have our other Feral Druid respec and maybe even our token Enhancement Shaman but, I don't know, it seems like a real stretch to try. I'm desperate to get into Black Temple but not to the point where it'd be a demoralizingly colossal waste of time and money. I'm just looking to cover every base before tomorrow.<br>
<br>
We'll likely try Anetheron tomorrow once we've finished up in SSC. We did one attempt at it's trash and wiped on the seventh wave which, considering we're only twenty-four to start with and had one Warlock chain disconnecting, doesn't seem too bad considering how bad we were at getting the whole AoE thing down. Our raid make up is very solid for Hyjal at least (four tanks, seven healers, three Paladins and four Shamans)</div>

		<div id="post_message_420514">High Warlord Najentus is a relatively healing intensive fight, and less people means that his random target damage will be spread out among less people to begin with, making things worse on that front.  We use 7 healers for him and it's tight, but heavy use of major frost protection potions could easily make him more doable with less. (Our first kill actually came on the first attempt after people ran out of frost pots)<br>
<br>
Supremus on the other hand could quite easily be done with 5 healers if your raid is good at kiting him and not /dancing in the volcanoes.  He feels very similar to Heigan where you could easily do him with 15 highly competent people.  Sadly, he has an enrage timer (a relatively long one though) that makes that somewhat difficult in practice.<br>
<br>
For Hyjal, we generally do Anetheron with 6 healers and it's really not that bad.  Once the DPS has everything worked out, you can easily kill him by the third infernal or before the fourth depending on when/if you begin to just off-tank them.</div>

</div>Not that this would be as fulfilling as killing a boss, but you could very reasonably farm BT trash with 21 people. That'd be getting people rep, gems, and random drops - all things that will help BG as a whole, plus a change from stuff you've been seeing. More practically though, probably need to just slog through another week of SSC/TK to get more people attuned, because once you have a full raid plus a few replacements MH/BT attuned, dropping the tier 5 instances in favor of t6 raid time is a pretty good idea. For us at least, since we only raid 4 nights a week, doing SSC/TK means we're pretty much out half of our sessions for new stuff.</div>

Had we had the option of going to Hyjal as it is now, I'm sure that would've been much easier progression, especially if you get an extra 3 people for those raids.</div>

</div>Pretty simple solution if you think about it -_-.  24/25 vs 21/25.  We've done all of Hyjal save Archimonde with no shadow priest, 1 shaman and less than 25.  Granted, BT is *very* rewarding once you start killing in there, but if you simply insist on doing tier6 content, why not set yourself up for the most success possible.  Shadow priests were simply made for Naj'entus.  Our first couple kills had none, and our latest kill had one; man the difference.</div>

		<div id="post_message_420983">Simple question, probably not deserving of its own thread.<br>
<br>
Am I missing something, or when Blizzard devs sat down to design Mother Shahraz, was the thought process something like "Hmm, this boss seems to be missing a certain something, just that special x-factor.  Oh hey, I've got it!  Let's make it fuck caster DPS!"<br>
<br>
If I'm missing something, feel free to tell me that I'm dumb and need to think more, but looking at other kills I'm pretty sure I'm not missing anything.  We spent the weekend farming Hearts and should be taking our first real shots at her tomorrow, but we did a bunch of practice pulls in between farming runs to see all the mechanics firsthand, and is there really any point to the whole Prismatic Shield thing?  I mean I think I know how to control it, and how to coordinate to minimize its effects, but even with the best handling, it horribly gimps your caster DPS on a fight where they're already swapping out a lot of gear for SR.  And it makes it almost impossible for me to justify bringing, say, an elemental shaman to this fight.  I mean even a moonkin could moonfire between nature cycles.<br>

</div>Ehh, sort of.  For most immune bosses you can have people respec, and just bring your ordinary raid with mages as arcane instead of fire, or whatever.  <br>
<br>
The current mechanics would make more sense if there were some sort of vuln component to offset the damage reductions (like if fire damage increased her susceptibility to frost, or vice versa), or if her HP were lowered and she also had some kind of melee hinderance like a periodic damage shield, so that all classes faced similar sorts of obstacles.<br>
<br>
Right now it's basically just "casters do 500 DPS, melee 1000" with no real explanation or elegance beyond that.  <br>
<br>
Looking on lossendil you just see one 400 DPS caster after another, and stacked raids.</div>

		<div id="post_message_421010">I think Prismatic Shild has something to do with the nature of her beams: "Strikes an enemy with shadow energy that arcs to another nearby enemy. The spell affects up to 10 targets." Without Prismatic Shild and with only ranged DPS the raidgroup could spread out like in the C'Thun encounter and would suffer minimal damage. A clear advantage from ranged DPS over melee DPS. But with Prismatic Shild you are forced to bring some melee DPS. Melee DPS take a lot of damage because one beam upon a melee will arc to all melee players. At the bottom line you and get:<br>
<br>
melee: high damage output but also take much damage<br>
ranged: low damage output and take few damage<br>
<br>
In my opinion Prismatic Shild is a balance mechanism.</div>

		<div id="post_message_421017">But the beams aren't really very dangerous with SR, and also bounce over greater distances than the usual abilities that bounce, so if you tried to just spread loosely around her you'd see lots of chains.

<br>
Looking at the top DPS public WWS, from Blood Legion:  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070918214136/http://www.lossendil.com/wws/?report=jozi4l3hwai1c&amp;s=15849-16242&amp;m" target="_blank">Wow Web Stats</a><br>
They had two rogues that were #1 and #2 on DMs with 1216 and 1176 sustained, respectively, and #21 and #25 on damage taken.<br>
<br>
Compare that to the warlock who had 99% DPS uptime, lived the whole fight, and did 476 DPS and was #9 on damage taken.<br>
<br>
Melee really don't have a harder time on this fight in any way, and certainly not to the extent that would justify having to gimp caster DPS to justify bringing melee.</div>

One caster doing more DPS than the tank. One. We only had 6 in the first place (of which the 2 mages died very early and we didn't bother ressing them for obvious reasons). <br>
<br>
Casters get screwed over horribly over the whole fight - no SoL for extra healing, no CloS to stop damage incoming from FA (doesn't break the beam, just stops damage same as iceblock/bubble) and no intervene/sprint to help break it.<br>
<br>
I couldn't imagine doing Shahraz with 1 hunter, 2 warriors and 2 rogues (our "normal" setup). It would take 2-3 minutes longer and there's too much luck involved in beams/FA. We had 2 wipeouts at ~8% and ~30% last night before the kill, one to a FA on top of the raid (we use a 1 group system) and one to attrition from FA/Beams and the MT dying because of it. If our casters weren't so horribly gimped by Prismatic Shield (as if they aren't screwed already because of shadow res gear/wicked beam anyway) then I wouldn't doubt either as having been a kill.</div>

</div>It's funny how that exact comment seems to come up over and over with respect to many fights in the expansion. People said it about pre-2.1 Vashj and her mind control, Solarian has so many design issues it's not funny, Archimonde has some really frustrating interactions between his abilities, and now Mother. I'd add Azgalor's Rain of Fire killing Thrall (who can't be healed or pulled off the boss) to that list, but that's a side effect from the nerf they gave him (although clearly wiping over and over because of NPC death wasn't the intended effect of that change). Even something small and silly, like Prince throwing axes before his last enfeeble wears off, is clearly unintended.</div>

		<div id="post_message_421512">I think while Mother Shahraz is definitely not the most fun fight, it's tuned pretty well for what I think it's supposed to be.  It's kind of like a super gear check on top of the organization check.<br>
<br>
Personally I would be glad to see some of the really terrible porting locations removed (Hrm, 3 people just got ported inside a couch and died, great!) and I'd like to see the fact that the ports/knockback can make saber lash a gib (off tanks ported or MT knocked in the air)  Those are the biggest complaints I have with the fight.  I can also say I think that the reduction to caster damage is a bit severe, I've never seen myself on damage meters as a tank before except once in my old guild on a very sketchy firemaw kill.  The idea behind the mechanic is kind of interesting, and it does make people adapt, but in functionality casters get fucked.<br>
<br>
We had some comments last night that we fully expected patch notes saying that her Fatal Attraction would become more predictable and have it be nerfed to hell.  Personally I hope it isn't that bad, but there are some port locations that are just really stupid and if you get 2 MT healers ported into a couch at the start of the fight, you're probably going to wipe.<br>
<br>
<br>
edit: as a side note, somehow I don't find this fight to be too bad, but maybe that's because as the tank it's pretty much one of the 2 fights that I usually have full rage at all times for (Archimonde being the other) so I just get to go nuts.  Though I get angry when I run out because she doesn't hit me for 20 seconds.  My biggest annoyance is that between learning her and getting her down a second time, I used probably over 70 ironshield potions.  Between the 2 days we killed her the total was 66 and I think that I used a few on attempts we were checking her out.</div>

</div>OTs can't get ported unless they dodge/parry multiple Lashes in a row -- you can actively turn your back if that happens to make sure the 30sec debuff stays on you.  <br>
<br>
Anyway, as I said above, we haven't actually pulled Shahraz with a proper raid group (a farming group with 5 healers and only 2/3 of the raid with SR gear doesn't count) so I reserve further comments until after tonight.  My main initial gripe was just with Prismatic Shield, because as a raid leader it pretty much sucks having to deviate so much from any semblance of our ordinary raid composition.  I mean I can understand "shamans are really good on Archimonde, let's bring more" where you're basically talking like 2 raid slots changing, or "melee is great on RoS, let's make sure we bring enough rogues," and a mechanic that makes all caster DPS, regardless of class, nearly useless.  Warlock curses can't even justify their spot over another hunter or something, because CoR on Shahraz seems like a less than good idea, and CoS/CoE are modifying damage that is pathetic to begin with, which makes them pretty marginal.</div>

</div>This is truly a fun dps race when it comes down to it.  Racing Azzy's health bar with Thrall's is pretty fun.  We of course learned this the hard way with our original stat, but we got our first kill on him yesterday with ease when we switched over to a dps zerging.  I wish I had the honor of dying to Doom instead of Rain of Fire, but when your group healer gets silenced with cos and fire pot timers down, it's geegee.<br>

</div>This is a bit of a de-rail, but did you regularly painlessly clear through all of the Naxx content that you had on farm week-in week-out?  I know we didn't, but maybe we just sucked at the time.<br>
<br>
Naxx was never a quick, efficient loot-spree.   Maybe if you had the exact same 40 people every week that stayed focused the entire time, but for us at least it was never a guaranteed one-shot on fights like Patchwerk, Thaddius, Gluth, Gothik, or 4 horsemen.   Don't have your 8 warriors online?  Guess you're not doing 4h until tomorrow.   Thaddius with 12 healers?  Didn't think so.   <br>
<br>
Learning KT and Sapphiron was quite frustrating because it basically required that you showed true class on the 4-wings of clearing up to them.   Our best ever performance in the zone was being clear up to KT by Thursday night, but with dodgy Friday and weekend attendance that didn't do us all that much good.<br>
<br>
I think BT is a much better example so far;  blowing through the first 5-6 bosses in a night and having the rest of the week to work on RoS or Shahraz isn't only possible but it's completely feasible and done by everyone that's in BT in the first place.   Maybe that's because BT is just easier in general, but personally I think that's the model Blizzard needs to aim for.   Interesting, quick trash, interesting but not overly tuned bosses (in my experience so far, no comments about Mother Sharaz).</div>

By the by, for guilds learning the trash -- please do make sure the random people who die on waves run back on their own.  That can be extremely helpful, you may not always get time to get out of combat for the next wave.  Use your timers aggressively if you fall behind too.</div>

</div>We cleared Naxx pretty late (Mid November), but from my past experiences, once we've killed KT, everything prior to Sapphion was automatic, even with a few new players in the raid. We'd have the occasional wipe or two, due to a freak accident. After refining Sapphiron and Kel'thuzad strategy on the following few kills, Naxxramas was at most a 10 hour clear.<br>
<br>
As for now, Hyjal is hardly automatic for my guild. Azgalor gives us a few problems and Archimonde takes a few tries as well. Once guilds master the instance, I'm sure it'll be a two hour clear. The effort/time vs reward ratio for Hyjal is DEFINITELY worth having to focus hard on trash, and if you look at it that way, the trash really isn't that bad, especially after they add loot/rep. TBH, hardcore guilds should be giving 110% on trash anyway, since trash-clearing takes up the majority of farm nights.</div>

		<div id="post_message_421630">Ehh, even viewing trash as part of the "boss event" I still think Hyjal is a terribly designed shithole.  I think many of the posters on this board have seen a "trash as part of the boss event" that was done right.  Kel'thuzad was the perfect example, it set the tone, gave a dps check, and took a total of maybe 5 minutes, not 25.  It wasn't fun if someone screwed up and you wiped, but you didn't have to reclear 25 minutes of the same bullshit for one try.<br>
<br>
Rep is only a good tool if you constantly want more rep.  In Hyjal, I'd like to get the exalted ring, so that's okay, but what about after that, maybe some people will be sitting at exalted but still want the t6 helm, and it'll still blow to do all that trash.  For an example, so many people liked BT trash because they wanted the end result of the rep.  For someone who had 0 interest in any of the rep rewards, it still wasn't fun, and everytime we decided "let's pull that extra pack for rep" I sure wasn't interested.<br>
<br>
For what Jager commented, yeah, I'm sure a lot of guilds didn't painlessly clear Naxx, I know we definitely wiped on Gothik more than was necessary.  But really, the real difference I see is with the fact that TBC lets you have multiple smaller dungeons instead of one huge one, so you can decide to not do Hyjal on a week you want learning time in BT, or not do TK, whereas Naxx was like having to clear Hyjal and Tempest Keep each week before going to BT.  It just takes time and sometimes you'd get annoyed because you couldn't work on something new.</div>

</div>Exactly. <br>
<br>
But that's really just a problem with WoW's reputation system in general, not the rewards given for killing trash. The current incarnation of raid trash giving rep (oh wait, except SSC/TK/Hyjal don't give rep), epics, and Marks of the Illidari is about as good as it will get. Even then, rep still isn't a satisfactory system because you can't use it as currency.</div>

</div>So, Rajaxx's trash was harder than rajaxx himself. It's 4 bosses that are tuned differently than the dozens of bosses that came before them. Is it that big of a deal? <br>
<br>
Except for winterchill, I don't think any of the hyjal bosses are that easy.<br>
<br>
Do I want blizzard to use this design frequently in the future? not necessarily, but they shook things up and went with something different. I enjoy it and it's a nice change of pace. You aren't gonna please everyone. <br>
<br>
The suppression room to Broodlord is harder than broodlord so it's not like this type of design is unprecedented. Blizzard just took it to the extreme in Hyjal and has tuned it pretty well to make it fun. But it's my opinion and I'm just throwing it out there. A lot of people in my guild enjoy the intensity of the trash followed by a reasonably challenging boss.</div>

</div>I kind of agree, the trash is decently balanced right now, maybe 1-2 less add each pack or something to make it a little easier on the raid but its fun.<br>
<br>
My favorite part of hyjal is actually falling behind a wave, not getting to drink and still pulling through, once we were on one of the later waves of the second boss in the orc camp (wish I could remember his name) and we fell behind and we kept going, eventually got overwhelmed at the end, but it was definately the most fun I have had in WoW in ages.</div>

		<div id="post_message_421707">A couple of comments on the trash design for Hyjal: <br>
<br>
First, as several people have said, it's a refreshing change. Second, once they add rep to the trash, it will help ease the most painful part, which is wiping and having to reclear. Once you've got the bosses on farm and people have gotten their upgraded rings and everything, you won't need the rep, but you also shouldn't be clearing the trash more than once per boss. And the bosses are quick once you have them down, way faster than any traditional instance. Lastly, I'm pretty sure they are going to rebuff Jaina and Thrall in a content patch, since the HP/damage nerf was just a temporary fix to prevent them from being too strong on the bosses, so once they are stronger, the trash will be relatively easier.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Hyjal trash will actually be pretty fun once they add rep and loot to it. I already enjoy it the first time around (any more than that and it becomes tedious) and once they add rep so I can get that much closer to the revered jewels, it'll be a breeze.</div>

</div>The first thing I thought of when they announced trash drops in hyjal is that it will be difficult to do loot when you have to worry about the next trash wave. If you do loot council, that's gonna be very hard to decide loot during the trash. you pretty much have to predetermine who it's gonna go to if it drops.<br>
<br>
Also, there could be range issues, especially in the horde camp. For example, a warlock is in the gargoyle are in the back but a caster neck item drops from one of the ghouls in the melee camp. Will they be too far away to receive the item? Also, usually the melee aren't in combat with the gargoyles normally.<br>
<br>
The orc camp is bigger than solarian's room and I know people have been out of range to get credit for loot when they are afk on the other side of the room</div>

		<div id="post_message_421728">I still disagree that Hyjal will be any more fun just from adding loot and rep to trash.  Right now the only reason I care about rep is the ring because I haven't found 2 rings that are better than it.  If I had 2 rings that were better than that, I wouldn't want rep.  Trash drops usually are okay, but given now at the point that they'll be getting drops in, most of my gear will be solid, why am I going to be interested in loot.  It's like when the off hand mace drops in BT, nobody cares cause everyone has it or better, it will just be the same thing, but at the end of the day, add on the fact that if your tank disconnects you now have to reclear it for 25 minutes.<br>
<br>
That's the big thing, is that it takes so long to do.  Suppression room took a few minutes, it's not that broodlord was such a great fight and the trash was a joke that made that better than Hyjal, it's that it didn't take a minimum of 25 minutes to clear it each attempt.  (And for those who remembered, people HATED the suppression room)<br>
<br>
The trash itself isn't a problem, trash being a challenge and requiring you to pay attention isn't a problem.  Having one key person disconnect, or having a new member screw something up leading to a full 25 minute reclear is the problem, and rep/drops isn't going to change that.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">It's best to just view the trash as part of the boss event.  The "boss" itself isn't too hard once you get there.  I actually don't mind it much.  The 2.2 rep changes should help in that regard as well.</div>

</div>I'm kinda a bit worried about this 'trash can drop loot' stuff. Especially if they will also drop grey. I am having this nightmare of a thousand blinking, non despawning corpses. Also master loot is probably mandatory so people do not start looting mid fight and get all excited about shiny purples popping up.<br>
<br>
The trash waves are fine with me. It's kinda the same sort of time sink the Heigan gauntlet and the two hulks at Thaddius represented. If people are awake and don't fuck around, it's not a problem at all. Cutting two more of the waves would be good though, it does take a bit too long. Removing 2-3 of the easy waves would make things smoother.</div>

		<div id="post_message_421871">I have to admit, trash would be a little more fun per boss if it wasn't the same mobs over and over again with mixed wave flavors of the same trash you had waves before.  Maybe even add in some objectives, like defending a tower or something a little more interactive with the environment other than clearing 8 waves of grab bag trash.  Don't get me wrong though, I really do enjoy the zone, even though some might consider the trash clear itself sadistic.</div>

</div>I think we've pretty much mastered keeping all of the NPC's alive at this point, and even in the worst case staff in the death and decay and melee infernal scenarios they always seem to pull 1 million+ damage. Our last Anetheron kill was with every NPC up and I believe he was on the 4th Infernal Spawn when he died, with NPC's doing close to 2,000,000 solely on him.<br>

Mages can get around the prismatic shield by speccing arcane/fire, warlocks by speccing destro with fire talents, or felguard which is even better, since felguard isn't "wearing" shadow resist.  Lining up schools isn't hard, Fire+Frost / Arcane+Shadow covers all your bases.  Shadow priests are the true black sheep of this encounter.  Staying out of Shadow form and casting smite during shadow shield is just silly, so they spend most of the encounter sitting around doing nothing, and in the mean time refunding very little mana their group in what is already a very mana intensive fight.<br>
<br>
Honestly it's about time melee had a big advantage on a fight, although the complete lack of any real penalties for stacking melee dps makes it feel a little bit like pre nerf ragnaros.</div>

		<div id="post_message_422473" class="post_message_underline">Returning to Shahraz, what sort of learning curve has been the norm with her for guilds that have killed her, and how repeatable have the kills been after the first?  As noted above, we had our first night on her yesterday, and it's a tricky fight to troubleshoot in terms of strat refinement.  We had a 1% wipe that was pretty much completely clean at 10%, shield wall wore off at 4-5%, and precisely at that moment she ported 3 melee on top of our MT, who exploded before we could blink, and then she killed the rest of us before we killed her.  Heartbreaking, but my typical take on 1% wipes is that if you deserve the kill you should be able to turn around and do it again; we clearly didn't, since I don't think we got below 30%ish after that.  <br>
<br>
But it's tough, looking back, to figure out what needs to change.  Most FA ports were nonfatal, with the exceptions being really bad locations (oh hey we're inside a tree), or the same person being ported 2x-3x in a row and having no timers at all left to use in response, with the occasional outright fuckup.  Wipes would be due to the MT getting gibbed more often than not, but comparing our WWS to others, our MT was taking less damage overall than the tanks on many successful kills, and the deaths almost always were not attributable to healer error (either OOM late in the fight due to Wicked spam, or something like 3 healers getting FA-ported at the same time as 3 other healers get punted in the air by Sinister, or just an unreasonable spike doing 22k+ in &lt;1.5sec).  With probably every other fight it's been easy to identify where exactly we were going wrong, what element of our strat was flawed, or where our execution was lacking.  I wonder, what was it that "clicked" for people, to turn repeated wipes into a kill?</div>

		<div id="post_message_422493" class="post_message_underline" style="min-height: 183px;">Well as I think I mentioned, it doesn't usually end up being a problem.  Most times like Dukes said, something will get CC'd, it's usually when we don't get a reset before the next wave (which means dps was slow) and it is just a frustration while the wave is being controlled and casters are being handled.  Just one of my personal gripes about Hyjal is that when none of the NPC's assist, the tanks job is about 20 times harder than when they decide they do want to assist.  (As a side note, I've seen a time where all of our shackles are up and every un CC'd mob is getting attacked by at least one NPC, it's never wiped us, but it just makes me hate Hyjal even more)<br>
<br>
As for Shahraz, is it just mostly tank deaths that's causing the wipes Gurgthock?  I've been curious myself to hear what other guilds saw for wipe causes in learning the fight.  If you're saying random raid deaths are mostly not an issue (yeah getting ported into a couch is so annoying) then I'd say you're most of the way there, our second kill was mostly delayed by people forgetting how to handle FA, and a few times where she decided that I needed to die and there wasn't anything we could do about it (and that one time when people decided I didn't need healing because I avoided every attack for ~15 seconds then died)  The tank instagib seems to happen sometimes, but it's not very often if you're doing everything you can to minimize the damage they're taking and maximize their survivability (at least in my experience)</div>

		<div id="post_message_422511" class="post_message_underline">It's hard to understand the repeatability of a Shahraz tactic without knowing how they are tackling the fight. Obviously if 50% of your wipes are due to the tank dying then perhaps you could make some alterations to deal with that. If he is dying to saber lash issues, try having your tauren tank use a deviate each try (we found this helps a bit with hitbox issues) and perhaps try tanking it in a position where you can not be knocked into the air. I know bringing in more healers is not really an option for you always but it really helps in this fight. Dropping some caster DPS to get 9 healers does eliminate some of the risk involved.<br>
<br>
I think there will always be the attempts where you get crazy luck and cause wipes but I'm pretty confident we could kill it within 3 attempts every week, just need the roll of the dice to agree with us. We use an inherently risky strategy with most of the raid on one spot, but with careful positioning of where that one spot is you can reduce the chance of a FA being put next to them.</div>

		<div id="post_message_422541" class="post_message_underline">The highest hurdle on our first kill was probably FA survival -- once we (mostly) had that down, we were able to strategize around the other difficulties, most of which pertained to healing.<br>
<br>
MT gibbage was a recurring problem until we micromanaged heals a bit. A couple of paladins spamming Flash of Light, with a few other healers throwing out slower, more staggered heals has mostly eliminated early MT deaths aside from, say, unresisted Sinister Beam + Saber Lash (another one of those lovely combinations you just have to experience to appreciate).  Some tweaks to healer placement can also go a long way to reduce the number affected by a single beam or an unfortunate port (near them, not of them: half of your healers having to sidestep at the same is almost always trouble).<br>
<br>
Beyond that? Dunno. We try to keep the fight as short as possible by stacking physical DPS, and bring a few extra healers to ensure we can top everyone off before the next port is due. The fight's long enough that you can rotate every shaman through a healer group twice for Tide, and dry casters are encouraged to bandage everyone in range.<br>
<br>
The RNG factor with Shahraz is especially harsh, and we still can (and do) wipe even with seemingly perfect execution, but we are at least getting her down in just one night these days.<br>
<br>
I'm curious though if FA is really intended to tick damage against oneself.</div>

		<div id="post_message_422549" class="post_message_underline">The tank dropping dead can definitely be a fairly common showstopper, and it comes down partly to getting an attempt where that doesn't happen and where the other parts go right, which comes down to everyone playing well so that you don't ruin a good attempt.<br>
<br>
Our first week we figured out one part of the fight to help with tank burst and killed her in 2 attempts, this time we didn't have that issue but weren't that lucky.  So my original claim of repeatability dropped a bit.  Sometimes you will have 3 people ported on the tank, she'll parry one of the tanks attacks, and saber lash, with no avoidance, you're just not living through that without shield wall being up before hand.  That said, I don't think it happens that often, and I'm doing everything I can to prevent that, I would have killed to have the tauren racial while learning with how many times she did just about a 22k-22.5k damage burst to me when I had 21.7k hp, as is on our kills there were plenty of times that I saw my health under 20% (maybe even under 10) before that heal landed.</div>

		<div id="post_message_422553" class="post_message_underline">Hm I was only on our first kill, but mum's enrage seemed a bit like a joke to me. First time we reached 10%, we just killed her and we had a few guys down. She did not seem to do that much more then normally. I mean, I am sure we had SW avaible and used it, but I very much doubt it was up for the whole enrage.<br>
Our raid was not stacked at all for physical and we used eight healers, so our dps was pretty sucky. I guess you just had a bad luck wipe that took the worst possible moment to happen. <br>
<br>
@FA location: To me it seems totally random. We had the teleport happen towards every angle, looking from the boss and with greatly varying distance from her position. I really did not see any sort of pattern and having 1 big camp sounds like playing a game of russian roulette.<br>
Given that the fight has a certain amount of randomness (hey, you are still a 5-1 favorite in russian roulette after all!) and if you know your players react fast enough to actually survive the worst case scenario of FA right on the one camp, it might be the right way to go. But we had 17-18 ranged guys and given our raids usual reaction speed to this kind of stuff, I'd consider using a full cthun spreading and just hope healers spam the 1-2 guys in FA range before I'd go with 1 camp. </div>

As far as MT healing goes, I found that a simple warning on ventrilo when multiple MT healers get FA really helped. Micro-managing heals can be difficult because you never know when healers are moving to dodge a close by FA port or silently at their post healing the tank. Undoubtetly need your MT healers spread around your raid formation to minimize that effect.</div>

		<div id="post_message_422604">Yeah I've debated back and forth switching on a bit more SR gear, but I still hate the comprimise, because while it will help with getting ported on (and I've died to that), I've also personally seen times where if I just dropped 1000 hp I would have been gibbed by pure melee, it's the kind of fight where as you get more t6 level gear (since the god damn praetorian's legs don't count for this since I can't cap with em and SR) you can wear more SR and be more sturdy physically and the close call deaths become close call survivals.<br>
<br>
For Dawme, pretty much standard for that fight, the ironshield and full buffs puts that down to say 21k and you live.  I burned Ironshields every attempt every cooldown until we knew we were wiping, I used 29 on the night we got our first kill and over 30 for our last kill, plus several for the first pulls before we finished our SR gear.  It's more or less worthless to even try without full buffs on the tank cause he WILL get gibbed.</div>

With these pieces of information there are several spots you can put all the raid in and minimise the chances of people getting FA near the raid. Sure it will still happen, but only in around 20% of our attempts did we get it.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Yeah, as I review more logs, I think it's just a matter of micromanaging healing better.  Because mana can get so tight on the fight, healers can't just mindlessly spam for 6 minutes straight or they'll go OOM.  A large number of the deaths weren't to unhealable damage, but simply to 3-4 heals landing, overhealing, and then having 7.5k/8k/7.5k over the next 2 seconds just from hit/lash/hit, with maybe one fast heal landing in there.  Basic stuff, I suppose.</div>

	</tbody></table>
</div>Yes. After many, many, many attempts on Mother Shahraz and careful analyzing of what happens and causes us to wipe, we made a few changes that helped a LOT. We typically bring in an extra paladin now (so 4 total), and have two paladins spamming Flash of Light the entire time on the MT. Literally. While with a spam type of healing you're going to have overheal, what the flash spam does as a paladin is guarantee your tank gets at least 1500-2500ish more health to live with if he's taking massive burst combos. (Hit, Lash, Beam.. as people have noted, these typically add up to around 22-23k burst damage, giving your tank a little bit of a buffer inbetween there CAN and WILL mean the difference between life and death. Also, tauren racial is amazing here I bet). Since we have two paladins doing it, it's double that health pool so 3-5kish health bonus every 1.5 seconds. That'll give them just enough time to live and the rest of the bigger heals to come in. <br>
<br>
I pace myself very very well and don't have a healer group for the fight (no totems, etc), so I'm just working off heal cancelling and chain potting, and I don't stop channeling. (If it's gonna overheal cancel and recast, no idle time) But with 2 second holy lights and downranking, from the time i cancel my last heal to the time my next one is about to land, the tank has died many times. The small buffer heals inbetween really did help a lot. It was our way of giving our tank the health they need to live for the 'actual' heals to land.<br>
<br>
Aside from the healer micromanagement, it does just seem to 'get better' as people get more accustomed to playing in an absolutely horribly punishing setting. Like, it's really hard, death is itching at your heels, but you get better at it as time goes on. People will be more comfortable when FA'd and make it out alive, etc.<br>
<br>
We used to literally melt whenever people were ported near a camp, now, everyone shifts a lot more quickly and people actually get healed in the process, so we live now. <br>
<br>
This does not of course do anything to help against the stuff that is just guaranteed to fuck someone though (literally being ported underneath a couch that you can't get out of, chain wickeds, chain FA/knock until you die). But we've killed her with early deaths, and hey, if someone's important, there's always a battle res.<br>
<br>
The fight is definitely one I hate and I originally thought it was going to be an absolute pain to repeat every week since you learn right away what kind of random shit can happen (and often) cause deaths. But there's a lot of other stuff that at first seems ridiculously lethal that you just learn to deal with.  Not to mention it's honestly made people better healers I feel, because of how harsh it is as a healer. If you suck at all people gonna die, and you're also gonna oom very quick and be useless. <br>
<br>
Oh, and Imp LOH rotation is ++. After being the only paladin with 2/2 LOH for ages, I told one of our other pallies to spec into it to try it out in a real rotation. We throw one up at 50% and the other at 25% and they last full duration till the end, and it's quite a nice boost to the MT's survivability.</div>

A couple non-early-leashed pulls later and she died, with well under an hour of total time spent on her. <br>

		<div id="post_message_424574">I think that three changes have to be made to make this fight less terrible.<br>
<br>
(1) Replace the chaining toss with a chaining five second stun that also deals 3000 damage. This has precisely the same functionality as the toss, except it removes the instant-wipe toss on the tank/Saber Lash interaction.<br>
<br>
(2) Reduce the maximum number of stacks on the magic shields to five, or otherwise reduce their effect. Emphasizing physical dps is a neat idea, however, the implementation is terrible: magic dps is worse than physical dps by such a degree that you simply don't want to bring any unless you absolutely have to.<br>
<br>
(3) Add a delay of one second before Fatal Attraction deals damage, and make the graphic less obtrusive. I am sure that this fight was tested internally on state-of-the-art machines on a LAN. Unfortunately, in the real world, latency and graphical lag do exist. One second of leeway (even half a second!) would help compensate for this.</div>

		<div id="post_message_424585">Personally I'd make the FA pulses start off smaller and quickly ramp up to be larger than they currently are.  Don't punish people who have brief lockups when being teleported; if you can't code it so that she can't teleport people into a nook between a bench and a wall, then at least give people a fighting chance to get out.  Similarly, reduce the "oops they got ported onto the raid... again" factor.  If FA ticked for 1250, 1750, 2250, 2750, 3250, etc., instead of just 2500 every time, or some numbers similar to that, it'd be more punishing if you screwed up coordination of properly spreading apart, but less likely to just instagib you.  Even with high SR, if you get a port into a corner somewhere and you get a few bad resists in a row, you can basically take 10k damage in under 3 seconds, even if you play perfectly.  I'll be the first one to tell someone when they died in a situation they shouldn't have due to player error, but it's disheartening when there's really nothing to tell someone, or to tell the raid, besides, "Well, nothing to be done about that.  Leash her and let's go again."<br>
<br>
And yes, Prismatic Shield really needs some kind of an upside to it, to reward you for managing it properly.  Instead coordination just means that your casters are somewhat less screwed.</div>

</div>Yes.  There's a million spots where you can reproduce the same effect -- in various corners and such, where the wall slants or there's an overhang.  The couch/chaise/whatever offers the advantage of not squeezing you into a corner, so that there's more wiggle room on a bad FA port.</div>

</div>It does that already. In addition to being immune to FA, it's only possible for the tank to get knocked if you avoid all Saber Lashes for 30 seconds or longer. Fighting her at the couch might be a tiny bit better, but it's hardly necessary with a good amount of SR on the tank.<br>

The fact it happens in a phase which is controlled by resistance (almost as bad as full-raid fears imo) it's a pain in the arse.

</div>It is rough for that tank, but still 100% doable if he moves correctly and gets some extra healing.<br>
You can see where the next Eye Blast will go down if you check Illidan's position in the sky and plan your movement accordingly. He will also only move to one of the sides for the next blast, never across the room (which unfortunately makes it more likely to get 3 blasts on the same side).</div>

</div>Sure, why not? You can actually mitigate an unlucky stun with a PvP trinket, whereas with toss+lash, you can't do anything at all. It would make the fight more controllable and more interesting. Of course, an even simpler solution would be to have Saber Lash grant two minutes (or some other large number) of toss immunity, virtually guaranteeing that a well-geared tank can't dodge himself into wipe.</div>

</div>I don't think that this would be remotely viable, for a number of reasons (foremost among them - I am almost certain that Saber Lash hits a maximum of three targets), but if it is, who cares? Getting your raid cycled in front of her to take a Lash would require a fair bit of coordination, and would be a reasonable tradeoff for toss immunity. It's not "cheesing" if you're given the option of executing some difficult maneuver to mitigate a future risk - it's a design choice that encourages different ways of approaching the fight, which is often good thing.</div>

		<div id="post_message_425123">Just make Saber Lash have two components -- an avoidable physical attack and an unavoidable  debuff application.  Decouple the two.  It's not just the MT and Sinister Beam that's the problem.  OTs can, despite turning their back to her and actually doing /sit, still get missed repeatedly and ported.  It's messy.<br>
<br>
The harder issue with Shahraz is how to intelligently fix FA port locations without making it trivial or exploitable.  It really just shouldn't be an acceptable design element for her to potentially deathtouch 2-3 people if she feels like it.  Yes, there are "bad" ports, like ports on top of the raid, ports into a corner, etc., which are hard and painful but can be handled with skilled play and consumables.  And then there are "haha, you're fucked" ports like 3 people ported into a tree, into a bench, into a corner between a bench and a wall, etc., where you really can't even move, and it takes the lone survivor after the other two die another 5-10 seconds of turning and mashing jump to work his way out of that spot.  That's terrible.  If there's no way to fix the port locations, then I'd at least do what I suggested earlier and make the FA values start low and rapidly increase, so that you reduce the chance of unavoidable port deaths.  If you have max SR and you die to FA within 2-3 seconds of being ported, you pretty much got screwed by the RNG.  7500 damage (base, before resists) per second from the instant of a teleport is just too harsh.  With cap SR you can very easily take 8000-9000 damage in the first 3 seconds, and if you got teleported into a corner, there's no way to separate faster than that.  On the other hand, if you die to FA 5-6 seconds after being ported, you screwed up as a player.  I wish there were some way to distinguish between the two.</div>

</div>Hmm, I don't know about random, that wouldn't really be an improvement, and would just dumb the fight down -- the mechanic is interesting, but right now it's just harsh.  What if you paired up the elements -- fire/frost, holy/shadow, nature/arcane -- as opposites, and had a positive shield in one direction equal a vuln in the other direction? <br>
<br>
So what if a 9-stack of a fire shield meant that Shahraz took 10% fire damage and 190% frost damage, but then as you applied frost damage, it'd move in the other direction.  And so forth.</div>

</div>I agree with this wholeheartedly. As with the the RoS fight, not everyone has perfect server ping.<br>
<br>
Playing from the UK with slightly higher than normal latency doesn't help matters for me. Whilst it hasn't been a problem for any fight throughout the history of my time in wow,  I'm taking 1-2 ticks before I can even move/realise I've been ported. And it's UNBELIEVABLY frustrating. I shadow pot/healthstone/etc like a fiend and sometimes even blowing it all isn't enough. Bench/tree ports are just icing on the cake.</div>

</div>Going to assume Belt, Legs, Neck, Boots about? I think that would be 290 with no head enchant.  Trying to debate on cloak if I can afford losing all that defense.  <br>
<br>
Just curious as to his stats raid buffed if he knows them offhand. I think with Devotion I was about 32k armor (forget, but was hitting 39k with ancestral fortitude) 22.x HP and I forget my dodge atm, but on most parses I think I avoided 47-49% of all attacks - but like I said only 170 something SR. <br>
<br>
<br>
It seems for us we need to crank up the SR for everyone to max, FA was slaughtering people who were around 300.  1500 ticks compared to 750 ticks is a huge difference when some of our guys put on 365.</div>

<br>
I'm not that qualified on this subject, but as far as I understand it, the chance to resist something and especially to fully resist a spell does not go up linear (hope that's an english word, but it should be understandable what I mean. :P) with resistance. Afaik it works more like a stair. If you reach X resis, you have Y% chance etc. And the last few points of resis towards the cap are worth more then they are on paper.<br>
<br>
If someone actually ran tests past this, pls feel free to correct me before I spread too much garbage. </div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Is it natural to have an extreme dislike of Hyjal when first starting out?<br>
<br>
We've thus far done Rage Winterchill twice and attempted Anetheron's trash once. For some reason we don't seem that great at it though I have no doubt that'll get better with practice. The problem is that the majority of my guild and I find the concept of clearing eight waves of irritating trash for one shot at a boss slightly idiotic and completely bereft of fun.<br>
<br>
Black Temple on the other hand is overwhelmingly amazing right now. On our first night in, we cleared High Warlord Naj'entus and Supremus (half a raid at 80%, 8 people at 30%, what a joke of a fight) while finding our entire guild actually <i>enjoying</i> clearing the trash and wanting to do the optional pulls we could've ignored.<br>
<br>
Contrasting the two, I find it hard to justify scheduling Hyjal over Black Temple at this point in time and use the reasoning that as we get high level gear from the latter, the former will become more forgiving. At the same time, if Anetheron is as easy as I believe he is, it would be quite beneficial to get another boss on farm...<br>
<br>
Any advice on how to tackle our issues with Hyjal?</div>

	</tbody></table>
</div>Once you kill a boss in Hyjal its really easy to repeat it every week, basically not putting effort to trash at all. At the start we were sorting out what to do on trash, now we just clear it without paying attention to it, it really isnt that bad. Once you get used to it, you wont even notice how fast do those waves pass </div>

</div>I'd have to agree even though we've only ever done 4 pulls of RoS, we plan to kill it in our next 1 or 2 raid sessions - its really that easy (like 50% in phase 2 after 3 pulls).<br>
<br>
The main difficulty with RoS was knowledge.  The reason so many guilds took a long time on this fight was a lack of knowledge of the phases, the mechanics, and the issues like reflecting deaden.  <br>
<br>
Its not uncommon for guilds to kill RoS now their 1st night, after their 1st or 2nd look ever at phase 3 simply because they know what is coming.  <br>
<br>
Also, there is the mental block - a lot of people THINK RoS is hard because of how truly hard he WAS to learn back a month ago, and therefore never attempt him.  We would've done RoS before archimonde due to the ae trash mob payoff after had we known what we do today.  <br>
<br>
Gurtogg is going to be exceptionally easier with 9 or 10 healers vs 6 or 7.  <br>
Archimonde won't take you much time honestly to kill.  It will probably be 40-50 pulls, but that can be done in 2 nights.  Unfortunately it is a frustrating fight, but the rewards there are better than both gurtogg and reliquary combined.  The problem is, you probably want 9 healers here as well for learning.  With 5 decursers (although 3 decursers is actually PLENTY, decursing on this fight is fairly simple if you focus on it first), and 5 shamans for an ideal setup, you're looking at pain with only 2 shamans.  <br>
<br>
One problem is you'll have to reclear some of the gurtogg trash every 2 hours, but its worth the reward.</div>

</div>The more you can get, the easier it will become. If you can get 365 on everyone then it will be significantly easier, especially if you're willing to make everyone get shadow protection pots and use them when an FA happen to them/on the raid. <br>
<br>
If you can manage to get everyone full epic sets of SR, then its worth it. Most likely you can't, in which case you should get bracers and cloak for everyone, and then either belt, boots or both. Fill the rest in with greens as applicable, and then if you have hearts left over give them to your healers to get another piece crafted as they're the ones who will feel the pain most. If you want to do things most efficiently, stack your melee and healers with shadow res and bring the casters along as token fillers to take the FA in full greens. <br>

<br>
Thats our kill from tonight. As you can see, the casters do so much less damage than the melee that its hardly worth bringing them. Alaina died to the very first FA (screwed up and didn't use ice block - was his first time there i think) and we didn't bother using a combat res on him. I don't think voltan was paying any attention at all - not entirely sure what was going on with him. (The first wipe on there is rather hilarious - our MT had shahraz misdirected on to him, after which he proceeded to intercept her to numerous calls of "wtf" on vent. Turns out he has sunder and intercept in the same place and was going to start with zerk rage on but managed to miss changing stances afterwards. Instasaber lash, leash and we went again, geegee).<br>
<br>
I also think using the place where EJ killed her is rather stupid - we tank her right in the middle of the hallway and have never had issues with people being ported inside objects or getting stuck in corners. With the tank using a decent amount of shadow res (200+, I think ours uses 237 or something) the risk of knockup isn't great. Even if one of the offtanks gets ported/knocked, it's not something that is an insta-wipe situation while having 3 healers ported into a corner that they can't get out of without taking 8 ticks of FA is pretty damned hard to recover from. Imp LoH is also a very good thing to have a few of.</div>

		<div id="post_message_428276">Is it just me, or does hyjal make a lot more sense than doing BT?  I mean, we had no issues getting down the first 3 BT once we got everyone attuned and teron seems easy enough once we have a little time(see: 8 healers log on or tomorrow when we run out of stuff to do), but compared to BT, hyjal is an absolute cakewalk.  The worst boss in hyjal was azgalor, and that took us 4 tries to kill(4% wipe on 3rd try cause we didnt flask for it).  Kaz took like 2 tries, rage took 1, and anetheron took maybe 3-4 with garbage comp.  Basically, if you spend 2-3 days on hyjal, you can clear the entire zone besides archimonde, which gives you a very high valued target to kill.   Plus, you can do every boss in there with 6 healers(7 for anetheron), although bosskillers says it takes 8-9, which is absurd.  Is this just my opinion looking back on what would have been optimal, or do others just have different experiences.</div>

</div>Theres actually surprisingly little furniture in the part of the room we tank her (right in the middle of the path, about 50 yards in front of her next to the massive pillar on the left), although there is a small amount. I just don't see why you'd pick a place to tank her thats next to that horrible corner-bench-bit that looks like a deathtrap in itself just to avoid the knockup effect.<br>
<br>
Stormheart: It has been said in this thread that once you have Teron done, Hyjal is the next logical step. Bloodboil isn't too bad, but RoS can take some learning (especially if your interrupters have never done a fight like Kel'thuzad before and need to learn how to rotate-interrupt properly) and both aren't really as hard as Hyjal (as long as you have the shamans to stack on Archimonde at least). I think the majority of the dislike of Hyjal is that you can wipe without even seeing the boss and have to start again, and that can be very demoralising.</div>

</div>The warrior took a hit but didn't die! He usually breaks fear as soon as he can, which isn't absolutely required. I was also a bit slow or lagging that time.<br>
It would be nice to know if no deaths in all those attempts was just sheer luck or if the fear cast actually does reset Archimonde's swing timer.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I'm curious when people mention they see it following people - I don't think this was the case before the patch; if it follows people after the patch that is a rather huge mechanic change.  At best it might behave as someone previously describe: its a heat seaker missile, if you dodge it quickly it'll either acquire a new target or go aimlessly forward toward the hills.  <br>
But mostly it just seems to randomly maneuver, without turning too steep, favoring uphill climbs, favoring travel toward open area, and not going up the steepest slopes.  This is why almost invariably he was always aimed toward the east on kill videos.  Trying it both ways you sure get luckier when he's faced east...</div>

</div>In all our tries learning the boss and the kills we've had so far we've never noticed it following anyone, even after this patch. The fire is the same, it can zoom off into the distance doing no damage to anyone, or it can still trap your melee in a nice ring of fire. The only change's I noticed is he spawns them quicker so there are more up, and they despawn abit quicker, and ofcourse now they can spawn behind him. I don't think this makes him harder or easier, he's pretty much the same difficulty, it just makes it a more fun fight.</div>

</div>Don't mean to sound rude, but you need better decursers.  Our first kill was 2druids/2mages.  It affects one person at a time, every 5-10 seconds, and that's a nightmare?  The only real issues are spreading them (decursers) out, and the possibility of a Air Burst+Grip.  Even if that happens though, those affected should be prepared to HS/Pot while they and the decurser meet.<br>
<br>
I was asked to respec resto our first few attempts, and was warned about Grip.  After 15 seconds into the fight, I laughed and asked which of our newer mages had been to Sapphiron.</div>

</div>Pretty much.  It's just as unfair to alliance guilds that don't have dwarf priests.  I don't think anyone really cares about "Horde vs. Alliance" epeen at this point, and certainly not on these forums.  This really doesn't need to be rehashed, and certainly not in this thread.</div>

		<div id="post_message_418815" class="post_message_underline">We did archimonde tonight again with the new doomfires.  Basically the changes are:<br>
<br>
They behave exactly the same for direction choice.<br>
<br>
They spawn more evenly about the boss.<br>
<br>
They despawn faster.<br>
<br>
The space between elements of doomfire is much larger, therefore making the doomfire travel faster.  <br>
<br>
This means that you will have less issues of persistent doomfires in the raid, and less issues of persistent doomfires avoiding the raid.  <br>
<br>
What it means is you're going to have to deal with doomfires in your raid - it is still a terrible crapshoot, but it is more evenly random - if that makes sense.<br>
<br>
Basically, spread out more - what the EJ poster said above is what we came up with.</div>

We got our first kill last night but lost so much time aggro'ing all the NPC's, just had him pulled to thrall and had the MT run him over to the tauren camp. By the time he got over there he was about ~10-15 seconds away from first mark and at 95%, led to an exciting kill with taurens tanking the last 10 % or so! Just seemed like we were better off pulling him to the tauren camp (assuming enough lived through trash) and starting immediately.</div>

</div>You're probably experiencing the hitbox bug with large mobs - casters can hit them from a longer way away than the mobs spells cast range. Last kill we made sure casters were standing within the rain of fire range, and had absolutely no problems with it chain-casting on melee. It means casters have to move a bit more, but as they can be very spread out it makes a lot of sense for them to take rains as only 1 or 2 people should be affected.<br>

I don't think NPC's can get targetted directly.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I know Anetheron targets NPCs and totems for his cone attack, and based on how often the RoF seems to land on melee in Azgalor, I would say that it's the same deal there. <br>
<br>
Sounds like it might be a good idea to get thrall more involved than killing doomguards.  <br>
<br>
On a side note, I wish they would implement some type of 15 second delay past the start of combat which would bring all NPCs into the fight.   Not having to drag Khaz'rogal around and allowing both NPC packs to enter the fight would certainly allow for nicer positioning.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_430862 intelliTXT"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Phew, just got back from our first serious night of progression against Shahraz, and it was a doozy. We got her to 3% once (MT died at ~11%, rogues evasioned, etc) but were unable to duplicate our results. We could reliably get her to around 30% before things started breaking down.<br>
<br>
Most of our problems don't arise from MT knockback+instagib, or even bad FA positioning as has been mentioned elsewhere in this thread. We suffer from a severe lack of healer mana (I've been told that they ran completely dry near 15%, running on dregs and LoH from then on). We ran with 9 healers today, all in full epic SR gear (the 6 pieces that get you to 300 unbuffed). 4 pallies, 2 shaman, 3 priests and a druid.<br>
<br>
We also had only 6 physical DPS, our 4 rogues, a BM hunter and a fury warrior. All 6 physical DPS maintained upwards of 1000 DPS throughout the fight, while our casters cursed long and hard over vent about 'that goddam prismatic cockblock'. Our highest caster DPS was a lock who specced demo and did a significant amount of damage with his felguard.<br>
<br>
I'm confident we'll get her down tomorrow, but I sincerely believe we would have gotten her down tonight if we'd had just two more hunters instead of mages, or perhaps another resto shaman.<br>
<br>
After all the horror stories I've read on this thread, I'd say that Shahraz is actually easier than Archimonde once everyone hits the SR cap. But then again, I'm a rogue, and we might've gotten lucky with the FA ports (though some of our good attempts were ruined by people porting on top of the MT moments after a hit/lash/hit combo). We did get a few of those 'you're fucked' ports that people mentioned, with one of our rogues actually getting ported into a wall. After ~10 seconds of mashing jump and jerking around, he actually managed to fall INTO the wall and into a gray world of nothingness. Needless to say we wiped on that one. :P<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>What makes the Shahraz trash so profitable is there's just so many of those packs.  That's a lot of shots at gems, etc.  When we farmed, we would do a clear, then port out and do what ever you wanted for a half hour to let the zone soft reset.  Then go back and do it again.  We did this 3 times, and pretty much everyone got to walk away with an epic gem that day, for example.   Epic drops are a bit harder to quantify but I'd say on average there would be at least 1, if not 2 drops.  <br>
<br>
Not sure how you're handling the gems but for us it was a nice little perk to get some epic gems for personal use.<br>
<br>
Finally you really don't have to bring your whole raid to farm Shahraz trash.  We've 8 manned it the entire way, in about 50 minutes.  That might be a bit extreme, but if you only get 15 people interested in farming don't think that you can't do it -- because you easily can.</div>

<br>
Farming Hearts is one thing, handing them out is another. Your mages and locks may be a bit miffed, but I strongly recommend switching out as many of them as possible for physical DPS and healers. At least for a first kill (and probably for subsequent ones) stacking those classes is much preferred to caster DPS; rogues, hunters, warriors and properly specced druids/shamans can do more than twice the damage of equally geared and skilled casters. It's just that skewed.</div>

		<!-- message -->
		<div id="post_message_433649">After a significant amount of experience on Shahraz now all I can say is this fight is basically broken.  It is terribly overtuned, and basically unfun, poorly designed, and overall a really bad fight.  They've taken unoriginal and random ideas - mixed them together, and called it a fight.  I have to agree with Praetorian - this is a dumb fight.  <br>
<br>
That being said, the fight doesn't necessarily annoy me - I can tolerate it, but it is buggy.  Somehow it doesn't even come close to angering me like Archimonde does, and yet this fight is worse than Archifun.  There are a lot of serious issues that need to be fixed.  <br>
<br>
1.  She can saber lash the MT even though OT's are in position because of crappy hit boxes (dealable, but still a bug).<br>
2.  Saber lash debuff does not last long enough - meaning a good tank can, and will, have the invisible protection aura drop - meaning OT's will get FA'ed, and OT+MT will get punted.  (A bug)<br>
3.  She can FA a group of 3, and then sinister strike them, causing what is almost always unavoidable deaths - vile beam becomes close to unavoidable here, even with a HS, Pot, etc (I consider this a bug).  <br>
4.  FA can port you into unavoidable deaths - geometry specifically (definitely a bug).  <br>
5.  FA porting onto the raid makes the fight 10 times more difficult (a feature!).  <br>
6.  Two back to back FA's can vary in damage by 3 fold due to luck (a feature).  <br>
7.  The MT can be instagibbed a large number of ways.  I can't even begin to go into all the combinations.  This is a bug.  This can be mitigated by SR on the MT, but with parries you can still be instagibbed (&gt;24k in 2 seconds is instagib - this is a bug that is probably considered a feature).  We have a healing pattern down that can sustain indefinitely - but when sinister strike/FA (or my personal favorite, both) enters the fray, you can see some magic.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Some ridiculous elements:<br>
8.  This fight requires you to max SR.  It contains a mana drain as well.  (dumb) Edit: I'm told this isn't even resistable...<br>
9.  This fight hits harder than nearly any other in the game.  It is preferable to have SR on the MT. (dumb)<br>
<br>
Even while you can manage to fix/deal with half of these, the other half can and will wipe you even if you play like the son of man.  <br>
<br>
- We removed some of the random elements in this fight after I was literally punted, flew up, and was PUNTED AGAIN, before hitting the ground... all while dodging 1-2 saber lashes that obviously would've been wipes (which hit us 3-4 times tonight).  I intercepted, intervened.. didn't matter.  <br>
So to remove this insta-wipe, you want to tank under a couch/fountain (dumb).  <br>
<br>
- We use positioning that basically makes it so maybe 1 in 40 FA's land on the raid (in the alcove near where EJ took their killshot).  We stick the tanks in the couch.  This means that when FA lands in the raid, its a wipe, but its extremely rare (dumb!).  <br>
<br>
We probably will have this fight in the bag tomorrow, as we almost did it twice tonight, but I could just as easily see wiping for a few more nights until the stars align.  <br>
<br>
There are a lot of ways to fix this fight, but a few jump to mind.<br>
Pick any of these, or a combination of these:<br>
<br>
1.  No mana drain.<br>
2.  Make saber lash last longer, and act more reasonably with hit boxes.<br>
3.  FA is fatal attraction - you shouldn't nuke yourself with it - I honestly think like the prior DnT poster that this is a bug that it still damages you once you've broken links.  But whatever.<br>
4.  FA doesn't need to explode - it only increases the terrible randomness of this encounter.  <br>
5.  (heres an obvious one) Make FA not tick at time 0.  Make FA increase in damage over time, starting lower.  Punish bad players, and reward good ones...<br>
<br>
I know a couple of guilds who have done this for a few weeks now will explain about how this is a good fight and workable now, but no, seriously, this fight has issues that need to be fixed.  Tuning, bugs? yech.  I'd also invite people who like this fight to read their own guild's initial impressions here, which are quite amusing in hindsight.  <br>
<br>
Anyway, this fight is really everything that can be bad about a fight in 1 simple package.  All it needs is a berserk timer.  <br>
<br>
The leash is the best part of Shahraz, how sad is that?  Give this fight a runback, no leash, and don't fix everything above, throw in a berserk, and you'd probably lose half your raiding base.  I honestly think the devs are idiots after seeing this fight - I mean these games DO die eventually, and it is always due to a loss of quality - quantity not quality = TBC?  Tigole himself said he mainly cares about fights being fun.  Nothing about Shahraz is fun.  Everything before her is - and we'll probably end up spending as much time on Shahraz as RoS/Bloodboil whatever - but it'll have made everyone bitter/angry.  It will be nothing but a huge relief to drop this fight, and nothing but dread to repeat it.  <br>
<br>
PS: Oh did I mention?  Dps casters are screwed in the ass for no reason other than being DPS casters.  Our crew is basically 3 hunters, 3 rogues, 1 enhance shm, 2 dps warriors, 1 feral druid, 2 prot tanks, 2 demonology warlocks, 1 mage, 1 shadow priest, 9 healers.  I mean we stack this fight so badly it is nuts.  We're on pace to kill her in 5 or 6 minutes which will probably be a record once we can win powerball.<br>
<br>
They should rename this fight to Mother F#$@, because thats all I can think of when doing this fight.</div>

		<div id="post_message_433688">To a certain extent, if you're setting up the fight such that you accept a FA in the raid = wipe...it's hard to complain about FA ports wiping you.  Yes, luck with FA and her beam attacks will make or break any attempt, but putting yourself in a position where you're GUARANTEED a wipe doesn't make sense.   As for her instagibbing the MT, I don't know what to say.  By the second night of serious attempts, Paches just wasn't dying unless we were already down some crucial healers.  Yeah yeah, parry strings.  The MT shouldn't die, he just shouldn't, and looking at a strategy where that can happen and saying "Good enough for government work" is probably going to make mastering the fight that much harder.<br>
Just like Archimonde, it's very hard to make progress if something as basic as MT healing is in doubt.</div>

		<div id="post_message_433692">Well Quigon, your #2 is already being implemented in the next patch (2 min debuff granted when you're Saber Lashed) so no worries there.   I don't have a problem with needing capped SR, although of course screwing casters so badly is a pretty dumb design -- as I've said though, it's rogue revenge for Ouro. :P<br>
<br>
So they can fix the caster issue, make FA a little more forgiving at the start (but ramp up to be harsher) and make the animation a little less obnoxious -- honestly one of the hardest things about being ported in the corner behind a tree or bench is that you can't see shit with the animation.  Then by the time I figure out the direction out, I'm dead or nearly there.<br>
<br>
I dont think it's that far off from being balanced though.</div>

<br>
A few things you mentioned are easily fixable, and the fight does get more repeatable in less time as you kill her each week.<br>
<br>
But even with us killing her the past several times in less than 30 minutes of attempts, it's still a stupid fight.<br>

It will probably certainly be changed.<br>

		<div id="post_message_433773">As has been said, yes Shahraz gets better as you improve.  It's brutal to learn because unless you have a far better group of raiders than we do, as you learn a fight, you're going to make mistakes.  Not all 24 other people are going to stay calm and react perfectly to every FA.  But on those attempts where things do click and you're making no major errors, you still run a good chance of losing due to the RNG.  And then once that happens, not only are odds good that you're not going to play as well next attempt, but also it's demoralizing and tends to contribute to a loss of focus.<br>
<br>
But yes, as you practice more and more eventually the goal is to reach a point where your raid will never squander an opportunity at a kill through poor play.  But it's still stupid that even playing perfectly, you can have situations where you will lose 100% of the time.  That's pretty much the hallmark of flawed design right there.<br>
<br>
But there is no question that the fight will be changed in some way.  I mean as was pointed out to me, if you look at the 2.2 spell data, Saber Lash is a 2min debuff now.  Obviously they are looking at these things, and of course that stuff never makes it into the patch notes.  This is the first major patch since BT went in; I'm sure there will be substantial balance tweaks.  They really can't come soon enough though.<br>
<br>
Easy or hard, the simple fact is that every single person in my raid group dreads doing Shahraz every week.  It's like an actively unpleasant thing you endure to get to the good stuff beyond.  That shouldn't be the case, obviously.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">To a certain extent, if you're setting up the fight such that you accept a FA in the raid = wipe...it's hard to complain about FA ports wiping you.  Yes, luck with FA and her beam attacks will make or break any attempt, but putting yourself in a position where you're GUARANTEED a wipe doesn't make sense.   As for her instagibbing the MT, I don't know what to say.  By the second night of serious attempts, Paches just wasn't dying unless we were already down some crucial healers.  Yeah yeah, parry strings.  The MT shouldn't die, he just shouldn't, and looking at a strategy where that can happen and saying "Good enough for government work" is probably going to make mastering the fight that much harder.<br>
Just like Archimonde, it's very hard to make progress if something as basic as MT healing is in doubt.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>I guess you didn't quite read what I wrote, but we only have about 1 in 30-40 FA's on the raid itself - my point was more addressed toward the problem of the fight in the first place with FA randomness.  So that part is extremely rare - we set it up to prevent this circumstance from almost ever happening.  <br>
I also don't see how a MT is supposed to survive saber lash + FA + parry + vile/sinister.  Its something like 30k damage instantly.  Your evidence on the matter is fairly anecdotal, and I'm basically saying with 250 SR on the MT, you're going to die to these combinations (we never let AH drop either).  As for Archimonde healing as well - 5 parries in a row (no shit, 5 parries), and the tank can simply die.  I don't see how it is possible to avoid this.  Yeah we won the lottery to get 5 in a row with 10 weapon skill, but that doesn't change the fact that it happened, and I took 28k damage in 1.5 seconds, with demo, tc, AH, ironshield all up.<br>
<br>
I know some of you are able to somewhat repeat Shahraz - with 3-10 attempts or so... but I've also spoken with 2 guilds that have Illidan on farm, and have killed Shahraz 3 or 4? times.  The first guild one shot her 2 weeks ago, and spent 1.5 hours on her this week.  The other guild simply spent an entire night and never rekilled her, came back the next day, 3 shot her, and proceeded to 1 shot illidan and illdari (as usual).  For our efforts, we could easily kill her tomorrow, or we could not kill her for a week.  I honestly see us improving a little on FA's, but most of our deaths tend to come from FA + sinister, or FA on the melee inside the couch, or casting mana drain nonstop for over a minute.  I still can't get over the fact that you're forced to circumvent so many of these bugs by just ridiculous positioning - and that alone is going to ruin a raid night.</div>

		<div id="post_message_433907">Well Quigon, his evidence isn't anecdotal at all, I think it's safe to say that we've experienced a lot more Shahraz than you have -- I'm not saying this to be an ass, it's just the cold hard facts that our tank doesn't gib on this fight unless we've lost several healers first.  I'm not sure what the difference is, honestly 5 parries in a row sounds like you are Wi flagged or something.<br>
<br>
It certainly isn't a gear issue since you're basically the best geared tank out there, it certainly isn't a skill issue, and from your stories it's not an issue of mobs not being properly debuffed, so what could be the major difference then?  I'm saying this quite seriously, the difference between your experiences on both fights vs ours is quite drastic with respect to MT survivability.</div>

		<div id="post_message_433908">Quigon, I think you hold the world record for getting parried or something.  I'm not clear here how you are getting killed so many times to getting parried.  I have seen mobs parry multiple attacks off me simultaneously and never experienced a problem with them coming back at me for a pile of damage.  I would assume you have more than my 22k buffed hp, but I fail to see how you are dying(exception Shahraz) on these fights as a result of parrys as opposed to something else causing it.   <br>
<br>
Would you care to display some log evidence of what you are describing?<br>
<br>
Basically, in my experience, the only fight that there is a legitimate chance of me dying on is Azgalor, partly because we do it with 6 healers.   The only other time I might get into trouble is on Teron if multiple healers go down to shadows in a row.  Pretty much, if there are 7+ healers alive on a fight, I just don't see how it is even possible for an MT to die barring the most extreme luck factors, or a complete failure of the healers to do their job right.</div>

		<div id="post_message_433911">I'm not claiming to die on every attempt.  I'm only saying it is possible.  I think people misread that.  <br>
<br>
I died twice to instagib parries ever on archimonde - my problem is with the mechanic here, which is why I bring it up.  <br>
<br>
Shahraz is another story.  The first hour I died repeatably - mostly from solo saber lashes from either KB or targeting reticule.  We went to deviates, and wedged... and now my only deaths are from SR+melee combos.  I added more SR, and this went down - I didn't die for basically the final 2 hours, except twice where I had a double parry with sinister, before or after an FA.  I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one in this forum who has experienced insta-gibs on the tank though - even from shahraz killing guilds, shrug.  <br>
<br>
My point about anecdotal was in no way intending to diminish your experience.  But if it is a 1 in 20 chance of being instagibbed on the MT, it is more than possible that one guild will not experience it in 2-3 kills.  The quintuple parry still remains my greatest moment of "WTF?"  It was a windfury double parry-1HS, shield slam parry, shield bash parry, HS parry. On the swing timer, starting from full health - it looked like archimonde windfuried me 3 times.  The vast majority of the time though when a tank dies it is due to something completely controllable.  Demo, TC, lock dots, SB, AH, windfury up at the wrong times... etc.  <br>
<br>
On Shahraz for instance, we went to having neither OT attack except when is necessary for rage.  We went from windfury to GoA, and the damage reduction seen on the MT is significant.  Long term though this is only for learning attempts - and we'll probably add CoR and OT dps back in.  Shahraz and Archimonde healing are honestly fairly trivial 99% of the time.  Shahraz tends to get you with her SR abilities - even though overall they only constitute a small portion of her MT damage.  Archimonde you're more prone to dying during a fear, but this is of course controllable.  <br>
<br>
Personally this is how I feel the parry mechanic should work: parries by the MT should not lower the swing timer of the boss.  Parries by players other than the MT should.</div>

So thats why they do it. Iirc it also works like this for players too. If you parry an attack in pvp, your next attack comes faster. I guess it is also to encourage people to hit from behind and not in front.<br>
<br>
And yes its for one swing as far as I know. You attack a mob and it parries. Then he attacks you faster. Then his swing speed goes back to normal. Say your next hit also gets parried. Then he'll hit you faster again.</div>

		<div id="post_message_434307">Kind of disheartened to learn that most guilds one-shot Azgalor after wiping on him 3 times last night (always the MT dying, think to cleaves that came after a silence). Our healers that aren't bad - but healing got v. poor when they got a rain of fire over themselves. Not used Ironshield Potions in quite some time but we'll be going back with a nice big stack tonight. <br>
<br>
The spell description of the rain of fire is a little unclear and is different to what I observed - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071214061339/http://www.thottbot.com/s31340" target="_blank">Thottbot World of Warcraft: Rain of Fire</a> - at first I thought that the graphics were off (like @ Faerlina) since people were still taking dmg outside the Rain of Fire. I'm not sure that I understand how the Unquenchable Flames debuff works.<br>
<br>
We were using 2 druids, 1 Holy priest for HoTs with a paladin @ support, with another paladin healing @ the Doomguard tank and a shaman/paladin healing @ FFA. Don't think any of our paladins have imp Conc Aura. Don't know if that even affects the silence.<br>
<br>
Thinking of changing it so that the druids are @ NW and NE, with the paladin @ North - completely alone @ that side. Then spread the remaining healers (and raid) @ W, SW, S and SE, with the W and SW healers within 40 yards of the MT and 40 yards of the OT so that they can double up on raid and both tanks. Then assign the south healers @ healing a specific group as well as MT. <br>
<br>
Limitation of tanking Azgalor 100 yards away seems to have been lifted since the hotfix - although you probably don't want taurens/thrall clumping up too much.</div>

		<div id="post_message_434314">The rain does damage every 2 sec for 10 sec, if you take damage from it you gain Unquenchable Flames, dealing damage every second for 5 secs.<br>
<br>
So basically if you take one tick of RoF before you get out you would get <br>
0.00 RoF damage<br>
0.00 ++Unquenchable++<br>
0.01 UF damage<br>
0.02 UF damage<br>
0.03 UF damage<br>
0.04 UF damage<br>
0.05 UF damage<br>
<br>
Its just some nice bonus damage added on to the end of the RoF to make it very harsh if you just stay in all the time (5 rof ticks, 15 UF ticks if you never move) and to make the minimum it can deal be 6 ticks (assuming you don't get out so quick it never ticks at all).</div>

Positioning is very important in this fight. You need to position Azgalor in a way that makes it easy to spread out. The more spread you are the less people get hits by fire at the same time, thus less healers are trying to dodge RoF at the same time rather than healing.<br>
<br>
I've just been Main Tank healer in this fight, and I position myself so far away from everyone and everything that I've only been hit by RoF one time in total during ~5 kills.<br>
<br>
Also, if you have trouble keeping the Main Tank up during silence, even with several HoT classes on him, try having a few healers in capped Shadow Resistance gear. I tried this last time and resisted about 70% of the silences.<br>
<br>
Alternatively you can have a healer group with Improved Concentration Aura (reduces the duration of any Silence or Interrupt effect used against an affected group member by 30%) or the neck from Morogrim Tidewalker in SSC (<a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30008" target="_blank">Pendant of the Lost Ages - Items - World of Warcraft</a>) or Keli'dan the Breaker in Blood Furnace (<a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=29347" target="_blank">Talisman of the Breaker - Items - World of Warcraft</a>).</div>

</div>We use 8 healers for Naj and from the top of my head a few things that would help:<br>
<br>
a) Give your healers your shadowpriests, they'll need them.<br>
b) Get everyone to have 10k hp, I know you don't need more than 8,5k to survive, but 10k gives you a little leeway. That way not everyone has to be on full, but more or less on 85% hp. Throw your spine as soon as you can, don't wait for everyone to be at 100%. As long as they can survive it, you should be fine. <br>
c) Have a druid healing the raid, you said they were feral so I imagine it could be a little tough for them - we have a tree druid hotting up the raid and then 2-3 paladins assigned to MT, rest of our healers are group healing.<br>
d) Shaman on melee, of course. Any other Resto shaman  on a group. Chain heal is very powerful here.<br>
<br>
I really can't think of anymore things, he's not that hard, really.</div>

We tried the healing as you guys said I means shadow priest with healers etc. tough we didnt had any tree druid , wich might help a lot cos they are great raid healers . anyway thx for all teh info we will try again witha  little respecc and hope for "non crushing attempts" </div>

We did everything possible to help our healers out and we had a kill shortly after.<br>
<br>
Healthstones, Bandages (You can bandage fully every single minute) frost potions all help alot.<br>
<br>
I would agree with the above comment and add that 10k HP is an <b>absolute bare minimum </b>for this fight.<br>
<br>
Rogues can CloS out of the attack and dps warriors can go defensive stance to reduce the damage and melee is brutally effective on Najentus so buff them accordingly.</div>

Does this affect crushing blows on the MT ? <br>
If yes this might be the problem ..<br>
But noone is in 6y raduis of the MT if you mean that .<br>
We dismiss pets as they dies fast and dmg melee aswell....<br>

<br>
Priests with PoH are amazing at keeping a group up, a tree can keep a group up as well as keep some fat HoTs on the MT, Shaman are amazing at keeping up the melee and two Paladins should be enough to keep the MT up. If you have extra healers toss them on group assignments or help out with melee / Warlocks.</div>

</div>If that's happening in 2 seconds that's 100% a parry streak, Naj'entus can't attack 3 times in 2 seconds by himself.<br>
<br>
So the suggestions I would make:<br>
<br>
Make sure only the MT is meleeing from in front, this reduces the chances for parry streaks.  A parry streak will lead to shield block charges getting eaten and a crushing is possible.<br>
<br>
Keep your tank topped off, don't let him get low, because a poor timed parry can always let one crushing through, and the tank should be able to survive it.<br>
<br>
Ensure Demo shout and Thunder Clap are up all the time, 9k crushing from Naj'entus seems high from my recollection, but then again my gear is a lot better than a fresh BT guild's tanks.<br>
<br>
If you're still having problems with it, have the guild invest and buy some ironshields, your tank should have no problem hitting almost 15k maybe a little higher hp unbuffed, with full buffs he should be close to surviving a spike like that, and if the 2500 extra armor saves him from a burst killing him, he's got time for heals to land.<br>
<br>
<br>
Personally I don't think you will need ironshields, but they do give a buffer on progression content that is a nice thing to have.  But minimizing parries in front of him and keeping the mob debuffed can make a world of difference.</div>

		<div id="post_message_436166">In the Illidan encounter, does anyone have a way to tell where the Azzinoth elementals will leash? Our tanks seem to have lost their nerve after a bad wipe caused by leashing+enraging and seem to be causing more wipes by standing in fires because they're too nervous to move out of them. I'm curious as to how other guilds handle this phase, because the hectic nature that we handle it in really doesn't seem to lend itself to the 'repeatable' tag which has been attached to this fight. :P</div>

		<div id="post_message_436464">Random question that maybe only a few people here (Nihilum, Curse, etc.) can answer.<br>
<br>
I know that the initial wave of BT buffs increased Teron's melee damage and made Bloodboil tick every second instead of every 3, and last a bit longer.  I believe RoS was unchanged (?).<br>
<br>
But what was different about the original versions of Shahraz, Council, and Illidan?  I assume abilities didn't hit as hard, but which, and how much less?  Also, in Nihilum's original Illidan kill video, I noticed that the tank on the west Flame in p2 tanked it the entire time with zero Blazes on the ground.  Were there any other changes, then, besides just making things hit harder?  <br>
<br>
Just idle curiosity about something that very few people got to see before it was changed.</div>

		<div id="post_message_436519">Illidan:<br>
<br>
The Blazes worked with resists, so a tank in full FR would resist the breath and no blaze would spawn, they seemed to hit harder than they currently do as well, at 30% after the shadow prison, the aggro was completely messed up, he would chase down casters for quite a while before he would go back to the tank, even with fast bop's 4-5 casters could easily die. Illidan didn't hit as hard, so shear wasnt a wipe, we actually had a druid tank him who took every shear and he would never die, we had to change to warrior tank ofcourse after the damage buff.<br>
<br>
Council:<br>
<br>
The main change was the damage output of everything, the bosses and the aoe's they do (twice as much damage now? not 100% sure here either). Im not 100% sure but the reflective shield wasn't on the priest in the early version.<br>
<br>
Shahraz;<br>
<br>
Was exactly the same apart from her melee damage, I was looking through our first kill video earlier infact and could see all the off tanks and even a pet melee her from the front, try that now and it would be some crazy damage on the tank, basically you never had to worry about the tank dieing, ever.<br>

40+60+30+30+43+30+24+39 = 296, add on aura. I don't think you can easily avoid using the heroic badge items, unless you want to risk it without crit immunity by using greens. Crit immunity is pretty much needed - a 25% resist + crit = ~15k spike damage, which is just damned nasty with all the rest of the damage flying around. Resillience is especially good for getting crit immune for it, but defence is good for the extra avoidance. Using the +30 resillience guardian elixir might be worth it too, if you're a bit short. I normally use a flask though - 20.9k health without imp/commanding isn't bad.<br>

- Red Soul Charges silence for 4 seconds instead of 6 seconds.<br>

Mother Shahraz<br>
- The players targeted by Saber Lash now gain the immunity to Sinister Beam and Fatal Attraction, regardless of whether or not Saber Lash actually landed.<br>
- Shahraz will now pick a new beam to cast after every 3rd cast, instead of every 5th.<br>
- The first two seconds of Fatal Attraction now deals reduced damage.<br>
- Prismatic Shield has been completely reworked. The shield is no longer adaptive. She periodically picks a random school to be resistant to, and the "opposite" school gets a bonus. Casters rejoice.<br>
- In a later patch, we're blocking off some of the nastier places to get placed by Fatal Attraction, and the "Couches of Death" we'll be fixed. In the meantime, you should be able to mitigate a problematic Fatal Attraction teleport by tanking Mother Shahraz away from these locations.<br>
- Also in a later patch, we'll be able to disable the "decreased melee swing time" effect caused by Mother Shahraz parrying a melee attack. The parry mechanic is exacerbating the already rather intense burst damage that Mother Shahraz can inflict.<br>
<br>

</div>It is particularly germane that Blizzard would note the parry mechanic (however only specifically in relation to Mother Shahraz?) due to Quigons recent experiences.<br>
<br>
Also, my guild is currently on Shahraz (however, we havent actually started the trash to her yet), I'm assuming this is a fairly large nerf? Regardless, the Spirit of Redemption on Archimonde and the Spirit Shock/Rune Shield are very much welcomed changes.</div>

</div>I think you are underestimating the dmg that comes from casters suddenly. We never had the luxury of having more then five to six physical dps (so 2 rogues, 1 dps warrior, 2 hunters, 1 feral druid plus the 2 non-acting off tanks). I'd guess the shield change will mean that for us she goes down about 20% faster. Depening on how much the boost to the non-blocked schools is, it might even be 30-35%, which is a gigantic nurf.</div>

		<div id="post_message_438054">Well more dps on the boss will also allow you to lose more people to FA and still get her down. If the amount of healing/dps is right, you probably can do 15% with 15 people easily, her enrage is not all that dangerous.<br>
<br>
Also (yeah, I know I brought it up before but the other side keeps bringing it up again and again as well ...) if you want to rely on play skill/faster reactions and less on a lottery, really try more then one camp. It really makes the bad FA = wipe a looot less likely to happen. Just the amount of healers that do not have to run in the other camps and then can throw heals around helps.</div>

40+60+30+30+43+30+24+39 = 296, add on aura. I don't think you can easily avoid using the heroic badge items, unless you want to risk it without crit immunity by using greens. Crit immunity is pretty much needed - a 25% resist + crit = ~15k spike damage, which is just damned nasty with all the rest of the damage flying around. Resillience is especially good for getting crit immune for it, but defence is good for the extra avoidance. Using the +30 resillience guardian elixir might be worth it too, if you're a bit short. I normally use a flask though - 20.9k health without imp/commanding isn't bad.<br>
<br>
Check the damage in chart:<br>

Total fire damage mitigated: 67.2%. I did get horribly screwed over with 3 (or it might even have been 4) lasers in a row, so the blazes were slightly out of control at points. My mob also got DPSed second, which explains a bit, but it's still a stupid amount of damage.</div>

</div>Agreed. Basically when you can kill Kael, you can clear Hyjal. That means you have at least 3 BT bosses and 5 Hyjal to gear up. More then enough. Kill vashj/kael 3-4 times max, then I'd focus on t6 instances.<br>
The sad truth is: If someone lacks gear, he can as well get it from karazhan, which you can easily do on non-raid days. THe stuff is somewhat worse then T5 instances ofc, but it is enough to go all the way in BT - minus melee weapons. Those can be obtained through arena though.</div>

</div>I don't think we may a conscious decision to drop ssc/tk, when we had anything left to learn or kill in BT/Hyjal we went there, and the only reason we would go back to tk or ssc was to attune new members or people who have been on holiday.<br>
<br>
I think what really hit home with SSC was going there and disenchanting all but 3 items from a full clear (granted we didn't get the best drops)<br>
<br>
Now we have cut down on raiding alot to give members more time to enjoy the summer (or in britain the lack of one)<br>
<br>
We raid Wednesday - hyjal (full clear + 2-3 BT bosses)<br>
Thursday - rest of BT<br>
And alternate between SSC/TK each week on either sunday or monday.<br>
<br>
Personally this isn't as much as I would like, I find myself with free time to do stuff, which seems kind of odd after 2 and a half years of 5-7 day raiding.</div>

Those mobs like Vaelastrasz, and Illidan, that look toward the person they're casting their secondary abilities on.  While they're looking away like this - any melee dps standing where he temporarily faces will proc a HORDE of parries.  I took about 30k damage instantly on Illidan due to this.  It is manageable with positioning, but clearly another bug that should be looked at (I'm not complaining about the Illidan fight, it is leagues beyond Archi/Shahraz).</div>

Resillience is especially good for getting crit immune for it, but defence is good for the extra avoidance. Using the +30 resillience guardian elixir might be worth it too, if you're a bit short. I normally use a flask though - 20.9k health without imp/commanding isn't bad.<br>
<br>
Check the damage in chart:<br>

Total fire damage mitigated: 67.2%. I did get horribly screwed over with 3 (or it might even have been 4) lasers in a row, so the blazes were slightly out of control at points. My mob also got DPSed second, which explains a bit, but it's still a stupid amount of damage.</div>

</div>Yeah - you could also just stack resillience gems in all the fire res craftables too (although I'm not sure if the plate ones have sockets). That along with PvP bracers and the chest enchant is pretty much capped.</div>

<br>
Those mobs like Vaelastrasz, and Illidan, that look toward the person they're casting their secondary abilities on.  While they're looking away like this - any melee dps standing where he temporarily faces will proc a HORDE of parries.  I took about 30k damage instantly on Illidan due to this.  It is manageable with positioning, but clearly another bug that should be looked at (I'm not complaining about the Illidan fight, it is leagues beyond Archi/Shahraz).</div>

</div>I am not trying to single you out or anything, but do you have an SS that shows that 30k instantly? That seems pretty insane, as I have never seen close to that. A 15k burst on me has happened before but that is easily survivable since you have the majority of heals on you in P1 &amp; P3. I am trying to wrap my head around how 30k is even possible, that is like 5 hits at least in under 2 seconds, or was it preceded by a draw soul or something. <br>

</div>I want to say that we had a 21k spike within 2 seconds on our tank last night during Phase 1, but I don't have the logs to prove it.<br>
<br>
It went something like this:<br>
<br>
00:00 Hit for 6k<br>
00:00 hit for 3k<br>
00:01 hit for 6k<br>
00:02 hit for 6k<br>
<br>
<br>
I'll be logging our attempts later this week and maybe we'll see such a streak again.  But from a healer's perspective, I've definitely seen our tank drop from full to almost zero without a Shear landing.</div>

		<div id="post_message_440506">I also highly suggest getting crit immune and capped fr, having healed various tanks on phase 2 illidan, I know what kills and what doesn't. Warriors can get crit immune (without resilience) and capped FR with pretty easy to acquire gear, here is the setup I had in mind for preparation:<br>
<br>
Back:	Wyrmcultist's Cloak		(+15 Fire Resistance)<br>
Chest:	Inferno Tempered Chestguard	(+8 Fire Resistance)<br>
Feet:	Inferno Tempered Boots	(+8 Fire Resistance)<br>
Left Finger:	Ring of Sundered Souls<br>
Right Finger:	Band of Eternity<br>
Hands:	Flamebane Gloves		(+8 Fire Resistance)<br>
Sockets: +8 defense dawnstone, +12 stam gem. Socket bonus: 3 parry<br>
Head:	Eternium Greathelm		(Defense Rating +16, Dodge Rating +17)<br>
Sockets: 5 def 4 dodge gem from Sethekk, 8 def dawnstone, 12 stam. (socket bonus: 4 dodge) <br>
<br>
Legs:	Inferno Tempered Leggings	(Stamina +40, Agility +12)<br>
Neck:	Frayed Tether of the Drowned<br>
Shoulder:	Warbringer Shoulderguards	(+7 All Resistances)<br>
Sockets: two Void Sphers. (+4 res all each). socket bonus: 4 defense<br>
<br>
Left Trinket:	Moroes' Lucky Pocket Watch<br>
Right Trinket:	Scarab of Displacement<br>
Waist:	Girdle of the Invulnerable<br>
Sockets: typical, dodge or parry+stam heroic gem, and +12 stam<br>
<br>
Wrist:	Wristgaurds of Determination	(Stamina +12)<br>
Mainhand:	Mallet of the Tides<br>
Offhand:	Shield of Impenetrable Darkness	(Stamina +18)<br>
Ranged:	Gyro-balanced Khorium Destroyer<br>
<br>
This comes out to unbuffed stats of (for a human warrior) <br>
<br>
291 defense rating (right at the cap for 73s)<br>
12714 hp<br>
19% dodge<br>
15.83% parry<br>
26 hit rating and some weapon skill<br>
260 fire resist.<br>
<br>
260 fire resist you say? yes, you use chromatic violet eye flask, for 35 resist all and 10 extra stats.<br>
for now, you could change a bit of that (1 piece of gear ish) and get the 295 unbuffed req. for now<br>
Using this style of resistance gear gets you a lot more avoidance, for possibly slightly less hp. And of course, being crit immune without wasting itemization on resilience.</div>

</div>It was a one time thing - happened when he was casting parasite, turned - melee procced parries (or I did), and I dropped in under 2 seconds with last stand up.  Wasn't a shear of course.  It has not happened since, in a lot of attempts.<br>
I didn't screenshot it - as it was one of our early attempts, I assumed it was normal.  You can choose not to believe me  I don't care either way.  <br>
It reminded me of sebudai's log of azgalor killing the tank almost instantly - but that was due to NPC parries.  <br>
<br>
The point was about how non tanks will get parries on bosses that have a secondary direction cast - like you'll notice rogues with parries on shahraz.<br>

</div>well i know that he dont crush, however what i used to do was wait for him to begin casting Shear and then hit SB. However i was just curious if Shear could be entierly avoided without the means of using SB. Raid buffed and wearing full tank gear i am about 0.4 or so off the required amount, therefor i would have to switch one of my rings to reach that point. I just do not want to cause a wipe due to me wanting to lazy man it.</div>

Yeah, my guess to this is that Illidan does get a DW penalty, and that it's built into the design of all DW mobs, but to counteract it to make him still deal hefty damage they gave him +hit, but the result of whatever they did is just that Shear can't miss,</div>

I am trying to wrap my head around how 30k is even possible, that is like 5 hits at least in under 2 seconds, or was it preceded by a draw soul or something. <br>

<br>
Last night when we killed them, our mage tank went LD 30 seconds into the fight.  The mage tanked for anohter 20 seconds while it took him to drop from the world.   Luckily our other mage was quick enough to use that time to get agro and start spell stealing to pick it up.<br>
<br>
Obviously if this happens later in the fight, you will probably run into agro issues.  You might be able to save it withi a couple good misdirects to pass Healer agro, but it would be close.<br>

Just wanted to put it out there that even if shit goes wrong, it is possible to improvise and get stuff back under control.</div>

Question regarding Illidan:<br>
Does any1 have any issues with the traps? I mean, on our "almost-1st kill", we had him in a trap, burned to 9%, he was not faced to the raid when dragged into the trap, main tank didnt change his position (so he would be still not facing raid), and suddenly, after the trap went of, he cast Draw Soul, straight into the raid, regenerated to 24%, and then started hitting main tank again, like nothing happened. It was really annoying, as we didnt know what was that supposed to mean, as if it was overagro - he would go for someone.. but he just sticked to the main tank. Managed to take him down to 9% again on that try, but that was it  Is there any special mechanic regarding the trap?</div>

Regarding Illidan: is there any rhyme or reason to the flame elemental's charging? We do get a fair amount of charges that are non fatal, but I can't help but wonder if it's intended that they can charge and then breathe while facing the raid.<br>

Also, what's up with totems? Another guild reported little to no problems using totems that were cast 'inside' the small circle.

</div>They charge anything that enters combat after they spawn - if our shamans put totems down before the elementals spawn, in the grate, then they're generally OK, but if they get put down late, then they get charged. The same goes for getting battle ressed or ankhed during P2 I believe, or ressing / summoning a new pet. Using FR is useless, the Fireballs Illidan throws on the raid are not resistable.<br>
<br>
The elementals can still charge things just randomly during P2 which is annoying, but the majority of the time it seemed to be traceable to a shaman putting a new totem down.<br>
<br>
edit: Someone else from my guild just informed me that I'm wrong and the Fireballs are in fact resistable, however, they're binary, and are probably a higher level spell than 73, as in our kill last week, only 6 of them were resisted throughout all of P2.</div>

</div>Kael'Thas - in my opinion, is the hardest boss in the game.  He is also probably the best boss in the game.  <br>
<br>
Another way to put it: if you can kill Kael'thas, your guild is capable of killing Illidan.<br>
<br>
We spent 4 days on Kael, 3 on shahraz and Illidan, and 2 or less on the rest of BC.<br>
<br>
You're in phase 5 - keep it up, and good luck.  Congrats on at least making it to the "easy" phase (although I'm sure that sounds shitty at this point).</div>

</div>I think Kael'thas took us around 5 wipe nights and a kill night, we had two 2% wipes because our weapons despawned, and had about three P5 bugs, where he floats in the air and stops doing anything and can't be targeted/damage (have everyone run to the back of the room, alt-F4, and log back after a minute or two to reset him). Vashj took us 3-4 days as well.<br>
<br>
After that, if took us four progress nights to kill 3 Hyjal and 4 BT bosses (Akama bugged on our 4th pull, but he should have died that pull or the next anyway).<br>
<br>
Kael'thas requires full awareness, focus and execution and is very unforgiving until a few seconds into P4. The first four Hyjal demons and and the first half of BT bosses are much easier to learn and execute from what I've experienced.</div>

</div>Quigon doesn't touch on this, but ultimately, Archimonde is "easier" because of attrition rate. When he talks about Kael'Thas being the "hardest," you have to consider the attrition placed on your raid.<br>
<br>
1) You have to sit through Phase 1, every wipe.<br>
2) Two hour trash respawn. Clearing trash takes the biggest toll on our raids, and trash was the only limiting factor to performance on pre-Archimonde Hyjal encounters. Trash sucks.<br>
3) The weapons -&gt; advisers phase(s) are a number crunch and can be very overwhelming to coordinate.<br>
<br>
Come Archimonde, if you wipe, you re-engage 5 minutes later at the same "point" in the encounter. You know every ability of Archimonde's within minutes of engaging and a good idea of how to counter. Kael'Thas can be much more involved, and you have to wait upwards of 20 minutes to test a strategy against a particular ability.<br>
<br>
In the end, we probably wiped more to defeat Archimonde, but he was no where near the mental drain Kael'Thas induces.</div>

Naj'entus, Supremus, and Akama - We killed these within their two hour trash timer, so it's hard to speak for them.<br>
<br>
Teron - Quickly repeatable, if you pull to his doorway. Only two two-pack pulls for a reclear.<br>
<br>
Gurtogg - Recoverable in his room for as long as you intend to make attempts -- no trash reclear.<br>
<br>
RoS - Simple, two minute gauntlet clear.<br>

Shahraz - Leash and minimal reclear of her room.<br>

Illidari Council - Recoverable in their room -- no reclear.<br>

Illidan - No trash.<br>

Black Temple may have a few too many trash pulls, but it's not so bad. We have a lot of fun on vent. And we often get more / better loot from trash than their proceeding bosses. There are no lava packs or 10x 1mill HP mob explosions, so I can't complain.<br>
<br>
Then again, the original Hyjal (and current) trash has probably made me numb to Tigole's sick dream for trash.</div>

</div>I'd say the hard part of Kael'Thas is having to listen to his annoying speech every time you pull him. Bad memories flash back about Gothik... how I hated that speech...<br>
<br>
In all fairness, maybe it's because we have the fight so under control now that I forgot how hard Kael is, I guess it's just the same deal. One fuckup or death and you're pretty much a goner. Although you can just combat res on Kael and keep going... On Archimonde depending on the class who gets killed it's good game and you can wipe at 99%. And combat ressing is a bit dangerous on Archimonde, since the person who gets ressed has no buffs and is just likely to die again.<br>
And Kael'Thas is just a lot more complex, I suppose.</div>

Every wipe I can recall on Archimonde (except for that one time last night where 6 people D/C'd due to a network issue on Blizzard's end, gotta love the Stormstrike battlegroup) is due to player error.<br>
<br>
"Luck" manifests itself in that sometimes you can get away with errors, and sometimes you don't.  You can stand 5yd from a Doomfire with your trinket on cooldown and get feared away from it, or you can get feared into it and run along its length.  You shouldn't have been there in the first place.  You can have someone running right past your MT with no ill effects, or it can get your MT Air Bursted.  Shouldn't have been there regardless.  And so forth.  Unless you have some horrible class makeup (only 2 decursers total or something), you should be able to spread healing/decursing around the area such that people can't find themselves stranded without either, and if they do, it's because they went somewhere they shouldn't have.</div>

We wiped twice on the same Rage Winterchill trash wave in the last 2 nights due to multiple people (5+) disconnecting in the middle, thus putting us behind on that pull, which starts an endless chain of falling behind. The first night we just said screw Hyjal and went to BT but last night we decided to re-try after it happend (it was probably the same one that screwed you guys!) and managed to get lucky with the lag for the rest of the night and continued on to 1-shot the first 3 dudes.<br>

When the lag hits when you're standing around buffing then that's all that happends. If you're in the middle of a large fight with lots of stuff going on that's when it seems like many disconnect.</div>

</div>Blizzard has a lovely tendecy to refuse to be consistant with how these thing's work. For instance, Nether Protection doesn't proc off of anything from Leotheras. Even if it does proc off of Illidan, I'm not sure he's considered a caster primarily or whether he's considered a melee mob primarily (although I guess if he decides to run forward and melee me because Nether Protection procs, it won't be much help.) Anyways it's best to know about the fight in specific, Nether Protection is pretty buggy ever since Blizzard screwed with it's functioning with AoE affects.</div>

</div>Didn't it work once though a LONG time ago?  I recall people saying they used it for Illhoof - but when we tried it the warlock lost aggro immediately.  <br>
This would be a neat little tool to use on these "Warlock tank" fights.  I still feel obligated to spec our locks into soul link for illidan and leotheras - not because we HAVE to, but because any little edge might make or break an otherwise solid kill.  And at 100g for a double spec it seems worth it.</div>

<br>
Oh, you've always lost agro with Nether Protection tanking the imps on illhoof. Intensity is the more important Destro talent for that fight - with conc aura you can just Hellfire indefinitely, makes the imps pretty trivial.<br>
<br>
I haven't considered it worthwhile to spec SL for Illidan. You lose a pretty hefty chunk of DPS in P2 and P3 for a survival upgrade in P3, but it's really not that hard to heal the warlock tank. In my full SR, I do almost as much damage as the frost mages in P2, and probably more than melee if the lazers aren't really lucky.</div>

</div>That just doesnt make any sense to me.  I watch my combat logs quite often and when things go wrong, im sitting there scrolling through it to see exactly what went down.  I have never seen a "failed to dispell" or anything besides a successful spellsteal or a resisted one.<br>
<br>
Screenshot it next time?</div>

8/11 20:37:45.130  Stion fails to dispel High Nethermancer Zerevor's Dampen Magic.<br>
8/11 20:37:48.622  High Nethermancer Zerevor's Arcane Bolt hits Stion for 12997 Arcane damage. (1274 absorbed)<br>

Next attempt:<br>
<br>
8/11 20:44:15.452  Stion casts Spellsteal on High Nethermancer Zerevor.<br>
8/11 20:44:15.670  Stion fails to dispel High Nethermancer Zerevor's Dampen Magic.<br>

</div>We had that happen once when we were learning it last week. We couldn't figure out what the hell it meant. Also one time the combat log said that Zerevor Spellstole the shield back instantly once it was stolen??? Many people in the raid saw this, the combat log definitely said exactly that. Both these things happened on the initial pull, never during the fight. Our only explanation was some sort of weird combat log error that was caused by latency or....something. I really don't know. The timing on the initial pull is pretty close and mages are spamming the button as they run in so maybe it's some weird anomaly having to do with range and latency.<br>
<br>
Edit: I see you had the same thing happen with Zerevor stealing the shield back. That is just too weird.</div>

</div>Well, it says Zerevor stole it, for whatever reason.<br>
<br>
The only issues with Spellsteal that I know of are Gathios' resistance aura and Malande's shield thing which makes Zerevor immune to Spellsteal. But I am no mage.<br>
<br>
I assume you have your mage initiate the pull?</div>

</div>I have seen this one, did it to me once.  Im not sure what/how this happens.<br>
<br>
As far as failed to dispel, it must be some sort of combat log bug and is the same as "resist" being dispel is generally what a spellsteal is doing is dispelling it from High nethermancer, but just gives the mage the buff.  So I honestly couldnt tell you.  I havent witnessed the "failed to dispell", but I have seen the one above.</div>

<br>
Those mobs like Vaelastrasz, and Illidan, that look toward the person they're casting their secondary abilities on.  While they're looking away like this - any melee dps standing where he temporarily faces will proc a HORDE of parries.  I took about 30k damage instantly on Illidan due to this.  It is manageable with positioning, but clearly another bug that should be looked at (I'm not complaining about the Illidan fight, it is leagues beyond Archi/Shahraz).</div>

<br>
22570 damage with no real way to counter it. Although, that is our gnome DPS warrior willing to use himself as a shield next time it happens. He turned to cast parasite turned around and destroyed me. I didn't even get a chance to blink before he killed me. I did dodge one attack I guess lucky me. Only happened once tonight.<br>
<br>
I understand why the parry mechanic is there, but some of these bosses put you in a situation where you can't survive. I suppose with better positioning we could minimize it. Hopefully someone from Blizzard will look at this and see that the parry mechanic isn't functioning correctly. I can live with killing myself, but I can't see how the mechanic is functioning correctly when bosses turn to cast some other ability and it ends up killing the tank.</div>

</div>We had this happen as well and didn't get anything. I think the last thing they told us was that they will look at it once more, but that was like 3 or 4 weeks ago. The problem is that there is no killing blow and nobody is left alive when Illidan actually dies. We asked for a shaman to ankh up during the death animation, but they were all used. No idea if that would help.<br>
<br>
Just to compare, we did get loot on Azgalor before when Thrall died to the RoF tick just a second after the kill, which made Azgalor's corpse disappear. That time we clearly had the killing blow though.</div>

		<div id="post_message_449283">We actually had a shaman ankh during the scripted event(after our last player had died), sadly you can't target Illidan once its started and healing himself to full did nothing to retap him to our raid.  The problem like Dots has said is there is no killing blow from a player since the scripted event has Maiev kill him for you.  The line "Illidan Stormrage has died." does indeed show up in the combat log but, the Raid Specialist stated they needed a killing blow line to distribute loot to the raid group.</div>

<br>
Someone had read and suggested that the Flames will only charge totems that are created after they spawn.  We made it a point to only drop totems as Illidan was flying into the air, but it seems like the Flames were still randomly charging someone in the group and causing chaos.  <br>
<br>
We ended up completely giving up and dealing with phase 2 without any totems.  As a result we had 3 or 4 clean phase 2's in a row which led to our kill.  Has anyone else shared the same experience?  It seems like a fairly annoying bug.</div>

		<div id="post_message_449454" class="post_message_underline">We don't use totems at all on phase 2.  <br>
<br>
The intended behavior, as far as I can tell, is that the Flames have a charge with a large minimum range, such that if a player is more than X distance (ballpark guess is 60 yards) from a Flame, the Flame will charge him and usually break its tether in the process, and you lose.  This is to prevent you from spreading out all around the terrace and not having to deal with beams/fireballs.<br>
<br>
However, something about totems make them go nuts and charge regardless of range.  It's not a surefire thing, and I don't think it has to do with when they're dropped.  I've seen people drop Tide mid-phase and get away with it.  And I've seen WF totem down before the Flames spawned and get charged immediately.</div>

It's not the only one in that category of agro totems though, doesn't Searing also seem to get a lot of agro? (speaking from Leotheras/Noth experience)<br>
<br>
We also don't use totems at all. It's just not worth the risk when it's perfectly doable without them - P2 is almost entirely a position/tank "skill" thing, rather than totems making it easier (although there's always the argument of more DPS = less time to screw up in which is semi-valid).</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->It took me about 3 weeks to get a definitive answer from blizzard on this matter for our guild. In our case the last hit was from Maiev while dots where still on the boss and our raid dead.<br>
<br>
The final answer was that they cant reimburse, because they cant confirm the kill and it boiled down to "we are unable to help you".<br>
<br>
So either they are totally random in their decisions or the line is in between dead+last hit from a PC and dead+last hit from a NPC for their technical capabilities.<br>
<br>
A) We killed him and get the loot, with or without help of the NPC shouldnt matter as hes still dead and "our side" not, or<br>
B) We didnt kill him and the respawn bugged in which case it shouldnt make much trouble of respawning it (in that week or after a valid kill in another).<br>
<br>
This logical approach none of the GMs could or wanted to follow. Sad for that much money spent on customer service that is too restricted or not capable to do their job in my opinion.<br>
<br>
A pretty frustrating experience to get so close and loose even the respawn on top of the loot with time invested in the full clear of BT. I can only add to the advice of not pushing for a kill on the last % if theres a NPC involved. If it gets close, call a wipe on 2-3% rather.</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->This isn't entirely accurate.  I drop totems on P2 once the first add dies, and I drop them as close as I can to the remaining add.  NEVER have those totems been charged or killed, though every single week somebody yells "OMG no totems!" in vent when I do it.  So, totems are fine as long as you drop them under those constraints.  It really helps to be able to get a Mana Tide down in Phase 2, particularly because Gurgthock hogs all the VT loving.<br>
<br>
edit: Shabadu, that's odd and doesn't match up at all with my experience.  Maybe it's Windfury Totem?  I tend to be in the Hunter group and dropping Grace of Air, so I have never used Windfury in that situation.</div>

		<div id="post_message_450118" class="post_message_underline">I always drop a 'full set' of totems just before the adds spawn, and have never seen them be charged (I do drop windfury). I have also seen a lone add (other was dead) chain charge a wrath of air / totem of wrath, (can't remember which) that was dropped after the first add died. <br>
<br>
However, fire resist totems placed after the mobs have spawned have also never been charged, and I am fairly sure we have never had a charge to a mana spring/tide either.<br>
<br>
Its easier to see on Teron or Hyjal trash that windfury and searing get destroyed by any rsts (oh how I love that wf totem imbue stays active for a few secs when the totem is gone, if I had to redrop the second it died I would have no gcds for anything else on Teron). <br>
<br>
Anyway, to get to a point, it seems to me atleast certain totems are 'safe' (fire res for example) and can be dropped at any time in the raid area and not get charged, some are 'unsafe' (wf) and will be charged if they 'do something', hence why a redrop gets destroyed while a predrop lives. <br>
<br>
Does that sound sensible? Would a rogue clicking off the wf buff, that was granted from a predrop be enough to get the totem charged? (assuming here that since wf totem refreshes the imbue before it fades it would normally not generate a noticed action except when dropped, in the same way you don't 'gain' an effect like flurry if it refreshes while active).<br>
<br>
I can try testing the wf click off idea on out next kill, place the totem somewhere it can't get the raid wiped if charged (not sure they would approve though).<br>
<br>
<br>
And to the other topic of loot gain, quite a while back on Teron we managed to wipe at 1%, he reset and cleared all debuffs, but before he regained any health he was hit by a ghost (the first option on the pet bar) and died. We were told as no player caused his death, and infact no player was even on his aggro list we could not be awarded any loot. They refused to respawn him (as he was dead, they could confirm that) we were able to go to mother (who we were learning at the time) which required his death, but we couldn't get loot. It just seems to be a feature of the system that if the cause of death can't be proved to be your raid (which in aurora's case it was) then you will not get loot.</div>

</div>We are dealing with the same problem right now.  We cleared the first 4 bosses within our first week of being in Black Temple, but in order to continue moving at a decent pace in BT and Hyjal we are needing to Recruit people.  Our server has one other guild that has killed Vashj, so our Recruit pool is VERY small, and we were required to head back into SSC and TK to get them Attuned, which didn't go so well for a couple reasons.  Having to teach 4-5 new people an encounter they have never seen, plus the fact that most of our Raiders were obviously unhappy about being in SSC and TK when we should be making progress in BT and Hyjal.  Either way, hopefully after this round of Recruits is attuned we can move on and continue in BT and Hyjal.</div>

		<div id="post_message_452848">Agreed this is an irritating issue.<br>
Its not simply the fact of attunement, but in Hyjal &amp; BT the tailoring gear (which most priests, mages, locs will have) becomes a real liability, so you need to gear them up atleast a little, and certain classes (holy priests) still really need the 2x T5 bonus to help out on mana issues and other bonuses etc.<br>
<br>
So thats 2 incentives to go there... for new people, and the older members who have almost everything from those instances really loose interest in going.. except if their item drops.. which ofcourse will most likely go to them and not the new recruit that has to be geared up... prolonging the process yet another week.<br>
This is especially annoying in guilds which have a lacking of one token drop, especially on Defender - where you will most likely still have alot of Druids &amp; Priests with an unholy passion to finally get those few key items (mostly the chest..) which tanks always got before, and making them pass it when its among the best for the slot untill Illidan... unlikely <br>
<br>
Most of us groan when its announced SSC or TK, and the runs are never really that good or focused and it becomes a downward spiral from there, sad </div>

Greetings -------,<br>
<br>
Thank you for contacting the World of Warcraft Game Master Department.<br>
<br>
Issue Reported: We just experienced a very ugly and bad bug on Illidan.<br>
<br>
He transitioned between normal and demon phase during phase 3. During his animation, Maiev showed up and started the script to begin phase 4. However, when the script ended, he was completely bugged and ran around melee'ing people for 100k in demon form.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The issue reported above is not considered to be "broken" and should be functioning normally. If you feel that the functionality should be different, then please visit the Suggestion Forum (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304034844/http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/board.html?forumId=11122&amp;sid=1" target="_blank">WoW Forums -&gt; WoW Suggestions</a>) and post a suggestion.

</div>Yea not saying that its a hard thing to get around. We've never encountered that specific bug before so we did not know what to expect. It's just annoying when a "last attempt" is going so well then this happens and we have to put another day of raiding in.  I was looking forward to a free Saturday (not raiding but I'd prob spend all my time on Wow anyway!)</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">As a hotfix-style-thing they could certainly implement a drop (like the old scroll systems). Something like fragments that drop off each boss, and after 5 fragments you can bind them into an attunement key, rather than a "complete" attunement off the end boss.</div>

</div>I think flagging for an instance should have the following options:<br>
1) regular quest (kill kael + vashj for hyjal, for example)<br>
or<br>
2) Gurg's suggested 80% rule - you can go into the dungeon without an attunement if 80% of the raid is keyed.<br>
3) Something like Dukes suggests above - a way to complete your personal flag for the dungeon just by being in it for a suitable amount of time. 5 kill fragments = attunement, or perhaps rep equivalent to two or three full clears would be suitable.<br>
<br>
Putting the backflag scroll on the last boss helps guilds who have completed the dungeon, but doesn't help guilds breaking into the new content. As folk have pointed out, as you start getting into the dungeon your recruitment needs become really painful because you have to stop progress to go back a tier and attune folk. For guilds with 6 raid nights a week that's not so bad, but a 3-4 raid group completely halts all progress to key someone.</div>

</div>Illidan always does one ability after coming out of the trap it seems.  I've seen Shear, a melee (lolz dps warrior got 1 shot) flame burst, and I've seen draw soul.  I think I also saw him draw soul and then enrage and 1 shot a rogue once.<br>
<br>
Generally it seems if no one is in melee range nothing bad happens, only draw soul can possibly be bad if no one is in melee and that seems pretty rare as the one action.</div>

</div>Indeed there is strangly a small void when it comes to information about this one boss, I know everyone says that once you see it a few times you know everything, but sometimes its nice to know beforehand for (specificly raid leaders) to atleast gather some basic information while working... pre-plan a base strategy and such.<br>
<br>
The only other thing I know of beside that said above is the Priest with a shield making her basicly invulnerable and its not up all the time (however its up alot...) and when not its best to nuker her as shes quite weak. However as I've never been at the encounter dont take this as a fact untill other people inform you who have been there <br>
<br>
re: Darkkazul<br>
Its not at being hand-fed the tactic, however basic knowledge of the abilities is very useful to work out our 'own' strategy which can be modified from then, it saves 30-45mins of working out/explaining the new tatcic mid-raid and all </div>

		<!-- message -->
		<div id="post_message_453313">A couple tips on Council that will save you a number of wipes.<br>
<br>
1.) Have the mage spellsteal every time he can (thanks to Gurgthock I think for this one)<br>
<br>
2.) The pull...have you mage tank do the initial pull from the very very left side, all the way at the left wall. You can get to just below the lip of the stairs before aggroing. You can have him test this by having everyone else stay outside the room while he inches up to see where agro pulls. They leash outside the door so the raid will be safe.<br>
<br>
3.) Mage initiates agro by running in at full speed spamming spellsteal. Once he's got the buff he can fire blast for agro and PoM pyro if he's arcane. We had druids tanking the rogue, so they snagged agro immediately with moonfire. We had misdirects for the paladin and priest. Some of them will get very close to smacking your mage but as long as the other pullers know what they're doing he won't get hit. It is important that your mage is running in to get that spellsteal off. Until you get it down you will have many pulls where the mage falls over dead in the first 3 seconds of the pull either due to not spellstealing in time or the others not getting picked up in time.<br>
<br>
4.) The rogue. This isn't confirmed but our druids we had tanking the rogue said he would always reappear within 10-15 yards of where he was before he dissapeared. At first we thought it could be anywhere which lead to them not always being positioned well to pick him up quickly.<br>
<br>
5.) The mage has a melee range activated arcane explosion exactly like Capernian or the caster Twin Emperor. We didn't realize this until about an hour in because no one actually went up next to the mage until then. In retrospect it's something we could have probably assumed, but no one said we're smart.<br>
<br>
<br>
The rest of the fight is relatively simple. Positioning doesn't have to be precise, there is usually not huge burst damage except on the Paladin tank who we used 3 healers on. People need to be aware and not stand in the AoE, and help keep themselves alive but that should be second nature if you've gotten to this point.<br>
<br>
Interrupts need to be coordinated. What worked for us is a rogue and the warrior tank doing interrupts when spell immune and then a resto shaman (sometimes elemental shaman) as well as two mages for melee immune. Shaman attempts to interrupt every heal, mages alternate interrupts on heals as a backup in case of resists. It's very easy to interrupt as the spell cast is slow as hell. Just have your caster interrupters set up focus macros for it and have them not be completely retarded.<br>
<br>
The difficulty of the encounter is mainly in the endurance part, which ultimately means the fight isn't all that difficult for any guild capable of reaching it. The few gotchas for us were the initial pull, setting up a good interrupt team, getting everyone used to avoiding the specific types of damage going out and living, and healers getting used to healing it. We also had the learning curve for some the aforementioned things as well as some other small details. This is the same for most fights with no complete strategy guide written out because you usually can't ascertain a lot of the small details from a video.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">3.) Mage initiates agro by running in at full speed spamming spellsteal. Once he's got the buff he can fire blast for agro and PoM pyro if he's arcane.

</div>Bopping the mage just before he runs in saves a hell of a lot of time and effort getting correct positioning. He'll never get gibbed by the other adds as they just ignore the mage (well, the paladin and the rogue will at least, I'm not certain about the priest), but he'll get full agro on the mage mob and be able to deal with it fine. It also helps a lot if they're frost spec so they can have ice barrier on with cooldown ready to soak up some damage if something bad happens. It's not like they have a disadvantage from being frost for shahraz/illidan anyway.<br>
<br>
Another thing that helps is to make sure no-one jumps. It's a hard thing to do for people like me who are used to just jumping constantly regardless of fight (trust me, it pains me to do shahraz and council without touching the jump key), but it seems the server calculates AoE effects when you're on the ground, so sometimes jumping out of consecration instead of running will make you take a tick or two when you shouldn't have.<br>
<br>
Having someone on shield duty for envenoms helps a bit too if you can spare it. A full stack + envenom is around 8-9k damage total, which means stam gear, healthstones, health pots (or nature/fire/frost, all help) and having some kind of awareness of where you are in the room in relation to who is assigned to it helps (if you have an assigned healer, which we have).</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">We had yesterday Illidan at 1% when trap ended, people did not stop DPS like normally when trap is about to end (so it will normally go to MT who will face the boss away from the raid when trap ends) to prevent the draw soul. Healed 12% which proved to be too much for us at that point. Fairly easy to avoid if you encounter that once, but the in my opinion Blizzard should fix the instant use of ability when trap ends. Really annoying "feature" when you are learning the fight.</div>

If it was only a Parasite or a Flame Crash or some melee swings, that would be okay.

				<div style="font-style:italic">Greetings -------,<br>
<br>
Thank you for contacting the World of Warcraft Game Master Department.<br>
<br>
Issue Reported: We just experienced a very ugly and bad bug on Illidan.<br>
<br>
He transitioned between normal and demon phase during phase 3. During his animation, Maiev showed up and started the script to begin phase 4. However, when the script ended, he was completely bugged and ran around melee'ing people for 100k in demon form.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The issue reported above is not considered to be "broken" and should be functioning normally. If you feel that the functionality should be different, then please visit the Suggestion Forum (WoW Forums -&gt; WoW Suggestions) and post a suggestion. These forums are regularly monitored by the World of Warcraft development team.</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->We had a nice one with Illidan too. Sadly I was not in the raid, so I am not 100% sure how/what happened. But I believe during his death animation the raid wiped, due to the demons I think. The WWS showed that he was shot down by players.<br>
The corpse despawned/wasn't lootable and the encounter did not reset. Blizzards answer was the usual 'sorry can't do anything, working as intended.'.<br>
So no loot, no encounter reset. Clearly working just like it should. #$^@#$^ idiots.</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->It's definitely not impossible for the tank to maintain agro, he's getting double damage from the Caged debuff as well. Our tank holds agro, and we still kill Illidan in two traps generally. The important thing is to have the melee back out a second or two early, I think, so that they don't pull agro because they're 5% higher than the tank.<br>
<br>
Kind of a stupid argument that it's impossible for the tank to hold agro because the whole raid is doing double damage. There's no enrage timer or anything, the only thing you wipe to is tank death or attrition at this point. If it's a clean kill, it's much smarter to hold back a little and risk killing him in one more trap. Pushing DPS and risking him run into the raid because sometimes he likes to kill people after traps seems like a really unnecessary risk.<br>
<br>
We've theorized that the reason Illidan sometimes gets casts off after being caged is because the traps are clicked early. He doesn't seem to cast stuff if you click the trap when he's standing on top of it, ready to trigger it.<br>
<br>
@ Wodahs: The debuff is called Caged: <a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?spell=40695" target="_blank">http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=40695</a> It's a debuff on Illidan, not a buff, so you wouldn't see it with detect magic.</div>

		<div id="post_message_454574" class="post_message_underline">Finally got Mother cowbag Shahraz down today, after fourteen hours of attempts and having a heartbreaking MT port wipe at 4% on the previous attempt.  I think the best thing to take away from that is that at least it might be semi repeatable with the tactic we finally settled on.  Maybe.  <br>
<br>
Such an odd fight though, there didn't seem to be any real learning 'curve', we just seemed to go from 'We're shite at this aren't we?' to 'Oh, she's dead'.<br>
<br>
Spent a couple of hours messing around with the Council, going from knowing very little of the fight to quite a bit in quite a short time.  The one part that I didn't quite get my head around (I got plonked on mage healing so was a bit out of the action) is the Deadly Poison/Envenom malarkey.<br>
<br>
Am I right in thinking that the Demon Hunter vanishes, then Deadly Poisons someone in the raid, carries on stacking that and then Envenoms at X number of ticks (5?)?  So Shield them up and be ready for the Envenom?  Will he always reappear after an Envenom?</div>

After a minute, he vanishes.  He will DP someone.  The DP ticks a few times (4 iirc) and then he envenoms to remove it.  Then on to someone else.  After 30sec of this, he reappears.  Repeat.

Shahraz is very like pre-nerf Gruul, you think you're terrible at it until pretty much everyone gets used to the FA ports (or shatter, in gruul's case). As soon as everyone does, it suddenly pulls together and gets a lot easier. It's a case of practice more than anything, which means stacking stamina and using a lot of healthstones/shadow pots/bandages will help when you start learning as people might actually survive bad ports rather than just falling over and then giving up.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Agreed that Illidan using one special for 150% damage when the trap fades is stupid.  If it was only a Parasite or a Flame Crash or some melee swings, that would be okay.  As is, an Agonizing Flames for 150% damage is quite difficult to survive even as a healer, since you're taking those final ticks for ~7k at the same time as you're eating fireball volleys in his demon phase.  And a Draw Soul....well, you can't position to prevent that, seeing as it's impossible for a tank to maintain aggro during the stunned/trapped interval.  We've been lucky enough not to have that happen, but it still shouldn't be a possibility.</div>

They should do something about it, if its a too-fast-trap-activation issue, then its our fault, but I doubt it, I think that trap is counted from the moment he gets the debuff, not from the moment its clicked. <br>
If its a bug, then Blizz should fairly easily fix it, by simple putting something between trap and metamorphosis. Either make it another ability that has 100% to be performed, like "Mark of Illidan" on a random target which would be 10 minutes debuff and would kill the person after that or w/e, something creative but not encounter-changing. Dice roll in this situation is so wrong, since if it rolls "Draw Soul", it may be really annoying</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">We had a pretty strange raiding week this far. Not sure if this has been posted about before but when we started the Shade of Akama fight last night we had a weird bug. After we talked with Akama we had a pretty long delay before anything happened and then one sorcerer and one defender spawned, no actual packs of the 3 adds though. Shortly after that the channelers just stopped what they were doing and Shade of Akama walked off and engaged Akama. The whole fight lasted like 1 minute and we killed 0 channelers.<br>
<br>
We also had Kael'thas just disapear on us upon performing his cinematic at 50%. He flew up and just poofed away into thin air.</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->We've had this happen on our first kill, no less. After asking around it turned out it's a semi common bug if you pull Akama with the correct timing (i.e. when the Channelers stop channeling for a moment, as sometimes happens after resets). Not sure how repeatable it is if one tried, but don't think anybody has the energy to care. Enjoy your free loot!</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->I don't see how this is any different than totems, or pets/demons summoned during P2.  Pets appear to be classified as players for mob-targetting purposes, and anything that enters combat after the Flames have spawned will almost immediately get charged.<br>
<br>
As has been mentioned several times, make sure that pets/totems are summoned/dropped before the phase starts, and you should be fine.<br>
<br>
Pretty crappy luck that the far Flame charged the dagger-proc-pet though :P  Typically the closest one will charge.<br>

		<div id="post_message_455267" class="post_message_underline">I could be wrong, but if you CoS (and stoneform? I need to pay attention :X) the DP from Veras on council, he will usually envenom you straight away instead.<br>
<br>
Also, I know that DP ticks a max of 5 ticks, so he will usually envenom at the 4th tick so it won't run out. I also recall him doing it earlier sometimes (2-3?).<br>
<br>
As for Illidan, we drop totems too and just deal with the charges. Haven't gotten any enrages from it, and if the breath on raid after totem charging thing has a small chance of happening, I haven't seen it. I usually see them charge a totem and kill it, and even if they breath, it somehow lands on me, not on the raid. The charges are kinda nice too imo. If I move him too far out of the circle from melee, he usually repositions himselves nicely after a charge so the melee can beat on him again without fear of standing in the demon fire.</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->A lot of the mechanics are just the same things we've seen but different versions of them.<br>
<br>
The traps are Ossirian, you've got a mob that's enraged, bring it to this thing, click it, it's not going to kill your tank now, and it's taking more damage.<br>
<br>
Parasites are like you said, rsts gtfo.  Parasites in both phases are the part that seems the newest.<br>
<br>
Both flame crash and blaze in stage 2 is very much like grobbulus for tanking, move out of the aoe that gets dropped at your feet and don't get boxed in.  The blaze is just sped up with a more limited space.<br>
<br>
Fireballs are Onyxia.<br>
<br>
Eye laser is dark glare (but less deadly)<br>
<br>
Shear functions like a fear without fear ward but you have to do less to counteract it.<br>
<br>
Forced positioning on the Flames is twin emps positioning.<br>
<br>
<br>
There are new mechanics, the parasites and shadow demons are both pretty new, I can't say I've seen something quite like draw soul that I remember.  Just from a personal tank point of view a lot seems redone, I don't get to participate in the parasites at all, so for me it's a fearing grobbulus who enrages like Ossirian =\<br>
<br>
<br>
Edit: That said, I like the fight, I had just hoped that for being Illidan he'd have way cooler new mechanics.</div>

The parasite is seen exactly in alcatraz with incubate.  <br>

There isn't really anything original in any of the final 3 fights in Black temple.  <br>
Basically teron and reliquary are the ones that really are unique.<br>
<br>
I'd still say Kael'thas is the defining encounter of TBC.  It is very, very original - and is the hardest fight to learn in TBC due to pacing mechanics, and strategery (although that might've changed with knowledge of the fight being rampant, but wowjutsu shows it is THE severe block to many guilds).  <br>
<br>
Kael has zero gravity, legendary weapons with crazy effects - multi-stage stacking elements with timers - and an introduction to a few new key abilities... with completely novel methods of execution that doesn't boil down to "spread out" - heal shit, tank shit.</div>

<br>
If Kael was in BT (the fight, not the lore) then people would be drooling over it even more than they are now. "Better than Naxx" might even been thrown around. The fact that it's in TK sorta takes away some of the epicness after the first few kills.</div>

1) regular quest (kill kael + vashj for hyjal, for example)<br>

3) Something like Dukes suggests above - a way to complete your personal flag for the dungeon just by being in it for a suitable amount of time. 5 kill fragments = attunement, or perhaps rep equivalent to two or three full clears would be suitable.<br>
<br>
Putting the backflag scroll on the last boss helps guilds who have completed the dungeon, but doesn't help guilds breaking into the new content. As folk have pointed out, as you start getting into the dungeon your recruitment needs become really painful because you have to stop progress to go back a tier and attune folk. For guilds with 6 raid nights a week that's not so bad, but a 3-4 raid group completely halts all progress to key someone.</div>

<br>
In some ways this is even better as it gives you a chance to see trial members without actually giving them the keys that make them look like members of a high-end guild (i.e. so you don't kick them and they don't go trying to get recruited cross-server above their observed playing caliber).</div>

Hunters / Moonkin made sure they are debuffed for -hit% and I think some warlock even popped voidy at start for the -hit% debuff. The other tank (warrior in nature res gear) tanked both the elementals without problems and we burned them down as soon as possible. The two naga mobs were sapped and after sap broke, then trapped (cause generals cannot remove sap / trap, but can remove hibernate / banish).

<br>
We just agreed a non DKP system where one person gathers up all of the BoE drops and at the end of a run, we all had one /roll.  We just worked our way down the rolls, with people picking what they'd like from the haul.  It worked out a treat.  If you were lucky, you took away a free gem to use or sell (for exorbitant amounts of cash, obviously), if you weren't quite so lucky then there were usually enough Illidari tokens to cover most people.  A free flask isn't to be sniffed at for half an hours work!<br>
<br>
We did this over two weekends, running almost every half an hour until we had more than enough HoDs.  We were never short of people to make the runs, funnily enough.</div>

</div>Not exactly.  It's every couple of seconds, the game balances out the health between the 4 mobs.  It's easy to see when we do it, because we have all 4 mobs showing on the MT windows, so Gathios and Zerevor might be at 5% while the other two are at 6%.. then suddenly they all jump up to 6% when the game "evens" the health out since it's linked.  I think it rounds up in some situations there, it doesn't seem to be a perfect evening sometimes.</div>

		<div id="post_message_462908">As to trash farming, we've had most luck with the Gurtogg trash. Cleared with as low as 11 people on weekends, though I'd recommend around 15 for the 8packs.<br>
You can get by with some crazy group makeups (cleared with a single tank was probably the hardest).<br>
<br>
I'd recommend 2 good tanks, 2 mages as a minimum unless you've got a fair amount of experience with the packs. On the big 8-pulls sheep both the blade fury guys because they're by far the most dangerous. Use any CC you might have sap/trap/fear all work really well, and tank the remaining mobs. <br>
<br>
The other tricky pull with low numbers is the spectator packs - typically we have a holy pally tank up with consecrate for the little guys and one tank each on the big guys. Sometimes if we're slow he has to bubble off the healing debuff. The spectator packs are worth almost 100 rep each.<br>
<br>
<br>
As for loot, we track raiding upgrades the same way we do during regular scheduled raids, just to avoid stupid loot inversion problems (e.g. people letting valid upgrades rot during raids so they can pick them up during trash farming for free, etc).<br>
Tokens and Hearts go to the bank for redistribution as usual, and gems are /roll for need as a little incentive for folk to farm hearts for the guild.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Not exactly.  It's every couple of seconds, the game balances out the health between the 4 mobs.  It's easy to see when we do it, because we have all 4 mobs showing on the MT windows, so Gathios and Zerevor might be at 5% while the other two are at 6%.. then suddenly they all jump up to 6% when the game "evens" the health out since it's linked.  I think it rounds up in some situations there, it doesn't seem to be a perfect evening sometimes.</div>

</div>Ah, really? We just assumed that one of Gathios' judgements was a Seal of Light type thing, and caused him to heal himself for some small amount which becomes significant over the fight. Never could find anything in any logs to confirm this though, always thought it was wierd.</div>

</div>If you are reffering to the massive caster wave on I believe its Azgalor trash, we just let the NPC's take the initial burst then MT goes in.  Although, I am sure a shield wall/run in, or a rogue with CLoS would have the same effect, I still think NPC's are the safest.  Also, make sure your shamans are dropping groundings.<br>
<br>
In reguards to your FAPs question, our tanks only use them on Azgalor, and its only the tanks who off tank the Doomguards.</div>

We had our one PvP-specced warrior tank both Sisters, while DPS proceeded cautiously.  It wasn't that bad.  The only things that ever wiped us were actually the AoE zerg packs.  If you don't interrupt the first couple of MCs immediately, with that few people, things quickly can spiral out of control.</div>

</div>We have a feral druid swap from DPS to tank gear to lower his HP, HoT himself, and then faerie-fire pull, and run back. Thus he gets a bit of aggro on everything in the pack. A grounding totem in his group will usually absorb the first round of projectiles. This should give mages/priests/locks enough time to sheep/shackle/fear most of the necros and banshees, and the remaining ones shouldn't be too hard to heal through before they're picked up by other tanks.<br>
<br>
Also, regarding farming hearts:<br>
<br>
The first pack of Supremus trash is rediculously easy to farm. It consists of 1 commander and 5 workers (or is it 6? I forgot). A hunter can pull the commander and 1 worker and kite them back towards the entrance while everyone else kills the remaining workers. If its pulled right, the commander should enrage the worker that the hunter is also kiting (since he's the closest), so that shouldn't be a problem. Once the workers are dead, the hunter FDs and the mobs evade out and reset. <br>
<br>
The reason why you kite a worker along with the commander is that the workers won't respawn if you kill them all.<br>
<br>
You can do this with 4-5 people easily. Ideally you'd have a hunter to kite, a bear or DPS warrior to "tank", a healer, and a warlock to DPS and summon the hunter back once the workers are dead and the pack has reset. Any additional DPS makes it go faster. With this setup you reset the pack every 90 seconds or less, which is pretty good considering how few people are required. It's also pretty good gold since it's only split ~5 ways.<br>
<br>
The main problem with this is that it requires you to just kill Naj'entus and leave the rest of the instance alone until you're done farming, which might not fit well into some guilds raiding schedules. We would kill Naj first and then hit up Hyjal and SSC/TK until Friday and Saturday (our offdays) when we would farm the pre-Supremus trash, and spend Sunday and Monday in BT. However, now that we're further progressed in BT, this doesn't really work anymore, but guilds who have recently started BT and Hyjal might want to adopt something similar if they want to get a head start on hearts.</div>

Other times we just let the waves hit the gimps at the front and CC as they make their way up to us.

Has anyone found some cool trick in who or what to send in as the first person on the Shadowy Necromancer heavy packs?<br>

I don't think our tanks need faps, which mobs require them? Kazrogal I usually freedom the tank while he gathers up Thrall and the Tauren, then re-might him.</div>

You know what? When I posted that I wasn't even 100% sure, and I didn't yet read the replies to my post there until now. So I remembered just now, as I'm eating dinner during Shahraz trash, and asked the warlocks to try and banish. And you can't. Then I thought to my post;<br>
<br>
"Fuck, I look like an idiot, I must be getting flamed.."<br>
<br>
And then I see noone was even 100% sure here either!<br>
<br>
So yeah, you can't banish them, we're just bad and the 25 of us are playing at such a low attention span that we let our tanks die to the sister pulls a lot. </div>

You got lucky.<br>
<br>
The fight is roughly 50% skill, 50% luck.<br>
<br>
First, the luck:  FA ports on tanks can lead to insta gib of tanks.  FA Ports on the melee can lead to insta gibs of melee.  FA ports on the raid can lead to insta gibs for casters.  In addition, bad ports can lead to people not being able to seperate quick enough and lead to a lot of damage which leads to deaths.  Also, the randomness of mana burn and lash can lead to wipes.<br>
<br>
The skill part...  Eventually your raid will get better at handling FA in all aspects. People will seperate faster, people will learn how to use pots and consumables to save their ass in bad FA ports.  <br>
<br>
However, occasions where you will still question the fight mechanics when you get multiple FA ports on your raid (melee clump or caster clumps).  While you may not lose anyone, the strain it puts on your healer mana is enormous. <br>
<br>
Our kill last week had 2 consecutive ports on the caster clump, while not direct ports onto them, they were close enough that at 80%, all of our healers were already taxed for mana because of the mass amount of healing we had to do for those 2 ports.  We decided to just wipe it and go again because we knew we would face mana issues late in the fight.<br>
<br>
It probably worked out for the best, next pull we killed her.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Anyway, the fight is getting retuned at least, so hopefully we won't have to put up with this bullshit for much longer.</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->Tank gibs caused by FA seem to be less common than most people complaining about the fight would have you believe. Sure, it can happen if you get bad resist rolls and a spike from Shahraz, but most of the time the death is preventable through good timer use from the tank and healers being on the ball (big purple explosions near the tank = spam/pop instants). I'm sure a good number of complaints about "unavoidable deaths" were caused by pure player error like a priest popping a shadowfiend from the front and causing a parry-gib, people just don't always look for some more subtle things so they don't identify the real cause. <br>
<br>
Same thing with separating on FA. I've not seen a single port that caused unavoidable death aside from getting ported inside a bench where you literally cannot get away in time. Even if you're stuck between a wall and the raid/tank with a triple port, 1 person standing still and 2 running opposite directions is healable; "cannot get away in time" is an exaggeration the vast majority of the time. Most deaths that occurred when people separated correctly were caused by people not being properly topped off in the caster camp prior to the FA. We solved that by reassigning healers (resto shms in particular).<br>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->Mana really wasn't an issue on any attempts either (and by not an issue, I mean we didn't ever wipe because healers ran out of mana once we had healing assignments and group composition adjusted), even with large FA raid damage, and I doubt we've been lucky on mana burns every single attempt. Make sure healers are chain mana potting and not wasting pot cooldowns on shadow protection. Also, looking through WWS's for Shahraz, most shadow priests are SEVERELY under performing in terms of mana returned from VT (and damage output in general), even when the WWS shows them taking little damage from FA. Make sure chain heal spammers have your top-performing shadow priest.</div>

If it is even possible it is too much.  Having something like this happen with a lash, sinister, triple FA with bad resists on the tank under 10% is one way to make your night sparkle with happiness.  <br>

</div>
<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->A sinister/FA can lead to an unavoidable death - period.  The fact that you have no seen this almost astonishes me, or makes me think you just forgot.  You can pop an HS, pot and still easily be dead before the fourth pulse.  35000 resistable damage in 2.0 seconds is not skill.  <br>
<br>
The skill aspect of this fight is totally overblown.  We're very good at this fight and we can still readily wipe on any pull (I would say the 1 in 3 to 1 in 2 shot touted by celebrity earlier is about right - do the math on how that can turn out, plenty of 1 shots, plenty of pain) - we've tried numerous strategies and none make shit bit of difference.  <br>
<br>
I think group composition determines your success more than anything, and paradoxically more casters ends up being better often times because with too many melee the melee camp becomes a huge clump of 12 people that acts like "1 camp" anyway, increasing your chances of a painful port.  <br>
<br>
We typically survive ports on the raid, but coupled with a vile/sinister you're going to almost certainly lose 1 or 2 people.  But lately what wipes us is when we'll get 3 MT healers ported inside the couch, or on the MT, followed by some retarded beam - or a set of what feels like infinite wicked beams.  <br>
<br>
The problem is the way resist mechanics work in this game.  <br>
Tank deaths are rarely an issue, everyone thinks because I bring it up we have some abnormally high level of tank deaths, we don't, but it is still an issue.  <br>
You sure as hell can get instagibbed in full SR and T6 in the remaining spots, even with constant heals and AH (I've tried 200 through 365 SR, mid 200's has worked best for me).  Even if it only happens once every 2-3 weeks, its still stupid as can be.  People can surely do simple math here and prove to themselves it is readily possible without parries - add those parries in, and golly-gee, wonder what is going to happen - how the fuck is skill going to make up for that?  4000 sinister (50%), 9000 FA (50%), 7500 lash (33%), one paired hit (6,500, 3,500) and you're dead.  Now add a parry in there, maybe add an offtank being ported, maybe some poor resists - in theory you can get numbers that are just absurd, so the chances of a more common and lethal combination happening are certainly there.  <br>
<br>
One opinion (that I've heard repeated numerous times) is that the problem with this fight is FA being put in a random spot.  <br>
Wouldn't this fight be simply better if FA was sent to one consistent and relative location?  Wouldn't that have all the difficulty elements the devs appeared to have designed? and all the difficulty elements in a 1 camp strategy when they get lucky?  Wouldn't it remove many port problems, or unavoidable death situations?  Why does fatal attraction hit other members of the raid anyway?  As the DnT poster said in a previous thread, FA's behavior almost appears bugged.  <br>
<br>
The problem here is the way they've basically taken 10 random abilities and mashed them all together in a soup and called it a winning encounter with little-to-no testing.  This fight takes about as much skill as running away from the raid on grobbulus when you turn bright green.  I'm sure grobbulus would be considered "hard" if the person running away did 10,000 NR damage per second.  But the fight would still be dumb.  <br>
<br>
Also having two offtanks sit there and pick their ass all day is such a good example of how terrible this fight is.  Yeah you can have two paladins come in there and OT - but how many guilds are realistically going to do this... and many this would be the only fight they're using an OT paladin for.  If you have this option, fantastic, but you're still looking at a prot paladin, in full SR, getting silenced about 15% at random, casting heals.  Its dumb.  <br>
<br>
This fight should be nuked from orbit, just like Gruul 1.0.  After 7 or 8 kills of Mother Shahraz my opinion on her hasn't changed at all.  And for that matter Illdari could use some serious tweaking.  Its too long, too boring, too simple, and mostly too easy.  Last time we wiped on Illdari I think it was because someone fell asleep.  You can figure out if I'm joking.</div>

They should change the mechanics of it.<br>
That it dies damage first and for example 2xdamage as manadrain. This way you can get partial resists and +spelldamage would help to increase it too (for priests).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Yes, it also targets totems and pets.  From what I understand any time you don't have 3 people ported it targetted something that it couldn't port as one of the targets.  Snake traps (and extra shaman) drastically increase the number of unportable targets.<br>
<br>
I had read the Mother Shahraz thread before we attempted her and after a full night with 1 shaman we never saw anything except 3 ports, yet the thread kept talking about 1-2 ports.  After further investigation it became apparent that those people posting had far more shaman than we did, hence the easier teleports occuring.  With this in mind I told the hunters to drop snake traps and instantly we had a ton of 1-2 ports and the 3-ports became the rarities.<br>
<br>
Also snake traps eat Mother's beams which is also pretty nice.  In summary snake traps &gt; Mother.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I completely agree that the extreme combos need to be removed, but I think their frequency really does not justify the amount of complaints. My post was in response to a guy claiming the fight was FIFTY percent luck. I dont buy that. After she's patched there will probably still be some changes that need to be made to eliminate some of these, but I'm pretty confident that they will minor in the grand scheme of things. She will be a lot easier.<br>
<br>
Maybe I'm more patient than a lot of people but I realize that you can't expect perfection from the start, even with good QA, and you can't hotfix everything. I am willing to accept that there will be an occasional bullshit wipe if it's a known issue with a scheduled fix unless it's just ridiculously common. It sucks for the minority that honestly does get screwed repeatedly, but at least you can leash her easily until its fixed.  I'm pretty pleased with the encounter quality in BT/Hyjal as a whole. It could have been better but I wasn't disappointed.<br>

</div>Huh? Correct me if I'm wrong on any of this, but 3xFA is 9000 dps until you get out of range (3k per player applied every 1 second), and sinister beam is 2000. So assuming you throw in the sinister beam anywhere, it's t=1: 11000, t=2: 20000, t=3: 29000, t=4: 38000 all resistable. It's not very nice, but I don't see how that's a guaranteed death. I'd consider it roughly acceptable to expect you to get a heal from an outside source or break the link within 3-4 seconds if you get bad luck. Sprint/blink allow the link to be broken very quickly and many classes have additional survival tools at their disposal, so you'd also have to get unlucky on the classes ported. The fight is certainly not well tuned in its current implementation, but we know a patch is coming with pretty major changes. I'm not saying it's entirely skill based, but good enough player performance makes her "good enough till patch". She's not broken enough to warrant the increased development costs of releasing a mini-patch to fix her.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_469089 intelliTXT"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->If he means a sinister on someone who got FA'd (and not on the tanks), it will often lead to a death. Sinister only does 2000 damage upon being hit, but the impact from landing afterwards does half your health. A sinister being thrown in immediately before or after an FA is *probably* going to kill you. We've had people live through them before but it's the least avoidable death in the encounter frankly (except, of course, being ported inside objects).<br>
<br>
After having done the fight quite a few times now, I'd say that I think it's extremely, extremely hard, and frankly probably too hard. We still usually kill her in less than 3 pulls every week, but one week we wiped on her for a day and a half. Very stupid design and all that. But to be honest, it really is the only truly hard fight in the the tier 6 dungeons, and BT / Hyjal are going to be pretty easy after Shahraz gets smashed with the nerf bat next patch.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>That's something that I've really become curious about as of late. How much more difficult would we consider BT / Hyjal if we hadn't first had to get past the Kael'Thelas and to a lesser extent Lady Vashj encounters? I'm of the mind that once you've beaten Kael, you've essentially completed the most difficult encounter in the game in terms of ramping up guild performance and accountability of every player. Obviously as your guild moves on, the encounter loses a lot of its shine and mystique in the face of players simply out-gearing the zone, but for it's place in the progression tree it's really an incredible encounter.<br>
<br>
Is it all a matter of relativity? Would the BT / Hyjal encounters seem more epic if we never had to learn and experience Kael?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_469172 intelliTXT"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Difficulty is a question of perception, and perception is always relative.  So yes, they'd seem like a bigger deal.  Kael'thas and Vashj really ensure that no guild without a very solid level of performance, analytical approach to DPS, great coordination etc. will even see T6-level encounters.  In addition, a lot of the difficulty in the marquee encounters throughout the history of WoW raiding has come from new mechanics, new elements of fights that you'd never seen before and had to master to progress.  That's not really the case in TBC...most of the difficult fights in BT rely on heavy raid damage and a couple elements you've already seen and mastered to get to that point (interrupts, personal survival, that kind of thing).  Hell, even the Doomfires on Archimonde are fundamentally the same as Ouro's quakes.  In terms of original mechanics, I'd say Shahraz is the most unique fight in T6 (perhaps why she's so difficult to learn, though there are some stupid elements that have already been covered at great length).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">If he means a sinister on someone who got FA'd (and not on the tanks), it will often lead to a death. Sinister only does 2000 damage upon being hit, but the impact from landing afterwards does half your health. A sinister being thrown in immediately before or after an FA is *probably* going to kill you. We've had people live through them before but it's the least avoidable death in the encounter frankly (except, of course, being ported inside objects).</div>

</div>I thought that's what he meant but that wouldn't be 35000 resistable damage in 2 seconds, unless you can resist fall damage now. Even assuming the toss, many classes have the ability to deal with it. Slow fall, levitate, ice block, blink, safe fall, cat form safe fall, intervene/intercept, divine shield, and blessing of protection all prevent or greatly mitigate fall damage. That leaves hunter, warlock, and shaman. If you're not one of those classes it's not really an issue.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
And I'm pretty sure your math is wrong.  FA starts effectively at time 0 due to the way it applies and teleports, and lag/reaction.  You get afflicted by it just under 1 second before the first damage hits, but it seems to be ticking immediately upon porting.  So you've taken 18k resistible in the first 1.0 seconds - which was another issue brought up regarding the ability.  <br>
<br>
Its 27k + 8k.  Pretty straightforward.<br>
<br>
The sinful beam can 25% for over half your health at the same moment you've been FA teleported.<br>
<br>
Also you say that you don't buy that the fight is fifty percent luck.  What?  The fight is practically 100% luck.  She can single and double teleport all night, and a guild that has never seen her could one shot her with the right luck.  Likewise a guild with 10 kills under their belt could wipe on a pull where she chain wicked beams, sinful/FAs, or ports the MT healers into furniture or onto the MT/melee over and over with low resists.  <br>
<br>
This fight is nothing but luck.  Even when you master if you have about a 1 in 2 (at best) and probably more like a 1 in 3 chance of winning, even if you play perfectly.  So yeah you can ultimately improve to some decent chance, but you still run a more-than-reasonable chance of wiping.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_469318 intelliTXT"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->To Exigent, that's an interesting question, but I'm sure it varies from guild to guild.  The hard parts of Kael I think came pretty easy to us, figuring out orders and handling the advisers easily, figuring out Pyroblasts after I think the first night when we had one wipe to the pyroblasts.  Most of our wipes were to someone getting themselves killed and leaving us short on damage, so personally I'm more influenced by hard Naxx fights than Kael'thas as I never found him that hard.<br>
<br>
<br>
As for Shahraz, I think as you do the fight more you see the problems more.  On our first kill I thought it'd be easily repeatable, since we went from having OT's attacking and getting owned over and over again by parries, to stopping that and having a ~10% wipe and then a kill in the next 2 attempts.  Anyone who's killed her once is likely to have a similar bias, because it feels like everything fell together.  Then when she's on farm status and you still go "whoops tank got insta gibbed" "Whoops that FA was awful" that it just bothers you.  Yes a lot of wipes are still from someone doing something wrong, but a 3 port to a semi bad spot can still lead to a death just from bad resists, and it gets very annoying.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Incidentally after accumulating over 100k melee hits, HS hits, and SS hits over my character and pachwa's data from WWS, I'm reasonably convinced weapn skill is totally broken for parries.<br>

The default parry against a boss should be 5.6%?<br>

I'm getting 10% almost exactly with 360 weapon skill, plus or minus a standard deviation of under 0.8% per fight.  <br>

I'm starting to check non weapon skill tanks today - but it almost feels as if weapon skill is causing more parries, not less.  I've yet to see anyone under 5% parries on any meaningful sample set who has weapon skill.  <br>

I think perhaps the "blue" post that indicated the changes to weapon skill was straight up wrong.<br>

at 5.6% base parry vs a boss, with 10 weapon skill that should be a 6% parry reduction, 1% dodge reduction, 2% miss reduction.  I might buy the miss and dodge reduction, but not the parry.  However 5.6+6.0 sure matches the data better than 5.6-6.0.<br>

I would go as far as to say weapon skill is once again a terrible stat for a tank.  You are likely better off with the aggro-increasing set bonuses.  Unbelievable.</div>

Having 1 hunter drop a trap from behind really doesn't cause any additional parries other than when a mob flips around to do an RSTS which you get melee parries at that point anyway.</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->The number of whiners is also directly proportional to the number of people that like to blame bad luck because they can't figure out what went wrong.<br>
<br>
Sure this encounter has some problems, pretty much all of them will be gone with a single fix (Saber Lash buff applied even if it is avoided).<br>
So right now, maybe one in ten attempts at most, you will wipe because of air-lash, ported OTs or whatever else the result of a missing SL buff might be. That would make it 10% luck. Not 100%, 10%. Calling this encounter pure luck is just taking it a bit too far.<br>
<br>
Regarding parries, I have been under the impression that most non-caster bosses have a 10% parry rate now. They probably get another 0.6% or more because of the level difference. 0.6% parry reduction per skill point sounds a little too good to be true, but with 100k hit samples, you can probably figure it out.</div>

Many of the things you listed don't really wipe the raid. In most cases where they did, players probably made mistakes that lead to a wipe. I agree that this fight needs some tuning, it's just not as bad as some people make it sound. Furniture ports? Have yet to see any. (hint: we don't fight near the furniture)<br>
<br>
I for one don't want this fight to become the dull easy-mode farming mob that it will most likely be after all those 'fixes'. But I guess looking for a slight challenge in WoW might be asking too much. Anyways, the loudest voices will prevail.</div>

		<div id="post_message_470868" class="post_message_underline" style="min-height: 183px;">I assure you far more people want to see Shahraz fixed than those who do not.  This goes beyond the loudest voices here.  <br>
<br>
On our first pull last night our tanks started with their backs turned, and both got ported, with an instant saber lash after that.  <br>
<br>
On the next pull 3 MT healers got ported and sinful beamed.  <br>
<br>
You've got multiple combat logs on this thread which isn't even about MS showing deaths in 0.1 seconds.  <br>
<br>
You've got tanks wedging themselves into stupid positions cause of the bugs.  <br>
They're not doing this just to prove a point - they want to not die.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Everyone here wants a challenging fight - what we don't want is a fight that places many elements out of our control.  In terms of difficulty - I enjoyed all of the hard fights in Naxxramas, which incidentally were much harder than the fights in BT, and yet they didn't rely on randomness to get it done.  <br>
<br>
Do you really think people want Shahraz nerfed because we don't like difficult encounters?  Maybe the loudest voices are the ones who can skip on their own image and perhaps ego and say what needs to be said about basically broken and stupid encounter.  Did Gruul 1.0 seem appropriate to you?  Perhaps Hydross 1.0?  I have no reservations about speaking my mind about what I consider a terrible encounter.  <br>
<br>
I likewise also would be more than happy if they could find a way to make encounters harder without relying on the random number generator.  You know as well as I do that no two shahraz attempts are the same - especially over the long term.  The difficulty between two specific pulls can be enormously different.  Yet, reliquary and Illidan seem to keep the formula far more consistent without taking a hodgepodge of abilities and potentially creating disaster in 10 ways.  <br>
<br>
Shahraz and Illdari council sums up a few of the mistakes of TBC raiding (simplification).  They're both essentially "dodge this" encounters with a myriad of abilities.  If you slightly downtweak shahraz's abilities it becomes a much simpler encounter.  If you slightly uptweak the damage on the Illdari council's abilities you're definitely going to get unavoidable deaths with a much more difficult encounter.  Yet the player skill remains consistent, and the encounter is not better for it.  This is a terrible way to make an encounter hard - similar to adding fear on a fight like Archimonde, remove player control and call it done.  Archimonde is more than 1 shottable now - but it could be a MUCH better encounter if they made it more difficult through execution.  Remove the fear - add a second positional phase - add raining death - anything but a fear.  <br>
<br>
Compare the difficulty of 4H to Illdari council - the innovation in style and execution.  Illdari council is less interesting than Maulgar - and shows some of the brain drain that pervades this expansion.  People are desperate for a hard encounter and will even latch onto Mother Shahraz I suppose to keep one.</div>

		<div id="post_message_470885" class="post_message_underline">You are right, no two Shahraz pulls are really the same. Which makes the whole thing a little more interesting while we wait for the next instance.<br>
You seem to read between the lines that I love this encounter because it is perfect and has no flaws. That is not the case. But I still prefer a few random elements over some of the 100% repetitive encounters. They are the same as last week, the week before and the 5 weeks before that. The challenge is for 25 people to not fall asleep and remember the 1-2 jobs they might have.<br>
Sure there are some exceptional encounters that are interesting beyond the second replay without relying on randomness, like Kael'Thas. A lot of stuff going on, different assignments for everyone, long fight, etc. But realistically, we won't see too many of those.<br>
<br>
Lastly, something about truly horrible encounters. Encounters that should indeed be eradicated from the game. For example Void Reaver or Shade of Akama. Akama at least has a good design idea behind it. These encounters are simply way too easy to be where they are. But nobody complains, these are free epics after all.</div>

		<div id="post_message_470892" class="post_message_underline">Eh, if you consider Void Reaver to come before SSC I wouldn't say he's too easy. He's certainly harder than Gruul. He's easier than Magtheridon (his DPS requirement is probably higher, I think, but there isn't the whole 15 things to coordinate at once aspect going on) so maybe that's a touch off, but how hard should he be? Harder than Lurker? Morogrim? Leo?<br>
<br>
He should probably be switched with Al'ar in placement though (first boss in the instance being the one you do first).<br>
<br>
(I won't speak for Akama though as I haven't fought him and it does sound like early BT versus Vashj and Kael are somewhat out of whack.)<br>
<br>
Every encounter becomes so much easier once you've beaten it a few times that I don't really see how they can make encounters that stay hard without those encounters being either ridiculously frustrating to get a first kill on or ridiculously random (in which case you can be treated to either a cakewalk or RNG says you lose, depending on the day). I would like to see some more originality though, hard as that is to come up with at this stage (Gothik and Four Horsemen, though I got to experience neither, both sound like amazing and elegant encounters with their unique mechanics, for example).</div>

So that's 8 pulls to kill her over the last 6 weeks combined.  We spend an average of 10 minutes on the fight weekly, if that.<br>
<br>
Yes, the fight can be hard, and it can be exhilarating to deal with things like multiple ports on the raid, repeated 3-ports of MT healers into bad spots or onto the melee, or into corners, etc.  Our kill yesterday had 11 deaths total including a couple of brezzes, but we still killed her in one pull.<br>
<br>
That doesn't mean that fucking casters is excusable, or that it's ultimately good design to have people potentially instantly killed through no fault of their own.  Yeah, if it doesn't happen to your MT, you can manage to kill her anyway.  But it's still not good design that a corner port and bad resists, or a 3-port + Sinful Beam can pretty much kill you instantly.  It's certainly not good design that mages, shadow priests, elemental shamans, affliction warlocks, etc., do less damage than the tank sometimes.  That can't be changed soon enough.<br>
<br>
Yes, it'll make the fight "easier" but there are better ways for Blizzard to design a hard fight than the one employed with Shahraz.  I'd rather have a trivial boss than one that's frustratingly designed.</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->Grats on Kael.  If you can kill Kael you can kill Illidan.  Have fun.<br>
<br>
Shahraz is the major gear check -- nothing else is really too bad.  (I mean Naj'entus is a gear check too, but if you're killing Kael you by definition pretty much pass this check.)  RoS, Council, and Illidan are execution fights in terms of executing a predictable plan.  Shahraz and Archimonde are execution fights in terms of having your whole raid needing to adapt to dynamic situations.  <br>
<br>
But like I said, if you can kill Kael, you have the coordination necessary to beat the rest of the fights currently in the game.  Don't expect them to all just roll over and cough up loot, but you can do everything in there.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">We literally one-shot or two-shot (i.e., quick leash) Shahraz every week, and have done so since our third kill (took 7 hours of wipes for the first kill, 2 hours for the second, and smooth since then).  We're good at the fight and yeah, strategy and execution will get you past almost any "bad luck" event.  And I can't wait for the fight to be nerfed and neither can the rest of my raid group.<br>

So that's 8 pulls to kill her over the last 6 weeks combined.  We spend an average of 10 minutes on the fight weekly, if that.<br>
<br>
Yes, the fight can be hard, and it can be exhilarating to deal with things like multiple ports on the raid, repeated 3-ports of MT healers into bad spots or onto the melee, or into corners, etc.  Our kill yesterday had 11 deaths total including a couple of brezzes, but we still killed her in one pull.<br>
<br>
That doesn't mean that fucking casters is excusable, or that it's ultimately good design to have people potentially instantly killed through no fault of their own.  Yeah, if it doesn't happen to your MT, you can manage to kill her anyway.

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->Our experience with Mother has been pretty much the same. One-Twoshot (Hello Mr. MT port.) every week ever since we killed her. Still we stack the raid heavily with 6-7 melee and 9-10 healers. Also Rogues get spoiled with 2-4 bloodlusts. I don't know, the fight isn't hard in it's current incarnation just luck based at some points. (Also a awareness check. But you should have passed that with Kael'thas already.)<br>

Tonight mother hit the OTs with saber lash then the next saber she hit me for 25k. No one moved. Beams on the FA's is pretty lame. I've yet to see a parry streak kill me, although I imagine it will sometime. I've seen parry(6k) followed by a burst for 18k. Illidan has been the only one to turn and queued up a parry bomb. <br>
<br>
<br>
Using snakes sounds like a risk I'd rather not take. Tonight was 25% port on raid killing 8, the freak solo saber lash, and then kill. The luck factor isn't as big as some make it out to be, but there are some things that could and should be changed to make it less aggrivating. I will deal with the ports on the raid if she didn't port the OTs and didn't beam the ported players. Only seen a port on the raid maybe 2 times and only once have we had players stuck in furniture.</div>

<br>
I really can't wait for a few of the changes in particular, the parry gib will be nice to get rid of so I can have my offtanks attack.  It will be nice to get rid of the ports on the tanks (I think that the knock up is the same thing right?)  We had one wipe today at 22% when she threw me in the air and gibbed me after missing 2 lashes and dodging one, then our kill I parried a lash while I was in the air and was so relieved (it was at like 8%) and making casters not worthless will be good, we can't really stack our raids with melee, we bring a bit more than usual, but that means like 1 extra rogue, and I'm tired of out dpsing half the raid.</div>

		<div id="post_message_471043" class="post_message_underline">People saying the nerfs to Mother are too harsh, but the fight as is really is simple. All the changes are going to do is make the fight more fun for some classes and take away most of the randomness that can prevent even the best guilds from 1 shotting her.<br>
<br>
It's a gear check first off. This does not make the fight 'hard'. If you do not have the gear for her then that is your fault for not doing the fight as designed.<br>
<br>
We killed her within 1 night of attempts (about 3 hours) due to having the information here on forums like this and also playing around a bit finding what works for us. Since then we have 1-2 shot her every week. Yes we stack the raid, yes the fight is way too luck reliant.<br>
<br>
Even with that type of consistency I am looking forward to the changes so I can bring in the raid I use for 'Day 2 BT' to clear all the way to Illidan instead of doing alot of raid comp swapping after RoS dies.<br>

		<div id="post_message_471743" class="post_message_underline" style="min-height: 183px;">Raid stacking is terrible and any fight that requires you to stack your raid is poorly designed, we run pretty light on the healing side and we've been through fights with less than recommended healers and done them fine. Havent had a go at Gurtogg yet which everyone wants you to have 9-10 healers on, but we do Naj'entus with 7 healers and we've done Rage Winterchill with 5 healers. We put more weight on killing the boss before his gimmicks kill us and individual survival over stacking healers and make the kill take ages. <br>
<br>
Btw, PvP trinket removes the iceblock at Rage Winterchill, havent seen it mentioned anywhere. Pretty much trivializes that fight and reduces the healing requirement tremendously.</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->I am inclined to agree here.  One of my biggest gripes with WoW raiding is that bringing a "better" class combination for almost any fight makes it significantly easier.  I look back at my favorite fights in the game and ultimely the fights that didn't require stacking ended up being a lot more fun to me.<br>
<br>
While raid stacking may not be required to kill bosses, raid stacking is most certainly required if you want to come even close to being competitive with other guilds.<br>
<br>
The problem isn't an easy one to fix, however.  Blizzard wants to keep each class unique and have a particular function.  When a fight requires a classes particular function it will always be beneficial to bring more of that class.  The only real way to fix it is to give multiple counters to abilities so that most classes can contribute in a significant way.<br>
<br>
Despite its other flaws the Illidari council follows that model pretty well. Multiple classes can do interupts.  No one dps class is really that better than another.  The only area you are pigeon-holed is a mage tank and probably the warrior tank on the paladin (not that a druid can't do it, just nice to spell reflect for 7k!).<br>
<br>
Anyway back to the main topic.  Thanks for the tip on PvP trinkets on Rage.  I'm sad to say Rage is the hardest boss (casualty wise) in hyjal for us now.  We lose more people and have uglier kills on him every week I swear.</div>

Still by TBC standards 10 is most certainly stacking when once again nearly every fight can be done with 6-8.</div>

		<div id="post_message_471800" class="post_message_underline" style="min-height: 183px;">That's not the point. Pre BC raids were much less dps oriented, so yeah, 16 healers was a normal raid. Since BC, I suspect most raids run with 7-8 healers so yes, 10 can be considered stacking but is that really bad ? It just makes the fights easier, they're not impossible without stacking, just harder. We did gurtogg with 7 healers and 1 sp once, we did shahraz with 8, but these fights are indeed way easier with more healers so if you can do it, why not ? As long as nothing is really _IMPOSSIBLE_ without stacking (think 4hm), then it's ok for me.</div>

		<div id="post_message_471815" class="post_message_underline">Pre-TBC you also had a lot less hybridization of classes and roles that you see now (i.e. no Enhancement Shaman, no Feral Druids, etc.).<br>
<br>
So pre-TBC, with 8 classes and 40 people in a raid, you can expect (assuming a uniform distribution of classes) to have 5 players per class).  With 3 healing classes you'd then expect 15 healers, so 16 or 17 wouldn't be considered to be "stacking" too much.<br>
<br>
In TBC, what's changed is not the ratio of "healing" classes to "non-healing" classes (which is a higher ratio now, 4:9 as opposed to 3:8), but rather that the concept of a "healing" class has essentially disappeared.  You'd expect 2.44 of each class in a 25 man raid with a uniform distribution, but you longer expect all of those members of a "class with heals" to be necessarily in a healing role.<br>
<br>
So now, we tend to think of 7-8 healers as the norm, rather than the 9-10 that would be "expected" based on the ratio of "healing capable" classes to "non-healing capable" classes.</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->In my old guild we actually always had more trouble with an encounter when we brought MORE healers rather than less.<br>
<br>
We'd always do well on fights when we had healer numbers in the low teens (12-13ish) than when we brought 15+.  Nefarian?  Consistent one-shot with perfect control during phase 1 with low healer numbers, absolute mess when we added more.  Sartura?  Much less time for adds to roam around randomly whirlwinding into healers, killing them anyway.  Huhuran?  Much less duration of healing has to be sustained with more damage for the sub 30% phase.<br>
<br>
In fact, I think our cleanest C'Thun kill was the one we did when we had 8 healers in the raid, just because Giant Tentacles were dieing much faster, little ones were dieing quicker, and it also only took two vulnerabilities.<br>
<br>
I don't think preferring more DPS to healing is a new phenomenon in TBC.  I think it just depends largely on the style of the raid strategies your guild uses on each encounter.</div>

Burning him before the sons is simply not as good of an encounter as the guilds who went into phase 2.  But it had a little epeen attached to it I guess.  <br>

It was certainly epic to kill him with that level of execution.<br>

As to Juggernaut - like I said its about guild mentality.  Many guilds did prefer DPS over healing (most?), but ours definitely went for control.  Our 4 Horsemen kills were slow for instance.

<br>
Back in my very first guild (we were months behind, killed Rag after BWL came out)... our first Rag kill was with 3 waves of sons, with only seconds left until the 4th. As a holy priest at the time, I really didnt know much about the dps on the fight. Looking back at it now, I think the ranged might not of known they cant pull aggro or something. Tanks got knocked back almost every punt too.<br>
<br>
Fast forward a year or two, in an C'thun killing guild (just as Naxx came out). We brought way too many item-buyers to the raid, and we didnt have the dps to kill it before sons. We wiped around 3 times simply because we hadn't done sons in year(s), and we never did kill it.<br>
<br>
<br>
When I played a healer, I liked control. When I play a dps, I want a high dps raid. Mainly because I dont have control myself, so whatever makes it shorter reduces too many 'you loose' combos.<br>
<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Its funny that its just mentioned as I wanted to come here today and moan about the parry mechanics aswell, in this case on Teron. We killed him twice before but yesterday he just refused to go down (we had some 10-15% wipes which didnt end up with kill thanks to our incompetence, but thats different story). The frustrating part was that we had about 3-4 very nice going tries which ended up cause tank literally exploded after multiple parries from snakes (yes, he tried to avoid them hitting from sides / front). After that we used the snakes very carefully and on some tries not at all, however that didnt seem to help much. We still lost 2-3 good tries just on parries from melee when he turns on them to incinerate. <br>
<br>
Is there any way to reduce the chance of this happening on Teron except the obvious positioning ( camp ----- MT -- Teron -- Melee) or do we just have to hope for a semi-lucky try?</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->We were working on our second Teron kill when I read this, so we tried using snakes as well. The hunters tried to place them behind him, but it really didnt work- they all had around a 10% parry rate.<br>
<br>
It's not worth dealing with all those parries, just so a few shadow bolts (and incinerates?) get eaten.<br>
<br>
I really don't think your problem here is parries though. Hundred of guilds 1-shot this guy every week, and I doubt they are getting any luckier than you :p Improve your healing assignments, and possibly just bring more/better healers (we seem to have been doing fine with 7 tho).<br>

To me Shahraz and Archimonde are the most fun fights by far. The randomness of the fights is a good thing. It's fun that you suddenly can die and wipe. So what if you can wipe to no fault of your own due to bad luck? If the chance of that happening is small, which it is on Shahraz and Archimonde, it only adds to the encounter. The rest of the bosses become something you just farm real fast. <br>

As bad as they were I miss the impossible and untuned fights from before, Kael for example. It would be fun if there were heroic versions of BT and Hyjal. Or an impossible fight that you could see how far you could get.</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->Definately agree. There are no fights currently in tbc that took as long to learn as C'Thun (when he was killable), Nef (when you didnt know how to get to phase 2) and most of Naxxramas, that's one thing I really do miss. We know they can make hard 25 man fights because we've seen them, pre-nerf A'lar, Vashj, original Gruul even and many more before they got fixed or nerfed, the problem wasn't the difficulty of those fights (with a few tweaks that is), it was the difficulty compared to their placements in the raid progression order, if those fights were in BT or Hyjal there wouldn't have been the outcry those bosses recieved...maybe. Hyjal and BT are just far far too easy and it's just nowhere near as fun, still old A'lar is the fight I had most fun learning and killing.</div>

		<div id="post_message_472991">One thing that hasn't been mentioned in all this talk of whether to bring 5 healers or 10 is that the fact that not all healers are created equally.  Different healers go about the same job in different ways, and while one fight might lend itself to an army of shamans, another might favor the druids healing.  Most guilds can sub in "healers" for different fights, but not all have the option to sub in all the druids when it suits them, or all the priests when it works better that way.  Each guild does the best healing job with the healers they are accustomed to working with and if 5 of your healers can do the job of 10 then you are probably better off.</div>

</div>The Darkener had either Psychic Blow knockback or Shadowstep, which was more deadly.<br>
Sanguinar was the same, Astromancer had either Conflag and Firebolts or Voidzones and Shadowbolts, making it alot of fun to find out on the first attempt in a week!<br>
The Engineer had either the Remote Toy or he had a debuff he puts on his main target, silencing anyone that healed him for 5? sec. <br>
They still had the rest of the abilities and they kept their changing abilities for one week.<br>
<br>
Phase 2 was the same i think, phase 3 started earlier, something in the area of 45sec meaning you had at least 3-4 weapons still up when the advisors respawned, even with the best kind of potting.<br>
<br>
The really fucked up thing was that the Engineer had tons of initial aggro on the furthest away from him when he respawned, i dont think alot of guilds who tried Kael figured that out. It still meant he was most likely running into a part of the raid and bomb some people.<br>
<br>
Kael himself was doing the same, our guess in the beginning was that we had to offtank the advisors while killing Kael, because it seemed way too hard to kill them all in time even with dps stacking and the old kind of potting.<br>
<br>
Im also not sure if they changed any of the mobs hp, but what they really changed was the amount of time you have per phase and the Chromaggus style randomness per week. The Cosmic Infuser has also the 50% less damage effect on shadow spells, which was for Voidzone Astromancer, if anyone wondered about that.<br>
<br>
I would guess the fight in its old form wouldve been just impossible for 50% of the guilds who did him now and weeks if not months of delay for the rest.</div>

</div>Well, pre-2.0 when you brought a druid/paladin/priest/shaman every one of them was going to be healing. Now though you're looking at something like 1/3 to 1/2 of those will be filling some other role like DPS or tanking. So essentially you have to bring a lot more "healers" to have enough healing.</div>

		<div id="post_message_477175">When at the start of the Burning Crusade, we had to make a decision about the generic raid setup and ended up with assigning 8 slots to healers, 8 to melee and 8 to ranged with a 25th slot kept unassigned to tweak with. Mostly, that has worked out pretty well for us. I'm sure less healers and more DPS would have been better in the T5 content. But now, at the start of the T6 content, I'm happy we didn't do that. <br>
<br>
My main gripes are actually with two fights in specific. Vashj is so heavily in favour of ranged DPS that it isn't really funny, and very tank-unfriendly. And the Kael'Thas fight is just screaming to cut down to 6 healers. Now, had these two fights not had anything to do with attuning people I wouldn't mind at all, but Kael'Thas has proven a big bottleneck for our healers in particular. Where we have almost everyone else attuned by now, we still need 2 kills to get all healers past this step.<br>
<br>
For more generic fights, it's usually not a big deal to swap a few people around, that's easily done during the trash clear and doesn't cause complaints. We often swap a healer out for an extra AoE damage dealer on Solarian, to name an example. But this sort of thing shouldn't be part of the fights required for attunements.</div>

</div>This is silly.  <br>
<br>
No one is saying impossible.  They are saying stacking vastly improves your chances on nearly every boss in the game.  And they would be... correct.  I don't think we need to get the Mythbusters in here to verify this claim.  <br>
<br>
Vashj can be stacked to favor phase 2 groups - Kael to favor AE, or overtanking.  It doesn't have to be HEALERS!.  Hell Vashj is much simpler with a ton of shamans and warlocks (actually shamans are a recurring theme in a lot of stacking situations).  It is not by sheer coincidence that most guilds run 7 healers for Fight X, 9 for fight Y, and 6 for Fight Z.  <br>
<br>
You can kill Gurtogg with 6 healers apparently - but why the hell would you ever want to do that? Even as well designed as Kael'thas is, you will fare better using what your strategy considers an "ideal" group.  Its not as bad as 8 priest, 8 shaman, 10 mage, etc stacking in AQ40/Naxxramas, but its not like it suddenly doesn't exist (and stacking wasn't required for those old fights either incidently).  <br>
<br>
The path of least resistance is typically the best one [when it comes to saving time, morale, loot, lotto].</div>

</div>Just curious what other fights you would say strongly favor Shaman stacking?  I mean, on Vashj, having 2 for the MT group is very useful and I suppose Bloodlust for phase 3 is generally beneficial for dps but I don't know that we've seen any significant difference between doing the fight with a few or five Shaman... Bloodlust might be good in Phase 3, but I can't see that doing -too- much more than making up for the drop in totem utility in Phase 2.<br>
<br>
I'm hoping to take 5 shaman to Archimonde and I can see that making a big difference, and we're never sad to have our shaman, but Archimonde's the first fight we've gotten to where I've said to myself "we should stack shaman here."  Maybe I'm missing something?</div>

With that setup and some role switching you can pretty much do anything.<br>
<br>
Indeed shamans seem to be the key class for everything now. They have so many assets that just loading up your raid with one for each group grants dramatic returns. Totems, bloodlust, chain heal and pretty impressive single target healing when needed.<br>
It's also pretty neat to see 5 fire elementals up while AOE'ing weapons, they add a ton of damage there as well.</div>

4 mages or 3 mages 1 Ele shaman?<br>

<br>
<br>
You'ld be mad to turn down bringing any of them to raiding, especially MH/BT for various reasons (token slots for Enh/Ele, any healer spots for Resto), its essentially a +1 Tier of gear for their group which helps alot on learning and performing content your not completly geared for.<br>
<br>
<br>
We've been unlucky and never really had the option to field many good (or many at all) shamans, we've struggled getting more than 1 per raid.<br>
DPS-wise, we've generally had above average melee DPS, casters... generally ok, and healers again, on Alliance its hard to find many good Resto shamans for us (Horde simply have a years more experience) and we've been lucky on having mostly pretty good healers in general.<br>
<br>
You can get by in most content without them, but given the choice to bring in 4 shamans instead of 1-2? would do it in a heartbeat for anything except overfarmed content.</div>

Or a combat rez, like a druid? ^_^ Not to denigrate what Shamans bring to the table in any way, and we certainly do bring multiple Restos to raid most of the time, but aside from the poor Priest, who brings only himself or herself after you've got one in raid, I'd say that there are other things non-Shaman healers bring that make them equally attractive choices. Having, say, 3 Resto Druids in raid, +2 Ferals, as we did for a while, added a ton of forgiveness into Vashj and Kael that I don't think can be ignored. And on the nights we can only bring two Paladins, the general level of frustration people have about needing to forego one of their top three buffs is palpable (though I suppose we could leave them out of the stacking equation, since if we end up with 4 Paladins in raid for most things we will want to replace one if the option becomes available). <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
As far as the "added value + personal dps" equation, I certainly see your point, especially with regards to Enhancement Shaman, but I don't know that I agree with regards to Elemental Shaman. <br>
<br>
Certainly Elemental Shaman are hurt by the lack of upgrades in T5 instances, and from my perusal it seems that dps does begin increasing again as people make progress through BT/Hyjal... but I'm not sure that, given a chance to do it all over again, that I'd do it all the same and keep an Ele Shaman in the guild (i.e. that I would spec the way I have). I've seen several meters where Enhancement Shaman make the top 5, but few where Elemental do (aside from stuff where numbers are skewed, like Supremus). Not only that, Enhancement provides significantly more group benefit than Elemental does.</div>

<br>
While it is true that other healers provide good buffs (blessings/innervate+combat rez), you can keep adding shaman healers and their abilities are always useful. A fourth paladin is pretty much pointless. All the druid abilities are pretty much meaningless on stuff you can farm well. They are useful, sure, but they rarely make the difference between winning and losing, especially combat rezzes 3 4 and 5. This is not the case with shamans. You bring more shamans and things will just die faster, no conditions on it, no questions asked.</div>

</div>I would like to add a word in favour of protection paladins. We have one and 3 ferals, but would probably have prefered to have 2+2. With the current favour for zerg-style encounters (Morogrim, Solarian, 4/5th of Hyjal, BT trash..) we have come to depend heavily, too heavily probably, on our protection paladin. Nothing quite beats them for AoE threat building. Having a protection paladin also makes it easier to build those minimal healer groups, when you don't feel forced to bring 3 holy paladins for every raid.</div>

But this is more a question of how your raid setup has "grown" than about which is absolutely ideal. If you traditionally have two enhancement shamans in raid then you can easily justify their spot by the extra threat production. If you traditionally bring 3 resto shamans you can justify their spot by the utility and healing potential they bring.<br>

		<div id="post_message_477703">There's also a school of thought that sticking an enh shaman in a hunter group together with your feral druid can provide some reasonable performance upgrades. I haven't done enough theorycrafting to decide if it's more than sticking him in the tank group for WF, but when your hunters are consistently pushing your rogues, they deserve just as much love.<br>
<br>
As a gauge, our hunters are pushing 1000-1500 dps atm [depends on fight] (Kael down; starting on T6 content this weekend) while our rogues are doing 1050-1400 dps [again, depends on fight and buffs].<br>
<br>
Obviously the first enh shaman goes to the melee. You'd be stupid to not do it that way. But if you have two ... and you typically run with 3 hunters ... a group of:<br>
<br>
- enh shaman<br>
- BM hunter x2<br>
- survival hunter<br>
- feral druid<br>
<br>
is actually pretty kickass. All of the pets and the druid get the benefit of SoE and UR (which I believe *does* work for them?); the hunters and the druid get the benefit of GoA; the hunters get Mana Spring, which, while kinda weak, does help ... and the entire group can get a heroism. Hunters with heroism is fun -- we typically give two heroisms in the first phase of Solarian - one to our hunters, one to our rogues. They've earned that right through consistent dps output.<br>
<br>
But ... as Gurg mentioned ... giving an enh shaman to the tank group means all your tanks have SoE and WF ... which in the long run probably pushes their actual "dps" closer to 500 ... which pushes their TPS up above 900. Which increases the entire raid-wide dps by some quantifiable margin.<br>
<br>
Maybe play it by ear. Any fight your dps are riding the threat line, tanks get the shaman. Any other fight, the hunters do.</div>

</div>Well, my opinion is that the word "vastly" is a bit too much, or is used too much. Yes, some (let's say up to 5) fights in the game are really easier ou harder with some specific lineups but for the majority of raid bosses in BC, it's just wrong. Off course, things will be a bit easier or harder but don't tell me everything behaves like gurtogg with 6 healers vs gurtogg with 9.<br>

Hell Vashj is much simpler with a ton of shamans and warlocks (actually shamans are a recurring theme in a lot of stacking situations).  It is not by sheer coincidence that most guilds run 7 healers for Fight X, 9 for fight Y, and 6 for Fight Z.

</div>It's definitely not my opinion. I did kael'thas (and vashj) with very different composition (healer stacked, melee stacked, ae stacked...) and I didn't really feel it was SO easier with one versus others. Maybe it's just different for everyone, I don't know, but for example, many people claim that kael favors dps stacked raid and that you can bring 6 healers to make it easier. Well, we did kael once with 6 healers, it was one of our hardest kills to achieve (and it was a long long time after our first kill).<br>

</div>Off course. I'm not against raid stacking, we do it sometimes, my point was more to say that in most cases, raid stacking is comfort and guilds should not avoid fight X or Y just because they heard it's way easier with 8 healers and they have only 7. For 90% of raid bosses, the "easier" does not mean "insanely hard" without this 8th healer. Then again, you have some fights like archimonde, gurtogg, shahraz where it does effectively mean that. But they are the exceptions, not the rule.<br>
<br>
I'm just a bit tired to hear some stupid statements like "omg we need to completely change our guild roster between tier 5 and tier 6". That's just wrong. Maybe you'll need to recruit a healer if you did run tier 5 instances with 6, that's all.</div>

</div>For reference, we were taking 6 healers to most stuff in T5. Before we made our first serious push into BT/Hyjal, we recruited up and keyed so that we could bring 9 healers to fights if we needed to (based primarly on feedback from other guilds in this thread). <br>
I definitely don't regret taking the time do do that. <br>
<br>
And yes 6-&gt;9 healers marks a fairly significant shift in the raid roster.<br>
<br>
Yes, we don't put 9 in on every fight, but we do have them available when needed, and the difference is noticable enough that I wouldn't really want to do it otherwise.</div>

		<div id="post_message_478094">Well that's nice for you if you can find 3 good healers so easily, but that's still "comfort" in my book. I don't want to brag or something (excuse me if it feels like that, english isn't my native language) but what I just want to say to guilds beginning or near T6 is : if you can get 8-9 _good_ healers, then good for you, it will ease a bit some fights but if you can't, then just try the fights and play good, it will also work. We did not recruit anybody between t5 and t6, mostly because we didn't care so much about lineups, so we did full bt + hyjal with mostly 7 healers and 1 shaman only, and we killed archi + illidan in the top 20 euro or something. Off course, some fights were harder (gurtogg with 7 healers / 2 sp and archimonde with 1 shaman / no fear ward were not pretty) but we're very far from, say, 4 horsemen without 8 warriors or sapphiron with less than 6 priests.</div>

I said clearly matching the strategy - I didn't say less healers for Kael, or more.  From what I understand EJ ran 6 healers until BT/Hyjal, and then did indeed have to change their raid roster for T5/T6 (getting 3-4 more healers).  I suppose this could be wrong, but you do need more healers generally for BT/Hyjal.  <br>
<br>
We probably change 30% of our raid between Akama and Bloodboil - not because we have to, but because I value my time.</div>

I didn't mean to imply you were wrong or anything. Obviously the fights are possible - your guild is part of the proof of that. And nobody should let a non-ideal group stop them from trying the fights.<br>
<br>
Simply we found it easier to recruit a little before pushing BT/Hyjal - due to the possibility of making some fights easier, and anticipation of attrition with keying blocking recruitment.<br>
<br>
And yeah finding 3 good healers is certainly no easy task we were somewhat lucky and we really looked pretty hard to find them. If it were up to me I'd have recruited one more even - another shaman seeing as we're typically low on those. <br>
Our raid group isn't ideal either.<br>
<br>
As an anecdotal story, our first archimonde kill we took 4 shamans. Our second kill we only had 2. The difference was very noticable - and measurable too - we did almost 15% less dps over the entire fight just because people were feared longer and had to be more careful of the doomfires. <br>
Yes people played their top game, and we got the kill - but it was very definitely harder.<br>
<br>
The same seems true of many fights; healers for gurtogg, brez/soulstone and physical dps for teron, aoe (tanking and dps) for hyjal trash, etc. The ability to switch to an ideal (or closer to ideal) group on the fly will definitely speed your progress.<br>
<br>
<br>
I guess my point really was; yes it's doable with less, but if you have the opportunity to recruit up a little, it really does help a lot.</div>

		<div id="post_message_478135">Basically for most t5 content we ran with a roster of ~8 healers and fielded six for most raids.  4-5 of those 8 were 100% attendance, and the others were more like 60-70% so we were fine for all the t5 content.  But when we hit Gurtogg, Archimonde, and Shahraz, we really really wanted to be able to field 8 (or even more) and that meant having the stars align in terms of attendance.  We skipped Gurtogg for a couple of weeks after killing him because I thought first Hyjal and then RoS learning would be a better use of our raid time than trying Gurtogg with 6 healers.  We invited 2 shamans and a druid with very high activity, and now we have ~12 active healers and the flexibility we need.  We run with 7 healers as a default t6 composition, 9 for Gurtogg, Archimonde, and Council, and 10 for Shahraz.  Usually 8 for Illidan.</div>

</div>It's entirely possible that this is what bliz had in mind. However - as long as pure specs are significantly better than hybrids in an offspec role, it'll be optimal to simply swap in more pure classes or respec hybrids so that they aren't 'off'spec. As Sebudai said, respecs are pretty common. All of our hybrids have really good offspec gear and are totally willing to respec. Sometimes just for a fight or two.</div>

I must agree with Whiteknight on this... it is way too easy to sub out for a 'real' healer and you get substantially more benefit.  If they want fights that encourage Hybrid healing, they'll start implementing fights that require a high amount of healing in one part and low damage, and a high amount of damage with low healing in another part.</div>

</div>I know too well that people have no problem with sitting out and getting dkp, its just reading "10 healers" makes me feel uneasy, as I know it would be very unlikely to have enough raiding healers on that day when we needed them, end even more unlikely on weekly basis. To let people port to Orgrimmar to respec for a boss or two then port again to respec back every lockout, isn't too appealing either.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Lose a swiftmend on a druid, and earthshield on a shaman, and a bit of manaefficiency, (which can be helped with pot chugging), is than really so much of a difference in t6? Provided you already have an earthshield and a tree in your raid. We don't have nonholy palas and we wouldn't want to lose shadowpriest manabatterys.<br>

I know too well that people have no problem with sitting out and getting dkp, its just reading "10 healers" makes me feel uneasy, as I know it would be very unlikely to have enough raiding healers on that day when we needed them, end even more unlikely on weekly basis. To let people port to Orgrimmar to respec for a boss or two then port again to respec back every lockout, isn't too appealing either.<br>

I guess we'll see it when we see it....</div>

Who said you have to do Archimonde or Illidan with 10 healers? We definately don't use 10 healers. Not quite sure how many we use on Bloodboil, but its 8 I think.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I think sometimes that from reading these threads people hear the  word "benching" and conjure up these horrible images of being the last person left to be picked for dodgeball back in 5th grade P.E.  The truth is, most guild's class channels work out amongst themselves who will be going or not going and the opportunity to skip out on a raid now and then and still get DKP can be a welcome break.  I know I would much rather sit out a couple fights than be expected to respec and keep two sets of gear at an optimal state for raiding.</div>

</div>Yeah, exactly.  Many of our 100%-attendance raiders are quite happy to sit out and PvP, level an alt, or just alt-tab and do whatever else, and be available if needed.  When I say I want to drop 2 mages and add a shaman and a resto druid for Shahraz, I've said that ahead of time, and the players involved are the ones who decide who it'll be.  They either rotate informally or maybe only one person needs loot from that boss or whatever.  It really doesn't cause any problems at all.  I like to have 33-35 players around on any given raid night, and it really isn't a bad thing in any way.</div>

</div>We've been building our guild all the way through SSC/TK with this in mind.  Not only does it offer flexibility but it also give people a chance to take a break every so often without crippling the guild.  The real key is to make sure you aren't over saturating a given class.  Also letting the classes micro manage themselves is something that has made the my life and our other officers lives much much easier.  It promotes inner teamwork and takes any hostility off of me for letting raider x into more raids then raider y.  I just have to specify what classes I want for a fight and tell them to tell me who.</div>

</div>Sitting out nowadays isn't very painful anyways. I can make pretty good money farming spiders in Black Morass when sitting out of Hyjal and there are elementals of almost every flavor within a stone's throw of BT. This is nothing like sitting at my corpse for 4 hours at the AQ40 entrance if I was the last priest to login for a raid, and sometimes it's nice to save a few gold on consumables and just take it easy while still getting raid credit.</div>

		<div id="post_message_498003">Going to bump this thread for some general questions, please be kind. <br>
<br>
My guild has made the leap into T6, finally. Gotten our second Kael kill, starting to get extra people keyed for Hyjal/BT and all that wonderful logistical stuff.<br>
<br>
<br>
My questions are about Anatheron and BT trash:<br>
<br>
For Anatheron, we've cleared to him 3 times now. Gotten a fair grasp of the abilities, but still seem to be missing something I think. Our trouble seemed to be two-fold. We had 7 healers, 1 for the Infernal tank and 4 on MT and 2 raid healing. Trouble was the Carrion Swarm debuff lasts longer than the cooldown of the ability, so we had people getting hit twice in a row and getting killed since the healers on that side had the debuff. We tried to have the 6 healers spread out, in 3 groups of 2, each gorup 60% away form the other, so try and avoid too many healers getting debuffed, but we still seemed to have trouble getting the raid healed. Is there a better setup to use other than circling around him and is there a better way to setup the healing to deal with the Carrion debuff?<br>
<br>
<br>
Also, going to be making our first foray into BT soon, to check out the first few bosses there. Any tips for the trash? Specifically any nasty abilities or things to be warned about for the Najentus/Supremus trash. Trying to find out what I can before we head in.</div>

		<div id="post_message_498025">We had a problem like that early on.  Mark the healers and make sure they spread out in a circle AND make sure they stand fairly close to Anetheron.<br>
<br>
Healers by nature like to stand at maximum range of those they are healing.  The problem on this fight is, when group 3 gets hit by Carrion Swarm, the only healer in range also has the debuff, so he can't heal.  If the healers stay in a circle within 15 yards of Anetheron, they are in range of almost everyone.</div>

		<div id="post_message_498343">We treat Aneth positioning kind of like Ouro back in the day.  Triangle-based, so that at most a Swarm will only hit one group.  We do also have one single healer off behind the MT that can only get Swarmed if Aneth targets him or targets the MT (2/25 chance) so there's usually one person constantly healing the MT with full effectiveness.<br>
<br>
Clumping is key.  People in tight clumps ensures that if one clump gets targeted, only that clump gets hit.  People spreading out might bridge the gap between two clumps and get a dozen people Swarmed at the same time, which is bad.<br>
<br>
Make sure Swarm is reasonably distributed, and rotate misdirections on Infernals, and it's hard to go wrong.  (MD can be important -- having your Infernal tank get slept right as an Infernal lands can outright wipe you if not handled quickly.)</div>

		<div id="post_message_498356">There's only a few trash packs that are particularly worrisome in the Naj'entus parts of Black Temple. <br>
<br>
- The packs with generals can be handled a few ways, we just prefer dragging the generals over 100 yards away from the other mobs so they won't dispel crowd control on them. You can also just tank everything and kill the weaker mobs first I guess, though the raid damage taken could get nasty.<br>
- The double Aqueous Lords right before Naj'entus himself can hurt. We found killing one, cleaning up adds spawned, killing the second works best. If you have a tank with an NR gear set it works well for tanking these mobs too since it heavily reduces the damage your tank(s) will take.<br>
- The pack with a large amount of Aqueous Spawns directly after doing Naj'entus can be rather nasty as well due to high potential damage taken by the raid. Mostly a matter of good CC, spreading, and poison cleanse totems though.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">We treat Aneth positioning kind of like Ouro back in the day.  Triangle-based, so that at most a Swarm will only hit one group.  We do also have one single healer off behind the MT that can only get Swarmed if Aneth targets him or targets the MT (2/25 chance) so there's usually one person constantly healing the MT with full effectiveness.<br>
<br>
Clumping is key.  People in tight clumps ensures that if one clump gets targeted, only that clump gets hit.  People spreading out might bridge the gap between two clumps and get a dozen people Swarmed at the same time, which is bad.<br>
<br>
Make sure Swarm is reasonably distributed, and rotate misdirections on Infernals, and it's hard to go wrong.  (MD can be important -- having your Infernal tank get slept right as an Infernal lands can outright wipe you if not handled quickly.)</div>

</div>Well the idea is right, but we don't treat the fight like "Ouro" per se.  <br>
<br>
If you have an even spread as opposed to 3 clumps, you should take less damage overall.  He doesn't have a 120 degree arc to his swarm.  <br>
<br>
We also use SR on top of spreading out, and it trivializes what is otherwise a hard fight.  <br>
<br>
At this point I'd say azgalor is the hardest of the zone... but only due to his trash making the fight longer as a whole vs archimonde.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">We've just recently made it into BT/Hyjal and I was wondering if anyone had thoughts on a progression kill order between the two zones. I don't know first hand, but it seems like is some latitude in kill order past Supremus in BT and there is always the option of pushing in Hyjal, where 8 waves per attempt probably dampens the learning curve. What has your experience been so far?</div>

</div>my guild experienced that despite the waves in hyjal, there is still a very good progression. this is caused by the relatively easy boss encounters (in fact we spent more wipes learning the waves than the actual boss). We did 1-4 in Hyjal, then played the temple until shade of akama and finally spent trys on archimonde. I think especially the psyche needs some rest after kaelthas before you try the next hard endboss (archi), who can be very frustrating because you need many more pulls for him than for every other encounter beforehands (at least this was true for my guild).</div>

My questions are about Anatheron and BT trash:<br>
<br>
For Anatheron, we've cleared to him 3 times now. Gotten a fair grasp of the abilities, but still seem to be missing something I think. Our trouble seemed to be two-fold. We had 7 healers, 1 for the Infernal tank and 4 on MT and 2 raid healing. Trouble was the Carrion Swarm debuff lasts longer than the cooldown of the ability, so we had people getting hit twice in a row and getting killed</div>

</div>With almost all BT fights and a lot of MH fights, you need to start getting higher health on your clothies. All of our cloth folks were told to be able to at least get 10k life buffed. Since then, we have had very few deaths to 2x carrion swarms ont he same groups. Of course as you are new to MH, it may not be so easy to get the 10k life needed, but it makes a huge difference, plus will be very very useful for Najentus.<br>

</div>I agree. I hate fighting Azgalor far more than Archimonde, Archimonde even took 1 raid day less to down =). Azgalor's RoF should maybe tuned down a bit due to the sheer random nature of the Doom and the RoF being so strong really can mean luck decides if you win or lose. I really dislike fights with strong random factors in them, and Doom killing off your healers first is very very annoying and unpreventable in this fight. Maybe ore experienced guilds have less issues due to having more DPS and therefore less dooms. But to a new guild tot he fight, it is very harsh, especially with a 30minute trash clear for each attempt.<br>

</div>We did 1-3 MH then 1-3 in BT. The first 3 fights are relatively easy (Najentus being the toughest of the 1-3 BT fights oddly enough!) After we had the first 3 bosses on "farm" we then finished off MH. Though going 1-4 in both instances would also make sense. <br>
<br>
The loots from the first 4 bosses of each instance will go a LONG way to boost your raid hps up over the 10k buffed barrier which really makes a huge difference on many fights.</div>

		<div id="post_message_525198">So I'm a little ashamed to admit this, but we're running into trouble on Anetheron controlling his infernals.  We've had them skamper through ppl just carrioned and wipe 3-4 dps at a time.  We've had the infernal tank run out to get one, get carrioned and be oor of his healers (the closest raid healers to him being also carrioned).<br>
<br>
We set up the raid with 4 clusters essentially around him.  The melee spread around him.  The ranged dps at 3 points closest to where the infernal tank is and one MT healer alone on the far side-hopefully getting as few carrions as possible.  We have a second MT healer at one of the ranged spots and a raid healer at each of the 3 ranged dps spots.  The Infernal tank sits in front of Jaina with 2 dedicated healers further back.  As an infernal spawns the target starts running towards the tank.  Once the tank gets the infrnal - the ranged switches to the infernal until it's dead.<br>
<br>
We're handling the carrion wave fine.  The thing that has caused the wipes is always the infernal in one form or another.  Are people using hunter rotations to MD them to the tank quicker?   Are our ppl just too damn slow getting to the tank when they're targetted with inferno?  Tank too slow?  We seemed to do very well killing the other 'easy' T6 bosses and had a relatively quick time of kael-so wiping to Anetheron is making me go prematurely grey.</div>

		<div id="post_message_525330">Anetheron really does not require that complicated a strategy. Only the healers need to be spread out, because it doesn't matter how many ranged DPS gets hit. For the first couple of weeks I would spread them out specifically, but they just pick spots for themselves now. We've used 1-2 infernal tanks, but we've never had enough hunters to reliably MD, so they just pick them up by themselves. The Inferno cast time is plenty long for a tank to get near the target.<br>
<br>
I don't really know what to say if your Infernal tanks are having problems picking them up or running out of range of all healers. They really shouldn't have to move much at all once they pick up an infernal - the immolate range is very small and they can be easily tanked between the ranged and the melee. Have your tanks had experience picking up adds on other add control fights, such as Vashj?</div>

</div>Remember you dont even need hunters to always pull/misdirect infernals. The easiest way to pull an infernal is actually a mage/caster who takes off salvation and uses a mana pot immediately when it spawns. Make sure you will actually receive the full amount of mana restored when you use it - Thats alot of threat! (Of course you want to make sure your infernal ot can pull it of you as it comes, which shouldnt be hard - easily snarable while you kite it in those few seconds)<br>
<br>
We had some fun times using 'mage misdirects' the other day when our hunters died to pull infernals, and it was a fun change.</div>

</div>Whenever you use a mana pot/gem to regain mana - you gain threat on everything around you , alot of threat if you get 2-3k mana restored - thats common knowledge among good raiding casters. (Im always surprised by how many raiders dont seem to know this...)<br>
<br>
You can use it to your advantage on Anetheron to self-pull (if you dont have enough hunters) infernals towards the mage. In our strat, all the mages stand about 60 yards from the boss next to the Infernal offtank, so we pull it towards him and he picks it up.<br>
<br>
BTW - It doesnt have to be a mage (I only mentioned that because im one), any class who uses mana could self-pull mobs in this way.</div>

</div>Agreed.  In the last 2+ months I think we've wiped on Azgalor once - first 4 dooms were ALL healers.  Sure there's soulstones.. but one healer running away to die, one running back from res'ing and a crappy silence got us or something.  Either way... its a SUPER repeatable fight for us.  Archimonde we've 1-shot the last 2 weeks, but over the last 2 months we've averaged 6-8 attempts per week.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Remember you dont even need hunters to always pull/misdirect infernals. The easiest way to pull an infernal is actually a mage/caster who takes off salvation and uses a mana pot immediately when it spawns. Make sure you will actually receive the full amount of mana restored when you use it - Thats alot of threat! (Of course you want to make sure your infernal ot can pull it of you as it comes, which shouldnt be hard - easily snarable while you kite it in those few seconds)<br>
<br>
We had some fun times using 'mage misdirects' the other day when our hunters died to pull infernals, and it was a fun change.</div>

	</tbody></table>
</div>I agree that you don't need hunters but what you are describing is overly complicated.  We used to have a dedicated tanking position with misdirects, but I recently decided that tanking them near their spawn is quite viable.<br>
<br>
Try having your infernal tank (don't forget FR gear) stand in the middle of the raid waiting for the Infernal to cast.  When he begins the cast, have the tank move up next to the targeted player (but out of range of stun).  Once the infernal spawns the tank attacks and the nearby players adjust.  If it spawns on melee, the tank should obviously back it away a bit.<br>
<br>
The disadvantage of this strategy is that the ranged DPS will need to occasionally attack through Anetheron to reach the Infernal.  The advantage of this strategy is that you should never have an infernal running through your raid causing damage and potentially wasting DPS time.</div>

</div>Complicated? No way - What you described actually requires more effort , lets compare<br>
<br>
1 - Caster clicks mana pot to pull agro. Infernal immediately running directly towards caster waiting at the tank spot.<br>
2- Infernal tank stays in raid waiting for infernal. Infernal tank moves to targetted player. Nearby players move away from infernal spawn point. Tank picks up infernal in the raid, establishes agro, then attempts to drag the infernal through the drag to the tank location or tanks it at current location depending on guild strat.<br>
<br>
Granted, both have the same effective result - but the second method sounds more complicated to me. I dont think it makes sense to force multiple nearby players to 'adjust' to an infernal when you could simply move it immediately out of the raid and let the raid focus on more important things (keeping the tank alive/healing carrion swarm)</div>

</div>In your case, people still need to move away from the spawn point and the tank still needs to establish aggro.  I am not sure why you're listing that as a complication of my suggestion.  I also don't understand why you think picking up an infernal where it spawns is complicated. <br>
<br>
Using a mana pot to pull aggro seems inherently risky to me.  How much threat does it generate compared to healers?  What if the infernal has to run all the way across the raid?  What if it runs through the melee and they are using whirlwind/bladeflurry?  What if the mana pot timer is down?  Do you rotate the caster who uses it? <br>
<br>
Tanking it near it's spawn point means the warrior is on it quickly, definitively, and it's not going to run around for any reason.</div>

</div>Yes, depending on how many hunters there are. However I should add our strat for infernals is 4-5 ranged dps (2-3 mages/1spriest/1warlock) standing at 50+ yards the entire fight. They never are actually dps'ing anetheron, and therefore are never able to get carrion swarmed. We basically put the amount of dps that it takes to kill an infernal before the next one spawns - and keep those players separate from the raid.  Our reasoning for this is because it means there are less targets who can get carrion swarmed near the raid, reducing total carrion swarm damage done so the healers can focus more on your mt. Its still only a short ~5-6 minute fight either way. =)</div>

</div>Our main reason is, that the infernal dps group won't get damaged by a swarm (so won't need additional healing) and especially that the assigned offtank healers won't get the swarm debuff (which could result in a dead offtank quickly).<br>
<br>
Today we was running with three hunter for the infernal and it was pure luxury having an MD ready with every infernal spawn. Other ID's, we used one hunter with merciless gear to autoshot pull them off the raid.<br>
<br>
Other topic, was the illidari council nurfed in the days ago? We tried them on tuesday for the first tome at the end of our raiding week and managed to get them to 19% (enrage timer) on our last try with 2 early dps death and only three used heroism instead of six. With proper lineup and healers on fire, it seem's much to easy compared to fights like RoS or BB. From lurking here, i really thougt of a second epic (horrible) twin emps fight.</div>

It's not really "hard" in that there aren't sudden skill-checks that can wipe you, but it does require solid attention for ~10 minutes.  I don't know, some people say it's boring but as a healer it's actually probably the "hardest" fight in the zone in terms of demanding very rapid reactions from multiple people.  Helping with OT healing, healing the raid, tossing chain heals at the Gathios melee, NS'ing poisoned people who are soon to die, and earth shocking Malande's Divine Wraths, I have a more involved role there than on any other fight in the zone that I can think of.

		<div id="post_message_533679">I like the Illidari Council too, as a melee DPS there are so many "Oh shit!" moments that can kill me if I just even dare to blink an eye. Say that you move too slow out of Gathios' Consencration, so you take two ticks (really slow, but hey, just to give an example) and then you get a Flamestrike too. You can start kissing the floor, because that's where you'll be. <br>
<br>
I just have a soft spot for fights that continuously require movement, I've always loved fights such as Twin Emperors, Four Horsemen, Heigan, Thaddius, ... and I think I can add the Council to the list, as a melee DPS at least. The only part that is annoying is that I have to redrop totems if Gathios is kited a little too far away, but hey :P.<br>

Not to mention you can nuke pretty hard on them too. And being unfocused isn't going to let you just stroll through it either, one mistake at 10% and it can be over.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Illidari Council is a lot like Twin Emps.  It's not really "hard" in that there aren't sudden skill-checks that can wipe you, but it does require solid attention for ~10 minutes.  I don't know, some people say it's boring but as a healer it's actually probably the "hardest" fight in the zone in terms of demanding very rapid reactions from multiple people.  Helping with OT healing, healing the raid, tossing chain heals at the Gathios melee, NS'ing poisoned people who are soon to die, and earth shocking Malande's Divine Wraths, I have a more involved role there than on any other fight in the zone that I can think of.  It's more mana intensive than any other fight in the zone for me, as well.  I enjoy it.</div>

</div>As a resto druid it pretty much exemplifies the "topping the meters isn't necessarily fun" concept.  I stand still and rotate lifebloom through 3 targets for 10 minutes, moving/healthstoning if I happen to get an AoE on me.  It's definitely my least favorite fight in the zone, if not all of TBC.<br>
<br>
With Twin Emps everyone at least you alternated healing phases, and had to keep moving away from exploding bugs (if you spread out some healers on the floor).</div>

		<div id="post_message_534293">I really enjoy healing on Illidari Council as well.  I heal the Lady Malande tank, and whatever raid healing I can do when she isn't chain casting smites.  Usually healing anyone that happens to get deadly poison that's still in my range.  I enjoy the predictable damage, where you have to time a large heal to go off right after the damage.  That timing aspect of it all at least feels like a way for healers to distinguish themselves.<br>
<br>
My complaint about the fight though, and what it's missing compared to the twin emps, is the size and the grandeur.  Twin Emps had the giant eye when you walked into that huge room.  It was also a huge distance that  you had to keep them separated by.  If there had been a larger room, and a mechanic forcing the Council to be separated by a greater distance, it would have added a better feeling, and probably greater difficulty, since that type of mechanic stops a lot of the cross healing that happens.  If I could never get help healing my tank, or myself, then it would certainly be a more challenging encounter from my point of view at least.</div>

		<div id="post_message_534386">I definitely still like the Council encounter simply because I'm always the sole mage healer, and we tank the mage far away from everyone else.  If something happens to me or to the mage, it's 100% my fault, so I have to be paying attention.  I have to cover myself from Envenoms (sometimes multiple), Blizzards, and Flamestrikes, so I myself am usually pretty busy.  However, it's still one of the only fights I find myself sometimes zoning out in, and it may be because we're segregated from the rest of the group and I have only a vague idea of what's going on anywhere else.<br>
<br>
There are a few reasons I would say it's not like Twin Emps:<br>
<br>
The first has already been mentioned, where you have this HUGE room with two really big guys with a cool little script a a big eye when you first enter the room.  I remember when we beat Huhu, it was quite an experience walking in there for the first time, whereas the Council has nothing like that (more like, "Who are these guys and why are we fighting them?").  It was also no small feat getting through the Twin Emps trash for the first time. <br>
<br>
The second reason is because one of the coolest aspects of the Twin Emps encounter was that you had to constantly be switching things up due to their teleport.  The same thing for 4 Horsemen... the healers and DPS had to constantly move to a new area because of the debuff and fight someone new.  With Council, however, there are separate teams that do different things to handle a member of the Council, but that's all they do for the entire duration of the fight.  Everyone just kills Gathios, the interrupters on Malande just do their thing, the Mage tank and healer stay in their spot, and the Rogue tank chases him down most of the fight.<br>
<br>
I do like the fight, definitely.  I just don't think it's quite as cool or as challenging as 4 Horsemen or Twin Emps (especially since Twin Emps was the first time everyone saw this type of fight gimmick, so it was new and special then).  I guess what I'm trying to say is there's a difference between busy and interesting... Council keeps you busy, sure, but it doesn't do anything that's particularly interesting. =)</div>

</div>This seems like the rose colored glasses of nostalgia to me.  I remember doing Twin Emperors for the first time and it was extremely intense.  As a healer it required SO much focus for 15 minutes straight.  And the size of the room made it so that someone needed to keep tabs on the status of the two healing teams-- if two people on one side went down or out of mana, someone needed to be ready to swap sides.  But as we got more mileage with the fight, it just became a 15 minute fight of doing the same thing over and over.  It's not that different from Illidari council.  In fact, council is even more complicated, except for the potential of tank transitions.<br>
<br>
Now I'm not saying the fight is a borefest.  I like any fight where there are ample opportunities to screw things up, because it's an opportunity to do things well, and it's very satisfying to execute everything perfectly, or nearly so.  Fights like Archimonde, Illidan, Kael'Thas' and Vashj fit this description, as does Illidari Council.  I still find the fight a lot of fun.</div>

		<div id="post_message_535466">Council doesn't involve the extreme burst damage of the Twin Emperors on any of the tanks.  I mean, sometimes Gathios will land a big hit string while the DOT is ticking on the tank, but if a decent stream of heals are landing it's no problem...even while learning.  Unbalancing Strike was MASSIVE damage especially if you weren't using Demo Shout, the sort of damage where a tank could definitely get two-shotted and you wanted a Priest on PW:Shield duty full-time.  Council also lacks the spacing/threat components of the Twin Emps, and the DPS race feels easier to win.  I don't think it's nearly as intense, though I still enjoy it because I have a soft spot for healing/endurance fights.</div>

</div>This seems like a healer mistake to me.  You died 5 seconds after receiving the deadly poison debuff.  Our healers configured Grid to look for that debuff and one or two people are assigned to heal the afflicted people as soon as they get it.  Your first heal was a renew, 4 seconds in.  That renew should have been a shield, of course.  You took 15500 damage total.  Assuming you had 10k health buffed and the shield prevents 2k damage, you only needed 3500 in other heals to survive.  One potion and one healthstone at the 4 second mark would have done that.  Or another healer could have started casting a large heal 1 second after you were afflicted by deadly poison.  You would have been hurting, but you would have survived.<br>
<br>
I guess my point is that this was not an unavoidable, instant death situation.  It was really bad luck, but not a guaranteed death.  The encounter was providing the opportunity for people to make mistakes.</div>

</div>Lets say he was fully topped after the consecration and deadly poison ticks, that's still 10.2k damage delivered in 0.5 seconds. While there is a healer mistake in there, it is still a decent example of what can be so cruel about this fight. And it is for exactly those situations that I think this fight is so stupid. With so many envenoms, flamestrikes and blizzards going around and the time it takes to execute this fight ... yeah, not the best of combinations. <br>
<br>
I guess what the fight tries to push is an urgency on the healers to keep on top of the situation while the raid spreads out. Several people getting hit by flamestrike and blizzard, melee getting careless with consecration and so forth can quickly spell doom for your raid. So on two fronts its an endurance fight, the raid as a whole needs to navigate carefully while the healers battle to keep the raid alive.<br>
<br>
A side effect of all these abilities in the fight is that some of them will collide and have the very real potential to instagib someone. That's what I don't like about this fight, otherwise I very much like it. It's just sad that the fight needs to derive most of its difficulty from this aspect.</div>

		<div id="post_message_535529">It's very very rare that we have a death on Council where I can't immediately figure out what killed them and how it could have been prevented (usually with faster/more responsive healing).  With a healing-pressure fight Blizzard is usually banking on the inevitable trade-off between speed/throughput and efficiency.  Lots of people can take lots of damage at once (though they shouldn't if you maintain good spacing) and if you're efficient about it you run a serious risk of them dying...you can't just toss some HOTs and move on.  If there weren't so much raid-wide damage there wouldn't be much pressure on the healers, and the whole point is getting your healers to operate under pressure for a long time.<br>

		<div id="post_message_535578">There are definitely a few gib situations, but very rare, much more often is the death due to preventable but barely preventable kinds of things, usually it ends up being melee, but it's never fun when you get envenom on a melee, then you get a chain of Flame Strike, Consecrate, and Blizzard on top of people.<br>
<br>
The thing is, the fight is extremely forgiving for a few random deaths as well, the enrage timer is a non issue essentially, and if you've got a few combat rezzes, you can deal with a few healers dieing if you get them up quick.  I like the fight for the most part, but I get bored of it about halfway in every week because it's so long, and I just can't stand it if people decide to be dumb all night and we wipe a few times.</div>

</div>I didn't participate in the two hours of attempts we had on Council after our first Mother kill last week, but reviewing the WWS showed how evil the wrath can be when combined with any other damage.  I made the suggestion to have more interrupters on the Priest for this week's go at them so that both CoH and the Wrath are interrupted and hopefully minimize the gib situations more.</div>

<br>
One thing I'm curious about is healer setup. Bosskillers suggests 7 healers, with around 4 on the Gathios tank, but in practise we found this to be grossly different from our needs.<br>
<br>
Typically we take 9 healers to this fight, but we find we're pretty comfortable with just 2 resto shamans keeping the Gathios tank up. <br>
Probably we learned the fight with 9 because of not interrupting the wrath early on, but we keep this balance anyway.<br>
<br>
Are folk typically using ~7ish healers, or is ~9ish more common?</div>

</div>Yep so I hear. What a shame, there really seems to be a shortage of resto druids. We've been looking for a resto druid forever and when I check the guild recruitment forums to see what other guilds are in the market for, there are a ton of guilds that are looking for a resto druid also that have BT on farm. One of these days I guess. <br>
<br>
We sure as hell don't have a problem with healing in the guild, our healers are all awesome but my god rolling lifeblooms on multiple tanks like in Council really seems that it would make healing very 'stable' allowing other healers to toss some raid healing that would of otherwise been on the tanks full-time. <br>
<br>
Usually I'm on raid healing for council and I'm generally a good 15-20% ahead of next healer. Paladins are downright amazing raid healers for Council. The raid damage council puts out isn't very ideal for chain heal unless it's used into the meele on Gathios. Our strat focus on spreading the hell out so chain heal isnt the best to use. Most of the raid damage happens on 1-2 targets at a time hitting 1-2 targets for a ton of damage and holy paladins are really good at fast single target raid healing of this nature with aggressive holy light spam. Now only to get a 4th holy paladin to put light on the raid for me *drool*.</div>

<br>
We still use 9 healers though, but that's mostly because 9 is a good number to have throughout Gurt---&gt;Illidan. Actually gurtogg---&gt;Illidan is a very cohesive part of the zone, you need 3 tanks, 9 healers and 13 dps to do it give or take, depending on various guild strategies. It's convinient if you do that part at a different day than the first one.</div>

Right now my guild is working concurrently on Naj'entus and Anetheron, and a search revealed that some Anetheron strategy discussion had taken place in this thread. I'm the tank assigned to pick up infernals on that fight, and have had a couple problems that perhaps you folks might be able to give advice on. I'm aware of starting out each infernal with a misdirection, and hopefully we'll be trying that next time.<br>
<br>
1. What do you typically do if your infernal tank gets slept while tanking? On one occasion I was slept twice while tanking a single infernal, and each time the sleep effect seemed to be a temporary aggro drop - i.e. while I was asleep, the mob immediately went and starting hitting someone else, but as soon as I woke up it came back to me. <br>
<br>
2. What do you do if an NPC gets aggro on an infernal? On another occasion, it took me a couple seconds to scurry across the battlefield to an infernal location, and in the meantime it started whacking on an Alliance Rifleman. To my surprise, I could not pull aggro off him. I hit, mangled, and lacerated until that darn Rifleman died, and still did not get aggro, which surprised me, to say the least, since I usually have no problems grabbing and maintaining aggro on my targets. Is there something odd with NPCs and aggro, in which they seem to generate a good deal more than player characters? Or am I doing something wrong?<br>
<br>
Thank you for any advice!</div>

</div>People have to be aware of their surroundings and simply run away from the infernal if you're slept and they have healing agro. As for #2, I know my friend said she saves her rage when an infernal is nearly dead and unleash it on the next infernal. It's not really an issue if a NPC has it for a few seconds but you're guildys have to get away from it especially when you drag it over to your tanking spot</div>

		<div id="post_message_541110">Apologies if this was mentioned before in this (or some other, I wasnt really searching that thoroughly) thread but we tried bit of experimental approach on azgalor thrash yesterday and it was suprisingly great and made the thrash waves up to azgalor actually quite fun.<br>
<br>
Wave 1 and 2 were killed normally and on wave 3 we kited infernal through the whole troll camp in the back, then tauren camp (infernal died in process, we picked some other to continue the trip) and then back to the gate, where we finally gathered basically all npc's from the whole camp. One infernal got banished around 50% and we let all the npc's beat on it.<br>
The thing is, that the 5 (maybe 6) witch doctors from whole camp drop healing ward, which works both for your raid and the npc's as quite powerfull AOE heal. We just kept infernal or fel hound banished in every wave up to wave 8, cause the NPC's simply raped every single wave without a problem or some npc's dieing, cause the healing gained from the witch doctors wards is just quite insane (and not just on the npc's but on the raid aswell). They were able to quite effectively tank mobs (usually ended up around 50% when mob died and regened to full while waiting for a new wave).<br>
<br>
The witch doctors from the troll camp are aswell pretty awesome on Azgalor himself where they can almost manage to keep offtank for doomguards alive on their own (with bit of assistance of one healer maybe, if theres too many doomguards in the end).<br>
<br>
If you didnt try that yet, definetely give it a shot.</div>

</div>There wasnt any need to drink. Or rather, there was very minimal amount of damage that actually needed to be healed by something else than the healing wards.<br>
And mages just aoe'ed for a bit and locks could lifetap as much as they wanted thanks to totems. The massive pack of npc's already got quite insane dps especially if none of them is dieing, so mana as in effective healing / damage fuel wasnt really a problem.<br>
<br>
EDIT: Just as a warning, the npc's try to rush forward sometimes and leave the totems behind which can end up with you loosing pretty much all taurens and half of other npc's. So always try to help them with taunts / aggro / aoe / snares etc to park them right on top of the totems, so you can be sure all the npc's are getting heals.</div>

Just watch his patrol route closely and see where he is furthest away from the pack (which is pretty much at the end ouf his quartercircle turns when he walks away from the raid. I mispulled him only once and that was when I didn't know how close those two pulls are.</div>

</div>I've only seen it at the Horde camp, usually what you can do is when an infernal lands far away in the back near no mobs ... just let it be. That's the easiest way to do it. However, if you're clearing waves before the timer runs out anyway you will have just under 20 seconds to drink up for the next wave. <br>
<br>
I've found it to be a nice psychological effect for people, but I've never found it to be of any real use unless you are losing people.</div>

</div>This is not 100% true.  You can port into the instance after you kill Supremus, not after you kill Akama.  The only benefits of killing Akama first is free lewts and stopping the demon trash in that room from respawning (also makes the roaming broken guys friendly instead of kos).<br>
<br>
Technically, you have the choice of doing Akama, Teron, Gurtogg, or RoS.</div>

		<div id="post_message_548210"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I have another question. While we have little problems with encounters like Teron or Gurtogg, we seem to have found our nemesis in Anetheron. Yes, we kill him every week, but it often involves 2-3 wipes and the kills rarely look good.<br>
<br>
Our problem is dps not getting healed back up fast enough after a Carrion Swarm (was that the name?). How do you distribute your dps and healers? And how many healers do you assign to raidhealing there?<br>
<br>
Help is - as always - greatly appreciated.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_548241"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I've always been a fan of a triangle position on Anetheron, we don't use it - but it's something I came up with when my old guild was having problems.<br>
<br>
You basicly have Anetheron at any point of the camp, preferably with a long stretch of space right behind him. You then have 2 ranged groups at max range behind him, forming a triangle. Assign a couple of healers to stand at max range from those 2 groups to heal them. This way those healers will never (or rarely) take the hit from Carrion Swarm and can just happily heal away. And if they do get hit, the other raidhealers will just heal it for them. And you tank the infernals in between both ranged camps.<br>
It's a LOT like Ouro in that regard, if you ever did him.<br>
<br>
It's pretty hard to explain without a picture, so if you don't understand I could whip out a picture and have my awesome paint skills show.<br>
<br>
Edit: I knew Gurg had posted something similar before:<br>
<br>
<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px; ">
	<div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom:0px"><img src="assets/citation.gif" border="0"></div>
	<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" border="0" width="100%">
	<tbody><tr>
		<td class="alt2" style="border:1px inset">
			
				We treat Aneth positioning kind of like Ouro back in the day. Triangle-based, so that at most a Swarm will only hit one group. We do also have one single healer off behind the MT that can only get Swarmed if Aneth targets him or targets the MT (2/25 chance) so there's usually one person constantly healing the MT with full effectiveness.<br>
<br>
Clumping is key. People in tight clumps ensures that if one clump gets targeted, only that clump gets hit. People spreading out might bridge the gap between two clumps and get a dozen people Swarmed at the same time, which is bad.<br>
<br>
Make sure Swarm is reasonably distributed, and rotate misdirections on Infernals, and it's hard to go wrong. (MD can be important -- having your Infernal tank get slept right as an Infernal lands can outright wipe you if not handled quickly.)

</div>I don't understand how, Gurtogg is very random on who he decides to focus, but we 'one shotted' (in brackets because on the first pull our main tank wasn't sure where to tank him and tanked him OOR of healers) on our second kill ever, and our first kill only took something like 1.5 hours.<br>
<br>
We run very paladin heavy which is extremly nice for healing through felrage, but 8 healers and 2 shadowpriests makes him extremly trivial.  The key is just to dump a shitload of healing on the fel raged targets, and save the innervates for the holy priests healing their groups, as long as you use an intelligent trinket choice, each innervate will fill the holy priest to full mana.  As soon as someone gets fel rage, have all paladins chain cast highest rank HL on the target, they get absolutely insane mana regen since they are soaking up the fel-rages and getting mana back from spiritual attunement.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

We have all of our Mages, Warlocks and shadow Priests stand out of range for nearly the entire duration of the fight. There's no point in having ranged DPS eat swarms at all.

</div>Just use the strategy Gurg posted.<br>
<br>
Since you should have 1 full group of ranged dps on the Infernal full time, that leaves 4 groups to work with. Then you need the tank and healer for the Infernals. That leaves a group of 3 people. If you make that group consist of the MT, Paladin for Devo, Infernal Tank, Paladin for Fire Aura, and some other class to benefit the MT. You'll have the full melee group behind Anetheron + a healer or two, and if melee heavy them there too. Then the two healer groups in front of Antheron so that at any point during the fight, only one camp can get swarmed. Get Jaina invloved early, Infernals or Anetheron, don't matter, it helps. <br>
<br>
Once you get that down, its all based on the raid set-up for what healers you stick where in the clumps.<br>
<br>
Edit: It's assumed that the Infernal tank/healer/dps group are out of range of being slept, swarmed, and all that nasty crap. Get them far away and no troubles will ever occur from there except possible NPC screw ups with new infernals.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>She corrected you by clarifying that you can port after killing Supremus.  Our guild does this to save time.  After we kill Supremus, everyone uses their BT medallions, teleports outside, zones in, and uses the NPC to teleport back in.  <br>
<br>
Instead of killing two 6-packs of demons at the door behind supremus, you kill a roaming 3-pack of humanoids and 2 packs of rogues.  However, this is really only efficient if you have killed Illidan and have the neckpiece or already have your raid outside of the instance.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Right, forgot to mention this. Make sure your raid is prepared for either:<br>
- Not getting a pet bar (and thus the 'secondary action bar' keybindings not working)<br>
- Loosing your main action bar (and thus your /cast Spirit Lance, etc macros not working)<br>
<br>
We wiped 3 times before people realised they had to click. Didnt look much into who it affected, but it seemed pretty random (both people with and without barmods got the issue it seems)</div>

</div>Anetheron with 6 healers sounds painful. All the others, I concur: 6 is plenty for Akama, Supremus, and Rage; 7 is plenty for Naj and Teron.

I'm also curious as to how Anethron is handled with so few healers, we've taken no less than 8 on any of our kills, and whenever we attempted with with less, our healers were over-whelmed and we lost too many people.<br>
I can imagine however, it being possible with an extremely aware raid, but I wouldn't like to take chances on something like that.</div>

</div>We usually run with a 7 Healer Setup (mostly 3 Paladins, 2 Resto Shamans, 1 Priest, 1 Druid). We use 8 Healers for Teron and Najentus, 9 or 10 for Gurtogg. We did our first Archimonde Kill with 10 Healers due to the fact that no DPS class was available to fill in, I do plan with 9 healers for Archimonde.<br>
<br>
As we have not downed anything beyond Gurthogg I cannot tell you how many healers I would use there, but I currently plan with 8 or 9 for RoS.</div>

In the end, it's probably best to feel out what works for you. Some guilds prefer more DPS and less healers, some guilds prefer more healers and less DPS.

</div>9 on Najentus and 10 on Gurtogg/Sharhraz is really overdoing it. We did Gurtogg once with 11 healers and it was more painful than the usual 8 healer set up we use.<br>
<br>
Aside from Essence, everything is doable and probably optimal to have 8 healers in. a 9th wouldn't hurt on Gurtogg/Council and dropping to 7 helps some of the easier boss, but they're so easy it doesn't even matter. Our raids always include 8 healers with an elemental shaman healing on Gurtogg and Council. Completely eliminates the need to sub so many times during a night. We used to start with 7 until essence then 8 for the rest, but we outgear it now that our dps meets the required level even with 8 healers. <br>
<br>
For learning, though, it would make sense to change the setup per boss since the boss will take a few hours instead of the 10 minutes it takes for farming guilds. And I'd recomment 8 for Azgalor/Archimonde/Illidan/Naj'entus and 9 for Council/Gurtogg/Shahraz. 7 for the rest.</div>

</div>I think we use an unconventional approach on this encounter. As someone mentioned we have primarily melee DPS on Anetheron and ranged on infernals. Ranged do DPS on the boss whenever there are no infernals up, but they are told to take care of themselves (they wear a bit SR and step OOR each time they take a CS). This leaves us with 4 healers on MT/melee and 2 on OT/ranged. MT healers also wear SR gear.</div>

</div>I'm saying more on the end of 9 healers just really seems like overkill for RoS but each to their own I suppose. Different things are going to work with different guilds, so there is no perfect right number as some guilds have stronger healers then others allowing them to comfortably do things with less.<br>
<br>
@ AriasImmortal: That's pretty crazy man! You guys must have had some tip top DPS to learn RoS with 9 healers. I couldn't imagine learning it with 9, we could do it now easily because we've been farming for a while and our DPS geared out, but learning with 9 would have been rough. I guess it just goes to show that there's no magical number for every encounter, take what works best for you.<br>
<br>
We one nighted pre-nerf Shaz with 7 healers, so I guess we're just one of those guilds that prefers to roll light on healing.<br>
For our typical BT/Hyjal clearing I'll bring 7 healers for everything up to BB, swap in one more healer for BB&gt;Illidan making it 8 to clear the zone. Hyjal we do with 7 all the way through, possibly swapping in one more shaman for archimonde if the stars align and we somehow don't have 5 in the raid (having 6 raiding shaman is amazing, our typical raid comp includes 5 shaman in the raid).<br>
<br>
In the end of the day though, It's not a bad idea that when trying to learn the majority of BT/Hyjal content, if you have the extra healers handy, it's generally always a good idea to bring them in and if you find you need more DPS then sub out healing as you need. Aside from RoS nothing has a very steep dps requirement. <br>

Aside from Essence, everything is doable and probably optimal to have 8 healers in. a 9th wouldn't hurt on Gurtogg/Council and dropping to 7 helps some of the easier boss, but they're so easy it doesn't even matter...</div>

</div>We could certainly cut one healer off for each of our fights, but it works for us.  I think the best part would be to shave time off our trash clears, but we're down to 6 hours of BT, which isn't *too* slow.  I definitely prefer the extra buffer in case something goes wrong.</div>

Something absolutely obvious but that not a lot of people do is to ALWAYS put paladins in the double bloodboil groups, since paladins will get an insane amount of mana from getting healed through bloodboil.<br>

</div>I see, I'll remember the palidantactic! Regarding rogues, we usually bring 3-4 and yes we could probably bring more but we are a guild that likes to progress together and we very very seldom swap core-players out for stacking raids in a spesific way. In our core we have 3 mages, 3 warlocks etc. I'm not sure why I'm worrying too much about the encounter before we even see it, we have in the last 8 days downed 7 new bosses in hyjal/bt without much problem, so I'm sure we'll tackle him when the time comes. But it looks like a very hectic and hard fight so I'm as always trying to find ways to alleviate stress/problems and increasing our chance of success without leaving anyone behind or screwing people over :P</div>

</div>I found Illidan to be the easier and more controlled fight.  Once we've killed Archimonde quite a few times now it's feeling very easy, but the initial 80+ attempts were very frustrating.. while Illidan was fun learning.  Illidan really comes down to phase 2 tanks learning to dodge beams, after that it should be smooth sailing.  Fear ward for all priests now and the change so feared tanks don't lose aggro should help on learning Archi now too though.</div>

		<div id="post_message_556343">The catch with Archimonde is that it seems to be a less demanding fight in terms of healing &amp; damage.  This is actually a pretty big shift from a lot of fights up to that point.  Given that most players have been conditioned to squeeze out that last bit of dps, or to land that heal no matter what, trying to get them to switch into a "just survive" mode is pretty difficult.  The most frustrating aspect of Archimonde isn't really the fight itself, it's going through attempt after attempt waiting for people to finally "get it" so to speak.<br>
<br>
Bloodboil &amp; RoS are much more "stat fights", healing &amp; dps respectfully.  I think by deciding to do Archimonde first you'll give yourself a little more time to gear up via Najentus-&gt;Teron &amp; Hyjal, which should get you the gear you'll need.  Not to mention the hearts for Mother Shahraz.</div>

Illidan is the man you want to bring down each week, so giving up 2, 3, or even 4 archimonde kills is worth 1 extra Illidan kill in my opinion.</div>

</div>This is what impressed me most about the fight and its innovation in terms of the philosophy it forces you to adopt (aka 'just survive').<br>
<br>
Personally I think that guilds that just kill Kael should kill up to Azgalor (wont take long) +Akama then go directly to Archimonde. The catch is, of course:  whether you have fast/slow success on Archimonde is hugely dependant on the strat you adopt and your players skill+learning curve for the fights survival-mentality. <br>
<br>
If you have good players and a solid strat, id recommended trying to kill Archimonde ASAP. His loot is still excellent and your raiders will be happy there is an 'uber loot farm boss' killed weekly as you shift your new direction to Illidan.</div>

</div>I see where you are coming from though. Yea I agree hardest part of kaz'rogal was learning trash we killed him third attempt we got to him and ye we only used medallion and priest buff but we did get NPC's involved (thrall and warstomp warriors). <br>
<br>
The reason we went teron and ros before kaz'rogal was mainly cause it was just easier to get to them, we just couldn't be arsed learning trash but teron was quite a simple boss, ROS wasn't very hard either just required us to optimise each phase accordingly. I think we are going to focus on az'galor now though before we attempt Herr Gurtogg.</div>

</div>Using the right combination of mana potions, gems, evocation  and a shadowpriest I rarely go out of mana during Kazrogal. We found the fight to be pretty easy, like the rest of Hyjal (with the exception of Archimonde). We are at 5/5 Hyjal and 7/9 BT now, hardest fight to learn was RoS Phase 2. With Archimonde it just made "click" at some point and after many 80% wipes we went down to 27% and a kill. When we came back the next week Archimonde died within 3 pulls.<br>
<br>
It's worth learning the first four Hyjal Bosses before entering BT. They are easy to do (even Azgalor if you have good healers). Afterwards you will be able to do them within 2-3 hours and Najentus, Surpremus, Akama (possibly Gorefiend, he was easy enough for us) will die in quick sucession. Doing Hyjal also yields a decent amount of hearts of darkness.<br>
<br>
Edit: Fixed some tpyos. I am way too tired.<br>
Edit 2: q.e.d.</div>

My guild now is 4 weeks into t6 content. We cleared MH up to Kaz'rogal first. Last ID we one-shot Winterchill, Anetheron and  Kaz'rogal and went into BT for the first time the next day, easily killing Naj'entus, Supremus (and Akama). Yesterday we went for Azgalor (only tried him once before and unprepared) and he went down on the first try.<br>

But what to do now?<br>

I consider going for Archimonde, because of no trash and better loot, but am in fear of maybe demoralizing the guild with too many wipes. On the other hand I don't know, how hard Teron or Gurtogg would be.</div>

		<div id="post_message_560716">Honestly, archimonde is probably the most frustrating experience out of everything in those 2 instances. It's a flip of a coin, if your raid members get a couple good days they will take him down and everyone will be happy, if someone's having a bad day or chain dc's or has lag or his cat lands on the keyboard or his little brother shoots him with his water pistol or various other things I have heard from raid members, you are about to enter a world of pain. <br>
<br>
Teron is certainly easier, RoS has a longer learning curve but it's also much easier, gurtogg is not as difficult, but difficult in  a different way. In retrospect, we did only 1 archimonde kill before Illidan and I think it was a mistake to even do that as it just took us way too long. I would leave him last honestly. His no downtime/no trash recovery is a bait to lure you into his trap of frustration!</div>

		<div id="post_message_560728">There are some pros and cons to attempting Archimonde. We were 4/5 and 4/9 (Teron is quite easy but can be frustrating if the first 2-3 persons called don't manage clean kills of ghosts) and we went for Archimonde, spent 4 nights on him before getting the kill. I don't imagine we will really get him on farm status due to the nature of the fight (but maybe we will, too early to tell) but I think it was positive for the guild. MH/BT was a bit "easy mode" up to that point, and Archimonde was a good challenge at that point. The satisfaction of killing him, of getting access to a second piece of t6 gear and of clearing a new instance was really good. Gurtogg seems much easier, for example, but killing an end boss in t6 has nice motivational side effects.<br>
<br>
Moreover, the time investment was really important, but otherwise it's fine - just flask and die in doomfire and the cost of wiping repeatedly will be minimal.</div>

</div>That's a lot of potential loot to lose. It takes 2 hours tops to zone in BT and kill the first 3 bosses, and it takes less than 5 pulls per boss to learn. I could see going all Hyjal after 3/9 BT, but anything before that isn't such a good idea in my opinion.</div>

I think the most basic advice is Rage -&gt; first three in Black Temple -&gt; Anatheron and Kaz'Rogal.  After that, I believe almost every boss has the same overall degree of difficulty for learning and execution.  Azgalor and Archimonde are reccomended just because they drop Tier 6 and more loot overall.  Also, it's very helpful to have the ability to swap people in and out as needed.

				<div style="font-style:italic">There are some pros and cons to attempting Archimonde. We were 4/5 and 4/9 (Teron is quite easy but can be frustrating if the first 2-3 persons called don't manage clean kills of ghosts) and we went for Archimonde, spent 4 nights on him before getting the kill. I don't imagine we will really get him on farm status due to the nature of the fight (but maybe we will, too early to tell) but I think it was positive for the guild. MH/BT was a bit "easy mode" up to that point, and Archimonde was a good challenge at that point. The satisfaction of killing him, of getting access to a second piece of t6 gear and of clearing a new instance was really good. Gurtogg seems much easier, for example, but killing an end boss in t6 has nice motivational side effects.<br>
<br>
Moreover, the time investment was really important, but otherwise it's fine - just flask and die in doomfire and the cost of wiping repeatedly will be minimal.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>It took a while before our Archimonde kills felt like they got easier.  First kill was well upwards of 100 attempts (maybe even closer to 150 or more.. it's kind of a blur now), second kill still took 20 or 30 attempts, but  every week since then its gotten easier and easier.  We've one-shotted it a couple times, and last night even with a couple new people it only took 3 attempts.. so it definitely gets easier and more repeatable as people gear up.<br>
<br>
As for the cost of wiping, Doomfire can ease the burden for most of the raid.. but be patient if your tank starts feeling the burn. It is very difficult to have Doomfire cause the killing blow when you're tanking, especially when you're still learning and the wipe isn't called until the tank is already dead.   I spent around a thousand gold in repairs for our first archie kill, and easily over 300 ironshield potions.  I tend not to ask for handouts from my guild since repairs and consumables are a necessary cost of raiding, and I bear my burden like everyone else, but a few people insisted on donating to my repair costs that week, and it was greatly appreciated.<br>
<br>
Just be wary that while the rest of the raid is celebrating their cheap repair bills for learning that fight, your MT may be nervously eyeing his or her shrinking gold supply.</div>

		<div id="post_message_560943">I'd echo what Anathor said, I'd consider Teron frustrating for the first couple attempts, but once you get your raid experience with handling the ghosts, it should be repeatable every week.  Archimonde feels a bit more random, but I don't think my guild has mastered him yet either.<br>
<br>
I'd suggest killing Rage, First 3 bosses in BT/Anetheron, Kaz'rogal, Azgalor, Teron Gorefiend, then Archimonde.  Naj'entus is the hardest of the first 3 bosses in BT, once you get past him, it's basically free upgrades for your raid roster (not to mention reputation gains).  Kaz'rogal has the hardest trash of all the MH bosses, but he's also pretty easy to kill once you get to him.  Quite frankly, all the MH bosses are easy if you can handle the trash leading up to them.  I think we managed to kill all of them in about 2-3 attempts on the actual boss, however, it wasn't uncommon to wipe a couple times on trash packs that we weren't prepared for (this was before DBM started announcing what was in every pack, the big necro/banshee packs can be rough without shadow resist gear on).<br>
<br>
Most of the guilds on our server seem to be going with a 4/9 BT and 4/5 MH, then Archimonde approach.</div>

Yesterday night, raid time rolls around and there's an astounding 35 raiders online.

So why don't you just go kill al'ar to get the 4 raiders attuned and in the next two instance CD weeks, go get kael'thas and vashJ seperately?<br>
<br>
Also not being able to zone in T6 instance and getting "phatloots" will also likely motivate the raiders who didn't get their quest done to complete those ASAP.<br>

</div>We ran into the same problem of having to attune people weeks and months after we had killed Kael for the first time.  A combination of returning raiders and apps meant that we couldn't not do it eventually.  With our 5 day raid week, we had 1 night to clear MH farm bosses and 1 to clear BT farm bosses.  Of the remaining 3 nights, if we spent one on SSC and one on TK, that cut our "progression" raids from 3 a week to 1.  It's really hard to go back to SSC/TK if we're sharding most of the loot only to attune a few people, when we could be spending time learning new bosses in T6 content.<br>
<br>
In answer to your question I'd say that you definitely should kill the 3 BT bosses because there are some nice upgrades there for relatively little cost.  I'd go further to say that you should maintain as many progression nights as you possibly can at the expense of full-SSC and full-TK runs.  It sucks for the people who aren't attuned at the moment but it benefits them too; by the time they are attuned (a couple weeks at most?), your progression will be further along.  Furthermore, raid upgrades will help get those people attuned when you do go back to Kael.  The people who are not attuned at the moment should recognize that it's for the betterment of the raid to proceed on with content at their personal expense - as long as you propose a reasonable plan to get them attuned shortly, they should be okay with it (if they're not, that's a different story).<br>
<br>
As for a plan to get them attuned, I see from wowjutsu that there seems to be a guild on your server (&lt;Impact&gt;) stuck on Kael and a couple more with some progress in TK.  &lt;Paradigm Shift&gt; and &lt;Impact&gt; have significant progress on Vashj.  I don't know how possible this is since I'm not familiar with the guild dynamics on your server, but it could be beneficial to try and buy instances from these other guilds.  On Monday, these other guilds might decide that what you have to offer might be worth more than another night on those bosses - especially if they don't raid Mondays (or raid earlier than you do).  You can offer BT/MH gems (which they can't get otherwise and will help them immediately) - which you can get more of by spending more progression time.  You can offer spots in your raid so their RLs can see "how it's done".  Be creative.  I think there's already some discussion on these forums about buying instances.<br>
<br>
YMMV, that's just one thing that worked really well for us.  (Thanks to these boards for bringing it to our attention  )</div>

</div>Some combination of:<br>
1) Not fully motivated/focused (why are we here when we could be in BT?  To attune one person!)<br>
2) People that you're trying attune are new to the fights and therefore less effective<br>
3) At the time (1/5, 3/9 - no T6 and *that* many upgrades a week), not seriously outgearing the content you're trying to do<br>
4) Fights that were tuned to be punishing and could still wipe you a few times even after a half-dozen kills (mosty KT here, but Vashj was still a bit of a crapshoot for quite a few resets), especially in combination with 2).<br>
<br>
Or maybe your people are just better than ours </div>

</div>My guild went through this about a month ago, I can tell you how it ended up happening for us. 25 people killed Kael - 24 had Vashj Vials, so 24 people zoned in and killed Rage that night. <br>
<br>
Obviously at this point everyone is sick and tired of all T5 content, especially SSC. And they did not want to go back. But we are not a 25-30 person raid. We are a 35-40 person raid. So I quickly did the math for them and showed that we had to attune more people now or we couldn't maintain a steady roster. <br>
<br>
So what followed was 1 last Vashj kill and 2 more Kael kills (3 total). This got about 95-98% of the people attuned for Hyjal and a few stragglers still needed Karathress because they were lazy questers. After that we stopped doing T5 content for 3 weeks, knocked out 3 bosses in Hyjal and BT, got the gear and gems flowing in. And now we have a monthly scheduled key run, where we'll be keying up whoever missed a boss. <br>
<br>
During those 3 weeks (this is the third week) people started to notice the "crap we gotta fill that spot, grab so-and-so... oh wait they aren't keyed" problem. So now there wont be as much negativity about keying people up. Also, this first push we've killed 3/5 Hyjal, got Azgalor to 50% on our only attempt last night (with 3 healers getting doomed in a row, at the start) and we expect to kill him this week. We've tried Gorefiend and aren't too worried about that either. Don't worry about initial progress in T6 content, it is easy as advertised. <br>
<br>
Just get the people keyed now, progression and new fun times will happen. But the worst would be finding yourself at that 1-2 more attempts for a kill at 10:30 pm and you can't fill the raid because you stopped keying.</div>

		<div id="post_message_561130">Our last attunement run was when we were 4/5 3/9, and it took us about 10 hours total to run SSC + TK. The main reason was lack of focus mostly because of "grumble grumble we're just here to attune a few people" and "we should crush this content, I don't need to pay attention." We've actually never been able to clear SSC or TK in one 4 hour raid night, and always end up staying late or coming back to kill Kael or Vashj the next day. Hyjal is actually the first instance we've been capable of clearing in one night (it took us three hours yesterday) so our guild is probably just slow.</div>

		<div id="post_message_562323">We took a while to clear SSC as well last week and we're 5/5 MH 7/9 BT at that point. I believe it took us a total of 4 hours. Explaining to app what to do and having undergeared potential main switches kinda made a few fights harder than they should be. And yes, people weren't as motivated.<br>
<br>
As for Archimonde, we were just total fail learning that fight. It took us 5 weeks and maybe 150+ wipes. We just killed him for the fourth time last night and I think each kill afterwards took 4 tries at the most. Early on, we just had major problems even getting Archimonde low. Eventually, something just clicked and even bringing 1-2 apps, we can down him pretty easily. <br>
<br>
The strat we settled on was having melee group at Archimonde's back and a 3 lock/1 druid/1 other behind that melee group that has half the circle around Archimonde to them. That group is supposed to be as self-sufficient as possible. The other 3 ranged groups/healers are spread out by group behind the MT. Each group was supposed to be self sufficient but are spread out in a way that it's easier for the MT to be in range of healers and decursers/healers in range to help another group if need be.</div>

</div>Don't worry about your slow learners getting to be the ghost people. Afterall they will have to learn at some point and it is probably better they learn now, when you are all still getting the hang of the enoucnter. Imagine having your "fast" learners get the debuff all the time at first, giving you an easy kill after a few tries. Then you come back and the slowbies keep wiping the raid. Thats more frustrating than having them to learn it now.</div>

</div>It’s not always the matter of slow or fast learning. For me it was important to keep latency minimal and fps high enough.<br>
It’s not difficult to handle constructs. Only first person that gets it has it more difficult. Later on you have 2 ghosts at the same time and they can help each other.<br>
Only someone who dies before turning into ghost can cause wipe. Rest should handle their ghosts.<br>
Though we killed him few times we still wipe on him. I believe some people didn’t have a chance to become ghost though we did like 40 tries(few kills) in total.<br>
We also soulstone/battle res healers with shadow of death.<br>
I personally use keybinded macros with pet spell names on my bongos bars.</div>

		<div id="post_message_562799">We are 4/5 MH and 8/9 BT, we completely skipped Archimonde after a number of raids with little/no success. Wiping at somewhere between 70%-80% was really demorolizing, so we've just decided to focus on BT in an attempt to get an Illidan server first kill. I can't say I'm that bothered about it seeing as we've managed to get all the way up to Illidan (we were 2/9 when we downed Azgalor), but missing Archimonde's loot is certainly a pain <br>
<br>
My advice would be to just continue in BT if you're wiping forever on Archimonde. Teron is easy once people have been a ghost at least once, and people have macros in case their spellbars mess up, Bloodboil is certainly a lot less random than Archimonde and is quite easy to one or two-shot after the initial kill, Reliquary of Souls... well there's no trash and it's all about execution perfection, and Mother Shahraz can be one-shot from the firsts pull.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I've always been a fan of a triangle position on Anetheron, we don't use it - but it's something I came up with when my old guild was having problems.<br>
<br>
You basicly have Anetheron at any point of the camp, preferably with a long stretch of space right behind him. You then have 2 ranged groups at max range behind him, forming a triangle. Assign a couple of healers to stand at max range from those 2 groups to heal them. This way those healers will never (or rarely) take the hit from Carrion Swarm and can just happily heal away. And if they do get hit, the other raidhealers will just heal it for them. And you tank the infernals in between both ranged camps.<br>
It's a LOT like Ouro in that regard, if you ever did him.<br>
<br>
It's pretty hard to explain without a picture, so if you don't understand I could whip out a picture and have my awesome paint skills show.</div>

</div>We tried this tonight on our first night of attempts on Anetheron.  The triangle formation and tight clumping make sense for Carrion Swarm; what absolutely killed us, however, was infernals.  They would land on one person in the clump and pretty much splat the entire clump.  MD also seemed strangely not to work.<br>
<br>
What are we missing?  Is there a hidden "spawn time" on the infernals during which they don't have an aggro table (like that first second after Magtheridon unbanishes when MD'd shots have no effect on him?)  Do people need to be more proactive about running from infernal targets?</div>

</div>Incorrect, from the announce to the actual infernal spawns you can move it. You don't have a lot of time to do so though, so it requires people to be fast.<br>
<br>
In general, I'd say it's a faster Solarian. Everyone clump up, tightly, and then whoever gets it runs towards the tank and the group he is in runs the opposite way. Failure in moving can lead to several deaths, but really at that level it shouldn't be a major issue.</div>

		<div id="post_message_565054">We've had infernals land all over the place and it has never really been an issue.  I'm not sure clumping up is really the best strategy to be honest, that would seem to just invite a slow person to get a group destroyed by an infernal.  We only micromanage the healer set up, we usually run w/ 8 healers on Anatheron so we set them up in 2 man groups to the north/south/east/west of the boss, so only one group of healers will get Swarmed each time.  Everyone else we just tell to spread out around him and it works fairly well.  <br>
<br>
Thinking about it though, we really don't even have that many people to clump up in the first place.  Our DPS as a guild isn't great, and we've found it takes us about 6 ranged DPS to kill the infernals, which happens out of range of Anatheron anyway.  Since we have those 6 ranged, the infernal tank, and his healer (8 People) out range anyway, the MT and melee (7 people) naturally clumped up under anatheron, and the healers (7 people) already spread out, that only leaves 3 more people that need to spread around anatheron.  I can't see us being in a situation where we'd have 4 or 5 people clumped up to get blasted by an infernal regardless.   Maybe we do this fight wrong or weird though.</div>

		<div id="post_message_565320">We just make a circle around Anetheron, and tell people to "find a buddy". Every single person is supposed to be standing directly on top of one and only one other person. This cuts down a lot on weird angles for the Carrion Swarm ending up hitting 8-10 people. We consider a "good" Carrion swarm to be maximum of 6 people: 2-3 melee, and the targetted 2-3 ranged. You can't avoid the melee getting hit most of the time, since they're standing in on the boss and roughly half the Carrions will travel through them.<br>
<br>
We just tank the infernals about 15' from our MT, and no-one moves. Tab, nuke, rinse, repeat.<br>
<br>
And to reiterate what someone said above ... if you aren't running with Aggro Notification mods yet, stop being dumb and get them/one. The instant the boss targets you, start running toward your tank as the hunters throw up MD. You'll be 10' closer to the tank, and be out of the spot where it spawns; if you're especially fast, you can avoid taking the stun as well, which can/will save your life. <br>
<br>
Even if you get hit with the stun, moving fast means you're less likely to take landing dmg + stun + fire tick + fire tick = dead. I started having a lot more survival on the fight when I started reacting *fast* to infernals in my area.</div>
