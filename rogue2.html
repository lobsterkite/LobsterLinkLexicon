Please feel free to make suggestions for section changes/reorganization/content/whatever you want. Note that it's possible I've made errors in this post, or perhaps that the state of the rogue class changes over time. The remainder of this thread is available for the purpose of discussing such things. Please use it, that other rogue megathreads might be reduced in clutter somewhat.<br>

<font size="+1"><b>2. Aldriana's 7 Commandments of Rogue DPS</b></font><br>
<br>
The first step to success as a raiding rogue is to adhere to the 7 commandments of rogue DPS. Following these guidelines is by far the most important step to improving your DPS, and if you do not follow them, then nothing in the rest of this post will help you.<br>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li>Don't die.</li>
<li>Don't do anything that risks wiping the raid.</li>
<li>Maximize your time on target.</li>
<li>Don't let your energy cap out.</li>
<li>Don't let SnD drop.</li>
<li>Use one of the spreadsheets to figure out your best cycle; this will usually be the highest rupture uptime cycle that doesn't violate rule 4 or 5.</li>
<li>Use your cooldowns.</li>
</ol><br>
<font size="+1"><b>3. Weapon Selection and Talent Builds</b></font><br>
<br>
<b>On main hand theory:</b> in general, any considerations about weapon stats are subordinate to the fact of limited itemization. The selection of weapons provided supports a strategy of picking the highest DPS weapon of "slow" speed (1.7-1.9 for daggers, 2.6-2.8 for fists/maces/swords). Note: there are exceptions (e.g. <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304051213/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=30082"><span  ><span class="purplename">[Talon of Azshara]</span></span></a> &gt; <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304051213/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=32052"><span  ><span class="purplename">[Merciless Gladiator's Slicer]</span></span></a>).<br>
<br>
<b>On offhand theory:</b> for rogues with Combat Potency, a fast offhand is extremely important to increase the frequency of Combat Potency procs. For these builds, you can compare offhands by equating each 0.1 increment of speed to roughly 10 extra weapon DPS in favor of the faster weapon. For example, <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304051213/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=28189"><span  ><span class="bluename">[Latro's Shifting Sword]</span></span></a> is effectively 91.8 DPS when compared against <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304051213/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=28425"><span  ><span class="purplename">[Fireguard]</span></span></a>. Note that the stats on a weapon are still very important; for example, <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304051213/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=30865"><span  ><span class="purplename">[Tracker's Blade]</span></span></a> is superior to <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304051213/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=29275"><span  ><span class="purplename">[Searing Sunblade]</span></span></a> due to its stat allocation.<br>
<br>
For non-Combat Potency rogues, offhand weapon speed is less important, but can still impact DPS via poison procs and sword spec procs. For any rogue with sword spec, each 0.1 increment of speed can be equated to roughly 5 extra weapon DPS in favor of the faster weapon. For rogues without sword spec, you can convert each 0.1 increment to 2 extra weapon DPS for the faster weapon. For combat Mutilate builds, offhand speed is nearly immaterial. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304051213/http://roguecrap.blogspot.com/2007/03/mutilate-part-4-myth-on-off-hand-weapon.html" target="_blank">This article</a> points out that fast offhands suffer a very slight decrease in Mutilate damage relative to slow ones, most likely offsetting the increase in poison DPS.<br>
<br>
<b>On spec choice:</b> here's a rough ranking of PvE builds in terms of the <i>personal</i> DPS possible by each build at each tier of raid gear:<br>
<br>
Tier 4:<ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li>Combat swords (--) / Combat fist+sword (-0.12%) / Combat daggers (-0.51%)</li>
<li>Combat fists (-1.10%) / Combat mace+sword (-1.80%)</li>
<li>Combat maces (-3.27%)</li>
<li>Hemo+swords (-5.06%) / Hemo+Combat Potency (swords) (-5.62%)</li>
<li>Hemo+fists (-6.63%)</li>
<li>Hemo+Deadliness (-7.65%)</li>
<li>Hemo+maces (-8.49%)</li>
<li>Shadowstep (-14.45%)</li>
</ol><br>
Tier 5:<ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li>Combat swords (--) / Combat fist+sword (-0.22%)</li>
<li>Combat mace+sword (-1.15%) / Combat fists (-1.45%) / Combat daggers (-1.49%)</li>
<li>Combat maces (-2.64%)</li>
<li>Hemo+swords (-4.95%)</li>
<li>Hemo+Combat Potency (swords) (-5.52%)</li>
<li>Hemo+fists (-6.85%)</li>
<li>Hemo+Deadliness (-7.17%) / Hemo+maces (-7.85%)</li>
<li>Shadowstep (-13.91%)</li>
</ol><br>
Tier 6:<ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li>Combat swords (--) / Combat fist+sword (-0.29%) / Combat mace+sword (-0.93%)</li>
<li>Combat fists (-1.71%)</li>
<li>Combat maces (-2.52%)</li>
<li>Combat daggers (-3.16%)</li>
<li>Hemo+swords (-5.93%)</li>
<li>Hemo+Combat Potency (swords) (-6.09%)</li>
<li>Hemo+fists (-8.05%) / Hemo+Deadliness (-8.33%) / Hemo+maces (-8.73%)</li>
<li>Shadowstep (-15.79%)</li>
</ol><br>
In a 25-man raid, the Hemo debuff may contribute a substantial chunk of raid DPS, such that one Hemo rogue in the raid may make up for his loss of personal DPS. However, by tier 6, even a single rogue providing the debuff may not be worth the loss of personal DPS, and certainly it will not be worth having any more than one Hemo rogue in a raid regardless.<br>
<br>
Note that we do not currently have a model for Mutilate DPS as accurate as those for other specs. Thus, Mutilate has been omitted from the above lists. Empirical evidence suggests that Mutilate DPS is inferior to combat swords, but still reasonably competitive, possibly on par with combat daggers or Hemo-based specs.<br>
<br>
<b>On talents:</b> for PvE builds, the two most important talents in any tree are Relentless Strikes and Dual Wield Specialization (which therefore mandates Precision). For any combat build, mandatory talents are Improved Slice and Dice, Blade Flurry, Weapon Expertise, Aggression, Adrenaline Rush, Combat Potency, and Surprise Attacks, as well as an appropriate weapon specialization. Combat dagger specs additionally require Improved Backstab and Opportunity, while Sinister Strike builds require Improved Sinister Strike.<br>
<br>
Hemo builds have a large number of optional talents, with mandatory talents being Serrated Blades and Hemorrhage. For Hemo+sword builds, note that one point of Sword Specialization and one point of Weapon Expertise are each superior to one point of Dirty Deeds for sustained DPS. For Hemo+Deadliness builds, Blade Flurry is superior to the fifth point in Deadliness. Combat Mutilate builds also have a number of optional talents, with Cold Blood, Seal Fate, Vigor, Find Weakness, and Mutilate being required. Nearly all PvE-focused builds should carry the same initial point spread in Assassination: Malice, Ruthlessness, Murder, and Relentless Strikes. If there are still available points, spend them in Lethality, then Vile Poisons.<br>
<br>
<b>Sample builds:</b><br>
<br>
Here are sample builds for each typical rogue raid spec. Keep in mind when looking at these which talents are required and which ones are up to taste.<br>

<font size="+1"><b>4. Regarding the Hit and Expertise Caps</b></font><br>
<br>
In the context of stats, the term "cap" refers to the point at which equipping more of a particular stat will have no additional value. For hit rating and expertise rating in particular, the cap usually discussed is for the effect of these stats on raid bosses. For example, once you reach or surpass the hit cap, you will never miss an attack against a raid boss unless you are under the effect of some debuff that reduces your hit chance (for example, Attumen the Huntsman's curse). <b>There is no "minimum" chance to miss melee attacks, nor to be dodged or parried.</b><br>
<br>
Your base chance to miss a raid boss while dual wielding is 28% with auto-attack on both hands. Your base chance to miss a special attack is 9%. For each 15.77 hit rating you equip, you reduce your chance to miss by 1%. Thus we can calculate hit caps for auto-attack and special attacks:<br>
<br>
Auto-attack, 0/5 Precision: 442<br>
Auto-attack, 5/5 Precision: 363<br>
Special, 0/5 Precision: 142<br>
Special, 5/5 Precision: 64<br>
<br>
Your base chance to be dodged by a raid boss with any attack is thought to be 6.5%. For each 3.94 expertise rating you equip, you gain 1 expertise, reducing your chance to be dodged by 0.25% (thus it takes exactly 15.77 expertise rating to reduce your chance to be dodged by 1%). Thus, we can calculate expertise caps for various combinations of talents and racial abilities:<br>
<br>
0/2 Weapon Expertise, non-Human: 103<br>
1/2 Weapon Expertise, non-Human: 83<br>
2/2 Weapon Expertise, non-Human: 64<br>
0/2 Weapon Expertise, Human (wielding swords or maces): 83<br>
1/2 Weapon Expertise, Human: 64<br>
2/2 Weapon Expertise, Human: 44<br>
<br>
<b>The hit and expertise caps are NOT magic numbers that every rogue [or any rogue] must reach. Whether you're in T4 or T6, there are NO MAGIC NUMBERS for how much hit or expertise rating you "should" have.</b> There is no special benefit to being capped with either stat, nor is there any special benefit to reaching an arbitrary threshold. The purpose of listing the caps here is so that you do not accidentally overshoot either cap by equipping too much hit rating or expertise rating. Always remember that any hit rating or expertise rating beyond the cap will have zero positive effect on your DPS.<br>
<br>
<font size="+1"><b>5. Gear Selection</b> - Please consider this section of dubious merit until this disclaimer is removed.</font><br>
<br>
In this section, rather than listing comparisons between every piece of gear a rogue could conceivably obtain, I will describe a general-purpose system for comparing pieces of gear against one another. To compare two pieces, you can give each stat a "weight" proportional to its DPS contribution relative to other stats. Let's call this weight Equivalence Points (EP). We'll define 1 AP = 1 EP; that is, 1 attack power is worth exactly 1 Equivalence Point. Now we can use a spreadsheet to determine how much DPS a single point of any stat provides relative to a single point of attack power, and convert those directly into EP values.<br>
<br>
To utilize the EP weights, simply take a piece of gear and multiply each stat bonus on that piece by the EP weight for that stat. In case of gem sockets, figure out how you would gem the piece in actual use (instructions for gemming are given in the following section), and multiply the stats provided by each gem by their respective EP weights. Any stat provided that does not have direct DPS value (e.g. stamina, dodge rating, resilience) can be valued at 0 EP. Examples of using the EP weights are provided below.<br>
<br>
<b>Tier 4:</b> the following is a table of EP values for sword (16/41+4), dagger (15/41/5), Hemo+sword (11/28/22), and Hemo+Deadliness (11/21/29) builds, assuming a projected tier 4 level of gear and buffs (10-man raid).<br>

</div>Here's an example tier 6 comparison for a sword rogue with Blessing of Kings:<br>
<br>
Ring of Deceitful Intent<br>
+21 Agility ---&gt; 21 x 1.90 x 1.1 = <b>43.89 EP</b><br>
+42 Stamina ---&gt; 0 EP<br>
Equip: Improves hit rating by 19. ---&gt; 19 x 2.23 = <b>42.37 EP</b><br>
Equip: Increases attack power by 58. ---&gt; <b>58 EP</b><br>
Total: 43.89 + 42.37 + 58 = <b>144.26 EP</b><br>
<br>
Signet of Primal Wrath<br>
+28 Agility ---&gt; 28 x 1.90 x 1.1 = <b>58.52 EP</b><br>

Equip: Your attacks ignore 126 of your opponent's armor. ---&gt; 126 x 0.32 = <b>40.32 EP</b><br>
Total: 58.52 + 58 + 40.32 = <b>156.84 EP</b><br>
<br>
Judging by these EP weights, <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304051213/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=33496"><span  ><span class="purplename">[Signet of Primal Wrath]</span></span></a> is a significant upgrade over <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304051213/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=32266"><span  ><span class="purplename">[Ring of Deceitful Intent]</span></span></a>.<br>
<br>
<b>On stat weight scaling:</b> each stat's EP value will tend to scale with your gear, talents, and raid buffs. Sinister Calling will increase the EP value of agility by about 15%, while Blessing of Kings will increase the EP values of agility and strength by 10%. Deadliness will increase the DPS contribution of strength, agility, and attack power, which will have the effect of reducing the EP values of any other stats. On-hit procs such as Windfury, Mongoose, Combat Potency, and <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304051213/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=28830"><span  ><span class="purplename">[Dragonspine Trophy]</span></span></a> will all increase the values of hit and expertise ratings, while <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304051213/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=32409"><span  ><span class="bluename">[Relentless Earthstorm Diamond]</span></span></a> and Mace Specialization will both increase the value of crit rating. All of the EP weights given above are examples based on a theoretical raid composition and gear/talent setup; for the most exact valuation of stats, you should always consult a spreadsheet.<br>
<br>
<b>On set bonuses:</b> in general, take advantage of set bonuses when you can, but don't marry yourself so tightly to a set bonus that you never upgrade your gear. Set bonuses worth pursuing are Wastewalker 2pc, T4 2pc, T5 4pc, T6 2pc and 4pc. A good rule of thumb for any of these set bonuses is to preserve it until you are able to get the next set bonus on the list (e.g. keep using T4 2pc until you have 4 pieces of T5 to equip).<br>
<br>
<b>On trinkets:</b> <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304051213/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=28830"><span  ><span class="purplename">[Dragonspine Trophy]</span></span></a> is the best trinket in the game for combat rogues, currently. <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304051213/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=32492"><span  ><span class="purplename">[Ashtongue Talisman of Lethality]</span></span></a>, <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304051213/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=32505"><span  ><span class="purplename">[Madness of the Betrayer]</span></span></a>, and <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304051213/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=30450"><span  ><span class="purplename">[Warp-Spring Coil]</span></span></a> (which becomes powerful particularly at T6 level) are on the next tier down, then <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304051213/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=30627"><span  ><span class="purplename">[Tsunami Talisman]</span></span></a> and <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304051213/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=33831"><span  ><span class="purplename">[Berserker's Call]</span></span></a>. <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304051213/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=28579"><span  ><span class="purplename">[Romulo's Poison Vial]</span></span></a> is good if you have plenty of room under the hit cap. <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304051213/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=29383"><span  ><span class="purplename">[Bloodlust Brooch]</span></span></a>, <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304051213/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=31856"><span  ><span class="purplename">[Darkmoon Card: Crusade]</span></span></a>, <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304051213/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=28288"><span  ><span class="bluename">[Abacus of Violent Odds]</span></span></a>, <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304051213/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=28034"><span  ><span class="bluename">[Hourglass of the Unraveller]</span></span></a>, and <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304051213/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=28121"><span  ><span class="bluename">[Icon of Unyielding Courage]</span></span></a> are all good pre-raiding options.

<br>
<font size="+1"><b>6. Gem Selection</b></font><br>
<br>
<b>On meta gems:</b> you want a headpiece with a meta gem socket. Use <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304051213/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=32409"><span  ><span class="bluename">[Relentless Earthstorm Diamond]</span></span></a> in that socket. <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304051213/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=32410"><span  ><span class="bluename">[Thundering Skyfire Diamond]</span></span></a> is inferior due to a ~40 second cooldown, 6 second duration, and low proc rate, but it is the second-best option for the socket. <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304051213/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=25894"><span  ><span class="bluename">[Swift Skyfire Diamond]</span></span></a> is nowhere near as good as either of these, and should be avoided.<br>
<br>
<b>On combat gem selection:</b> only gem for socket bonuses that provide offensive stats (hit/crit rating, agility, AP), and only if they are achievable using solely red and yellow gems. If you are socketing for a bonus, always use <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304051213/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=24051"><span  ><span class="bluename">[Rigid Dawnstone]</span></span></a> in yellow sockets and <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304051213/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=24061"><span  ><span class="bluename">[Glinting Noble Topaz]</span></span></a> in red sockets, unless you are nearing the hit cap, in which case use <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304051213/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=24061"><span  ><span class="bluename">[Glinting Noble Topaz]</span></span></a> in yellow sockets and <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304051213/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=24028"><span  ><span class="bluename">[Delicate Living Ruby]</span></span></a> in red sockets.<br>
<br>
Pay attention to your meta gem socket requirements, as both recommended meta gems (Relentless and Thundering) require 2 blue gems. Only use <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304051213/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=24055"><span  ><span class="bluename">[Shifting Nightseye]</span></span></a> to fulfill the requirement, and only as many as necessary.

<br>
<b>On Hemo gem selection:</b> for Hemo+sword builds, gem very much the same as you would for combat. For Hemo+Deadliness, prefer <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304051213/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=24028"><span  ><span class="bluename">[Delicate Living Ruby]</span></span></a> for red sockets (or for all sockets, if not gemming for a bonus) and <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304051213/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=24061"><span  ><span class="bluename">[Glinting Noble Topaz]</span></span></a> for yellow sockets. <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304051213/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=24055"><span  ><span class="bluename">[Shifting Nightseye]</span></span></a> should still be the gem of choice for satisfying the 2 blue gem requirement of RED or TSD. Only if you know for certain you will never be getting Blessing of Kings, <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304051213/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=24031"><span  ><span class="bluename">[Bright Living Ruby]</span></span></a> and <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304051213/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=31863"><span  ><span class="bluename">[Balanced Nightseye]</span></span></a> are appropriate gems for a Hemo+Deadliness build.<br>
<br>
<b>On Mutilate gem selection:</b> Mutilate builds should prefer <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304051213/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=24028"><span  ><span class="bluename">[Delicate Living Ruby]</span></span></a> for red sockets (or for all sockets, if not gemming for a bonus) and <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304051213/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=24061"><span  ><span class="bluename">[Glinting Noble Topaz]</span></span></a> for yellow sockets.

<br>
<b>On unique gems:</b> several unique-equip gems are available from heroics, jewelcrafting, and PvP which may be used in place of any of the gems mentioned above. The following gems may be obtained and used in any socket where a rare ("blue" quality) gem of the same color would normally be placed. Any gem not listed below is inferior and should be avoided. Note that any of the gems listed as Heroic drops will no longer be unique-equip in patch 2.4, and therefore will be able to be farmed for all available sockets.<br>

<br>
<font size="+1"><b>7. Combo Point Cycles</b></font><br>
<br>
"Combo point cycle" refers to the algorithm used by a rogue to determine what finishers to use, and in what order, during sustained combat (e.g. against a raid boss). A combo point cycle revolves around keeping Slice and Dice active as close to 100% of the time as possible while also keeping Rupture active as much as possible. Eviscerate should only be used if the target is close to death, if the target is bleed-immune, or if you already have Slice and Dice and Rupture up with plenty of time left. See the Mechanics section for more about Eviscerate.<br>
<br>
Combo point cycles are usually expressed in the format "1s/5r" or "3s/5s/5e" (for example). Each number-letter pair indicates a finisher to be used at a certain number of CP. An 's' represents Slice and Dice, an 'r' represents Rupture, and an 'e' represents Eviscerate. Thus, 1s/5r represents a cycle where you gain 1 CP, use Slice and Dice, gain 5 CP, use Rupture, and then repeat; and 3s/5s/5e represents a cycle where you gain 3 CP, use Slice and Dice, gain 5 CP, use Slice and Dice again, gain 5 CP, use Eviscerate, and then repeat. For maximum performance, do not deviate from the cycle unless you are forced to stop attacking the target.<br>
<br>
<b>On combat cycles:</b> combat builds using swords, fists, maces, or any combination thereof will generally use a 4s/5r cycle, unless the rogue has T4 2pc, in which case he should use 1s/5r. If the target is immune to bleed effects, use 5s/5e (or 2s/5e, if you have T4 2pc). Combat dagger builds should use a 3s/5s/5r cycle, unless the rogue has T4 2pc, in which case he should use 1s/3r. If the target is immune to bleed effects, use 3s/5s/5e (or 1s/3e, if you have T4 2pc).<br>
<br>
<b>On Hemo cycles:</b> Hemo builds should use a 5s/5r cycle, unless the rogue has T4 2pc, in which case he should use 2s/5r. Substitute Eviscerate in place of Rupture if the target is immune to bleed effects.<br>
<br>
<b>On Mutilate cycles:</b> Mutilate doesn't use a fixed cycle because its CP generation can vary widely. Rather, a Mutilate build uses a general policy of "3+" or "4+", performing finishers after a certain minimum number of CP (either 3 or 4) have been accumulated. Finishers used are SnD, Rupture, and Eviscerate/Envenom, in order of priority (note: see the Mechanics section regarding Envenom). Be sure to balance finisher usage to get the most value out of Find Weakness procs.<br>
<br>
<b>On movement and on-the-fly cycles:</b> in many fights, rogues will be required to run in and out of melee range with the boss, or will be prevented at times from entering melee range to continue their cycle. Depending on the length of time you'll be out of melee range, there are many ways to handle these situations. If the interruption will only be brief (less than 10 seconds between leaving melee range and reentering it), your energy bar should be able to absorb the delay and you can continue your cycle when you get back into melee range as if nothing had happened. Otherwise, you should either burn your CP immediately on a Rupture (or Eviscerate, in the case of a bleed-immune target) or save them for a Slice and Dice when you next enter melee. In some fights, it is impossible to predict how often you will be interrupted or for how long. In these situations, your best bet is to get Slice and Dice up immediately upon starting melee and keep it up at all costs, only Rupturing if you have extra combo points to burn.<br>
<br>
<font size="+1"><b>8. Buffs and Enchants</b></font><br>
<br>
<b>On raid buffs:</b> the standard raid group for a rogue is typically feral druid + DPS warrior + enhance shaman + rogue + rogue (or something similar). The biggest party-based DPS buffs for a combat build are Battle Shout (5/5 improved), Unleashed Rage, Grace of Air/Windfury (see further below), Leader of the Pack, in that order. If your raid is short on paladins, Salvation &gt; Might &gt; Kings. If your raid doesn't have an enhancement shaman, a resto shaman in the group dropping totems is the next best thing (Unleashed Rage is a big loss, but Windfury Totem and Grace of Air Totem provide nearly their full benefit even if the shaman doesn't have the talents for them).<br>
<br>
<b>On self-buffs:</b> <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304051213/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=22854"><span  ><span class="whitename">[Flask of Relentless Assault]</span></span></a> is the best DPS option for your elixir slots; however, <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304051213/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=22831"><span  ><span class="whitename">[Elixir of Major Agility]</span></span></a> is very close behind.

<br>
<b>On poisons and Windfury:</b> for PvE, always choose DP on the offhand. If you are in a group with a shaman and you're combat, you'll get more DPS from Windfury as opposed to Grace of Air + IP. However, the difference is not as dramatic as it is for, say, a DPS warrior. If your group contains a DPS warrior, Windfury Totem will usually be dropped. Otherwise, if less than half the group is rogues, Grace of Air Totem will probably be dropped and you should use IP on the MH. Always check with your shaman if you're unsure what will be dropped. For Mutilate, Grace of Air Totem might be preferable, but Windfury Totem is still quite powerful. Note that dual DP is a waste for all builds except Mutilate, and only if you use Envenom. For all builds, <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304051213/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=23529"><span  ><span class="greenname">[Adamantite Sharpening Stone]</span></span></a> are inferior unless the target is immune to poisons.<br>
<br>
<b>On weapon enchants:</b> Mongoose and Executioner are the only currently viable weapon enchants. Initially, Mongoose will be superior on both hands. However, as you obtain passive armor penetration from gear, as well as other armor penetration procs (typically at T6 level), Executioner will surpass Mongoose. The important thing to note is that while two weapons with Mongoose can proc two separate Lightning Speed buffs (for a total of 240 agility and two 2% haste buffs), two weapons with Executioner will only be able to proc and refresh a single Executioner buff. As a result, it is worthwhile to use Executioner only on one weapon, not both. Once Executioner surpasses Mongoose for you, then it makes sense to enchant Executioner on the weapon which will have greater uptime (to maximize the DPS increase from switching). Thus, the general guideline is to use Mongoose/Mongoose until roughly T6, at which point you should switch to Executioner/Mongoose.<br>
<br>
<b>On other enchants:</b> <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304051213/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=28888"><span  ><span class="bluename">[Greater Inscription of Vengeance]</span></span></a> (Aldor) is very slightly better than <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304051213/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=28910"><span  ><span class="bluename">[Greater Inscription of the Blade]</span></span></a> (Scryer). 15 agility to gloves is superior to 26 attack power.

If you are an enchanter, Stats should be your ring enchant of choice, unless you are daggers, in which case Striking will come out very slightly ahead.

<br>
<font size="+1"><b>9. Mechanics</b></font><br>
<br>
<b>On haste:</b> haste effects provide extra attacks per time unit equal to their magnitude; so Slice and Dice provides 30% extra attacks over its duration compared to without it. Percentage-based haste effects are multiplicative; however, rating-based haste effects (e.g. <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304051213/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=28830"><span  ><span class="purplename">[Dragonspine Trophy]</span></span></a>) are all added together into a total haste rating before being converted (at a rate of 15.77 rating to 1%) into a single percentage-based haste. Thus, separate percentage-based hastes increase one another's effects, while separate rating-based hastes do not do the same. As a result, coordinating rating-based hastes (e.g. trying to time a Haste Potion and Abacus of Violent Odds simultaneously with a Dragonspine Trophy proc and Dragonstrike proc) will not have any special effects. However, coordinating percentage-based hastes (e.g. hitting Blade Flurry together with Bloodlust) will increase your benefits.<br>
<br>
<b>On cooldown usage:</b> because of the way different stats scale with one another, it is generally preferable to use DPS-increasing cooldowns simultaneously rather than one at a time. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304051213/http://elitistjerks.com/389595-post14.html" target="_blank">This post</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304051213/http://elitistjerks.com/448957-post20.html" target="_blank">this post</a> demonstrate the increased effect possible by simultaneously triggering cooldowns, especially haste-based effects. In general, you should use cooldowns as they become available. However, in some cases of cooldowns with staggered timers (e.g. Blade Flurry and Troll Berserking), it may be best, when the longer cooldown becomes available, to delay it slightly until the shorter one also becomes available. See <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304051213/http://elitistjerks.com/515015-post83.html" target="_blank">this post</a> for more detail.<br>
<br>
<b>On Eviscerate:</b> at nearly all reachable levels of gear, Rupture will be superior to Eviscerate on any target that isn't immune to bleeds. At 5 CP, Rupture deals 1000 damage plus 24% of your AP for 25 energy, or 40 damage plus 0.96% of your AP per energy. At 5 CP and with T5 2pc, Eviscerate deals 1245 damage plus 15% of your AP for 35 energy, or roughly 35.57 damage plus 0.43% of your AP per energy. Applying 3/3 Improved Eviscerate and 3/3 Aggression (121% modifier), 40% crit and RED (142.4% modifier), and 30% armor reduction (assuming a typical debuffed raid boss), Eviscerate comes to 42.90 damage plus 0.52% of your AP per energy. Thus, Eviscerate holds an advantage of 2.90 base damage per energy, but Rupture gains an additional 0.44% of your AP. At this rate, it takes only 656 AP for Rupture to overcome Eviscerate's base advantage. Simply, in any situation where you can Rupture, you should Rupture.<br>
<br>
<b>On Shiv:</b> Shiv cannot be dodged or parried, and like other offhand attacks, it can proc Combat Potency. Even so, its damage per energy will be inferior to Sinister Strike or Backstab almost regardless of stats, largely due to the offhand damage penalty and the lack of any static damage boost built into the ability. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304051213/http://elitistjerks.com/481977-post739.html" target="_blank">This post</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304051213/http://elitistjerks.com/482277-post745.html" target="_blank">this addendum</a> contain some sample calculations of Shiv DPE. Shiv spam with DP offhand and Envenom is inferior to Rupture-based cycles in most raid/group situations (see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304051213/http://elitistjerks.com/482003-post741.html" target="_blank">this post</a>).<br>
<br>
<b>On Envenom:</b> Envenom damage is not mitigated by armor, and can be boosted by Stormstrike, Misery (shadow priest debuff), and Vile Poisons. However, in all but the most favorable circumstances (for example, extremely high crit, T5 2pc, RED, 5/5 Vile, Stormstrike and Misery both up), Envenom's DPE will be inferior to Rupture. The more apt comparison to make is Envenom versus Eviscerate. At 5 CP and untalented (talents can boost both abilities by roughly the same: Envenom by 20%, Eviscerate by 21%), Envenom 2 deals 900 base damage plus 15% of AP, while Eviscerate deals 1045 damage plus 15% of AP. However, Eviscerate damage is mitigated by armor, which is typically roughly 30% damage reduction by a raid boss. Thus, Envenom is, at base, slightly better straight-up DPE than Eviscerate. However, Envenom results in the loss of your entire DP stack, resulting in a drop of roughly 45 DPS (before Vile Poisons) for as long as it takes to get the full stack up again. A Mutilate build running dual DP can get enough DPS out of Envenom and DP to make it worthwhile to use. However, for other builds, if you must choose between Eviscerate and Envenom, choose Eviscerate.<br>

		<div id="post_message_505353">Weapon speed on mutilate does "matter" but the degree to which it matters is not very large - Kalman had a post back in pf's old thread (I believe) which showed that if you have a reasonable upgrade DPSwise from an offhand dagger, the speed was not a SIGNIFICANT factor to its performance.  However, given equal statted/dps daggers, the slower offhand will do (slightly) more damage.<br>
<br>
General BT gem rarity from what I can tell from other posts is that the red gems (Crimson Spinel) are in very high demand, so +10 agi gems for rogues aren't a high priority.  Given that Rigid Lionseye and Glinting Pyrestones are damn near the same level of DPS and in less demand from other classes, these are excellent choices for the T6 rogue to pursue.  Things may change with the Sunwell, depending on changing number/type of sockets on the gear there, and of course, what sort of stats the gear there has.<br>

If anyone with Hyjal/BT experience could provide some information about what gems are common or rare, what gems are in high demand by other classes, and anything else I should know about Hyjal/BT gemming, I'd greatly appreciate it.</div>

</div>Not sure how it is for other guilds, but Crimson Spinels are in huge demand from our casters; if I ever wanted to gem 10agi or 20ap for whatever reason, I would have a lot of competition. We seem to have plenty of Lionseyes and Pyrestones though, so 10hit, 10crit, or 5agi/5hit is no problem. 10hit does require your JCs to be Revered with Hyjal, so any gear early on in the instance will have to make do with something else.</div>

<br>
There are a few filler points in the middle of the assassination tree.  You can forgo either of Fleet Footed or Quick Recovery to put points into Improved Poisons, Imp. Kidney Shot or Master Poisoner but these are really minimal changes based on the flavour of your playstyle.  <br>
<br>
Fleet Footed is a decent dps increase (even more so in 2.3 where it's a 15% speed increase) whenever you're running a lot in an encounter and Quick Recovery is a small dps increase with the bonus of your bandages ticking for just that little bit more which is why I prefer them.<br>
<br>
In the combat tree the main talents are Imp. Slice and Dice, Precision and Dual Wield Spec. with the others being fillers.  I chose Imp. SS and Gouge because a lot of the time you can't be behind the mob and this enables to build CP more cheaply for a KS to regain position or gives you a little more time to regen energy after a Gouge when regaining position.  These are probably as useful in a raid situation as Lightning Reflexes so it's pretty much your choice what to take.<br>
<br>
Other builds such as 41/15/5 to get Opportunity or 41/0/20 for Serrated Blades are not recommended for PvE DPS due to the fact that Opportunity nor Serrated Blades can give the DPS increase that Imp. SnD, Precision or Dual Wield Spec give.<br>
<br>
There should be something said in the Mutilate section about cycles.  It is more complicated running Mut cycles because of the ever-changing number of CP that you generate, coupled with the fact that you want to maximise the benefit of your 10 seconds of Expose Weakness after every finisher.  When I played Mut I ran a 4+ cycle, meaning every time I got 4 or more CP I threw a finisher.  For the most part the finishers are SnD and Rupture but sometimes you end up with 4 CP and a long time left on your Rupture.  In this situation you can either wait for the Rupture to tick off (letting your energy to regen, but not over 100) before refreshing it, otherwise an Eviscerate can be used to spend the CP.<br>
<br>
Windfury, poisons and Mutulate:  I'm not sure what the optimal setup for a Mut rogue is nowadays.  Before the WF nerf it was no question what you used on your mainhand but I have read some people talking about running with dual Deadly Poison and using Envenom over eviscerate/rupture.  Someone else should elucidate the intricacies of this problem as I haven't played Mut for a while.<br>

</div>An example I use to illustrate this is: let's say you are far below the hit cap and are trying to choose between two upgrades to your gear. If one upgrade gives you +1 AP and the other gives you +1 hit rating, you should choose +1 to hit, since it is clearly the better option.<br>
<br>
If on the other hand, one upgrade gives you +100 AP and the other gives you +1 hit rating, you would be foolish to choose the +1 hit; regardless of how far below the cap you are, 100 AP is still a better upgrade.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
It's an extreme case, but many people seem to think that the hit cap is the only thing that maximizes their DPS, and make the wrong choices in these kinds of tradeoffs without realizing it.</div>

</div>Hm, those two statements do sound contradictory. What I'm getting at is that if you have two pieces of gear and one just happens to have more hit on it, doesn't make the piece with more hit better. In other words, even if you're not hit-capped, you should always consider the overall stats on an item, and not just the hit rating. Just by way of a simple example, I would expect most rogues would prefer Warp-Spring Coil over Romulo's Poison Vial, even if they're not hit-capped.<br>

Actually, I have done testing that shows that Opportunity and Surprise Attacks are additive.  Spec both without Murder.  Go out to the Dwarf start area.  Kick some level 1 Young Ragged Wolves to verify 0 armor gives 110/220 on a crit.  Now backstab them multiple times with a starter dagger.  Guess what?  <br>
The damage is consistant with (DAMAGE+(AP/14*1.7)) * 1.5 + 255 ) * 1.3<br>
and not with<br>
(DAMAGE+(AP/14*1.7)) * 1.5 + 255 ) * 1.2 * 1.1<br>
<br>
Even if you want to believe the armor is above 0 but still rounds to 110, the kick test proves the armor is not high enough to give damage reduction consistant with Opportunity and Surprise Attacks being multiplicative.<br>

</div>Purely for the sake of arguement....<br>
<br>
The implied proof here is that a player that has 'skill' yields better results than a player that has no/less 'skill'. The same is true for 'good' gear vs 'bad' gear. There is no way to meaningfully quantify whether 'skill' (and its implications) are &gt; or &lt; 'gear'. Spec and gear ALWAYS make a difference, as each marginal change in how talent points are spent, or how gear is itemized has a non-zero change on a relevant variable in the game, whether a stat on the stat sheet, DPS, health, etc. (which I guess are all stats on the stat sheet :P). Only reason one might say that these two things 'don't matter' is that they are not quantifiable until 'skill' can be controlled out of the equation...<br>

</div>Definitely true. I think the important thing to glean, though, is that skill is definitely a consideration. I've heard many a rogue quip that playing a rogue takes zero skill, hell, I've certainly joked about it from time to time. However, we regularly see instances where a rogue with a particular level of gear, gemmed and specced properly, defies logic by putting out DPS that rogues half his level could achieve.<br>
<br>
There are a lot of intangibles at play. Sometimes, it has to do with how you survive during fights. Sometimes, it has to do with how attentively you keep on target. Sometimes, it has to do with simply being more awake and alert during a raid than someone else. Never let yourself believe for a second, though, that maximizing your DPS takes zero skill. There's a wide gulf between your max theoretical DPS output and what you can do if you just go on autopilot during raids.<br>
<br>
...sorry, a lot of that rant is horribly off-topic, but it's just something I've talked about with my guild lately.</div>

<br>
(edit) Never mind, I see, you're looking for information on how it may scale with gear. Let me see if I can't cook up some numbers on that.<br>
<br>
(edit 2) Taking the same spreadsheet I used to do the comparison from post #30, I first started with <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302210754/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=30082"><span  ><span class="purplename">[Talon of Azshara]</span></span></a> and <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302210754/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=32027"><span  ><span class="purplename">[Merciless Gladiator's Quickblade]</span></span></a>. Theoretical DPS: 1407.68.<br>
<br>
Arbitrarily, I add 1000 AP. DPS increases by 290.57.<br>
Now I remove that AP and instead arbitrarily add 600 crit rating. DPS increases by 285.38.<br>
<br>
Now I switch weapons to <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302210754/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=28439"><span  ><span class="purplename">[Dragonstrike]</span></span></a> and <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302210754/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=31958"><span  ><span class="purplename">[Merciless Gladiator's Bonecracker]</span></span></a>. Theoretical DPS: 1372.82.<br>
<br>
Arbitrarily, I add 1000 AP. DPS increases by 285.09.<br>
Now I remove that AP and instead arbitrarily add 600 crit rating. DPS increases by 297.77.<br>
<br>
Obviously, the implication is that maces scale better with crit rating after the change, but swords continue to scale better with AP. Additionally, it would clearly take ungodly amounts of crit rating for the mace bonus to scale past the inherent DPS deficit it suffers at this gear level (and itemization doesn't really favor maces past this gear level, either, whereas swords have one more tier to go).</div>

		<div id="post_message_514199">Roughly, going by just white damage, you get an extra sword attack proc every 20 swings. Brief check of the Illidan WWS last night shows my MH hitting for an average (noncrit)of 523, with a 34% average crit, so the average sword proc would hit for 700?<br>
<br>
So for mace spec, in that 20 swings, the extra crit damage would have to add up to more than 700 damage, or 35 damage a swing. Average MH crit was ~1192, which would occur 6.8 times in those 20 swings. +5% damage of 1192 is 59.6 damage * 6.8 occurances in 20 swings = 405 damage, and that's just counting MH swings.<br>
<br>
Seems like sword spec would still be superior, unless I suck at math, which is very likely.<br>
<br>
(edit - I'm using s2 MH and s2 OH, which have a very confined damage range, so it's likely that the wider range on maces ie syphon, s2 mace, etc would make up for some of the lost damage.)</div>

</div>That raises an interesting question...for raiding purposes, does anyone actually use Surefooted? It's definitely a good DPS enchant, but the allure of Cat's Swiftness is actually the speed boost, which you can't replicate with any combination of stats. I vaguely recall a derivation in the first post of the enhancement shaman thread showing that Cat's Swiftness easily surpasses any other enchant if you spend a certain percentage of a fight having to move between targets. It was a small percentage.<br>
<br>
If anyone can make a serious case that Surefooted is useful and is used in raids, then I will be sure to add a note saying so. Otherwise, perhaps I will instead add a summary of my above paragraph explaining why Cat's Swiftness is preferred over the other two.</div>

<br>
Surefooted is a decent enchant if you need the hit rating, but given that Dexterity is easier to get, takes 1 less primal nether (i.e. 0), and is better (even if by only 1 AEP) then I'd argue for going Dexterity if you're considering only damage output.  I have Cat's Swiftness on my boots, and I doubt I'm going back - there's just far too many fights where movement is a key concept.  I think Aldriana had a post on it somewhere in the gear thread that said she used two pairs of boots, one with swiftness, the other without - and swapped them based on the fight.... and that she used the swiftness boots far more and was putting it on her next upgrade... that's pretty much my exact sentiment.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Purely for the sake of arguement....<br>
<br>
The implied proof here is that a player that has 'skill' yields better results than a player that has no/less 'skill'. The same is true for 'good' gear vs 'bad' gear. There is no way to meaningfully quantify whether 'skill' (and its implications) are &gt; or &lt; 'gear'. Spec and gear ALWAYS make a difference, as each marginal change in how talent points are spent, or how gear is itemized has a non-zero change on a relevant variable in the game, whether a stat on the stat sheet, DPS, health, etc. (which I guess are all stats on the stat sheet :P). Only reason one might say that these two things 'don't matter' is that they are not quantifiable until 'skill' can be controlled out of the equation...<br>
<br>
Granted this post is more relevent to a thread about raid-leading, but its something good for everyone to be aware of when thinking (incorrectly) that you can compare your dps against anyone else's in the raid (with very specific exceptions).</div>

	</table>
</div>I believe, and I think the post I responded to supports, that a T4 geared character with a reasonably higher level of skill will equally perform, if not outperform, a T5/T6 geared character.  While it's true you can't exactly quantify it, I still will assert (also as a raid leader) that skill is the largest variable in raid performance.  This is assuming that we're talking about "viable" specs and "raid gear", I'm not saying a 0/0/0 kid in greens can outdps a sluggish T6 geared rogue, but I DO think that skill plays a much larger factor than "daggers vs swords", or "T4 vs T5 gear".</div>

<br>
I'm not going to go specifically into the math on run speed, but if you just think logically about it and compare the amount of time you spend moving to your target, to the amount of time you spend dpsing, you can then calculate exactly (theoretically of course) how much dps you gain from the movement speed. Take the total amount of time spent running x.08% to find out how much time that movement speed enchant saves you, and then multiply that by your personal DPS achieved that fight will give you how much more damage you could have done. In most fights it seems incredibly miniscule to me. Although in specific fights like Al'ar the number might be a lot higher, personally I just don't see an incredibly significant value in the runspeed to justify taking the enchant.<br>

		<div id="post_message_514302">Rough numbers on run speed:<br>
<br>
With my current gear, according to the rogue gear sheet, I do 1486.91 DPS.  The loss of 6 agility reduces this to 1482.92.<br>
<br>
Lets assume that without Cat's Swiftness, I spend X seconds out of every minute moving; thus, my damage per minute is (60-X)*1486.91.  With Cat's Swiftness, it would instead be (60-x/1.08)*1482.92.  Equating these and solving for X, we find that the break-even point is at X = 2.1.  So, by this estimate, if you're spending more than 2.1 seconds out of every minute moving, Cat's Swiftness is better.<br>
<br>
In practice, this isn't *quite* a fair estimate, since movement time generally doesn't diminish your yellow DPS, only your white DPS; hence, this calculation should be redone considering only white damage loss.  But this is probably a reasonable estimate to start from.<br>
<br>
So, any fight in which you spend more than 2.1 seconds out of every minute moving favors Cat's Swiftness.  So, for instance, in T5 instances, this would be everything except Tidewalker and, depending on your guild's strategy, Void Reaver; for these instances, Cat's Swiftness is thus fairly clearly superior.  However, the situation is a bit less clear in the T6 instances; I would argue that for Anetheron, Kaz'rogal, Naj'entus, Teron, Gurtogg, and Reliquary there is insufficient running to warrant using Cat's Speed, and there are a few others where it is questionable (Rage Winterchill and Anetheron, for instance) where it doesn't make sense to use Cat's Swiftness from a DPS perspective but one could argue that there's reason to do so from a survival perspective, given that there is AoE to run out of.  Also note that one one of the remaining fights (Shahraz) you will not be wearing your regular boots anyway, so Cat's Swiftness is only the superior choice for your day-to-day boots on 5 out of 13 fights.<br>
<br>
My current solution to this problem is to maintain 2 sets of boots, one with Cat's Swiftness on for movement fights, and one with 12 agi on them for more sustained fights.  This does require one to have access to two reasonably comparable sets of boots, of course, but I do believe it's the right decision in general.<br>
<br>
Regarding Surefooted: the snare break is only useful from a PvE perspective on Vashj, and, in practice, using Vanish/Cloak/Imp Sprint is usually sufficient to stay clear on her.  As such, the only motivation for Surefooted (from a purely PvE standpoint) would be if 10 hit is superior DPS to 12 agi, which is not true for the majority of raid-buffed PvE rogues.<br>
<br>
In brief: 12 agi and Cat's Swiftness are competitive enchants, with each being superior on some fights.  Surefooted is generally inferior from a PvE perspective.</div>

Mutilate cycle: although it was shown in the talent tree, I think special emphasis needs to be put on Ruthlessness.  That extra combo point makes it viable to use a finisher after a single Mutilate, and that's what you want to be doing.  That improves your chance at Relentless Strikes working: your only energy since you don't have Combat Potency.<br>
<br>
If you're doing 2 Mutilates before a finisher (ex: Ruth didn't proc &amp; Mutilate didn't crit), then you're suddenly in the hole energy-wise, and hurting your dps.<br>

</div>Dual Deadly is good in two cases.  One - if the mob has high enough armor that Eviscerates are wasteful.  Two - if the mob can strip poisons.  Good example here is Tidalvess on the Fathom Lord fight.  He can drop Greater Poison Cleansing totems which can mess up your Deadly stacks, and worst case, cause you to briefly lose the Mutilate bonus damage.  Deadly on both weapons keeps it stacked, even though Envenom is not so hot on him.<br>
<br>
You'll always be doing at least some Evisc / Envenom because you generate combo points faster than SnD and Rupture wear off.</div>

<br>
In what sense can you "not afford to give up that 10 hit rating"?  If you will demonstrably do more damage with 12 agi than with 10 hit on your boots, why does it matter what the actual hit rating number is?<br>
<br>
I bring this up purely because it's a common mistake I see people make.  A lot of people are bought into the idea of magic numbers - "I must have 275 hit rating or I'm gimping myself", and the like.  The thing is: there is nothing fundamentally special about being at or near the hit cap.  Hit is a powerful stat, so items that have a lot of it tend to be good, so if you select "good" equipment you will tend to have a lot of hit; however, it is important to remember that what makes the items good is not that they have a lot of hit, but that they generate good DPS output.  Hit is just a number; damage is what matters in the end.  And regardless of your current stats, there always exist tradeoffs.  Even if the Surefooted enchant was the *only* you hit you had, there would exist some amount of AP, Crit, and other stats that would be worth trading it for.  If there was a +1000 AP enchant, would you still feel those 10 points of hit were necessary?  <br>
<br>
Now, this is an extreme example, of course, but it is true that most rogues - and in particular almost all rogues who are optimizing in terms of 25-man raids - will benefit more from 12 agi than 10 hit, and, as such, I would encourage them to not get too fixated on exactly what their hit number is right now and make the superior DPS choice.<br>
<br>
I'm not trying to pick on you, and I'm sorry if it comes across that way.  This is just one of my pet peaves <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302210754im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":)" class="inlineimg">.</div>

I set this magic *never go below this number* for myself at 252 (+16 % hit since we regularly do raid with a moonkin) although i try to shoot higher since imp FF isn't always going to be there for me. (actually clearing up to alar right now with no moonkin)<br>

</div>So, a couple of points here:<br>
<br>
Yes, it's true, every attack that doesn't hit is DPS loss.  But, by the same token, every hit that doesn't crit is damage lost as well.  As is every attack that is made with the opponent being at full mitigation due to lack of armor pen.  As is every attack that doesn't get made due to not stacking haste rating.<br>
<br>
I mean, I see where you're coming from, and it's a totally valid way to look at things... but what's important to remember is that *all* stats increase your DPS, so the relevant question is not *if* you're gaining DPS from stacking that stat, but *how much* DPS you're gaining, and, in turn, *how much* DPS you're losing by not stacking the other available stats.<br>

</div>As a general rule of thumb you want to be socketing with either agi or hit.  There are exceptions, to be sure; but it's a good starting point.  So socketing with Delicate is perfectly valid; socketing with Wicked, less so.<br>

</div>So, to be perfectly technical: 60 hit (or whatever it is) is not a "you must not drop below this line", but a "below this line hit is worth more than it was before, so it takes *even more* other assorted stats in order to make it worth it".<br>
<br>
And to be even more perfectly technical: the amount of difference it makes is actually surprisingly small.  Hit below the yellow hit cap is only worth about 10-15% more than hit above the yellow hit cap.<br>
<br>
Of course, while we're on the topic: it's pretty much impossible to wind up with that little hit without actively trying to, so the distinction is not necessarily relevant.</div>

</div>I'm afraid you just had to hit one of my pet peeves; drawing conclusions based on your performance compared to other rogues in your raids.<br>
<br>
As was repeated earlier in this thread, even subtle differences in play style will make a much larger difference than gemming delicate/wicked over rigid/glinting, etc.<br>
<br>
You may dominate the meters now, but that doesn't mean your +hit tunnel vision is the cause. While their lack of focus on +hit likely contributes to the difference, I would wager that you could further increase the gap by going for dps instead of hit.</div>

You will see what you white damage is, what % miss you have, how much exactly it is hurting your dps, then be able to calculate if the hit will be better or the agi one.

</div>Surprise Attacks guarantees that no finishers can be dodged.<br>
2/2 Quick Recovery means that finishers which fail to hit only cost 20% of their energy.<br>
Finishers are not a factor anyway, with Surprise Attacks you get no benefit from Expertise unless your finishers are in danger of being parried and the energy cost of finishers is small compared to CP generators.<br>
<br>
If you are working on a 0 Energy budget then your next special will come in when you have sufficient energy available.<br>
<br>
One reason for not doing things this way but people often do.<br>
<br>
In this case a dodged/parried CP generator means you have to wait at least one energy tick before you can try the special again. 2 seconds deeper into your DPS cycle.<br>
<br>
Any reduction in dodge rate is useful in that it makes DPS cycles easier to maintain and DPS easier to sustain.<br>
<br>
Blizzard have also introduced a new food buff which gets +20 Hit Rating, this takes some of the pain out of the new hit cap.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">@Vul/rogue community,<br>
<br>
Recently I've been reading everywhere about combat sword dps in comparison to combat dagger dps, and in every comparison drawn swords comes out top hands down. Now when I first saw these posts popping up on the official rogue forums about everyone turning to swords I stuck it through with daggers, as generally I don't beleive anything on those BS forums. <br>
<br>
I am not benign to the fact that on paper swords &gt; daggers (combat) and will not flat out deny objective truths. However the amount of dps I still produce easily equals the other two combat rogues in my guild (who are both swords).

(I would appreciate no commenting about improving my current stats - I know 306 +hit is far from optimal with the amount of AP I have, but there are some major upgrades in store so right now there would be no use in re-socketing my gear accordingly as I usually do if I receive upgrades).<br>
<br>
So I am just inquiring as to WHY combat daggers is such a no go for most people, even in mid-high end BT? In my experience it's as viable as combat swords.<br>
<br>
Thanks in advance for answers,<br>

P.S. Sorry for taking it slightly off topic, but I thought posting a new thread about this is pointless.</div>

You right, i think the hype about swords make people think that swords is WAY better then daggers. But if you take the numbers of the first page for example, saying swords is 5% more dps then daggers it equals to 1050 dps for a swordrogue if the daggers holds 1000 dps. So in reality the differents is not much. Ofcourse if the rogue got the warglaives its another story, but then again there are no comparable daggers <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302201821im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":)" class="inlineimg"></div>

		<div id="post_message_515007">Looking at a few of these new Subtlety changes, is it possible now that dagger rogues may end up being able to output more DPS?  With Dirty Deeds changes (20% more damage against targets below 35% health) and Shadowstep able to be used while out of stealth, there is a possibility of generating a solid amount of damage.

		<div id="post_message_515015">I've been thinking about what precisely to put in the mechanics section, and here's a little thought I had with regard to cooldown syncing and its effect on DPS. Assume ability A with cooldown C(A) and ability B with cooldown C(B) = k*C(A), for some real value k &gt; 1. Either k is an integer (e.g. C(A) = 2 min and C(B) = 4 min, so k = 2) or k is not an integer (e.g. C(A) = 2 min and C(B) = 3 min, so k = 1.5).<br>
<br>
Additionally, assume there are three possible strategies:<br>
<br>
1) We use both cooldowns on cooldown.<br>
2) We use A on cooldown, but hold off on B until the next time A is available.<br>
3) We use B on cooldown, but hold off on A until the next time B is available.<br>
<br>
If k is an integer, our calculations are very simple. Since C(B) is a multiple of C(A), ability A will always be available when B becomes available. Thus:<br>
<br>
1) If we use both abilities on cooldown, we can consider a timeframe of length C(B). Over this timeframe, we will use A exactly k times, and B exactly once. The cooldowns will sync up exactly once.<br>
<br>
2) If we hold off on B until A becomes available, that won't change anything, since A is always available when B becomes available.<br>
<br>
3) If we hold off on A until B becomes available, trivially, this will be inferior. Rather than being used k times in C(B), A will be used only once. B will still be used once. The abilities will still sync up once.<br>
<br>
Thus, when k is an integer, it is obvious that strategy 1/2 is best.<br>
<br>
If k is not an integer, our calculations become slightly less simple. However, we can take a timeframe of C(A)*C(B). Over this time, we know that the abilities will sync up a number of times equal to the greatest common factor between C(A) and C(B) (e.g. if C(A) = 6 and C(B) = 9, greatest common factor is 3, C(A)*C(B) = 54, so they will sync up 3 times in 54 minutes).<br>
<br>
1) If we use both abilities on cooldown, we can consider a timeframe of C(A)*C(B)/gcf. Over this timeframe, we will use A exactly C(B)/gcf times, and B exactly C(A)/gcf times. The abilities will sync up once.<br>
<br>
2) If we hold off on B until A becomes available, then we can consider a timeframe of ceil(k)*C(A). Over this timeframe, we will use A exactly ceil(k) times, and B exactly once. The abilities will sync up once.<br>
<br>
3) If we hold off on A until B becomes available, then we can consider a timeframe of C(B), or k*C(A). Over this timeframe, we will use A exactly once, and B exactly once. The abilities will sync up once.<br>
<br>
Here it is less obvious which is best. First, we must compare strategy 2 to strategy 3. Strategy 2 has a ratio of usage of ability A to time equal to ceil(k)/(ceil(k)*C(A)) = 1/C(A). Strategy 3's same ratio is 1/(k*C(A)). Since k &gt; 1, strategy 2's ratio is greater. However, strategy 2 has a syncing ratio of 1/(ceil(k)*C(A)), while 3's ratio is 1/(k*C(A)); since k is not an integer, ceil(k) &gt; k, therefore strategy 3's ratio is greater. Let the DPS increase factor of a cooldown be quantified by I(x). The DPS change going from strategy 2 to strategy 3 is:<br>
<br>
I(A)/(k*C(A)) - I(A)/C(A) + I(A)*I(B)/(k*C(A)) - I(A)*I(B)/(ceil(k)*C(A)) =<br>
(I(A) + I(A)*I(B))/(k*C(A)) - I(A)/C(A) - I(A)*I(B)/(ceil(k)*C(A)) =<br>
1 + I(B) - 1 - k*I(B)/ceil(k) &lt;  (note that k/ceil(k) &lt; 1 by definition if k is not an integer)<br>
I(B) - I(B) = 0<br>
<br>
The DPS change is less than zero; in other words, by switching from strategy 2 to strategy 3, you will always lose DPS. Now we want to figure out how strategy 1 compares to strategy 2. First, we can trivially find that A is used with a ratio of 1/C(A), and B with a ratio of 1/(k*C(A)). Note that strategy 2's ratio for A was also 1/C(A), and its ratio for B was 1/(ceil(k)*C(A)). However, 1's ratio of syncing the cooldowns is gcf/(C(A)*C(B)). This makes for a slightly more complicated analysis. The DPS change going from strategy 1 to strategy 2 is:<br>
<br>
I(A)/C(A) - I(A)/C(A) + I(B)/(ceil(k)*C(A)) - I(B)/(k*C(A)) + I(A)*I(B)/(ceil(k)*C(A)) - I(A)*I(B)*gcf/(C(A)*C(B)) =<br>
I(B)/ceil(k) - I(B)/k + I(A)*I(B)/ceil(k) - I(A)*I(B)*gcf/C(B) =<br>
(1 + I(A))/ceil(k) - 1/k - I(A)*gcf/C(B) =<br>
k*(1 + I(A))/ceil(k) - 1 - k*I(A)*gcf/C(B) &lt;<br>
I(A) - k*I(A)*gcf/C(B)<br>
<br>
The DPS change going from strategy 1 to strategy 2 must be less than this given quantity. Thus, if we set this quantity equal to zero, we can find the conditions under which strategy 1 must be better than strategy 2.<br>
<br>
I(A) - k*I(A)*gcf/C(B) = 0<br>
I(A) = k*I(A)*gcf/C(B)<br>
1 = k*gcf/k*C(A)<br>
1 = gcf/C(A)<br>
C(A) = gcf<br>
<br>
If C(A) is a common factor between C(A) and C(B), then C(B) must be a multiple of C(A). Note that this is not a contradiction of our assumptions; rather, this is simply using the general case to illustrate what we already proved above when discussing integer values of k.<br>
<br>
If C(A) is not the greater common factor between C(A) and C(B), we cannot actually make any general-case guarantees about strategy 1 versus strategy 2. If C(A) != gcf (and therefore C(A) &gt; gcf), then strategy 2 might be better than strategy 1. If C(A) = gcf, then strategy 1 must be better.<br>

</div>You should check the DPS&amp;Gear Spreadsheets on this same forum. <br>
Anyway, just to save you some time, fist+sword would give you SLIGHTLY more dps at the cost of 5talent points. On my current setup I go from 1550 to 1555 dps, which is hardly noticeable. <br>
At the sametime I'm an avid pvper so my combat builds include extra toys like blade twisting or improved kick, so fist+sword is a no-no for me.<br>
Up to you :-)</div>

</div>So, the problem is that in order to get even Dirty Deeds one needs to spec fairly deep in Hemo, meaning you need to sacrifice either assassination or high-end combat, both of which hurt a *lot*.  And this is doubly true for Shadowstep.  I don't expect those talents to be sufficiently powerful to justify the loss of DPS through other talents for a dagger build.<br>
<br>
In fact, I think the big winner in the subtlety changes is... sword builds (shockingly enough).  Combat Hemo (11/26/24 and it's ilk) will be the major benefactors of such a change.  They will still do less total DPS than Combat, but when you factor in the Hemo debuff it is sufficient to justify a raid slot.<br>

</div>Oddly, this is somewhat reversed now.  In purely sustained fights where swords can maintain cycles like 3s5r and keep very high rupture uptime, they blow past daggers.  It is in interrupted fights where swords have a hard time maintaining tight cycles that daggers have the ability to compete, as dagger builds are much less reliant on rupture and much more reliant on simply keeping SnD up and backstabbing. Hence, to the extent a dagger rogue is going to be able to keep up at all, it's going to be on trash and interrupted fights, not on purely sustained fights.  Which is exactly reversed from what it was pre-BC, but that's the way it goes.</div>

</div>I have ever since been on Combat Daggers until the start of S2, I changed to Maces for more Arena viabilty then. On raids without t4, having no t5 4 bonus yet, the cycle 3s/5r worked for me fine there.<br>
Now I am back to daggers again, still searching for the perfect cycle, and I have to confess that 5s/5r never works out for me, after 5s building up cps again I have about ~7 to 8s left until snd runs out, so it probably is about 5s/2r at max for me, even having t5 4bonus now.<br>

I spent some time in deep sub in ZA on the PTR.  My gear isn't outstanding (hitcap, T4, properly enchanted/socketed etc) and I wasn't in a stacked DPS group, but i was doing considerably better damage as sub-daggers than I was as combat daggers.  Specifically, I found that premed-&gt;garrote-&gt;rupture-&gt;relentless-&gt;1cp snd was a great opener, and generally followed up by backstab spam, with an occassional hemo or shiv to quickly hit 5cp ruptures.<br>
<br>
Also, I macro'ed shadowstep into my backstab spam, so that I would use it (and its associated aggro reduction) every time it was up.  It essentially worked like free feint.  (i.e., /cast shadowstep /stopcasting /cast backstab).<br>
<br>
<br>
So, anecdotally, yes, maybe there is a place for shs daggers in raiding.  Lets see what the yet-to-be-announced hemo buff looks like?  If they find a way to make it more dagger friendly, they we may have a serious contender.  I would love it if they 1.) had hemo increase dot damage, 2.) made it into a more stackable buff;  so, instead of just refreshing the count, 3 hemos would leave 90 charges of the debuff on the target.</div>

I find the problems with Dagger builds on trash are the same as before and that Swords has reached at least parity with Daggers on bosses. Mind you I freely admit that issues with gear in the Raids I take part in distort what I am seeing and I have not taken these into account.<br>
What I am seeing on trash is that Sword Rogues with worse gear than me in chaotic fights/small trash are out DPSing me, on bosses and big trash I am leaving them far behind.<br>
With sword rogues of equal gear I tend compete on even terms on bosses only.<br>
A lot of this could be down to me not trying so hard on smaller trash though.<br>
<br>
I am a Combat Dagger Rogue, I am impatiently waiting a decent sword drop so I can respec. I am even contemplating PvP to get my weapons that way and I hate PvP with a vengeance. Sorry, I am boring people with my life story :/<br>
<br>
@Talda:<br>
I have the 4 set T4 bonus, I am not Ruthlessness specced (should be) but I find that a 1s/3s/5r cycle is still easy to maintain.<br>
Respeccing to 3/3 Ruthlessness 4/5 Lethality should make 1s/3r easier. Doing so makes better use of the 4 set bonus, it hardly features otherwise.</div>

</div>3/3 Imp FF gives 3% hit.<br>
2/2 Weapon Expertise was equivalent to 10 Weapon Skill, roughly 3.5% hit.<br>
New Hit Cap is 363 Hit Rating, Hit Rating to Hit% conversion at level 70 is 15.8 = 1% Hit.<br>
3 * 15.8 = 47.4. Round that down, decimals make arithmetic so ugly<br>
<br>
363 - 47 = 316<br>
<br>
Chuck in the new food buff and you have a hit cap of 296, with a Draenei Warrior in your party you get 281.<br>
<br>
Of course to check my figures you may have to search for Imp FF on these forums and read the Weapon Expertise threads.</div>

Any of these comparisons are only meangingful in ideal circumstances and that means never take the results literally.<br>

Stupidly enough it is the Arena OH weapons which bring Swords up, the only other OH sword available before Mount Hyjal, Latros, hardly compares.<br>
<br>
I suspect Blizzard were balancing things via itemisation but screwed up royally with Arena PvP items. In more ways than one as well.<br>
<br>
It is remarkable that Dagger itemisation continues to be superior in PvE and that if it weren't for Arena gear Combat Daggers would still be the best Raiding spec purely because of that. Well until BT perhaps.<br>
<br>
I wonder what the effect of fast high quality OH swords would have had in Vanilla WoW if they were more generally available before Naxx. I do not include Maladath in the fast bracket compared to what you can get now although it was a tasty OH way back when.<br>

<br>
The reason you should pick dagger over sword even if swords has higher dps is simple because its 10 times more fun, atleast for me. The only thing i wanted to say was that people seems to choice swords over other speccs because of the "awesome" dps instead of asking themself what<br>
they think is fun. If nihilum had dagger rogues when they took illidan world first, its good enough dps for me atleast <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304035832im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/biggrin.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":D" class="inlineimg"></div>

		<div id="post_message_517104">I believe that, over the next day or two, I'll begin updating the first post with some preliminary 2.3 information. So far what we have is a pretty good chunk (if not all) of the new items that will be available, a new weapon enchant on which I feel like I need more data before I can reach any conclusions, and of course, the expertise change, for which we're sort of relying on the assumption that Blizzard isn't changing the base miss rate against a raid boss. If they're not, the 363 hit cap holds. Otherwise, who knows.<br>
<br>
Everything will go in a separate section near the top, since it's what people seem to want to know about lately, and none of it is considered final yet. As always, please double check anything I post for accuracy.<br>
<br>
Regarding the 5% DPS difference with daggers: I caution everyone not to get too caught up in numbers like that. Such a number is, by necessity, an approximation. Swords, daggers, fists, and maces all scale slightly differently with gear; as a result, the difference will vary slightly. 5% difference assumes a particular level of gear (I believe I did that comparison using the same assumed T4 level of gear I used for the stat weights) that certainly may not be true for everyone. That's why I always stress double-checking any "rule" given here with the spreadsheets.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Well if you play 10 min, 50 more dps is 30k damage. And 30k in 10 min is not much imo <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304035832im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":)" class="inlineimg"><br>
<br>
The reason you should pick dagger over sword even if swords has higher dps is simple because its 10 times more fun, atleast for me. The only thing i wanted to say was that people seems to choice swords over other speccs because of the "awesome" dps instead of asking themself what<br>
they think is fun. If nihilum had dagger rogues when they took illidan world first, its good enough dps for me atleast <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304035832im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/biggrin.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":D" class="inlineimg"></div>

</div>In a rogue theorycraft thread, the entire idea is maximizing your damage by understanding the supporting math. Choosing not to for fun is fine, knock yourself out. But it does sort of defeat the purpose of a thread centered on, as stated above, maximizing your damage.<br>
<br>
For any rogue who takes the current spreadsheets as valid, daggers does less damage then swords - end of story. This doesn't say daggers doesn't do "enough" damage, however. It simply says swords does more, by however small/large a margin your spec/gear/playstyle creates.<br>
<br>
and the 5% thing wasn't something I was taking as gospel -- I responded to a post that used it, and I was just making my point referencing it.</div>

</div>Personally, I never Shiv to save DP stacks, but I've never actually done any math to support my practice. So here comes some math:<br>
<br>
Looking at my handy spreadsheet here, I can see that over any given span of 12 seconds, I have roughly a 4% chance not to proc DP. So let's assume that means I have a 4% chance to need to Shiv every 12 seconds. Let's completely ignore any other ramifications with respect to my cycle. This means that on average, I'll Shiv once every 300 seconds.<br>
<br>
Using my current gear, <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304035832/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=30082"><span  ><span class="purplename">[Talon of Azshara]</span></span></a> and <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304035832/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=32027"><span  ><span class="purplename">[Merciless Gladiator's Quickblade]</span></span></a>, my SS damage is roughly 1184, while my Shiv damage is roughly 426. So let's say I'm trading exactly one Sinister Strike for one Shiv every 300 seconds to keep DP up 100% of the time. That's 758 damage given up every 300 seconds.<br>
<br>
Now, with my current gear assuming never Shivving, DP deals about 72 DPS. If I increase my DP uptime to exactly 100%, the DPS increases by 3.36. Over 300 seconds, that's an increase of roughly 1007 damage. This assumes 3/5 Vile Poisons. With 0/5 Vile Poisons, it's 899 damage.<br>
<br>
So, if you <i>only</i> Shiv in the case where DP is in imminent danger of falling off, then you will gain approximately 0.5-1 DPS. In my opinion, this isn't even remotely worth the kind of micromanagement it would take to make sure you're only Shivving when you aren't going to get a proc and that you always have the GCD to Shiv at that last possible second to refresh the stack.<br>
<br>
In other words, never Shiv. Ever. If you need to get SnD up quickly at the start of the fight, use a 1-2 CP SnD before starting your normal cycle. Don't Shiv for it. The speedier gain in CP is nowhere near worth the loss of DPS.<br>

</div>Windfury is definitely still better for you, but definitely by a much smaller margin than it used to be. My spreadsheet gives me about a 12 DPS loss switching from WF to GoA+IP. Rule of thumb: if there's a warrior in that group at all, you should have your shaman dropping WF. You also want that warrior in the group because Battle Shout is a gigantic DPS increase, particularly if talented. The feral druid is probably the most dispensable member of the group, so if you need to choose, go with enhance shaman + rogues + fury warrior and have the shaman drop WF. If the group doesn't have a fury warrior (e.g. enhance shaman + feral druid + 3 rogues), then dropping GoA might be better for the group overall.</div>

The biggest DPS buffs for a combat build are Battle Shout (5/5 improved), Unleashed Rage, Blessing of Might (5/5 improved), Grace of Air/Windfury (see further below), Leader of the Pack, in that order. If your raid is short on paladins, Salvation &gt; Might &gt; Kings.

				<div style="font-style:italic"><b>On poisons and Windfury:</b> for PvE, always choose DP on the offhand. If you are in a group with a shaman and you're combat, you'll generally get more DPS from Windfury as opposed to Grace of Air + IP. However, the difference is not as dramatic as it is for, say, a DPS warrior. If your group contains a DPS warrior, Windfury Totem will usually be dropped. Otherwise, if less than half the group is rogues, Grace of Air Totem will probably be dropped and you should use IP on the MH. Always check with the shaman in your group. For Mutilate, Grace of Air Totem is probably preferable, but Windfury Totem is still quite powerful. Note that dual DP is a waste for all builds except Mutilate, and only if you use Envenom.</div>

</div>I can see using Shiv to reapply DP if it prevents the stack from falling off, as DP falling off is a Very Bad Thing. However, I don't see how Shiv'ing at the start of combat gets SnD off any 'faster'. As I understand it*, SS and Shiv invoke the same GCD, and both award one CP with which to get SND up, which I understand are the only factors that affect how fast SnD can be used. If Shiv and SS are equal in this regard (getting SnD up), you should use whichever skill is higher DPS (or DPE or whatever).<br>
<br>
* My conclusion here admittedly is not ironclad, as I am not an expert rogue. (I'm still leveling her, and thus still learning the ins and outs of roguery.) My conclusions, like any good conclusion, is based off assumptions. If my assumptions are valid, then my conclusion is valid (read as: use SS, not Shiv at the start). If I am somehow misinformed on my assumptions, please let me know, as I enjoy learning...</div>

<br>
No it really isn't so terrible. It doesn't happen often and when it does it'll be back soon. All the models assume that deadly poison will do a certain amount of dps based on how often it's applied and its damage value.<br>
<br>
You don't need to break the cycle to reapply DP as was demonstrated above (it might provide some infinitesimal dps boost but for most of us at the cost of our rhythm). <br>
<br>
As for shiv-ing early, shiv requires a lot less energy than SS does. So if you are obsesses about getting SnD up -- and as the fight goes this is the thing you *must* have up at all times -- then you can shiv your way to some combo pts and SnD with more time on the counter faster than you can do the same with SS. I suppose it depends on your cycle and how you many CP is normal for you before you SnD. If it's a higher number, this might make sense with the proviso that it's still out of rhythm: First pass, 4x shiv, SnD, start real cycle vs. First pass, &lt;normal SS, SnD, start real cycle.</div>

</div>Do you have Salvation on you when doing that?<br>
<br>
Salvation is obviously not quantifiable, but it has huge intangible value. On Hydross, Leotheras, Lurker, and Al'ar, at the very least, Salvation has great benefit due to threat wipes or having to DPS adds quickly without pulling aggro on them. Additionally, on Morogrim and Void Reaver, it's easily possible to have threat issues as your gear scales up (since tank threat scales slower than DPS). On Vashj, I would consider Vanishing for threat a liability, since you never know when you may need it on phase 3 to escape being rooted in toxic spores.<br>

</div>Perhaps your tanks are better than the ones I've dealt with, but having played with about 5 different tanks in two different guilds, in most cases I'm generating 90% (or more) of the aggro of the tank even with salvation on.  Without salvation, then, I'd be generating something like 125% of his aggro, and thereby would need to spend a lot of time holding back to avoid pulling aggro, even with vanish.  Consider: it's 5 minutes between vanishes.  If one is dealing 125% of the aggro of the tank, it takes the tank 6.25 minutes to generate this much aggro.  Hence, your first vanish would need to occur 75 seconds into the fight to avoid pulling aggro before the 2nd vanish.  Thus, one would need to spend the first 75 seconds of the fight dealing less than 80% of your damage potential, which is just a huge waste of damage.  Also, there's more potential for accidentally pulling aggro, which is usual fatal and thus an even larger loss of DPS.<br>

I'm not going to say that there aren't combinations of really good tanks and undergeared rogues that render salvation unnecessary; but I do think the general rule that salvation is the most important rogue buff is correct.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Perhaps your tanks are better than the ones I've dealt with, but having played with about 5 different tanks in two different guilds, in most cases I'm generating 90% (or more) of the aggro of the tank even with salvation on.  Without salvation, then, I'd be generating something like 125% of his aggro, and thereby would need to spend a lot of time holding back to avoid pulling aggro, even with vanish.  Consider: it's 5 minutes between vanishes.  If one is dealing 125% of the aggro of the tank, it takes the tank 6.25 minutes to generate this much aggro.  Hence, your first vanish would need to occur 75 seconds into the fight to avoid pulling aggro before the 2nd vanish.

Salvation is obviously not quantifiable, but it has huge intangible value. On Hydross, Leotheras, Lurker, and Al'ar, at the very least, Salvation has great benefit due to threat wipes or having to DPS adds quickly without pulling aggro on them. Additionally, on Morogrim and Void Reaver, it's easily possible to have threat issues as your gear scales up (since tank threat scales slower than DPS). On Vashj, I would consider Vanishing for threat a liability, since you never know when you may need it on phase 3 to escape being rooted in toxic spores.</div>

Yeah, I can see salv very useful in all of those fights with adds/threat wipes. (We just did our first attempts on Lootreaver this week and once we get it down I'll definitely be needing salv )<br>

I'm hoping that I've been doing fine from having a tank that can threat well instead of a lack in my part, haha.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Windfury is definitely still better for you, but definitely by a much smaller margin than it used to be. My spreadsheet gives me about a 12 DPS loss switching from WF to GoA+IP. Rule of thumb: if there's a warrior in that group at all, you should have your shaman dropping WF. You also want that warrior in the group because Battle Shout is a gigantic DPS increase, particularly if talented. The feral druid is probably the most dispensable member of the group, so if you need to choose, go with enhance shaman + rogues + fury warrior and have the shaman drop WF. If the group doesn't have a fury warrior (e.g. enhance shaman + feral druid + 3 rogues), then dropping GoA might be better for the group overall.</div>

</div>Even at 2000 DPS, a 2% DPS gain is 40. This is roughly on par with what I get from Leader of the Pack right now at 1400 DPS. Still, I wouldn't mind taking the ret paladin over the feral druid in my ideal group, given that the feral druid doesn't benefit at all from WF, and the ret paladin does.<br>
<br>
Regarding not having a second (or third) rogue in there, I understand that other rogues offer nothing to you, but unless you're running a raid with only one rogue, there are going to be other rogues around, and they need a group. I'm willing to venture that it's a far bigger loss of DPS to shove a second rogue into some suboptimal group just so that you can get all the DPS boosts you want.<br>
<br>
I would argue against the inclusion of a BM hunter in this melee group. Although I love Ferocious Inspiration as much as anyone else, all the BM hunter is getting here is Battle Shout and Imp Sanc Aura. I was under the impression that BM hunters were preferred for caster groups with shadow priests anyway. If not, I stand corrected.</div>

</div>This is true if you only have one rogue in your raid, but with multiple rogues, the benefit the raid gains from giving them all (at minimum) an Enhancement Shaman and Warrior with Imp BS is going to be better than stacking one super-dps group and leaving the other rogues to slum it up in a leftover group.<br>
<br>
In my guild, at least, we usually only raid with one Enhancement Shaman and 2-3 rogues. Usually we toss all three in one group with the Sham and one of the DPS Warrs; if we swapped one of the BM hunters in there, the other four get the bonus from FI, but it's not nearly enough to make up for the other rogue losing BS, UR, and possibly WF.</div>

</div>You're just stubbornly holding onto some notion that daggers really is better and it's just these weird "quirks" that are causing people to go swords when supposedly, everyone really wants to be daggers or something.

				<div style="font-style:italic">You're just stubbornly holding onto some notion that daggers really is better and it's just these weird "quirks" that are causing people to go swords when supposedly, everyone really wants to be daggers or something.   Swords are numerically (at least at current T4+ raid target levels) superior, and the reasons for it are NOT due to itemization, nor due to encounter types, it's due to game mechanics - they may change in the future (as they have in the past), but CURRENTLY swords are stronger, not by a huge margin, but enough to matter to some people.</div>

</div>Well, I think his assertion was that the availability of good, fast OH swords via PvP are making swords stronger than they otherwise might be, which is true.  However, you are correct in that this effect is not large enough to matter; even without the availability of PvP weapons, sworrds would be superior.  For instance, according the Rogue Gear Spreadsheet: with my current gear and typical raid buffs, I would do as much damage with Talon of Azshara/Latro's as I would with Shard of Azzinoth/Messenger of Fate (the optimal daggers for combat daggers) - even against targets where Murder does not apply.  And when one can match the damage output of the best daggers in the game with an early SSC drop and a blue from a non-heroic 5 man, that's a pretty good indicator that daggers are a bit weak right now.</div>

<br>
Also, I want to come clearly out and say that I don't believe that this disparity is "right" or imply that swords are inherently better and should remain that way - I honestly think that when you're talking about deep combat, they should be as close as possible, and I certainly wouldn't begrudge daggers a slight buff to make them closer.<br>
<br>
That being said, I honestly can't remember a time when they were closer - I'm pretty sure that by mid-Naxx, your combat dagger builds were more than 5% better than a sword build with an equal gear level.  But I'll admit that's just conjecture.</div>

		<div id="post_message_517846">Well, the complication in Naxx was the lack of swords; until one killed Kel'thuzad, there wasn't a single MH sword available that did more than 58.5 DPS, whereas Rag dropped a dagger that did that much and there were 3 viable MH Daggers over 60 DPS in AQ40 and the early parts of Naxx - so it tended to be the case in Naxx that dagger rogues had higher DPS MH weapons than did sword rogues, hence their DPS tends to be higher.  My sense is that when you did actually have sword rogues with weapons of comparable quality, the difference was probably of equal magnitude; there was simply an itemization gap that made it appear larger.</div>

		<div id="post_message_517858">I still maintain that offhand sword spec needs to be changed to proc an extra offhand attack. Even if it does, sword spec still scales beyond any other spec once you have high levels of crit and hit. However, changing offhand sword spec will increase the competitiveness of other weapon specs. The primary downside of doing this would be that */sword hybrid specs would lose a lot of their competitiveness. However, without a change like this, sword spec will continue to be far too powerful for its own good, and the only fix would be to make the other specs equally overpowered.</div>

		<div id="post_message_517877">I agree that some way of equalizing the specs is probably needed.  The most likely options would seem to be:<br>
<br>
1) OH Sword hits proc OH attacks<br>
2) Internal cooldown on Sword Spec (as is true of Windfury Weapon for shamans)<br>
3) Reinstatement of the previous sword spec mechanic, wherein Sword Spec procs reset the MH swing timer.<br>
<br>
Any of these would do nicely in bringing the specs back towards balance; the fact that they would nerf hybrid xxx/sword specs is not really that big a deal; they would be replaced with nonhybrid specs.  For instance, hybrid fist/sword spec would be replaced with fist/fist spec; instead of using Talon of the Phoenix/Quickblade, you'd use Talon of the Phoenix/Claw of the Phoenix.<br>
<br>
The issue that I would be concerned about with such a change is that it would effectively be a blanket rogue nerf; as most raiding rogues are swords right now, this would work out to a 5% reduction in rogue DPS for the majority of raiders.  Particularly since the recent rogue nerfs (to Haste Rating, Dragonspine Trophy, Weapon Skill, etc.) I fear that such a change would drop rogues dangerously low in DPS output, to the extent that our value in a raid would be called into question.  As such, while I do feel that a weapon specialization rebalancing is needed, I think it also needs to be accompanied with balance tweaks in other areas to help rogues maintain they're value to 25-man raids.</div>

				Stat weighting depends heavily on the stats a character already possesses. The following general guidelines are based roughly on a projected tier 4 level of gear (Kara/Gruul/Mag/world bosses). These guidelines work by comparing the amount of DPS provided by any one stat to the amount of DPS provided by a point of Attack Power:<br>
<br>
1 Strength = 1 AP (1.1 with Kings)<br>
1 Agility = 2 AP (2.2 with Kings)<br>
1 Crit Rating = 1.6 AP<br>
1 Hit Rating = 2.3 AP<br>
4 Armor Penetration = 1 AP<br>
1 Haste Rating = 2.3 AP
			
		</td>

	</table>
</div>What I might be more specifically asking is, what was the testing method to arrive at these figures, how much are these numbers rounded, et cetera. Obviously as the spreadsheets imply, which stat is more valuable depends on where your character is already sitting. But if you were to make a spreadsheet that just broke down every piece of gear, and said Gear(A) is superior to Gear(B) in a vacuum, you have to start with these base numbers.<br>

[edit] Yes I know of the shadow panther website, but even he has 3 different formulas for what exactly AEP is. I'm not claiming the numbers are wrong, I'd just like to look at the formula, especially with the hit cap changing, and see where the formula is. And also because I see a lot of rogues sitting well below the hit cap and doing just fine on DPS.</div>

</div>I suppose using the word "overpowered" was a tad inaccurate. If rogue damage falls behind that of classes that bring more than just damage to raids (read: most other classes), then we've got a balance issue. However, there's definitely an issue within the scope of the class itself if the spec with least utility other than in raids doesn't do the most damage (or even tie for the most damage).<br>
<br>
I wouldn't mind seeing one or more of the weapon specs changed to 1/2/3/4/5% haste. That would scale much better relative to sword spec.</div>

		<div id="post_message_517970">The difficulty with "buffing the others to match" is the *way* in which Swords are overpowered.  The problem is not that swords are too strong in general; on the MH, sword spec is well-balanced against the other two specs; it's a bit weaker than fist at low gear levels, a bit strong at high gear levels, a little worse than mace for PvP, and a bit better than mace for PvE.  The problem is that sword spec on the offhand is about 3 times as good as any of the other specs on the offhand.  Thus, the naive solution of just bumping fist spec up to 1.5% crit per level doesn't work; all that would do is make fist/sword hybrid spec more powerful, and you still have the fundamental issue that everyone wants to offhand a sword.  If it were just a case that "swords in general are too strong", it'd be easy to fix by buffing the others.  Since the problem is that "OH Swords are too powerful", it's harder to fix without nerfing sword spec.</div>

I can only imagine that the guild which doesn't need salvation on rogues has exceptionally good tanks generated exceptionally good threat or rogues not generating the dps they ought to be.<br>

Another "must have salv" fight is Void Reaver.. And really the list of "must have salv" fights is pretty much the vast majority of them if not all of them.<br>

"Mideci vanish now or you're gonna be tanking soon" is not uncommon. And again our tanks are pretty darned solid and I'm hardly the greatest rogue in WoW.</div>

</div>According to that rogue's own guide, he does not like theorycraft. Personally, I don't like relying on empirical data. His opinions and those of the majority of the rogues on this forum disagree in several ways, and I would venture that most of ours here are based on solid math, while his are based on intuition and feel (which certainly counts for something, but just being in Nihilum doesn't make one <i>right</i>).<br>

I would leave it up to you to decide which to put more stock in. For what it's worth, I don't believe the weighting of stats changes very much between daggers and swords, though if I'm wrong hopefully someone will correct me here.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Even at 2000 DPS, a 2% DPS gain is 40. This is roughly on par with what I get from Leader of the Pack right now at 1400 DPS. Still, I wouldn't mind taking the ret paladin over the feral druid in my ideal group, given that the feral druid doesn't benefit at all from WF, and the ret paladin does.<br>
<br>
Regarding not having a second (or third) rogue in there, I understand that other rogues offer nothing to you, but unless you're running a raid with only one rogue, there are going to be other rogues around, and they need a group. I'm willing to venture that it's a far bigger loss of DPS to shove a second rogue into some suboptimal group just so that you can get all the DPS boosts you want.<br>
<br>
I would argue against the inclusion of a BM hunter in this melee group. Although I love Ferocious Inspiration as much as anyone else, all the BM hunter is getting here is Battle Shout and Imp Sanc Aura. I was under the impression that BM hunters were preferred for caster groups with shadow priests anyway. If not, I stand corrected.</div>

The healing from Judgement of Light (?) in certain encounters, Hydross in either Phase, Lurker etc, is significant and frees healers up from having to constantly watch over melee. It does not replace it but it makes it easier on them.<br>

Having the melee DPS in one group has other benefits.<br>
<br>
2 Rogues, BM Hunter, Warrior, Enhancement Shaman in one group is more convenient in the Raid and means that more advantage is taken of the buffs available.<br>
<br>
@Shaker with respect to Sword Spec up to 2.1. The bug only caused the damage caused by OH procs to reset the MH swing, this was not a reduction of DPS by half, it was a reduction of DPS from those OH procs by half, that was not major and not a reason to stay away from sword spec.<br>
<br>
Also I am not sticking to the belief that Combat Daggers is better. I have not been saying that either. What I have been saying is that IF the only weapons we had available were from PvE then Daggers would not be at the disadvantage it is currently at.<br>
Sword itemisation compared to Dagger itemisation until MH/BT in PvE stinks.<br>
Fist is worse until SSC and Maces, well Mace Spec in a Raid is fine until the mobs are stunnable. I will resist a rant on that subject.<br>
<br>
The word "overpowered" has been used together with Sword Spec. As other have said this is an exaggeration. I think Sword Spec, in terms of DPS, is where the other specs -should- be with the exception of Mace Spec. Must.. resist.. the... rant: Mace Spec has no place in Raids, stunned mobs are a pain for the tanks to have to deal with.<br>
<br>
Having Sword Spec cause procs to cause an extra swing for the weapon that procced would balance things out.<br>
<br>
I would -love- to see Opportunity changed to give Haste at 1/2/3/4/5% and have the dmg buff built into the skills that are currently buffed by it. Oh and dump Aggression, make Vitality more effective.<br>
<br>
In terms of playability -every- other usual build is better than combat daggers. Well possibly not Shadowstep. It is the playability aspect which is why I am going Combat Swords. I must be too old to have grasped this earlier. Mind you I was seduced by Mutilate, Blizzard have dropped the ball on that Talent so no point crying over spilled milk.</div>

</div>I understand the concept of an "ideal" group, but your ideal group doesn't really have a purpose in discussion if it has nothing to do with reality. I would define "ideal" as the group I would put together in an actual raid, with the success of the raid in mind, if I had all the parts available to do it. Also, I don't understand why you would say "having the melee DPS in one group has other benefits" (on which I don't disagree) and then shove a BM hunter in the group. Finally, last nitpick, Judgment of Light is usable and affects you whether the ret paladin is in your group or not. However, as I said, I wouldn't mind trading the feral druid for the paladin at all.<br>

</div>Yes, and this is what Shaker is trying to tell you simply isn't correct. Itemization doesn't have the least bit to do with it. Go ahead and whip out your copy of Aldriana's gear spreadsheet, and do the following comparison: <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304051226/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=29124"><span  ><span class="purplename">[Vindicator's Brand]</span></span></a>+<a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304051226/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=28189"><span  ><span class="bluename">[Latro's Shifting Sword]</span></span></a> vs. <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304051226/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=32471"><span  ><span class="purplename">[Shard of Azzinoth]</span></span></a>+<a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304051226/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=32269"><span  ><span class="purplename">[Messenger of Fate]</span></span></a>.

What's number 2 depends on your spec and gear to some extent, but generally the answer is either Ashtongue Talisman of Lethality, Madness of the Betrayer, or Warp Spring Coil.

		<div id="post_message_522050">I wonder, has anyone researched or modeled effects of crit over hit for Mutilate builds?<br>
Seeing how Vashj has been very uncooperative in regards of the belt I was starting to consider Don Alejandro's over my current Belt of Deep Shadows.<br>
Common sense tells me that Deep Shadows is superior (dps wise), but I began wondering if crit might be better for Mutilate due to it's "2" attack nature, or where the cut-off point would be?<br>
<br>
From what I understand Mutilate is a two-roll (or is it rather one+two roll system?)<br>
First to check if the attack lands and two "secondary" rolls to check if the attacks are either crits or hits.<br>
<br>
Assuming that the only "procs" are Mongoose (WSC+Lethality in my case. DST or MoB would alter the results somewhat I assume) would mean that hit isn't that valued.<br>
So I'm throwing it out here as a idea. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
As for the overall mutilate aspect. I'd have to disagree. The suggested spec assumes the usage of dual DP that is highly unlikely as WF is much better (at least with a warrior in the group). Even in case of GoA I would use IP over dual deadly. <br>
I personally use: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302210809/http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=fhe0oEMoidVoGcV0bV" target="_blank">this build.</a><br>
Even without Imp. Poisons I rarely find DP falling off and Fleet Footed allows Dexterity or Surefooted enchant.<br>
As I mentioned above, for mutilate hit isn't as important so I prefer Crimson Spinels over Pyrestone/Lionseye where possible.</div>

</div>As far as my understanding goes, first it is determined wether Mutilate hits at all, so 1 roll for dodge, parry (in dead zone or lag situations) and miss. This roll counts for both main hand and off hand. You won't see any missed main hand Mutilate but a landed off hand Mutilate (however, you will see a main hand mutilate hit and no off hand Mutilate at all if the target is already dead after the main hand hit).<br>
Then for each hand there is another roll to determine wether it's a hit or a crit.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">You do not want to let SnD drop, ever.  Hence, the ideal solution is to watch your SnD uptime carefully and do 1s4r when you can and 1s3r if you can tell that that will give you an SnD gap.

I have an additional question about the 4 set T4 bonus, 15% chance of being awarded a combo point when a Finisher is used.<br>
<br>
I need to furnish proof about this with a combat log ofc but I got the impression I was sometimes getting 2 CPs awarded when using a finisher, 1 from Ruthlessness and 1 from somewhere else (presumably T4). I have no other talents or items which could account for this.<br>
<br>
Now I assumed, rightly or wrongly, that the T4 bonus would stack with Ruthlessness but if I wasn't suffering hallucinations then this is not the case.<br>
Is this in fact how it works, the 4 set T4 bonus I mean?</div>

</div>Always be careful with the word "stacking," it can mean a lot of different things in a lot of different contexts. In the case of T4 4pc, it has its own chance to proc, independent of Ruthlessness, which means that you can in fact end up with 2 CP from a finisher. The chance of getting 2 CP is equal to 60% * 15% = 9%. The chance of getting 1 CP is equal to 60% * 85% + 40% * 15% = 57%. The chance of getting 0 CP is equal to 40% * 85% = 34%.<br>
<br>
If you average out the number of CP gained on a finisher when you have both Ruthlessness and T4 4pc, it comes out to 0.75.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I would just like to hear more opinions on this. The last I checked on shadowpanther.net, this item is ranked pretty high as a good PVE helm, probably comparable or better then X-11 engineering crafted helm or Deathmantle helm. I have access to Epic gems and Im planning to socket this with 2 Glinting Pyrestones and 1 Rigid Lionseye. Im currently using the X-11 engineering crafted goggles with RED. Am I making a good choice?</div>

</div>Well, using the weighting system given in the first post and assuming Hyjal gems, Grimgin is worth 40 * 2.2 + 24 * 2.3 + 82 + 23 * 3 = 294.2 (+8 if you socket for the bonus). Netherblade Facemask is worth 28 * 2.2 + 14 * 2.3 + 78 + 23 = 194.8 (+8.8 if you socket for the bonus). So the question is how high you rate Relentless Earthstorm Diamond. Aldriana's sheet puts it at roughly 93.66 AP, meaning that Netherblade is right on par with Grimgrin. This would make Grimgrin inferior to Deathblow and Deathmantle.<br>
<br>
Thanks for checking my facts. Next time I update the first post, I'll fix that.</div>

I am in a dilemma on this decision because although RED is hard to give up on, the fact that I have to socket 2 blue gems to fulfill its requirement makes me feel as though it cancels out its advantage. Losing 10 hit for 16 stam hurts.</div>

</div>Again, using Aldriana's weighting, you're looking at a meta gem that grants over 90 AP, versus losing 10 hit (which would be about 23 AP worth). RED is <i>huge</i>, make no mistake. Additionally, you can use your two blue gems to activate socket bonuses that you wouldn't otherwise have gotten, lessening the impact of the 10 hit loss.</div>

       I would like to understand a little be more on the mechanics of expertise. I've been told that dpsing from behind a raid boss, that you can get dodged and thus the significance of this stat. But, I can't really recall if I have in fact seen a dodge from dpsing behind a target, so I'd like to verify the validity of that statement. Given, that if you cannot be dodged from behind the target this would infer that you are at 0% dodge, and x% miss depending only on your hit rating. Would that make expertise be more meaningful only in situations where you may be moving all around your target and dpsing from the front a good amount of the time? While I'm sure there is already some preliminary number crunching going on the ptr regarding this change, is there an AP equivalency for it at this point? How can I quantify using hit vs. expertise when stat weighing gear in this case? Might I wear a set of gear that includes some expertise up to the cap for a fight that moves around alot and only gear that favors hit when doing simple tank and spank? <br>
<br>
Also, in regards to armor reduction or penatration, implicitly, you cannot reduce a targets armor mitigation below 0%, so is there a magic number on how much you should keep in mind if you were to use this stat to your advantage?<br>
<br>
Thank you in advance, and I appologize if these questions sound ignorant.</div>

There are no parries or blocks when attacking from behind.<br>
Attacks from the front can be parried, this resets boss swingtimer increasing dps on tank.<br>

I'm sure you have also experienced doing a rupture on a boss yet you still have all your combopoints. Then you do 1-2 more ss before noticing it, fucking up the cycle and wasting cps and so on... Dodge of DOOM!<br>
<br>
Armorlevels varies, so theres not ONE magical number of armorpenetration that acts as a CAP. Believe theres a thread on boss armorvalues, there you can subtract your common armordebuffs on a target, then subtract whatever armorpenetration you have on your gear and youll see if you go below 0.</div>

</div>Looking at this, and after spending a decent amount of time using the above formulas, I've grown to question them.  I know a lot of the AtkEP formulas and AEP formulas vary, but for these, is your "1 Hit Rating = 2.3 AP" factor in Combat Potency?  Also, is "1 Crit Rating = 1.6 AP" derived from using RED?<br>
<br>
<br>
Few Questions for the crowd:<br>
  I've grown very accustomed to constantly viewing this thread for updates.  One thing that you haven't touched on is Poisons.  I know that DP is approx 45 DPS when fully applied.  I've heard that IP is best for your MH, assuming you do not have a Shaman in your group to give WF.  Has anyone really done the math on Sharpening Stones vs IP for MH.  I'm sure its been done, but can't seem to locate exact numbers anywhere (I do realize that the SS should vary depending on gear, AP, RED, and other factors, vs IP which will/should be constant).</div>

<br>
I'm wondering if a certain section could be added (if it's needed, however brief) of which builds aim for which stats.<br>
<br>
I know we all want high AP, Hit, and Crit to a degree, but Mutilate (for example) would probably put more emphasis on crit than a different stat. I'm combat daggers for a change of pace from maces, and trying to figure out how much a backstab is affected by each stat in general... we have so much crit built into our backstabs through talents; would I be off the mark to aim for AP gear in that sense? My mace (Dragonmaw) procced haste, and I went a little overboard stacking other haste items (SSD, Crystalweave Cape), just because i loved seeing that MH speed pushed further and further down (SnD, Blade Flurry, Mongoose, Dragonmaw, Abacus, etc).<br>
<br>
A simple paragraph on good ratios to aim for for vaying builds would be the only thing I can think that's missing from the thread.<br>

		<div id="post_message_525016">I don't believe the weighings actually change as much as many think.  People forget that one of the main reasons hit rating is better than crit rating is that it takes 10*82/52 for 1% hit and 14*82/52 for 1% crit.  This makes hit seeded 1.4 times better than crit before you take into account Combat Potency or anything else.  If you look at the weighings: 1.6 * 1.4 = 2.24 which is very close to the 2.3 factor of hit rating.<br>
<br>
So, a mutilate build without Combat Potency may tip the scales a little, but I'd venture to guess the weighing won't change more than say 0.2 one way or another, especially since all rogue builds rely on a significant portion of white damage.  The same would apply to haste which even without Combat Potency, has a significant effect on one's white damage (where its giving its greatest benefit).</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I think part of the confusion on the derived numbers may be the surface inconsistency in them.  Even looking at Aldriana's thread, I am still a little confused as to how exactly these work out. For example:<br>
<br>
1agi = 2aep<br>
1cr = 1.6 aep<br>
<br>
...<br>
<br>
So, I am left wondering how exactly 1agi is worth 2aep within this system. So maybe a quick summary in the same place as the displayed numbers explaining how the base values were derived might help.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</div>The buffs used to derive these values were as follows: Improved Fortitude, Gift of the Wild, Improved Battle Shout, Improved Blessing of Might, Unleashed Rage, Improved Hunter's Mark, Flask of Relentless Assault, Warp Burger, Improved Strength of Earth Totem, Sunder Armor, Faerie Fire, Mangle, Heroism/Bloodlust. MH Windfury, OH Deadly Poison. Blessing of Kings was turned on and off as needed to observe differences based on that.<br>
<br>
Gear used was, as given in the first post, a set consisting entirely of gear a pre-SSC/TK rogue could be expected to have. Netherblade Facemask, Choker of Vile Intent, Bladed Shoulderpads of the Merciless, Netherblade Chestpiece, Shard-bound Bracers, Netherblade Gloves, Girdle of the Deathdealer (I also tried with Gronn-Stitched Girdle and had very similar results), Skulker's Greaves, Edgewalker Longboots, Ring of a Thousand Marks, Violet Signet of the Master Assassin, Dragonspine Trophy (also tried with Abacus of Violent Odds to ensure DST wasn't throwing it off), Bloodlust Brooch, Spiteblade (also tried with Merciless Gladiator's Shanker), Merciless Gladiator's Quickblade (also tried with Merciless Gladiator's Shiv), Sunfury Bow of the Phoenix.<br>
<br>
Builds used were standard 19/41+1 combat swords and 15/41/5 combat daggers. Your Armory, in fact, was what reminded me that I never specifically tested with combat daggers, so I will provide the values for that here. Note that a large number of your issues with my numbers stem either from the dagger oversight or from rounding, because I did not want to have all the weights be double-digit decimal. I think I'll change that in the future. (Weights for fists and fist/sword without Kings included for comparison.)<br>
<br>
<u>Combat Swords</u><br>
1 Str = 1 AP (1.1 w/ Kings)<br>
1 Agi = 2.00 AP (2.21 w/ Kings)<br>
1 Crit = 1.74 AP (1.75 w/ Kings)<br>
1 Hit = 2.34 AP (2.37 w/ Kings)<br>
1 ArP = 0.27 AP (0.27 w/ Kings)<br>
1 Haste = 2.01 AP (2.05 w/ Kings)<br>
<br>
<u>Combat Daggers</u><br>
1 Str = 1 AP (1.1 w/ Kings)<br>
1 Agi = 1.96 AP (2.17 w/ Kings)<br>
1 Crit = 1.67 AP (1.69 w/ Kings)<br>
1 Hit = 2.21 AP (2.24 w/ Kings)<br>
1 ArP = 0.30 AP (0.30 w/ Kings)<br>
1 Haste = 2.07 AP (2.11 w/ Kings)<br>
<br>
<u>Fist/Sword (no Kings)</u><br>
1 Str = 1 AP<br>
1 Agi = 1.97 AP<br>
1 Crit = 1.69 AP<br>
1 Hit = 2.21 AP<br>
1 ArP = 0.27 AP<br>
1 Haste = 2.01 AP<br>
<br>
<u>Combat Fists (no Kings)</u><br>
1 Str = 1 AP<br>
1 Agi = 1.96 AP<br>
1 Crit = 1.67 AP<br>
1 Hit = 2.10 AP<br>
1 ArP = 0.27 AP<br>
1 Haste = 2.00 AP<br>
<br>
The primary differences between swords and daggers seem to be that agility, crit, and hit are all slightly more valuable with swords, but armor penetration and haste slightly less valuable. Note that the values of agility, crit, hit, armor penetration, and haste will all scale up relative to AP as your gear improves. Also note that fist/sword and fists seem to incorporate the poorer scaling of swords for armor penetration and haste, and the poorer scaling of daggers for agility, crit, and hit.<br>
<br>
I'd like to figure out some way to integrate the above information into the first post in a compact manner. Once I do, I'll make the change. And as always, thanks for checking my facts for me. I'm only one guy, I can't get everything perfect on the first shot. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304073224im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/wink.gif" border="0" alt="" title=";)" class="inlineimg"></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">The advantage held by swords is not simply due to sword specialziation, but also do to the much more efficient finisher rotations that all non-backstab specs utilize. The average finisher rotation for sword rogues is in the mid 20 seconds (depending on 2 piece tier 4 or no). The average finishing rotation for c-daggers (3s/5s/5r) takes over a minute. That means that over time your combat sword/fist rogue is keeping rupture up on the target more often, and the increase in rupture dps offsets the DPE advantages of backstab over SS and generates a lead in overall dps. <br>
<br>
The single easiest way to 'help combat daggers' is to address the rotation. That could mean cheapening backstab cost leading to more CP, or something else entirely.</div>

</div>The problem with Rupture (and the whole "overwrite" situation) is that there are so many variable buffs that even were it very advantageous to optimally time your Ruptures it is basically impossible to do so. For example there are many buffs which you can't control, but end up going off, such as Mongoose, UR, TT, Hourglass, Ferocious Inspiration, Grace of Air Totem (for a totem-twisting shaman); there are ones you can (Bloodlust Brooch, etc.). <br>
<br>
You're never going to get the "optimal" buffs up just because there are so many, for example, at one point you may have Double Mongoose, and think that is a good point to Rupture, but the next time you have 5 Combo Points, you now have UR + Mongoose + TT.<br>
<br>
So instead, if you can, just build to five combo points and drop the Rupture, if you can't, I tend to SS an extra time or two (even with 5 CPs) and then Rupture when I can, then use SnD as I would normally. This results in little to no lost SnD uptime. Also, once you lose the 2pc-NB bonus this problem basically never occurs, because you're spending a lot more of your Rupture time building for the succeeding SnD.</div>

</div>I think for the sake of compactness, you do not really need to include all the additive buffs. Maybe just include specifications on the buffs that affect a total unit by a % such as kings, sinister calling, presence of Relentless Earthstorm Diamond, etc. <br>
<br>
And really, we should be thanking you! Taking the time and putting in the effort to write this compendium of useful information is really very neat. I don't think words can describe just how thankful many rogues will be to have this useful information compiled into a single post for quick reference.  So, with that, I offer you a hearty "Thank you!"</div>

That said, in the ranges that we usually operate (where it's hard to have more than 500 or so passive armor penetration from gear) the value doesn't fluxuate too dramatically, so as a first approximation I think the .27 number is fine.

				<div style="font-style:italic">blizzard has said they don't really care too much about this so called "totem twisting". i wouldn't read 'they're gonna change it' from that, but maybe they will.<br>
<br>
on the other hand, it's such a waste of time and mana on the shamans part that i REALLY think you'd be hard pressed to find a shaman interested in doing this. they need to be continuously throwing totems down, and can't really do anything else effectively at that same time (heal <i>or</i> DPS).<br>
<br>
it's only really a proof on concept; hardly applicable in a raid.</div>

</div>How is 88 agility for 5 people a waste of time and mana? Obviously, there is a gain there, the trade-offs should be considered instead of dismissing it.<br>
<br>
First of all: time. Not including buff totems every 2 minutes, all Shaman do while DPSing is to click Stormstrike every 10 seconds and a shock every 6 seconds. We have plently of free GCDs. Since instants don't interrupt auto-attacking, we can drop totems during our free GCDs to boost DPS.<br>
<br>
Secondly: mana. This will be dependant on your Shaman's gear, but I manage a WF rank 2 rotation with a max rank GoA fine. If your Shaman doesn't have the gear/consumable usage to do this, he should work out whether 88 agility is more overall raidDPS than his shock rotation and prioritise whichever is higher when he's mana constrained (it is most likely totem twisting).<br>
<br>
One thing to clarify though: GoA can't be up for 100% of the time due to the GCD. The best you can hope for without losing WF Totem is 81%.</div>

</div>Long story short, the calculations are far too complex to simply "verify independently," unless you wish to construct your own spreadsheet. The spreadsheet calculations incorporate all of your procs and talents as well as your combo point cycle to arrive at a conclusion. I can't imagine actually going through the tedium to repeat such calculations by hand. Might there be mistakes in the spreadsheet? Possibly. Are they blatant enough to be easily shown using calculations done by hand? No.</div>

		<div id="post_message_533461">As for geming for a Mutilate build, my hunch is (and the current Rogue DPS spreadsheet agrees for T4 level gearing) that +agi has a greater benefit than +hit. Thus, all red sockets should be +8 agi and all yellow sockets should be +4agi/+4hit.<br>
<br>
Unbuffed, when I ran the DPS spreadsheet's agility equivalence points calculator I got 1agi=0.74hit=0.56ap for a Mutilate build. Buffed (Kings and Windfury being the key buffs), the equivalence was 1agi=0.88hit=0.51ap. Since so much of a Mutilate build's damage comes from specials and finishers, the combo point generation scaling of crits from +agi yield a better DPS boost than the white damage scaling from +hit.<br>
<br>
(Interestingly, without Windfury +crit is worth almost as much as +hit in the spreadsheet, which shows the importance of crits in a Mutilate build. Also interesting was that going from Windfury to Instant Poison was only a ~10 buffed DPS loss for my gear level, which surprised me.)<br>
<br>
This was my experience early Kara when I was still running a Mutilate build. Getting in 2 4-5CP finishers between slice and dices is just awesome.</div>

		<div id="post_message_535109">Hello,<br>
<br>
I've been playing a rogue for a while now - never had much time to play, and now I have a bit too much time which lead me to these forums. I've learned a lot about the rogue class, and I want to thank you folks for all your hard work and valuable information. There are a few things that aren't as clear to me as I'd like however and I hope that as I read, the mud will clear from the water.<br>
<br>
I would like you to take a look at my current rogue on the armory, and give me a critique on how I could improve my raid damage. I currently am what I thought a rather pvp/pve hybrid, where I took out some points from sub (motd) and rearranged my other talents to be a productive combat build in a raid scenario. However, I feel that I'm lacking maxing out my rogues' potential quite a bit.<br>
<br>
If you take a gander at the build; the gear I have is the "best" gear I own. There's not much I change when I pve/pvp except for a resilience/+dodge helm.<br>
<br>
I have yet to look at my gems and their EAP worth, (which I just learned today from this post) but could you give me a critique on my rogue, and let me know what/how you think I could improve. (short of going to  a pve combat swords build; since I dont have any swords or daggers that are higher than 71 dps blues)<br>

		<div id="post_message_535164">Just so you know, these types of posts are frowned upon - the whole reason we have topics like these with summaries at the top is so you can do the general work yourself - if you have specific questions, you'll usually get an answer by "Here's my armory, tell me what I can do better" is best left for the WWS thread.  <br>
<br>
So as not to just be a crybaby about forum rules, to answer your questions, your best bet is to look into the two spreadsheets linked in the first post of this thread - for your gear level, and to figure out how things work with your particular talent build, I'd highly recommend the DPS spreadsheet.  If you end up in a more conventional combat build and with a tad higher gear level, I personally prefer the gear sheet (though that is a personal opinion).  Both sheets have a lot of value, and will get you within very acceptable margins of error for the answers you're looking for.</div>

I'll have to take a more indepth look at the spreadsheets - I had downloaded them and browsed through them trying to understand... but the problem I encountered was that I could not pick gear (such as maces) that I had, and therefore I could not use the sheet as I initially thought I could.<br>
<br>
It seems that as well created the sheet is; it's based on very high end gear specific to conventional "best" raid types - such as combat swords.<br>
<br>
I'll be posting the thread above in the wow forums to see what type of reaction I might get since I'm not up to par yet on the elitist level.</div>

With the change to mace spec in 2.3 would a Mace/Sword spec abit like the Fist/Sword one work?<br>

I do not have the 12 agil/+3% crit damage meta gem (I have the +3 damage/chance to stun one [which is underwhelming, by the way], and I took my helm off in case that was messing with something).

				<div style="font-style:italic">First off, very good post you have put together <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304035827im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":)" class="inlineimg"> been a good read with alot of great information.<br>
<br>
Now my question !<br>
<br>
With the change to mace spec in 2.3 would a Mace/Sword spec abit like the Fist/Sword one work?<br>
<br>
I understand the crit bonus is different on mace to fist but with weapons like BS mace *haste* would this be something worth testing/trying?<br>
<br>
Sorry if this has been posted before or has not been posted because it does not work.<br>
<br>
Thanks<br>

</div>This thread depends on the equivalency calculations that Vulajin has in the first post. The end result is along the lines of : Raid buffs make pure agi gems better then pure ap (with the exception of 1 20 ap gem from pvp) until you get access to t6 gems (10 agi is basically always worth more then 20 ap). That will probably be all moot anyway when the patch hits and the hit cap rockets up another 60 points.</div>

I ran the numbers in the above post and, as I thought, 11/28/22 is more than competitive with combat swords, even before factoring in the Hemo debuff. As such, it may be beneficial for several rogues in any given raid to be Hemo, even if all the charges don't get eaten up every time.<br>

</div>Now, in the interest of balance, what buff to Hemo (along these same lines) brings it up to par with Combat Swords, but doesn't trounce it out of the water?  I think it's somewhat ... silly that a buff to Sub makes it FoTM (though it's been known to happen - see arcane mages in 2.2) and something like this single change that totally affects the class and makes one build vastly superior (+5% dps BEFORE the debuff? yes please) is likely to get nerfed in the future.  It may be interesting (and hell, if Blizzard reads these boards, it might even be USEFUL) to extrapolate a weapon damage % buff to Hemo that would bring it completely in line with combat swords without making it so that all your rogues should be sub.   (I'd advocate a similar setup for assassination/mut builds, but Bliz seems to be happy with assassination atm).<br>
<br>
What would those numbers look like with a 110% weapon damage modifier on Hemo?  115%?<br>
<br>
And before everyone jumps me as a hemo hater, I'd really like it to be very viable for one rogue to go hemo and have it be an overall raid dps increase, but the marginal benefits of more than one rogue being so to be less (though still within ~5% of all other competitive builds).  If it isn't, and regardless of the debuff 11/28/22 is still king, then we just have the same problem we have today (Combat being the only way to be), except it's in a different tree.</div>

</div>I have probably been unclear in my post, but all the theoretical DPS numbers given for the builds <i>did</i> include the Hemo debuff estimate. At that gear level, Hemo/swords (11/28/22) comes out roughly equivalent to 19/41+1 before the debuff.</div>

</div>Well, the story of why I wrote my spreadsheet is a bit off-topic, but since you asked, I'll answer. This should clear up any confusion about my intentions.<br>
<br>
Initially my issue was with the accuracy of CP cycle models in other sheets. It's not that the other sheets don't have good models, but that they couldn't answer the particular questions I had. Specifically, what is the effect of the overall cycle DPS of the chance that procs don't occur? In a typical Xs/5r cycle, there is a chance the Slice doesn't proc Relentless Strikes, and a chance either finisher doesn't proc Ruthlessness. I wanted to have a more exact value for Slice uptime, factoring these things in. Both other spreadsheets, I believe, would calculate Slice uptime at ~100% for 2s/5r with T4 2pc. This is accurate in a sense, but if Slice ever drops (in the situation of no-procs, for example), then your <i>average</i> Slice uptime cannot possibly be 100%.<br>
<br>
My second issue had to do with the lack of freedom in cycle selection in the other sheets. I really wanted to be able to enter literally any cycle in my sheet, and compare it accurately against other cycles. For this, I needed more than just Slice uptime and Rupture uptime; I needed to know exact values for white DPS (to figure out the DPS contribution of Slice) and for special attacks (both Sinister Strike/Backstab and finishers). So I implemented calculations for these things.<br>
<br>
Another thing I needed to know was my energy contribution from Combat Potency. This was a function of several haste effects, such as Mongoose, which is a 2% haste proc with no internal cooldown. Haste procs with no internal cooldowns, under the old way of thinking (in which haste increased PPM effects), have circular effects. Thus, I needed to create a special model for these things; so I did. I went ahead and added models for DST, TSD, Dragonstrike, and others. I made all these calculations intentionally circular along with my cycle calculations, to ensure that any self-increasing effects (like haste procs w/o internal cooldowns) were modeled appropriately.<br>
<br>
At this point I realized that I had large portions of the work for an honest-to-goodness DPS spreadsheet done. As a result, whenever a new question arose for which I needed a suitable answer, I would implement it in my own sheet and use that to provide the answer. Some examples of the questions I addressed are: raid Hemo builds, Shiv spam builds, how RED compared to TSD (when patch 2.2 was looming), and how Eviscerate cycles would compare to Rupture with 3/3 Imp Evis, 3/3 Aggression, and T5 2pc. Eventually I also decided that I liked my sheet enough to use seriously (i.e. to consult for gear and buff choices). So I took an hour here and there and added a full gear/buff selection sheet (the gear mostly has yet to be populated, though).<br>
<br>
At this point after several months of using it to answer questions I felt couldn't be answered adequately to the degree of exactness I desired by the other sheets, it has approached the point of being roughly a duplicate of the same. Still, it has served me quite well -- most of the conclusions in the first post of this thread were made using my spreadsheet, and I'm pretty confident in their correctness.<br>
<br>
If you ask whether I feel I've wasted my time, my answer would be no. Although the questions I initially asked when writing this spreadsheet have been answered or, in some cases, rendered obsolete (read: haste doesn't increase BC PPM effects), they were still important questions to ask at one time, and therefore the sheet has meaning. And for the record, I do still use it for all of my personal DPS questions.<br>
<br>
Anyway. Sorry for the horribly off-topic rant. Feel free to PM me if you'd like to discuss it further.</div>

<br>
It seems as though as of patch 2.3, there will be a "build progression" that corresponds to the natural gear progression that exists in the raiding environment.  Specifically:<br>
<br>
Up to entry level t5 content, mutilate seems to be an accessible, effective build.  There are 3 kara daggers available, and a mix of kara gear, badge gear, and heroic purples can easily give you the stats needed to support mutilate.<br>
<br>
As long as you have the 4pc t4 bonus, you can experiment with deep sub builds that include active aggro reduction (shadow step) and death avoidance (cheat death).<br>
<br>
Once you move beyond the t4 set bonus, you can transition to pure combat builds to maximize your dps output.  Initially, that will probably be combat swords, eventually, that could switch to combat maces.<br>
<br>
Basically, the best build is highly dependant on the gear available to you and the content you are facing, and there seems to be a smooth, planned transition layed out as you move through content.</div>

Weapon skill will reduce your target's dodge and parry at the same rate hit rating increases your hit (more or less).  16 weapon skill = -1% dodge and -1% parry for the mob.  They can't parry from behind, but they can dodge.  This has the added bonus of insuring that your yellow damage isn't dodged, which makes it slightly better than +1% hit.<br>
<br>
The fact that it also reduces %parry for the mob is just gravy for when you aren't behind them for some reason.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">(This seemed like the most appropriate thread for this comment; if not, I apologize.)<br>
<br>
It seems as though as of patch 2.3, there will be a "build progression" that corresponds to the natural gear progression that exists in the raiding environment.  Specifically:<br>
<br>
Up to entry level t5 content, mutilate seems to be an accessible, effective build.  There are 3 kara daggers available, and a mix of kara gear, badge gear, and heroic purples can easily give you the stats needed to support mutilate.<br>
<br>
As long as you have the 4pc t4 bonus, you can experiment with deep sub builds that include active aggro reduction (shadow step) and death avoidance (cheat death).<br>
<br>
Once you move beyond the t4 set bonus, you can transition to pure combat builds to maximize your dps output.  Initially, that will probably be combat swords, eventually, that could switch to combat maces.<br>
<br>
Basically, the best build is highly dependant on the gear available to you and the content you are facing, and there seems to be a smooth, planned transition layed out as you move through content.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</div>I don't believe that Blizzard had such foresight when they planned BC itemization for rogues, nor do I believe your assessment of the viability of builds is accurate. Notably, deep sub builds will always be terrible for DPS, no matter what gear level. Combat swords is always a top flight DPS option, regardless of gear level.<br>

		<div id="post_message_537048">Is it really necessary to spell out every little detail such as EP for leg armour where it is obvious which is the optimum choice?<br>
<br>
There is pretty much one set of enchants which are optimal for rogues (with a couple of exceptions) in PvE.  The CE head enchant, the Aldor shoulder enchant (very small difference in EP between this and the Scryer enchant as detailed in the OP), +6 stats to chest, +12 agi to cloak, +24 AP to bracer, +15 agi to gloves, Nethercobra armour for legs and Cat's Swiftness to boots.  There is benefit on sustained fights to choosing +12 agi to boots over run speed increase but the others really should be a no-brainer.<br>
<br>
It is understandable that gems may need more explanation due to the fact there are 3 types of gem which change in relative power as gear progresses but this is not the case for leg enchants where 10 seconds thought on the topic makes clear that the Nethercobra is the best by far.<br>
<br>
EP is supposed to be used to weight similar power items for optimum choice, there is no question which of the four leg armours is the most powerful so including a section on EP detailing the obvious seems like a waste of time.</div>

"The effects of these two changes bring maces and daggers roughly up to the level of fists for DPS (that is, about 2-3% behind swords; however, note that daggers will still lag further behind on fights where Murder is effective). In addition, mace/sword builds increase in DPS, such that the top DPS builds will likely be sword/sword ~ fist/sword &gt; mace/sword."<br>

		<div id="post_message_540146">Perhaps you should ask some more specific questions then. What does "as viable" mean? If you're asking specifically about the change to Mace Specialization which gives +5% damage to crits, the answer is that Fist with inherent crit, not a lethality type bonus, is still higher DPS. What does "reasonable hybrid" mean? I think you'll find that most posters and information here are dedicated to min/maxing, or at least the theorycraft behind min/maxing. A hybrid PVE/PVP build is pretty subjective.</div>

</div>Well, for one, + hit % doesn't lower dodge chance. So, it wouldn't subtract from the 5% dodge that you say this enemy has. Expertise will do that. +hit decreases your miss chance, which is talked about at the beginning of this thread.</div>

		<div id="post_message_541113">I have a couple of questions. I am combat dagger specced, and without BoK AP is worth a bit more than Agility (1.96). When we raid, we don't always have 3 pallys, some times only two. So it boils down to this. You say that Salvation &gt; BoM &gt; BoK. Is that still the case for dagger rogues? If we only have two pallies, I tend to currently ask for Salv and BoM, but them I'm getting diminishing returns from the Agility compared to AP.<br>
<br>
Since the hit cap will be raised in 2.3, it is my understanding that stacking hit upwards to 363 will be the thing to do. If the stat values will not change in 2.3, I presume 343 will be the new cap to work towards, as the 20hit food will be the best food buff? So just to be safe, I wonder will the values assigned to the difference stats stay the same in the upcoming patch?</div>

Im not a rogue myself, im an enhancement shaman, but in regard to hit and crit rating<br>

For shamans hit rating doesnt have a huge value, since once you cross the 9% hit, you are hitcapped on your special attacks for bosses...<br>

A enhancement shamans dps chart looks pretty much this way:<br>
50% White attacks<br>
30% Windfury<br>
10% Stormstrike<br>
10% Shocks<br>

That means if i invest into hit when i have more then 9% (we get 9% from talents, so that starts right away), im only improving the 50% part of my dps....whereas crit for example increases dmg for 90% of my attacks<br>

Now ive been looking at rogues that way, and ive seen several different values for this<br>
<br>
Some sites say that rogue hit is equal to crit, until a rogue gets to 9% hit (special attack cap) and then crit becomes slightly better<br>
<br>
But when i see the values in this topic hit is vastly vastly superior<br>
<br>
Now i know rogues have a lot of abilities (restore energy on hit / poisons) which require you to hit the enemy, but do those way up against the fact that with hit you boost a smaller portion of your dps then crit for example does...</div>

My personal conclusion from these numbers is that given equal gear, PvE experience with the build, 115% speed Fleet Footed, and some good theorycrafting for Mutilate, a 41/20 Rogue <i>on poisonable mobs</i> can probably do 95% of a Sword Rogue's damage. From that point it becomes a matter of opinion whether Quick Recovery closes the gap.<br>

Always keep Slice and Dice up<br>

<br>
The first page show that hit has quite a higher value (2.34 vs 1.74 for combat swords), but i read that part includes all ablities which have on hit procs</div>

		<div id="post_message_541645">Just to clarify a few things about hit/crit values..<br>
<br>
1% Crit &gt; 1% Hit<br>
1 hit RATING &gt; 1 crit RATING<br>
<br>
Thus, due to hit and crit rating being equal in the developers eyes for itemization, items with hit rating tend to be better.<br>
<br>
This is due largely to 2 factors:<br>
-Several powerful procs which only occur on a successful melee attack (hit OR crit, not miss)<br>
-High amount of white damage (affected equally by hit and crit)<br>
<br>
A typical rogue will be somewhere around 65% white damage, 25% SS, 6% rupture, 4% deadly poison.  This makes for 65% damage which is affected equally by hit and crit, 25% just by crit and 4% just by hit (keeping DP stack up.. although not really a big issue).<br>
<br>
This may seem like crit would be worth more (25% &gt; 4%, right?) but due to so many procs that a rogue depends on (Combat Potency, DST, Mongoose, Poisons, etc) which are very powerful, hit edges out crit.. per RATING.  Yes, 22 crit rating &gt; 15.7 hit rating... but rating point for rating point, hit is better.<br>
<br>
Using the values quoted above:<br>
2.34 apEP * 15.7 rating per hit = 36.74 apEP per 1% hit<br>
1.74 apEP * 22.1 rating per crit = 38.45 apEP per 1% crit</div>

</div>Best I can figure they think it'll be fun to run around with 115% speed and want to see if the damage can be competitive.<br>
<br>
I went and tested 41/20/0 up to Gorefiend with Boundless Agony/S2 shiv and it performed a solid 200 (12-14%) dps worse then BoI/s2quickblade in the same situations. I chalk some of that up to general mutilate newbness but honestly and all things considered unless you are stuck waiting for drops and daggers are coming out your ears mutilate isn't competitive.</div>

Mutilate is less good it appears mathematically. With a skilled player in a guild that doesn't min max, it won't be so much less good that they throw you out of the raid. If the multilate rogue is more consistently on point than the combat rogue, he might win the meters. But it doesn't mean mutilate is actually a good choice if you are seeking damage maximization purely and simply.<br>

</div>And I'm very skeptical of the spreadsheet's modeling of Mutilate, thus the acquisition of hard data to support or refute it. There is reams and reams of data on Combat specs, but hardly any on Mutilate, and very little empirical testing as well.<br>

</div>This sort of stuff doesn't count; the truth is that nobody really knows how to raid with Mutilate. Is double Deadly + Envenom better than WF or Instant + Deadly + Eviscerate? At 3 CPs with 5 seconds on Find Weakness and 10+ seconds on Slice and Dice, should I Muti-&gt;Rupture or Rupture-&gt;Muti-&gt;some other finisher? What's the best gem for a yellow slot with a 4 agi bonus? 3 agi? 3 hit rating?<br>
<br>
Stories of "Well I spec'd Muti for a day and it didn't beat Combat" are just that, stories -- they are not hard data. As far as I know there isn't a decent Mutilate sheet or simulator in existence; nobody even knows what balance of stats a Mutilate Rogue should be looking for. Yes, it is true that it's doing less damage than Combat <i>right now</i>, but that may be due to a lack of information, not due to a straight-out inferiority. I wouldn't dismiss it so easily <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302184114im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":)" class="inlineimg"></div>

I raided as mutilate all the way from Attumen to Teron (fang of Vashj/s2 shanker), then switched to combat swords (double s2). The DPS jump was considerable, 3hit vs 3agi, 1 second of snd overlap in certain scenarios will not account for this. Mutilate isn't terrible, it's a decent all round spec, but combat is simply superior for pve damage, no adjustment to gear or strategy will change that.</div>

</div>While 200 DPS would indeed be an impressive increase, I'm not sure I'd totally dismiss it as out of hand.  The single largest determiner of rogue DPS is the skill of the player.  I've seen rogues in blues and greens outDPS rogues in full epics with an identical spec.  Ones ability to play a spec *can* make 200 DPS difference.<br>
<br>
Now, if we're assuming that the Mutilate rogue in question a) is reasonably competent, b) has been playing the spec for a while, and thus c) generally is playing the spec pretty well, it would be pretty surprising to gain 200 DPS from that point.  I'm not going to say impossible, but definitely unlikely<br>
<br>
That said, your underlying point - that Mutilate, while it can get reasonably close to combat, tends to run somewhat behind - is totally true, and I have no complaints with.  I'm just observing that the anecdotal difference between Mutilate and Combat is probably more strongly colored by the relative skill of the players involved than it is by the underlying supremacy of combat.</div>

</div>No one has <i>proven</i> the inferiority of Mutilate. All we have is anecdotal evidence from people playing the build in a way that "feels" right. I'm sure many BM Hunters would tell you that it "feels" better to pewpew with Illidan's bow than with a Wolfslayer Sniper Rifle. I'm sure many Enhancement Shaman would tell you it "feels" better to off-hand a 91 DPS 1.4-speed weapon than a 71 DPS 2.6-speed weapon. Some Resto Druids feel that they are ideal raid healers, some guilds feel Curse of Recklessness will cause your tank to take additional damage, some Paladins feel that Devotion Aura is overrated. The purpose of these boards is to separate these feelings from fact.<br>
<br>
I am working on a true Mutilate model -- it's coming along slowly, but when it's done, if the math says that Mutilate is inferior to Combat, okay, fine! No big deal. But until then, lets not assume that speculation, conjecture, anecdotes, and personal feelings are substitutes for facts.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I was just wondering if anybody had the numbers on rating to percentage.  I saw that hit rating was mentioned in the OP but none of the others.  "It takes approximately 15.77 hit rating to gain 1% chance to hit."  What are the numbers for crit, dodge, etc.?  TIA</div>

Since the mainhand is also 2.6-speed the ZA offhand is better for fury warriors, because they may get 4 hasted hits instead of just 3 when flurry procs if their MH and OH are the same speed (or at least so I read on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304073229/http://elitistjerks.com/f31/t12720-melee_combat_how_does_flurry_work/p3/" target="_blank">[Melee Combat] How does Flurry work?</a> thread).</div>

I'm assuming that hit rating is the number one stat to go for as well as a 1s/5r rotation because of the cheaper cost of Hemo. I could be wrong though as I've not had any experience raiding with Hemo. <br>
I'm also asking this assuming (perhaps I'm being too presumptuous?) that sword spec is being taken for such a build.</div>

If getting close or exceeding the expertise cap is practical, it would reduce the finishing moves anti-dodge value of Suprise Attacks tremendously.<br>

Regardless if the cap is obtainable, Surprise Attacks has lost some of it's value with the introduction of 2.3, but I am ultimately curious as to how much and if by a large margin then should we be looking to see the talent altered?</div>

		<div id="post_message_543137">The principal value of Surprise Attacks was never the fact that it made finishers undodgeable.  The DPS benefit of the talent is almost entirely due to the +10% damage to specials it provides.<br>
<br>
Consider: for a finisher costing 25 energy, a 5% (or so) chance to be dodged means that 5% of the time, you'll need to spend an extra 25 energy.  When you add this up, this means your SnD effectively costs an extra 1.3 energy or so.  Now, SnD isn't dodgeable in the first place, so we're basically just talking about dodged Ruptures.  With, say, a 3s5r cycle, you're thus gaining an extra 1.3 energy every 22 seconds, or about 1 energy every 17 seconds.  Note that natural regen in this period is roughly 220 energy; hence Surprise Attacks basically increases your energy regen by about half a percent, and thus boosts your yellow damage by roughly half a percent.<br>
<br>
The other aspect of the talent boosts your yellow damage by 10%.  Thus, the benefit granted by Surprise Attacks is about 95% due to the damage increase and only 5% due to the undodgeability.  Hence, even if you could become passively undodgeable with Expertise (which, frankly, would be pretty hard to do and probably not worth trying for)... Surprise Attacks would not be significantly less good than it is now.</div>

</div>You really really really want to read the first post of this thread. It does a good job of explaining why your love of evis is unrequited and not worth worrying about. The efficiency of evis is already shot :P<br>
<br>
<br>
Edit: Here's the quote from p1<br>
<br>
"On Eviscerate: at nearly all reachable levels of gear, Rupture will be superior to Eviscerate on any target that isn't immune to bleeds. At 5 CP, Rupture deals 1000 damage plus 24% of your AP for 25 energy, or 40 damage plus 0.96% of your AP per energy. At 5 CP and with T5 2pc, Eviscerate deals 1245 damage plus 15% of your AP for 35 energy, or roughly 35.57 damage plus 0.43% of your AP per energy. Applying 3/3 Improved Eviscerate and 3/3 Aggression (121% modifier), 40% crit and RED (142.4% modifier), and 30% armor reduction (assuming a typical debuffed raid boss), Eviscerate comes to 42.90 damage plus 0.52% of your AP per energy. Thus, Eviscerate holds an advantage of 2.90 base damage per energy, but Rupture gains an additional 0.44% of your AP. At this rate, it takes only 656 AP for Rupture to overcome Eviscerate's base advantage. Simply, in any situation where you can Rupture, you should Rupture."</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">anyway, so you're saying this is a bit better then what i have?<br>
seems a bit awkward to me :x<br>
thing is a use mostly evis for my finishers, and i'm afried less crit will reduce their efficiency.</div>

</div>Well, the first question would be "why are you mostly using Evis, anyway?".  But moving past that for the moment...<br>
<br>
1) Evis gains damage from Armor Penetration as well; hence, while it may lose *some* damage from the loss of crit, it's not going to be an overwhelming amount.<br>
<br>
2) Evis is only, what, 5% of your damage output anyway?  So even if it does effect you Evis damage a bit, it's not that big a deal.<br>
<br>
3) Fundamentally, what you want to do is maximize *total* DPS output, not DPS from any one move.  The conversion factors in the first post are designed to estimate this, and by those estimates you will do more damage than with T5.   So if you're looking to maximize DPS, and you're not breaking 4/5 to wear them, you should wear them.  It's really just that simple.</div>

</div>Just use the table in the first post, this thread is here for people to use to help themselves. Please :P<br>
<br>
if you put 3 10 hit gems in skulkers you get:<br>
58 hit rating = 135.72<br>
32 agi = 64 ap<br>
64 ap = 64 ap<br>
<br>
263.72<br>
<br>
Shady dealers are:<br>
50 agi = 100 ap<br>
102 ap = 102 ap<br>
-175 armor = 47.25<br>
<br>
249.25<br>
<br>
Going from rigid dawnstones to rigid lions eye is something like 14.04 ap so I was wrong in an earlier post. According to the numbers in the beginning of this thread, skulkers are superior til t6 by about .43 ap. With blue gems in Skulker's and t6 legs as your first piece of t6, Slayer's would only be about a 38 ap upgrade.<br>
<br>
This doesn't take into account any sort of optimal hit rating or set bonus though.</div>

</div>You're right.  I was speaking from the perspective of a Night Elf without the benefit of an expertise racial, which means that, assuming that the base dodge rate is 6.5% (which seems like a reasonable guess), I would need 64 expertise to cap out, which is indeed challenging to obtain.  Particularly since not all the items with Expertise on them are actually good; while the items you suggest do give a fair amount of Expertise, there tends not to be a lot of motivation to wear Gloves of the Searing Grip in practice, as they're inferior to Deathmantle for most purposes and, as such, are unlikely to be worn for very long (in particular, if you've done SSC/TK long enough to have the shoulders, the belt *and* the glove, you're about 95% likely to have picked up a pair of T5 gloves in the meantime).<br>
<br>
So yes, as a human, you *can* reach the Expertise cap (although doing so is not necessarily advisable); as other races, it's somewhat harder, and even more questionable in it's merits.</div>

</div>That's kind of what I was asking.  You look at several peices of gear withing BT/Hyjal and you can get upgrades from the later, harder bosses.  As that is, shouldn't you have the best gems/enchants possible for your current gear to defeat the later bosses?  In this case, the guild doesnt need me to perform to my peak ability gear-wise every week, they ahve the bosses on farm. As for their policy on gems, not sure.  My question was mainly at how others feel about it.  With the 10hit gems (mainly used for 10 spell crit on pallies and 10 resilience lol) I could upgrade my stats with a good 18hit rating taht would last me till t6 legs, probably not coming my way for a while.  <br>
<br>
Maybe I'll just go ghetto farm gems with some of the guys and ask for 3 lionseye as my share of the gems/money.  Inherently, is there anything wrong, does it seem like "a waste of epic gems" if I'll be keeping them for a month or more at the very least?</div>

		<div id="post_message_543396">Well, even for a Night Elf, a 5.75% (including the 2.5% from Weapon Expertise) lower chance to be dodged can be achieved, which is great.<br>
<br>
With regard to the gear, the Shoulderpads of the Stranger are actually better than the Deathmantle Shoulderpads (at least in patch 2.3, they're extremely close in 2.2) and the 2 pairs of gloves are so very close to each other that you may as well just take whichever you get first, unless replacing the Searing Grip gloves will net you the 4-piece Deathmantle bonus.  That would be the only reason to make a point of taking Deathmantle pieces over the non-tier items.<br>
<br>
If you're operating at tier 6 level, however, then obviously it would be foolish to not upgrade to the tier 6 equivalents, just for the sake of reaching the Expertise cap.<br>
<br>
If Blizzard ever decide to include Rupture in the Deathmantle 2-piece bonus, however, then the Deathmantle pieces will be the clear best-in-slot items at tier 5 level.<br>
<br>
--edit--<br>
<br>
With regard to testing dodge rates I think the best we can do is something similar to the way the hit caps were tested.  Get somebody with all the Expertise gear they can get (preferably including some human and some non-human characters) and see if they can ever record a long test without a dodge showing up (let's say against Venoxis).  Slowly take away gear and talent points until you see a dodge.  It's not the most accurate test in the world but it at least gives a minimum baseline for base dodge rates.<br>
<br>
It's certainly better than simply seeing how many times you were dodged in a particular bossfight, since that could vary for any number of reasons, not the least of which is pure dumb luck.</div>

</div>Well, getting your Expertise rating into the 20's and fighting 73 bosses would be the way to go to test dodge.  Parry will be harder, as it is thought to be much higher and gear can't get you to the 52 Expertise you might need to really narrow it down.<br>
<br>
If you believe that 26 Expertise is the number you need (for 6.5% dodge):<br>
Test as follows:<br>
1)  Equip gear to 25 Expertise until a boss dodges you, maybe a couple times to be sure.  This will prove that the dodge rate is greater than 6.25%.<br>
<br>
2)  Equip gear to 26 Expertise and get as many reps in vs. 73 bosses showing that you never get a dodge.<br>
<br>
3)  With enough repetitions, this would prove the dodge rate to be between 6.25% and 6.5%, given that 6.5% makes a lot of theoretical sense, many would probably say its proven.  You could follow up with a lot of reps at 25 Expertise trying to show that the observed dodge rate still appears to be about 0.25% at that level.<br>
<br>
Now, we don't know that 6.5% is really the number, so depending on your results, you would add more Expertise if you are still experiencing dodges, and reduce your Expertise if you have a lot of reps with no dodges, until you are confident how much Expertise it takes.<br>
<br>
And, I am speaking actual Expertise (not Expertise rating).</div>

</div>Right idea, but it's actually much better to work up by increasing your Expertise while still getting dodges.

Definitely true.  Can't prove because of a lack of information.  <br>
<br>
I have the searing grip, gloves, vashj belt (which with human and talents gets me to liek 16.5 expertise) and I'll try with and without the gloves on VR.  Its' a steady fight, long in duration usually and can easily be done.  I'll check out what I get on there both with and without the gloves (about 1.1 expertise I think). <br>
<br>
My hope is that with 6.5% dodge (assumed of course) I'll be able to mitigate a good 4-4.5% of the dodges, which on 700+ swings is quite a bit. The downside, of course, is that to maintain my miss percentage that I just finally got to (289 with 6% passive haste and 371 weapon skill), I'll have to ravage some items and socket with mostly 10hits, meaning lionseye will go up in value (hence I previously asked about socketing my Skulker's Greaves).  We'll have to see after tuesday, I guess.  :-(</div>

		<div id="post_message_543517">I asked a while ago about the value of armor penetration, and whether someone could point me to the math or testing which verified the results the spreadsheets gave.  The answer I got was that it's too complicated to explain the math, and no one replied with any test data.<br>
<br>
Well, now I finally got a piece of gear with armor penetration on it (Shady Dealer's Pantaloons) so I did a very small bit of testing on my own.  While this testing is far from perfect, it was enough to raise some questions in my mind, so I'd like to ask again if anyone has actually tested armor penetration more extensively.<br>
<br>
My test was to equip a worn dagger and hit a level 64 spider (i.e. a convenient mob near shattrath that I could kill with this weapon using only white attacks) with various amounts of attack power (AtP) and armor penetration (ArP).  I used a 1-point expose armor to get an additional "armor penetration" data point.  Here's the data:<br>
<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px">
	<div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom:0px"><img src="/web/20080302191123im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/chestnut/misc/code_html.gif" border="0"></div>
	<pre class="alt2" dir="ltr" style="
		margin: 0px;
		padding: 3px;
		border: 1px inset;
		width: 694px;
		height: 178px;
		text-align: left;
		overflow: auto">AtP       ArmP     AvgHit
1166        0       93.2
1399        0      111.7
1735        0      138.4
1211      175       97.8
1444      175      116.6
1700      175      137.0
1166      410       95.7
1399      410      114.9
1735      410      142.1</pre>
</div>Typically, the number of hits was 30-40, and I threw out crits, so all the hits at a given level of AtP and ArP were N or N+1.<br>
<br>
The relationship between AtP and average hit ought to be perfectly linear, and it is (to the extent one can say this with such a small number of data points).  ArP shouldn't be linear, but it's close enough over this small range that we can get a rough answer by treating it as linear.<br>
<br>
There are a number of ways to look at this data, but the simplest is to ask, approximately how much attack power or armor penetration does it take to hit 1% harder?  The answer I get is that starting from 1735 AtP and 0 ArP, it takes 17.44 AtP or 152.8 ArP, so 1 AtP is worth 8.75 ArP.  Since the spreadsheets come up with valuations in the 3.5-4 range, this testing result is quite surprising.<br>
<br>
Of course, the spreadsheets model a level 73 raid boss with quite a bit more armor, but as I understand it, the value of armor pentration will be *less* against a higher level, higher armored opponent.  Unfortunatly, testing in a raid environment with a wide range weapon, and mongoose, unleashed rage, and other effects which change my attack power going off unpredictably is all but impossible.<br>
<br>
Other than the fact that I'm hitting a spider instead of a raid boss, am I making any other serious error in this analysis? I ask again, has anyone done any testing to verify the accuracy of our understanding?</div>

</div>I believe this is incorrect. *My* armor has less effect when fighting something higher level, but that's not what I'm looking at. Although it is discussing mobs hitting the player, rather than the reverse, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302191123/http://www.wowwiki.com/Formulas:Damage_reduction" target="_blank">formulas on wowwiki</a> state clearly that the level of the mob being hit does not matter. Damage reduction for a given amount of armor depends only on the level of the mob (or in the case of my tests, the player) doing the hitting.<br>
<br>
If you're right, then the common understanding (which I believe the formulas accurately represent) needs to be revised.<br>
<br>
What *does* matter is the amount of armor which the target has.  I'm not sure how to determine this accurately, perhaps by fitting a curve obtained with 0 through 5 point expose armor?  In any case, as I said before, and assuming my understanding is correct, armor penetration has a bigger effect on targets with lower armor, and so assuming that raid bosses have more armor than the spider, the value of armor penetration on a boss is worse than my test calculated, not better.<br>
<br>
EDIT: The curve fit says these spiders have 4985 armor, which seems kind of high, it is actually a bit more than the DPS spreadsheet assumes for bosses (7000 minus sunder and faerie fire = 3828) but the difference in the conclusion when I account for that is quite small.  Still looking for the discrepancy between my tests and the spreadsheet.<br>
<br>
EDIT2: Well, I think my tests don't mean anything. When I artificially add 165 ArP to the spreadsheet set up with my current gear, the buffed dps goes up 1%.  It takes 49 AtP to boost buffed DPS 1%, so the ratio is 3.36:1.  If I put in my test gear (worn dagger etc) and look at UNBUFFED dps, it takes 245 ArP and 28 AtP, a ratio of 8.75:1.  I'm sure it's just a coincidence that this is exactly what my test showed. On the other hand, if I put in the rogue's dream gear, It takes 151 and 50.   So, there's nothing to see here, move along.</div>

I can't wait to see on fights like winterchill, akama and others how much extra dps will be possible once I get my hit rating closer to the new cap, which tbh, isn't really that hard once you factor in melee dranaei buff, hit-rating food and just stacking pure hit, rather than ap/agi/crit or whatever else kids these days think is best.  lol</div>

		<div id="post_message_551743">Let me preface this post by saying that I have read the previous 17 pages of posts and gone through a few of the spreadsheets.  I have been a longtime theory crafter myself and this website has been an excellent source of information.  I've also done several evaluations of different stats based upon the armory values.  These evaluations involve graphical analysis via excel and the equation fitter to trend lines.<br>
<br>
From this I see that 1 Agi = 1 Attack power +0.025% Crit.<br>
0.025% Crit is 0.045 Crit Rating.<br>
<br>
So 1 AGI = 1AP+0.045CR<br>
Assuming Vitality and kings<br>
1AGI=(1.02)*(1.1)AGI=1.122AGI<br>
<br>
So 1 AGI = 1.122AP+0.05049CR<br>
<br>
Assuming the 1CR=1.76AP calculation mentioned earlier is true.<br>
1AGI=1.122AP+0.088862AP<br>
1AGI=1.210862AP<br>
<br>
I am having a hard time accepting that 1 Agility = 2 EAP (effective attack power).<br>
<br>
I apologize again if this has already been answered.  I have read everything I could find and wasn't able to find the actual methods behind the 2-1 AP for AGI equivalence.  Lots of people like to refer to it and accept it as truth I was just trying to verify the numbers.  Could someone please point out for me the error in my calculations?</div>

		<div id="post_message_551749">.025% crit is .55 crit rating, not .045.  So assuming 1 crit rating = 1.76 AP, the crit from agility is worth .55*1.76*1.122 = 1.09 AP, plus 1.12 = 2.2, which, conveniently, is almost the exact conversion listed for agility with kings.</div>

</div>For each spec, I define 1 EP equal to the DPS contribution that 1 AP would provide <i>for that spec</i>. So EP weights weigh all stats against AP given a particular spec, but the catch is that you can't directly compare EP values of a piece of gear between specs.<br>
<br>
Armor penetration does increase in effectiveness with target armor, but so do other DPS stats. Will it maintain the exact same ratio? Perhaps not exactly, but it's close enough for government work.</div>

		<div id="post_message_553193">A question regarding scaling, first time posting on this forum, you guys have helped me out like you wouldn't believe with all this info, I can honestly say I nearly doubled my raid dps. (granted Ive gotten some gear in between there but the information here has been a *big* part of it.)<br>
<br>
Im wondering, I know you have armor penetration and haste broken down to AP in order to help calculate item value but I know armor penetration becomes more valuable the lower the targets AC/the more of it you have stacked, Im also wondering if haste is the same or if it's a flat increase regardless of how much you have.<br>
<br>
Also how was the AP value of armor pen calculated, is it an average, on raid mobs, etc.<br>
Im in a guild beginning ssc/tk and Im starting to see these sort of drops out of ZA so really wondering if it's effective, going by the spreadsheets on what to take for the best dps as a combat swords rogue I dropped from 307 hit to 279 hit while gaining some AP and a bit of armor pen.<br>
<br>
*edit* just saw the reply about armor pen above, it wasn't showing for me before, thank you. Hadn't really considered other things scaling with AC.<br>
<br>
Thanks again for the info, and any advice/info in the future, keep up the great work its much appreciated.<br>
<br>
Here's an armory link if anyones curious, though right now Im in the process of replacing a nightseye in the pants with a dawnstone.<br>

</div>Of course it does!. One point of agility equals one attack power and roughly 1/40 crit. If the crit element hadn't be considered, how could 1 Agi possibly be worth 2 AP? :P</div>

<br>
Which fights, if any, do you (or did you) wear resist gear for? How much?<br>
<br>
As noted in the initial post, +Hit is the preferred raiding stat because of all the on-hit procs (Mongoose, Combat Potency, Sword Spec, Windfury, Dragonspine Trophy) potentially available to full combat rogues in progressed raiding guilds. For rogues who's current gear / raid makeup only allows for 2 or 3 of those procs, have you been gemming and enchanting +Agility to make best use of what you have, or are you making choices based on the ideal conditions?</div>

</div>On our first attempt ever on Solarian (note: we didn't get to her until after patch 2.2), I wore 165 AR. I immediately took it off for the next attempt and never looked back.<br>
<br>
The only fight I can think of that should require SR gear would be Mother Shahraz, but to be honest, I have no personal idea about Hyjal/BT fights. I can tell you that nothing in SSC/TK or earlier requires any resists.<br>

</div>I'm not quite sure what you're asking. You use EP for armor penetration the exact same way you'd use it for anything else. There's nothing special about armor penetration gear, if that's what you're wondering, and stacking any single stat will result in badness (except in niche situations, e.g. Daemona's farming set, which sounds like hella fun and I'd like to have a set like that).</div>

</div>Only Mother Shahraz requires resistance gear in whole TBC raiding, shadow resistance gear in particular. 295 unbuffed is good amount to have in that fight, but I wouldn't worry about it until you are actually in BT (SR gear craftable from HoDs).</div>

</div>Yes and no. As you correctly mentioned, every stat scales with your other stats. Normally, what happens is that as you increase stat X, the values of stats Y and Z both increase, such that X's value relative to Y and Z decreases somewhat (this is why it's best to boost your stats across the board, rather than stacking one stat exclusively). The difference with armor penetration is that as your armor penetration increases, the value of armor penetration <i>also</i> increases, so that the relative values stay roughly the same. So you're correct that there's less of a negative to single-mindedly stacking armor penetration the way there is with other stats. However, it still makes a good general policy to avoid stacking a single stat.<br>

		<div id="post_message_554586">First of all, thanks for a fantastic thread. Has really helped me push dps. <br>
<br>
Quick question, and Ive gone through some spreadsheeting here as well. Its the hit-factor combined with the 4/5 swordspec-build. Im currently at 312 hit unbuffed, and suspecting this is a bit high. The spreadsheet comes up with 280 hitrating unbuffed, which seems a bit low again, and if I adjust with hit / agigems I actually get a higher rough dps by bumping hit up to aprox 300. <br>
<br>
Do we still value hit as much in the hybrid hemo-swords build as in a pure combat swords? Page 1 states that hit should be as important, but I havent seen any real numbers on this yet. <br>
<br>
I hope this is a relevant question, and also hope it hasnt been discussed to death before (at least I cant find it here at the moment.) There is currently a discussion going on in the hemo vs sinister thread, but no conclusion has been drawn yet. <br>
<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Gern, please notice, that while the hype of combat/hemo speccs lasted, on the PTR hemo wasn't yet normalized as it is on the Live Realms currently. After normalization you need some quite good gear to get en par with combat swords when going 11/27/23 for example.</div>

</div>This is incorrect. Hemo was normalized on the PTR the same as it is currently. All discussion to take place about Hemo during the 2.3 PTR assumed Hemo to be normalized. The conclusions currently indicated in the first post of this thread are based on the same [correct] assumption.</div>

		<div id="post_message_554715">Considering all this discussion on armor penetration, why nothing about using expose armor when it won't gimp the tank's ability to gather threat (any non-warrior tank)? Given the equivalence point chart to calculate its relative value, it's worth about 615ap - or 922.5ap when specced - to <b>all</b> physical dps for 30 seconds, costing only 25 energy and 5 combo points - which I'd think is a fair investment.<br>
<br>
Though I get the feeling this is more about higher-end raiding, where I've heard warrior tanks are practically required due to their superior scaling. But no mention at all? Unless I'm missing something critically crippling about this ability.</div>

In any instance where a protection warrior is not main tanking, there is almost always a protection warrior in the raid anyway, so he has nothing better to do than apply Sunders. Although Imp Expose Armor is superior to 5x Sunder by 475 armor, it's not superior by enough to justify the rogue giving up his normal Rupture or Eviscerate or whatever.<br>
<br>
Last time I used Expose Armor in a raid was to debuff Fathom-Guard Tidalvess, because we use a druid to tank it and all the warriors are busy tanking other stuff. We have a druid tank Morogrim, but again, since there's a prot warrior, he does Sunders.<br>

</div>One of the sources I checked was wowwiki &amp; they say otherwise.

</div>That all being said, if you find yourself in a situation where there is no, and will be no sunder armor applications, expose is a very large raidwide buff and one rogue should be trying to keep it up - I have been doing so with prot pally/feral druid ZA group.  Cycles will very much depend on set bonuses - I'm currently using 2pc T4, so I can do 1s/5r/1s/5xp without losing SnD downtime as combat.   If you're running 5s/5r or any other cycle that's nearly 30 seconds long, you'll just end up replacing rupture with expose.</div>

		<div id="post_message_555002">First, don't give Wowwiki, itself, too much credit for declaring those additive first.  I did testing on this when the 41 point talents came out pre-BC, and I changed the formulas on the backstab page way back then.  As any Wiki, it's modified by it's users.  And maybe its relevant that I'm following these forums as the premiere source of theorycrafting, and not Wowwiki.<br>
<br>
I should probably add a little background.  I had developed my own personal spreadsheet and was looking for various formulas after the pre-BC changes to weapon skill.  Wowwiki was one of the first places I looked, because many people at least made an attempt to post the actual formulas.  Many of these are spot on, but many aren't.  I built some double-checks into my spreadsheet and noticed a problem with the backstab formula in particular.  I did some testing, fixed it on Wowwiki.  I actually ended up finding these forums after months of trying to find out what weapon skill actually did (as opposed to random forum posts saying it didn't seem to do much with no real quantification).  After seeing the work done on these spreadsheets, my own spreadsheets are now gathering dust as, in particular, the DPS sheet was enough ahead of my own effort that I converted.<br>
<br>
I never really went back to Wowwiki to fix anything else.  There are too many pages, linked in too many ways and enough errors it didn't seem worth my time.  That and the fact you get people reverting changes because they "think" they know better, including people who believed melee has a small chance to always miss, not wanting to believe there could be a hit cap among other issues.  The fact that anyone can make changes without any relevant testing turned me off to the concept of correcting errors in Wowwiki.<br>
<br>
The 125% applies to but weapon damage and attack power.  I may have something to add to Hemo formula mechanics when I get some time to do more testing.  I did a little preliminary testing and discovered a few anomalies.  I was cut off before I could double-check my findings, it was time for raid invites and haven't had the time to go back and prove and document my possible findings yet.  The biggest thing seemed to be an apparent 11th charge...it seemed as though the first Hemo gains the benefit of the debuff, even when no debuff has yet been applied.  If this holds true, it means the real formula is 125% (weapon damage + AP/14*2.4 + 36) as it appeared you get a free debuff on all your Hemo attacks.  Again, this should be taken with a certain grain of salt, it needs to be verified, but even with a low-range weapon, my first Hemo seemed to be doing the same damage as subsequent Hemos (with the debuff up).</div>

		<div id="post_message_555150">That testing has been done, and it shows that hemo does NOT get the effect of its own debuff, even if the debuff is up (as it reapplies it).  That's why you see consistent damage.  Of course, if you have a solid test that shows otherwise and supports the 11th charge theory (presumably with a very tight damage range weapon and very controlled stats so you can predict within 3-4 damage what hemo SHOULD be doing), then I'd be very interested in seeing that.</div>

		<div id="post_message_555317">Well, that's exactly why I wanted to revisit it.  My very quick number-crunching seemed to indicate that I was getting the debuff benefit, but I was also hurried as raid invites had started and may have miscalculated something.  As to testing has already been done, I've heard that other places, and until I see the actual tests, it's hard to draw conclusions.  For example, I had heard how Surprise Attacks, Opportunity and Aggression were multiplicative, how it had been tested, yet no one could point me to that evidence.  I would have believed it too, if I hadn't already tested Surprise Attacks when the 41-point talents first came out pre-BC and found it to be additive.  If you can point me to specific posts or other forums where this has been tested, it might narrow down my own testing a bit.  At the very least I can check out their methodology to see if the testing was sound.<br>
<br>
It should be noted, I prefer to do all testing on Live, as Blizzard seems to make any number of changes during PTR testing, including sometimes undoing changes temporarily and reinstating them on Live.  We'll see.  This isn't the only thing I'm looking at.</div>

		<div id="post_message_555713">Spreadsheets are never an exact science.  They are more of a reference tool then anything.   I need to be a better reader in these forums, you were clear enough on the trash mobs.  I personally feel, in any fight, you want slice up constantly, so going for a 5 rupture cycle off the bat seems fairly counter-productive.  Of course, sometimes your fighting low health trash, and the rupture won't get the maxed milage, but you do need to consider the fact it does avoid armor, and with sub spec it will outperform eviscerate by a healthy margin *even when you don't get the full duration from it*.<br>
<br>
In the end it can be as simple as common sense.<br>
<br>
Your target has 75% health at a 5 cp?  Rupture<br>
Your target has 25% health at a 5 cp?  Envenom/Eviscerate<br>
<br>
I personally prefer keeping the mace spec for the stun utility (i'm stunning trash in ZA, to my surprise) and the +5% crit damage.<br>
<br>
My spec is outperforming my old combat mace spec, but my results my have several contributing factors (going from 368 weapon skill to, 21 expertise for example)</div>

		<div id="post_message_555756">Getting slice up immediately is imperative for every single build.  So start with slice after your opener.<br>
<br>
After that, rupture is your next best damage / energy, but you'll lose effectiveness if it doesn't have time to tick. So you drop the biggest rupture you can, based on the expected time to death of the mob. Generally this means building CP until the mob is at about 50% health and then rupturing for 3-4 points. After that, continue to build CP and then either eviscerate in the last couple of percent or refresh slice if it's fading. Bear in mind that Dirty Deeds boosts all yellow damage when mobs are low on health, so a useful tactic is to eviscerate at about 5% and hope to refresh slice from a Ruthlessness proc.<br>
<br>
Your goals are:<br>
<br>
(a) Keep slice up at all times<br>
(b) Use ruptures as long as the damage isn't going to be wasted<br>
(c) Spend excess CP on eviscerates if the mob is low on health.<br>
<br>
<br>
I haven't yet tested to see whether Envenom is useful as a final finisher - with builds containing Vile Poisons, it generally is a good idea to use Envenom rather than Eviscerate in situations where the DP stack won't have time to tick out (i.e. final finishers on dying mobs). However you don't get any poison talents in a PvE Hemo build. In any case it's annoying to be dependent on the DP procs to build the stack. Right now I'm just using IP on my offhand for trash: if the DP won't have time to tick and you're not using Envenom, then IP comes out better.</div>

We NEVER stealth in raids.  The loss of dps time that it takes to get behind someone for a garrote/ambush just doesn't seem worth it most of the time.  I would often lose 5-6 seconds at least trying to get into position for an opener.  I'm combat swords and I open every fight by running in out of stealth and whacking the mob with SS.  My white attacks start ASAP this way.<br>
<br>
Of course there are times when you want to use a stealth opener, depending on the trash, but in almost all 25 man raid situations I think they lessen your damage output.  The same is true of many 10 man situations.</div>

</div>Speak for yourself.  On any boss fight you need to give the tank a couple of seconds to establish aggro - there's no reason to <i>not</i> to start in stealth.  Particularly if the mob is being misdirected onto the tank, in which case you can be standing in position 30 seconds before the pull, so movement speed is irrelevant.<br>

Stealth when it's useful.  Don't when it isn't.  Needless overgeneralisations don't help anyone.</div>

</div>He did.<br>
<br>
So anyway.<br>
<br>
I've formerly been Combat Hemo maces, double goose on S2 MH/OH.  I'm a bit undergeared compared to the other Rogues in my guild (I joined a couple weeks back), but thus far I have done pretty strong DPS considering (almost always top 5 in 25-mans if not top 3).  Last night, I went to SSC and won Talon of Azshara, which I put Executioner on after the raid, and with my little Latro's (fiery) in tow specced Combat Swords.<br>
<br>
Now, I had my old info in the spreadsheet, which listed me (without the added Hemo dps checked) at 676/1250 DPS.  My current spec and gear (replaced icon of unyielding courage with abacus, and grips of deftness with fel leather) lists me at 697/1261.  I'm aware my offhand is 26 DPS below my last one, but even with S2 OH sword (which I'll hopefully be able to get next week), my dps only goes up around 15.  Not the massive jump I was hoping for, but my main concern right now is that the spreadsheet lists Executioner on my Talon at 15/28 DPS <i>behind</i> Mongoose.  That's an awfully big gap right there, and combined with the marginal spreadsheet dps different with my old spec (and very underwhelming grinding dps compared to my old spec - about 50 dps less), I'm concerned I'm just doing something totally wrong here.  I'm worried that the next time I raid, I'm going to underperform.<br>
<br>
Armory's in my profile, any ideas would be appreciated.  I know spreadsheets are just kind of guidelines, and I try different specs, gear arrangements, and read a lot of info when I can, but advice is always welcome.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I understand how Weapon Expertise impacts hit/miss/dodged/parried. However, I recall that the old weapon expertise also reduced the loss of white dps from glancing blows. I also know that things changed with patch 2.2 But I can not find any recent information on glancing blows.<br>
<br>
Question: does Weapon Expertise still have an impact on glancing blows ?<br>
<br>
If so, what are the details ? Percentage of glancing blows reduced ? Less damage loss per hit ?</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</div><br>
First, Weapon Skill (Old stat) took care of dodges, parries (we guess), crit and hit against boss level mobs. <br>
<br>
New Weapon Expertise takes care of dodges/parries only, but by a larger margin.<br>
<br>
Back, pre-BC, Weapon skill rating also took care of glancing, but they changed that post-BC so that glancing blows could no longer be mitigated.  As I understood it, they were lessened though, so that you would see less dmg reduction from them (since you can't mitigate them in any way).<br>
<br>
So, in essence, we traded Weapon skill for Expertise, which does more bang for the buck, imo but we lost hit and crit.  The new hit cap is 363, not 308, and glancing blows can not be mitigated.</div>

I believe it has a legitimate purpose at times within those fights if you have a tank that is slightly slower to pick up aggro due to any number of factors (GnM uses a warrior tank on Leo's demon phase for example). A well placed feint there will give you a little more room to work. For most bosses however, even ones with aggro reducing abilities such as VR, vanish should cover you for the fight.</div>

</div>It's not even that simple, armor penetration from what i've been looking into does not work in any linier fashion, there are<br>
benchmarks where the dps seems greater or smaller.  To impact this even more armor values vary from target to target,<br>
and you can cap it, on some targets and waste some of the armor penetration stat, and others will still not be hitting the cap. (0 armor)<br>
<br>
I'm working on stacking the armor penetration and my  impression if you can stack expertise/hit/atk power/crit/ and haste on top of strong armor penetration your going to find the magic dps numbers as a rogue.  <br>
<br>
Executioner is a good enchant, and better on someone that has larger amounts of armor penetration (sub rogues pay attention) , much like weaponskill was, it's a tricky stat and not easy to get real dps numbers on, it's ever changing.</div>

		<div id="post_message_557094">How about a section on Macros and Addons?<br>
<br>
I use <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304073239/http://wowui.incgamers.com/?p=mod&amp;m=2521" target="_blank">Discodice</a> for timing Slice and Dice and Rupture.  I used to use an energy ticker mod for pvp but I found with my ping it wasn't that useful.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304073239/http://wow.curse.com/downloads/details/5327/" target="_blank">Mutilate Crit</a> is useful when specced mutilate, and I used a mod to time Find Weakness (since it's not covered in Discodice) but I can't remember what it was.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304073239/http://wow.curse.com/downloads/details/16/" target="_blank">Cooldown count</a> is great for showing your cooldowns on your UI bars.<br>
<br>
The only macro I currently use is for deadly throw.<br>
<br>
/cast Deadly throw<br>
/cast Throw<br>
<br>
It's quite primitive and a short search of the WoW general forums turned up this more sophisticated one<br>
<br>
#showtooltip Deadly Throw<br>
/cast Deadly Throw<br>
/cast [Equipped:Thrown] Throw;Shoot <br>
<br>
Which will probably give an error when trying to cast deadly throw with a non-thrown weapon equipped.  Maybe not the most useful in a raid situation but I find more and more in heroics and solo that I'm liking to have the ranged snare for runners.<br>
<br>
Macroing trinkets together with Blade Flurry is quite nice too since most (all?) on use trinkets don't affect the GCD.<br>
<br>
/cast Abacus of Violent Odds<br>
/cast Blade Flurry<br>
<br>
Which will cast the trinket the immediately cast Blade Flurry.  If you have 2 on use trinkets you can add a second one to the macro too, the only drawback is that if it shares a cooldown you will get a message that the item is not ready, and if it doesn't you will need to press the macro button 2 times to activate it properly.<br>
<br>
Are there any others that people find useful?</div>

There is a bit of a difference when looking at mutilate. 49-53% is from white attacks and generally 30-35% is from mutilate.

</div>So, there are two reasons why Mutilate should be less reliant on hit rating than other builds. The first is the one you mentioned, a slightly greater reliance on yellow damage. The second is that Mutilate will rely on neither Combat Potency nor Sword Specialization, which are the primary drivers behind the strength of hit rating. Losing some hit rating, as long as you're hit-capped for specials, won't affect your cycles in the least, and it won't impact your white DPS as much as it would for a combat sword build.<br>
<br>
Crit rating, on the other hand, will not only boost your white and yellow damage, but also increase your likelihood of Seal Fate procs, thereby improving your cycles. In some ways, crit is to Mutilate builds as hit is to combat builds. The difference, of course, lies in the fact that hit rating is still far cheaper itemization cost per 1%. Will crit surpass hit rating? Of that, I have no way to be sure. I don't trust the Seal Fate models built into the DPS spreadsheet, and I don't have any confidence in myself to make an accurate Seal Fate model.<br>
<br>
However, we <i>can</i> look at agility and realize that this stat will likely retain similar usefulness for Mutilate builds to what it has for any other build (with a possible increase due to the crit benefit to Seal Fate). I would hypothesize, completely without basis, that a Mutilate build would favor <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304073239/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=24028"><span  ><span class="bluename">[Delicate Living Ruby]</span></span></a> and <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304073239/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=24061"><span  ><span class="bluename">[Glinting Noble Topaz]</span></span></a>, with the latter used only to fill yellow sockets for socket bonuses.<br>
<br>
Please do contest this hypothesis if you have any reasonable basis on which to do so, as I'd hate to be spouting misinformation in my own thread.</div>

</div>I don't have any way to contest that hypothesis. I do question your claim that hit won't affect your white damage as much as combat swords. I understand that hit is vitally important for combat swords due to sword spec in particular. However I have to say that I would question the overall damage loss from dropping hit. Now I just have to further test this. Kara is clear so I don't think I'll be raiding substanially until next tuesday. However I'll look into that more. I know I'd really like to drop the hit on my gear in favor of getting more agil if it really won't affect my damage much. I suppose I could go out to the blasted lands and test it, however I don't have a ton of gold to spend resocketing my gear. Any suggestions?</div>

</div>Right. Talking to a good friend of mine Kathil, an enchancement shaman prompted me to come here and further pursue this idea. I'm starting to see a trend here. I see why so many rogues push for hit. For combat it is such a big part of thier damage due of combat potency and sword spec. I didn't really understand that was the reason until just a little while ago. I am extremely curious to see how my damage would differ if I replaced some of my hit gear with more ap / crit oriented stats. Are there any Mutilate rogues who are in T5 who have experience with this?</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Right. Talking to a good friend of mine Kathil, an enchancement shaman prompted me to come here and further pursue this idea. I'm starting to see a trend here. I see why so many rogues push for hit. For combat it is such a big part of thier damage due of combat potency and sword spec. I didn't really understand that was the reason until just a little while ago.

</div>Crit is to mut as hit is to combat is a good way to put it (i think it was mentioned before)<br>
<br>
obviously more crit means more CP just as more hit does with combat potency(more energy = more cp!)<br>
<br>
Personally i would imagine increasing hit up to a certain level (lower than that of combat by a substantial amount) would increase dps just because hit is so abundant on gear and the amount of item points it costs is alot less than crit.<br>

Would speculation of gemming all agy/crit instead of hit (and just use the hit you get from the actual gear,) to maximise mut dps be correct?</div>

</div>Socketing Crit is going to cost more than socketing hit, and if the difference is marginal it might hurt more than help to replace those gems. I wonder what the spread would look like when Agil / crit becomes the focus over hit. I can speculate that white damage will drop due to more misses, and mutilate damage will incease overall due to increased AP and crit.</div>

		<div id="post_message_557971">Hello, I'm new around here. I've been playing rogue ever since so I decided I'd contribute. I'll get straight to the point and after make some comments on my part. I am sorry if I missed a post about this and I repeat myself but I couldn't find it with the search option and I just ended up tired of reading 20 pages of posts. Anyhow...<br>
<br>
I've been thinking about a non-combat PvE build and I came up with an idea. Pre-2.3 it was <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304073239/http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=fheboEboizVZZVbjoMh0o" target="_blank">40/0/21</a> and after <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304073239/http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=fheboEboizcZZVbjoMhMo" target="_blank">38/0/23</a> (Click on respectable point allocation for a link to WoWhead calculator).<br>
<br>
Anyhow the general idea is to sustain Find Weakness 95-100% of the time fighting by generating an insane amount of combo points with the least required energy. Hemorrhage + Seal Fate.<br>
<br>
After the patch it became apparent to me that this build would be stronger just by the fact that Hemorrhage has been buffed and it gives you the option to take new Dirty Deeds in a PvE-Spec.<br>
<br>
I also decided that taking Ashtongue Talisman of Lethality (20% per combo point for 145 critical rating for 10 secs) would work wonders if I could sustain Find Weakness so I could sustain the trinkets buff for the same duration. It would boost Seal Fate since I'd get more critical rating, which would mean I get more combo points and then the more combo points I get the easier to keep up the 145 crit rating buff.<br>
<br>
I am not exactly sure how essential the trinket is. Also I decided that using up maximum of combo points would be the way to invent a particular cycle. I tested it and decided it is/should be possible to keep up a 5 SnD / 5 Rupture / 5 Evi cycle. I would use double rupture but the first one won't end it's duration so I am forced to use Eviscerate. I decided to test it and it worked if I did start with 5 CP, waited up for near maximum energy and then hit Hemo 3-4 times to get 5 CPs again, use finisher and wait a moment again. This way I can do both Rupture and Eviscerate in the duration of 5 point SnD and keep the SnD up all the time. Both finishers are buffed - Improved Evi, Serrated Blades.<br>
<br>
Additional benefit is shortened cooldown on Vanish. Well you can make your own opinion by just looking at the both builds - of course the points distributed between poisons can be changed accordingly.<br>
<br>
Next step I took was using <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304073239/http://rogue.raidcal.com/index.php" target="_blank">DPS Spreadsheet</a> to check if this could be possible (I am not aware how accurately Hemorrhage mechanics are calculated there).<br>
The results of my experiments in the DPS Spreadsheet are as follow.<br>
Let us start with regular sword combat build and I'll show differences accordingly:<br>
<br>
If 20/41/0 is 1000 DPS then:         (1000 DPS is a random value, just to show the difference in the following)<br>
<br>
0/31/30 - 1020 DPS                      (Sword+Hemo, Adrenaline, Preparation, Deadliness)<br>
<br>
38/0/23 - 1036 DPS                      (The build suggested in this post above)<br>
<br>
Those were the results I acquired by DPS Spreadsheet which point out that with my gear I would gain 36 DPS by using this build. Also in my calculations I didn't include the fact of using Ashtongue Talisman of Lethality since I decided that it would add a blunt number to my DPS not including a specific build/dps-cycle. Unfortunately I didn't bother to check what cycle did the Spreadsheet suggest so it is possible that there might be a better cycle than the one I suggested as well as it is possible that the usage of Ashtongue Talisman of Lethality is not the best choice/is not necessary (though it helps to keep up my cycle and works wonders in combination with Seal Fate which results in easier generation of combo points).<br>
<br>
Honestly I can't tell how much of comparison to other builds it is just by myself. I came up with it but I tested the 2.3 version of build in Zul'Aman where bosses have little HP which mitigates the Dirty Deeds talent due to the simple fact of the 35% of the boss HP "lasting" shorter during the fight. Also in Zul'Aman there was no other rogue to compare myself with. The pre-2.3 build was tested on Gurtogg Bloodboil on which I was actually first (I had no Fel Rage) but the boss might be considered random so I am not sure if it is a good test object.<br>
<br>
I would appreciate if someone could test it, comment, give me some feedback on the build.<br>
If you are interested as to how I achieved the numbers (DPS stat) here is a link to my gear - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304073239/http://eu.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Burning+Legion&amp;n=Wickedwrath" target="_blank">WickedWrath's Gear</a><br>
As you can see I'm nearing the hit cap and I can use Spicy Hot Talbuk - Possibly different stat allocation would work better for this build since I think hit is not as essential to this build.</div>

		<div id="post_message_558320">It's trivial to model, at least in the average case where you get the expected number of crits per cycle.  The problem is that such a model is irrelevant in the real world.<br>
<br>
Look at is this way, taking a generic 5s/5r cycle, you need to build 10 combo points per cycle.  Leaving aside Ruthlessness for the moment, with a crit rate of 25%, that corresponds roughly to 8 combo point building abilities, with the other two combo points coming from Seal Fate. (8 * 1.25 = 10).   However, if all 8 of your attacks fail to crit, you end up seriously combo-point starved - your s'n'd may drop off, losing you a lot of damage.  What is the chance of this?  It's 0.75 ^ 8 = 10%.  So 1 in 10 of your cycles will be screwed up due to non-crit streaks.  Conversely, what do you do when you're on 4 combo points?  Do you build for a 5th, and haved a 25% chance of wasting a combo point from a Seal Fate proc?  Or do you only ever use low-combo-point finishers and thus waste energy?<br>
<br>
The key point is that deep assassination builds (i.e. anything including Seal Fate, whether that's SF/Hemo, Mutilate, or any other weird build) can't be modelled as a succession of identical cycles.  What you do in each "cycle" will depend critically on how many crits you happen to have during that cycle.  This is a fatal issue for both the existing spreadsheets, since they depend entirely on modelling an average cycle.</div>

This is a fatal issue for both the existing spreadsheets, since they depend entirely on modelling an average cycle.</div>

</div>But the same can be said for any of the modeling.  Your cycles get screwed up from lack of Combat Potency procs, or whether Relentlessness doesn't proc in a non-5-point cycle, or based on the 60% on finishers.  Yet these do not really affect the modeling all that much.  Good players adjust their cycles on the fly and it still approximates the damage fairly accurately.  I certainly wouldn't call these fatal issues and they are not unique to Seal Fate.  I would think the only effect that calls for extra modeling is the lost combo point possibility.  To be honest, it's also not hard to model.  It wouldn't be that hard to model a 4-5s/4-5r cycle either, just it hasn't been done yet.</div>

</div>The thing is, Relentless Strikes and Ruthlessness are only one chance of proc/no-proc per finisher in the cycle. Combat Potency has enough chances to proc during a cycle that it's usually pretty rare to experience "bad luck" of the kind that drastically harms your cycle. On the other hand, let's look at how many different ways there are to generate "4+" CP with Hemorrhage and Seal Fate, and the variance between them (assume a 30% crit rate for simplicity):<br>
<br>
- Ruthlessness does not proc, you crit twice (7.0s, 4 CP, 40% x 30% x 30% = 3.6%)<br>
- Ruthlessness does not proc, you crit once, you hit once, you crit again (10.5s, 5 CP, 40% x 30% x 70% x 30% = 2.52%)<br>
- Ruthlessness does not proc, you hit once, you crit twice (10.5s, 5 CP, 40% x 70% x 30% x 30% = 2.52%)<br>
- Ruthlessness does not proc, you crit once, you hit twice (10.5s, 4 CP, 40% x 30% x 70% x 70% = 5.88%)<br>
- Ruthlessness does not proc, you hit once, you crit once, you hit again (10.5s, 4 CP, 40% x 70% x 30% x 70% = 5.88%)<br>
- Ruthlessness does not proc, you hit twice, you crit once (10.5s, 4 CP, 40% x 70% x 70% x 30% = 5.88%)<br>
- Ruthlessness does not proc, you hit three times, you crit once (14.0s, 5 CP, 40% x 70% x 70% x 70% x 30% = 4.116%)<br>
- Ruthlessness does not proc, you hit four times (14.0s, 4 CP, 40% x 70% x 70% x 70% x 70% = 9.604%)<br>
- Ruthlessness procs, you crit twice (7.0s, 5 CP, 60% x 30% x 30% = 5.4%)<br>
- Ruthlessness procs, you crit once, you hit once (7.0s, 4 CP, 60% x 30% x 70% = 12.6%)<br>
- Ruthlessness procs, you hit once, you crit once (7.0s, 4 CP, 60% x 70% x 30% = 12.6%)<br>
- Ruthlessness procs, you hit twice, you crit once (10.5s, 5 CP, 60% x 70% x 70% x 30% = 8.82%)<br>
- Ruthlessness procs, you hit three times (10.5s, 4 CP, 60% x 70% x 70% x 70% = 20.58%)<br>
<br>
This portion of the cycle can vary in lengthy by as much as 7 seconds. If the entire cycle being used is (4+)s/(4+)r, for example, then the whole thing can vary by as much as 14 seconds, while the Slice will only be either 18s or 21s. Roughly 1.88% of the time, you will have a 28.0s (assuming Relentless Strikes procs on both finishers) cycle with huge Slice downtime. Another ~11.70% of the time, you will have a 14.0s (again, assuming Relentless Strikes) cycle with a sizable chunk of wasted Slice time. A pretty good amount of the time (~36.51%), your cycle will be roughly 21.0s, but the Slice will vary between dropping too early and staying up just long enough. Other durations are possible: 17.5s (where your Slice will always be wasted a bit) and 24.5s (where you'll never sustain Slice).<br>
<br>
The overall level of variance between the different possible cycles means that computing an "average case" cycle where Seal Fate gives you 1.3 CP per Hemo and you get 0.6 CP per finisher and 5 energy back per CP used on the finisher is not going to accurately model it. But let's take a look at that model anyway, assuming we want to run 5s/5r:<br>
<br>
10 CP - 0.6 * 2 = 8.8 CP<br>
8.8 CP / 1.3 CP = ~6.77 Hemos<br>
~6.77 x 35 = ~236.92 energy<br>
Finisher energy = 0<br>
Cycle duration = 23.69s<br>
Slice uptime = 88.64%<br>
<br>
But this can't possibly be accurate, because in reality each Hemo is not going to generate 1.3 CP, and things won't line up this perfectly. Even for normal cycles, this kind of modeling is inaccurate to some degree. The reason is that some iterations of your cycle will be fast enough that some of your Slice will be wasted, meaning your Slice uptime is technically over 100%. This kind of modeling that doesn't figure in the individual possible cycles will allow those "Slice uptime over 100%" iterations to increase the average Slice uptime estimate above what it should be. For a cycle with only Ruthlessness and Relentless Strikes, this effect is very minimal (to check this, I wrote a spreadsheet that calculated every possible combination of Ruthlessness/Relentless Strikes procs for some of the common cycles, and all of the numbers it provided for Slice and Rupture uptime were quite close to the estimates we can make using the above "average case" cycle method). However, for a Seal Fate cycle where the duration of the cycle may vary a lot and even the Slice duration may vary, the "average case" method is not going to be anywhere near as accurate.<br>
<br>
What we need is a model that accounts for every possible combination of procs/no-procs and the resulting cycle duration and Slice duration in a (4+)s/(4+)r cycle. Either way I'm pretty sure it wouldn't work out to be anywhere near as good as a standard Hemo build with combat talents. The point of Seal Fate is to improve the cycles you can run; since you'll give up Imp SnD in order to pick up Seal Fate, your cycles are essentially going to have to stay the same just so that you can keep Slice up.</div>

		<div id="post_message_559878">Hi all,<br>
<br>
I just needed to clarify something about Sword spec. I understand when sword spec procs on OH it triggers a MH swing. I'm using fist/sword. so my OH sword procs my MH fist swing with 5% crit on it due to fist spec. So this spec comes out with slightly higher DPS because my fist has 5% crit on it right? <br>
<br>
What I needed to know is what happens if my MH is sword too. Does my MH proc another MH swing as well? If MH and OH procs MH attacks only ( OH never gets an extra swing from SS ), isn't MH and OH sword superior to MH fist / OH sword?<br>
<br>
Also, I heard rumors that this has been corrected in patch 2.3 but on my combat logs, my OH sword still procs my MH fist so I assume nothing has been changed at all. Am I right?</div>

		<div id="post_message_559886">But the same can be said for Combat Potency.  Lucky streaks mean extra SnD time or quicker cuts, yet no one seems to want to claim that is an "irrelevant" model, to use your own words.  Nor would I consider it a "fatal issue".  People still use the spreadsheets to model their DPS in fights where you need to run in and out.  This cuts up all the cycles.  Still the spreadsheet, using averages, can still approximate relative DPS.  You could also try to make a similar chart for Combat Potency charts and show all the extra SnD time wasted when every offhand procs energy in a cycle.<br>
<br>
Now, that said, I'm not clear what the current modeling is and whether it accounts at all for wasted CPs while giving full benefit of a 5r cycle.  On the other hand, if the sheet had a model for 4r cycles, one could conceivably adjust one's cycle to the time remaining, dropping down to 3r or up to 5r when appropriate to minimize the streakiness. This would account for most of the various uptime options.<br>
<br>
My main gripe is the way you have chosen to just throw out the spreadsheet data because of one perceived flaw.  Combat Potency is flawed similarly, maybe we should just throw that out too.  And most fights you can't just stand there, so let's throw the entire sheet out.<br>
<br>
Assuming that Seal Fate is modeled correctly, it should still provide a decent enough approximation.</div>

		<div id="post_message_559952">The main issue is that given a rogue being reasonably attentive, you can always use the extra energy from Combat Potency, even if it's just to add another SS when you're at 5 CP, or get a 3CP SnD, so while it does break up your cycles, IN GENERAL, the additional effect is not WASTED - you get a longer SnD, buying you slack for later on, that you may cut, or you may need.  In other words, there is built in balances for the ebb and flow of the randomness of Combat Potency which reduce the inaccuracy and make an average model more accurate and tolerable.<br>
<br>
Seal fate, when it procs and you have 4cp, completely wastes the extra point.  There's no recovery mechanism, you don't just get to hold onto it and put it into your next cycle, it's gone.<br>
<br>
Vulajin put a pretty nice, LONG post detailing why SF was very difficult to model and none of it boiled down to "waahhh it's too hard and I don't want to" which is what your response seems to entail he said.<br>
<br>
The other MAJOR factor for Seal Fate not being modelled is that it just ISN'T putting out the DPS - Mut builds, 30/0/30 + 1 builds, they all fall a bit flat - is it because we haven't discovered "the secret" that makes them good? Maaaybe - but you'd think we'd see a lot more "I can do 1400+ DPS in my mixmatch T4/T5 gear as Mutilate" style posts if it was just that people needed to learn to play Mut.  I've seen some GOOD rogues play as Mut, and they still fall behind.  I don't discount the possibility that we're just missing something, but the fact that we haven't seen that stuff yet leads us to believe that it isn't optimal - so modelling it is just theorycraft masturbation, and while there is PLENTY of that around here, no doubt, demanding that other people do it for you is just lame.</div>

		<div id="post_message_560129">So, all of what has been said here regarding SF is true: there are certainly logistical difficulties with running SF.  It is harder to model than some of the other talents... I just dispute assertions of the form "I wouldn't trust any spreadsheet model of it, ever".  It's true, none of the existing spreadsheets handle it.  It's true, it would take a fair amount of work to model - more than for other talents.  But neither of those means that it wouldn't be possible to write a spreadsheet that *does* model it.<br>
<br>
For instance, lets look at Vulajin's handy table regarding CP generation for 4+ CP cycles in SF/Hemo.  Now, there's a lot of different possibilities there, and a lot of different probabilities to keep track of.  But, on the other hand: it's also a well-defined distribution.  How long does it take to get 4+ CPs?  Well, 9% of the time it takes 7.0 seconds, and 13.7% of the time it takes 14.0 seconds, and the other 77.3% of the time it takes 10.5 seconds.  How many combo points do you wind up with?  Well, if it took 7 seconds to get them, it is 60% likely that you have 5 CPs and 40% likely that you have 4 CPs.  If it took 14.0 seconds to get them, it is 100% likely that you have 5 CPs.  And if it took 10.5 seconds to get them... well, I'm not going to actually work it out, but you get the idea.  Well, now we just have 5 different cases to work through and the probability that each occurs.  From here it's not that hard to work through all the probabilities.<br>
<br>
Scaling it back a level: it's true, using straight averages doesn't quite work.  And trying to set up a perfectly sustainable cycle is an exercise in frustration, because it generally doesn't work.  So one simply models it the way you'd actually do the cycle in real life: you perform some standard sequence of moves, see how many CPs you have left, see how much SnD uptime you have, and figure out what to do next.<br>
<br>
So, in this case: my proposed cycle is as follows: you must always keep 100% SnD uptime, and you do a 4+ CP Rupture  after each time you do a 4pt SnD.   So, most of the time, you're just running 4+s/4+r.  However, if you get an unlucky string of procs and after your rupture is performed you don't have 4+CP before your SnD is about to expire - you use a smaller SnD, followed by building up CPs to get a new 4+CP SnD, and then go back to the regular cycle.  If you get a lucky string of procs that get you to 4+CP before you need to refresh SnD, you save up some energy to use in the next cycle.<br>
<br>
Well, that sounds like an awful mess, right?  Well, no, not really.  Since we have the probability distributions for the number of combo points generated and the amount of time it takes to get them, it's not really that hard to work out the probability that each event above happens.  You figure out the probability that you have to throw in an extra SnD in a given cycle, and you figure out the probability that you have to refresh SnD early to avoid energy capping in a given cycle, and from this you can work out pretty easily how many ruptures you're going to be able to fit in a given period of time, at which point the problem is solved.  Is there a lot of bookkeeping to do? Yes. Would the calculation page in the Rogue Gear Spreadsheet for this be 1000 lines long instead of 400?  Probably.  But is there anything here that prevents such a model from being made?  No. So, again: it's a harder problem, and it's a messy problem, and for these reasons (as well as Shaker's observation that it's just theorycraft masturbation since it's almost certain to be found inferior in the end) it hasn't been done yet.  But there's absolutely no reason why it *couldn't* be done.</div>

I don't see the answer anyplace on your first post. The closest you have is an 11/28/22 build, which trades one point in <br>
sword space with one point in dirty deeds. This trade off is actually a fairly large amount of DPS if you go by the spreadsheets, and if that's the build you're using for your numbers in the DPS comparison listed above then you might want to take another look and see if a recalculation is in order. <br>
<br>
The actual answer I was looking for was a new post in the Combat/Hemo thread.<br>
<br>
In 25 man raids combat seems to edge over hemo because the charges vanish before you can reapply it... but this is in part due to a bug, so I guess I'll wait and see when its fixed.</div>

</div>I would say it increases your personal DPS by ~20.  Ok.. so that was a bit mean.  Generally you'll find you get more dps out of Combat Swords personally, but slightly more raid dps by going hemo.  This is also, generally, only true for the first 1-2 rogues.  After that, the debuff usage % isn't high enough.. again, in general.<br>
<br>
If the Spreadsheet is giving you a higher personal dps with hemo - likely you have either lowish hit and/or lowish haste - two stats which scale much better for combat potency than any hemo-build talent.  Also, which spreadsheet did you use? Rogue DPS or Rogue gear?  In the DPS spreadsheet there are some checkboxes for hemo - if you set them up wrong you will get an incorrect dps value.  I believe the correct way to configure them is somewhere within the last ~2 days worth of posts on this thread or the one I linked above... maybe the Rogue Gear Spreadsheet.. I dunno.</div>

		<div id="post_message_560244">Shaker, you completely missed my point.  I pointed out that Combat Potency has the same flaws, you even stated it yourself.  It procs a lot you can cut it short.  Well, every time you are cutting it shorter than modeled on the spreadsheet is changing your damage relative to the spreadsheet model in a negative way.  Nevertheless, you can still model it.  Yet, you call such "theorycraft masturbation", Vulajin calls all such averages "irrelevant".  Yet, these averages can still approximate the results.  Just because a post is lengthy or even detailed, doesn't make it completely right.  Vulajin used an example with Relentless Strikes and Ruthlessness modeling, but you notice his example excluded Combat Potency.  Combat Potency's randomness will also screw up cycles.  How many times have people ended up with 5 seconds or more left to cut on SnD?  That's not the same as the expected model on the spreadsheet and there is wasted SnD energy unmodeled by the sheet.  Cycle times can fluctuate greatly with Combat Potency as well (at least as a percentage of the cycle time).  Yet, dps in action seems to at least approximate Combat Swords.<br>
<br>
Now if you want to know why I think all the builds are falling short, quite simply I think there is a bug in the spreadsheet with combo point modeling.  Let me give you an example, I was playing around with numbers, wanted to get an approximation of the value of 4-piece T4, so I forced it on...and the spreadsheet said the DPS went down.  Please explain to me how giving free Combo Points to a build actually decreases one's DPS.<br>
<br>
Now, I never said I think the spreadsheet is posting the correct numbers, it clearly isn't.  Hence, no Mutilate or Seal Fate builds getting anywhere close to the supposed theoretical DPS.  I think this is the same issue with T4 4-piece modeling.  I seem to remember old posts about plans to look into that problem, but no follow-up.<br>
<br>
As to Seal Fate follow-up and no recovery, I gave you a recovery in my post, but you seemed not to read it.  You accept 4 CP and not waste the combo points.  How to play the Seal Fate/Hemo build seems pretty obvious.  You cap SnD and Rupture/Evis when you have 4 or more CP so as not to waste any.  You have extra SnD time, you let your energy regen a bit before finishing the cycle, hit it just before your energy fills up.  You don't have enough, you cut the cycle off early and keep SnD up instead.  It's really not as difficult as it seems.  I just don't think the number coming out of the sheet are correct.<br>
<br>
In summary, I still don't believe the average case will be that far off in practice, if a 4+s/4+r were modeled.  It would not be "irrelevant" nor "theoretical masturbation", the problem is that the only sheet that tries to model Seal Fate seems flawed; either because it doesn't model 4r cycles or because there is a deeper calculation problem in the sheet.</div>

I'm still not clear what exactly you're arguing against. No one has said that Seal Fate is <i>not</i> able to be modeled. What has been said is that the existing model is inaccurate, and that it is a pain in the ass to properly model it. Combat Potency is able to be modeled the way it is because the large number of trials (offhand swings) per cycle mean that your average performance will quite often fall close to the expected mean. Ruthlessness and Relentless Strikes technically should not be modeled that way, but based on my own spreadsheet (which models Ruthlessness and Relentless Strikes in the piecemeal fashion I described), modeling them as overall averages works just fine for all intents and purposes. Seal Fate cannot be modeled in the same way because the variance is much greater than that caused by either Ruthlessness or Relentless Strikes.</div>

</div>That is exactly what I meant, and I believe Vulajin's longer post detailing exact probabilities with Seal Fate combo point acquisition does not account for combat potency because .. uhm, at least for the next 6 months or so, that build isn't possible.<br>
<br>
Dontmindme, I suppose I am missing your point, because from all I can tell you're trying to get someone else to make a spreadsheet to model a cycle that isn't being reported correctly - if you're so on fire for it - do it.  As Ald said above, for most of us, the response to "how do I improve my DPS as a rogue with Seal Fate" is "respec".  IFF there exists some twist to playing SF and/or Mutilate builds that we're missing that makes them highly competitive with deep combat and combat/hemo builds, develop the concept, test it, bring your proof forward, and you will have a WORLD of interested parties.  <br>
<br>
It's not like we're all combat-nazis here, the moment Hemo became desmonstratably viable, there was a ton of work done to figure out how to optomize it and integrate it into the raid environment.  I'm sure (at least personally) there would be just as much excitement over seeing deep assassination builds being brought into the fold as well.</div>

		<div id="post_message_560471">In defense of SF, I can imagine one situation under which it might be potentially useful to play a deep assassination build.  Consider: it's been calculated that Cat's Swiftness is better than 12 agi to boots provided that one spends at least 3% or so of the fight in motion.  Hence, at 3% movement, we have 8% movement speed &gt; 6 agility, meaning that Fleet Footed would be worth at least 11 or so agility with it's 15% movement speed increase on a 3% movement fight.<br>
<br>
If, then, one were in a situation wherein there were significant numbers of fight that were well above the 3% movement line - say, the end of AQ40 with the Twin Emps (tons of movement) and Ouro/C'thun (both if which have significant movement requirements) - one could imagine that the value of Fleet Footed could get relatively large.  For instance, on the Twin Emps fights, where movement time is as high as 25%, the value of Fleet Footed shoots up to almost 100 agility.  Under such circumstances, it's conceivable that an otherwise mediocre DPS build could compete for the top spot; logical contenders would seem to be 30/0/31 or, perhaps more likely, 30/28/3 (and, of course, Mutilate).  Unfortunately, the only raid situation I can concoct where this would be true would be late SSC/TK, wherein Leotharas, Al'ar, Astromancer, and Kael all have decent movement components, and Vashj has both significant movement and snares.  In this case it would be at least plausible for such a build to compete, although I suspect in practice it still falls short.</div>

		<div id="post_message_560483">Oh, absolutely - combined with the fact that Mut builds ramp up FAST, a fight like Twin Emps (oh god, man.. the memories) would definitely favor that sort of build.  Alas...<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, on some of those fights, movement speed becomes a non-issue yet again - Al'ar taunt resists in phase 1, for example.  And our astromancer strat has barely any movement in it (well, okay, 2 wrath inside 1 minute, but that's pretty rare).  I've been using Tricky Treats on Leo.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304042124im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":)" class="inlineimg"></div>

Or why haven't anyone mentationed about it that much? I tried once to calculate roughly how much movement there is over MH/BT instances and I got to in conclusion that Fleet Footed doesn't add much on bosses, even thought its nice talent to pick if you are going deeper in Assassination. Overall I'm  just satisfied the funfactor of SealFate builds and was really waiting 3x/0/3x to give some sort of hope for SF in PvE.<br>
<br>
If we compare typical 41/20/0 Mutilate vs. 30/28/3 it comes to Mutilate vs Backstab as talent and their both different chances to proc SF, Poison talents + Find Weakness vs. Dagger spec + Blade Flurry + WEx + 3/5 Opportunity. Without no real testing I'm assuming Backstab as talent is better for proccing SF than Mutilate? I would definetly take 30/28/3 combat tree talents (+ Opportunity) over Poison talents and Find Weakness. <br>
<br>
We could assume that rogue with MH/BT gear has 30-35% crit chance, add in Imp. Backstab (+30%) and Dagger spec (+5%) we are probably getting higher SF procs than with Mutilate spec. SealFate would probably allow faster cycles for dagger, therefore it would raise Ashtongue/BT trinket value for this spec also. Does it after all come down to how well Mutilate scales versus Backstab?</div>

		<div id="post_message_560622">Here's my point.  Right now, the spreadsheet is modeling at least one Seal Fate build as superior to all the builds "we know" to be better.  To that extent, the problem needs to be fixed.  Personally, I'm trying to fix the spreadsheet and continue the project, but I'm not going to come out and say I'm developing it until I have worked through the ins and out of the cycle sheets and am sure I can really continue the project.  It's a lot harder to proof other people's work.  I only make changes I know are correct, so the cycle sheets are staying mostly untouched until I work through it all.  What I'm really worried about is whether these CP issues are actually affecting the Relentless Strikes modeling.  It's possible that since there are usually only 2 possible procs per cycle it isn't skewing the results as much as Seal Fate that has more chance.  But it seems something is throwing Seal Fate off or the theoretical to in action DPS should be much closer.<br>
<br>
To this point, on my sheets, I have:<br>
1)  Fixed the calculations for additive vs. multiplicative for Aggression/Surprise Attacks/Opportunity. [current version is still multiplicative]<br>
2)  Made Aggression work with Backstab.  [Current version does not give backstab these benefits]<br>
3)  Fixed Brutal Earthstorm Diamond for min/max damage on the (un)buffed DPS Sheets, not a calculation issue though.  [broken for those values on current sheet]<br>
4)  Fixed values for 2 or 3 Ranged weapons that were incorrect [had changed with Expertise changes and Blizz buff-ups but were not updated in the sheet].<br>
5)  Added Spinesever.  [discovered since last sheet update]<br>
<br>
To me, the only real advantage of the DPS sheet over the Gear sheet *IS* the supposed capability to model alternative builds.  If those builds aren't working correctly, then I'm not sure this second sheet is really all that useful, especially given the loss of any designated developer.<br>
<br>
And if what people are saying is "We don't care about alternative builds such as Seal Fate", then maybe it's time the DPS sheet just fades away.  That way all the focus could go the the Gear sheet which currently strictly models the top DPS builds.</div>

</div>I might point out that there's nothing fundamentally stopping the gear sheet from including the last half-dozen talents it's missing; it's just that since they're messy to add and not really that important, I didn't bother.  If some reasonably dedicated person (who would not be me, as I don't feel like investing that much time) would like to go through and make the changes necessary for that to happen, I would certainly be supportive of that goal, and would be happy to go through the sheet with them and explain what needs to be changed.  So if the lack of multispec support is considered a major problem with the sheet, it can probably be remedied.<br>
<br>
In terms of merits of the two sheets: I would say that the other advantage the DPS sheet has is shorter development time.  When game mechanics change, it usually takes me a few weeks (if not months) to get caught up with all of them, as a lot of the changes are hard to make; meanwhile, the DPS sheet usually has a new release in a couple days with an estimate of the effects of the changes.  Basically, if you want quick and dirty estimates in the short term, the DPS sheet is better; but if you want the richer, more detailed answer, the Gear sheet tends to be better about that.  So I'm not sure I'd totally abandon the DPS sheet so long as that's the case, as it does have it's uses even if it's accuracy is questionable at times (which, frankly, I don't know if is still true.  I know 6 months ago it was pretty bad, which is why I wrote my own instead; but I've heard it's improved somewhat in the interim, though I haven't verified that myself).  If, however, someone wants to take responsibility for getting quick updates to the Gear sheet out when mechanics change, it may be feasible to discontinue maintenance of the DPS sheet.</div>

I'm using T4 currently and my guild regularly clears ZA. When I get the chance to loot Grimgrin Faceguard my predicament is if I should or not. Currently I do not have RED in my Meta slot. When these two helms are compared, stats wise, Grimgrin wins out. However, if I put a RED in my T4 should I keep that for the 3% crit damage?<br>

Currently I get 1700 SS crits without RED.<br>

</div>Your guiild is regularly clearing ZA with more than one rogue or feral druid in the raid? Congrats on that. If yes, then do what you want. If no, then loot it over the void crystallization that will ensue.<br>
<br>
I have no idea what meta you are running but it's inferior to RED. This has been proved over and again. It must not be very good given your apparent willingness to replace it with a no-meta-gem helm. So replace it with the RED and then do whatever you want with the hypothetical Grimgrin since it'll be slightly less good than the Tier 4 helm regardless.<br>
<br>
If you want more stats at the expense of maximized dps then I'd argue this thread is not really what you're looking for. You can already evaluate stats quite well on your own, I'm sure.</div>

</div>As was mentioned a few posts back by Shaker, the 2-piece Netherblade bonus is particularly strong because it enables you to tighten your cycles (i.e. redirecting energy from slice and dice to rupture uptime: 1s/5r or 2s/5r).  Since you are only running two pieces of Netherblade -- including the helmet -- I would suggest keeping your T4 helmet and upgrading to a RED.</div>

</div>And again... If the druid is a dpser and has an inferior helm give him the Grimgrin. You want your T4 anyway with a diamond upgrade. It's better. Two piece T4 is nice. And the RED has a scaling bonus.<br>
<br>
If you kill Zul'jin enough you'll have another chance at the Grimgrin and you can take one too. But if you actually want to maximize your personal DPS, you already have the tool at your disposal.<br>
<br>
As for 4 hit / 4 agi gems, those are quite often the gem of choice for maximizing DPS as well at your gear level.</div>

	</table>
</div>Well, my take on it is as follows:<br>
<br>
With a typical sword cycle, you should be able to maintain ~70% uptime on this trinket.  Additionally, a little clever energy management will allow you to make virtually all of your Sinister Strikes during periods of trinket uptime.  In this case, the damage boost for a combat sword build is comparable to Madness of the Betrayer, a bit below Dragonspine Trophy, and ahead of everything else (with one minor exception, to be discussed shortly).<br>
<br>
As a Hemo rogue, your uptime will be a bit lower, putting it a bit behind Madness of the Betrayer.<br>
<br>
As a dagger rogue, it tends not to be very good, as it's hard to maintain uptime with such slow Combo Point generation.<br>
<br>
As a Mutilate rogue, I'm told it's good, but I don't have any numbers to back that up.<br>
<br>
Hence, if you are a sword or hemo rogue, you probably end up using it.  Why?  Because you need two trinkets, and you more than likely have Dragonspine Trophy and Ashtongue long before you get a Madness of the Betrayer; since the difference between it and Madness is relatively small, it is probably not worth spending the DKP to get Madness (or, if you guild doesn't use DKP: it would be somewhat poor form of you to take it when it's a trivial upgrade over a hunter or fury warrior who would get more use of it).  Hence, most non-dagger rogues will probably use this for a significant period of time.<br>
<br>
As a dagger rogue, on the other hand, you probably do want to seek out other options, as it's pretty mediocre.<br>
<br>
So, in brief: it may not be the best trinket in town, but it's good enough that most rogues specced other than combat daggers will find it worth using for a while, particularly since there's only one trinket better than it that's easier to obtain... with the aforementioned slight exception.<br>
<br>
That slight exception is that WSC is actually the 2nd best trinket for rogues with certain combinations of gear; in this case, you may not end up using it.  To see if your gear/spec has dropped you in this bucket, consult your local spreadsheet.</div>

		<div id="post_message_565851">Well, shoot, this isn't hard to figure out:<br>
<br>
If you're doing 4+ cycles, it's 1 Mutilate then finisher only if you both a) Ruthlessness procs and b) Seal Fate procs.  Hence, the expected number of Mutilates per finisher is 2-p(ruthless)*p(SF).  p(ruthlessness) = 60%, and p(SF) = 1-(1-p(crit))^2.  Assuming you have, say, a 40% crit rate, that means p(SF) = 1-(1-.4)^2 = 64%; hence, the average number of Mutilates per finisher is about 2-.6*.64 = 1.616.<br>
<br>
Now, operating under the assumption that Relentless Strikes always procs (reasonable for 4+ point finishers) and that finishers thus cost no net energy (not precisely true, but will do for an upper bound), one basically gets 10 Mutilates per minute (as you have no energy regen outside of natural regen and Relentless Strikes).  Hence, one gets approximately 10/1.616 = 6 finishers per minute, on average.  This is a little higher than 3s5r which weighs in about 5.5 finishers per minute, but it's definitely pretty close.<br>
<br>
Now, throwing in 4/5 T5 would generate a few extra finishers here and there, so I can definitely see getting up to 7 or 8 finishers per minute, but if you'll pardon me for saying so, there's no way to get anywhere close to 12 per minute; to do so you'd need to have more finishers than Mutilates, which seems.... unlikely.</div>

</div>Click on my profile and hope to catch me in full pve gear. I use to toggle between MotB, WSC and my currently equipped Ashtongue Talisman by about 5-10 EAP in Aldriana's spreadsheet.<br>

Basically its a situation of passive ArP on gear and AP past the 2000 mark unbuffed i'd guess.</div>

		<div id="post_message_566157">I haven't actually figured out for sure whether it's a matter of high armor penetration or just high gear level, but, suffice it to say: it tends to show up as you move into late-BT type gear.  The fundamental reason is that Armor Penetration tends to scale faster than other stats as gear improves (basically because it scales with all other stats, whereas, for instance, crit does not scale with crit, hit, or Expertise at all).  For instance, compare WSC to Madness; you're basically trading AP for Armor Penetration.  Hence, as AP increases (which doesn't increase the value of AP at all, but does increase the value of Armor Penetration), or as Armor Penetration increases (which increases the value of itself faster than it increases any other stat), it's easy to see that WSC will become relatively stronger in comparison to Madness.<br>
<br>
With regards WSC vs Ashtongue, it's a bit more subtle, but, suffice it to say, it still does eventually happen, owing to the fact that WSC scales faster with Armor Penetration, Crit, Hit, and Expertise.<br>
<br>
In terms of a specific example:  I'll be happy to piece one together once I get the spreadsheet updated for 2.3; but as my working copy of the spreadsheet is sort of in an intermediate state right now, I can't really get good numbers out of it to demonstrate the effect in question.</div>

Shallow grave are better, don't worry, you'll probably not notice too much dps increase though, that little aep, but they are still better.  I just got the <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302181605/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=30898"><span  ><span class="purplename">[Shady Dealer's Pantaloons]</span></span></a> and looking at the spreadsheet, its not an upgrade till I equip them, then its only like 10-15 aep, but, still an upgrade...while losing 2.54% hit.. :\ Gotta love it.</div>

To the casual player who wants to know "which piece of gear is better, A or B", the existing equivalence table is more useful.  To the slightly more serious player that wants to know how these stats improve his damage, the in-game tooltips which provide infformation at the level of "Agility gives AP and crit" are sufficient - the exact conversions tend not to be relevant.  Really, the only people who need to know what the exact conversions are are those who are actually going to be theorycrafting, most of whom already know the conversions, and the rest of whom could easily find them in existing knowledge bases.

Sry, I think I misread this in my earlier post.  If I'm sitting at 1500 AP then according to this rule of thumb, the 5% crit from Malice would be worth much more than the 10% AP buff from Deadliness, correct?</div>

Ah yes, ur bringing back memories of my initial logic.  I am in fact primarily interested in pvp and I did go with the AP buff for that reason (resilience), and because I assumed the AP buff would scale.  I posted the question here simply because the conversation was around talents and dps so I assumed it was appropriate.  Thank you for the response and you answered my question.</div>

</div>I didn't mean that basic, but you were at least thinking along the same lines I was. I guess my main concern was the ratings, 15.77 Hit/Haste ==1% Hit/Haste, 22.1 Crit Rating == 1 Crit, and so on. But Ald, does make a good point, you could just link to somewhere that has that information.</div>

</div>Maces is worse then combat daggers when i played around with spreedsheet. I get worse dps with s3 maces then my s2 daggers! <br>
I also played around with s3 swords and the only thing that swords is better then daggers is because they have more talents points "over" . The extra point in ruthlessness, 2 in murder and last one in lethality. And the extra in 4 in imp  poisons. So without those combat daggers has higher then dps then sword! Its rather extra talents points then the specc  itself. <br>
<br>
Just checked and s3 swords need 2xmurder to outpass s3 daggers in dps. Which means that on poison immune mobs and where murder is useless combat daggers has higher dps according to spreadsheet with my gear.<br>

So simple solution, move improved backstab and opportunity to combat tree and daggers are where they should be!</div>

</div>Hey, Cmecu (tell Grim that Hanos says hi).  Right now daggers is going to end up being behind swords when you have similar options, the main reason this changed since before the expansion is that Sinsiter Strike got new ranks, and Backstab essentially did not.  However, if you have better dagger options (and with a guild full of sword rogues you will, especially once you get Vashj down) then you can be very competitive with daggers.  Before the Windfury and Sword Spec Nerfs, this was not the case, but now that Sinister Strike no longer proc WF or Sword Spec, the gap has closed substantially.<br>
<br>
Up until recently my guild had 2 sword and 2 dagger rogues (one of the dagger rogues picked up Blade of Infamy and Blade of Savagery to save them from sharding), and the 2 dagger rogues are that way because they prefer the play style.  At the highest gear levels you are looking at maybe a 3% DPS difference, which is small enough that until everyone has full ideal gear sets you aren't even going to notice it (T6 2-Piece bonus is a bigger DPS difference).<br>
<br>
Taking a quick look at the other rogues in your guild and your armory, I see some issues that are also contributing to the differences.  My guess is Taigori is your highest DPS rogue, and you are probably the lowest.  The main thing is you are running way too low on Hit Rating, 227 is atleast 50 below where you want to be.  The places where you can pick up some hit rating are also where you will see the biggest DPS gains:<br>
-Ranged -&gt; Arcanite Steam Pistol is still the best ranged weapon in the game as long as you are under the hit cap (363) drops from Al'ar<br>
-Neck -&gt; Choker of Vile Intent from Heroic badges, only costs 25, and is a nice upgrade over what you have.<br>
-Cloak -&gt; Either of the cloaks from Kara (Dark Reavers is the nicer of the 2), the PVP one from Badges, or the Haste one from ZA would all be very nice upgrades.<br>
-Chest -&gt; Bloodsea Brigand's Vest or the one from ZA are both big upgrades<br>
-Wrist -&gt; Heroic Badges ones or the ones from Astromancer are both big upgrades<br>
-Waist -&gt; Belt of Deep Shadow (Crafted) is the second best belt in the game and has a ton of hit on it<br>
-Boots -&gt; Heroic Badge ones also loaded with hit and a straight upgrade from Edgewalkers<br>
-Trinkets - Warpspring, Dragonspine, Tsunami and the ZA trinket are all huge upgrades over you current ones<br>
<br>
Comparing your gear to Taigori's puts you about 75 DPS behind him, and he has most of the upgrades I listed above (Ranged, Neck, Cloak, Wrist, Waist, Trinket)<br>
<br>
So while, yes you can get higher with Swords, Daggers is fine, and the DPS difference isn't a big as you would think, not to mention taking less appealing weapons might make it easier to pick up more appealing ones like the chest off Fathom Lord.</div>

Just checked and s3 swords need 2xmurder to outpass s3 daggers in dps. Which means that on poison immune mobs and where murder is useless combat daggers has higher dps according to spreadsheet with my gear.</div>

</div>1) What does it even mean to say "it's the extra talent points and not the spec"?  The spec has fewer spare points to dump into auxillary DPS talents.  This is (one of) the reasons why it's inferior.  If Opportunity was in Combat or Assassination, might the situation be better?  Well, it'd be better, but whether it would be enough is a hard question to answer... there are other things going on.<br>
<br>
2) I don't know about your gear, but with the default gear in the 0.8 Rogue Gear Spreadsheet, I show 1469.22 DPS without Murder (1506.59 with) for Arena 3 swords, and 1433.54 for Arena 3 Daggers.  I'm not saying there isn't gear where daggers keep up; I've just never seen it.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Hey, Cmecu (tell Grim that Hanos says hi).  Right now daggers is going to end up being behind swords when you have similar options, the main reason this changed since before the expansion is that Sinsiter Strike got new ranks, and Backstab essentially did not.  However, if you have better dagger options (and with a guild full of sword rogues you will, especially once you get Vashj down) then you can be very competitive with daggers.  Before the Windfury and Sword Spec Nerfs, this was not the case, but now that Sinister Strike no longer proc WF or Sword Spec, the gap has closed substantially.</div>

	</tr>
	</table>
</div>While the gap has closed considerably, it's still reasonably substantial; for instance, in comparison to the numbers above: switching to Talon of Azshara and Latro's Shifting Sword does 1434 DPS without Murder, which is as much as Arena 3 daggers.  So with a T5 MH and a blue OH you can do as much damage with swords as you can with 2 of the best daggers in the game.<br>
<br>
Admittedly, we are talking differences of a couple percent here, which are dwarfed by the differences in attentiveness and skill; if you find you're a lot better at playing a dagger rogue than a sword rogue, that can be enough to swing the balance.  However, assuming comparable skill and attentiveness to both builds, the sword rogue will basically always do more damage.</div>

In practice, of course, it's almost never a good idea to drop that far; however, even at the point when specials start missing, it's still a tradeoff of "how much damage do I gain from this item versus that item" - the value of hit is just a bit higher.  If you can get 10 AP for dropping 2 hit rating, it's still worth it, no matter how low your hit is.<br>

</div>Sorry, I mean the general trend from "lots of hit" to not much - I'll edit the post to be more clear with that, but when you're talking about replacing a Romulo's Poison Vial with a Tsunami Talisman or a DST, you're dropping 20-30 hit.  The idea of the post was that someone sitting at 270 hit shouldn't go "Oh, hm, I heard I shouldn't go below 270 hit, should I replace my Romulo's with a Tsunami?"  The answer is yes.<br>
<br>
And yeah, I didn't mean to jump on Hanos' recommendations, they are very solid ones (though after running my own numbers, I've seen that the S3 BP is damn close to the FLK one, and I'm now using the S3 hat since it's better than anything in T5) - I just have struggled to stomp out the 'magic number' syndrome in my own guild, and well, call it a personal crusade.<br>
<br>
<br>
And for purposes of definition, when I say "magic number", I basically mean where the graph loses continuity, and there's a noticable jump in value.  It's around those 'magic numbers' that re-evaluations of gear choices have to be made.<br>
<br>
A short list of the ones I personally believe in:<br>
- 363 hit rating - after which hit rating has a value of 0 for rogues with 5/5 precision.<br>
- 63 hit rating - below which specials miss and the value of hit rating increases noticably<br>
- 63 expertise rating w/ Weapon Expertise (or 26 TOTAL expertise) - after which theoretically you should have no dodges/parries (assuming 6.5% boss mob avoidance, which is correct for dodge according to best data so far)<br>
<br>
That's just kinda odd, how all of them have 63 in them. :P  Spooky!<br>
<br>
There's also an upper limit on Armor Penetration, but that should be ~2k on caster bosses, and ~3k on normal bosses.</div>

		<div id="post_message_570063">I'm getting back into playing rogue after someone made me a 1000g bet that I can't do 1200 dps with a rogue in T4/ZA gear (I just so happen to have a toon at close to this gear level).  I'm confident I can do this with a combat or hemo build but I am curious about mutilate.<br>
<br>
I like the idea of "solving" the mutilate/sealfate problem.  I think the way that I'll approach it is to write a combat simulator instead of the way the spreadsheet does it (which essentially calculates averages).  It may take many trials of the simulator to get results that converge, but there's also value in knowing how much a spec can vary based on luck.  A simulator makes it much easier to factor conditionals associated with the luck-based nature of mutilate.. you can make 4cp with 60 energy perform a different action than 4cp with 0 energy.. or based on how much SnD is left.<br>
<br>
I think what's really missing from the mutilate modeling is understanding how to best utilize find weakness.  Are there ways to leverage a lot of abilities in a short window of find weakness and then spend some time letting energy recharge to be able to do cycles in bursts (without ever letting SnD down, of course)?  I don't think this is the kind of thing that you can model easily in the spreadsheet.  <br>
<br>
This isn't a promise that I'll write such a simulator.. but I will think seriously about it. =)</div>

</div>No, it's not, and this is why I've been toying with the idea of writing a DPS simulator for quite a while now. The issue is that there are quite a wide variety of procs and abilities that need to be properly modeled to obtain an accurate simulation. It's a non-trivial task, and most rogue mechanics are straightforward enough that closed form evaluation is satisfactory, hence why you don't see a plethora of rogue DPS simulators around.</div>

While it might be viable in terms of banging out custom calculations, I think it would be impractical for doing a gear-comparison type computation where you need to run your damage estimates many times.  I think a better approach would be to write a program to do the statistical analysis, taking into account the exact probability distributions and their variance in addition to the mean (which is all most of these spreadsheets use).  With such an approach you could be every bit as accurate as a simulation, with the added benefit of not requiring hundreds of hours of simulated combat per damage computation.  The down side is that such a program would be a great deal of work to write... which is the primary reason I haven't done it yet.

		<div id="post_message_570228">Even Mutilate I think is better done statistically than via simulation.  I've actually worked out about 75% of the behavior by hand before; it's just never been worth taking the time to include that information in a spreadsheet.<br>
<br>
In terms of writing a computer program to do this statistically: I'd be willing to write the actual computation package for it myself, but there's a lot of code around that that would need to be written as well.  I mean, here's an overview of what would be involved in the ideal rogue calculator:<br>
<br>
1) UI for entering gear and talents.  Ideally this would also include an Armory fetch so you can point it at your Armory Profile and it automatically grabs your gear and spec.  Would also have a full talent calculator page where you can adjust your spec, and a way of changing out gear (probably something akin to the old CTProfiles).<br>
<br>
2) Total up all stats, procs, etc. etc. from gear, and pass that information into the damage calculator.  Damage calculator chews on it a bit and spits out a damage estimate.<br>
<br>
3) For each stat (or maybe each piece of gear, or perhaps both) you rerun the damage calculation for your gear with one additional point in that stat.  You use this to score each stat; then, you run these scores against an item database to get a rough score for each piece of gear to build a list of "these pieces of gear are good".<br>
<br>
4) Then, for each of those pieces of gear, you run the damage calculator again, to get the exact upgrade from using that piece of gear versus what you're wearing.  You then use this to build a list of "if you swap out this one piece of gear, this is the benefit you'd expect to get.<br>
<br>
5) You display a list for each slot consisting of "this is how good the item is in an abstract sense, and this is how good it would be for you" - i.e., if you're hit-capped, items with high hit would still show as "good" but not an upgrade for you.<br>
<br>
6) Ideally, you also add zone filters and the like to restrict the list of gear it returns, and other such nice features.  Note also that socketing adds a lot of complexity to the above.<br>
<br>
So, you'll note that this contains a lot of sorting and UI-type work above and beyond the actual calculator; the damage calculator itself, while perhaps the more technically sophisticated piece that requires the most knowledge, is probably less than half of the actual code that needs to be written.  The rest doesn't require any particular patience or even that much coding sophistication; just lots and lots of time and effort. <br>
<br>
Note also that you can get away without a lot of the fancy UI tweaks and gismos, but you fundamentally do need:<br>
<br>
a) A way of entering your gear<br>
b) A way of entering your spec<br>
and<br>
c) A way of displaying a damage number and an upgrades list<br>
<br>
even if you do nothing else - and that's still work.<br>
<br>
So, yeah.  You probably only need one programmer with actual understanding of the mechanics and statistics that go into the DPS calculations - and I'd be willing to be that one - but you'd still need some people to invest the time and effort to write all the rest as well.</div>

		<div id="post_message_570278">Well, I could probably write this in any reasonable programming language (no Befunge or Intercal, thanks) - but were it up to me, I'd probably use Python.  In particular, I've been doing quite a bit of stuff with Django (a python-based web framework) at work lately, so the natural way of approaching this problem - at least for me - would be to set it up as a webapp written in Django with the underlying computation done in Python.  I'm open to suggestions, though.<br>
<br>
In terms of actual implementation details - we should probably adjourn to private messages (or, if enough people get interested, make a thread for it rather than taking over this one), but, under the above design philosophy of doing this with Django and Python, the natural inputs would probably be dictionaries, one for gear and one for spec. And I suppose at some point you'd also need to track race, buffs/debuffs, opponent armor values, and a few other such things.  Some design work would need to go into figuring out what gets tracked where if this were actually going to be made to happen at some point.<br>
<br>
Oh, and as long as we're dreaming: in a totally ideal world, the UI and general framework would want to be written in a class-independant way, such that if, sometime down the road, people were feeling ambitious, they could write a damage calculator and a talent page and without changing the underlying framework generate a similar calculator for another class.<br>
<br>
In short: there's a fair amount of thought and design that would need to go into this if one wanted to truly do it right.  I've thought through some of the issues, but there's plenty I haven't; if this project has the support to actually get off the ground, we'd need to talk over these various issues and work them out before we started coding in a serious way.</div>

Of course, the other side of the situation is that I'm somewhat partial to the idea of building out a website around rogue theorycraft, as I can think of a number of other features that would fun to add beyond the gear optimizer.

I'd imagine that by the time you obtain 2/5 T6 you likely will have T5-T6 equivalents that would be pound for pound better than the T4 counterparts plus the bonus. Ultimately, it will depend upon your gear configuration and available options. I'd recommend looking into the Rogue Gear Spreadsheet, as it helps to alleviate guess work and is an indispensable tool in choosing a strategy for gear selection.</div>

</div>It is basically always more important to keep 100% SnD uptime than anything else.  If you worked hard enough coming up with a wierd gear combination you might be able to find one where that isn't true, but it's a good rule of thumb.  SnD generates more damage per unit time than Rupture does.<br>

</div>Generally not, actually, for two reasons:<br>
<br>
1) By the time you're at 2/5 T6, you generally have T5-equivalent gear in almost all slots; and for most people, dropping two pieces of T5 for T4 is a larger damage loss than what you gain from T4 2/5.<br>
<br>
2) As your gear level increases into the T6 range, the value of T4 2/5 decreases.<br>
<br>
Now, if you're in a situation where, for instance, you've picked up T6 gloves and helm but are still using T4 shoulders since Void Reaver hasn't cooperated, you could imagine using T4 legs for the set bonus until you got a shoulder upgrade.  But this is pretty rare, on the whole; as a general rule of thumb, using 2/5 T4 until 4/5 T5 and then abandoning it forever is the way to go.<br>
<br>
I'd also encourage you to work through the Rogue Gear Spreadsheet a bit; for whatever gear you're currently wearing, it will tell you the exact upgrade provided by each piece of gear and each set bonus, allowing you to work this out exactly for your particular case.</div>

</div>I do one of two things.  I either pop the rupture (if it will let me) early to help maintain my SnD cycle or sometimes, if the fight is very static (morogrim, winterchill), I just SS until the rupture is down and lose combo points essntially.  \<br>
<br>
It's usually a case-by-case decision, what I'm feeling in the fight and how secure I am in keeping my SnD up the whole time.  I'd say "do what feels right to you right then".  Cause sometimes popping that rupture early to maintain your SnD will seem right, and sometimes just waiting on it will seem right too.  <br>

		<div id="post_message_571849">I'd just remind people of the fundamental rules of rogue DPS:<br>
<br>
1) Never let SnD go down<br>
2) Never let your energy cap out.<br>
<br>
So, if you can afford to autoattack for a few seconds without your energy capping out, you should do that.  If, on the other hand, your energy is within a tick of capping out, you have your 5 CPs, and Rupture is still ticking (which, honestly, should be pretty rare), it is generally probably best to refresh the rupture (assuming you're doing a 2/5 T4-type cycle, i.e. 1s5r, which you pretty much have to be if this is coming up... if somehow you get into this situation doing 3s5r or 4s5r, the answer is different).  The other reasonable alternative is to toss an extra SS, but my gut feeling is that that is inferior.<br>
<br>
If you're regularly and persistently having this problem, what you probably want to do is switch to 2s5r and burn the extra SnD time.</div>

		<div id="post_message_571868">It depends on how close you want to cut it, and how good your latency is.  I mean, theoretically: if you hit the finisher the instant your energy ticks over 80, you have time to launch the first SS of the next cycle before the next energy tick, so you never clip any ticks; that is:<br>
<br>
0.0: Energy ticks up to 90<br>
0.1: Rupture for 25 energy; Relentless Strikes for 25 energy - still at 90 energy<br>
1.1: Global cooldown back up<br>
1.2: First SS of new cycle; 50 energy.<br>
2.0: Next energy tick; energy at 70<br>
<br>
Now, the issue here, of course, is that Combat Potency can screw this up; if you get a combat potency tick between 0.0 and 1.2, *that* gets clipped.  So in practice, letting your energy tick above 80 while waiting for a finisher is a bad idea with combat potency (or if you have 4/5 T5, or whatever).  But if you've been mashing and your energy is at 10 when you get your 5th combo point... you can still afford to wait 6 seconds, letting your energy tick up to 70, and then perform the above manuever, such that even if you get 2 combat potency procs in the 1.2 second window, you're still fine.

				<div style="font-style:italic">Quick question for you long time Sword players. Recently I switched over from daggers to swords and i am finding one problem. Every once in awhile, without AR, i will Build up 5 Combo points and still have a good amount of time of my rupture still up. Lets say between 4 and 6 seconds. So my question is what do you guys do? Do you keep SSIng until the rupture finishes or do you just auto attack then uses the rupture as soon as it drops? This is a problem you never really have as a dagger rogue.</div>

	</table>
</div>Wait and autoattack.  Your energy buffer takes a full 10 seconds to fill up from empty.  You should easily be able to absorb 4-6 seconds "wait time" without any loss of energy.  Hit the rupture at the right time, and you'll have energy free to spam SS and drain your pool down again.<br>
<br>
If you're constantly finding yourself with a full energy pool <i>and</i> the need to wait for rupture, then you have a problem.  Best option is to use an extra SS and waste the combo point - it's better than letting your energy tick beyond 100% and thus losing energy.  If this is happening to you often, check out the DPS spreadsheet or gear spreadsheet (or both) and make sure you're using the optimal cycle.</div>

		<div id="post_message_571942">Just to add to what Ald said (which I completely agree with).. If you are using the BT exalted trinket - this works out even better in your favor.  You now can squeeze more SS's into your crit-proc time.<br>
<br>
And yea.. whatever you do, the biggest things by far are: (as Ald mentioned a few posts above)<br>
1) Never let SnD go down<br>
2) Never let your energy cap out.<br>
<br>
If you can afford to auto attack without breaking rule #1 or #2, do it and rupture as soon as the old one ends.<br>
If you can't afford to auto attack (energy nearly capped).. check your SnD timer.  If you are in danger of breaking rule #1, rupture if you can (if it won't let you.. less AP now than when you applied the first rupture) you'll likely have to evis <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302184124im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/frown.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":(" class="inlineimg">.  If you aren't in danger of breaking rule #1, I generally wait until ~80 energy and then pop in an extra (6th) SS.  Basically treating it as an "excess energy burnoff" - similar to a warrior tank Heroic Striking to burn off extra rage.  Perhaps doing the rupture thing early even if you aren't in danger of dropping SnD will be better - I'm not sure.. but it won't be a big difference either way.  Just make sure rule #1 and #2 are followed.<br>
<br>
Hopefully that was readable....</div>

This allows me to store energy until after the finisher so that I can get more sinister strikes in during the trinket buff.

At 5 CP, Rupture deals 1000 damage plus 24% of your AP for 25 energy, or 40 damage plus 0.96% of your AP per energy. At 5 CP and with T5 2pc, Eviscerate deals 1245 damage plus 15% of your AP for 35 energy, or roughly 35.57 damage plus 0.43% of your AP per energy. <b>Applying 3/3 Improved Eviscerate and 3/3 Aggression (121% modifier), 40% crit and RED (142.4% modifier), and 30% armor reduction (assuming a typical debuffed raid boss)</b>, Eviscerate comes to 42.90 damage plus 0.52% of your AP per energy. Thus, Eviscerate holds an advantage of 2.90 base damage per energy, but Rupture gains an additional 0.44% of your AP. At this rate, it takes only 656 AP for Rupture to overcome Eviscerate's base advantage. Simply, in any situation where you can Rupture, you should Rupture.<br>
<br>
On Envenom: Envenom damage is not mitigated by armor, and can be boosted by Stormstrike, Misery (shadow priest debuff), and Vile Poisons. However, in all but the most favorable circumstances (for example, extremely high crit, T5 2pc, RED, 5/5 Vile, Stormstrike and Misery both up), Envenom's DPE will be inferior to Rupture. The more apt comparison to make is Envenom versus Eviscerate. At 5 CP and untalented (talents can boost both abilities by roughly the same: Envenom by 20%, Eviscerate by 21%), Envenom 2 deals 900 base damage plus 15% of AP, while Eviscerate deals 1045 damage plus 15% of AP. However, Eviscerate damage is mitigated by armor, which is typically roughly 30% damage reduction by a raid boss. Thus, Envenom is, at base, slightly better straight-up DPE than Eviscerate. However, Envenom results in the loss of your entire DP stack, resulting in a drop of roughly 45 DPS (before Vile Poisons) for as long as it takes to get the full stack up again. A Mutilate build running dual DP can get enough DPS out of Envenom and DP to make it worthwhile to use. However, for other builds, if you must choose between Eviscerate and Envenom, choose Eviscerate.</div>

Note that for each point you spend in Vile Poisons, the damage of your Envenom increases, but so does the damage you lose from having to refresh your Deadly Poison stacks afterwards. I'm sure there's a point where Envenom's damage increase over Eviscerate scales to the point where it's worthwhile to use it, but as it is Eviscerate/Envenom are highly situational finishers.

</div>So I'm a dying breed? Thanks for pointing out the points I missed in the first post (I thought I was paying more attention when reading :/ ). I'm 41/20/0 and I'm currently at T4/ZA level. Used to go Gruul, Maggy, SSC/TK (first bosses) on a weekly basis but only doing 10 mans now (with a 25man IF we're lucky to get ppl). Anyway, the reason I'm asking:<br>
<br>
Like everyone else with this build, I find it easy to keep SnD up constantly during boss fights and rupture is on 80-90% of the time. What should the third finisher be? I use evisc most of the time and envenom when I got 5 poison charges ticking (sometimes it's just decided by what I feel like doing). Currently I have both Imp Evisc and Vile Poisons. Would switching imp evisc to murder make a bigger impact on DPS? Should envenom be used at all since it eats the poison ticks?<br>
<br>
And the final question: Why is combat-mutilate considered so low on DPS for raiding? Does the -?% on the first post mean it's between -7% and -11% or is that just an estimation as to where mutilate MIGHT be but without any hard evidence on what the % reduction is?</div>

</div>Indeed.  However, an interesting point is that the situation when you have to use Eviscerate (i.e. when rupture won't have time to tick out) is exactly the same situation that makes Envenom &gt; Eviscerate (i.e. when the DP stack won't have time to tick).  Thus my preference for the poison talents in a combat build (4 points spare) is to put them in Vile Poisons rather than Improved Poisons, even though the spreadsheet says the optimal choice is 2 points in each talent.</div>

</div>Actually, I wasn't even considering that situation. I was considering the situation where the mob is immune to bleeds. Funny thing there, though, is that the two most notorious bleed-immune targets (Hydross and Void Reaver) are also poison-immune, and therefore Envenom isn't usable anyway.<br>
<br>
Your reasoning for the situation you mentioned is definitely valid. Personally I spend the points in Vile Poisons as well, mostly due to educated guesswork, but even my own spreadsheet only puts them a very very small amount ahead of Improved Poisons.<br>

</div>You have two options: run dual DP and use Envenom, or run IP/DP and use Eviscerate. If you only have DP on one hand, even Mutilate can't grant you enough DP procs to make up for losing the DP stack on an Envenom. If you have DP on both hands, you're losing a pretty good chunk of potential DPS from IP just to get a questionable amount of gain from switching your <i>third</i> priority finisher from Eviscerate to Envenom. Either way I highly doubt it's actually worth it.<br>

</div>Essentially, empirical testing has shown it's inferior to combat, and that's as good as we know, because no solid model of Seal Fate currently exists. The DPS spreadsheet's model is bugged and even if it were fixed, Seal Fate is still a touchy thing to model. So to answer your second question, yes, the -?% indicates that I have no clue where it actually ranks and just took a guess that it's probably inferior to those other builds, but superior to Shadowstep.</div>

Oddly, this is somewhat reversed now.  In purely sustained fights where swords can maintain cycles like 3s5r and keep very high rupture uptime, they blow past daggers.  It is in interrupted fights where swords have a hard time maintaining tight cycles that daggers have the ability to compete, as dagger builds are much less reliant on rupture and much more reliant on simply keeping SnD up and backstabbing. Hence, to the extent a dagger rogue is going to be able to keep up at all, it's going to be on trash and interrupted fights, not on purely sustained fights.  Which is exactly reversed from what it was pre-BC, but that's the way it goes.</div>

</div>In theory, I agree here. However, in practice it seems that a lot of fights which are interrupted/mobile hit the second problem with daggers: positioning. (At least, this is true in the 10 man content I have seen.) For example, I had a hell of a time backstabbing the sparks on Curator, or backstabbing Aran when he turned to cast. I've also noticed that totems don't have a "back", making any positional sort of build inferior to a non-positional one on Lynx Lord Halazzi in ZA. I actually have a macro right now that switches me to a sword so I can sinister strike the totems, then switch back to daggers for Mutilate on Halazzi.</div>

		<div id="post_message_572796">What am I going to do with this thread is over time establish the effectiveness of both the mongoose and executioner enchants for rogues. First will be the individual comparisons that will eventually include my own studied PPM, then when combining them.<br>
<br>
As a rogue, it takes ~14 AP in order to increase our DPS by 1. That being said at AP of (see below) you get an increase to DPS of (see second number<br>
AP: DPS:<br>
1400 100<br>
1500 107<br>
1600 114<br>
1700 121<br>
1800 129<br>
1900 136<br>
2000 143<br>
You can kinda see a pattern here, 100 AP = ~7 DPS increase, now with that being said we all know that mongoose proccing gives a 120 agility increase which is 3% to crit and ~9 DPS increase.<br>
Now let us calculate the % of damage increased when mongoose procs<br>
AP: DPS:<br>
1400 9%<br>
1500 8.4%<br>
1600 7.8%<br>
1700 7.4%<br>
1800 7%<br>
1900 6.6%<br>
2000 6.3%<br>
As you can see, mongoose gives diminishing returns the higher your AP gets.<br>
<br>
Let us now look at executioner. What this gives you is 840 armor penetration. A fully debuffed boss will give you -4010 armor reduction (2600 for 5 sunders, 610 for faerie fire, 800 for Curse of Recklessness) I do not believe that we use CoR so our fully debuffed mob will be at -3210 armor. Here is the armor value for most high end bosses.<br>
<br>
Serpentshrine Cavern:<br>
Hydross the Unstable: 7700<br>
The Lurker Below: 7700<br>
Leotheras the Blind: 7700<br>
Fathom-Lord Karathress 6200<br>
Morogrim Tidewalker: 7700<br>
Lady Vashj: 6200<br>
<br>
Tempest Keep:<br>
Void Reaver: 8800<br>
High Astromancer Solarian: 6200<br>
Al'ar: 7700<br>
Kael'thas Sunstrider: 6200<br>
<br>
Hyjal Summit:<br>
Rage Winterchill: 6200<br>
Anetheron: 6200<br>
Kaz'rogal: 6200<br>
Azgalor: 6200<br>
Archimonde: 6200<br>
<br>
Black Temple:<br>
High Warlord Naj'entus: 7700<br>
Supremus: 7700<br>
Shade of Akama: 7700<br>
Teron Gorefiend: 6200<br>
Gurtogg Bloodboil: 7700<br>
Reliquary of Souls:<br>
- Essence of Suffering: 0<br>
- Essence of Desire: 7700<br>
- Essence of Anger: 7700<br>
Mother Shahraz: 6200<br>
Illidari Council:<br>
- Gathios the Shatterer: 6200<br>
Illidan Stormrage: 7700<br>
<br>
As we can see, on average most bosses have either 6200/7700 armor, minus VR who is at 8800. What this means is that the mitigation done by a lvl 70 attacker is going to be R = (Ar)/(Ar + B)*100<br>
where<br>
R=damage reduction<br>
Ar=armor<br>
B=(467.5*Enemy Level - 22167.5) = 11960 for a 73 mob or 10557.5 for a 70 mob<br>
So the damage reduction for a mob with x armor is equal to y reduction<br>
X: Y:<br>
6200 36.34%<br>
7700 39.16%<br>
8800 42.38%<br>
So lets take out the -3210 armor that we should have from sunders and FF<br>
X: Y:<br>
2900 19.51%<br>
4490 27.29%<br>
5590 31.85%<br>
NOW for the part that we've all been waiting for! the damage increase when executioner procs on a fully debuffed boss mob.<br>
X: Y:<br>
2060 14.69%<br>
3650 23.38%<br>
4750 28.42%<br>
Thus, the damage increase for a mob with x starting armor will be y when fully debuffed and executioner proccing<br>
X: Y:<br>
6200 4.82%<br>
7700 3.91%<br>
8800 3.43%<br>
<br>
As you can see, mongoose (at least with these preliminary numbers) does do more for a rogue when looking at damage % increase.<br>
<br>
Over the next couple of weeks, I will be tracking the PPM, uptime and downtime of both my mongoose and executioner so expect more data as it develops.<br>
<br>
I tested Executioner's procs using Procwatch mod. During the Fathom-Lord Karathress fight this recorded how often it procced per hit and every second of combat.<br>
Recall:<br>
803 Hits<br>
27 Procs<br>
11:11 of Combat time<br>
which equates to ~29.7 Hits/Proc<br>
total of 2.4 PPM which translates this:<br>
Executioner on a boss fight, when consistently using SnD and attempting to hitting the target at all times, this enchant is up around 36 total seconds out of 60 seconds in a minute. These hits btw are counting my TOTAL hits, MH and OH<br>
Trash, this proc is MUCH lower, around 1.3 or so.<br>
My OH speed is at 1.15 with SnD up<br>
<br>
Mongoose is currently only on my MH, with SnD up, i run 2.00 speed<br>
On trash clearing to Fathom-Lord, here are the numbers<br>
1451 Hits<br>
58 Procs<br>
21:21 Mins of Combat Time<br>
which equates to ~25 Hits/Proc<br>
total of 2.7 PPM which translates (on trash) to:<br>
Mongoose on trash, when consistenly used with SnD, will run about 40.5 seconds out of a total of 60 seconds per minute.<br>
On Fathom-Lord Karathress, here are the stats (remember that there is some running + wipes, etc etc STFU already!!!!)<br>
692 Hits<br>
27 Procs<br>
10:13 Mins of Combat<br>
which is equal to ~ 25.6 Hits/Proc<br>
total of 2.6 PPM which translates (onto the boss) to this:<br>
Mongoose on Fathom-Lord Karathress (remember that we did have to run around A LOT), when consistently used with SnD will run about 39 seconds out of a total of 60 seconds per minute.<br>
One thing to remember about the proccing of mongoose is it is on my MH only, OH had executioner at the time I was testing.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">The DPS spreadsheet's model is bugged and even if it were fixed, Seal Fate is still a touchy thing to model. So to answer your second question, yes, the -?% indicates that I have no clue where it actually ranks and just took a guess that it's probably inferior to those other builds, but superior to Shadowstep.</div>

</div>This may seem like a completely retarded question, one that has probably been answered numerous times to supposed-do-gooders......<br>
<br>
but, why is it not possible to take the idea of seal fate to a math-guru/theorist and have them try and make an accurate model?  I know we have some computer/programming experts and even some calc stars (I was fairly good at calc) but as far as modeling something in a mathematical approach, seems like we might have to get someone who does this for a living.  <br>
<br>
I'd be more than willing to look into it, if someone would lay out WHY the previous attempts didn't work.  As far as the talent goes, it seems straight forward.  When maxed out, 100% of your critical strikes, per your crit strike %, will add an extra combo point.  Couldn't we take a a general concensus of attacks total per average bossfight (I'm guessing around 750-1000) and then multiply in the crit chance (Higher for BS's and such) and then take the number of added combo points over an average fight and then factor in the gains in DPS?  OR on a totally different avenue, possibly look at a normal 2-3 finisher cycle and model based on that (allowing more specificity)?<br>
<br>
<br>

It's not that it's impossible to model, it's just that we're already pretty confident that it's inferior to combat (from pretty good amounts of empirical data), and as such, going to the amount of trouble it seems like it will take to model it with the degree of accuracy to which we've modeled combat cycles and DPS doesn't seem worth the trouble. If you'd like to try for it, be our guest, as who knows whether Blizzard will suddenly make builds involving Seal Fate viable with Wrath, sending all us theorycrafters scurrying about to model it properly.</div>

</div>Wouldn't it be possible to do a short cycle build model and then extrapolate over a larger one, of course accuracy would be diminshed the larger the cycle you extrapolated it over, but it seems that looking at a "boss fight" would be impossible for a seal fate considereing all the possibilities, but looking at a much shorter encounter and trying to model the possibilities would seem more logical...</div>

		<div id="post_message_572870">I think what it fundamentally comes down to is that there are some people here (myself included) who have a pretty good idea *how* to make a decent SF model; it's just that doing so is a heck of a lot of work, and it hasn't been deemed worthwhile.  In particular, the major problem is that one needs to consider variance in addition to the average, as combo points are a lot more granular and a lot less able to smooth out burstiness of cycle.  That is, it's not enough to say "on average, each attack genrerates 1.4 combo points" - you have to model it as "40% of the time you get 2 combo points, and 60% of the time you get 1" - which means the problem pretty quickly becomes lots of case work that you ultimately average together.  There's nothing fundamentally hard about doing so: it's just a very long, messy calculation that no one has felt like doing, because no one expects to demonstrate anything other than "SF builds are clearly inferior" - which we already know.<br>
<br>
Also, I might note that a spreadsheet format is singularly ill-suited for the task.  If the aforementioned programming-language based approach ever turns in to something, I'd probably throw a SF model in because it would be slightly less painful to do in that format; but in terms of doing it in a spreadsheet, it's just really not worth the effort in my estimation.</div>

		<div id="post_message_572947">Hey I was wondering if you could help me choose my offhand weapon. I recently respecced to combat, the plan is to go sword when i get a good main hand sword. But for now I am the typical 20/41/5 combat dagger spec. I am finding the dps is great but I was wondering about my weapons. I am currently using Malchazeen and Blade of the Unrequited (with three+8 hit gems in) both with mongoose. In my bags I have the season 2 offhand sword. It is a fast weapon than my current offhand with alot more dps aswell but obviously my weapon spec is dagger at the moment, which would be better?<br>
<br>
Also there is the option of buying the mainhand sword from the aldor and going sword spec now. But obviously the dps on the aldor sword is far below that of Malchazeen.<br>
<br>
So basically should I change anything or just stick with the dagger until I get Spiteblade/season 2 MH/ZA MH?</div>

<br>
I'm going to guess that aldor sword + s2 oh will be more dps than you think, and depending on the fight where BS's might be an issue, I'd say it pulls ahead quite a bit.  But again, try the spreadsheet and see what happens..you'd be amazed at the wonders it can do.</div>

</div>To the best of my knowledge (and let me be VERY honest by saying that we are still VERY unsure about Executioner except in a broad "it's about as good as mongoose" sense), this is how I personally break it down.<br>
<br>
Ex/Mongoose = Mongoose/Ex = Mongoose/Mongoose &gt;&gt; Ex/Ex<br>
<br>
That is - Executioner and Mongoose are both strong, and both strong on the mainhand, so it's more personal preference at this time.  They're both (as far as we can tell) PPM procs, so mainhand will proc more, regardless of speed (due to instant attacks with the mainhand).<br>
<br>
Please note that Ex/Ex is fairly weak due to the funky mechanics it has with overwriting/renewing itself instead of stacking.  Unless this changes, my opinion is that Ex/Ex is very inferior to the other options.<br>
<br>
It's my personal guess that as you move into more Armor Penetration gear (ZA and T6) that Executioner on the MH will start to outperform Mongoose.  This is due to Armor Penetration improving all rogue stats, including itself, so as you get more ArmorPen, it's more powerful (up till you're putting a target's armor at 0).  This makes the final graph for T6 rogues look like:<br>
<br>
Ex/Mongoose &gt; Mongoose/Ex &gt; Mongoose/Mongoose &gt;&gt; Ex/Ex.   <br>
<br>
Again this is all "educated speculation" at this point, but (to my knowledge) it's the best we have.  If you have concrete information about Executioner other than "Wow I feel like it's up a lot!" please post in the Executioner thread on these boards.</div>

</div>All the testing I did purely involved Ex in the OH, so unfortunately I can't tell you. As stated, we believe that it is a PPM, but looking into it, I'm not 100% sure about it, just based on the numbers. The thing with Ex is that if you check out the debuffed armor of bosses, it increases your overall damage by up to ~5% at any range of AP. When proccing Goose you have to remember that the higher your AP, the less increase you will get. The thing that I like about Goose is the fact that it also increases my rupture damage, Ex only helps your Evis finisher.</div>

When Executioner was first announced I did a rough estimate in the Rogue Gear sheet and concluded that if Exec and Mong had the same proc rate, Exec would be slightly more damage, but on a small enough scale that you could argue for Mongoose based on the extra dodge it gives (yes, they're that close together).  If this assumption is valid, then, it's easy to show that Exec MH Mong OH maximizes DPS.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">So I'm a dying breed? Thanks for pointing out the points I missed in the first post (I thought I was paying more attention when reading :/ ). I'm 41/20/0 and I'm currently at T4/ZA level. Used to go Gruul, Maggy, SSC/TK (first bosses) on a weekly basis but only doing 10 mans now (with a 25man IF we're lucky to get ppl). Anyway, the reason I'm asking:<br>
<br>
Like everyone else with this build, I find it easy to keep SnD up constantly during boss fights and rupture is on 80-90% of the time. What should the third finisher be? I use evisc most of the time and envenom when I got 5 poison charges ticking (sometimes it's just decided by what I feel like doing). Currently I have both Imp Evisc and Vile Poisons. Would switching imp evisc to murder make a bigger impact on DPS? Should envenom be used at all since it eats the poison ticks?<br>
<br>
And the final question: Why is combat-mutilate considered so low on DPS for raiding? Does the -?% on the first post mean it's between -7% and -11% or is that just an estimation as to where mutilate MIGHT be but without any hard evidence on what the % reduction is?</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</div>I've been playing mutilate throughout most of TBC and the only time you should be Envenoming on a boss is when you want to see "Big Numbers" or have a pvp spec (53/0/7 or a variant) or as the last finisher at 1%. <br>
<br>
Finisher preference has always been SnD &gt; Rupture &gt; Eviscerate for me.<br>
<br>
Poison choice should be WF/DP or IP/DP.<br>
I haven't experimented with DP/IP, which, presuming that you have enough hit to keep Deadly rolling, might be better. <br>
<br>
As for the "rough" DPS estimate, I think the reason why mutilate is so low there is that there hasn't been much data gathering on it. From personal experience I can say that it's not as low as 7. But maybe that's just me.</div>

</div>On the IP/DP Vs DP/IP issue: I always use 1.8 speed daggers on both hands and I must say I haven't seen much of a difference on either setup. I currently have 245 HR. The only difference is that with DP on OH I can sometimes shiv to reset the DP timer. For instance at some fights were you have to stop DPSing and DP ticks away and you start hitting again when your 5 poison stacks are about to go out. I've read on forums and guides that shiv should almost never be used in a raid environment and I suppose a mutilate would reset the timer at that point, but it's nice to know you have control and you're not crossing your fingers for a poison proc.<br>
<br>
On WF Vs GoA: I've read somewhere around here that WF isn't THAT much better anymore (since a recent downgrade I think). Personally, I always asked for WF (cos the guides said so :/ ) when it was up to me but when I was in a group that dropped GoA I was rarely getting non crits with Mutilate (stick a druid in that equation and it's to die for). I always wondered, since seal fate is our thing, isn't GoA at least on par with WF for assassination rogues?</div>

Aran is probably the best example, but in general, some fights where the tanks move around a bit, like Gruul, sinister strike can help you not waste energy if you can't get around in time. In those cases it is better to use sinister strike than let the energy be wasted, or just use non-improve sinsiter strike. Those talent points are "spare" anyway, it doesn't matter that much where I put them. But if you still disagree, I would like to hear the arguments, which is why I asked in the first place.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic"> On Eviscerate: at nearly all reachable levels of gear, Rupture will be superior to Eviscerate on any target that isn't immune to bleeds. At 5 CP, Rupture deals 1000 damage plus 24% of your AP for 25 energy, or 40 damage plus 0.96% of your AP per energy. At 5 CP and with T5 2pc, Eviscerate deals 1245 damage plus 15% of your AP for 35 energy, or roughly 35.57 damage plus 0.43% of your AP per energy. Applying 3/3 Improved Eviscerate and 3/3 Aggression (121% modifier), 40% crit and RED (142.4% modifier), and 30% armor reduction (assuming a typical debuffed raid boss), Eviscerate comes to 42.90 damage plus 0.52% of your AP per energy. Thus, Eviscerate holds an advantage of 2.90 base damage per energy, but Rupture gains an additional 0.44% of your AP. At this rate, it takes only 656 AP for Rupture to overcome Eviscerate's base advantage. Simply, in any situation where you can Rupture, you should Rupture.</div>

</div>Konnichiwa ^_^<br>
<br>
Excellent post, I had a couple questions about Eviscerate and how well it scales with armor ignore. First though, I've read through this bit a couple times from the OP and I still don't understand what RED is referring to here: "Applying 3/3 Improved Eviscerate and 3/3 Aggression (121% modifier), 40% crit and RED (142.4% modifier), and 30% armor reduction (assuming a typical debuffed raid boss), Eviscerate comes to 42.90 damage plus 0.52% of your AP per energy."<br>
<br>
So, my question is that I just got the Warpspring Coil in addition to t5 2 set bonus, so factoring these in with 3/3 Improved Eviscerate and 3/3 Aggression, does this come out ahead of Rupture? (if I am eviscerating while the Warpspring coil debuff is active) It seems to, but I've only been looking at my WSS and with all the various raid buffs and such it's hard for me to do a straight comparison.<br>
<br>
I used to have the Icon of Unyielding Courage, and would time my eviscerates with that which also seemed to work well.  <br>
<br>
Also, I was curious how Eviscerate with t5 2set bonus and some armor ignore, if that turned out to do more damage, how would it compare to rupture plus the mangle debuff?</div>

<br>
The answer to your question is almost certainly no. If your procs happen to coincide with your Eviscerates <i>every single time</i>, you may obtain greater long-run performance, but since that's not likely to happen, it's in your best interest to stick with Rupture.<br>
<br>
Rupture+Mangle blows Eviscerate out of the water, the AP scaling of a Rupture with Mangle is above even that of an Eviscerate crit.</div>

		<div id="post_message_574233">I suppose I could have phrased it this way (if this is any clearer):<br>
<br>
When the debuff from the Warpspring coil (or Executioner) is up, and you have t5 2set bonus, would Eviscerate be worthwhile to use/add into your normal combat rotation?<br>
<br>
The basic premise is, at what level of armor ignore (either proc based or ambient) and other bonuses from gear, would Eviscerate win out over Rupture?</div>

		<div id="post_message_574295">So, the issue with answering that question is that it depends on your crit and AP as well as your armor penetration; however, for purposes of estimation; hence it's hard to come up with a hard and fast rule.  For instance, if your opponent has no armor whatsoever, fully talented + set bonused Eviscerate will tend to be more energy efficient than totally unbuffed Mangle.  However, in practice, you rarely reduce an opponent all the way down to zero, which complicates the question.<br>
<br>
Basically, to get an intelligent answer, one must hold 2 of the 3 variables constant and find the breakpoint for the third.  So, for instance, the question "if I have 3000 AP and 40% crit, at what armor level does Eviscerate pass Rupture" can be answered - and the answer is, assuming fully talented + set bonused Evis and no Mangle or Serrated Blades, Rupture will do more damage per energy against a target that has 2289 or more armor, and Eviscerate will do more against a target that has less than that.  Which tells us that *if* you have fully optomized Eviscerate and no Mangle or Serrated Blades, it will probably make sense at times to use Eviscerate.<br>
<br>
If, on the other hand, you *do* have Mangle, than Rupture basically always wins.  Even against a target with no armor whatsoever and a 40% crit rate, it only takes 1700 AP for Rupture to match the damage output of Eviscerate - trivial for any raid-buffed rogue.  And even at 50% crit rate, Rupture catches up at 2850 AP, which is fairly common.  So if Mangle is up, Rupture is pretty much always better.<br>
<br>
Of course, this all assumes that damage per energy is the correct way of analyzing the situation.  Which, upon contemplation, it probably isn't.  But it's still probably a reasonably approximation of what's going on.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">On WF Vs GoA: I've read somewhere around here that WF isn't THAT much better anymore (since a recent downgrade I think). Personally, I always asked for WF (cos the guides said so :/ ) when it was up to me but when I was in a group that dropped GoA I was rarely getting non crits with Mutilate (stick a druid in that equation and it's to die for). I always wondered, since seal fate is our thing, isn't GoA at least on par with WF for assassination rogues?</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</div>WF was changed to not proc anymore from instant specials attacks, but only from normal hits AND from special "on next swing" (like Heroic strike/Cleave). A good extimation on wether is better to have WF vs GoA for a rogue is evaluating your white Vs yellow damage ratio: as long as your white damage is &gt;&gt; yellow  (generally true for every combat build) WF wins; with a mutilate spec, you are most likely to see higher amounts of your damage coming from specials, thus benefitting less from WF procs (procs that will also be smaller, due to the fast nature of your daggers). Add to this that Seal Fate will gain more from GoA and you see which totems fits you better <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304051216im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/wink.gif" border="0" alt="" title=";)" class="inlineimg"><br>
<br>
Problem is that all the other melee players in your group (unless its full of kittyes) will gain extremely more from WF than GoA, so it isnt usually worth the change.</div>

		<div id="post_message_575290">As a correction, WF vs GoA isn't strictly based on yellow vs white damage, but it is a good indicator.  WF and GoA are a lot closer than they've ever been for rogues, which means I personally wouldn't complain about either.  Mut does get a bit more out of GoA, but the real determination on what type of totem you get is likely going to be whether or not there's a DPS warrior in your group.   See the Enhance thread in this forum for more details.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I manage a WF rank 2 rotation with a max rank GoA fine. If your Shaman doesn't have the gear/consumable usage to do this, he should work out whether 88 agility is more overall raidDPS than his shock rotation and prioritise whichever is higher when he's mana constrained (it is most likely totem twisting).<br>
<br>
One thing to clarify though: GoA can't be up for 100% of the time due to the GCD. The best you can hope for without losing WF Totem is 81%.</div>

</div>When is "at some point?"  No change is mentioned in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304051216/http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/patchnotes/test-realm-patchnotes.html" target="_blank">the tentative 2.3 patch notes</a> yet the common response to totem twisting is always "it's not worth talking about because it will be fixed soon."  The last time I suggested Vulajin include this topic in his front page post was mid-October and I was given the same response.  Hemorrhage, on the other hand, has seen a flurry of changes recently and is kept rather up-to-date.  The "insight" of my post is that using both totems is possible and will likely remain possible for quite some time.  I don't understand why it is ignored and dismissed.</div>

		<div id="post_message_576647">Well, the question being asked is "which is better, WF or GoA".  Saying "both" is not a useful answer - it's obviously better, but if the shaman in question considered "both" to be a valid option, he wouldn't even be asking.  The fact that he's asking implies he feels he can only do one or the other, meaning that answering "both" is not helpful.<br>
<br>
For instance, in my guild, totems are usually coming from resto shamans that have better things to do with their time/mana - like, for instance, heal.  So the question of "which, by itself, is better, WF or GoA" is highly relevant.<br>
<br>
Thus: it's not so much that it's ignored or dismissed as that it is not always applicable and, in those cases where it is applicable, it is so obvious that people don't ask.</div>

The relative importance of these totems to each other should be understood.

There are far more obvious instructions and advice given by the senior, well-respected posters here that I feel including the possibility of twisting is justified.</div>

If you only get WF or GoA, that discussion is rogue-focused as to which we should ask for (though it is STILL a shaman issue and is also covered in their thread), if you are saying we should discuss it to bring tell new shaman they should be using it, I'd link them to the shaman discussion instead of the rogue one.<br>
<br>
The Enhance shaman in my guild doesn't do it because she feels like it's exploitative - while I agree that I'm not going to report anyone for using it, I certainly believe that it's also a totally valid point to not use it because it's unintended.<br>
<br>
To respond to your hemo point - theorycraft integrates with future changes near-immediately - people stopped talking about 125% hemo pretty much the moment that the 110% hemo change was announced (even before the change to the debuff was known, though the real math waited till afterwards).  Totem twisting may be around for a while, but it's a 'lame duck' mechanic.</div>

</div>1. Most people who use Mutilate tend to run 4+ cycles. The deal with FW, as you could have found out in the first post, is you want to have almost every finishing move/Mutilate within FW uptime. To do so you'll want to wait to launch your "next" finisher until you either a. Have full Energy (Assuming no 4pc T5 here), or b. FW is about to run out (0 Seconds left), thereby allowing you to Mutilate back up to 4+ combo points, wait, then launch your next finisher, repeating the process while keeping FW up 100% of the time. Sometimes you might get incredibly unlucky strings of non-crits, but this is pretty rare and Cold Blood helps nicely in those situations to allow you to continue this 'cycle'. <br>
<br>
2. 41/20/0 outdamages 4x/0/x or pretty much any other conceivable Mutilate spec. <br>

It is a basic question really:<br>
<br>
For a sword spec combat rogue, the main hand needs to be a slow SWORD that hits hard.  That is clear.<br>
<br>
Now, the off hand, does it NEED to be a sword also (to take advantage of the sword specialization), or can it be anything else (dagger, or mace, or fist weapon) as long as it is fast?  The fastest OH weapons i found until now (I am level 49 atm) are daggers (Julie's Dagger is 1.30 speed). <br>

		<div id="post_message_577657">I asked about the 3CP dilemma earlier in the thread and now, based on some personal experiments, I'd be willing to say going for the 5CP is more beneficial. Simplified, you're sacrificing a potential SF proc (~40-60% chance, depending on gear level) in order to get a guaranteed Relentless proc (+40% chance compared to 3CP). Yes, the extra Mutilate won't probably fit into your current FW timer, but after the finisher your next two will. It might be arguable if it's worthwhile to do so when you're trying to refresh rupture (obviously SnD gains nothing from FW), but I prefer the steadier "cycles" the increased Relentless procs give either way, especially when your crit chance isn't exactly sky-high.<br>
<br>
And about gemming your Mutilate gear, while I'm pretty sure <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304051216/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=24028"><span  ><span class="bluename">[Delicate Living Ruby]</span></span></a> is the best choice for a red slot, the relation of crit and hit for yellow slots remains hazy. I was using <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304051216/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=24061"><span  ><span class="bluename">[Glinting Noble Topaz]</span></span></a> with what I considered fairly good results (beat <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304051216/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=31868"><span  ><span class="bluename">[Wicked Noble Topaz]</span></span></a> by a longshot at least), but in very mobile fights I would've wished for a better crit chance since, e.g. after Lurker re-emerges, getting back to the point where you have both SnD and Rupture running smoothly could take rather long (taken, my gear was mostly from G'eras and Karazhan). Could this be solved by using a certain cycle while re-engaging and/or is there simply a better way of gemming for Mutilate in general?</div>

For a sword spec combat rogue, the main hand needs to be a slow SWORD that hits hard.  That is clear.<br>
<br>
Now, the off hand, does it NEED to be a sword also (to take advantage of the sword specialization), or can it be anything else (dagger, or mace, or fist weapon) as long as it is fast?  The fastest OH weapons i found until now (I am level 49 atm) are daggers (Julie's Dagger is 1.30 speed). <br>

</div>I used a dagger off-hand as swords for a week while I was waiting for points for my S2 off-hand, and the results were still pretty decent. But considering that an off-hand sword spec proc is probably the strongest thing about sword spec, your daggers would have to be much better than any other available swords.</div>

</div>The slow/fast offhand priority only really comes into play when you have combat potency where, as far as i can tell from throwing different weapons into the spreadsheet, a fast, non-sword offhand will outdps a slow sword offhand.  For levelling i wouldnt really worry too much about gearing perfectly for combat potency/ weapon specs as in short fights the difference can be quite minimal i imagine.  Just go with the best weapons you find while levelling and then look at gearing properly once your 70<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304051216im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":)" class="inlineimg"></div>

		<div id="post_message_577935">QUESTION 1: Ok, I have beyond 64 hit rating, am combat swords specced, 5/5 precision.<br>
<br>
According to what Valujin says, you've maxed out your chance to hit ON SPECIAL ATTACKS if you have 64 HIT RATING and 5/5 opportunity.<br>
<br>
He assigned a weighted value (2.28) for each point of your HIT RATING to figure out your DPS.<br>
<br>
Does that assigned weight remain the same if your moving your HIT RATING beyond the SPECIAL ATTACK MAX (in other words you have 100% chance to hit with special attacks, so does adding more to your HIT RATING beyond that still contribue a weight of 2.28 toward your DPS?  One would think that the weight of 2.28 would go down a bit)<br>
<br>
QUESTION 2:  If the answer is no, than do any of you math savants (compared to me hehe) have a new weight that you can assign toward your DPS for each point of HIT RATING that goes beyond the SPECIAL ATTACK cap of 64</div>

Below the yellow hit cap, hit is worth somewhat more.</div>

		<div id="post_message_577953">First off, I'll assume you mean 5/5 Precision, not opportunity.  If you have opportunity as a sword rogue.. not only are you not spec'd Combat Swords, you are an idiot.<br>
<br>
Hit cap is dependant on what you are attacking.  Hit cap against equal level players (such as in PvP) is lower than against lvl 73's (bosses in PvE).  The hit rating APEP you quoted there was based on a rogue already above hit cap on specials.  Going below hit cap on specials would be completely absurd in PvE, and quite bad in PvP as well.  I won't go into much more detail.. that should give you the general idea of whats going on though.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
On the earlier questions about dagger offhand sword spec stuff..  (assume 5/5 sword spec)<br>
Sword Spec works like this: Any time you attack with a sword, you have a 5% chance to get an extra main-hand attack.  It does not matter if your MH is a sword or not.  All that matters is the hand that swings.  If you have 2 swords, each time either of them swings, you have a 5% chance to get an extra MH swing.  If you have just an OH sword, each time it swings you have a chance to get an extra MH attack (with whatever non-sword you may be weilding).<br>
<br>
Combat potency favours fast offhands - the faster you swing, the more often you get energy back.  A rough estimate used is 0.1 speed = 10 DPS on the OH.  This isn't always exactly correct, as a faster OH generates more energy which is turned into DPS by your MH.. so a fast OH will increase your overall DPS based on how good you MH is.<br>
<br>
Both Combat potency and sword spec are % chance to proc effects, they are NOT ppm effects.  This means that the faster you OH is (assuming sword w/ sword spec), the more extra MH attacks you'll get and the more energy you'll get.<br>
<br>
If you have sword spec, it is MORE IMPORTANT TO HAVE AN OH SWORD than it is to have a MH sword.  If you have combat potency, a faster weapon is crucial.. the speed is worth a lot more than the stats or dps on the weapon.  That said, using a 1.3 spd Searing Sunblade over a 1.4 spd Messenger of Fate would be bad.  Using a non-sword OH with sword spec is just dumb.. switch weapons or specs.</div>

</div>There's virtually nothing wrong with Opportunity as a sword rogue. Garrote is not dagger reliant, so it gives you a damaging opener, and Garrote increases the damage to that end.<br>
PvE-wise, this means you actually have an opener in raids, and a low-aggro one at that, which is better then increased stealth since mobs shouldn't ever see you anyway.<br>
PvP-wise, Garrote is the only opener you'll ever want to use against mages if you're not dagger specced, 2 seconds of Silence &gt; 1 seconds of stun before the blink. And again, you get increased damage, which is even more important in PvP then it is in PvE.</div>

</div>I would argue that virtually every talent in the standard 20/41/0 Combat Sword spec is better than Opportunity in terms of PvE.  Your garrote is what.. 1500-1700 dmg?  20% more is an extra ~300 dmg.  5 minute fight.. thats 1 dps.  Yes, ONE dps.  Sure its more dps than say.. MoD gives you, but what exactly are you putting points into Sub tree for anyways with a non-dagger combat spec?<br>
<br>
For raiding.. garrote or ss both work fine as openers, small advantages either way.  In pvp, yes garrote is great for mages.  Can't blind away before you get AT LEAST a shiv and a spam-ability off.  Will an extra 300 dmg over 18 seconds win you a game?  Not likely.  Will MoD win you a game.. quite possibly.<br>

</div>Please read the first post instead of coming into a thread with a question where the answer has already been *clearly* posted.<br>
<br>
@ Aldriana: I tend to think it depends on exactly what you're fighting here. A lot of bosses you'll need to give your tank a little time for aggro, in the meanwhile you can safely run up to the boss in stealth and open with Garrote. Of course it's all dependent on your DPS vs your tank's TPS: all tanks are not created equal and therefore there may be more/less time before you can start attacking. <br>
<br>
On the whole however I tend to think Opportunity is the slimmest of DPS gains (as someone posted above, *1* DPS if you're fighting bosses that only last 5 minutes and it's actually viable to Garrote); unless you're a die-hard min-max'er I'd say it's pretty easy to skip this in favor of MoD. My final thought is that as of 2.3.2 (with Hemo nerfed) it looks like Combat Swords will become the top raiding spec again, and there would be no reason to put talents into Sub.</div>

		<div id="post_message_578100">In general I agree; I've certainly played with tanks who needed some ramp-up time to hold aggro.  However, in those cases, optimizing damage is to some extent irrelevant; you can only do as much damage as the tank has aggro, no matter how highly optimized (or not) your build.  And even in this situation, it's better to attack early with less damaging moves than it is to wait 15 seconds and then start nuking all-out, because the sooner you generate any aggro at all on the boss, the sooner you can start feinting - and feint, in an aggro-limited situation, is pure damage added.  Thus, when dealing with an aggro limited tank, I generally open very early and just autoattack/feint for a little while before cutting loose with full DPS cycles.<br>
<br>
And, of course, with a good tank and a well-coordinated guild, aggro shouldn't be an issue at all. If the tank gets a misdirect or two and starts bombing good aggro rotations, one can open full strength almost immediately without danger. I die more often to getting careless about vanishing and overaggroing 3 minutes into the fight than I do from pulling at the beginning.</div>

But i don't want to start a discussion on feint... it has its uses, but well, today an auto-attack crit does more aggro than a feint removes and feint being a 10 second cooldown doesnt help that much about it, considering you can easily push a Mainhand to 1.7-1.4 and an Offhand to below 1.0.</div>

		<div id="post_message_578166">Don't get me wrong: Feint isn't a particularly good skill, and as a general rule you want to avoid using it whenever possible.  But, it isn't totally useless; if, for instance, in the first 30 sec of a fight, your tank only generates, say, 15000 aggro, you would normally be limited to doing 30000 damage in this time.  If, on the other hand, you slip in 3 feints, you can do an extra 3000 (or so; I forget the exact aggro reduction of feint) damage during that 30 seconds.  Is that a lot? No, not really.  Over a 10 min fight, it's only 5 DPS.  But it's something; I'd rather have that 3000 extra damage than not have it.  Clearly it's even better if your tank puts out 30k aggro in that time so you can just nuke all out, but not all of us are so blessed with a good tank, and, as such, it's worth knowing how best to manage the situation.</div>

</div>Hmm, I'll try harder next time? (I didn't try too hard, because after circling the first totem a few times trying to mutilate it, I gave up and switched to SS. So I just assumed that they didn't have a back.)<br>
<br>
In any case, without an easy visual cue to distinguish the totem's "back", you may waste too much time trying to get into position. If the totem involves a good bit of run time to get to it, the extra positioning may even cause energy to tick past 100 as well, in which case switching weapons and dropping SS is preferred anyway. To each his own, I guess, but I found it just too awkward to try to do (as evidenced by the fact that I was never successful and incorrectly concluded it wasn't possible).</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">To the best of my knowledge (and let me be VERY honest by saying that we are still VERY unsure about Executioner except in a broad "it's about as good as mongoose" sense), this is how I personally break it down.<br>
<br>
Ex/Mongoose = Mongoose/Ex = Mongoose/Mongoose &gt;&gt; Ex/Ex<br>
<br>
That is - Executioner and Mongoose are both strong, and both strong on the mainhand, so it's more personal preference at this time.  They're both (as far as we can tell) PPM procs, so mainhand will proc more, regardless of speed (due to instant attacks with the mainhand).<br>
<br>
Please note that Ex/Ex is fairly weak due to the funky mechanics it has with overwriting/renewing itself instead of stacking.  Unless this changes, my opinion is that Ex/Ex is very inferior to the other options.<br>
<br>
It's my personal guess that as you move into more Armor Penetration gear (ZA and T6) that Executioner on the MH will start to outperform Mongoose.  This is due to Armor Penetration improving all rogue stats, including itself, so as you get more ArmorPen, it's more powerful (up till you're putting a target's armor at 0).  This makes the final graph for T6 rogues look like:<br>
<br>
Ex/Mongoose &gt; Mongoose/Ex &gt; Mongoose/Mongoose &gt;&gt; Ex/Ex.   <br>
<br>
Again this is all "educated speculation" at this point, but (to my knowledge) it's the best we have.  If you have concrete information about Executioner other than "Wow I feel like it's up a lot!" please post in the Executioner thread on these boards.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</div>This is the same conclusion I came to, and I am still missing 2 pieces of armor penetration gear.  Currently I have the T6 Gloves, Stormrage Signet Ring, Warp-Spring Coil, Madness of the Betrayer and a Blade of Infamy with Executioner on it (I also have one with Mongoose... we got a bunch of them).  My plan is to use Executioner on low armor bosses and Mongoose on higher armor bosses.  I also still plan to pick up the T6 shoulders (second in line now) and the ZA Ring, which should give me another ~250 passive -armor.<br>
<br>
Basically if your guild doesn't use Faerie Fire, CoR and Sunder then Mongoose is always better.  If your guild fully debuffs the mob, then it depends on how much -armor you have from other gear.  If you can get above the threshold, then Executioner surpasses Mongoose, if you can't it doesn't.  My guess is we will see more -armor gear in Sunwell, which will make hitting that point significantly easier.</div>

		<div id="post_message_579045">Ok, so I just went on the PTR to figure out how the new addition to Sinister Calling works.  Using various low range weapons (1-3 Dirk and 1-3 Mace) at different attack power ratings and checking the synergy with Opportunity.<br>
<br>
The result is the following:<br>
[Weapon Damage] = [Base Weapon] + [Attack Power]/14*[Normalized Weapon Speed]<br>
[Normalized Weapon Speed] = 1.7 for Daggers; 2.4 for Swords, Maces, Fists<br>
New Hemo<br>
(1.1+0.02*[ranks of Sinister Calling])*[Weapon Damage]<br>
<br>
It truly does only add to the base damage multiplier...<br>
<br>
Now, the discovery...<br>
Backstab was not working according to expectations.  The damage was not matching up correctly to theorycraft...<br>
After playing with numbers on a spreadsheet trying to figure out what was getting multiplied where and hitting Level 1 mobs (with Serrated Blades making the Armor 0), I couldn't make it add up correctly.<br>
Until, I considered...what if, the +255 already includes a multiplier...<br>
The new correct formula for backstab:<br>
(1.5+0.02*[ranks of Sinister Calling])*[Weapon Damage + 170]*(1+ 0.02*[ranks of Aggression]+[Surprise Attacks]+0.04*[ranks of Opportunity])<br>
<br>
And, by the way, new Shadowstep does not award a Combo point.<br>
<br>
I'll have a new version of the DPS Spreadsheet ready shortly.  <br>
<br>
Thought I'd share my discoveries first so Aldriana will have the correct formulas as well.</div>

		<div id="post_message_579048">Ah, okay.  So if I'm reading you right, Backstab with 5/5 Sinister Calling would have a base damage of 160% + 272, rather than the 160% + 255 one might normally expect?  Good to know, and easy enough to change. I still don't think it's going to make a particularly large difference to overall viability of deep-sub dagger builds for raiding, though; you just have to give up too much important stuff for what you get in exchange.</div>

<br>
True enough.  Daggers have enough problems and going deep Subtlety instead of deep combat doesn't help.  But, the important thing is that Hemo damage is 120% with Full sinister calling instead of 121% as it would be if it were multiplicative.  Although a minor difference, its at least relevant to specs people might consider.  And, of course, that the Shadowstep Combo point is no more, replaced by movement speed.</div>

Here is a better way to ask my question...... (this is assuming your specced for combat sword + mace the way Valujin suggested)<br>

Pretend that you have a mace and a sword each having 2.9 speed and 200-300 dmg.<br>

Also you have a mace and a sword each having 1.5 speed and 100-180 dmg.<br>

<br>
I'm looking for detailed information and testing on raiding mutilate in Hyjal/BT. Any and all feedback to the following would greatly be appreciated.<br>
<br>
<br>
<u>Encounters</u>: <br>
I can already see that speccing any form of daggers will hurt my damage for several encounters, more specifically Hyjal trash, Gurtogg, and Kael'thas (thankfully we only kill him rarely for keying recruits). <br>
<br>
<u>Ideal Group composition</u>: Currently I would have my choice of two groups. <br>
Physical DPS group 1 normally consists of 2-3 dps warriors, enhancement shaman, 1-2 rogues.<br>
Physical DPS group 2 normally consists of 2 hunters, feral druid, resto shaman (dropping GoA), and a paladin.<br>
<br>
If we need to roll dps heavy and there are 3 rogues and 3 dps warriors in raid, we tend to stick a rogue in the second group. <br>
<br>
<br>
<u>Personal stats and gearing</u>:<br>
My Armory: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302213017/http://www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Stonemaul&amp;n=Totalbodygym" target="_blank">http://www.wowarmory.com/character-s...n=Totalbodygym</a><br>
(for weapons I currently have s2 mh and oh daggers)<br>
I am currently working on my crit rating which I believe needs to be closer to 30% unbuffed. I am also about 1-2 months away from Ashtongue Deathsworn exalted, and I wouldn't spec for mutilate until then. <br>
<br>
Once at ~30% crit rating, I believe that being in group 2 with GoA and a Feral druid, along with the exalted BT trinket, I could push a sustained Crit rating of ~40-45%. <br>
<br>
<u>Spec and DPS cycles</u>:<br>
I believe the spec should be based solely on your DPS cycle (which is based on your crit rating), however certain talents should never be changed. <br>
<br>
Considering the possibility of sustaining 40-45% crit rating, combo point generation would not be an issue. Keeping Find Weakness up long enough to issue 4/5 CP finishers to keep trinket proc up is crucial (all the while keeping SnD and rupture up as well).<br>
<br>
It is my understanding that keeping a stack of DP refreshed while using SnD/rupture/eviscerate (when SnD timer allows) outweighs the burst of using envenom instead of evisc. Does this still hold true? Would I be eviscerating enough to make imp eviscerate viable?<br>
<br>
If imp Eviscerate is viable: <br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302213017/http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=fheboxgoizVoMIV0bV" target="_blank">Talent Calculator - World of Warcraft</a><br>
I believe the combat tree would be final there. I would need imp SS for Kael and I would probably weaponswitch SS on gurtogg if I received the enrage.<br>
<br>
If envenom is viable, I would drop imp evisc and spec into Vile poisons.</div>

Have any other Mace-users experienced very low crit-% in PVE bosses using Sinister strike? Links are to two WWS from Hyjal, combat spec (20/41/0) with unbuffed crit-% roughly 27%, Kael rod + BT trash mace.<br>

That is really strange... can't help but think it is a bugged implementation of the new Mace Spec (opps... we added 3% damage on crits, but accidentally lowered your Crit Rate by 3% for each Mace used...).<br>
<br>
Also, edit your post to follow forums rules before you get an infraction/banned.  (No Greeting and don't sign it)<br>
<br>
Edit - Both of the other rogues are going to have significantly higher Crit rates then you because both of them are using the BT Rep Trinket. which is 7% or so to Crit, and when used correctly you can have it apply to the majority of your Sinister Strikes (making your SS Crit rate disproportionately higher) aka you wait until you have full energy to do a finisher, then chain off as many SS's as you can under the buff, then wait till you have full energy again, and repeat.  However, your crit rate for melee should be similar to your crit rate for SS which it isn't, but the trinket explains the difference between you and the other rogues.</div>

</div>It's not the mace spec in general, the data shows, that melee-crit-% is roughly normal, it's the Sinister Strike crit-% that is off. In same fights at the same time, melee-% 30%, ss-crit-% 20%. <br>

can't help of not thinking, that mace spec with malice is not +5% crit, but -5% crit in specials...<br>

</div>The total amount of sinsiter strike swings in those 3 parses combined is under 300. That's a pretty low number. If you have 25% crit percentage, don't expect the random number generator to give you exactly 1 crit every 4 swings. The statistics for the white hits are probably closer to where they should be, because the number of swings is much larger.<br>
<br>
I don't see anything wrong there. You probably just had an unlucky streak.</div>

-Remember that haste is just another stat. You can safely itemize for haste by using the equivalency table in the first post. Stacking inordinate amounts of haste at the expense of other stats (that cloak is junk) is just giving up damage for a gimmick.<br>

				<strong>Why is +hit &gt; +haste?</strong>
			</div>
			<hr size="1" style="color:#FFFFFF">
			<!-- / icon and title -->
		
		
		<!-- message -->
		<div id="post_message_581614">We've all looked at the spreadsheet, run the calcs, run the AEP macro, etc, and it all tells us that (no matter what the spec), hit rating is superior to haste rating.<br>
<br>
My question is, why?<br>
<br>
In theory, +hit and +haste do exactly the same thing: increase your white hits. 15.76 hit rating increases your chance to hit by per swing by 1%, and 15.76 increases your number of swings by 1%. Don't those theoretically amount to the same thing? If so, then why is hit rating on top?<br>
<br>
Let me take this a little bit further... haste is a true 1% white DPS increase, because it increases the number of swings. This means it increases the number of hits, crits, glancings, dodges, and misses all together by 1%. Hit, on the other hand, just converts misses to hits. Thus, it's actual contribution depends on what your hit table looks like. Let's take my stats for +hit (pulling numbers right off the spreadsheet)...<br>
<br>
6.50% dodge<br>
5.67% miss<br>
30.96% crit<br>
25.00% glancing (is a % reduction even included for this anymore?)<br>
31.87% hit<br>
<br>
For arguments sake (because I can't find the real number), glancings do 85% damage. My DPS weighting therefore looks like...<br>
<br>
(30.96*2 + 25.00*0.85 + 31.87*1) -&gt; thus I do 115.04% of my avg. white damage as DPS<br>
<br>
And the percent increase from 1% hit is...<br>
<br>
((30.96*2 + 25.00*0.85 + 32.87*1) - (30.96*2 + 25.00*0.85 + 31.87*1))/(30.96*2 + 25.00*0.85 + 31.87*1)<br>
<br>
(116.04 - 115.04) / 115.04 = 0.00869 -&gt; an 0.869% DPS increase (?)<br>
<br>
So why does hit come out better than haste?<br>
<br>
The only thing I can think of is that in terms of numbers of attacks that connect, +hit is slightly more valuable. +1% haste increases number of connecting white hits by exactly 1%; +1% hit's contributing again depends on your table. For me,<br>
<br>
((30.96 + 25.00 + 32.87) - (30.96 + 25.00 + 31.87))/(30.96 + 25.00 + 31.87)<br>
<br>
(88.83 - 87.83) / 88.83 = 0.01125 -&gt; a 1.13% increase in number of connecting attacks.<br>
<br>
Specced into combat potency and sword spec, I can see where that would be more useful. But even if I drop poisons from my offhand weapon and use a deadliness Hemo trispec it comes out the same. What gives?<br>
<br>
EDIT: I figured it out; it's windfury! If I am not running with WF totem, then when I run the AEP macro I get haste &gt; hit for buffed DPS (0.75 &gt; 0.72). If I am running with WF, then I get hit &gt;&gt; haste (0.91 &gt;&gt; 0.72). It seems like that slight 0.13% difference in number of white hits shouldn't change the rating <i>that</i> much, but apparently it does. Amazing how one totem makes that much of a difference in our itemization. Any thoughts?<br>
<br>
For clarification, I am using an 11/20/30 spec in the test, so as not to have Sword Spec or Combat Potency. I also do not have a DST.</div>

		<div id="post_message_581682">Let's say you do 100 attacks. Assuming 28% Miss, 6% dodge (the latter is approximated for a boss mob to make this easier).<br>
<br>
Your average Joe rogue with 0 Hit and 0 Haste will have a hit table that looks like this: 25 Glance, 28 Miss, 6 Dodge, 41 Hits. Let's leave crit out of it for the time being.<br>
<br>
If you add 1% Haste, you now have done 101 attacks, and your attack table looks like this: 25.25 Glance, 28.28 Miss, 6.06 Dodge, 41.41 Hits. Note you only actually gained 0.41 white attacks, and all the procs that come with it including chance to crit on that attack.<br>
<br>
If you add 1% Hit, that's essentially converting one of your misses to hits, so your attack table should be. 100 Attacks: 25 Glance, 27 Miss, 6 Dodge, 42 Hits. You gained a whole one white attack and this can proc your procs, as well as *I think* crit.<br>
<br>
Obviously, the more procs you have, the more valuable doing more white attacks will be, this is why the value of hit improves more than haste the more procs you have, i.e. Combat Potency and OH Poison.</div>

If you add 1% Hit, that's essentially converting one of your misses to hits, so your attack table should be. 100 Attacks: 25 Glance, 27 Miss, 6 Dodge, 42 Hits. You gained a whole one white attack and this can proc your procs, as well as *I think* crit.<br>
<br>
Obviously, the more procs you have, the more valuable doing more white attacks will be, this is why the value of hit improves more than haste the more procs you have, i.e. Combat Potency and OH Poison.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</div>First off, by the single roll table for white hits, a hit you gain from +hit will never crit. It will simply go from a miss to a hit. Hits you can from +haste, however, will, because you are getting more swings in overall (thus more of everything, including crits).<br>
<br>
Second, did you read through all of what I was saying? I specifically turned off poisons and used an 11/20/30 spec so that Sword Spec and Combat Potency would not factor in.<br>
<br>
And what was surprising me was that, <i>with only Windfury totem and no other synergystic trinkets/talents,</i> +hit was still showing up as much, <i>much</i>, better than +haste. I thought that was odd. It looks like the increased damaging hits per second from +hit outweights the actual DPS increase from +haste by proccing WF more. Odd that it is so <i>much</i> better though.</div>

I've just picked up my 3rd piece of tier 5 and I think I'm in line on dkp to get the the pants next week. I really have no idea how this extra energy is going to work or how it will effect my combo point cycle (currently using 4s/5r). Also, if it procs when i'm about to do a 5pt rupture, is it worth it to use an eviscerate instead?

</div>You just continue your cycles and they just get faster.  DPE is still relevant, and Rupture will do more damage on average every time.  Basically it is like free energy, sure you can get 10 more free energy by using Eviserate, but keep in mind that 3100 Eviserate is only a 1330 non crit, and for example my average rupture does 2450 damage, so unless you have a 60% or higher crit rate, you are still better off using rupture if it can tick out.  Essentially the 4 piece T5 bonus just speeds up your cycle, but it shouldn't materially change it.</div>

My question is would a build with dual weapon spec give you more dps than a combat swords spec? All i would miss out on is vial poisons. Here is the build.<br>

This is for end game theory. If you get all your t6 the only expertise item you should be wearing idealy is belt of one hundred deaths. So wouldnt stacking 10 expertise plus sword spec plus 5 percent bigger crits and 10 more expertise from talents outweigh 16 percent damge from poisons? Has this been tested? Would losing sword spec procs on the offhand hurt the dps?</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">We've all looked at the spreadsheet, run the calcs, run the AEP macro, etc, and it all tells us that (no matter what the spec), hit rating is superior to haste rating.<br>
<br>
&lt;snip&gt;<br>
<br>
EDIT: I figured it out; it's windfury! If I am not running with WF totem, then when I run the AEP macro I get haste &gt; hit for buffed DPS (0.75 &gt; 0.72). If I am running with WF, then I get hit &gt;&gt; haste (0.91 &gt;&gt; 0.72). It seems like that slight 0.13% difference in number of white hits shouldn't change the rating <i>that</i> much, but apparently it does. Amazing how one totem makes that much of a difference in our itemization. Any thoughts?<br>
<br>
For clarification, I am using an 11/20/30 spec in the test, so as not to have Sword Spec or Combat Potency. I also do not have a DST.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</div>Seems to me that at least part of the answer might be some sort of bug in the Rogue DPS sheet.  If I put your gear into the Rogue Gear sheet with a 11/20/30 spec and pull the EAP numbers, I get:<br>
<br>
With WF: Haste 1.73, Hit 1.80<br>
Without WF: Haste 1.63, Hit 1.50<br>
<br>
or, in AEP, if you prefer: <br>
<br>
With WF: Haste .87, Hit .91<br>
Without WF: Haste .83, Hit .77<br>
<br>
Which is a swing from about 5% better to about 10% worse, which is a significantly smaller swing that you observed in the DPS sheet.  And, while I confess I might be biased on this matter, I'm more inclined to trust the Gear sheet than the DPS sheet.<br>
<br>
Fundamentally, the reason hit tends to do well is procs; WF and Mongoose in your case, those plus Sword Spec, Combat Potency, poisons, Dragonspine Trophy, etc. for rogues in general.  In particular, PPM effects (Mongoose/Executioner, Dragonspine Trophy, Madness of the Betrayer, etc.) scale with hit but not with haste, which gives hit a relative advantage.  On some of the others (Sword Spec and WF), Hit has twice the effect of Haste; both effect the number of procs that actually occur, but hit additionally applies to how many of those additional procs do damage; the number of extra hits from WF scales as hit^2 while only linearly with haste.  And those WF procs may in their own right proc additional stuff, strengthening *that* effect even further.<br>
<br>
So, long story short: the exact magnitude of the numbers you're seeing is probably a bug; but the idea that hit gets better relative to haste as you accumulate more procs (such as WF) is fundamentally correct.</div>

</div>I'm 11/27/23--Hemo, no CP.<br>
<br>
Basically, if I SnD down to near 0 energy and get neither Ruthlessness nor Relentless (32% of the time), I need 175 energy for 5 Hemos.  This usually means 9 ticks, which is already longer than the SnD.  So I'm basically wondering if the recommendation for 1s/5r with Hemo assumes SnD downtime.<br>
<br>
Actually, looking again, 1s/5r, 2s/5r, and 3s/5r are all very close in the spreadsheet, and the "winner" changes based on gear/buffs.  So I should probably stop worrying about which is slightly better and just use 2s.<br>
<br>
------------<br>
<br>
This brings up a question--does the spreadsheet overvalue cycles like 1s/5r (with either Hemo or Combat) that risk SnD downtime?  In reality, there's fluctuation in your CP/energy generation that's all averaged out for the spreadsheet.  However, the fluctuations can only hurt your DPS by causing an SnD drop; they can't improve it somehow (a lucky string or Ruthlessness procs doesn't improve your DPS, it just results in a bit of wasted SnD time).  So a spreadsheet would overestimate the DPS of a really tight cycle by assuming full SnD uptime.</div>

</div>Ah, missed that, sorry. In that case:<br>
<br>
1s5r is not sustainable with tri-spec hemo, even with 2/5 T4.  A 1-pt SnD lasts 17.4 seconds and thus you regenerate 174 energy while it's up.  To do a 1s5r cycle you need to generate 4.8 combo points during this time, plus 20 extra energy for finishers; 4.8 Hemos costs 168 energy, so the total energy cost of the cycle is 188, which is more than the 174 you regenerate.  Even 2s5r isn't quite sustainable; it takes 218 energy to perform 5.8 Hemos and cast the two finishers, and there's only time for 217.5 energy to regenerate.  So in practice, even with 2/5 T4, the tightest cycle maintainable with tri-spec Hemo is 3s5r.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I have a question about human rogues. I know for orcs you cant get the double expertise from axes and stack it to 10. But with a rogue i noticed putting on a sword and putting on a mace it stacks expertise to 10. <br>

My question is would a build with dual weapon spec give you more dps than a combat swords spec? All i would miss out on is vial poisons. Here is the build.<br>

<br>
This is for end game theory. If you get all your t6 the only expertise item you should be wearing idealy is belt of one hundred deaths. So wouldnt stacking 10 expertise plus sword spec plus 5 percent bigger crits and 10 more expertise from talents outweigh 16 percent damge from poisons? Has this been tested? Would losing sword spec procs on the offhand hurt the dps?</div>

</div>Hmm...I might need to look at that, as somehow the spreadsheet recommended that cycle.  Clearly I must be maintaining it suffering a slow energy bleed and refreshing energy on movement.  Most fights seem to require one to either reposition or dodge AOEs, so that might account for it.  Having been a dagger rogue running 1s/3r, I'm pretty used to adjusting cycles on the fly, looking at the timing and cutting to a 4-pt Rupture when necessary to maintain 100% SnD uptime even with Hemo with 2pc-T4.<br>
<br>
Granted, I can't think of very many fights where I'm allowed to just stand there for any extended period of time, so that must be how it's been working for me.  At a certain point you just play.  You pick how many points you are dropping for SnD and adjust accordingly by dropping Rupture with as many points as you have in order to not drop SnD.  Maybe the problem is the current lack of modeling for 1s/3r and 1s/4r cycles.  Something I want to add to the DPS sheet at some point.</div>

</div>--heavy edit--<br>
<br>
I'd say that the reason 1s/3r and 1s/4r don't perform as well as might initially be thought is because of the AP scaling of Rupture based on the number of combo points you're using.  As Aldriana says in the post below you only gain 4/10/18/21/24% of AP at 1/2/3/4/5 combo points.<br>
<br>
I do have a question though - do they actally peform better than xs/5r cycles?  If so then why aren't we simply suggesting that they be used instead?  Shaker's post seems to say "1s/xr cycles do perform better than xs/5r cycles but not by a lot so we'll suggest using the lower dps cycles for some reason".  I would have thought that if a shorter cycle is just as stable and does more damage, even if it's only 1 dps, then it must be better to use it, particularly on fights where you may not have 100% time on your target (Gruul, Hydross, Leo, Vashj, Solarian...)<br>
<br>
With regard to 1s/5r Hemo cycles, my personal experience (and I apologise that it's nothing more than that but it may help to explain things) is that they become sustainable for quite a while after a few lucky Ruthlessness procs.  You tend then to be sitting at slightly higher base energy levels so when you don't get the proc there is a reserve for you to dip into and sustain the cycle.  Of course, the moment you get a bad streak of Ruthlessness not proccing then your cycle falls apart again.<br>
<br>
2s/5r, 3s/5r or the 1s/xr cycles are far more stable for Hemo trispec builds.</div>

		<div id="post_message_582538">Yes, I completely agree and that was also my point.  One way to absorb it is by running a tighter cycle.  If you are running a cycle that bleeds 14 energy every 17.4 secs, you bleed a little over 48 energy a minute.  If combat factors take you out of action for a 5 sec period once a minute, you have essentially recouped that energy.  This is of course assuming you pop your rupture right before the disruption.<br>
<br>
Anyway, we are somewhat off-topic.  Although this discussion has given me a thought.  It probably wouldn't be too hard to model such disruptions.  Check boxes could be added that quantified the disruption in seconds per minute.  You'd add 10 energy every second of the disruption and multiply total dps by 1-[disruption]/60 and have a reasonable DPS estimate of any fight with fixed disruptions.  The sheet itself would really auto-calculate your new preferred cycle.  It's an interesting concept.  Now, I'll probably hold off on this for a bit.  It would need a separate page marked "Advanced" and maybe instructions on how to model it.  <br>
<br>
But let's take Gruul for example.  Ground Slams are predictable (happen in X amount of time).  One could go into one's own combat logs, look for their last auto-attack prior to the slam, find the time to the next attack after.  Take a number of samples, derive an average downtime.  Check the combat log for the frequency of the Ground Slam.  (Downtime)/(Ground Slam frequency) = disruption.  Although this might be a bad example given that the Ground Slam/Shatter might have a duration greater than one can absorb.  The same concept could be applied to fights where one runs from AOEs.  Check the combat log, out of combat 3 secs every 30 seconds, enter 6 secs in the disruption box and enable it, presto, fairly accurate broken fight modeling.</div>

		<div id="post_message_582556">I actually thought about doing such a thing, but such a model requires a little sophistication beyond what's stated.<br>
<br>
First, instead of tracking a straight disruption fraction, you need to explicitly track "n seconds of interruption every m seconds", as you don't actually start losing yellow damage the instant you are disrupted, while you do start losing white damage.  For instance, if you experience a 2 second interruption every 10 seconds, you never lose any yellow damage; but if you experience a 10 second interruption every 50 seconds, your energy caps out at you do lose some yellow damage.  Hence, while same have the same loss of white damage, the second will additionally lose yellow damage.<br>
<br>
Second, you need to think about how this effects abilities with cooldowns, hidden or otherwise; As long as the interruption is (mostly) predictable and doesn't occur more than once every 20 seconds, you don't lose any Blade Flurry or Adrenaline Rush damage from it.  Procs with internal cooldowns are a little trickier (since they do cool during interruptions, but you also risk losing uptime to the disruption).  So you need to think a little bit about modeling that.<br>
<br>
Additionally, since your ratio of white to yellow damage is changing, your cycle may change as well; hence, this needs to be factored in as well.  It's actually this last point that's prevented me from adding such a feature to the Rogue Gear sheet; cycle computation becomes an absolute mess.  If I ever get around to the programming-language implementation of this, I might put such a thing in; but in a spreadsheet I found it too messy to model with any accuracy.</div>

		<div id="post_message_582607">I still think that there is an inherent problem with attempting to model distruptions.  DMM mentioned it - "This is of course assuming you pop your rupture right before the disruption.".  An assumption I for one do not think is valid.<br>
<br>
You can't time your cycles to running out on Rage.  You can't time your cycles to Morogrims WG's.  You can't time a cycle to Mag's "shake-you-around".  Your cycle is a certain length.. altering it to attempt to match a distruption on a fight-by-fight basis.. meh.  In reality you just have to dps away, keep energy low (grr.. clashes with my mental 'burst with BT exalted trinket' thoughts) and be happy that at least you're regen'ing energy while away from the boss, unlike your warrior friends.  Lets not forget - you are still AWAY FROM THE BOSS.  Time on target is huge.  With ~65% of your damage from auto attacks.. you still lose.<br>
<br>
I suppose the only real scenerio you could do this for is perhaps Prince and Najentus.  Prince you generally get spurts of ~17 seconds dps - perfect for a 1s/5r.  Alternatively, I find 4-5s/5r works nicely (run in w/ 4+ points.. SnD as I run in and build to 5, rupture and get hopefully another 4+).  Najentus.. you can just time finishers a bit and play with your cycle (if theres 17 seconds left before bubble and you have 2 cp.. SnD, don't go for another SS before you do a standard 3-point SnD.  Add in the 2-3 seconds to get that SS and SnD off and you have just done a 21-second SnD with 15 seconds left before bubble.. when you could of dropped a 17-second SnD with 17 seconds left.  Then you can argue over how the next "phase" starts... <br>
<br>
Really, its just a matter of being a smart person and adapting to the scenerio.  Like Ald said.. 93% of your dps from just being on target and doing 5s.</div>

		<div id="post_message_582800">Okay, so it's slightly more complicated than that, but it might be a nice future feature.  It's not very high at all on my list (and thus may never happen), but I still think it would give a decent approximation for some fights.  Like you said, you adjust to the circumstances.  Given that most cycles give pretty similar DPS anyway, if one assumes that a good rogue is going to make smart choices with their adjustments (and thus achieve similar cycle DPS to their main cycle up to and immediately following a disruption), it still might work.<br>
<br>
Of course the other way of dealing with it could just be a checkbox that's % DPS expected.  If solid rogues are only realizing 80% of theoretical DPS because of the disruptions of a given fight, you could enter 80% and get an approximation without pulling out a calculator and dividing it yourself.  I guess that could be the low-tech uncomplicated method of modeling it.</div>

Being a mace rogue, I naturally bid and won, but was still unsure of how much of an upgrade this was from my current Dragonstrike. After doing testing on Archimonde, I've found that I usually do better with the Dragonstrike, but as my hit rating went up, my DPS went down, which brings me to my next point. I was doing some thinking, and wondering if there was a point of inflection in crit's favor over hit for Mace spec. So in general, which do you guys think would do me better for a weapon, and if you know, what would happen to be the more specific combat mechanics, like the roll system, and if there is, at which point crit becomes better than hit for a Mace rogue?</div>

What do you mean by this? If you're adding straight hit rating and keeping everything else constant, there's absolutely no way your DPS is going down. So by that I have to assume you are sacrificing some other stats to get hit. In order to evaluate what's happening and address your theory about a point of inflection (which gut instinct I would say won't happen until the hit cap), you have to mention what kind of stats you're losing for every point of hit that's causing your dps to go down. For instance, if you're giving up 100 AP to get 5 hit, yeah your dps is going to go down, because that's a terrible trade.</div>

</div>You're not going to be able to draw any <i>real</i> conclusions with such a small sample size as Archimonde, or even to be able to conclusively say anything based, for example, on two entire weeks of raiding assuming it's relatively close.<br>
<br>
We have some great resources here and I really wish more people would use them. If you had read the first post you would've been able to use the APEP values to approximate how much DPS you're getting/losing with the different stats, and it of course takes into account Mace Spec. <br>
<br>
Furthermore, we have two great spreadsheets which you can plug your gear into and see what's an upgrade and what's not.<br>
<br>
Finally my gut feeling is the Dragonstrike is going to be better than the Syphon. Of course you'd have to use the spreadsheet to figure that out.</div>

</div>Re: "How the server calculates stuff" - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302204045/http://www.wowwiki.com/Attack_table#Auto_Attack_Table" target="_blank">Attack table - WoWWiki - Your guide to the World of Warcraft</a><br>
<br>
Re: "Archimonde fight shows this is better!" - Between Airburst and Fear.. this is probably one of the worst fights to judge damage on.  At least Akama is always the same length of time you spend attacking him (within a few sec).<br>
<br>
Between your two sets of gear, net difference is:<br>
+18 AP<br>
-28 Hit<br>
+2.03% crit (~45 crit rating)<br>
<br>
So um.. yea, 45 crit rating and 18 AP is definately better than 28 hit.  Hell, the 2% crit &gt; 2% hit regardless of the AP (and you get slightly more than 2% crit, slightly less than 2% hit).<br>
<br>
Either way - if you're on Archimonde.. you'll likely be upgrading your T4-2pc and Hourglass/Brooch soon.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
In a more general sense, the difference between hit and crit is a bit.. strange for rogues.  Crit has the noted advantage of applying to both autoattacks and specials.  For specials it generally means 2.3x as much dmg (Lethality).. possiblt an extra 3% more for RED meta.  However, more crits mean less hits, as described in the Attack Table linked above.  This means no extra landed attacks.  Hit on the other hand converts a miss to a hit.  This means a smaller "per-attack" dmg increase (going from 0 to 100 dmg for a hit, 100 to 203 for a crit autoattack, 100 to 236 for a special), but you have more landed attacks.  This means more chances to proc: Mongoose, Combat Potency, Sword Spec, Windfury (proc'ing an extra attack), Windfury attack (the actual extra attack, which can miss), Dragonspine, etc.  Now.. as a mace rogue, you don't have sword spec.. but the rest should still apply.<br>
<br>
In terms of "point of inflection".. its actually the reverse of what you may think.  Hit scales with it self in a positive way.  The more hit you have, the better it is to get more hit.  This is largely due to WF.  The more hit you have, the more likely you will proc WF attacks.. and thus want even more hit.<br>
<br>
Lets look at a standard attack table for roughly your gear: (played with the numbers a bit to make things easier)<br>
5% miss<br>
3.25% dodge<br>
25% glance<br>
26.75% crit<br>
40% hit<br>
This works out to: (for maces)<br>
(5 * 0) + (3.25 * 0) + (25 * 0.75) + (26.75 * 2.05) + (40 * 1) = 113.6<br>
Adding 1% hit or 1% crit both increase your total dmg nearly the same.. slightly more for crit due to the modifiers but nothing significant.  Adding 1% crit turns a hit into a crit.. so you turn a 1.00 into a 2.05.  Adding 1% hit turns a 0 into a 1.00.<br>
<br>
Say you had some really crit-heavy gear.. (note.. this is not *too* far off from my gear)<br>
5% miss<br>
4% dodge<br>
25% glance<br>
50% crit<br>
16% hit<br>
<br>
(5 * 0) + (4 * 0) + (25 * 0.75) + (50 * 2.05) + (16 * 1) = 137.25<br>
Adding 1% crit moves you to 138.3.  This is a 0.76% increase in damage.  Adding hit will increase your damage similarily.  The added bonus of hit, is that you gain more procs too.<br>
<br>
<br>
When talking about sword spec and WF..<br>
Say you had:<br>
15% miss<br>
6% dodge<br>
25% glance<br>
40% crit<br>
14% hit<br>
You only are landing 79% of your attacks.  This means 79% of your attacks have a chance to proc WF/SS.. which in turn has only a 79% chance of landing itself.  This results in a 0.79 ^ 2 chance (times the 5 or 20% for WF/SS to proc).. roughly a 62% chance of landing a WF or SS attack.<br>
<br>
If you increase your hit and expertise a bit:<br>
2% miss<br>
3% dodge<br>
25% glance<br>
70% crit + hit<br>
You end up with 95% of your attacks landing (16% higher than the above example).  This turns into 0.95 ^ 2 landed WF/SS attacks.. or a 90% chance to land WF/SS.  Thats 28% better than before, with an increase of only 16% chance to land the attack.<br>
<br>
Hit scales very nicely with WF/SS.. just always adds the same damage increase point after point.  Going from 1% to 2% crit nets you the same raw damage increase as going from 50 to 51%.  This is a similar effect to AP, which does not scale with itself at all.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
All this math an theorycraft aside - you can pretty much just trust the spreadsheet :P.  In your gear tradeoff.. you got a lot more crit for a small hit loss.  Use the APEP numbers provided to figure out what is an "acceptable" tradeoff in terms of hit vs crit.  In general, 1 crit RATING &lt; 1 hit RATING.  However, 1% hit &lt; 1% crit.  You tried to compare less than 2% hit to more than 2% crit.. and added in some AP to the crit side.</div>

</div>I think you were just unlucky; the nature of probability is that some people (such as myself) get Dragonspine on their first Gruul kill, while some people (such as you) don't see one for months at a time.

Using the EP values from post 1 for swords (which will bias hit to be even better than it is for you), we can see that you traded 95 EP in AP and Crit  for 61.88 in hit.<br>

Hit is a good stat, and better point for point than anything else -  but other stats are still worth something too, and trading away too much crit or AP or DPS or Stam (Glass cannons die. Dying sucks.) for hit is a bad deal.</div>

(If I remember correctly it assumed 3000ap as well, but only 30 or 35% crit.)</div>

</div>I'm at a similar level of gear at the moment. Even with a heap of crit and armor ignored, rupture is still a fair bit better. Without mangle my calculations have eviscerate and rupture doing almost the same amount of damage, 1850. But the extra 10 energy from rupture is worth around 600 damage.</div>

With the 15% nerf and the 10% increased Hemo damage in Sinister Calling, that leaves a 5% nerf in Hemo damage (if one decides to spec that deep into Subtlety).<br>
<br>
Does Hemo at 120% damage still scale better then Sinister Strike?  With the increased debuff taken into account, is this really that big of a nerf for Hemo if one were to spec Shadowstep Non-Dagger?<br>

		<div id="post_message_584987">Searching around the last few pages of the recently-locked Hemo thread would give you the answer to this question, which is, roughly speaking:<br>
<br>
Speccing that deep into subtlety costs you a lot of really good combat and/or assassination talents, and pretty clearly results in a build that does a fair amount less damage than traditional combat. It does have a few utility and survival talents that are potentially helpful in raids, but most people (myself included) feel that they're not worth losing so much DPS to get.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, Tri-Spec Hemo is still a reasonably solid build for raiding; if most Hemo charges are used, it will do comparable or slightly superior damage to combat.  Typically, it's a little stronger than combat at T4 levels of itemization, but falls behind as you move into T6.  For exact details, I would recommend consulting a spreadsheet to see which works better for you.</div>

		<!-- message -->
		<div id="post_message_585189">Just a heads up for anyone out there who has some technical skills and ambition.. I'm currently in the process of writing a DPS Simulator.  This started as an "I'm bored" project and I've been putting more and more time into it as the work is quite enjoyable.<br>
<br>
Key information:<br>
-Written in Java.  Its one of the 3 programming languages I know best, its one of the most well-known languages, platform independant, etc.<br>
-Based on entering the Gear/Buffs you have, not your stats (something I feel is a flaw with DPS Sims for other classes).<br>
-Quite generic in that I could add functionality to say.. model Warrior DPS.. just by adding in their attacks and warrior-unique items.  All of the Gear/Buffs/etc would just be reused.<br>
-I'm writing it with the ability to log just as the WoW combat logger works.  You could upload your DPS Sim to WWS, cutting a lot of the "report" type functionality out of this app.<br>
-I'm currently working on the back end logic, I do no have any GUI at all.  Ideally I would be looking for someone to help write a GUI.  This would either be a web interface or treating this like a standalone application that can be downloaded and used.<br>
<br>
At this point I have a working framework which handles adding gear and talents to a player and handling "Events" which reside on a queue.  Essentially, I can auto-attack with most talents working.  The next main sections I'll be doing are adding all the proc-type stuff from various items (mostly trinkets) and a yellow-dps AI.<br>
<br>
If you have the skills and would be interested in helping, please PM me and we can go from there.  I'm mainly looking for GUI help, that is certainly my weaker area.<br>
<br>
If you are unable to help and just eager to use it - No ETA.</div>

</div>I'm pretty sure that if you are a Combat Sword/Fist or Combat Hemo spec, then 20 hit will be the better option. If you're CDaggers then 20 agility will edge it out slightly. <br>

</div>Because you're asking about an un-modelable (or, at least, unspecified) amount of running around, all you really have to work with is the individual DPS value of the talents you're asking about. If you want to get really detailed, you could easily figure out the amount of damage (on average) per swing that each of those talent choices would make, but I strongly doubt that 3/5 Improved Poisons in those runaround fights is going to get you more mileage than 3/5 Vile would overall for any type of fight. <br>
<br>
But, because you asked, I'll at least try...<br>
<br>
I'm not a math whiz by any means, but I'll take a shot at showing the damage added to a single swing on average (because you're asking about brief DPS time). <br>
<br>
Deadly Poison VII<br>
30% proc rate<br>
180 Damage over 12 up to 5 stacks<br>
<br>
With no talents, DP would add about <br>
180 * .3 = 54 damage per swing<br>
<br>
3/5 Vile would put the damage at  201.6 over 12.<br>
3/5 Improved would give DP a 36% proc rate.<br>
<br>
So, you can basically say with that one swing you have a 30% chance to do 201.6 damage, or 36% chance to do 180 damage. <br>
<br>
201.6 * .3 = approximately 60.48 damage added on a swing (12% increase, obviously)<br>
180 * .36 = approximately 64.8 damage added to a swing (20%)<br>
<br>
Improved would come out ahead in the little static world I've created where you swing once, but in reality, you would need to model a fight involving several procs to really see where Vile will overtake Improved. I'll leave that to the experts. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304060315im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/wink.gif" border="0" alt="" title=";)" class="inlineimg"></div>

</div>Alrighty, not to beat on this topic yet again, but I guess I actually don't know what I would like to know.  I've drawn up this chart:<br>

The ones I rely on are Cutup - specifically it's julianne module - for slice and dice timing, Classtimer for sap/stun/rupture/poison watching, Pitbull's spark module for incoming energy ticks, and Quartz for big enemy casting bars to interrupt.<br>

</div>If you are sword specced, there is no point at which it is worthwhile to use a dagger instead of a sword in your offhand. Suitably fast offhand swords are available (<a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304060315/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=28189"><span  ><span class="bluename">[Latro's Shifting Sword]</span></span></a>, <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304060315/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=28307"><span  ><span class="purplename">[Gladiator's Quickblade]</span></span></a> and its variants), and while they give up very slight increments of speed compared to daggers, an offhand sword grants you offhand sword spec procs, which account for a significant portion of your sword spec bonus damage.<br>

		<div id="post_message_585965">On the topic of Addons.. basically you need to do a few things: (I've listen the mods I use in brackets)<br>
-Watch threat (Omen)<br>
-Watch energy / combo points (EnergyWatch v2)<br>
-Watch SnD time [and other procs/dots to a lesser extent] (ClassTimer)<br>
-Watch enemy cast times (Quartz)<br>
<br>
And some more optional stuff:<br>
-Watch our own health (X-Perl)<br>
-Watch boss health and Target of Target (X-Perl)<br>
-Damage Meters (Recount)<br>
-Bar Mod (Bongos2)<br>
-Combat Text Display (Scrolling Combat Text)<br>
-Watch Boss Timers (Big Wigs)<br>
-Watch Buffs (ElkBuffBars)<br>
-Combat Log (AutoCL)<br>
-Watch Equipment Durability (DuabilityFu)<br>
-Cut down on spam (RogueSpam)<br>
-Automate Poison/Flash Powder stuff (Hemlock)<br>
<br>
I would definitely recommend Omen, ClassTimer, Quartz (especially for rogues on RoS), BigWigs (DBM works ok too), RogueSpam and Hemlock.  The rest you can get by without (default UI works ok), or there are very suitable replacements.  A good UI can definately improve your performance in a raid - a simple SnD timer of any sort will go a long way to helping your DPS.  The rest of the mods basically help keep you alive and do other helpful things.</div>

</div>It procced all the time when I tested it, but it definetly ain't worth of it for PvE. In PvP it is quite good against shapeshifting druids etc. You don't see many people using it since either they don't know it is quite good talent for PvP (or prefer some other filler) or they are AR/Prep and BladeTwisting doesn't affect hemo. For PvE, not worth. For PvP SS builds probably worth if you seem to face alot druids in arenas (2v2).</div>

</div>Aye.  I had never used the Rogue DPS chart before, mostly because it was very intimidating.  I had some free time today at work and I decided to give it another whirl, reading carefully and plugging in my values.  It's a remarkable tool, even if only theoretical in its output.  I immediately saw the difference something as simple as using <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304060315/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=28288"><span  ><span class="bluename">[Abacus of Violent Odds]</span></span></a> instead of <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304060315/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=28034"><span  ><span class="bluename">[Hourglass of the Unraveller]</span></span></a>.  The Gem counter aspect also helped me see where I was "wasting gem slots" on colors I didn't need (for example, I had 3 blue gems when my meta gem only needed two, easily adding +8 hit without losing all the other benefits, except for the one gem I replaced of course) and also helped gauge whether or not it would improve my DPS or not.<br>
<br>
Of course, I checked out my OH sword vs OH dagger and found the results pretty cool.  With Mongoose, Latro's Shifting Sword yielded a slight (~0.50%) DPS advantage over Merciless Gladiator's Shiv w/ Mongoose with a Sword Spec build.  Latro's Shifting with +15 or +20 agility enchant yielded less DPS, around 2%.<br>
<br>
Thanks for taking the time to point this stuff out.  Your initial post is top notch and very educational for me.<br>
<br>
Edit: Added DPS chart results that answered my direction question.</div>

<br>
Is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304060315/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=32658" target="_blank">Badge Of Tenacity</a> worth anything for rogues?<br>
<br>
My current trinkets are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304060315/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=28288" target="_blank">Abacus of Violent Odds</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304060315/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=28041" target="_blank">Bladefist's Breadth</a>.<br>
<br>
I read that the trinket is "The best druid tanking trinket" and I know it's an extremely rare drop and I figured I could get a bucketload of money from it, but if it doesn't sell then I was thinking I'd give it a try in a raid than sell it for 50G or shard it for a Large prismatic (which my friend seems to think is worth more than using it).<br>
<br>
I know I'll be losing 26 crit rating for useless armor but how would you measure (26 crit rating + 200 AP for 15) Vs (150 Agil for 20) ?</div>

</div>divide the stat by the uptime to get a rough estimate of the value of pop on use. 150 agi for 20 seconds, 20 seconds = 1/6th of the 2 minute cooldown, therefore, 150/6=25.<br>
<br>
it's a 25 agi trinket.<br>
By contrast, the bladefists is a 25 AP + 26 crit trinket.<br>
<br>
so it's 50 EP versus 70 EP for the bladefist.<br>
<br>
The bladefist is better, and doesn't entail giving up a large pile of cash you could be earning.<br>
<br>
Sell it to a druid.</div>

Regarding the 2nd part: yes, it does indeed look like you procced a WF attack off a Sword Spec proc - which is odd, since I seem to recall that at some point along the line it was announced or decided that that didn't happen, though I confess I don't remember the exact details.  I do know that I used to model WF-&gt;SS procs in the spreadsheet, and they're not in it anymore, and I usually don't take stuff out until we have pretty good evidence that it does not occur.  But as I don't see any other way of interpreting that combat log, we may have to rethink that.</div>

On the WF/SS proc'ing business, I did a test w/ a Shaman from my guild (thank-you Purdah/Rokabud!).  WF attacks can definately proc SS attacks.  SS attacks can definately proc WF.  Likely already known.. a single auto can proc both a WF and a SS.  Over 941 attacks, I got a single instance of 4+ attacks: Auto, WF, SS, WF.  I never saw a SS proc an SS, nor a WF proc a WF.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Excuse me, didn't found an answer on the forum yet so I have to ask here:<br>
<br>
Most classic combat swords rogues (including me) have 3 points in Vile Poisons, I know that Vile Poisons win in DPS modelling. As I understand dps modelling based on totally static fights.<br>
<br>
But what about Improved Poisons and bosses wich require high mobility from rogue and time rogue actually damaging is quite low? (and there's not much bosses where rogue can peacefully stand and repeat the cycles)</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</div><br>
In my case I've seen from the spreadsheet that Improved Poisons is a better DPS talent than Vile poisons.  Perhaps it is due to low hit rating making Deadly poison fall off, but I added hit rating until I couldn't miss and Vile was still a weaker talent than Improved.  This was with a 2.7/1.4 weapon speed and no passive haste.<br>
<br>
I added some haste rating, and found that between 200-300 I would start getting Vile as a better talent depending on unbuffed vs. buffed and what buffs were selected.  Beyond this haste rating one assumes vile becomes even better.  To note, the estimated average stack of DP with Imp Poison at 300 haste rating (with no miss) was around 4.85 whereas is was 4.50 before any modifcations.  With Vile, they are 4.58 and 4.00.<br>
<br>
Thus the admonition to go with Vile Poisons is likely because DP scales better with hit and haste gear, even if Instant gets the same benefit from both (and higher for Improved) at every gear level.  Just as I was typing this out, I realized that the real issue is because the talent tree suggestion assumes the rogue will have Windfury and thus Instant is disregarded.  That's a poor assumption for me though: I'm in a 10 man only guild (so far) and normally grouped with an enhancement shaman and hunter who would both prefer GoA and we have no DPS warriors, so I've stuck with Improved.  Indeed, switching to Windfury over Instant on the sheet shows Vile to be a better choice then.<br>
<br>
As for the suggestion offered, it's too hard to model, and using Shiv if you happen to notice the stack about to go down would likely be better than switching the talent points.</div>

</div>Unless I'm missing the reason behind Deadly Poison, this isn't true.  You need one proc every 12 seconds to refresh the stack, and any extra procs are completely wasted.  Even if your offhand only hit every 1.5 seconds on average, that's 12 chances to refresh the stack.  You have a 0.7^8 chance to NOT refresh the stack every "cycle."  That appears to be a 5-6% chance.  If you move it to a more reasonable 1.2 seconds that chance to NOT refresh changes to 3%.  So one out of every 33 "cycles" will not refresh.  Given that a "cycle" is 12 seconds, that translates to having the stack fall off every 6 minutes and 36 seconds on average.  In other words, you'd see the stack fall off once per fight.<br>
<br>
In contrast, more hit and haste gear translate directly into greater Instant Poison DPS due to the fact that no procs of the poison are wasted.</div>

		<div id="post_message_589067">RE: Imp vs. Vile Poisons, I set up a simulator to test exactly this.  My findings were at a decent gear level, vile poisons beat out improved poisons for any reasonable/intelligent gear setup (fast OH, decent amount of hit).  This is because deadly poison gets enough uptime that the increased chance to proc is largely useless.<br>
<br>
However, if I then force a periodic duration where no poison can be applied, loosely simulating a run out mechanic, improved poison improves significantly.<br>
<br>
The conclusion is, which talent is better is related to how often you have to stop DPSing the boss, as well as your chance to proc it.  HOWEVER, these talents don't have a very significant impact on your DPS, on the order of 1-3 DPS and the difference between them isn't very large.  So the bottom line is, at a certain point it's not really worth worrying about the difference.<br>
<br>
In the case that most prefers one over the other - you never miss or dodge, you never stop DPS, and you have an average of 1.0 OH (that's assuming a pretty solid amount of average haste, in addition to SnD) - the difference between 5/5 Imp and 5/5 Vile is still only ~7 DPS.<br>
<br>
If after all of this, you are still worried about it, I would recommend 2 or 3 Imp, and the rest Vile for most fights.</div>

		<div id="post_message_589208">I suppose it depends to some extent on how much you end up using potions.  Personally, I only use healing potions about 1-2 times a night, tops; if you use them at this sort of rate of consumption, the bonus to potions is basically irrelevant.  If you use them somewhat more, it would of course, have somewhat more value.<br>
<br>
Fundamentally, though: the amount of healing you get from healing potions is pretty irrelevant on most fights.  In a lot of circumstances, you just have to trust your healers - and, honestly, even if you do feel the need to pop something, I generally use the healthstone(s) before starting in on potions.  So I would argue that the survivability benefit from Alchemist's Stone is minimal at best.  Coupled with the fact that it's a huge loss of DPS (50 EAP versus 150+ for the better trinkets) means that it seems to be a pretty weak rogue trinket on the whole.

</div>With all due respect. this is one of the worst builds I've ever seen.  It's a Hemo build without Hemo, when Hemo is <i>point for point</i> the best single talent point you can spend in any tree. The trouble with subtlety builds - all subtlety builds - is not Hemo itself, or even the deeper sub tree, but the almost complete lack of any DPS talents in the Sub tree untill you get to Serrated blades.<br>
<br>
You've taken all the weak Sub talents and you don't even have Hemo to claw back some of the DPS you're throwing away.<br>
<br>
Dirty Deeds isn't a bad talent, and it's probably better than Lethality point for point. But what you need to ask is whether Master of Deception makes up for the lack of Combat Potency, or Camouflage makes up for the lack of Aggression and Vitality, or Dirty Tricks makes up for the lack of Adrenaline Rush and Surprise Attacks.<br>
<br>
Put like that, I hope the answer is obvious!<br>
<br>
Note that Hemo, on its own, is sufficient to make up for <i>all</i> these shortcomings at lower gear levels, though it does still get outpaced at higher gear levels.  But a sub build without Hemo makes about as much sense as using Sinister Strike with daggers.</div>

</div>That's more likely due to cycle errors than actual spec errors ... though given your previous spec I won't assert that strongly.   11/27/22 +1 Hemo should be within acceptable range of combat swords unless you're deep into T6, and even then I think the jury is still out.</div>

As others have said, if you're going 11/2x/2x then take Hemo as your personal dps will increase and your contribution to overall raid dps will skyrocket.  That's the purpose of the Subtlety tree in PvE, you sacrifice personal dps to increase the dps of others.</div>

- Finally, is there a mod out there that will alert me when I've met positional req's for BS to make it easier? Something to help keep me behind my targets in the tightly cluttered trash mobs.<br>

<br>
It came from a discussion within my rogue squad after one of us swordies took Tracker's Blade in order to prevent it from being disenchanted. Since it's stat-wise and dps-wise clearly better than Season 2 sword, only logical thing to do is to use it, however nobody in this thread mentions having 5/5 Sword Spec and 5/5 Dagger Spec at the same time. That rogue is using Talon of Azshara in his mainhand.<br>
<br>
One of us is using 5/5 Fist Spec + 5/5 Sword Spec for quite some time and it works like a charm.<br>

The key to a hybrid Fist/Sword spec is that the offhand attacks proc the Mainhand swings, while still getting the 5% crit bonus. With the standard sword spec, you have room to drop some filler talents (poisons) However daggers are at a 1.8 attack speed generally, so extra-attacks would do siginificantly less damage. You also would have to drop Lethality and 1 point on opportunity. It just wouldn't be viable. I could see a Mace/Sword Hybrid working though.

				<div style="font-style:italic">You got this the wrong way, maybe I wasn't clear enough.

		<div id="post_message_590806"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->His answer was true - I'd be surprised if it wasn't mentioned in some sense in the first post of this thread, but it's certainly been discussed and described many times in rogue threads on this forum:<br>
<br>
If you have a MH that you are specced for, the MH dps increase from spec alone of fist, sword, mace and dagger are equivalent (no, not the same, but in the same range)<br>
<br>
The reason swords is a better weapon spec than any other weapon spec is (put simply) that the sword spec taking effect on an OH swings gives you MH size benefits.<br>
<br>
I'm sure it'll come as no surprise to you that OH hits for less than MH. <br>
If you are dagger spec and your OH dagger hits - your OH dmg is increased by the factor of the dagger spec.<br>
If you are fist spec and you OH fist hits - your OH dmg is increased by the factor of the fist spec.<br>
If you are mace spec and you OH mace hits - your OH dmg is increased by the factor of mace fist spec.<br>
If you are sword spec and your OH sword hits - your OH dmg is the same - but you get an additional MH swing, and since the MH damage is in a much higher range than the OH range, this makes sword spec with a sword in the OH better than any other weapon spec.<br>
<br>
Fist/sword uses this mechanism - a sword in the OH so you get the main benefit of sword spec (an extra MH swing applied to a fist which then has increased crit from fist spec also)<br>
<br>
There is no way that sword MH and dagger OH can be considered a comparable spec to fist/sword. You are throwing away the main benefit of the sword spec in comparison to other weapon specs by wielding a dagger and not a sword in the OH.<br>
<br>
It's a bad idea based on the above principles alone. Without wasting too much of my time on something that I know intuitively is a bad idea, the fact that the dagger is 1.5 spd makes me pay attention for different reasons. As the first post in this thread will tell you when it comes to OH weapons faster is better and for a dagger 1.5 is considered slow.<br>
<br>
All this aside - 5 minutes spent with the dps or the gear spreadsheet would have given you an equally clear answer. It's a bad idea and a dps loss.<br>
<br>
To basically repeat what tymoney321 said...<br>
If you are sword, dagger, mace or fist spec with two weapons of that type: 100% of MH attacks potentially gain dps from your weapon spec. 100% of OH attacks potentially gain dps from weapon spec.<br>
If you are sword and fist specced, with a sword in the OH and fist in the MH: 100% of MH attacks potentially gain dps from your fist spec. 100% of OH attacks potentially gain dps from sword AND fist spec.<br>
If you are sword and dagger specced with a sword in the MH and a dagger in the OH: 100% of MH attacks potentially gain dps from your sword spec. 100% of OH attacks potentially gain dps from your dagger spec (only - and this seems to be denied by the previous poster, something of which I'm not certain - presenting the ideal case, assume dagger spec applies).<br>
<br>
In the above (edit note: fist/sword spec), the loss of talent points in poison talents is for the most part justified from a dps perspective by the AND in this sentence:<br>
100% of OH attacks potentially gain dps from sword AND fist spec.<br>
<br>
With what you're looking at there is no such redeeming feature.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
Find Weakness is what makes Mutilate work so well. You get a ton of combo points, and when you're constantly using finishers, Find Weakness is up almost all the time. It's a HUGE damage buff. Improved Poisons is really only to give you a significant DPS increase if you're sporting Instant Poison, which is a big no-no with Mutilate. If you aren't speccing Find Weakness, you might as well just stick to Backstab because all those finishers you'll be doing with Mutilate won't matter nearly as much without the extra 10% damage. <br>
<br>
But, equally concerning is your choice of Opportunity over Dual Wield Specialization. Read the first post of this thread carefully - it's a poor choice to make.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_590991"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I thought DW was only a slight improvement over opporturnity. Isn't opportunity better for burst damage?

<br>
I will continue to read through this thread, and I thank you for your thoughts on Find Weakness, that does make a lot of sense.<br>

		<div id="post_message_591023"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I say forget Improved Poisons and Shiv on the Crippling Poison. Wounding will stack fast enough between instant attacks and autoattacks, and since you are using Mutilate the offhand attack component + autoattacks should be enough to keep Crippling up after the initial Shiv.<br>
<br>
Find Weakness is much superior to either Vile or Improved Poisons. Improved vs. vile are more interchangeable, but for PvP I'd say keep vile and drop improved.<br>
<br>
Something you may not know about DW spec is that it increases the offhand <i>bonus</i> damage of your Mutilate attack (not just the weapon damage portion), which makes it very good at lower gear levels. For Mutilate, it is almost a tossup between Opportunity and DW Spec, but the white damage (and Shiv) benefits of DW Spec make it the clear winner.<br>
<br>
Lets assume you have equal damage range weapons in both hands:<br>
<br>
Mutilate -&gt; DMG = (WeaponDmg + 101) + (WeaponDmg*0.5 + 101) = 1.5*WeaponDmg + 202<br>
Mutilate w/ Opportunity -&gt; DMG = ((WeaponDmg + 101) + (WeaponDmg*0.5 + 101))*1.2 = 1.8*WeaponDmg + 242<br>
Mutilate w/ DW Spec -&gt; DMG = (WeaponDmg + 101) + (WeaponDmg*0.5 + 101)*1.5 = 1.75*WeaponDmg + 252<br>
<br>
With Opportunity you get a Mutilate attack that scales <i>very slightly</i> better with your weapon damage, but with DW Spec you get a higher base damage (by 10) plus much improved white damage. DW Spec is the clear winner overall.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>No offense man, but this is pretty much a PvE only thread.  Check out the first post, I believe it references that all the discussion in here are related to PvE matters.   I would suggest checking out the PvP forum on these boards instead.<br>
<br>
That said, DW is significantly more damage than Opportunity.  In fact, DW is nearly as much of an increase to your Mutilates alone, compared to Opportunity.  If your interest is PvP however, you'll likely be taking MoD and stuff.. so Opportunity is sort of a default choice.<br>
<br>
<br>
Re: Swords + Daggers<br>
As mentioned already, the power of sword spec is that OH attacks proc MH swings.  Those MH swings aren't affected by DW penalty, and additionally have a much slower swing time (thus higher dmg range).  Having 5% more crit on an OH attack is pretty whimpy.  Having a 1.5spd weapon proc a 2.6+ spd attack is pretty OP.  <b>Any dual-spec build requires a sword in the OH to be potentially viable</b>.  A Dagger-MH, Sword OH is bad too, considering you're now attempting to backstab and such.. which is basically all the horrors of Combat Daggers.  Not to mention you negate the bulk of the strength of sword spec since your extra attacks are now at a 1.8spd instead of 2.6+.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I know the healing bonus is great too. I especially like how it works on bandages, healing pots and healthstones too, but wouldn't switching the two points to a PvE damage oriented talent be more useful?<br>
<br>
My current hit is 16.55%, I am way passed the finisher cap so this talent only saves me energy from dodges. Wouldn't a talent like Murder (yes, I don't have murder) be more useful for DPS?<br>
<br>
Optional talents to spend points are: <br>
Murder<br>
Last point in Imp Poisons + 1 more somewhere else<br>
Fleet Footed (run speed increase is nice but I consider this a mostly useless talent)<br>
<br>
So basically the question boils down to QR vs Murder<br>

</div>0 expertise currently. So you're saying it's best to stick to QR? QR energy return would outweigh murder dps increase at low expertise?<br>

As for 3/3 imp evisc: I use evisc A LOT! SnD never runs out and rupture might be down for 1-2 seconds between cycles and I still have time for an eviscerate (sometimes 2).

</div>In a perfect world you'd be getting windfury (yes even for mutilate) and unless you envenom your dp is not going to fall off so any utility you can gain from imp poisons goes away in the first 20 seconds of a boss fight.<br>
<br>
If you're worried about your VR damage that much then realize murder is pretty much useless to you. Figure out how many finishers you use in a minute. Make 5% of them dodges then figure out how much energy you waste. Figure out how much Damage Per Energy you're wasting without QR. Convert that to DPS.  If it works out to more then ~20 dps (about all I can see murder realistically adding at your progression level considering the bosses it even works on are maybe half? of t5) then QR is better.</div>

</div>Master Poisoner doesn't replace "spell hit" type misses right? It would only get rid of partials? 1/2 Master poison is good but I'm not sure you need a second point in pve. It really depends what it actually does.<br>
<br>
I think someone worked it out on these boards, I'll edit this post if I can find it.<br>
<br>
And for the guy with mutilate questions, murder is still better dps then imp poisons on any fight it works on. 2% of 100% your dps &gt;6% increase of 4-5%.</div>

I searched and searched but I couldn't seem to find posts explaining what MP actually did. I remember Kalman talking about it ages ago but I had no luck tracking it down. Does MP reduce partials? complete misses? Anyone?<br>
<br>
Yeah this entire derail is about IP when DP is all that really matters since you really shouldn't be speccing for optimizing your dps in suboptimal groups....unless your guild just doesn't have shaman or you are your guild's redheaded stepchild rogue who never gets good dps groups. In that second case you probably don't want to be limping along with mutilate since that's probably why you might be getting the shit group anyway.</div>

How would you optimize 3/5 cycle with AR? I find myself poping it up and then go totaly random, at teh end losing either rupture uptime or refreshing SnD. Is there any good sequence you are aware of, that maximize it's use. If so, when to pop it, after applying rupture? Before?

I'd suggest to fire AR in your standard cycle, just after 3 SnD. This ensures you get guaranteed enough ComboPoints for 2 5pt finisher and some time to build up ComboPoints for a new SnD.</div>

<br>
First of all, thanks for putting so much effort in this thread, and with that helping me on several issues I had.<br>
<br>
Now to what troubles me.<br>
1. Windfury. Does it trigger from styles too, or only white attacks? I'm simply not sure about it, and even as it is in wrong thread perhaps, I wonder if a Shaman using WF on both weaps can get a proc from both weapons when using Stormstrike.<br>
<br>
2. If I understand right, procs like mongoose or DST are set to 1/60s(i.e.), and this rate is then used on your weapon speed. So a 2.00 speed weapon would have 3,33% to proc.<br>
This means, that any haste effect I get loweres the time I have those buffs up, as the chance decreases with haste, and so my styles trigger the proc less often. Is that correct?<br>
<br>
3. +x Weapon Damage Enchant is used as a static bonus as far as I have seen. Yet on my paladin which is wielding one handed sword with +4 weapon damage enchant, it seems to be not a static bonus, but a +4 dps instead.<br>
To show:<br>
I'm specced protection there, thus I have 5% bonus damage and need to get to 100% always.<br>
The weapon I am using has got 48,8dps(at 2.00 speed) and the +4 weapon damage enchant.<br>
<br>
The dps shown for my weapon hits on the paladin is 106,5 dps(105% dmg)-&gt; 101,4286(100% dmg)<br>
On unequipping the weapon, there is 51,1 dps(48,6667dps with 100%dmg) left.<br>
Difference is 101,524-48,6667=52,7619 (~48,8+4=52,8), which leads me to the impression, that the enchant is +4 dps, not +4dmg on hit, as else the dps of the weapon self should have been 50,8.<br>
<br>
Has anyone else here yet done any testing on that and can confirm this or tell me where my fault is?<br>
<br>
I have noticed the same for the scopes on ranged weapons by the way, but I dont have any number there right atm.<br>
<br>
I just state this, as it would mean, that pre-mongoose, your best choice for enchants would be +7dmg on MH and +20agi on OH.</div>

</div>1 - WF used to trigger from other attacks, as of (a few patches ago) it only triggers from auto attacks.  That said, special attacks can proc Sword Spec, which can in turn proc WF.  The WF Totem (what rogues and warriors will be getting) has no internal CD and can proc as often as you can swing, averaging 20%.  WF Weapon however, the thing only shaman can get (similar to rogue poisons) has a 3-second internal CD.  Thus, if your MH attack from Stormstrike procs WF, the OH attack cannot.  WF Weapon grants 2 additional attacks - it is superior to WF Totem for a shaman.<br>
<br>
2 - To the best of our collective knowledge, you are right for auto attacks.  Most proc-based things (DST, etc) are on a PPM (procs per minute) basis to allow for fast and slow weapons to gain roughly the same benefit from them.  For auto attacks, it appears to take your current hasted speed into account when to determine a % chance.  For specials, it appears to take the base weapon speed.  This basically means that haste is not a factor for proc chances.  Again, this could be wrong, as testing for such subtle differences to any degree of reasonable confidence is just quite difficult (10's or 100's of thousands of swings worth of testing)<br>
<br>
3 - Are you looking at the paperdoll stats or testing hitting something?  I'm not sure myself how this works but it certainly is an important area to test.  Perhaps we could have an enchanter run around hitting snakes with a 1-2 dps weapon with and then without a ring w/ Striking equipped.</div>

</div>I looked at the paperdoll stats, but as said, it just surprised me being like that, as it was the same for ranged weapons and scopes.<br>
I'll see if I can get my paladin later and do some testing with a 1-2dps weapon and enchanting +4dmg on it.</div>

<br>
If we assume an offhand is hitting every 1.15 seconds, that means it will more or less hit the target 10 times after a DP proc before the stack falls off.  Assuming a 100% hit chance and no poison resists, that's a 0.7^10, or nearly a 3% chance for the stack to fall off.<br>
<br>
DP ticks for a base of 225 at a five stack, I believe, which is a contribution of 75 DPS.  Adding 3 points in Vile Poisons (going by the Combat Swords build in the first post) adds 12% damage to poisons, or a a DPS increase of 9 (3 per point).<br>
<br>
Conversely, getting three points in Improved Poisons reduces the chance to fall off to 0.64^10, or a 1.1% chance.  Playing around with the rogue gear spreadsheet has given me the following results: 1 point in Vile Poisons is just over a 2 DPS increase (probably from factoring in resists and possibly the stack falling of) while 1 point in Improved Poisons didn't adjust the DPS by more than 0.1-0.2 DPS, if I recall correctly.<br>
<br>
Is a 12% increase in poison damage truly 10 times better than cutting the chance for the stack to fall off in third?  Does this seem to be a logical conclusion?</div>

	</table>
</div>So, first off, let me say that the Deadly Poison model in the Rogue Gear Spreadsheet is not what it might be.  It is, in fact, probably one of the least accurate aspects of the sheet.  It's designed as a reasonable ballpark figure and not a whole lot more - basically because actually computing uptime is rather hard (by which I mean: I don't know how to do it off the top of my head, and haven't gotten around to looking it up).  So it's entirely possible that I'm over or underestimating the value of some of the poison talents in the sheet.  However, for the sake of argument, lets look at the numbers for a minute.<br>
<br>
So, firstly, your calculation above neglects the chance that a Deadly Poison application is resisted.  So, in practice, the application rates for 0 and 1 point in Improved Poisons are not 30 and 32 percent, but .83 times that, or 24.9 and 26.56 percent.<br>
<br>
So, if we then do your calculation above with those probabilities, the chance to fall off is 5.71% without improved poisons, and 4.56% with 1 point in Improved Poisons.  So, that one point in Improved Poisons reduces the chance of the stack to fall off by almost 25%.  And when you say it that way, it sounds great.<br>
<br>
But, lets now consider what this actually means in practice.  What is this "chance to fall off" parameter, and how does it relate to damage?  Well, a moment's thought indicates that what this actually is is the downtime percentage of the poison - that is, what fraction of the time you *don't* have at least one Deadly Poison stack up.  But that, by itself, is not really that interesting a number; what we care about is how often Deadly Poison *is* up, as that's when it's doing damage.  And the increase in uptime is roughly (1-.0456) / (1-.0571) = 1.012, so the actual increase in uptime is only about 1.2%.  And since poison does 75 DPS while applied, that works out to about .9 DPS.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, this doesn't totally tell the story either.  One must estimate the amount of time it takes poison to stack up after dropping and some stuff like that - which is where all this turns truly messy.  So this .9 DPS number is certainly off; how far off is hard to say, but, for the sake of argument, we'll go with it.<br>
<br>
Now, .9 DPS is more than you observed in the sheet; but lets look at our assumptions for a moment.  10 attacks between Deadly Poison refreshes is basically consistent with a 1.5 speed weapon and no haste effects of any kind.  If you have any haste effects - or a 1.4 speed OH - or both, you will tend to attack more frequently than this.  And a little massaging of the numbers shows that the more attacks you're making, the less difference Improved Poisons makes on a percentage basis.  So most people will probably observe somewhat less than that difference in the spreadsheet.<br>
<br>
Now, admittedly, even with itemization as specified - no haste procs and a 1.5 speed OH - the spreadsheet only estimates about .5 DPS for the first point in Improved Poisons versus the .9 we estimated, so it is entirely possible that there's a bug in the sheet; however, it does get the fundamental point correct (namely, that Vile Poisons is better with Deadly Poison), and a difference on the scale of 1 DPS out of 1500 is not going to skew the other results of the sheet in a meaningful way.  Hence, I'm not too inclined to worried about the problem.  Maybe it's right, and maybe it's wrong, but either way it's pretty close.  The next time I'm releasing a major version of the sheet I'll revisit the issue and see if I can tune things up; in the meantime, I think it's fine.</div>

	</table>
</div>So, the thing is, I did actually try to account for stack-up time when I wrote the model in the Rogue Gear sheet.  Looking back, though, it does appear that I may have bungled it.  So, in the interest of professional curiosity, lets work over deadly poison modeling for a moment.<br>
<br>
Let n = the number of attacks that hit in the average second made with weapons that have deadly poison on them.  That is, if you're using Deadly Poison on OH, this is the number of OH attacks per second times the chance that an OH attack hits.<br>
<br>
Let m be the probability that Deadly Poison procs on a given hit.<br>
<br>
Then p = .83 * m * n is the probability that Deadly Poison is applied in a given second.  Let q = 1-p.<br>
<br>
It is easy to see that the uptime of Deadly Poison - that is, the fraction of the time when you have at least one proc up - is 1-q^12.  But how do we account for ramp-up time?<br>
<br>
Well, the immediate idea which occurs to me is that we can estimate the duration of the average Deadly Poison gap, and use that to estimate how frequently such gaps occur.<br>
<br>
Let us assume that 12 seconds have elapsed since our last proc, so Deadly Poison has just ticked off.  At this point, Deadly Poison starts up again with probability p each second thereafter; that is, with probability p it occurs in the first second, with probability p*q in the second, and so on.  Thus, the expected time until the stack starts again is the sum of the infinite series p + 2pq + 3pq^2 + .... which is easily shown to be equal to 1/p.  Hence, the average downtime between the end of the last proc and the beginning of the next is 1/p, and the uptime is 1-q^12; hence, to determine X, the average duration of one "cycle" - that is, one uptime period followed by one downtime period - we simply solve q^12 = (1/p)/X, or X = 1/(pq^12)<br>
<br>
Next question: how long does it take poison to ramp up?  Well, by the above, it's an average of 1/p seconds between procs, so it takes an average of 5/p seconds to stack back up.  Thus, out of our cycle of length 1/(pq^12), we spend 1/p time with no poison up, 1/p with one stack on, 1/p with 2 stacks on, and so on.  Thus, the total damage *lost* relative to continuous uptime is (5+4+3+2+1) * 1/p in each period of length 1/pq^12.  Thus, the average number of stacks up is given by 5 - (15/p)/(1/pq^12) = 5 - 15q^12 = 5 * (1 - 3q^12).  Now, in the Rogue Gear Spreadsheet, I have 5 - 3q^12, so it appears that the bug in the gear sheet is that I neglected to distribute the 5 correctly when I entered it into the sheet.  I'll make a point to fix that in the next release.<br>
<br>
Note that this still isn't a 100% accurate model, since it implicitly assumes that poison always stacks up to 5 before dropping off - which isn't true.  This is why, for instance, if you plug p = 0 into the above formula, you find that you average -10 stacks of poison up, which clearly isn't true.  But for reasonably high poison application rates - that is, where 5/p is small compared to 1/pq^12, it should be reasonably accurate.  But when implementing this in, for instance, a spreadsheet, you probably want to perform a check to verify that the poison application rate is high enough to get good results.<br>
<br>
As an additional note: this provides a lower bound for poison uptime; we obtain an easy upper bound via the simple uptime calculation (ignoring ramp-up time).  So it is valid to say that N, the average number of stacks up, satisfies 5*(1-3q^12) &lt;= N &lt;= 5*(1-q^12)<br>
<br>
Edit: Oh, it also doesn't factor in that uptime periods are at least 12 seconds in length, which skews the probability distributions some.  Still, it's not a bad estimate when p is on the order of .2 - which it usually is.</div>

		<div id="post_message_596271">First and foremost I wanna thanks those before me for the massive work done on our theorycrafting.  The post above that explores DP on the spreadsheets while a great read should not be attempted before at least two cups of coffee, as now my head hurts.  I've been lurking for months here and, so thanks for all the late night reading and topics to ponder in afternoon traffic.<br>
<br>
I don't know everything about everything nor recall (or have likely not read) every single post here.  In instances where the killing is fast, be it simple mobs or overload DPS, I use IP both MH and OH.  Like running Kara with the group I was recently running with, it made no sense to try to build my 5 stack and then sustain that for a certain time to make DP an effective/superior substitute for IP.<br>
<br>
I like numbers, am not NEAR the math head that some of the big guns are here.  Is there a simple formula or model to determine approximate length where DP comes into it's own?  I am thinking that I can probably extrapolate it from the aforementioned poison post, but I've yet finished my first cup of coffee.<br>
<br>
If it is simple and I just can't spy it, forgive the silly questions and thanks again for making my rogue an effin' blast to tinker with!</div>

		<div id="post_message_596320">I'm pretty sure I followed all that, with the exception of the simplifications of the series (which I am totally willing to trust you on). Where I got hung up was the 3*q^12, which you are saying should be 15*q^12. When it was just the 3*q^12, it basically looked like the assumption was that the poison was dealing 3/5 less DPS for the times it was down, since downtime is given by 1*q^12. Following your math, it makes more sense now.<br>
<br>
It certainly seems a good way to model it without being too overly complicated. The factor of 5 difference in the "average stacks" formula will reduce poison DPS by a good bit, which makes sense intuitively to me.<br>
<br>
I was getting hung up on the 12 second thing just as you are... since the periods have to be at least 12 seconds long I didn't know how to approach it. However, as long as the average cycle length 1/(pq^12) is fairly long, then few enough "dropoffs" will fall way low on the probability curve and it looks like a good model.<br>
<br>
I like it.<br>
<br>
Now, models are great, but in engineering we always put real numbers back in to the model to verify that we get results that make sense. So, let's do that for a typical rogue. For example, me (as I'm mid-geared). I have, unbuffed, +18.33% hit from gear, +5% hit from talents, and +10 expertise (-2.5% dodge) from talents. Thus my hit table for my offhand looks like:<br>
<br>
Miss + Dodge = (6.3 + 28) - (18.33 + 5 + 2.5) = 8.47%<br>
Hit + Crit = 91.53%<br>
<br>
Offhand weapon speed is 1.5, increased by Haste to 1.47, increased by SnD to 1.13.<br>
<br>
DP Proc Chance = 30% (no talents in improved)<br>
<br>
p = (1 - 0.17) * (0.3) * (0.9153/1.13) ~= 0.202<br>
<br>
<i>This is in the range where we thought the prediction should be valid. Good.</i><br>
<br>
q = 1-p = 798<br>
<br>
Average downtime = 1/p = 4.95 sec<br>
Average uptime = 1/(pq^12) = 74.23 sec<br>
Cycle time = 4.95 + 74.23 = 79.18 sec ~= 1 min 19 sec<br>
<br>
<i>Hmm, average uptime seems a bit low. Does DP really fall off so much? That surprises me.</i><br>
<br>
Average stacks = 5 - 15*q^12 = 4.00<br>
<br>
<i>This seems to be a reasonable result. I can try to check my poison DPS on some fights to see if I'm hitting more or less 4 stacks on average. Should help verify the model. Others could try their own numbers and compare to WWS or w/e as well.</i><br>
<br>
Interesting; I'm only getting an average of 4 stacks on the target due to DP falling off. This begs the question, how does it compare to IP?<br>
<br>
<b>DP</b> -&gt; 4.00 stacks * 180/12 = 60 DPS<br>
<b>IP</b> -&gt; ((146 + 194)/2) * (1 - 0.17) * (0.2) * (0.9153/1.13) = 22.85 DPS<br>
<br>
DP is still clearly better.<br>
<br>
What about Improved Poisons vs. Vile Poisons? Well, with 5/5 Vile you see a 20% increase. With 5/5 Improved?<br>
<br>
p = (1 - 0.17) * (0.4) * (0.9153/1.13) ~= 0.269<br>
q = 0.731<br>
Avg. stacks = 5 - 15*q^12 = 4.65<br>
<br>
4.65 / 4.00 ~= 1.163, or a 16.3% DPS increase. (Also, it gives a smoother uptime and faster ramp-ups after stopped DPS.)<br>
<br>
So, comparable, with Vile being a little better for static fights and improved possibly being better for dynamic ones.</div>

</div>Yes, calculating DP damage is extremely hard.  There is actually very little in terms of simple models that you can use beyond just running a simulation.  The problems are due to the damage being dealt every three seconds and not caring about what happens other times, a varying number of attacks each three seconds, and another very interesting feature for which I have to make a few assumptions clear before stating:<br>
<br>
1) Three seconds after the first application, and every three seconds there after, damage will be done based on the number of doses on at that time.<br>
2) The stack will fall off if it does damage 4 times without being refreshed in the meantime.<br>
<br>
These are based on observations I made as a rogue where a stack will fall off before the Blizzard UI says it should, and always right as it ticks with less than 3 seconds left.  This means that the probability of the stack falling off is greater when it is refreshed closer to the time it ticks.  Given that we're looking to get a good grasp at this probability, this feature puts a whole new twist into it.  The idea though is to hope that things average out in the long run and probabilities calculated will tend towards the actual events in the limiting case.  The question just becomes how to model it effectively, as you can't just look a the probability of it not being refreshed in 12 seconds.<br>
<br>
I'm just starting a class in stochastic processes, where stochastic is a fancy word meaning "random".  I anticipate this class will introduce tools for modeling behaviors very similar to DP.  However, I would have thought that given its a low-level grad course, that *someone* on these boards would have already taken courses in this sort of thing.<br>
<br>
The first topic discussed in the class is something called Markov chains, which I first encountered in middle school when looking at probabilities of landing on spaces on a Monopoly board.  They model stochastic processes where the probability of transitions from one state to another are solely determined by the current state.  Under this assumption, it is very easy to determine long term behavior of the system and relative time spent in each state.  Consider the following states:<br>
<br>
1: No DP<br>
2: 1 DP dose, has ticked 0 times since last refresh.<br>
3: 1 DP dose, has ticked 1 time.<br>
4: 1 DP dose, has ticked 2 times.<br>
5: 1 DP dose, has ticked 3 times.<br>
6-9: 2 DP dose, has ticked 0-3 times.<br>
10-13: 3, etc<br>
14-17: 4, etc<br>
18-21: 5, etc<br>
<br>
Recall that if it ticks 4 times without being refreshed it will fall off regardless if that's 9.1s or 11.9s since last application.<br>
<br>
Every 3 seconds the state changes (or in the case of states 1 and 18, maybe not).  State 1 goes to state 2 with probability p, where p is the chance for exactly one poison proc, it goes to state 6 with chance q, where q is the chance for exactly 2 procs, and so on.  States 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, and 21 go to State 1 if no poison procs occur, while in any other state it jumps to the next higher numbered state in that case.  <br>
<br>
If we're truly modeling long-term behavior we can average out SnD downtime/BF/Drums/etc into weapon speed and thus poison procs so that the probabilities are constant.  One problem with this model is that in reality when DP falls off the 3-second timer resets when DP is reapplied (by assumption - correct me if I'm wrong), while this model assumes the state changes every 3 seconds.  There might be a way around this, but I haven't thought hard about it yet.<br>
<br>
One can form a transition matrix where the entries correspond to the probabilities of going from one state to the next, and the long term behavior can be found by taking the matrix and multiplying it by itself until the entries either become stable or change periodically.  I'm assuming that the former will happen in this case.  This is a rather naive approach to using the transition matrix to determine long term behavior, and there may be better ways of solving them.  However, it is something that can be programmed for a computer to do without thinking and thus possibly calculate the behavior based on changing variables as spreadsheets do currently.<br>
<br>
It looks to be quite a daunting task to figure out each of the necessary probabilities in general form and I'm not all that swift with spreadsheets.  I'll try to think about the situation more and chime in when I figure stuff out.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Now, models are great, but in engineering we always put real numbers back in to the model to verify that we get results that make sense. So, let's do that for a typical rogue. For example, me (as I'm mid-geared). I have, unbuffed, +18.33% hit from gear, +5% hit from talents, and +10 expertise (-2.5% dodge) from talents. Thus my hit table for my offhand looks like:<br>
<br>
Miss + Dodge = (6.3 + 28) - (18.33 + 5 + 2.5) = 8.47%<br>
Hit + Crit = 91.53%<br>
<br>
Offhand weapon speed is 1.5, increased by Haste to 1.47, increased by SnD to 1.13.<br>
<br>
DP Proc Chance = 30% (no talents in improved)<br>
<br>
p = (1 - 0.17) * (0.3) * (0.9153/1.13) ~= 0.202<br>
<br>
<i>This is in the range where we thought the prediction should be valid. Good.</i><br>
<br>
q = 1-p = 798<br>
<br>
Average downtime = 1/p = 4.95 sec<br>
Average uptime = 1/(pq^12) = 74.23 sec<br>
Cycle time = 4.95 + 74.23 = 79.18 sec ~= 1 min 19 sec<br>
<br>
<i>Hmm, average uptime seems a bit low. Does DP really fall off so much? That surprises me.</i><br>
<br>
Average stacks = 5 - 15*q^12 = 4.00</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</div>In the interest of checking the accuracy of all this, I wrote a little program to simulate what we're modeling - that is, that every 1 second there is a chance p that poison is applied, which stacks to 5 and refreshes, and then totals up the average poison level across the duration of the test - specifically, the following Python program:<br>
<br>
<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px">
	<div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom:0px"><img src="/web/20080302201816im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/chestnut/misc/code_html.gif" border="0"></div>
	<pre class="alt2" dir="ltr" style="
		margin: 0px;
		padding: 3px;
		border: 1px inset;
		width: 694px;
		height: 418px;
		text-align: left;
		overflow: auto">from random import random

testLen = 100000000

curTime = 0

p = .202
q = 1 - p

stacks = 0
lastProc = 0

totalStacks = 0

while curTime &lt; testLen:
    if random() &lt; p:
        stacks = stacks + 1
        if stacks &gt; 5:
            stacks = 5
        lastProc = curTime
    else:
        if curTime - lastProc == 12:
            stacks = 0
        
    totalStacks = totalStacks + stacks
    curTime = curTime + 1
    
totalStacks += 0.0
print totalStacks/testLen</pre>
</div>I ran 2 trials of  100 million seconds of simulated poison application each; the average number of stacks applied was 4.0847 in the first test and 4.0858 for the second.  So, suffice it to say, the average number of stacks for your number is about 4.085 in our model, versus 4.00 predicted by my estimate.  So, we're about 2% low, which is probably adequate for the moment.<br>
<br>
Then, of course, there's the issue that our model doesn't exactly reflect reality; in reality, the chance to apply does not occur once a second, but once per attack (which can be either over or under once per second, can change over time, etc.), and the fact that Deadly Poison doesn't tick 12 times spaced one second apart, but 4 times spaced 3 seconds apart.  On the whole, though, these strike me as unlikely to significantly change the overall answer, so I'm content with this estimate for spreadsheet purposes.<br>
<br>
Oh, and re: Glowacks.  You're right, we are making many simplifying assumptions in these models which may or may not affect the accuracy of the estimates; however, solving the problem analytically is prohibitively hard.  One could solve this average stacks problem reasonably easy if one could diagonalize the 15x15 transition matrix; but computing Eigenvalues of a 15x15 matrix is pretty hard, and, in particular, does not have any closed-form solution.  So the trick is not so much knowing the math to write down the exact formula for the answer, but finding a reasonably good estimate that can be included in spreadsheets for purposes of damage estimation.  I make no claims that our simplifying assumptions will be exact - but as long as they're close, that's enough.</div>

		<div id="post_message_597121">I'm not going to suggest that using an higher level analytical model is at all "easier" or provides anything resembling a "better" picture because there's still a lot of assumptions made that aren't true in practice, but I was hoping that perhaps someone with a bit more background could possibly fill in the holes.  However, thinking about the problem has led me to consider the major point I mentioned above that hasn't been addressed by other models: the poison only has to tick 4 times since last application in order to fall off.  In the long run this should be approximately every 10.5 seconds, unless there's something going on I'm not considering.  This seems to be an accurate simplifying assumption that better connects with reality.</div>

I'd like to spec something like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302201816/http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=f0eboZ0eV0bVzZEMxo0hRoL" target="_blank">Talent Calculator - World of Warcraft</a> just for a change of pace, I've been combat for as long as I've raided and the idea of playing something different seems refreshing.<br>
<br>
From the old thread it seemed as if the consensus was that the core DPS talents in sub are Serrated Blade, Hemorrhage, Dirty Deeds and deadliness with the lower tiers being mostly filler.  I'll be taking some points in deadliness since the best MH is have is the Big Bad Wolf's Paw.  The latest spreadsheet from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302201816/http://rogue.raidcal.clom/" target="_blank">http://rogue.raidcal.com</a> with the 2.3.3 changes has 11/20/30 slightly higher than 11/21/29 in my gear, but I was wondering if anyone had practical experience from using blade flurry over that last point in deadliness?  My intuition tells me that the point in blade flurry will serve me better but it's hard to argue with the spreadsheet.<br>

</div>Since I took prep to get down to deadliness I figured a 3.5 cooldown on a Vanish which is reset by Prep is kind of overkill and it seems like the old thread indicated that you couldn't really count on Setup for reliable combo points even with Evasion/CloS since it's only a 45% chance.  My reasoning was that some degree of predictably increased damage was better from filler than maybe getting a combo point.</div>

My current spec is 20/41/0, swords, and has been for some time now.  I am completely satisfied with my current damage output.<br>
<br>
However, I am inquisitive, and after looking at the patch notes for 2.3.2 I thought I would play around with some of the numbers.  I posted my results and asked for constructive feedback on the WoW class forums, but received no good discussion from it.<br>
<br>
Here is a link to the post:<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302201816/http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=3881820348&amp;sid=1" target="_blank">WoW Forums -&gt; 20/0/41</a><br>
<br>
To sum it up, I wanted to ask you guys to give me some figures as to why applying Shadowstep to a 5cp Rupture 19-20 times over the course of a 10+ minute boss fight (combined with the other raiding benefits of the Subtlety tree with a 20/0/41 build) does not make up for the loss of energy regen and attack speed bonuses found in the combat tree.<br>
<br>
I appreciate your input, and look forward to reading what you come up with.<br>
<br>
My apologies if this was posted earlier, I looked but was unable to locate any related topic.</div>

		<div id="post_message_597936">Well, you're losing 5% to hit, 25% offhand damage (from .5 multiplier to .75), Combat Potency's energy regeneration, agression, surprise attacks, sword spec, and imp slice &amp; dice... to get Serrated Blades, Hemo, Deadliness, Sinister Calling, and Shadowstep.  <br>
<br>
Rupture just isn't enough of your damage to make that spec viable.<br>
<br>
For detailed analysis, check with the spreadsheets linked in the first post.<br>

		<div id="post_message_597946">So, short answer:<br>
<br>
A fully talented, mangled rupture does on the order of 2500 damage. Hence, each Shadowstep adds about 500 damage.  However, each Shadowstep also costs 10 energy, which is 10 energy no longer being spent on Hemo; assuming a typical hemo hits for around 600 (which is probably actually low), the energy loss also costs you about 150 damage.  So the next damage increase of Shadowstep is on the order of 350 damage every 30 seconds - or about 12 DPS.<br>
<br>
Now, compare to, say, a single point in dual-wield spec.  If you have a 90 DPS OH and 2100 AP (pretty easy for any rogue in a 25 man raid), each point in Dual Wield spec is worth about 18 DPS.  So the total contribution of Shadowstep is less than a single point in DW Spec.<br>
<br>
Fundamentally:  sure, there are some good DPS talents in subtlety.  Hemo is a great talent, and Deadliness, Sinister Calling, and Serrated Blades aren't bad.  The problem is: there are even more good talents in combat, and the combined damage contribution of Improved Sinister Strike, Precision, Imp SnD, DW Spec, Sword Spec, Weapon Expertise, Blade Flurry, Aggression, Combat Potency, Surprise Attacks, Vitality, and Adrenaline Rush turns out to just be a lot bigger than the damage you can get from the Subtlety talents.</div>

		<div id="post_message_598072">Your gear looks generally okay, although you could use a new chest at some point.  There's certainly better stuff than what you're using, but as I don't know what else you have, it's hard to say whether what you're wearing is right or wrong.<br>
<br>
Talentwise, the most immediate issue I see is that you don't have Improved Sinister Strike.  You should drop 2 points from Lightning Reflexes and get it, as it's one of the best DPS talents there is for a sword rogue.  You're also missing Aggression in combat, which is a definite boost to DPS.  Also, it is typically better to take Lethality than the filler in the lower parts of Combat.  So, if it were me, in addition to getting Imp SS, I'd probably drop Deflection, Riposte, and Fist Spec (as you're not using fists) and spend those 11 points to get Aggression and Lethality.<br>
<br>
For additional details, you can refer to my spec to get an idea of what's more typical for a combat sword rogue.<br>
<br>
However, fundamentally, if you're under 500 on Aran, it's usually not entirely a gear + talent problem.  Typically, it means you're breaking one of the 7 commandments of rogue DPS.  In roughly descending order of importance:<br>
<br>
1) Don't die.<br>
2) Don't do anything that risks wiping the raid.<br>
3) Maximize your time on target<br>
4) Don't let your energy cap out.<br>
5) Don't let SnD drop<br>
6) Use one of the spreadsheets to figure out your best cycle; this will usually be the highest rupture uptime cycle that doesn't violate rule 4 or 5.<br>
7) Use your cooldowns.<br>
<br>
Without having seen you play, I can't comment on whether or not you're doing these.  But if you're not, you should be.</div>

		<div id="post_message_598990">That's an extraordinarily long post you've made to prove that you're an idiot. Your entire math about "only 41 out of 100 swings can crit" is flawed, as you are neglecting the fact that <b>in your own combat table</b>, 1% of all swings will crit whether you have 41% chance to land an attack or 42% chance to land an attack. Adding 1% crit increases the damage of 1% of your attacks by 100%, meaning that no matter how much hit you have, you're adding 100 damage over the course of those 100 swings on average.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">If your total regular hit/crit % is only 41%, that's only 41 out of 75 swings that you can crit.  That means you can only crit, one time, on 54.6% of your crittable swings.  45.3% of the time, after swinging 100 times, you will NOT crit.  So your EXPECTED ADDITIONAL crit damage from adding 1% to crit, when you have just the base 41% to hit, will be 54.6 damage, and after RED's +3%, it will be about 56.23.<br>

And now for the amazing part:  What if you take away that 1% to crit, and instead add 1% to hit?  Remember, because of how Blizzard's attack table works, when you add 1% to hit you must also SUBTRACT 1% to miss (all 4 values must total 100 exactly).   <br>
<br>
Miss:  33%  Glancing:  25%  Crit:  0%  Hit:  42%<br>
<br>
Now you get a full 100 damage added after swinging 100 times, instead of the miniscule 56.23 expected damage added from 1% to crit.  With no gear or buffs, adding +1% hit is almost TWICE as powerful as adding +1% crit.</div>

</div>Incorrect.  You're right that not all swings can hit; what you're missing is that white attacks work on a one-roll system, not a two roll system.  That is, the game doesn't check to see if an attack hits, and then compute whether those 75% of attacks that hit are crits or not; it makes a single roll that is used to check for hits, crits, misses, dodges, parries, glancing... the works.  What does this mean?  It means that gaining 1% crit means an extra 1% of your total attacks - all 100 of them - will crit.  Hence, 1% crit causes 1% of your attacks to do double damage instead of regular damage, while hit causes 1% of your attacks to do regular damage instead of no damage.  Hence, neglecting RED for a moment, <b>1% Crit and 1% Hit have *exactly* the same effect on your white damage</b>.<br>
<br>
However, both crit and hit also have additional effects; crit increase your yellow damage, while white does not; but hit generates extra procs (Poisons, WF, Combat Potency, Mongoose, Dragonspine Trophy, etc.) while crit does not.  Hence, the true value of crit and hit must these more complex interactions into effect; to do so, we usually use spreadsheets, as doing the napkinmath starts to become unmanagably complex.<br>

Vulajin...you seem like a nice guy...sort of...but we've concluded now that the static, unchanging values you've given in the "gear selection" section of your original, thread-starting, supposedly definitive post are utterly worthless.
			
		</td>

	</table>
</div>As noted, we haven't, in fact, established that, but you are to some extent correct that the static values in the initial post aren't universally correct; the value of stats *does* depend on the value of other stats, even if it's not for the reason you cite.  Which is why, just 2 paragraphs above the table, he specifies the gear and buff level that he used to derive this table.  It is not exact for all rogues; however, a little experimentation indicates that it's a reasonable approximation for a wide range of rogues.  For instance, my gear level is significantly above that which is used in the table, so my weightings are a bit different; I have 2.27 EAP per Agi instead of 2.21, 2.53 EAP per hit instead of 2.31, .32 EAP per Armor Pen instead of .29, and so on.  So if I were to use Vulajin's numbers, I'd get a slightly different answer; on the other hand, those numbers are still within 10%, so a lot of the time I'd get an answer that was close to right anyway.<br>
<br>
Fundamentally: it's true that those numbers are not precise for all players.  However, they're a reasonably ballpark value for all but the best and worst geared rogues, and thus are a valuable ballpark figure for those people who want to whip out a quick answer.  And for those that want a more detailed analysis, Vulajin has provided helpful links to the spreadsheets from which they can get them.<br>

				So at some inflection point, for most rogues, they should stop adding hit and start adding crit and attack power only.  I'm not sure what that inflection point is for me, but we can be damn sure it only arrives after one accumulates A LOT of hit.  Tons.  The real pros at Nihilum (that guild whose members are consistently and oh-so-arrogantly derided on these forums) say 290 hit rating or more....sounds plausible.

</div>As has been discussed repeatedly in these forums: playing 60 hours a week when new content comes out does not make you fundamentally more knowledgeable about how to play the class.  Hence, while I give all the respect in the world to Nihilum for it's progression, I don't consider them a credible source for theorycrafting based purely on that fact - and given that these forums focus on theorycraft, we neglect their assertions with good reason when they're wrong.<br>
<br>
Fundamentally, the notion of getting 1 stat up to a given level before starting to stack another is flawed.  Lets say you were at 290 hit, and had the choice of adding 1 hit or 1000 AP.  Which is better?  Well, obviously the AP.  What if you had the choice of adding 50 hit or 1 AP.  Which is better?  Obviously the hit.  My point is that at all levels of gear selection, the absolute value of your current stats is not what you should be basing gear selection on.  Instead, one always should look at what you're giving up and what you're getting in exchange.  Every time I here someone say "I know item X is better, but I'm going to use item Y because I need the hit" I cringe.  If item X is better, it's better, and you should use it!  It may be the case that because of your current stats you have low hit... but if you get more damage from continuing to stack AP and crit, then that's what you should do.  Hit, Crit, AP - these are all just numbers.  What you really want to optomize is DPS; hence, regardless of whether you have 30 hit or 300 hit, you should be selecting the gear that gives the largest possible DPS contribution, regardless of which stats it's coming from.<br>

</div>You're right, it is no better than Shadowpanther.  That's because Shadowpanther uses <b>the same values that Vulajin has posted</b>.  And while these static values are not correct for all rogues, that doesn't make them worthless; they're still a useful tool for making rough approximations of gear quality.  For items of comparable quality you may need a more detailed analysis than it can provide - which is why we have spreadsheets.  But if any rogue, at any gear level compares the T4 helm to the T5 helm to the T6 helm with those numbers, they're going to get the right answer.  So from that perspective, they're not useless.<br>
<br>
I do admit, however, that it might be worth slipping in an extra sentence or two to clarify that these are estimates, and that more exact values can be found from the spreadsheet.<br>
<br>
Regarding the attack table jibe: unless you have discovered something that has eluded the combined efforts of these forums over the past 2+ years (and if you have, please let us know), it is, in fact, you who are unclear on the nature of the attack table; Vulajin is stating the best known results on these topics.<br>

		<div id="post_message_599041">Leebis, did you read much of the rest of the thread? I think you think you understand the attack table's implications, but you really don't... especially since there are about a million factors going in to a DPS increase other than just hit vs. crit. Even assuming the simplist case, Vulajin is right in stating that +1% hit and +1% crit do the same thing for white damage. Using your numbers (which I don't even think are correct for glancings anymore)...<br>
<br>
34% miss/dodge<br>
25% glancing (0.65 multiplier)<br>
0% crit (2.00 multiplier)<br>
41% hit (1.00 multiplier)<br>
<br>
Over 100 hits you do ((25*0.65) + (0*2.00) + (41*1.00))*WeaponDmg = 57.25*WeaponDmg in damage<br>
<br>
Adding 1% hit, you do ((25*0.65) + (0*2.00) + (42*1.00))*WeaponDmg = 58.25*WeaponDmg<br>
<br>
Adding 1% crit, you do ((25*0.65) + (1*2.00) + (40*1.00))*WeaponDmg = 58.25*WeaponDmg<br>
<br>
IE, <b>exactly the same increase</b>.<br>
<br>
Also, percent increase in your DPS is actually <i>more</i> than 1% in both cases:<br>
<br>
(58.25 - 57.25)/57.25 = 0.0175 = 1.75% increase in white damage<br>
<br>
EDIT: Although, he makes a good point in saying that an illustration of the hit table (or a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302181610/http://www.wowwiki.com/Attack_table" target="_blank">link to one</a>) might help new rogues understand what is actually going on when they attack a mob.

1) Don't die.<br>
2) Don't do anything that risks wiping the raid.<br>
3) Maximize your time on target<br>
4) Don't let your energy cap out.<br>

<br>
And that's an extraordinarily short post you've made to prove that when you're challenged you'll resort to petty, personal attacks, rather than respectful rebuttals (see Aldriana's thoughful response above for an example of a respectful rebuttal).  Notice that I haven't insulted you, and you have insulted me.  <br>
<br>
Vulajin said:<br>
Your entire math about "only 41 out of 100 swings can crit" is flawed <br>
Adding 1% crit increases the damage of 1% of your attacks by 100%, meaning that no matter how much hit you have, you're adding 100 damage over the course of those 100 swings on average.<br>
<br>
Wow.  Are you saying that crits cannot miss or be dodged?  If crits cannot miss or be dodged, then you are correct.  If crits CAN miss and be dodged, then I am right.  I've always understood that crits can miss.  In other words, you can miss AND crit at the same time.  But you can't HIT and MISS at the same time. Look at my post again for details (I've tried my best to make it simple, though I fear I have been unable to explain myself in a way that is easy to understand).<br>
<br>
If your crits can miss or be dodged, then your expected damage from 1% crit over 100 swings will not equal 200% until your hit and expertise are capped...when you no longer miss.  Are we debating whether crits can miss?  I hope not.<br>
<br>
Aldriana, sure, you're not Wikipedia.  But EJ has a lot of respect in the wow community.  People believe that you've really done your homework.  So you've got to show that.  Vulajin's post has the appearance of a definitive summary of the choices every rogue needs to make.  And I think he needs more evidence.  The fact that the evidence is scattered across these forums should make it very easy for him to link us to that evidence whenever he makes a debatable claim.</div>

</div>Crits cannot dodge or miss.  A single roll is used to determine both hits and crits.  Hence, if it falls in the "this attack is a critical strike" range of that roll, it is not in the "this attack misses" or "this attack is dodged" range.  We understand what you are trying to argue, and it was a commonly held theory for a time.  But over a year and a half ago it was proven incorrect; as far as anyone has ever been able to tell, it works as Vulajin described.<br>
<br>
<b>Edit</b><br>
Just saw your next post, so let me add this:<br>
<br>
Regarding your point re: spreadsheets.  It's true, they can have mistakes.  As you note, I recently found a bug in the value of expertise in mine.  Are there other bugs in it?  Probably.  But at this point it has been around long enough and subject to review by enough different people that I feel reasonably confident that any remaining bugs are relatively minor.  For instance, the Expertise bug? It was overestimating the value of Expertise by about 10%.  In terms of practical difference - that is, determining the correct ordering of items - this makes precisely no difference whatsoever.  There is no item in the game where the value of Expertise used by the 0.9.1 spreadsheet would given an incorrect value by more than 3 AP - which is under the claimed accuracy of the spreadsheet anyway.  But using those estimates, you would still correctly conclude that the Vashj belt is the best belt in the game, Brooch of Deftness is utterly useless relative to Choker of Vile Intent, Shoulderpads of the Stranger are good for when you can get them, and so on.<br>
<br>
My point?  Yes, the spreadsheets can - and do - have mistakes in them.  However, because they are also the most focused, compact, direct application of theorycrafting around, they're also the most used, meaning that they are likely to be more accurate than anything else.  I am more confident that there are no major bugs in the Rogue Gear Spreadsheet than I am any other piece of code, or estimate, or *anything* else in the game.  To be frank: that's the main reason I made it available to people.  I wrote it for my own use in the beginning, and the primary reason I cleaned it up and released it to these forums was so other people could look at it, try it, and find any mistakes I may have made.  After 6 months of this, I am now reasonably confident that the majority of the mistakes are gone.<br>
<br>
Compare this to pretty much any other calculation available for theorycrafting - say, an alternate source for stat comparisons.  Well, it's either a) much less sophisticated, and thus less accurate for that reason, or b) comparably sophisticated, and thus just as likely to contain bugs.  But if we then have to choose between that program, which is not in wide use, and one of the established spreadsheets, which *is* widely used, which is more likely to have had most of the bugs found and removed?<br>
<br>
So, in the end, is the spreadsheet perfect?  No.  Does it have bugs?  Definitely.  Even if it didn't have bugs, would it be 100% accurate?  Nope.  However, even given these flaws, is it still the best source of numerical theorycrafting available?  Yes.  Flaws or no, it's the best tool we have.  So disparage the numbers from it if you like, but, fundamentally, we don't have any better ones - so the numbers from the spreadsheets are the ones we use.</div>

</div>You are attempting to debate this.. and will lose.  Simply go to any lvl 70 mob and beat away on him for 5+ minutes.  You will note that:<br>
miss = 25 - precision - hitRating/15.77<br>
dodge = ~5<br>
glance = 0 (equal lvl target)<br>
crit = crit shown in character window<br>
hit = whatever is left<br>
<br>
Try it.. really.  Maybe you'll shut up and stop posting information which goes completely 100% against 2 years worth of combat logs from thousands of players.  If it happened to change in patch 2.3.2 and you discovered it - awesome, congrats.  But I doubt it.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Aldriana, sure, you're not Wikipedia.  But EJ has a lot of respect in the wow community.  People believe that you've really done your homework.  So you've got to show that.  Vulajin's post has the appearance of a definitive summary of the choices every rogue needs to make.  And I think he needs more evidence.  The fact that the evidence is scattered across these forums should make it very easy for him to link us to that evidence whenever he makes a debatable claim.</div>

</div>Yes.  He typed something wrong, found out within days, alerted people, and fixed it.  I think they call that a "Development Cycle".  Develop, QA, Bug Fix.  Pretty standard stuff.  If you dig around, you can find posts of people able to match the spreadsheets predicted DPS within 1-2% on fights like Teron and Morogrim.  I'd say its pretty accurate.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Enough of this being polite stuff though.. you are WRONG.  This thread is for a collective set of commonly agreed upon information which has been tested and proven to be correct to the best of our knowledge.  You, with ZERO evidence, are attempting to state "I always thought it was like this though..".  Well news flash, you thought wrong.  If you have questions, I'm sure people would be happy to answer.  If you want to blatantly state random crap as if it were fact, go to the official blizzard WoW forums.  Hell, go look at page 1-2 of the Mutilate thread for an example of someone who posts false information, stated as fact.<br>
<br>
This may be the Elitist Jerks forum, but attempting to act all elitist while being wrong just makes you look like an idiot.  There are plenty of jerks around here who will point that out.  And I for one applaud them.</div>

		<div id="post_message_599717">Copied from wowwiki.com:<br>
<br>
In June of 2005, a Blizzard representative made the following statement: <br>
<br>
"The way WoW calculates crit rate is over ALL attacks. Crit rate is not based on hits only. In other words, if you have a 5% crit rate, that 5% chance includes misses." <br>
<br>
Was the "crits can miss" myth born on this day?    <br>
<br>
Vulajin...my MATH wasn't flawed enough to produce a wrong theory.  My assumption that "crits can miss" was flawed.  What was also flawed was your ability to figure out exactly how had missed the mark.  If crits can miss, then just about everything I said is true.  But crits CAN'T miss (I always thought it was a nonsensical idea that one could miss a critical strike, but when I first started playing the game, that's what I read and so I believed it.  I think the fact that people miss CB evis all the time added to the confusion.)  <br>
<br>
I'll say it again for the new players reading this thread and looking for the facts:  A MISS AND CRIT CAN'T HAPPEN AT THE SAME TIME.  <br>
<br>
You can call me an idiot if you like, but the real idiot is the Blizzard rep quoted above.  <br>
<br>
I still contend that:<br>
1)  Vulajin needs more citations.<br>
2)  The Gear Selection section needs an overhaul.<br>
3)  An attack table with an explanation is needed (or a link to one).<br>
4)  Perhaps a "myths and realities" section would be a nice addition.  There is A LOT of misinformation out there, things like "there's always a 1% chance to miss!", "mutilate is better", and my favorite, "crits can miss".</div>

</div>No, you're the idiot.  Read exactly what he said.  Crits are calculated over ALL attacks. That means the listed crit rate is your crit rate among ALL attacks.  If you hit 80% of the time and have a 25% crit rate, that means you'll have 55 normal hits and 25 crits, NOT that you'll get 60 hits and 20 crits.  You are reading what he said incorrectly and calling him an idiot.</div>

Hemo should be doing less damage in 2.3.2 than in 2.3.0.<br>

Hemorrhage is also normalized based on weapon type and speed so the amount of damage you do with an individual attack will vary depending on the type and speed of the weapon you are using and can not be directly compared to your main hand attacks.<br>

		<div id="post_message_600136">In June of 2005, a Blizzard representative made the following statement: <br>
<br>
"The way WoW calculates crit rate is over ALL attacks. Crit rate is not based on hits only. In other words, if you have a 5% crit rate, that 5% chance includes misses." <br>
<br>
Balkoth said:<br>
No, you're the idiot. Read exactly what he said. That means the listed crit rate is your crit rate among ALL attacks. If you hit 80% of the time and have a 25% crit rate, that means you'll have 55 normal hits and 25 crits, NOT that you'll get 60 hits and 20 crits.<br>
<br>
What's idiotic of you is to assume that everyone who reads the Blizzard rep's quote would and should draw exactly the conclusion that you have tried to articulate.  A better way to look at it:  A Blizzard rep expressed himself poorly/irresponsilbly/lazily (choose one) one day, spawning a myth (crits can miss) that brought on a whole lot of unnecessary confusion.  It's likely that, if you didn't know what you know now, you would have drawn the same conclusion from his quote. But with the benefit of some extra knowledge gained from extensive testing, you can now interperet it in an alternative way...and thereby try to convince everyone that you're brighter than everyone else.  When in fact, you've just proved that you're not...and that you're probably very insecure.</div>

		<div id="post_message_600160">Um, actually, I think that the Blizzard quote says pretty clearly that crit chance is out of all attacks, not out of all hits, meaning that crits can't hit.  But even assuming for the moment that it is ambiguous and/or wrong, it certainly wouldn't be the first time that a blue post was wrong about such matters (see: the notorious weapon skill quote), nor would it be the first time that Wowwiki had improper information posted. Which is why the purpose of these forums is not to blindly regurgitate blue posts; it's to test and find out what actually happens.  Personally, I put roughly no stock whatsoever in anything quoted from an outside source - Blizzard or not - until it's been tested.  Hence, quoting blue posts around here will get you nowhere in terms of convincing people that you're write (or not) unless you have evidence backing up your claims - which you don't, because you're wrong.<br>
<br>
Also, I'd like to point out that just because someone disagrees with you or has a different opinion, doesn't meant they are "idiotic" or "insecure" - it means that they have a different opinion.  So it would be appreciated by all here present if you could put forward your theories without being tremendously insulting about it.  The reason why people have been dismissive and somewhat rude towards you is that you've been dismissive and somewhat rude to them, with the added disadvantage of also being wrong.</div>

		<div id="post_message_600164">In context, that statement is completly unabiguous.  At the time, DamageMeters/Recap calcuated crit as a percetage of hits, instead of swings.  As a result, people were seeing significantly higher crits rates than expected.  Far from spawning the myth that crits can miss, that post is what first told us that they can't, and until then it was assumed that all attacks were two (or possibly even more) rolls.  The fact that it could be misunderstood now is somewhat irrelevant, as assuming that anything from over two years ago is accurate is incredibly foolish with how much the game mechanics have changed.</div>

Testing here has shown that white attacks use a 1-roll system.  That's better than any amount of blue posts to me.</div>

		<div id="post_message_600338">So...back to the poisons for a moment.  If I interpreted your results correctly, the average value of Deadly Poison is a four stack because when it falls off, it takes a bit to restack.  You also said that Improved Poisons was likely to be better than Vile Poisons for a movement oriented fight.  Looking at t4 and beyond content, let's see what fights rogues need to stop DPSing on regularly and which make it likely for a stack to fall off<br>
<br>
<u>Karazhan</u><br>
Moroes: Vanish<br>
Wizard of Oz: Different mobs to kill<br>
Illhoof: Sacrifices and the little imp (assuming you kill it)<br>
Prince: Enfeeble<br>
Nightbane: Air Phases<br>
<br>
<u>Gruul's Lair</u><br>
High King: Different adds, Maulgar's Whirlwind<br>
Gruul: Ground Slam<br>
<br>
<u>Magtheridon's Lair</u><br>
Magtheridon: Different Channelers, Earthquake<br>
<br>
<u>Serpentshrine Cavern</u><br>
Lurker: Submerges<br>
Leotheras: Whirlwinds, phase shifts, inner demons<br>
Fathom Lord: Different adds<br>
<br>
<u>Tempest Keep</u><br>
Al'ar: Meteors (Dive Bombs)<br>
Solarian: Phase changes<br>
Kael'Thas: A bunch early on and Gravity Lapse.  Also, can poison be applied through his force shield?<br>
<br>
<u>Hyjal Summit</u><br>
Azgalor: Rain of Fire<br>
Archimonde: Doomfire, Fear, and Air Burst<br>
<br>
<u>Black Temple</u><br>
Supremus: Phase 2 (aka melee only get 1 minute of DPS typically every 2 minutes)<br>
Shade of Akama: Different Channelers, less than 1 minute to kill the shade<br>
<br>
The rest seem to be fairly melee friendly in terms of extended periods of DPS when poison procs matter.  However, would the fairly large number of fights where this occurs make Improved Poisons better in general?  And if so, can the talent builds in the first post be updated appropriately?</div>

		<div id="post_message_600475">Well, lets look at IP versus VP for a moment.  Note that this is rather dependent on gear (and in particular, the speed of your OH) - but for me (255 hit, 16 expertise, 1.4 speed OH, 58 haste rating, faster SnD from 2/5 T6), this is what I get:<br>
<br>
DPS with no poison talents: 1574.13<br>
DPS with one point of IP: 1575.83<br>
DPS with one point of VP: 1576.9<br>
<br>
So a point in Improved Poisons gives 1.7 DPS, and a point in Vile Poisons gives 2.77 DPS.  So, for me, on sustained fights, Vile Poison is clearly superior.<br>
<br>
So, the next question is: how often must interruptions occur before Vile catches up?  Well, I showed in my last poison post that the average time to stack up from 0 to full is 5/p seconds, during which time you 40% of your usual damage ( as (0+1+2+3+4)/5 = 2)  Hence, each forced interruption (such as shatter) costs you about 3/p second-stacks of poison.  For my gear with no Imp Poisons, p = .2508; with 1/5 Imp Poisons, it's .2676.  Hence, damage loss for 1/5 Imp Poisons is 15 * 3/.2676 = 168.2 damage; for 1/5 Vile Poisons, it's 186.6 dmage.  Hence, each interruption favors IP by 18.4 damage; since VP usually does an extra 1.07 sustained damage, it then follows that we must have an interruption at least once every 16.3 seconds in order for IP to catch up.  In terms of raid fights where this happens, we have... Leo during human phase (but not demon phase)... and that's about it.  So on the whole, for me, I would say Vile Poisons is basically always better.<br>
<br>
Now, the key thing here is that a lot of rogues are using 1.5 speed OHs, don't have 2/5 T6 for faster SnD, may not have 58 haste rating on OH, etc.  So with the lower poison application of such a rogue, it is very likely possible to have this gap get up into the range where you start hitting fights like Al'ar; I ran the numbers with a 1.5 speed OH, no Haste, and no 2/5 T6 and found the crossover time to be 57 seconds.   But I suspect fights like FLK - where you're spending 1-2 minute on every target - will always favor VP.<br>
<br>
Now, on trash, you probably do get down into the range where IP catches up; and while in general I think it makes more sense to optomize around boss DPS, Hyjal is annoying enough that I could see wanting to improve your trash DPS for it.  Hence, there is perhaps some small case to be made around IP for that reason, although even then time on target tends to be 30 seconds or more.<br>
<br>
The last consideration, of course, is that there are some fights where one or more rogues needs to use Wound or Mind-Numbing poisons (Magtheridon channelers, for instance; or, in T6 content, Anetheron, Reliquary, Council, and Illidan).  For these, IP is clearly superior; hence, if you wind up on poison duty a lot, that could also skew things.<br>
<br>
But, as a general rule, I suspect that the number of fights that have enough interruptions that IP catches up to VP is small enough that I would still recommend VP for most rogues; for instance, even if you are in the 57-second crossover case, which is arguably enough to get all 4 of the T6 fights you mention... that's still 4 fights out of 14.  Even including the MN/Wound fights, we're still only at about half the fights in T6. So I guess my feeling is that the general recommendation should be to stick with Vile, with perhaps a note indicating the circumstances under which one might consider Vile instead (slow OH, few haste effects, etc.).</div>

		<div id="post_message_601758">OK - I've been thinking some about the blood elf racial ability, or rather abilities: Mana Tap and Arcane Torrent. I will be referring to these as MT and AT throughout this post. <br>
<br>
First of all, after talking to the other rogues in my guild, I found out one of them didn't even know about MT and was only familiar with AT, where as the other two thought MT was useless cause they assumed it returned only mana and thus was useless to a rogue. So, I shall begin by clarifying exactly what, for a rogue, these skills do:<br>
<br>
Mana Tap (MT): 30yd Range, Instant, 30 Second CD - Reduces target's mana by 120 and charges you with Arcane energy for 10 min. This effect stacks up to 3 times.<br>
<br>
Arcane Torrent (AT): Instant, 2 Min CD - Silence all enemies within 8 yards for 2 sec. <b>In addition, you gain 10 Energy for each Mana Tap charge currently affecting you.</b><br>
<br>
Note: The last part is in bold as this is the general focus of my post. <br>
<br>
Essentially, versus mobs with mana (as MT does not work versus mobs with no mana), by fully utilising these abilities as often as possible you stand to gain 30 Energy per 2 minutes. Obviously at first this doesn't sound like very much and it isn't, but since this thread is pretty much all about min/maxing I figured any dps gain (assuming it is a dps gain) is worth it in most circumstances. <br>
<br>
To determine exactly how much dps you gain from doing this, using as simple numbers as possible, I envisaged a roughly 10 minute fight. Given the 30 second cooldown of MT, it will take 90 seconds just to get the full stack (assuming no resists, I'll get to this later) meaning in a 10 minute fight it's likely you will get the opportunity to use 4 fully stacked AT's for a return of 120 energy, or 3 Sinister strikes. Using my own average hits (1000+ non crit, 2200+ crit) and a base crit chance of 33% for simplicity, this equates to roughly 4.2k damage over the course of the 10 minutes, or as far as I can work out about 7dps. Forgive me if my numbers are totally off, it's late here in Europe. <br>
<br>
So my first question to you guys is whether in your opinions 7dps is worth looking into this further?<br>
<br>
There's definitely a lot more to this than meets the eye though. One thing that makes me think this is useless is that I'm fairly sure both abilities count as arcane damage and thus would use spell hit to determine resists, and I would assume boss level mobs therefore to resist a lot of both the mana tap's and arcane torrents making it all rather pointless. <br>
<br>
I also thought in regards to how it could be worth a lot more than 7dps if it works at least somewhat consistently and is used in the right circumstances. Many boss fights force you out of combat for various lengths of time and this can really screw up your cycle if your energy caps out. If you had 3 MT charges when you run back in you can squeeze in 5 combo points in at least 2 seconds less by using AT at the right time. Or if Ruthlessness/Relentless strikes doesn't proc it could save your snd from dropping off for a second or two if your cycle is really tight. <br>
<br>
As I said there's obviously more to using these skills than it would first seem, and I haven't really seen it discussed much, at least from a rogue's POV before so I figured I'd look into it. Do any of you have any opinions or experience testing this?</div>

		<div id="post_message_601770">To be honest, I usually just pretty much forget Blood Elf rogues exist (who wouldn't), so I've never actually looked at the ability in too much detail. That said, since it's essentially similar in nature to Adrenaline Rush, let's compare it directly to that: 30 energy every 2 minutes versus 150 energy every 5 minutes; or 15 energy per minute versus 30 energy per minute. Thus, Arcane Torrent is essentially half an Adrenaline Rush.<br>
<br>
Of course, there's slightly more to it than that. The way Adrenaline Rush is usually used allows you to get an entire extra finisher sequence within your cycle (for most sword builds, you can manage 5e pretty safely during an AR without Slice dropping, particularly if you synchronize it with other cooldowns). Arcane Torrent will let you get maybe a free Sinister Strike, saving you in a circumstance where maybe you didn't get Ruthlessness procs and you're going to lose your Slice without it. So it's a different benefit, but it's actually slightly more valuable in its own way. I'd say rating it as half of Adrenaline Rush is pretty fair.<br>
<br>
The real question is, what bosses actually have mana and aren't immune to Mana Tap? I don't usually pay attention to this, so hopefully some Blood Elf rogue can help us out with a list of mana-having bosses here.<br>
<br>
(edit) Quick note, yeah, you'll probably have a lot of Mana Tap resists. However, Arcane Torrent resists don't matter (and most bosses will be immune anyway), because the energy is restored regardless of the silence effect.</div>

		<div id="post_message_601794">It might be noted that as of 0.9, the Rogue Gear Spreadsheet actually does model all horde racials, including Mana Tap, and under the assumption that you can get a fully charged AT every 2 minutes against most bosses, it is arguably the best horde racial; the troll racial is better on fights where you regularly take damage and can thus get more than a 10% speed increase, the orc racial is better on fights where you don't take much damage so can use it without fear of the healing buff, and the UD racial is better on fights where you get feared/otherwise disabled.  But as a general rule, I think the BE racial is perhaps the most broadly applicable, and is basically a close second even under the best possible scenarios for each of the other classes.  Thus, there is a real case to be made that BE is the *best* race to play as a PvE horde rogue.<br>
<br>
That said: the differences we're looking at are on the order of half of a percent, so if you PvP at all you'll probably be happier as UD, and regardless of that fact there's not a lot of motivation not to just pick your favorite class.  But if you are truly optimizing for PvE from level 1, there is a very strong argument that BE is the way to go.</div>

		<div id="post_message_601796">Heh, I admit there aren't too many of us, especially in the endgame as we're generally overshadowed by all our paladin brothers/sisters so I can't really blame you for forgetting we exist.<br>
<br>
In regards to which bosses actually have mana and are succeptible to mana tap, that's a very good question. I only really started thinking about this tonight and we already cleared BT, MH and even TK this week to attune a new trial so I doubt I'll have a chance to test any of this for real until wednesday (instances reset on wednesday in EU, I think it's tuesday on US realms if I'm not mistaken, so any american belf's out there that could lend a hand with some preliminary tests?).<br>
<br>
Another thing that was on my mind would be how to make sure you use mana tap as efficiently i.e. as often as possible and my initial instinct was to try and weave it into a SS macro. Since any sort of castsequence macro seems to get stuck on mana tap if your trying to use it on someone without mana or if it's on CD, the only way I could think of doing it was by using a castrandom macro, which basically results in a lot of "error noises" (not the speech) which is kind of irritating though I guess I could live with it if there's no better way. <br>
<br>
I'd be the first to admit that I'm not great with macros, can anyone think of a way to do this other than what I've already suggested?<br>
<br>
EDIT: I was personally very skeptical as to whether I was on to something here or if it was a total waste of time, now that two people (Aldriana, Vulajin) whom I respect a great deal on these forums have suggested that I may be on to something I feel much more inclined to test this, so thank you for the motivation :&gt;</div>

		<div id="post_message_601848">After alot of thought and minor calculations (math ain't really my thing...) I decided to try out 0/20/41 for raid purposes. I focused my efforts on getting alot of AP and hit rating (with food buff I'm at 344 hit rating, fully buffed (no warrior shout) I was around 2.6k AP) to maximize my white dps and my rupture DPS... I made my circles: 1cp SnD - 5cp Rupture - 2cp SnD - 5cp Rupture and so on.<br>

For example, on Kael'Thas my ruptures did 5464 dmg... I dont know if anyone ever could say that their eviscerate standards at 5.5k... =)<br>

I didnt really capture any WWS or something like that, I just wanted to make a footnote here that the statement that shadowstep would produce 12% less dps than combat swords in average is quite wrong.</div>

</div>Then, quite frankly, please don't post here.  You're losing 5% crit, sword spec, Blade Flurry, 10 expertise, Relentless Strikes, Ruthlessness, Aggression, 16%ish Sinister Strike damage, and Combat Potency.  In return, you get Hemo, 10% attack power, 15% agility, and 20% more damage on one Rupture per 30 seconds.<br>
<br>
The people here have done the math and calculated the various cycles.  They've spent hours determining proc rates and values of talents.  For you to come here and claim (without any math beyond a rupture damage) that you know better...<br>
<br>
P.S. Combat has two cooldowns for DPS: Adrenaline Rush and Blade Flurry.  However, as Sub you're using a cooldown for DPS as well: Shadowstep.<br>
<br>
P.P.S. I don't see your point about Eviscerates.<br>
<br>
P.P.P.S. Being "very close" to your previous DPS doesn't mean much.  Many people would saying being within 12% DPS would be "very close," but obviously you think otherwise.</div>

	</table>
</div>I admit I never thought of the fact that Arcane Torrent resists are irrelevant, this means obviously you only have to worry about Mana Tap. Given that MT has a 30 second cooldown and AT has 2 minutes, you should always be able to fit in 4 MT's per AT. I also admit I've never played a caster class so spell hit and the average spell resist of a boss mob is beyond me, all I know is that with spells there is always a minimum 1% resist chance - but I would find it hard to believe that the typical resist rate with no spell hit is anywhere in the region of 25%, so <i>on average</i> you should be able to get your 3 charges while still using AT every cooldown. Hopefully then, the resist side of this is negligent, meaning the biggest factor now is probably what percentage of bosses you can actually use this on.<br>

The reason behind not letting your energy go to 0 may be contextual.

</div>Well, it's really funny how alot of people seem to rely alot on Theorycrafting these days. Alot of the time the smallest changes in performance start the biggest arguments, having people test and test in theorycrafting etc. You write in different values into some sheet and see how that calculates your DPS output. Could you honestly say that that is reliable? I highly doubt that for alot of reasons... Mainly, even though WOW is a game built on fixed rules, it has a big "chance" to fail you all the time. Even if you say that something has a certain amount of procc-rate it wont help you with shit unless it actually does procc, what good is combat potency if you're at 100% energy? What good is an extra hit with the sword if your target parries it? What good is it to come down on someone who's just posting his personal observations on a public forum, when all you do is calculate it on a sheet?<br>
<br>
All I said was that from testing it (well, ACTUALLY testing it), I found out that shadowstep can do at least as good as a sword combat specc in raids (given that the mob can bleed). <br>
You said I'd have the 30 sec CD from shadowstep to worry about? You obviously didnt read what I said: I circled 2SnD 5Rupture, meaning I have the 5 CPs for rupture every 30 seconds, meaning I never have to wait for a CD. I get to plan out my cycles exactly, without having to redo it if I get alot of potency proccs or something like that, the DPS becomes more stable. <br>
<br>
You can sit and say that some people spent alot of time calculating how the dps would differ depending on different speccs etc (and, sure, it does have alot of value in calculating), but what good would these calculations do in a raid compared to personal experience and know-how? <br>
<br>
IMHO, putting a label on different speccs to do "about 12% less dps" is just a tad naïve. In the end it comes down to the person behind the rogue, and not the rogue's specc. <br>
<br>
For example, you complained about not having crit rating in a raid specc. Why? Critting is getting more dmg for that hit, but I'd gladly change the amount of AP I gained for that 5% crit any day. I gain 15% agility from this specc, too, meaning (with my current gear) I gain about 80 agility, which would give me 2%crit and 80 AP. Would any raid-oriented rogue actually rather take 3% crit over 80ap? I sure wouldnt. Crit doesnt do anything for your proccs, for your rupture dps or for your CP building (except if you raid with Seal Fate). Unbuffed I had about 2k ap, 21% crit and 324 hit rating (hardly above t4 gear), this, in my eyes, is alot better than the 1750 ap and 24% crit I'd have otherwise. <br>
<br>
Kings improves your stats by 10%, having more agility boosts the bonus from kings. Improving your AP alot gives and insane dps to your rupture (which you only apply each 18 second, and, with the time you need to get up CPs for SnD, I wouldnt ask to gain CPs any faster than I am.). <br>
<br>
In short, you complain about me not making any research for my statements? I did alot of research, mind you, but I didnt waste hour after hour putting it down in a sheet when I could spend my time doing better and more useful things. <br>
You always need proof before you test something? <br>
<br>
It was just a footnote, as I said. No need to come down on me for not using a sheet which, obviously, doesnt do the job in the end.</div>

	</table>
</div>I never said that this would be something anyone else had to try out. I never stated that I had any theorcrafting evidence to back me up, but instead I saw the result in a real raid instead of imagining it on a sheet. Why do you state that I need data to back something up when I'm not making an offensive statement? I've tried something out, and now I gave my opinion about it and also made a notice about something on this forum that I think is incorrect. To say that I would have 12% less dps as shadowstep in comparassion to a combat sword-rogue is not only decieving, it's alot very unclear. <br>
<br>
There are alot of things that could go wrong in a raid; The target is not always stable, you're not always able to hit it, it could be immune to poison/bleed, it could debuff you making your do less dps, etc etc... Just making statements like this, and not allowing others to make their own unless they do it by your standards, is just ignorant. Communism works on paper too, I'd think that alot of people would say that the actual thing aint the same. <br>
<br>
You can calculate alot on these papers, but you fail to interact it with the human factor and, quite honestly, that's the biggest difference you'll ever find between players. <br>
<br>
If you're wondering about me "feeling" better with this specc, what's so wrong about that? I saw that my DPS was solid, as high as it usually is, and it went without mistakes. With a sword combat specc there are alot of things that can go wrong, if you put a piece of your dps on your AR you'd also lose alot of dps if you'd get imobilized, feared, stunned or something like that whilest you have your AR up. <br>
<br>
Theorycrafting is good in itself, but you cant rely 100% on it when you want to actually raid yourself. For instance: When looking up the ZA swords and comparing them to MG swords I came up with the result that the ZA swords would be "worth" more and cause higher dps than the MG ones. When I tried it out, guess what? It didnt fall through. <br>
These numbers are all still put together by some people, meaning that these people can make mistakes filling in these numbers. I dont care how carefully you calculate, it's not gonna be as accurate as you may think. Testing it over and over again is the best way to actually see any difference between different gear and / or specc.</div>

In one case I was watching a friend farm in EPL while waiting to get into Naxx, and he had SCT reporting his normal energy gains.  They were consistently 21-22.  I also remember from playing my own druid with energy numbers displayed that sometimes I would get more than 20 energy in a tick.<br>
<br>
In both of these cases, I attributed it to the server being overloaded.  You are supposed to regenerate 10 energy per second.  My theory was that if the server couldn't keep up with having a regen tick every 2 seconds and was having to delay them, it would still credit you with the appropriate amount of energy if it took 2.1 or 2.2 seconds.  Given that I tended to experience the above behavior when the server felt a little more sluggish than normal, and really having no other way to interpret what I saw, I was fairly sure it was a reasonable explanation.  And I forgot all about it until I read the last few posts.</div>

</div>Yes.  Testing it over and over is the best way, providing you capture data to ojectively measure your performance and allow for peer review.<br>

Testing it once, then posting about it without providing any data, especially when it contradicts current best thinking which did spring from data... well, that's just not something we have any interest in wasting time even reading, sorry.</div>

</div>Yep, let me introduce you to a concept called regression. Maybe you won't see the immediate effects of changing out an AP gem to a Hit gem, or speccing from Combat to some crappy Shadowstep Hemo variant, but a spreadsheet can tell you the differences in an environment unlimited by time and chance. <br>

</div>Because your personal observations are based on the very thing you used to try to refute our use of the spreadsheets: chance. Maybe you had good luck with Shadowstep, and that's fine.

Odds are if you did, we'd be able to point out why you're seeing such similar results between the two specs. <br>

</div>Playstyle is important, no argument here. Gear is only a part of a rogue's potential. Knowledge of proper DPS cycles, gemming, and speccing are also very important. But that's not your "humble" opinion, that's just common sense.<br>

For the shadowstep vs combat sword: I didnt try it once, I doubt that I would have been more lucky just because I specced shadowstep than when I was specced combat swords, why would I have been? <br>
<br>
In regards to collecting data, all DMs and WWS showed the difference, what more data is needed?<br>
<br>
I said it was only a footnote, it's not supposed to be taken as serious in regards to spreadsheets as previous posts since my observations have been from actual raiding and no theorycrafting (as I've said all the time.). Why are you getting so worked up? I'm stating my observations in order to contradict previous posts regarding shadowstep; If this forum's supposed to help people, I'm here to say that you can do good dps in more than one way. Why be so stuck up on just moving forward along one line when you can explore different possibilities? Here I did so. I wrote what I noticed and then you get insulted by that?<br>
<br>
This is not supposed to be a monolog, it's supposed to be a debatorial forum, right? If one guy states that shadowstep would do 12% less dps than another, does that have to be true? <br>
<br>
If you want to contradict that the spreadsheet shows this or that: I never mentioned anything about spreadsheet results, I stated what my actual raid dps turned out to show from the speccs. <br>
<br>
I thought it'd be quite clear what buffs I'd have if I said I was "raid-buffed without warrior shout", but it's true that that depends on what classes are in my party etc... In my party I (in almost all cases) have enh shaman, warrior, paladin and druid to accompany me. Incidently, in most raids with shadowstep specc I seem to be missing druid in my party though. <br>
Fully raid-buffed includes (dps-increasing buffs); Blessing of Might, Blessing of Kings, MotW, +20 hit-rating food and Flask or Relentless Assault (+120ap) with Deadly Poison on my offhand (WF totem applying to mainhand). When I'm in party with a druid I'd of course also have their leader of the pack buff.<br>
<br>
<br>
If you are protective of your results from spreadsheets etc, that's fine. I'm not saying that your spreadsheets would show that what I'm saying is accurate, but this is what happens in the game, which is the whole points of this. <br>
My white DPS increased (going from aprox 600 to above 700 dps) and my rupture increased alot in dmg (which is the only finishing move except for SnD that I use).<br>
<br>
This is so far what I've noticed from playing around with different speccs. When I decided how to specc I simply tried some things out, and these are my conclusions.<br>
<br>
I'm sorry that I wont spend hour after hour on providing proof for you guys. I'm not writing here to prove anyone wrong, I'm simply adding my point of view.<br>
<br>
What I'm wondering is why anyone would be questioning my personal observations at all. <br>
I like playing as the underdog, so I have something to chase. With shadowstep alot of people said I'd have trouble keeping up with the dps, and, sure I had trouble considering that rogues with BF would be able to go double dps for 15 seconds every 2 min. I'll keep trying this specc out, tweaking my strategies a bit, and post back with some WWS for "backup". <br>
<br>
My overall conclusion so far has been that shadowstep is fun (kinda important to me...^^) and definitely reliable in raids.<br>

Why post in a theorycrafting forum if you're not providing any or asking for any?   Since you're unable/refuse to provide any proof to back your statements up, it's been a bunch of pointless posts.    We got no idea on your performance as a combat rogue (for all we know could just suck there), no idea how you actually performed as a shadowstep rogue, no idea on the un/lucky streaks you may have obtained, nor any of the buffs that were up (even your buff list was vague, may or may not have a feral druid).     Anyways, seems like you wanted a footnote, so from our point of view it'd be like "One shadowstep rogue supposedly managed to come close to his own combat spec a few times in dps".

If you could also provide your specific gear sets for each WWS then we could plug it all into the sheet and evaluate our models.

I didnt mean to critizise the work that's been put into theorycrafting (I have read these forums alot myself and taken advice from here). I wanted to show what I noticed while raiding with shadowstep because it made me think, at least. I've always thought of shadowstep kinda like it's written here on the forums, but then I decided to try it out for a change and found it to be alot better than I thought... I tested and tried around for quite some time, and noticed that the increase in dps that I finally saw was alot different from what I've heard and read before regarding shadowstep; I think it needs to be looked at again. <br>
<br>
I'll be collecting WWS etc for future data, but it will take some time since I can only raid a few times per week. <br>
<br>
AFAIK, the stats on shadowstep, as it's written on the first post in this thread, is quite outdated (I remember reading those details a few months back) so one of the reasons for me to post here would be to update the info about shadowstep and the possibilities for raiding.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Once again you guys seem to be totally missing the point. <br>
<br>
For the shadowstep vs combat sword: I didnt try it once, I doubt that I would have been more lucky just because I specced shadowstep than when I was specced combat swords, why would I have been? <br>
<br>
In regards to collecting data, all DMs and WWS showed the difference, what more data is needed?<br>
<br>
I said it was only a footnote, it's not supposed to be taken as serious in regards to spreadsheets as previous posts since my observations have been from actual raiding and no theorycrafting (as I've said all the time.). Why are you getting so worked up? I'm stating my observations in order to contradict previous posts regarding shadowstep; If this forum's supposed to help people, I'm here to say that you can do good dps in more than one way. Why be so stuck up on just moving forward along one line when you can explore different possibilities? Here I did so. I wrote what I noticed and then you get insulted by that?<br>
<br>
This is not supposed to be a monolog, it's supposed to be a debatorial forum, right? If one guy states that shadowstep would do 12% less dps than another, does that have to be true? <br>
<br>
If you want to contradict that the spreadsheet shows this or that: I never mentioned anything about spreadsheet results, I stated what my actual raid dps turned out to show from the speccs. <br>
<br>
I thought it'd be quite clear what buffs I'd have if I said I was "raid-buffed without warrior shout", but it's true that that depends on what classes are in my party etc... In my party I (in almost all cases) have enh shaman, warrior, paladin and druid to accompany me. Incidently, in most raids with shadowstep specc I seem to be missing druid in my party though. <br>
Fully raid-buffed includes (dps-increasing buffs); Blessing of Might, Blessing of Kings, MotW, +20 hit-rating food and Flask or Relentless Assault (+120ap) with Deadly Poison on my offhand (WF totem applying to mainhand). When I'm in party with a druid I'd of course also have their leader of the pack buff.<br>
<br>
<br>
If you are protective of your results from spreadsheets etc, that's fine. I'm not saying that your spreadsheets would show that what I'm saying is accurate, but this is what happens in the game, which is the whole points of this. <br>
My white DPS increased (going from aprox 600 to above 700 dps) and my rupture increased alot in dmg (which is the only finishing move except for SnD that I use).<br>
<br>
This is so far what I've noticed from playing around with different speccs. When I decided how to specc I simply tried some things out, and these are my conclusions.<br>
<br>
I'm sorry that I wont spend hour after hour on providing proof for you guys. I'm not writing here to prove anyone wrong, I'm simply adding my point of view.<br>
<br>
What I'm wondering is why anyone would be questioning my personal observations at all. <br>
I like playing as the underdog, so I have something to chase. With shadowstep alot of people said I'd have trouble keeping up with the dps, and, sure I had trouble considering that rogues with BF would be able to go double dps for 15 seconds every 2 min. I'll keep trying this specc out, tweaking my strategies a bit, and post back with some WWS for "backup". <br>
<br>
My overall conclusion so far has been that shadowstep is fun (kinda important to me...^^) and definitely reliable in raids.<br>
<br>
TBC.<br>
<br>
P.S. Personal insults? What makes you think I'd even care?</div>

</div>Your point as I see it is that your personal experience and wholly unreliable opinion should trump or prove a flaw in the mathematically proved and fundamentally sound spreadsheets designed to model real-average DPS of specific gear and talents.<br>
<br>
In regards to your failure to display the collected data, stop opinionating (and that means don't reply to this post) UNTIL you have displayed this data for the scrupulous analysis of more knowledgable and seasoned raiders.<br>
<br>
Theory<b>crafting</b> is just another word for science applied to a game that so happens to be called World of War<b>craft</b>. Though, it is true that theories are meant to be proven wrong in some cases, people here do it with confidence because math is infallible even if it only accounts for averages (humans, however, are, which causes the problems with spreadsheets in the end).<br>
<br>
This hasn't been a monologue either. Read the many posts in reply to yours. That's a debate.<br>
<br>
It may not have to be true, but it should be disproved in the same way it was proved in the first place (i.e. hard numbers).<br>
<br>
This is not what happens in the game. This is what happened for you. Something is different for you (whether it be that you did something wrong or we need more data) because the numbers have been tried, and nothing can change that.<br>
<br>
Your point of view doesn't help anyone or anything. What would help is if you <b>were</b> trying to disprove something, and you <b>are</b>. However, you seem to refuse to go about it in the proper manner.<br>
<br>
Nobody questions what you saw. We just question how you saw it because we want to see it too. If you missed something, perhaps we can show that to you. Then, you can go on your merry way doing more damage than before. Maybe you might even disprove something. I'm not saying it isn't possible, but that so far, what you have posted, doesn't change a thing.<br>
<br>
<b>Edit:</b> Most of this post is redundant after reading one of bamse's replies I missed and Left's reply. I apologize for that.</div>

				It should be noted that if the build you're using isn't linked in the first post, it is because it is not that good for PVE dps. I admit that it is possible that we've overlooked a build with synergy that we haven't accounted for, but if that's the case, please provide a WWS of you using such a build, doing great sustained DPS (for this purpose, I'd say &gt; 1k DPS as fully T4 geared, &gt; 1500 DPS fully T5 geared, or &gt; 2000 DPS fully T6 geared), and if we find the results reproducable in the context of the current endgame (i.e. not a 1 trick pony for just one fight), I promise you we'll include it and study it further.

</div>Please stop posting crap about this build unless it includes the above WWSes.   It's not doing anyone any good to talk about it otherwise.  At your guild's progression level (early T6), you should easily be able to show me a 1600 DPS+ WWS if it's a competitve build.   Do that and we'll start talking.  Here's a 0 grave Morogrim kill for me as combat with realistically all the right buffs except CoR and Imp FF, hitting 1555 DPS:<br>

Edit to add: I'm guessing on your gear, since you logged in your PvP gear.  But seriously, you're giving us hell for not evaluating something and not taking you seriously WHEN YOU GIVE US NO REASON TO DO SO.   Information.  Make with more of it.  It's not like most of us haven't spec'd Shadowstep for shits and giggles on a vacation week or for a farm night or something.   We've seen it do less DPS.  I fully admit we may be missing something, but it cannot be figured out by people coming here and saying "I feel like this is better".</div>

</div>To be fair: there has actually quite a bit of examination of Shadowstep lately.  The last few pages of the now-locked (and with good reason) Combat vs Hemo thread were primarily about Shadowstep, and less than a week ago in this very thread there was further analysis of it (see posts 893-895).  So it's not really accurate to say no one has put any thought into it lately, because we have, and concluded that it's clearly inferior for stationary fights, and while there is some survivability and movement gained from it, most people seem to think that these advantages are insufficient to offset the loss of DPS.<br>
<br>
As for collecting data on the matter: the problem is that there's just so much variance on Rogue DPS in practical situations.  Even neglecting the issue of actual randomness in your rolls against the mob - lucky crit strings and whatever (which is a considerable source of variance), the fact that every fight is a little different, the positioning is a little different, the debuffs the boss passes out can be a little different, your gear can be a little different... basically, in order to get any truly statistical significant information out of WWS parses, you need to have literally dozens of parses with the same rogue in the same gear doing the same fights with each of the two different specs.  Anything you can gather in a couple weeks - or even a couple of months - really just isn't that conclusive, and falls more under the category of "anecdotal evidence" rather than "proof".<br>
<br>
So, fundamentally: if you enjoy SS and want to play it?  Fine.  But without some actual numbers - either statistical analysis, large-scale simulations, or a selection of WWS parses on a scale no one has yet attempted - you really don't have the evidence to say that it's better than asserted in the beginning of the thread.  It has been analyzed by many of the top theorycrafters, weighed, and found wanting.</div>

</div>Well, I think that we can evalutate any top-end WWS that is provided.  I mean, if someone provides a WWS that shows a T6'd shadowstep rogue doing 2k+ DPS, and we look and don't see any major abnormalities (3-4x heroism, 60%+ crit rate, etc), we can then start saying "Okay, what are we missing".  I'm trying to be fair in drawing a line in the sand and saying "I believe that this line is outside of the capability of Shadowstep builds, but is capable by combat builds - if what you say is true (that whatever build is near-equal to combat), then you should be able to READILY provide a WWS that meets these criteria."<br>
<br>
I'll admit the 1555 WWS of me on Morogrim is something of a rarity, since I don't get 0-grave attempts that often, but it is VERY reproducable, in the case that I do get 0 graves.<br>
<br>
So, to further simply it - there's 3 fights I can realistically see marking off DPS on - T4: Magtheridon, T5: Morogrim, T6: Teron.</div>

</div>I was going to sit down and discredit everything that you have stated that is obviously wrong, but others have beaten me too it.  So let me make it simple for you:<br>
<br>
Theorycrafting can tell us how much we will hit for with any combination of gear and mob armor, we know the mechanics of the abilities, and we know how cycles work.  Therefore with reasonable certainty we can determine that over an infinite period of time, your AVERAGE DPS, will be around a certain value, with a very high decree of accuracy.  <br>
<br>
More importantly, we can determine the relative value of stats, aka it is far more important to me to know if 10 Crit, 10 Hit, 5 Agi/Hit, 10 Agi, 5 Agi/7 Stam or 10 AP/7 Stam will give me the largest increase in DPS, based on a given set of gear, abilities and boss armor.<br>
<br>
So based off of all of this information and testing, we have concluded that the highest current DPS Spec is Combat Swords, at certain gear levels the TOTAL CONTRIBUTION including Hemo Charges, from a Tri-Spec Hemo Build will come close, and a Shadow Step build will lag behind by about 12%.  Considering T6 Gear, a good DPS number is ~2000, that means Shadowstep would do 240 DPS less, from my experience with an extremely talented rogue in my guild, that is accurate.<br>
<br>
Here is our Teron kill 2 weeks ago, Levee, Apocc and I are combat, Hafoc is Shadowstep, while Combat Spec'ed Hafoc does essentially the same DPS as me, however here he is 210 DPS behind me (and ~150 DPS behind Levee and Apocc):<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302213022/http://wowwebstats.com/p4pmorliatkng?s=2154-2376" target="_blank">Wow Web Stats</a><br>
<br>
Gurtogg - Levee got Fel Rage, Hafoc is 260 DPS behind me<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302213022/http://wowwebstats.com/p4pmorliatkng?s=4436-4898" target="_blank">Wow Web Stats</a><br>
<br>
Mother - Levee's gear is the issue here (no 2 piece with SR Gear on), Hafoc is 190 DPS behind on a much lower DPS total)<br>
<br>
Hyjal - More of the same<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302213022/http://wowwebstats.com/xnymkby6bytv5" target="_blank">WWS Loading...</a><br>
<br>
Now Hafoc is Shadowstep not because he thinks it is better, but because we are in full farm mode and he is having fun and not respecing from his PvP Spec each week, come Sunwell he will be Combat Swords.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now you are trying to claim that Shadowstep does as much or more damage.  There is no scenario or set of gear where that can occur.  You talk about the skill of the player, guess what, I consider myself a skilled player, I will do more damage as Combat, the mechanics dictate it, you on the other hand may do more damage as Shadowstep, the cycles are much easier, you don't have the cooldowns to manage, you don't have random energy generation to deal with, you don't have to adjust on the fly.<br>
<br>
Also, Kael is a horrible fight to model DPS on, the movement time alone means that Shadowstep if used properly is very helpful, however the spreadsheets do deal with movement time, which is why Cat's Swiftness has a lower DPS value then Dexterity and Swift Skyfire Diamond is one of the worst Meta's, yes in a movement fight these abilities will increase your DPS on SWS, because that is Total Damage/Total time raid is in combat, WWS does Total Damage/Time YOU are in combat (something like time from first interaction with boss to time of last interaction with boss, and if you don't do anything for more then 5 second in between it stops counting until you do)<br>
<br>
Some things to keep in mind:<br>
-Yes, your white damage will be higher, this is due to Serrated Blades, the exact value is variable depending on boss armor.  Nothing at the bottom of the combat tree affects white damage (other then Expertise.<br>
-Your yellow damage will go down, you have less energy, do fewer finishers, some of your finishers are dodged etc.  Everything at the bottom of the Combat Tree affects Yellow Damage.<br>
<br>
<br>
One final point:<br>
Teron Parse again-<br>
Me (Combat) - <br>
Melee - 68%<br>
Sinister Strike - 21%<br>
Rupture - 5%<br>
Deadly -3%<br>
<br>
Hafoc (SS)<br>
Melee - 57%<br>
Hemo - 31%<br>
Rupture - 5%<br>
Deadly - %<br>
Hafoc is a Assination/Shadowstep Build, which will have less white damage then a combat/Shadowstep build<br>
<br>
His average Rupture ticked for 429, and mine for 286, however while he had 48 ticks, I got 68 due to more finishers, due to more energy, result, while his was ticking for 50% more, he only did 1000 more rupture damage then me.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
So in conclusion, I have to assume that you are basing this entirely on Kael, thus your analysis is flawed, or you are a bad rogue and a complete idiot, hopefully it is the former, but based on your posting, I am leaning towards the later.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Well, I think that we can evalutate any top-end WWS that is provided.

</div>I posted some parses above, Hafoc is Shadowstep 20/0/41, while not ideal, it is going to be close to 0/20/41, with predictable variations:<br>
-Lower White Damage due to no Duel Wield, no Precision<br>
-More energy due to Relentless, and more CPs due to Ruthlessness<br>
<br>
The issue is, that he is basing his conclusions off of Kael, which is the wrong fight to due it on, since your time on target could be significantly higher with Shadowstep, not to mention the time out of combat is hugely variable, along with many other factors.</div>

I've posted ~2400 DPS on Teron (with insane buffs + heroisms, but still).  2400 minus 12 percent is still 2100.

				<div style="font-style:italic">Left: How would you like me to provide the information on my gear? I assume you could simply check the armory to see what gear I have, but I might be in pvp gear when I log out...<br>

</div>Specifically, if you had any significant gear changes in between parses, let us know. Checking your armory doesn't work that well unless you log out in DPS gear; PVP gear vs. DPS gear will make about as much difference in damage as going from Combat to Shadowstep spec.<br>
<br>
Also, the trinkets you use can have a huge impact. Did you get any trinket upgrades between parses? Between combat and Shadowstep specs? Etc.<br>
<br>
However, since someone else has just posted several WWS's which convincingly are putting Shadowstep 150-250 DPS behind in T6 content, you probably have a tough audience. One thing we can (and will) look at is the damage breakdown in your WWS vs. Hafoc's to see what the differences between going combat and assassination are.</div>

</div>I would still be surprised to see Shadowstep break 2000 DPS, Combat is going to scale better with the potential buffs.  When going to the extreme, you can chain heroisms, haste pots, and drums, anything else is pretty standard these days, and the synergy between combat and haste makes me think it will pull away more and more.</div>

</div>The gear in question is what I'm currently wearing on armor, except WSC swapped out for Ashtongue Talisman, and Arcanite Steam-Pistol instead of Twisted Blades.<br>
<br>
Disable Murder on the sheet, as Teron is not Murderable.  Set boss armor to 6200, as Teron is a low-armor boss.  Now, enable the following buffs:<br>
<br>
Improved Gift of the Wild<br>
Imp Battle Shout<br>
Solarian's Sapphire<br>
Imp Blessing of Might<br>
Blessing of Kings<br>
Leader of the Pack<br>
Imp Hunter's Mark<br>
Expose Weakness<br>
Flask of Relentless Assault<br>
Spicy Hot Talbuk<br>
Grace of Air (yes, I had a shaman twisting it for the attempt in question)<br>
Strength of Earth<br>
Curse of Recklessness<br>
Sunder Armor x5<br>
Faerie Fire<br>
Mangle<br>
Use Haste Pots Every Cooldown<br>
Drums of War<br>
Heroism/Bloodlust<br>
Windfury MH<br>
Deadly Poison OH<br>
<br>
So, I show that as 2114 DPS.  But here's the key thing.  Heroisms in the sheet are per 10 minutes; in order to get an accurate estimate of Heroism in a 3-minute fight, we should triple the number of Heroisms listed.  Plus, on the fight in question, I got 3 Heroisms.  Hence, to accurately model the amount of heroism I had for the attempt, set Number of Heroisms to 9.  This brings total DPS to 2352.<br>
<br>
Note that in reality, I also had a Scroll of Agility V on, and the 5th member of my group was a Ret Pally, which probably adds another 50 DPS or so, which gets us up to the 2400 range - which is what I observed.<br>
<br>
Of course, by Shaker's point, we shouldn't be counting on 3 heroisms; rather, we can only use 1.  However, for a 3 minute fight, that's still the equivalent of 3 per 10 minutes, so we set Number of Heroisms to 3.  This drops DPS to 2173.  If we then respec to 0/20/40, we're still reporting 1937 DPS.  And with the aforementioned agility scroll and ret pally - or having an MS warrior in the raid, or whatever... 2k just doesn't look that unreasonable to me.</div>

		<div id="post_message_603130">Within the flames, I want to point out some quick facts about the dps sheets concerning the shadowstep - combat-sword builds discussion.<br>
<br>
The sheets tend to assume the best case for combat swords builds while assuming the worst case for the shadowstep builds in the following occasions.<br>
<br>
<b>1st assumption</b> is, averaged out energy regeneration. This is a major assumption. With this assumption, the spreadsheet calculated DPS of  the combat sword build tend to get higher than the real situation. The reason for that is, energy regeneration can spike and does not always allow the best cycle to be applied for a combat-swords build. On the other hand, shadowstep builds are much less subject to this and their real DPS should be more closer to the spreadsheet calculations.<br>
<br>
<b>2nd assumption</b> is, non-stop white dps. While this assumption holds true for some boss-fights, clearly it does not hold true for the others. As (assasination) shadowstep builds rely heavily on yellow damage (mainly the hemorrhage damage), any interruption in the white DPS (i.e. running around, changing targets) will shift the scales to the (assasination) shadowstep builds due to the energy regeneration in the absence of white DPS.<br>
<br>
Now, with regards to the (raid) utility, which build wins out? This should be the question we must ask. Answers can vary, and the question change its form depending on the raid progress.<br>
<br>
<b>1st case - progress run:</b> <br>
<br>
Are there any DPS checks that involve non-stop, single target DPS? Will there be a shadowstep rogue failing while a combat-sword rogue is passing this check?<br>
<br>
Are there any strategy checks which involve escaping from damage in time? Will there be a combat-sword rogue failing while a shadowstep rogue is cheating death during these checks?<br>
<br>
Which of the above are more important on the progress runs?<br>
<br>
<b>2nd case - farm run:</b> <br>
<br>
Assuming that both shadowstep rogue and combat-specced rogue already passed the DPS checks, what should be the concern of the raid?<br>
<br>
I believe I have made my point by asking these questions.</div>

		<div id="post_message_606101">I've run into a problem recently, I'm getting threat capped more and more often.  Mostly this is due to the fact that our MT stacks avoidance, which is fine, just makes it hard for me to dps as much as I would like to.  For example this evening on morogrim I had to vanish at around 90-92%.  In addition my enhance shamman has just started twisting totems so while not perfect I still had salv and grace of air.  I was also attempting to get feint into my cycle, which pretty much resulted in me keeping SnD up and getting a rupture off every other cycle.  This was also before I got Talon off him and was still using spiteblade, now I'm sure it will only get worse.  I didn't end up being threat capped at the end as I got graved three times in a row at the end, but from the rate I was closing before that I certainly would have before vanish came back up.  Does anyone have any recomendations of how to avoid this?  If this keeps up I will probably end up specing Hemo to get a shorter vanish.  The only thing I can really think of currently is to try dps slower at the begining so that I can vanish at 85% or so.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I've run into a problem recently, I'm getting threat capped more and more often.  Mostly this is due to the fact that our MT stacks avoidance, which is fine, just makes it hard for me to dps as much as I would like to.  For example this evening on morogrim I had to vanish at around 90-92%.  In addition my enhance shamman has just started twisting totems so while not perfect I still had salv and grace of air.  I was also attempting to get feint into my cycle, which pretty much resulted in me keeping SnD up and getting a rupture off every other cycle.  This was also before I got Talon off him and was still using spiteblade, now I'm sure it will only get worse.  I didn't end up being threat capped at the end as I got graved three times in a row at the end, but from the rate I was closing before that I certainly would have before vanish came back up.  Does anyone have any recomendations of how to avoid this?  If this keeps up I will probably end up specing Hemo to get a shorter vanish.  The only thing I can really think of currently is to try dps slower at the begining so that I can vanish at 85% or so.</div>

</div>Give your tank ~ 10 k threat before you start dps, if you have salv on and use feint after a few attacks to begin with you should be fine. If you aren't, vanish. If you still get anywhere near your MT on a boss like morogrim he is doing something wrong.</div>

</div>Yes, I suspect he is doing something wrong.  I am going to try to talk to him and get him to do more tps, but until he does that will not solve my problem.  You implied that I might not need to vanish if I give him a 10k head start, that is not anywhere near the case.  I can't say what his threat was at when I started dpsing, but I had the shaman threat reduction totem in addition to salv and was using feint when it was up the whole fight.

</div>Both of those OHs will be roughly the same, for some people one will be *slightly* better, I would go for which ever you get first.  The s2 sword is barely the winner for me.  About DST my understanding and what my guild hunters seem to think is that Tsunami Talisman is the best hunter trinket (atleast at our progression level) and that DST is very nice for them it isn't the best.  You might not be able to convince him to pass it to you, but it could be worth a shot to work out a deal to pass TT to him if he passes DST to you.  This is assuming you are at/close to Leo, can't tell from your gear as it is pvp and armory wouldn't let me look at your guild.</div>

I know it won't help you in any matter but on morogrim i start dps when tank has ~7k threat and never has to use feint (not even vanish in most cases). One or two water tombs u might get act like uber_feint if u want to know <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304073244im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/biggrin.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":D" class="inlineimg"><br>

</div>If you are threat capped that much, your warrior definitely needs help on improving his TPS. He's holding back the whole raid dps and will cause you to wipe due to insufficient rdps on enrage timer bosses.<br>
<br>
As an interim solution to keep your cycles as optimal as possible, I'd suggest to respec to hemo trispec 11/28/22 or 11/27/23, dropping one point of dirty deeds for preparation (and 2 points of elusiveness).<br>
That build is definitely not the absolute maximum dps you can do (that's irrelevant when you're in a threat capped situation) but it will give you plenty of vanishes which will ensure that you never need to include feint in your cycle, except maybe one or two very early in the encounter before your first vanish.<br>
And it may also help increase the warrior TPS thanks to the hemo debuff <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304073244im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/wink.gif" border="0" alt="" title=";)" class="inlineimg"><br>
<br>
When your warrior gets his act together, you can respec to whatever max dps template you prefer.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">As regarding Cheap Shot applying poisons, I think that might be true, since I've myself experienced applying poisons with feint. It's easy to test out, just go to Gammon in Org, Criipling poison on main hand, and aggro him using feint. Every third feint or so, he'll get the poison.<br>
<br>
Edit: After going back and trying it again i can't seem to reproduce my initial result, so my original observation was either a bug in the game occasionally causing non-damaging attacks to proc poisons or my memory is just simply wrong. I tend to believe the latter.</div>

But I play a rogue on my server with a 20 41 0 spec with an envenom rotation of something like Xs/5e. I am only beat out by beast mastery hunters as fair as raid dps goes (so long as its not a poison immune boss like VR). I read your post about rupture but the numbers still dont add up to me... My envenom crits often. I have a 25% crit rating with swords and it can hit upwards of 1500 to 3000 easily and every now and then 4000. Fully raid buff without mongoose procs I have a 31% crit. 33 if I was fortunate enough to hook up with a shammy for grace of air. So if I usually hit for 1100 without criting and crit for 1500 to 3000, how is a rupture better? A 5r does 1000 damage plus24% of your AP. I have 1800 ap. so that would be like 432 added damage... 1432 damage. And you cant crit with rupture, right? So how is it better?

				<div style="font-style:italic">So I don't know much about numbers... and I am fairly new to actually calculating out what is better than what... But I play a rogue on my server with a 20 41 0 spec with an envenom rotation of something like Xs/5e. I am only beat out by beast mastery hunters as fair as raid dps goes (so long as its not a poison immune boss like VR). I read your post about rupture but the numbers still dont add up to me... My envenom crits often. I have a 25% crit rating with swords and it can hit upwards of 1500 to 3000 easily and every now and then 4000. Fully raid buff without mongoose procs I have a 31% crit. 33 if I was fortunate enough to hook up with a shammy for grace of air. So if I usually hit for 1100 without criting and crit for 1500 to 3000, how is a rupture better? A 5r does 1000 damage plus24% of your AP. I have 1800 ap. so that would be like 432 added damage... 1432 damage. And you cant crit with rupture, right? So how is it better? I dont doubt you guys know what youre doing I just wanna understand.</div>

	</tr>
	</table>
</div>There are a couple things to consider: <br>
<br>
- Envenom can be resisted, which blows your combo points - Rupture can be dodged, but you don't lose your points<br>
- Deadly Poison continues ticking when you Rupture, but not when you Envenom. If you -really- want to see why Rupture is a better choice than Envenom, look at how much that 5-stack of Deadly Poison is doing that wouldn't be there otherwise. <br>
<br>
The thing that concerns me though is that you said you're running a cycle using Envenom. Either you have some very good hit rating, or you're poisoning your main hand sword (which is a BIG no-no). Saying that your shaman is dropping Grace of Air makes me think I may be right, but I sure hope not. <br>
<br>
Ideally, you would only have Deadly Poison on your offhand, and allow your shaman to drop Windfury (which a Deadly Poison on your main hand would override). This provides much higher DPS, and consequentially would make an Envenom cycle harder to maintain. Enter: Rupture.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I've run into a problem recently, I'm getting threat capped more and more often.  Mostly this is due to the fact that our MT stacks avoidance, which is fine, just makes it hard for me to dps as much as I would like to.  For example this evening on morogrim I had to vanish at around 90-92%.  In addition my enhance shamman has just started twisting totems so while not perfect I still had salv and grace of air.  I was also attempting to get feint into my cycle, which pretty much resulted in me keeping SnD up and getting a rupture off every other cycle.  This was also before I got Talon off him and was still using spiteblade, now I'm sure it will only get worse.  I didn't end up being threat capped at the end as I got graved three times in a row at the end, but from the rate I was closing before that I certainly would have before vanish came back up.  Does anyone have any recomendations of how to avoid this?  If this keeps up I will probably end up specing Hemo to get a shorter vanish.  The only thing I can really think of currently is to try dps slower at the begining so that I can vanish at 85% or so.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</div>Morogrim is special as I mention below, I always asked our shaman to twist in Tranquil Air for the first 25% or so, not only for the rogues but also for himself, by that point you should be fine, and when you start catching up vanish.  Also, if your tank is socketing his gear with anything other then +12 Stam gems at that level you need to have a long talk with him.  Stamina is going to allow him to take bigger hits, generate more rage, and more threat, avoidance is good, but you get plenty of it from gear without socketing for it.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Give your tank ~ 10 k threat before you start dps, if you have salv on and use feint after a few attacks to begin with you should be fine. If you aren't, vanish. If you still get anywhere near your MT on a boss like morogrim he is doing something wrong.</div>

	</table>
</div>Ok, this is just wrong, I rode the tank on just about every Morogrim kill, normally finishing somewhere between 100-108% threat, including a vanish.  Morogrim is unique in that me has an ability that causes your tank to hit slower, and thus his rage generation at the beginning is rather gimped, not to mention the Heroic Strike is tied to auto attack speed, so slower attacks = fewer heroics = less threat.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Also, I need a convincing arguement to persuade my Huntard guild leader not to take DST, seeing as it is the best rogue trinket in the game.  His arguement is that it is also the best hunter trinket in the game, though I haven't seen any illidan geared hunters using it.</div>

	</table>
</div>This is normally due to the fact that Illidan killing guilds have intelligent loot systems that make sure loot gets to the right people.  DST is the best rogue trinket in the game, and probably the best warrior trinket as well, whereas Tsunami Talisman, Madness, the Ashtongue Trinket and possibly even Hourglass of the Unraveler are better for hunters.  If you end up getting a ton of DSTs sure a hunter can pick one up, but taking it over a rogue who you know is decent and is going to stick around is just stupid.<br>

However in the Rogue DPS spreadsheet the AToL is far inferior to WSC both in early BT gear and still later in late BT gear. What's the reason for this? How good is the AToL compared to WSC and TT?

</div>This depends on your cycle, and whether you tailor your play to max out the trinket.  My original feeling was that it couldn't be right, however, if you let your energy tick to almost full before doing a finisher, and are using the 4s/5r or 5s/5r cycle, you can get in 3-5 Sinister Strikes during the buff, which means that instead of looking at the average value (as I think the DPS Spreadsheet does), you are looking at a much higher effective crit rate on your attacks.  Trinkets still come down to get what you can when you can, personally I use WSC and Madness, and still plan to pick up the next DST that drops (long story but basically my luck on them has sucked), and I have the Ashtongue in the bank because most of the time I prefer passive trinket, however I have debated pulling the Ashtongue back out for higher armor bosses.</div>

</div>While there was a long explanation for this issue, I will try to cut it short.<br>
<br>
1st, rupture costs 25 energy instead of 35. 10 energy usually means 300 damage. So, you lose 300 damage by using a 35 energy finisher for the start.<br>
2nd, your envenom hits for (1250*0.7+2500*0.3)=1625 on average<br>
3rd, your rupture hits for 1432 damage. If you add the 10 energy gain by using rupture, it becomes 1732 damage (which can be further improved by mangle on the mob.<br>
4th, you lose all of your deadly poison charges on the mob. You lose many poison damage there.</div>

</div>Our tank actually is in mostly BT/MH gear, he took a break from wow while he was in the top guild on our server and just started playing again a bit ago, but regardless he stacks stam/avoidance.  I think he sockets mostly for stam, but either way his rage bar will be full after the first 10-20 seconds of the fight anyway, he was not rage starved he just doesn't have much in his gear that would boost his tps.  I didn't realize that morogrim slowed attacks, that makes me less concerned.  I guess another part of the issue is that I'm still not 100% accoustomed to monitoring my threat, as almost 100% of SSC/TK has either a decent amount of not in melee range or some aggro reset built into the fights.</div>

</div>Fundamentally, I wouldn't trust the Rogue DPS Sheet very much on trinket effects, since they tend to be the sort of challenging, fiddly effects that give that sheet problems.  Thus, for this particular question, I would argue that the Rogue Gear sheet is the better resource, and what one finds with it is that Dragonspine is clearly tops, and at low-T6 itemization, Ashtongue is clearly 2nd, with Madness/WSC in the next tier,  followed by Tsunami Talisman/Berserker's Call.  However, at high-T6 levels of itemization - particularly if you're using Executioner - WSC/Madness catch up with Ashtongue and, in fact, WSC becomes quite plausibly the 2nd best trinket in the game.<br>
<br>
For instance, EAP values for me with my current gear in typical raid buffs:<br>
DST: 215<br>
WSC: 189<br>
AToL: 185<br>
MotB: 177<br>
TT: 155<br>
BC: 150<br>
<br>
If, however, I downgrade my gear to, say, what I was wearing 2 months ago, I get these values instead:<br>
DST: 207<br>
AToL: 193<br>
MotB: 176<br>
WSC: 176<br>
TT: 155<br>
BC: 150<br>
<br>
Basically: there's a lot of armor pen gear in T6 which increases the relative value of WSC and MotB; since WSC has more armor pen, it improves faster allowing it to claim the 2nd best trinket slot.</div>

		<div id="post_message_606609">On the topic of DST - While I agree it IS the best rogue trinket ingame, it is also the best Warrior AND Hunter trinket ingame.  For rogues, we have AToL and WSC which are both *nearly* as good.  Warriors and Hunters have.. TT and Beserkers Call?  Not sure how Madness factors in for them, but its about 4th best for rogues.  In terms of drop rates and availability.. it does sort of make sense to let a hunter have DST in the long run since every rogue will get a AToL and its pretty hard to not get a WSC.  That said, if your Hunter guildmate is a Huntard and can't maintain any sort of proper cycle.. or the warrior thinks 2H dps w/o Slam or Blood Frenzy is a great idea... well yea, the rogue will make best use out of it.<br>
<br>
This of course changes if for instance Gruul is your guild's progression fight and AToL, WSC and TT are out of the picture.<br>
<br>
What I'm trying to say is - giving DST to a rogue for the SOLE reason that he is a rogue and the "competition" is a hunter makes no sense.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
As for the Morogrim threat thing:<br>
Likely the main issue is improving your tanks TPS.  Get him a Shaman who drops WF.  Not GoA, WF.  Having a feral druid in there can't hurt and since you already have a shaman dropping WF, a dps warrior (battle shout) can't hurt either.  That said, if you only have 1 dps warrior - give him to the melee group of course.  If your tank is in danger of dieing, you can likely fill the 3 remaining spots (tank + shaman being first 2) in the tank group with something a bit better than another warrior.  A warlock (imp), a pally (devo aura), a tree (ToL), etc are all good choices for survivability.<br>
Next, get your tank to read <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304073244/http://elitistjerks.com/f31/t18771-protection_warrior/" target="_blank">The Protection Warrior</a> .  It has excellent information.  As a 2-3 sentence general summary.. Use Shield Slam, Revenge, Devastate, Devastate as your primary "GCD" rotation.  If you have enough extra rage to sustain that rotation, slip in as many Heroic Strikes as you can while maintaining the GCD rotation - on Morogrim you should have no problem keeping Heroic Strikes up most if not all of the time.  Get some hit rating and/or Expertise to up TPS.<br>
<br>
As for how to survive in the meantime.. Start the fight after 5-6k tank threat with auto attack and feint only.  Keep SnD up if you want - singe SS and just keep refreshing off of Ruthlessness procs until you need to SS again.  The idea is that you are doing ~60% of your total dps and feinting on CD - the more you can feint, the more dmg you can do in a threat-capped situation.  The longer you can wait to vanish - the more of a threat lead your tank has and the more threat you dump.  Hold off as long as you possibly can.  As for a cycle?  5s/5r should be fine with 3x feint in there.  Drop to a 4-point rupture if you need I guess to lower your dps (wow.. that felt weird typing that) and save you some energy (40 energy for 1 less SS, 5 more for less ruthlessness, 35 net savings).<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Rupture vs Envenom:<br>
Yep, just like everyone said:<br>
-25 energy vs 35<br>
-loss of DP stack<br>
-Mangle (can't compare to Storm Strike since *someone* will use those debuffs anyways - its not really a raid dps gain, especially if you have an ele sham [or moonkin?])<br>
-etc</div>

		<div id="post_message_606623">I would say, from a RDPS standpoint, avoidance is the worst thing a warrior can stack.  If you don't have enough healing to keep an adequately geared tank up on most any ssc/tk fight, you should recruit healers, not get the tank to stack avoidance.  <br>
<br>
A tank can only "not" take damage so often, there will be strings of hits that avoidance can't mitigate and if the healing isn't there, he'll still get trucked.  From a rogue standpoint, its' just as bad.  If the tank is avoiding the attacks, all that rage and possible tps is lost and thus all the possible dps is lost.  I've yet to see a t5+ tank gear/gem for avoidance and win as the MT.  If you are tanking the second illidan flame, maybe avoidance is best, you'll have made enough threat by that time to cover...but overall, never, ever be an avoidance tank.<br>
<br>
As for the whole "vanish at 90%".  If a vanish at 90% is saving you from pulling agro again, why not wait like 10-15 secs before attacking period and then going all out?  I can literally vanish at 65-70% and still come withing 5-10% of the tanks total threat by the end of the fight.  I normally wait for 15-20k threat from the tank on that fight and then vanish around 60%. But, like the others have said, its your tank, not you, don't worry.  Get him fixed and you'll probably see a lot of raid encounters made easier, especially if you've heard locks or mages gripe about pulling agro or sitting at the ceiling the whole fight.</div>

		<div id="post_message_606645">First off, thanks for this thread, the OP and many of the following replies have been an interesting read and they've helped me stave off boredom at work <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304042139im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/biggrin.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":D" class="inlineimg"><br>
<br>
Anyway, just wanted to comment on a couple things...<br>
<br>
Regarding threat problems on Morogrim; honestly to me this sounds like crappy tanking. I don't have the best gear in the world by any means but our last Moro kill my DPS was 1500 and I go pretty much balls to the wall right from the beginning. The only lead time I give the tank is pretty much the time it takes for me to walk from the back of the pillar to the boss, so like 5 seconds at most. Threat wise I ride the MT pretty hard but I never pass him and the earliest I've ever needed to vanish is like 50%. Dunno, maybe you're doing considerably more DPS (certainly possible) or maybe your MT is just not generating much threat. I've never felt it was an even remotely agro sensitive fight though (for rogues anyway).<br>
<br>
As far as trinkets go I was lucky to get DST back in the day when Gruul was considered hard but I've had shit for luck on trinkets since then so I'm still using hourglass as my 2nd trinket. It's interesting to read about everyones opinions on trinkets, espically armor ignoring ones such as WSC....<br>
<br>
...which brings me to something that's been on my mind lately. I wish there was a more reliable way to quickly model the effectiveness of ArP vs other stats but it seems to be affected by so many non-linear things that figuring out a basic per-point value is very difficult. Using the gear/dps spreadsheets helps with this obviously but it would be nice if there was an easier way to weight ArP vs other stats accurately.</div>

		<div id="post_message_606664">Well, to some extent it depends on your tank.  If you're that threat-limited and working on Tidewalker, it's probably safe to assume that the fight is reasonably long (8-10 min) - hence, you really should be planning around 2 vanishes rather than one.<br>
<br>
For instance, when I was doing Tidewalker the guild's MT had extremely low aggro, so in order to stay behind him I'd wait to open fire, feint regularly, and generally play very conservatively on aggro down to 85-90% (sitting at 95% tank aggro all the way down), vanish, and then burn all out; I'd catch him again before the end of the fight, but usually there was enough of a lead that vanish was up again by the time I caught him the 2nd time.  So I'd vanish once at 90 and once at 40-50 or so, and it worked fine.  <br>
<br>
Working out the numbers: say you generate 20% more aggro than the tank.  Thus, in the 5 minutes between vanishes, you generate as much aggro as the tank generates in 6 minutes.  Hence, you need to give him a 1 minute head start to avoid catching up - so vanish 1 minute into the fight, and you're pretty much good.  And 1 minute into a fight that can easily take 10+ minutes, and we're talking a vanish right around 90%.<br>
<br>
Of course, if you have to choose between waiting a bit too long to vanish or blowing it a bit too early, it's better to wait longer - so you might want to wait till 85 just to be sure, but you get the idea.<br>
<br>
The numbers also change if you overaggro the tank by more (or less) than 20%; however, the less you beat him by the sooner you can vanish the first time, and if you're beating your tank by more than 20%, something is usually very wrong.  So blowing at 85-90 should usually work pretty well.<br>
<br>
The other thing to keep in mind is that there's no fundamental difference between opening fire (almost) immediately and holding back versus waiting to start and then going all out.  The total amount of damage you do is the same, so personally in an aggro limited situation I prefer to open early just with autoattack and then add SS in once the tank has a decent lead.  The added advantage of this is since you start generating a small amount of aggro right away, you can also start feinting right away, and every feint in an aggro-limited situation is pure added damage.  Similarly, in highly threat-limited situations, making use of Anaesthetic Poison can make sense.<br>
<br>
Long story short: I find the best way to deal with low-aggro situations is to make use of all -aggro abilities you have at your disposal to control aggro for the first little bit of the fight, and plan for two vanishes over the fight duration.</div>

</div>One way to do this is to use the equivalency values in the spreadsheets for your gear level.<br>
<br>
1) Put in your current gear<br>
2) Use the macro (DPS Spreadsheet) or find the appropriate sheet (Gear Spreadsheet) to get the equivalency table<br>
<br>
You should be able to get a customized value for ArP for your particular spec and gear setup.<br>
<br>
For me, for example, 10 ArP ~= 1.3 AGI<br>
<br>
This is the best way I've found to deal with it, since the value of ArP goes up the more of it you have (or the less armor the boss has).</div>

		<div id="post_message_606946">I want to first apologize if this question has already been brought up and I missed it, I have only discovered this forum recently and as much as I have tried to read through it all, I do sometimes miss the obvious.  I also want to thank those of you who have put so much work into this because since reading here and working on my rotations and the correct gems/enchants as I can get them, I have seen a noticeable improvement in my dps in raids.  I am math deficient though and statistics in particular is much like trying to read hierglyphics so I am struggling with a lot of the formulas posted on the forum and the spreadsheets.  So I appreciate your patience with my question.<br>
<br>
I'm currently specc'd combat daggers for raids weeknights and am speccing pvp weekends now to arena and start working towards arena weapons because of how OP they are and faster to get than the weapons in the instances my aid is progressing through.  We have finished Kara and are regularly killing Gruul and just beginning progression into SSC/TK and ZA.  I have 2 t4 pieces currently.  I do not dispute that combat swords is more dps, I see it for myself regularly, but I enjoy playing daggers more and with the help of this forum in particular, have still been able to maintain high dps in raids to stay in the top 5-6 on trash pulls and top 3-5 on bosses, some of this could be improved mainly by gear as I have plenty of room to improve there, and that is the reason why I'm looking at pvp weapons now.  So I would like to stay daggers so that I can enjoy many of the talents rogues have the require a MH dagger.  However, I was looking at the arena off-hand swords and they seem to offer more dps than the daggers, though not quite as fast.  But still faster than the offhand I have from Kara right now (Emerald Ripper).  <br>
<br>
So I'm trying to decide if I should keep the combat dagger specc and just get the S1 offhand dagger to start with while I work on earning arena points, or if I should consider moving some points around to get 4 points in swords on top of the 5pts in dagger specialization, and get the S1 offhand sword instead.  To do it, I had to lose a point in ruthlessness and have no points in lethality.  And a copy of my proposed specc would be at:  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304042139/http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/classes/rogue/talents.html?0052031000000000000003203051011550140023210510500000000000000000000" target="_blank">World Of Warcraft Talent Calculator</a><br>
<br>
My thoughts behind this is that it might be better dps in a sustained boss fight with the offhand sword sometimes getting the extra procc on my mainhand then if I had the offhand dagger with the +5% crit, because I believe, tho possibly wrong, that I only lose the 5% crit on my offhand attacks, but not on my MH since I would have a MH dagger.  Since I am truly awful at math, I am asking for some help with this.  And if this the dumbest noobest thing and obviously wrong, I know you all will make sure I know that.  It might be best to put those 4 points I have in swords elsewhere, like lethality and just get the slightly faster offhand S1 dagger for now while I work towards S2/S3 gear.  I just haven't found a combat dagger/sword conversation yet.</div>

		<div id="post_message_606957">Hybrid dagger/sword tends not to work very well, for a couple reasons.<br>
<br>
First, relative to hybrid fist/sword or mace/sword, you're losing more valuable talents.  Fist/Sword is only losing points in poison talents, which is a fairly small source of DPS.  Dagger/sword has to give up, like, Lethality, or something of comparable worth; hence, you lose a lot more by OHing a sword.<br>
<br>
Secondly, the power of OH sword spec comes from the fact that your weapons are of vastly dissimilar speeds.  When you have a MH Sword/Fist/Mace, you're making unnormalized attacks at 2.6+ speed, whereas with a MH dagger, the sword spec procs will only be at 1.8 speed, which reduces the advantage you gain by a third.<br>
<br>
Hence, sword spec benefits a MH dagger build a lot less than it does a MH Fist/Mace/Sword build, and it requires giving up more to get, so it tends not to be particularly value.<br>
<br>
For more information on your specific case, consult your local spreadsheet.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">In the rogue DPS spreadsheet, currently, armor penetration procs are handled by averaging the armor penetration over the uptime of the proc. However, it is known that this approach is faulty. Thus, both Warp Spring Coil and Executioner enchant are undervalued. The problem is known by dontmindme, he will probably remodel the procs it in the upcoming releases.</div>

</div>Ashtongue has its issues in the DPS spreadsheet.  I've recently looked over it's calculations and the calculations look reasonable but someone had nerfed it to 70% of its calculated value because it seemed wrong.  Now, removing that nerf is putting it a little higher than DST in the test build I was looking at, so I haven't decided what I'm doing with it yet.  Ashtongue is clearly currently undervalued on the DPS sheet.<br>
<br>
As to the Armor procs, both are currently in the DPS sheet as estimated % uptimes.<br>
<br>
I'm hoping to improve that modeling soon, but in the meantime, if you are looking to the answer to which of the trinkets is best (or even the Mongoose vs. Executioner issue) I'd trust the comparison on the Gear spreadsheet more at this time.</div>

</div>Sorry, I really don't understand this. You are wearing t5 gear so naturally you should have played rogue for some time. But energy regeneration rate is something you can figure at level 1, yourself, by just hovering your mouse over your character bars. Also, you have of course seen how much your abilities cost and that everytime you would use them the same amount of energy would be consumed and see the ticks move your energy back up in a constant manner.<br>
<br>
On top of that, you can see what each stat does on your character tab as well.<br>

That's self evident information as you said.</div>

Now my own carelessness asides, I need to know how much of a benefit this trinket--due to the 5/5 Commanding Presence it makes battle shout yield 470 AP Party Members--would be to the 2 rogues usually, theres also an enhance shammy and often a feral druid in the group but by the thread this is probably not the best place to ask for this info,  in the melee group when I'm there. The trinket is for me a personal dps loss of 20-22ish, according to spreadsheet and other sites I've looked at its also a dps loss that increases with gear level, so before I make another dumb itemization error, I'd love for you to tell me if me gimping myself is worth it for you guys.</div>

		<div id="post_message_608045">Hey there.<br>
<br>
We are a guild that working our way though BT atm, anyway, We just had our second Teron kill, I ended up first on WWS with 1623 dps. I'm currently running with 4/5 T5, S3 swords and a normal combat sword spec (no imp evi). The other rogues ended at 1331 dps and 1291 dps. We were all in same group with 1 warrior and 1 enhanchment shaman. We all got almost exactly same gear, just one rogue running with Kael mace and S2 off hand mace instead. The other rogues were doing the normal 2 SnD and 5 rupture combo, I did same, but Used Eviscerate instead for finnisher to try it out.<br>
<br>
Now i know rapture&gt;Evi almost always, but my dps was higher, so i was thinking, maybe it have something to do with the 4/5 T5, i mean, it says the 200 damage wont make evi better then rapture, But what about the 4/5 bonus? it makes it FREE COST, so if you compare rapture to Evis with NO ENERGY cost, what's is the best one? It's good to point out we dont have any feral druid atm... ( Any ferals looking for a guild =P? ).<br>
<br>
Maybe it's a good idea to use Evis every time you gain that buff? and rapture when you dont have it.</div>

		<div id="post_message_608048">Makes sense - under those circumstances you're only interested in the damage per finisher, not the damage per energy, and in that case Eviscerate may come out better.  It would depend on whether you have points in Imp. Eviscerate (unlikely), whether Mangle is up (likely) etc.  Certainly worth investigating with your specific gear set / buffs.</div>

		<div id="post_message_608065">While it's possible that Eviscerate with T5 4/5 competes with Rupture (I doubt it, but I can't rule it out entirely), it's not why you beat the other two rogues.  Rupture only adds about 100-150 DPS, and even if Eviscerate does a bit more, we're not talking a factor of 3 more.  So the fact that you won by 300 DPS is a sign that something else is going on - seems likely that your other rogues are either a) significantly undergeared or b) violating one of the aforementioned commandments of Rogue DPS (in particular, one of the first 5).  So I'd just be careful about drawing any conclusions based on that Teron kill on the Eviscerate/Rupture debate.<br>
<br>
Anyway, lets break out some numbers.  With, say, 2800 AP and 35% crit (not unreasonable with raid buffs) and no passive armor pen (usually the case for T5 rogues), a 100 DPS weapon, and a typical combat spec, we want to compare the damage from 4.4 Sinister Strikes and a Rupture to 4.4 Sinister Strikes and an Eviscerate, assuming 4/5 T5 procs.<br>
<br>
So, lets see here.  1 Sinister Strike will do about (2.7 * 100 + 2800/14 *2.4 + 98)*(1 + 1.3*.35)*1.06 = 1323 base damage, reduced to 1096 by armor.  So 4.4 SS will do 4822 damage.<br>
<br>
1 Eviscerate does about (1135 + .15 * 2800) * (1.35) = 2100 average base damage, reduced by armor to 1739.<br>
<br>
1 Rupture does (1000 + .24 * 2800) = 1672 damage without Mangle, or 2174 with Mangle.<br>
<br>
So, observation 1: If you have Mangle, Rupture just plain does more damage.  Hence, lets look at the nonMangled situation is a bit more detail.<br>
<br>
If 4/5 T5 procs, the cycle does 4.4*40 - 25 = 151 energy either way.  So the Eviscerate cycle has an energy efficiency of (4822 + 1739)/151 = 43.45 damage/energy, and the Rupture cycle has an energy efficiency of 43.01 damage per energy.<br>
<br>
So, *if* 4/5 T5 is up, *and* you don't have Mangle, it may marginally make sense to drop an Eviscerate rather than a Rupture.  In this example, if the buff was always up, you'd gain about 5 DPS by so doing.<br>
<br>
However, using Eviscerate *all* the time is a mistake; while it's .44 damage/energy more efficient when it procs, it's 1.72 damage/energy less efficient without the proc.  Hence, unless the set bonus is up 75%+ of the time when you're ready to drop a finisher, always using Eviscerate costs you damage.<br>
<br>
So, the answer seems to be that you can gain maybe 2 DPS in an Unmangled situation by dropping Eviscerate while 4/5 T5 is up and Rupturing otherwise.  But if you have Mangle, just always use Rupture.</div>

	</tr>
	</table>
</div>Where does the number 1135 come from?<br>
<br>
Average unmodified damage for Rank 10 Eviscerate is 1045. +200 from the T5 2piece (which you necessarily have if you have the 4piece!) takes it to 1245. You also forgot the 6% bonus to Eviscerate from Aggression.<br>
<br>
<br>
I calculate as follows:<br>
<br>
5pt Eviscerate base damage = 985-1105, average 1045<br>
Add 200 for the 2piece T5 = 1245<br>
Add in the AP factor = (1245 + .15 * 2800) = 1665<br>
Add 6% from Aggression = 1764.9<br>
Multiply up by crit rate (35%) = 2382.6 average base damage, reduced to 1973 by armor.  <br>
<br>
Edit: Actually that's still underestimated because of Lethality / RED. Accounting for those takes it to at least 2430 / 2010, depending on whether Lethality and RED are multiplicative or additive.<br>
<br>
Still not quite as good as Rupture+Mangle, but <i>much</i> closer. <br>
<br>
And remember, this is before taking imp. Eviscerate into account. With 3/3 imp eviscerate, you'd get another factor of 1.15, to give an average base damage of ~2790 (~2310 after armor). That's considerably better than Rupture even allowing for Mangle. The loss of poison DPS (or Murder) you'd take from going for imp. eviscerate however means that it's not worth speccing that way unless you know the boss can't be poisoned/murdered.<br>
<br>
Edit2:  Actually....<br>
<br>
3 points in Vile poisons loses you 12% * 75 DPS * .83 = 7.47 DPS. Assuming a cycle length of ~28 seconds, that's ~200 poison damage per cycle that you'd lose by speccing Imp Evis. instead of Vile Poisons. A fully talented Eviscerate has an advantage of at least 150 damage over Rupture + Mangle. Only a little more crit, and it'll be flat out better to spec for and use Eviscerate whenever the T5 4-piece proc is active, even if you have Mangle active.<br>
<br>
So what it boils down to is - what is the uptime for the T5 proc? Will it be active for 100% of your finishers, or only 10% of them? If it has high uptime, it's actually not clear cut at all whether Eviscerate or Rupture is the better option.</div>

		<div id="post_message_608110">Hmm, for some reason I was thinking Evis was base 935 average, so you're right about that.  However, I would point out that Lethality doesn't apply to Eviscerate, so it should be 1763.9 * (1 + .35 * 1.06) = 2418 raw, reduced to 2003 by armor.<br>
<br>
Closer?  Sure.  But Mangled Rupture still wins, as does unmangled unprocced rupture.  So, admittedly, my numbers were a bit off, but I think the conclusion is still valid.<br>
<br>
Regarding Improved Eviscerate: Yes, it helps, but it comes at the expense of Vile Poisons, which, on the average, will contribute more damage even if you're weaving Eviscerates in.  So, yes, if you spec that way you can cement Eviscerate's viability in non-Mangled situations when you have a 4/5 proc... but you'll do less damage overall than if you took the poison talents.</div>

<br>
Conclusion seems clear enough though.  If T5 4-piece procs and you don't have a feral druid, Eviscerate.  If you do have a feral (i.e. Mangle is up), Rupture.<br>
<br>
Might be worth some more detailed analysis in future though, to check out the impact of things like Executioner, WSC procs, mace spec etc. etc.  I think it's certainly possible that for some people, it'll be worth using Eviscerate on T5 procs even if Mangle is up.</div>

</div>Well, let's examine it.  We avoid attacking from the front because:<br>
<br>
1)  Parry strings cause the tank to be insta-gibbed<br>
2)  Melee cleaves cause us to be insta-gibbed<br>
3)  Increase in incoming tank damage stresses the healers more, even in the absence of insta-gibs<br>
4)  Our DPS is severely reduced<br>
<br>
Now, in a hypothetical situation where none of these four apply, it's conceivable that there might be an advantage (or at least no disadvantage) to attacking from in front. <br>
<br>
You suggest two potential situations.<br>
<br>
1) Tank is undergeared (insufficient damage). It seems a seriously bad idea to deliberately increase damage on a tank you know to be undergeared.<br>
<br>
2) Tank is overgeared. In this case, frankly, who cares? If you need to increase the incoming damage on the tank, it makes more sense for the tank to slap on DPS gear than for you to attack from the front.</div>

</div>Tanks carry around various sets of gear for stamina and avoidance. I think the tank can certainly focus more on threat generation by himself instead of damage mitigation. I'd rather not have to worry about potentially getting myself killed. <br>
<br>
Also, as Songster notes, if your tank (and, I assume, raid) is so overgeared for the content, why worry about your DPS output being a little lower than normal?</div>

This is normally due to the fact that Illidan killing guilds have intelligent loot systems that make sure loot gets to the right people.  DST is the best rogue trinket in the game, and probably the best warrior trinket as well, whereas Tsunami Talisman, Madness, the Ashtongue Trinket and possibly even Hourglass of the Unraveler are better for hunters.  If you end up getting a ton of DSTs sure a hunter can pick one up, but taking it over a rogue who you know is decent and is going to stick around is just stupid.<br>

</div>We just Cleared up to Vashj our second week of raiding SSC, so he has the option of getting TT, however he believes that DST is the best trinket for hunters as well.  I looked at an analysis thread of the trinket and it seems that there are mixed views of this, some claiming hunters get more attacks in any given minute than a rogue.  I've heard that TT is better than DST for hunters but haven't seen any huntercraft threads to back that statement up.<br>
<br>
Also I have a gear question.  I've replaces a couple things with hit in favor of haste and more AP, one of them being netherblade gloves with the badges gloves.  I'm thinking of getting the badges pants as well in favor of netherblade pants, but it would bring me down to only 260 hit rating.  I would still have the 2 peice bonus, and I will be getting WSC next, so that will bring me back up to 281.  Any thoughts as to what would be more valuable?</div>

</div>The short answer is to check your new acquisitions using the various spreadsheets.  They should give you the best answer.<br>

Having said that, adding hit is almost certainly the best way to increase DPS on otherwise equivalent items.  Normally this means gemming for hit.</div>

</div>While this is true (and something I definitely want people to keep in mind), being below the yellow attack no-miss zone is going to be a larger loss in DPS than above it, so the value of hit isn't continuous at this point.  THAT being said, no rogue who is even remotely reasonably geared/spec'd should have to worry about it due to the fact that you should have precision, and getting the 60-odd hit rating that you need on top of that is trivial.<br>
<br>
<br>
Also, regarding hit gemming, as you get into T5ish gear, you tend to see Agi/Hit coming to very close competitiveness with eachother.  Hit tends to edge it a little in a pure sustained situation, agi tends to edge hit in interrupted situations.  For these reasons, I personally gem nearly everything with Glinting gems.</div>

</div>True, although I'd note that the change in value at the yellow hit cap is not as large as most people expect.  Hit below the yellow hit cap as roughly the same effect as expertise (reducing miss chance of both white and yellow attacks), and Expertise for most of us is only worth about 10% more than Hit above the yellow hit cap.  So it's value increases, but it's not like it doubles or anything.<br>
<br>
Now, for PvP, kicking, and that sort of thing, the fact that your attacks more reliably gives it something of an advantage beyond that, but, fundamentally: the change in the value of hit at the yellow hit cap, while nontrivial, is not so strong as to override the underlying point, which is that you should use whatever gear is best, regardless of which stats it has to get that way, even under the yellow hit cap.<br>

</div>Agreed.  Particularly since agi also gives a bit of dodge, which has been known to be useful when a boss gets a bit out of position (or someone pulls aggro) and cleaves the melee, and on bosses (such as Zul'jin and Hex Lord in ZA) that have Whirlwind type abilities.  I'm a bit believer in socketing everything with orange, although a few yellow gems work in here and there if my guild happens to be low on oranges at the time.</div>

</div>The big reason why Hemo is still competitive to some extent with the debuff factored in, is, well, Hemo. Hemorrhage is the best talent, point-for-point, in any tree. AR is not a big part of your DPS. Lethality, likewise, while good, is not as huge as you would think it is. Combat Potency is very powerful and that's basically the main reason why Combat Swords comes out on top for personal DPS; for raid DPS they're about equal.<br>
<br>
Your decision will be partly based on your gear level. In Hyjal Combat vastly outperforms Hemo because Combat Swords' shorter cycles are much better for trash, and less reliance on Rupture as a source of damage (kind of trivial but a factor nevertheless). In addition, Combat scales up better with gear than Hemo does.</div>

		<div id="post_message_609050">Depends on how you define the damage of Hemo.  What keeps it at all close is the debuff, which is a very large chunk of damage that basically doesn't scale at all.  So, setting aside for the moment the scaling of the physical attack itself, your viability to a raid measured in total damage - including the debuff - tends to scale more poorly.<br>
<br>
Now, regarding the scaling of the ability itself: well, the first thing I'd notice is that with Surprise Attacks and Aggression, SS already scales as 1.16xWeapon Damage, whereas Hemo is only 1.1.  So from that already, we'd expect SS to scale better than Hemo.  Even if that *weren't* the case, Combat Potency means you get more SS per unit time than you do Hemo, meaning that if you actually work out the damage per unit time instead of the damage per attack, SS has even more of an advantage.  And finally, Combat Potency assures that SS scales with both Hit and Expertise, while Hemo generally does not.<br>
<br>
So, if you want to be technical, the immediate physical damage of Hemo in a vacuum scales better with gear than the immediate physical damage of a SS.  However, there is more benefit to be gained via talents, so the scaling of a combat SS build is better than that of any Hemo build, just in terms of the damage of the move itself.  When you throw in the fact the Hemo relies on a large chunk of minimally-scaling debuff damage to be competitive, it is pretty clear that Hemo builds scale more poorly with gear than combat builds do.</div>

		<div id="post_message_609224">Right, first time I ask (Took me some time to read it all so that I could see if what I wanted to know was already answered);<br>
<br>
First off, I know that I should probably consult a spreadsheet, but honestly I am more concerned about the mathematical and theoretical reasons for the answer to my question than the straigth DPS answer I get from the spread sheet:<br>
<br>
A rogue stands in the situation where he simply can't seem to get a good sword drop. There's a real flood of daggers, though, and he finds himself with a dagger that is significantly better than the sword he is currently using. Now, how much better than the sword would the dagger need to be in order to let a daggerspec catch up on the dps gain that the rogue would get from using a sword spec, in terms of pure DPS?<br>
I can imagine that it would change depending on gear level (Haste being better for sword procs, maybe?) but I honestly wouldn't mind answers for different gear levels aslong as I could get the reasons and the math behind it with me - I am afraid that making the math here goes above my usual levels but I can usally follow it when it is written down for me</div>

		<div id="post_message_609245">Well, I hate to say it, but: consult your local spreadsheet.<br>
<br>
Fundamentally, the difference between sword spec and dagger spec is very hard to analyze with napkinmath.  You're using attacks with different damage/energy efficiency, different specialization effects (including OH/MH interactions), different proc uptimes - different everything.  It depends on level of gear, level of buff, and so on.  So it's really hard to say "a dagger must be X amount better than your best sword option to be worth using" without coming back to the spreadsheet at some level.<br>
<br>
I did perform an analysis of where the damage difference is coming from, and the answer, as I recall, came down to Murder, Mangle, and OH Sword Spec procs.  Basically, against mobs that are not Murderable, if you don't have a Feral Druid around, Dagger spec does almost identical damage to Fist spec; the only reason Sword spec wins in that case is because your OH sword procs MH attacks via sword spec.<br>
<br>
Now, how big of a difference is this in practice?  Well, the numbers being bounced around at the time were that Vindicator's Brand/Latro's - a combination almost any self-respecting raiding rogue should be able to get - was better than any combination of daggers you could get at the T5 level.  Recent changes have reduced this to some extent, but, for the sake of comparison: with my current gear (mid-high T6), assuming roughly half of targets are Murderable and everything is Manglable (which isn't exactly valid, but it's a decent ballpark figure), with Arena 3 Shanker/Shiv, I do about 1535.5 DPS.  With Arena *2* Slicer/Quickblade, i do 1537.5.  So, Arena 2 swords are comparable to Arena 3 daggers for a T6 rogue.<br>
<br>
Now, if you don't run with a feral druid, and you're in a section of the game where most things aren't Murderable, the gap closes somewhat; in these cases, daggers are somewhat closer.  On the other hand, this is for purely sustained situations; daggers present issues in terms of staying in position (not that swords don't want to attack from behind as well, but you can attack while you're getting there) and having energy cap out (as your energy-expending move is more expensive, your average energy level is higher so you cap out sooner if you have to step out of melee range for whatever reason).  So swords have some intangible benefits as well.<br>
<br>
Fundamentally: it's reasonably easy to see what advantages swords have from a theoretical perspective, but quantifying the difference without a spreadsheet is likely to be very hard if not impossible.</div>

I've heard it said that it's usually worth one rogue to spec Hemo, but at what point does this become true when you have only a few melee members?  My guild may be the exception.  We're currently working on SSC (5/6) and TK (3/4).  Our typical party is thus:<br>
<br>
BM Hunter<br>
Kitty Druid<br>
CSwords Rogue<br>
CSwords Rogue<br>
Either another BM Hunter or a DPS Warrior.<br>
<br>
We have no Enhancement Shaman.  The other two groups are all mage/lock/hunter dps.  So really our only melee dps is some combination of the above plus others in the MT group, about 6 or 7 total including prot warrior(s).  Pets too if they count.  From my reading, this seems lower than what most other rogues that post here have, especially concerning the Enhancement Shaman.  Now, I've plugged my gear into the DPS spreadsheet and as CSwords I come out 1497.78 ideal, but with Hemo I can ideally hit 1527.40, a decent amount of increase, if the Hemo Debuff is checked and DD is set to overall.<br>
<br>
So the question is, will I still be a benefit to the raid considering that there may not be enough melee dps to use up all the Hemo charges, or is the above example enough to do so and realize the dps gain from Hemo?  I'm probably going to test this out tomorrow night and compare WWS's, but I thought I'd get some theoritical feedback as well.</div>

Also, the main metric to go by is "Is the debuff being used up before I refresh it?" (approximately every 4 seconds) - if 3 people can consume the debuff in 4 seconds (unlikely) then you're getting the same raid DPS benefit (within a margin of error, not counting external benefits like TPS, etc) as you would if it was being used up within 1 second of application.</div>

		<div id="post_message_609251">It actually tends not to depend too heavily on the number of physical damage classes in the raid.  It's pretty hard to have a raid wherein the charges will *not* all be used fairly consistently.  As long as you're careful to not apply too close together on a regular basis, you yourself will likely use almost half the charges yourself; as long as there's a tank and one other melee DPS, you'll be using almost all the charges.  By the time you're using 2 other melee DPS, the issue is basically gone.<br>
<br>
The real dependency for the value of Hemo is itemization level; since Combat Swords (CS) scales better than Tri-spec hemo (TSH), the viability depends on where on that scaling curve you are.  If you're at the T4 level of itemization, TSH is pretty strong; by end-T6, it's pretty much dead.  Based on your armory, you appear to be at T4/Low-T5 itemization, so I would say that having 1 TSH rogue probably does make sense from a raid DPS perspective.  To figure it out in more details, I would consult the spreadsheets.</div>

</div>I didn't even realize Hunter attacks use Hemo charges.  My bad.  I guess I need to read the tooltip better.  That does change it a bit.  Typically we have 3 hunters, 2 rogues, 2 feral druids, a ret pally, and 2 - 3 tanks depending on the encounter.  So we have anywhere from 9 to 11 people that would use those charges within a 4 minute window.  I'd imagine that that number would be enough to use the charges fast enough.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the clarification.</div>

		<div id="post_message_609374">I've read through some of the infractions on this site and wanted to start of by apologizing for my spelling and grammar; neither of which are too good. <br>
<br>
I've been reading through a lot of the rogue material and have a few questions that I hope some don't mind answering for me. After looking at them I realized they aren't as important as I thought. Most seem to just be nit picking type questions that were bugging me, as most of my questions were answered in this thread. Also I would like to apologize if these questions were covered else where but in threads that are often lengthy I may have missed the answers (but I did try to find them).<br>
<br>
1.) Energy Regen: This may actually be a pretty stupid question but does spamming any attack, let’s say sinister strike slow down your energy regen or will it still regen at the 2 sec rate. I know with casters they have a certain mana regen when casting and then one when not casting. <br>
<br>
If it does regen at the same rate no matter what (not counting talents such as AR) then that leads me to my next question.<br>
<br>
2.) EW: Am I missing the main point of the energy watch mod? When I try to use it I find myself staring to much at it and it ticks so fast I'm not sure how anyone can keep up with the count. It seems like you should just spam whatever attack and build up to the required number of combo points for your cycle, instead of watching or counting your energy regen. <br>
<br>
3.) Trash Mobs: When trash will die quickly what would be the correct way of opening. My garrotes seem to never get to run their full course and using cheap shot seems like it might hinder the tank from generating rage as efficient during those seconds the mob is stunned. Would it be better to run up to the target and sinister strike, followed by SnD, and then finish out the cycle? <br>
<br>
4.) Certain Math: In *general* where does certain math come from that's not on the tool tips. For example from reading info on this forum, I now know that a 5cp rupture does 1000 damage + 24% of your AP for 35 energy, or 40 damage plus 0.96% of your AP per energy. The tool tips only says *increased by your attack power*. So is it a matter of people doing extensive calculations to figure out the % of your AP on this attack or is there another resource/mod, in game feature etc that tells you these numbers?<br>
<br>
5.) My last question had to do with trouble I was having with a macro to eliminate the red error messages you receive when a ability isn't ready. I recently did a reinstall and lost all of my macros so I don't have the code that was giving me the problem. In a nut shell I basically was trying make a macro that every time I used sinister strike it would check to see if trinket was up and if so then use it. I was able to get it to work but I was also getting a constant flow of error messages from spamming it that the trinket wasn’t ready. A friend helped me clear the message but then the macro was no longer using my trinket. <br>
<br>
Sorry if the wording on these questions made y'all cringe but as I stated at the beginning my grammar and spelling aren't so good.</div>

</div>1) Energy regen is constant.  It never changes.  It's always 20 energy every 2 seconds (except during AR).<br>
2) My understanding of energy watch mods is that they're mainly for timing openers in, like, pvp scenarios.  If you open on someone right before a tick, you basically have 20 extra energy to combo them with.<br>
3) I usually open with Sinister Strike, myself.  In 5/10 mans, Cheap Shot is an option, but for 25-man raiding I think SS is usually the way to go.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">This may not be the case any more, but there have definitely been times that I have noticed a gain of 21-22 energy per tick.  However, they were both with a druid, and both pre-2.0.  In one case I was watching a friend farm in EPL while waiting to get into Naxx, and he had SCT reporting his normal energy gains.  They were consistently 21-22.  I also remember from playing my own druid with energy numbers displayed that sometimes I would get more than 20 energy in a tick.<br>
<br>
In both of these cases, I attributed it to the server being overloaded.  You are supposed to regenerate 10 energy per second.  My theory was that if the server couldn't keep up with having a regen tick every 2 seconds and was having to delay them, it would still credit you with the appropriate amount of energy if it took 2.1 or 2.2 seconds.  Given that I tended to experience the above behavior when the server felt a little more sluggish than normal, and really having no other way to interpret what I saw, I was fairly sure it was a reasonable explanation.  And I forgot all about it until I read the last few posts.</div>

	</tr>
	</table>
</div>Did I miss an answer to this?  I have definitely seen that extra 1 or 2 energy pop up from time to time (usually a 41 or 42 on the energy bar)--is lag to blame?  Sinister strike/rupture/S&amp;D cost 40/25/25 and CP adds 15 so our energy numbers should always end in 0 or 5.<br>
<br>
Another explanation would be the use of shiv--with Latro's, it costs 34 energy (20 + 10*weapon speed).  Start somewhere mid-cycle with 40 energy, proc CP to get to 55, Shiv to drop to 21, energy tick to 41, and so on...although I never shiv, so I don't think that's the case for me.</div>

		<div id="post_message_609418">I believe that's caused by client-side lag.  That is, you still gain 10 energy per second on average, but your client doesn't update until 2.1 seconds since the last tick, so you get 21 energy.  I know during the AQ event I was getting really irregular ticks - some as large as 30 or so - and I was lagging extremely badly at the time, which is why I theorize this.  However, that was a while ago, so it might have changed since.</div>

</div>Haste is, in it's own right, a fairly good stat.  The problem is that as far as I can tell, it's an expensive stat from an item budget perspective (or perhaps everything with it is just itemized poorly), so passive haste items are rarely notably good for where they drop.<br>
<br>
In terms of figuring out the actual value of some of the ZA/Badge items, your best bet is probably one of the spreadsheets.  As a rough approximation for the items you mentioned: Heartless + Akil'zon's Talonblade are better than any swords you can get from pre-25 man raiding, but are behind all 25-man raiding swords, as well as Arena season 2+3 gear.  Shallow-Grave trousers are competitive with the best things you can get pre-T6.  Trickster's Stickyfinger's are better than anything in T4 but worse than everything in T5.<br>
<br>
For more precise answers, grab a spreadsheet, punch in your gear, and see how the various items compare.</div>

</div>I tend to open with Shiv.  Yes, it's lower damage than SS, but in context that just means there's less chance of getting aggro before it's established.  It also gets your DP stack started, which means you have a better chance of finishing up with a big Envenom.  Remember, Eviscerate is only better than Envenom if the DP stack has time to tick.  On trash, that's generally not the case, and Rupture won't tick out either, so Envenom is actually the finisher of choice.  <br>
<br>
The alternative is to put IP instead of DP, start with SS and finish with Eviscerate.  Not sure how much if any difference that makes, but it's a royal pain to have to swap poisons from IP to DP and back before and after every boss fight, which is why I just roll with DP and use Envenom on trash.<br>
<br>
I wonder if that's worth actually theorycrafting out?  Let's assume you have time for exactly one big finisher.<br>
<br>
Is it better to do:<br>
<br>
(Shiv) / S'n'D 1 point / (SS spam) / Envenom 5 point - assumes DP on OH<br>
<br>
or<br>
<br>
(SS) / S'n'D' 1 point / (SS spam) / Eviscerate 5 point - assumes IP on OH<br>
<br>
?<br>
<br>
<br>
Of course, theorycrafting extreme trash DPS may not be the most fruitful use of our time, but it's something to do while waiting for news about itemisation / mechanics changes.  As an aside, in terms of pure e-peen, timing a Blade Flurry correctly so you can double up a 5k Envenom crit takes a lot of beating.</div>

Fundamentally, the difference between sword spec and dagger spec is very hard to analyze with napkinmath.  You're using attacks with different damage/energy efficiency, different specialization effects (including OH/MH interactions), different proc uptimes - different everything.  It depends on level of gear, level of buff, and so on.  So it's really hard to say "a dagger must be X amount better than your best sword option to be worth using" without coming back to the spreadsheet at some level.<br>
<br>
I did perform an analysis of where the damage difference is coming from, and the answer, as I recall, came down to Murder, Mangle, and OH Sword Spec procs.  Basically, against mobs that are not Murderable, if you don't have a Feral Druid around, Dagger spec does almost identical damage to Fist spec; the only reason Sword spec wins in that case is because your OH sword procs MH attacks via sword spec.<br>
<br>
Now, how big of a difference is this in practice?  Well, the numbers being bounced around at the time were that Vindicator's Brand/Latro's - a combination almost any self-respecting raiding rogue should be able to get - was better than any combination of daggers you could get at the T5 level.  Recent changes have reduced this to some extent, but, for the sake of comparison: with my current gear (mid-high T6), assuming roughly half of targets are Murderable and everything is Manglable (which isn't exactly valid, but it's a decent ballpark figure), with Arena 3 Shanker/Shiv, I do about 1535.5 DPS.  With Arena *2* Slicer/Quickblade, i do 1537.5.  So, Arena 2 swords are comparable to Arena 3 daggers for a T6 rogue.<br>
<br>
Now, if you don't run with a feral druid, and you're in a section of the game where most things aren't Murderable, the gap closes somewhat; in these cases, daggers are somewhat closer.  On the other hand, this is for purely sustained situations; daggers present issues in terms of staying in position (not that swords don't want to attack from behind as well, but you can attack while you're getting there) and having energy cap out (as your energy-expending move is more expensive, your average energy level is higher so you cap out sooner if you have to step out of melee range for whatever reason).  So swords have some intangible benefits as well.<br>
<br>
Fundamentally: it's reasonably easy to see what advantages swords have from a theoretical perspective, but quantifying the difference without a spreadsheet is likely to be very hard if not impossible.</div>

</div>Thank you, I did, and got a small difference of 2 DPS from going from a lower itemlevel sword to dagger, so I will take it that I will see an actual increase in DPS due to the greater margin of errors allowed by swords (If I remember correct the spread sheet can't figure out how good or bad I perform myself)<br>
Thank you, anyhow, for the information of what would influence it</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Again, I apologize for my poor math skills.  I am combat daggers and 2 pieces of T4, my raid team is just now progressing into SSC/TK.  I am finding that for trash pulls, the hunters and sometimes mages are topping the rogues in dps.  I know part of this is that these are highly mobile pulls and while the hunters/mages can just stand still and keep dpsing, the rogues have to chase down the mob to start dpsing.  However, I want to see if the rotation I am using on trash can be tinkered with to increase that damage.  One of the biggest problems is that the mob will almost always die before I can get a 3CP rupture on the mob or if I get the rupture on the mob, before the rupture ticks through.  So I'm wondering for trash mobs, would it be better to simply get SnD up constantly and just backstab until the mob is almost dead, use SnD again so that it is up for the next mob in the pack and so forth?  Or would it be better to switch to a 1CP SnD/3CP Evis for the mobs, even though evis does less dmg/energy than rupture, it is an instant dmg rather than a dot.  Or is there a 3rd method I'm missing?  I know there are formulas here that go over some of this, but it really is another language to me though I have tried to work it through myself.  I usually open up on the pull with either cheap shot if they are stunnable and I get 2 CPs right off the bat or with ambush if they aren't stunnable.  Then by making sure SnD is up when the first mob dies, I can move to the next one to backstab and don't have to shiv or SS to get another point up.  As combat daggers, I am working hard to never have to hit SS or shiv, except in certain fights where it is almost impossible to get a combat point up without using them.  I have been currently just keeping SnD up and backstabbing the trash mobs otherwise.  But I know this wastes some dmg output because sometimes SnD still has about 10sec on it when the trash mob is about to die, but I will have 3 or 4 CP on it and will hit SnD to use them up so that I will still have SnD up for the next mob in the pull.<br>
<br>
Also, on a side note, someone talked about not poisoning our MH weapon because we should have a shammy with WF up.  While we do have shamans in our raids most nights, one of our MTs is a feral druid and so we almost never get WF over Grace of Air.  So I do keep up poisons on both MH/OH.  I usually put deadly on MH and instant on OH.  However, that does mean mangle is generally on the target.  When we do get lucky enough to get WF, then I just put deadly on my OH.  But the rogues really don't get much say in how parties are set up or what shaman totems we get.</div>

	</table>
</div>So basically.. your combat daggers, have a crap group and your guild isn't organizing trash well (spreading stuff way out making the melee run around).  Then on top of this, you're trying to use a finisher which takes 12 seconds to do its damage on a mob that probably dies in 10-15 seconds.. most of which is spend getting the combo points to do said finisher.<br>
<br>
The only advice I can really give is that Backstab is better dmg per energy than Evis/Envenom until about 4 or 5 combo points.  Just spam backstab and SnD, don't worry about Evis/Envenom/Rupture on trash really.  Generally IP MH, DP OH is the more accepted method of doing poisons.  After counting in yellow attacks, your MH and OH hit the boss nearly the same amount of times per unit of time, so deadly OH in case you ever feel like shiv'ing to force it on or just so you don't have to switch poisons when you DO get a shaman.<br>
<br>
Rogue dps scales immensely with buffs.  I've done fights where I am literally the ONLY melee in the raid, aside from the tanks.  I've also done raids with Imp Battle shout + Solarian, Enhance sham, Blood Frenzy, Ret pally, Survival hunter, feral druid, CoR, imp BoM, BoK, agi scroll, hit food, flask, etc.  Your dps can more than double just based on buffs.. hell you mentioned having a feral MT - do you have a warrior sundering the mobs your killing for trash?  That alone is a 20-25% dps boost.</div>

		<div id="post_message_609991">Yea, you're on the right track with your "trash theory" for lack of a better term. Certain specs do better over long periods of time (Combat daggers, Affliction warlocks, etc) when they don't have a lot of spiky, burst damage. However, there's no real "correct" cycle you should be using. It will always depend on the duration of the mob, and how hard the DPS in your guild is trying on those trash pulls. Just use your best judgement to know how to sneak the most damage in that you possibly can. <br>
<br>
One thing to think about is the DPE of Eviscerate vs. Backstab. Sure you can throw a 2 or 3 point Eviscerate on that mob before it dies, but if RS doesn't proc, that could mean a WHOLE bunch of auto-attacking time on the next mob. But it seems you're already thinking about things like this, so keep fiddling around with it and you'll figure out what works best for you.<br>
<br>
As for your poisons, I believe you have them backwards. If you have no Windfury, you'd want Instant on your main hand, and Deadly on your off hand.</div>

<br>
As a general rule of thumb (found in various posts on this forum), you should avoid using Rupture on trash pulls for the reasons you outline.  Therefore your only real options left are Evis or Envenom.  I typically stick with Evis but there's a strong argument to burn your DP ticks with Envenom if you can time it right (near mob death).  <br>
<br>
Also I tend to use the 20% mob health mark as an indicator when to start burning off my last remaining CPs.  There just isn't enough time left in the battle to guarantee those CPs will be around much longer, so I stop trying to build up more and just spend spend spend.  I occasionally burn them on extending my SnD (if additonal trash is in the queue), but it all depends on how many additional trash mobs are up and how close they are to me (the farther away, the more SnD is wasted in travel).  <br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Haste is, in it's own right, a fairly good stat.  The problem is that as far as I can tell, it's an expensive stat from an item budget perspective (or perhaps everything with it is just itemized poorly), so passive haste items are rarely notably good for where they drop.<br>
<br>
In terms of figuring out the actual value of some of the ZA/Badge items, your best bet is probably one of the spreadsheets.  As a rough approximation for the items you mentioned: Heartless + Akil'zon's Talonblade are better than any swords you can get from pre-25 man raiding, but are behind all 25-man raiding swords, as well as Arena season 2+3 gear.  Shallow-Grave trousers are competitive with the best things you can get pre-T6.  Trickster's Stickyfinger's are better than anything in T4 but worse than everything in T5.<br>
<br>
For more precise answers, grab a spreadsheet, punch in your gear, and see how the various items compare.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</div>Haste appears to have the exact same cost as any other stat (other then AP, Stam or -Armor).  Compare the T4 Pants to the Badge one:<br>
T4 Lv 120:<br>
+43 Agility<br>
+40 Stamina<br>
Equip: Improves hit rating by 26 (1.65% @ L70).<br>
Equip: Increases attack power by 84.<br>
<br>
<br>
Badge Lv 128:<br>
+45 Agility<br>
+46 Stamina<br>
Equip: Improves haste rating by 30 (1.9% @ L70).<br>
Equip: Increases attack power by 92.<br>
<br>
+2 Agi<br>
+6 Stam<br>
+8 AP <br>
<br>
30 Haste instead of 26 Hit.  On a 1 for 1 Basis, the badge ones should win out every time which the spreadsheet bears out (10 DPS advantage with the gear set I used).  However, the 2 piece T4 out does that if you have another piece you are already wearing.  <br>
<br>
And yes, generally every item with haste is poorly itemized compared to the alternative due to one factor: SOCKETS.<br>
-Slayers Shoulders (2 Sockets) &gt; Swiftstrike Shoulders (0 Sockets) &gt; Other Non-Set Shoulders (0 Sockets)<br>
-Insidious Bands (1 Socket) &gt; Deadly Cuffs (0 Sockets) &gt; Swiftstrike Bracers (0 Socket)<br>
<br>
The same is true with the melee haste gloves compared to the T6 ones, as well as almost any other haste item.  There is a single item with haste and sockets to my knowledge and the fact that sockets are budgeted at 6 stat points, and in T6 you get 10, means that you are getting anywhere from 4-12 more points on socketed gear then on unsocketed.<br>
<br>
I fully expect Sunwell to have leather gear with expertise, hit and haste, since they are the best stats for us, and get rid of the crit that they keep trying to shove down our throats (with the daggers that we don't want).</div>

</div>The general rule of thumb is that physical DPS scales with buffs better than caster DPS. Why? Almost every physical DPS buffs directly increase damage (besides an obvious few). We get (usually at least some of) Might, GoA, SoE, WF, Leader of the Pack, Imp Faerie Fire, Battle Shout, TSA, Imp Hunter's Mark/Hunter's Mark, Exp. Weakness, Ferocious Inspiration, Sunder Armor, Curse of Recklessness, etc. (might have missed some).<br>
<br>
On the other hand, casters get Totem of Wrath/WoA (both of which are worse than WF), Moonkin Aura, Ferocious Inspiration, Misery, CoE/CoS (might have missed some again).<br>
<br>
Both physical and casters get Gift and Kings but, again, physical DPS gains more from it with AP gains and less of agility equating to crit than intellect. <br>
<br>
To sum up, more physical dps buffs directly increase damage; more caster buffs (Wisdom, VT, etc) increase longevity rather than directly upping damage. <br>
<br>
It should be noted however, that just like adding a fully-talented and Sapphire'd BS (470 AP) is huge in terms of buffing your DPS (making up for a massive amount of gear upgrades), casters gain a lot, from, say, a Wrath of Air totem, which is equivalent to a good many gear pieces.</div>

		<div id="post_message_611740">Hello this is my first post on EJ!<br>
<br>
First off this is a great post, i have used it, to try and maximize my rogues dps, but i have found myself in a situation where i cannot find the answer on how to up my DPS.<br>
<br>
For a long time i had been PvE'ing with the Season 3 Maces, and while the maces have an impressive 103 dps, the proc effect from Swords is sorely missed, and i figured that might be what caused my somewhat unimpressive raid dps.<br>
<br>
So i studied this thread and i figured getting season 3 offhand sword and then mixing it up with a Combat Mace MH/sword OF hybrid spec would be my best bet to upping DPS so i got a 16/45/0 build and went into SSC.<br>
<br>
The DPS is indeed good, i think it improved, but im still not doing good enough dps.<br>
<br>
So i have come here in the hopes, that someone could advice me, on what a smart move would be to up PvE Dps.<br>
<br>
I used my last arena points on the Season 3 offhand sword.<br>
<br>
What im considering is, would replacing Season 3 MH Mace, with Talon of Azshara or Heartless, and going Full Combat swords, be an overall DPS Upgrade, despite the individual MH weapon DPS downgrade?<br>
<br>
I tried to use the dps spreadsheet but it didnt work out.<br>
<br>
Heres my armory - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302204050/http://eu.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Karazhan&amp;n=Herreth" target="_blank">http://eu.wowarmory.com/character-sh...zhan&amp;n=Herreth</a><br>
<br>
I tried hard to work out how to Up my PvE Dps, but i just dont know.<br>
<br>
Hope someone with Sword spec experience can help me out</div>

</div>i tried to use the spreadsheet but i couldnt make it work, i also wrote that in my post.<br>
<br>
I will try again i guess.<br>
<br>
I ran the spreadsheet, then when i changed talent build i got an error message saying "Macros are disabled because the security level is set too high and needs a signed publisher".<br>
<br>
I then lowered security level, and tried changing talent build again, i got a Microsoft Visual basic "Compile error; cannot find project or library" which opened up a window that looked like a script to me.<br>
<br>
Ill try tinkering around more with it.</div>

</div>Its a simple question of whether a 6 DPS individual weapon downgrade, and going from mace+sword combat to sword+sword is an overall upgrade, or an overall downgrade.<br>
<br>
In other words whether the invidual dps makes up less than the specialization dps will. Id say that is rogue mechanics, and not a case of heres my gear.<br>

My gut would be to say that switching from Hybrid Mace/Sword to Sword/Sword is enough of an upgrade to warrant the loss of 6 DPS on the MH, but not necessarily 6 DPS plus a reallocation of stats.

</div>To be perfectly honest, if you don't like your dps comparatively, I'd think it is something other than the weapon choice or spec in this case.  Combat Maces are still pretty competitive.  I don't think the weapon difference is going to mean a lot especially given that you'd have to downgrade to a sword.  Sounds like you think you should be doing a lot more dps and just aren't.<br>
<br>
What I'd be looking for...<br>
From a personal perspective...<br>
1)  Are you keeping SnD up all the time?<br>
2)  Are you letting SnD run it's course, not preempting it?<br>
3)  Are you potting, getting your food buffs, etc.?<br>
4)  Are you getting to the mobs in a timely manner (know where they are getting tanked)?<br>
5)  Are you attacking from behind?  Just because Maces are non-positional doesn't mean you don't lose a ton of dps by attacking from the front because of parries.<br>
6)  Are you running good cycles?  Not maxing out energy.<br>
7)  Are you dying prematurely?<br>
<br>
From a raid perspective...<br>
1)  Are you getting your buffs?<br>
2)  Are you in a group that enhances your DPS (Shaman for WF or GoA; Warrior for Battle Shout)<br>
3)  Are the people in your group that give you your buffs dying or staying in range?<br>
4)  Is your role as a Rogue one where you maximize DPS?  I.E. Your job isn't stunlock.<br>
5)  Is Sunder staying up on the mob?<br>
6)  Is the fight good for melee DPS?  High movement fights and fights where you need to move in and out a lot do not favor rogues for min/maxing.<br>
<br>
I'm just saying that there are a number of other factors which factor in to whether one is achieving the DPS they expect beyond minor gear choices.</div>

</div>This is very true dontmindme! The reason i have come here is that my guild has started doing Lady Vashj, and my Dps on her was not quite as good as i had hoped. By no means was my Dps bad, i was 3-4, behind 2 warlocks and a hunter.<br>
<br>
In phase 2 we put rogues on elementals so we have to move alot and this surely does take quite alot of dps away.<br>
<br>
I do try to keep slice and dice up running always, and im wearing t4 2 piece bonus in order to help with it as well.<br>
<br>
So yeah it is very true that in order to fully maximize damage potential, i should probably also be looking at a more fair fight (where are those in SSC! <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304081330im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/biggrin.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":D" class="inlineimg"> ?).<br>
<br>
The spreadsheets i must say, have truly been a great assistance, and i have learned alot about how i could up my raid dps, thank you very much for helping out, and have a good day</div>

</div>The radius of Blade Flurry is very small. I haven't tested it, but from observation it appears that the 2nd target must also be in your melee range. But this doesn't seem to be the only limitation as I've frequently had two mobs attacking me and BF doesn't work until I try to reposition them. My guess is that the two mobs both have to be in melee range of each other, but I'm not entirely sure.<br>
<br>
It's actually weird that its range is so small because on my druid I can Swipe in bear form up to 3 mobs, and while the main target must be within melee range, the other 2 targets can be well out of my melee range (at least 10 yards), so the mechanic seems to be different between the two.<br>
<br>
As already mentioned, you can't hit 3 targets at once. Reread the tooltip. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304081330im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":)" class="inlineimg"><br>
<br>
All instant damage you deal will also affect the second target, but I'm not actually sure if DOTs (rupture, deadly poison) also carry over or not, although I am pretty sure instant poison does. I really have not specced deep Combat very often.<br>
<br>
One more thing to notice about BF is that armor mitigation is calculated independently for each target. If your main target is a rogue and you hit him for 1k, and if your second target is a bear druid for example, he isn't going to take the full 1k because he has more armor.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">BF hits just 1 additional Mob (It also says so in the tooltip). <br>
<br>
And it hits the additional Mob for <i>exactly</i> the same  amount of damage as your main target. If your Eviscerate crit's for lets say 2k, the second mob is hit by BF also for 2k damage.<br>
<br>
Gathering more than 2 Mobs in Melee range does not increase your damage from BF.<br>
<br>
Also, afaik, BF attacks cannot proc. Poison, Mongoose etc.</div>

</div>This is not entirely true. Blade Flurry used to work like this if I recall correctly, hitting both mobs for the exact same damage, but it was changed quite a while ago to apply the secondary target's armour reduction to the BF damage instead of the primary target's. Everything else is correct I believe, though for some reason Envenom works with BF though poisons do not. Blade Flurry actually has a whole bunch of strange quirks about it; it might be interesting to compile a list of them.<br>
<br>
edit: wow, I'm slow in responding, but I wanted to do a test to make sure I wasn't remembering the mechanics wrongly.</div>

If you are searching for a way to maximize your damage output in raids - you have found the right place to get information on that.<br>
If you came to get suggestions on how to keep your subtlety spec and still do decent raid damage - forget about it.<br>
<br>
You have to make a decision: drop subtlety, spec combat(-daggers/-swords/-fists) and become awesome in PvE damage  OR keep your subtlety and accept that even BM-hunters and icemages will outdamage you in any given raid situation.<br>
<br>
Reading and following the guide in the first post of this thread (that contains everything you need to know in order to be a good rogue for your raid) will help you if you decide for a raid-spec.<br>
<br>
And while it may seem a big loss to give up shadowstep, its use in PvE really is not essential. On the other hand you can still respec to subtlety for PvP and fun over the weekend as many rogues do. <br>
<br>
Hope I could help!</div>

</div>Shadowstep, yes. But, the Subtlety may not. <br>
<br>
Contrary to what Tobesbote said, you aren't limited to Combat for a reasonable amount of damage output. If you want the absolute highest damage potential, then you'd be looking at swords. But, as you said that you aren't looking for drastic play-style changes, I'd suggest you look into Mutilate (41/20/0 or 43/0/18). <br>
<br>
Technically Combat daggers will outdamage Mutilate when all things are equal. However, with as short as most fights are in Kara, the high burst potential of Mutilate will really come through for you, and there are very few mobs that are immune to poisons (Curator, Arcane Guardians, etc). <br>
<br>
Mutilate takes a while to learn though if you're new to it. So be patient, take the time to read through some of the huge discussions here about DPS cycles, gear choices, spec choices, etc and I think you'll be pleased with what you find. <br>

</div>If you haven't downloaded the MSXML library that is also available at the download site.  The other question to ask...can you see your profile if you use your web-browser.  If it doesn't load up (sometimes it doesn't), the Spreadsheet can't find it either.  Of course, the Import function is rather new, so manually inputting your items is what everyone basically had to do until very recently.</div>

This works out for 70 and up fairly easily, giving us a hit cap of 300 for the same level mob (24% - 5% (for 5/5 precision) to get 19% miss.  300/15.77 = 19.02%).<br>
<br>
For a level 67 mob:<br>
<br>
24% + (335 - 350) * .1% = 23.99%<br>
<br>
For a level 50 mob:<br>
<br>
24% + (250 - 350) * .1% = 23.9%<br>

For a level 1 mob:<br>
<br>
24% + (5 - 350) * .1% = 23.67%<br>

Well I bit the bullet and, after due consideration of the comments of posters here, I decided to try Combat Daggers.  I went vanilla for the build suggest at the front of this thread 15/41/5  and had about 10 minutes practice on undeads, vultures and Ogres on my way into Kara as a late sub for a no-show.  (I also got the right RED gem...expensive mistake, ouch)<br>
<br>
Bingo!  The game play is easy, the cooldowns on the ss and shiv are such that, as well as playing keepie uppie with SnD<br>
I could keep a pretty constant stream of specials going in.  I love blade flurry for the AOE bits... stops the mages collecting all the dps <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304081330im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":)" class="inlineimg">  My little dps mater (30 sec snap shot) showed an average more than 80 better than before but more importantly I finished top of the dps tree... which got our mages thinking I can tell ya!<br>
<br>
I even popped a quick BM heroic before bed and dropped a nice purple gem with agility and to hit buffs and Lantro's sword for a 2nd time!  So if I go the whole hog and do combat swords I could have a matching set... what do you think?<br>
<br>
Thanks for help, advice and kick in backside that was much appreciated.<br>
<br>
[ I realised I hadn't mentioned about mutilate, but having tried and enjoyed this respecc, I will be eager to try others and see which suits me best. Mutilate sounds more complicated and I guess it is a confidence thing too... but appreciated the answer]<br>

It was generally assumed (and may be verified with teste on Blasted Lands mobs; cant remenber anymore ) that it applies to mobs below your level as well.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">This works out for 70 and up fairly easily, giving us a hit cap of 300 for the same level mob (24% - 5% (for 5/5 precision) to get 19% miss.  300/15.77 = 19.02%).<br>
<br>
For a level 67 mob:<br>
<br>
24% + (335 - 350) * .1% = 23.99%</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</div>You made a small mistake. The formula should be read like this:<br>
{24 + (mob defence skill - your weaponskill) * 0.1} %<br>
that gives for lvl 67<br>
24 - 15*0.1 = 22.5 %<br>
<br>
For a level 1 mob you cant miss; the above formula gives about -10% misschance.<br>
Of course nobody knows if the formula really can be applied to such a big leveldifference.</div>

</div>OK, first thing is that if you are using daggers you should never be using Sinister Strike.  Get behind the mob and use backstab.  Sinister Strike is a skill that's used with slow, hard-hitting weapons.  Next, you shouldn't generally shiv in PvE content.  Shiv is a very low-damage move whose only benefit is that it applies poison.  Its main use is in PvP combat, to make sure you get crippling poison (or wounding poison etc.) onto an opponent.<br>
 <br>
For combat daggers, you should use backstab to build combo points, keep SnD running, and spend any extra energy / combo points on Rupture.  Combat swords/fists/maces are the same, except you use Sinister Strike rather than backstab.<br>

</div>That would be a very very bad idea, for much the same reason.  Latro's is an extremely fast sword (fastest in the game, in fact).  You use it in your offhand so as to get lots of poison procs and combat potency procs.  However, because it is fast, the damage <i>per hit</i> is low, which means the Sinister Strike damage will also be low.  For combat swords/fists/maces, you want the slowest main hand weapon you can get and the fastest offhand weapon you can get.  It's as simple as that.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>hehe, thats true. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080330030617im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":)" class="inlineimg"><br>
<br>
Backstab does not have a cooldown. its practically the only style you want to use your energy with.<br>
You start the fight with Ambush/Cheapshot, SnD and start building combopoints with backstab. As soon as SnD runs out (you should have built 4-5 combo points by then) you refresh it. Your main intention is to keep SnD up and running.   Try that for a few times and you will notice that you generate more combo points than needed to keep up SnD. For those combo points rupture is the best option to use them with. You just have to try it out and play with it. You will get good at it very fast. The better you get at managing your combopoints the more damage you will be able to do.<br>
<br>
It can be confusing but I also want to tell you: try to keep up SnD using as few combopoints as possible. The first combopoint spent on SnD gives you 13 seconds. The second-fifth combo points only add 4.<br>
Your goal is a 3s/5s/5r cycle, but its never predictable how that will work out considering combat potency. Keeping up SnD will do it for now. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080330030617im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/biggrin.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":D" class="inlineimg"><br>

As a note though. Even when figuring in BoK +20 hit food will probably still benefit you more than agility food. For me it's a 3 DPS diffrence over 20 agi last time I checked.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Really though, how many paladins do you see running around with 280 hit rating? <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080330030617im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/wink.gif" border="0" alt="" title=";)" class="inlineimg"></div>

<br>
Following up on the missrate.<br>
If the formula is correct for mobs below your level you can derive this formula for the required hitrating to never miss<br>
a mob (assuming 5% precision and dualwielding)<br>
hitrating &gt;= 205/13 *(moblevel/2 -16).<br>
<br>
So with your 280 hitrating you never miss mobs below lvl 68 and to never miss a lvl 57 mob requires only<br>
190 hitrating.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Actually, you're better off using Garrote, or not using Stealth at all. Stealth just slows you down, and means you take even longer to get to the mob. On top of that, many mobs in Kara and above are immune to Cheap Shot, and an untimely Ambush crit can have you one-shotted and dead on the floor. <br>
<br>
Garrote ignores armor, and it's more evenly-spread threat. So it's the best opener if you decide to Stealth. If not, just hit a Backstab and get Slice and Dice running as quickly as possible. <br>
<br>
Also some important nuggets:<br>
<br>
Slice and Dice is more important than Rupture! As Combat daggers, at least 60% of your damage should be white (possibly more), and Slice and Dice is a big contributor to that. Rupture is only in the DPS cycle to burn extra combo points between Slice and Dice refreshes. <br>
<br>
Why Rupture? Well, for the same reason that you want to use Garrote over Ambush. It's a cheap finisher that ignores armor, and won't cause threat spikes that can get you killed. Also note that a 3cp Rupture and a 5cp rupture both receive the same AP bonus. The only difference is that a 5cp Rupture lasts longer (but still does the same DPS). <br>
<br>
For that reason, you can also find some Combat dagger rogues using a 1s/3r cycle. It's easy to maintain and manage, and the only downside is that you'll probably see a lot less returns from Relentless Strikes (which makes 3s/5s/5r better).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
Backstab does not have a cooldown. its practically the only style you want to use your energy with.<br>
You start the fight with Ambush/Cheapshot, SnD and start building combopoints with backstab. As soon as SnD runs out (you should have built 4-5 combo points by then) you refresh it. Your main intention is to keep SnD up and running.   Try that for a few times and you will notice that you generate more combo points than needed to keep up SnD. For those combo points rupture is the best option to use them with. You just have to try it out and play with it. You will get good at it very fast. The better you get at managing your combopoints the more damage you will be able to do.<br>
<br>
It can be confusing but I also want to tell you: try to keep up SnD using as few combopoints as possible. The first combopoint spent on SnD gives you 13 seconds. The second-fifth combo points only add 4.<br>
Your goal is a 3s/5s/5r cycle, but its never predictable how that will work out considering combat potency. Keeping up SnD will do it for now. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080330030617im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/biggrin.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":D" class="inlineimg"><br>

</div>I'd say this depends.  Hit rating is generally better, but I think it depends on your gear level.  For a while, in a mix of kara gear and some trickle-down crafted epics, the spreadsheet had agility as worth more than hit for me, and I'm well under the hit-cap.  With my current gear, and the buffs I can expect when I run kara, 1 hit is worth 1.04 agility...not a big difference.<br>
<br>
If you are 25-man raiding, and can expect full buffs (things like windfury, which I've had for a total of 1 five-man instance lol), I don't doubt your numbers.  But at lower gear levels...I'd say check the sheet.  Also, agility offers side benefits...added armor and more importantly, dodge.  Sure in a 25 man raid a rogue probably never gets hit.  But in 5 mans I take hits from time to time, and I still run heroics now and again, and more dodge is nice for pvp.<br>
<br>
True I have gemmed for hit...but I wouldn't hold it against someone to gem for agility.  Depending on their gear, it could even be a DPS improvement.  In fact, I would imagine for most rogues at my gear level and below that agility may be better than hit...or at least a wash.  In which case the side-benefits from agility make it better.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Does it matter?  Hit is just a number.  DPS is what matters.  Having 363 hit and 1500 AP would be pretty dumb.  Balance your stats.  In the case of gemming, hit is *generally* the best stat for *most* rogues.  For gearing though, picking a piece just because it has hit is retarded.  Hit is a good stat - but thats all it is, a stat.  Multiply your hit, haste, ap, arm pen, haste, crit, etc to get a more important number.<br>
<br>
Note - get a helm w/ a Meta slot and use RED.  Enchant your OH.  Why did you socket a purple into your Nynjah boots.. you dropped 4 agi/hit to get the 3-hit socket bonus.  Would of been better off ignoring the socket bonus.  Similar for the chest/helm, although you can justify 2 blues for a RED meta.. not that you have one.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

It can be a powerful stat, but (no offense) your question kinda indicates that you don't really have a clue how it works. <br>
<br>
Long story short, the more armor a mob/player has, the less effective it becomes. Therefore, having passive ArP against a mob with 5 Sunders on it can be pretty powerful. Likewise if you take Improved Expose Armor and frequently run with a paladin or druid tank. However, against high-armor targets, it makes very little difference.<br>
<br>
The amount of actual DPS you gain is correlated to how much armor your target has. There is plenty of discussion on this if you search the forums.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Regarding Mongoose and Executioner Enchants:<br>
<br>
Both Mongoose and Executioner enchants are very powerful for rogues.  In general they are very close to one another in value, and the only thing you can really do wrong is to enchant both MH and OH with Executioner - as the added benefit from a 2nd Executioner enchant is much less, due to stacking issues.  However, as a guideline, according to the best information that we have available, here are some recommendations.  These recommendations are for Combat Spec'd rogues.<br>
<br>
Karazhan/T4 geared rogue: Mongoose on both hands<br>
T5 gear: Executioner or Mongoose MH (very close in value), Mongoose on offhand<br>
T6 gear: Executioner MH, Mongoose OH</div>

If your guild competes for WWS clears, that's one thing, but most of us just want to get through stuff that's new to us, and that sometimes involves things like Evasion-tanking Kaz'rogal... &gt;.&gt;</div>

</div>I was thinking same for last couple of weeks. Basicly cycles like 3s/5r work really well with only handful amount of interupts. There isn't many fights in MH/BT (at least those I encountered already, like 5/5 MH and 4/9 BT) that have alot of interupts, maybe beside randomness on Azgalor and Archmonde, and Akama's channelers short HP. However, on those fights sometimes I find 3/5 way to long to keep 100% of its power, I can imagine that with 5/5 or so, it's gettin even worse.<br>
<br>
I haven't tested 1/3 or other cycle combinations yet, but it would be nice to run some tests on shorter time periods and see what works better and whats not. I really hope for theorycraft EJ masterminds input on that <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304064942im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":)" class="inlineimg"></div>

		<div id="post_message_615964">I've read most of the comments on Shadowstep (including the -12% estimate). I'm no math wizard, so I tend to put quite some faith in the sheet (using 2.3.2.9 atm). The weird thing is that if I put my gear in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304064942/http://eu.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Lightbringer&amp;n=Pale" target="_blank">(Armory link)</a> which is mostly T4, Heartless and Searing Sunblade OH, the sheet shows my dps with combat swords is roughly equal (1% difference, depending on OH chosen) to Shadowstep/Assassination.<br>
<br>
So the point is: I'm really surprised by the minimal difference between combat and sub in the sheet. I know sub has been buffed a lot lately, but I hadn't expected it to be this viable. However, I've seen the comments in this thread (which come down to: ShS sucks, except for highly mobile fights) so I'm doubting the sheet now. Either the sheet is a bit too enthusiastic about ShS, or perhaps it's just a fluke having to do with my gearlevel?<br>
<br>
PS: you can diss ShS all you want, but seeing a fellow rogue ShS behind Al'ar in phase 1: priceless <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304064942im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/biggrin.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":D" class="inlineimg"></div>

I've noticed in a few places where people have mentioned that 3r and 5r receive the same AP benefit, and although I understand the AP formula behind rupture, I may be mixed up on the underlying mechanics.<br>
<br>
Currently, if I start getting into trouble with SnD up time or energy (currently run 1s/5r) due to bad luck with CP procs, I'll blow my rupture on the target at the point where I know I can't get to 5 points but still have time to get 1 point for SnD. Generally I have 4 points on target when this happens. Is there any advantage w/ regard to rupture to placing it on the target with 3 points instead of 4? Aside from the obvious point that I'd have a little more time for energy regen, that is.<br>
<br>
I guess I'm just not sure exactly how people are saying that a 3r receives the same bonus as a 5r, and how it applies to broken cycles.</div>

<br>
The only issue I am having is that there are a lot of times that I cut a good amount of snd time and get back to a 5r well before I can apply it.  This leaves me SSing until I can apply rupture and losing the CPs.  If I know I am going to be running far enough ahead of the 5r time, have the CPs/Energy, and won't risk dropping SnD... Should I do a 1-3 CP finisher before building my 5r. <br>
<br>
Something like...<br>
1s/5r - 1s/5r (realize running ahead) - 1s/2e/5r - back to 1s/5r or continue with a short CP finisher if cycle allows.<br>
<br>
If the 1/x/5 is worth doing what finisher should the x be?  I am a combat sword spec, and don't have improved evis.<br>

Or should I run with a shorter rupture like 1s/4r and just cut the SnD?</div>

		<div id="post_message_616521">A couple things...<br>
The spreadsheet has not double-dipped on Hemo DPS in a number of versions (fixed in 2.3.2.5).  If Hemo Debuff Estimate is enabled, the Hemo debuff in the buffs section does nothing anymore, so having both on is ok.  You can check this by selecting a Hemo build with Hemo Debuff Estimate on.  Add Hemo debuff under Buffs and you will see the DPS doesn't change anymore.<br>
<br>
The Hemo debuff amounts to a sizable amount of damage now that its up to 42 per tick or 420 per Hemo application which can be multiplied on Crits and other skill/talents/buffs which give damage multipliers while, of course, being mitigated by Armor reduction.  It's not too unreasonable to estimate that the raid could be gaining about 120 dps for the debuff alone over ones own personal damage.  Of course what that means for the WWS parse if the spreadsheet is showing a 30 DPS benefit is that one's personal damage is now somewhere about 90 DPS behind Combat Swords.<br>
<br>
So just as DPS Warriors sometimes wear Solarian's Sapphire to boost raid dps (at the sacrifice of personal DPS), some rogues will be Hemo to boost raid DPS.  I personally see little wrong with that.  I should add that at the point where you are only about 30 DPS with the debuff ahead of Combat Swords, a 2nd Hemo rogue will probably negate just about all of the advantage in occasional debuff overlap.  But if you are the only Hemo Rogue, I'd guess it's still a raid advantage.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Alright I have been reading the forums here for a while and have a situation now that the only thing I can find about it is to use a 1s/5r and cut the extra snd time.<br>
<br>
The only issue I am having is that there are a lot of times that I cut a good amount of snd time and get back to a 5r well before I can apply it.  This leaves me SSing until I can apply rupture and losing the CPs.  If I know I am going to be running far enough ahead of the 5r time, have the CPs/Energy, and won't risk dropping SnD... Should I do a 1-3 CP finisher before building my 5r. <br>
<br>
Something like...<br>
1s/5r - 1s/5r (realize running ahead) - 1s/2e/5r - back to 1s/5r or continue with a short CP finisher if cycle allows.<br>
<br>
If the 1/x/5 is worth doing what finisher should the x be?  I am a combat sword spec, and don't have improved evis.<br>
<br>
Or should I run with a shorter rupture like 1s/4r and just cut the SnD?</div>

</div>1s/5r is going to be pretty close to the edge of sustainability.  Your armory is showing 329 Hit Rating unbuffed, which means you are running at 349 buffed, which is very high, and will yield a proportionately high number of CP Procs.  In addition you are using 4/5 T4 which is going to give you an additional Combo Point some of the time.  The result of this is that while a normal rogue using 2/4 T4 is going to get 1 CP 60% of the time, you are going to 1 or 2 at times, and will have atleast 1 more often.  This also means you are going to have occational 2 point S&amp;D's without ever SS's after your finisher.  <br>
<br>
My recommendation without going into too much math, would be to first off migrate to some higher DPS items (T5 gloves and shoulders), and just plan on cutting and having slack time in your cycle.  The DPS you will get from any 2 point finisher is going to be inferior to just SS'ing more.  If you have 5 CP's, use Rupture, if Rupture is still up, wait until you have 70 energy to use it, then fire off S&amp;D again if you get 1-2 CP's, if not SS 1 time and fire off S&amp;D.  If you get in a situation where you can't ruture due to the last one being up with Mongoose/Trinket, then wait for it to fade, refresh it, and the S&amp;D or SS then S&amp;D.<br>
<br>
Bottomline, 1s/5r is about as good as you are going to get, if you have too much slack in that and are getting cycles shorter then rupture, and are in danger of energy capping, more Sinister Strikes will be better then anything less then a 4-5 point Eviserate (your SS is going to hit harder and won't disrupt your cycle).</div>

Yeah I will be breaking the T4 4piece soon.  Shortly I will be up for my T5 gloves and maybe some 'Shoulderpads of the Stranger' if they ever drop.  I didn't really want to run any funky cycles and then not have the extra CPs after upping gear and get all messed up.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">If I equip the S2 OH, and replace my 4agi/4hit gems with 8hit gems (4x) combat swords does 1.18% more dps than Assassination/Shadowstep..... Without replacing the gems it's 1.10%. Raidbuffed percentages btw, 1311dps vs 1297dps.<br>
<br>
Not sure why my crit is high, probably because I value agi&gt;hit. The reason for that is that with my high agi, i'm next to unhittable when popping evasion.

</div>I really don't think this is a gemming issue, since gems make up the equivilent of roughly an extra pice of gear and thus are not going to skew your results dramatically.<br>
<br>
My guess is that you simply have the option "include Hemo debuff in DPS estimate" turned on so you're actually seeing your raidwide total dps rather than just your personal dps.  My own 11/9/41 Shadowstep build (which is 1.9% more dps than 20/0/41 in my current gear) comes out 11% behind Combat Swords for personal dps.  When I check the "include Hemo debuff in DPS estimate" box it comes out 0.5% behind Combat Swords in blues/T4 and 0.8% in my current T4/T5 gear.<br>
<br>
Basically what that tells us is that by speccing any variant of Shadowstep we're bringing less dps to the raid as a whole than if we simply specced Combat Swords.  Not by a lot, not a lot at all in fact, but still less.</div>

</div>Which is still based on the assumption that every charge is used every time it is applied, which simply isn't the case (example: you shadowstep back in, Hemo, and then Hemo again 1 second later, before any of the other melee gets back in, or at the very least, before they can use all the charges).  The bottom line is that the very best case scenario is still worse then the worse case scenario for combat (since you normally get a disproportionately high value from cooldowns unless they come up again right as the boss dies).</div>

		<div id="post_message_616730">Ok, so point for discussion.  I decided this is probably the better forum to present this given that it has implications to mechanics as a whole.  I apologize in advance for the in-depth mathematics.<br>
<br>
This weekend I started to go through some mathematical theorycraft for some of the game mechanics starting with PPM.  My goal was to arrive at a formula that properly converted a proc per unit time into % uptime.<br>
<br>
So I began with the concept of a PPM proc that on average procs once every 50 seconds but could conceivably proc back-to-back (i.e. no cooldown) with a duration of 15 seconds.  Some may recognize this as 1.2 ppm on a single weapon auto-attacking with either Mongoose or Executioner if one believes the proc rate to be 1.2.<br>
So, to create a formula we have:<br>
Pf = Proc Frequency (for this example 50 seconds)<br>
Pd = Proc Duration<br>
Up = % Uptime<br>
<br>
So, looking at at if on average it seems a 15 second proc every 50 seconds gives 30% uptime, but this doesn't account for potential overlap.  So we really know 30% is a cap.<br>
Ov = % Overlap<br>
<br>
So, we have:<br>
Up = Pd/Pf*(1-Ov)<br>
<br>
<br>
Now, what should the % overlap be?  Clearly, % Overlap should equal % Uptime.<br>
So, we now have:<br>
Up = Pd/Pf*(1-Up)<br>
Solving for Up we get:<br>
Up = Pd/(Pf+Pd)<br>
<br>
So, for the example above we get 15/(50+15) = 23.1% uptime which is pretty close to the 25% estimates I've seen thrown out.<br>
<br>
So, let's check this calculation.  First, let's assume Proc frequency approaches 0.  In that case we get Pd/Pd = 1 or 100% uptime.  That works!<br>
Let's use another example.  Let's assume a proc frequency of 10 seconds for a proc with duration of 10 seconds.  It should be fairly obvious that because of proc overlaps you are going to have a 50% uptime.  Plugging it into the equation we get...  10/(10+10) = 0.5 or 50%<br>
<br>
So, I believe I have derived a simple formula for % uptime conversion...feel free to check the math, but it appears accurate.<br>
<br>
Now, step 2, the dreaded Deadly Poison proc calculation.  This becomes difficult because each proc adds another dose, still this formula could be used to derive % uptime (i.e % one has any combo points)<br>
Pf can be determined by 1/(Att/sec*ProcChance)...<br>
Aps = Attacks per second<br>
Pr = Proc Rate<br>
Using the formula, Up = 12/(1/(Aps*Pr)+12)<br>
So, the downtime = 1- that value.<br>
<br>
We now know the percent downtime or in other words the percent of time that we have no DP up.  Of course this doesn't take into account skills that use up one's Poison, but is the first step in the rest of the equation.<br>
<br>
I'll stop here for discussion, still working through and verifying my other calcs for uptime at various doses...<br>
<br>
Thoughts?  Comments?</div>

<br>
@hanos: I'll still gem the same. The difference from the +8hit gems is so minimal (and only while fully raidbuffed) that it's not worth the loss in survivability imo. And that's all that it is, my opinion <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304064942im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/biggrin.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":D" class="inlineimg"></div>

<br>
For Deadly Poison, I would recommend looking at post 883; it is, to my knowledge, the best known model of Deadly Poison uptime (and the one used in v0.9.3 and higher of the Rogue Gear sheet)<br>
<br>
For Mongoose:<br>
<br>
Well, first, let me derive the canonical formula for Mongoose Uptime.<br>
If the proc occurs once every Pf seconds on average, that means that the chance it procs during any particular second is 1/Pf, which I will denote for the moment as p.  Let q = 1-p.<br>
<br>
Now, lets consider the actual uptime granted by a mongoose proc that starts at T=0.  We will condition on the time of the next proc.  For simplicity I'm going to use the actual duration of 15 seconds, but the same technique is easily extended to general times.<br>
<br>
If the following proc occurs at T=15 or later, the initial proc gives a full 15 seconds of uptime.  However, if the following proc occurs at time T=t for t&lt;15, the initial proc only gives t seconds of uptime; uptime after that point is counted towards the following proc.<br>
<br>
Now, the probability that the next proc occurs at time T=t is the probability that it procs at that time (which we've defined to be p) times the probability that none of the t-1 preceding seconds contains a proc, which is easily shown to be q^{t-1}.  Hence, the expected uptime gained by our proc of Mongoose is then:<br>
<br>
p + 2pq + 3pq^2 + ... + 14pq^13+15pq^14(1 + q + q^2 + ...)<br>
Now, 1 + q + q^2 + q^3 + ... is a well-known infinite sum; it's value is easily shown to be 1/(1-q).  But 1-q = p, so our formula simplifies to <br>
<br>
p + 2pq + 3pq^2 + ... + 14pq^13+15q^14<br>
<br>
Let us then write 15q^14 = 14q^14 + q^14; this then combines with the preceding term as follows:<br>
14pq^13 + 14q^14 + q^14<br>
=14q^13(p+q)+q^14<br>
=14q^13 + q^14<br>
<br>
as p+q = 1.  But then applying the same trick repeatedly, we find that the entire sum telescopes down to<br>
1+q+q^2+...+q^14<br>
<br>
which is easily shown to be<br>
<br>
(1-q^15)/(1-q) = (1-q^15)/p<br>
<br>
Now, since procs by defenition occur once every 1/p seconds on average, the average *uptime* is then (1-q^15)/p seconds out of every 1/p; hence, average uptime is simply 1-q^15.<br>
<br>
Substituting back in your variables, this becomes 1-(1-1/Pf)^Pd.  This would be the estimate that is used in the Rogue Gear sheet.<br>
<br>
Now, lets see how this compares to your formula;<br>
<br>
Again, let 1/Pf = p, and Pd = n (for notational simplicity).  hence we wish to evaluate<br>
<br>
1-(1-p)^n<br>
<br>
Expanding by the binomial theorem, we have (1-p)^n = 1 - np + n(n-1)/2 * p^2 + .... <br>
If p is small, we can cross off the higher order terms, as they will be small in comparison to the first few.  hence, lets approximate this as <br>
1-(1 - np + n(n-1)/2* p^2) = np(1 - (n-1)p/2)<br>
Substituting in your variables, we have Pd/Pf * (1 - (Pd-1)/2Pf)<br>
<br>
Now, if (Pd-1)/2Pf is small, this is roughly equal to<br>
<br>
Pd/Pf * (1/(1 + (Pd-1)/2Pf)) = Pd/(Pf + (Pd-1)/2)<br>
<br>
Assuming Pd &gt;&gt; 1 (i.e.., Pd = 15), this becomes<br>
<br>
Pd/(Pf+.5Pd)<br>
<br>
Which is... certainly similar to what you came up with, but is definitely a bit different.<br>
<br>
So, how accurate are these various models?  Well, for Pd = 15 and Pf = 50, your model gives 23.08%; my approximate model gives 26.09%; and the full exact model I derived gives 26.14%.<br>
<br>
So, if one is interested in maximum accuracy, I would go with the formula 1-(1-1/Pf)^Pd.  However, if you want a simpler formula, I would use Pd/(Pf+.5Pd) rather than Pd/(Pf+Pd), as it is equally simple and much more accurate.<br>
<br>
<b>Edit for additional details</b><br>
The problem with the approximation you performed is that while the probability that a proc occurs during an existing uptime period can reasonably be approximated by (1-Up); however, a proc occurring during an existing proc does not totally waste the uptime of that proc; on average, in only wastes half of it.  Hence, the way you've defined Up and Ov, you actually have Ov = Up/2.  Hence, the formula to be solving is Up = Pd/Pf * (1-Up/2), which simplifies to the Up = Pd/(Pf + .5Pd) I derive above.  The difference between the approximation and the full solution is that the actual uptime lost isn't exactly half on average; given that overlap occurs, the time at which the 2nd proc occurs is not uniformly distributed over the input times, but, instead, a probability distribution determined by the exact values of Pf and Pd.</div>

		<div id="post_message_616871">Actually, you miss the point of (1-Up).  1-Up is the average % portion of each proc which is lost.  Or, on average, one loses of ones duration a percentage of it relative to uptime and only gains relative to downtime.  Pd/(Pf+0.5Pd) is clearly wrong because as one's proc frequency approaches 0 you'd have a 200% uptime.<br>
<br>
Also, the problem with your model of a Mongoose proc beginning at T=0 is the possibility that it over laps with a proc starting at T=-15 to T=0.  As this is a continually modeled system, one must address that possibility as well.</div>

		<div id="post_message_616898">Yes, the model breaks down in the degenerate case as t = 0 (and, in particular, whenever Pd &gt; 2Pf).  However, the number of procs that this is true for is vanishingly small; for all real procs, where Pf &gt; 2Pd, Pd/(Pf+.5Pd) is a superior estimate.<br>
<br>
Regarding your critique of my model: that's actually factored in.  Note that we're defining the length of a proc as "the time from this proc until the next proc, up to a maximum of 15 seconds".  Hence, the removal of the overlap between the current proc and the preceding one is taken into account by the truncation of the preceding proc rather than needing to remove anything from the one we're analyzing.<br>
<br>
So, for instance, lets say there are procs at T=-5, T = 0, T=10, and T=30.  This means that Mongoose would actually be up from T=-5 to T=-25 and from T=30 to T=45.  So, P_{-5}, the proc that occurs at T=-5, "owns" the uptime from T=-5 to T=0; the remainder of it's uptime is lost, because it has been overwritten at T=0 and hence that proc is over.  P_0, the proc at T=0, similarly owns the 10 seconds of uptime from T=0 to T=10, before getting overwritten by P_10.  P_10 then owns the uptime from T=10 to T=25, and P_25 owns the uptime from T=25 to T=40 (unless it gets overwritten by another proc itself, of course, but you get the idea).  Hence, because were are defining the uptime of a proc to be "until it gets overwritten", the proc at T=0 by definition does not overlap any prior proc - because that proc is declared to end at T=0 when the proc we are investigating starts.<br>
<br>
Note that this model, of course, has issues as well for Pf&lt;1, because then p &gt; 1 and clearly no proc can occur with probability more than one in any given second.  So, if you want to be technical, it should really be 1-(1-min(1, 1/Pf))^Pd to fix that.<br>
<br>
And of course, to be *totally* technical, one should not quantize to seconds, and instead define:<br>
<br>
v = average numbers of hits per second<br>
p = probability that a hit procs the effect<br>
d = duration of the effect<br>
<br>
and then set<br>
<br>
Uptime = 1-(1-p)^vd (as opposed to the formula above, which is, effectively, 1-(1-pv)^d) which resolves this issue more elegantly; however, it can be easily shown for d of reasonable size (say, &gt;= 10) these are very close to equivalent; for instance, in the case of mongoose with a 1.5 speed weapon, we have v = .667, d=.03, and v = 15; with the newest formula, this gives uptime of 26.26%, meaning that the value of this proc would be misestimated by less than one percent using either estimate in my previous post.</div>

		<div id="post_message_616998">I think all we can do is agree to disagree.  I don't see Pd/(Pf+0.5Pd) being a superior model as I'm pretty sure that the entire equation can be solved in a simple manner and the result is Pd/(Pf+Pd) which seems to work for all cases of duration and frequency.  This formula does not breakdown as frequency goes to 0 and seems to be accurate in cases where frequency equals duration.  Your equation seemingly has a flaw at some point, hence the issue with frequencies approaching 0.<br>
<br>
I'm not sure where your formula is deviating.  It might have something to do with the proc duration extending past your average proc time or the reduction of terms or the possibility of unlucky streaks of proc downtime which essentially extends the proc window and thus reduces the percent uptime.  What I haven't seen is a refutation of the formula I derived other than the observation that it does not seem to agree with yours.<br>
<br>
I believe I have approached the proc issue in a simple and direct manner and am looking for flaws in the logic of the derivation.  I'm not trying to be critical nor argumentative.  Just looking to see if there are any apparent oversights in the logic.</div>

		<div id="post_message_617032">Well, okay, lets go over your derivation again.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to attack you here; it's just that your conclusion a) contradicts significant amounts of existing theorycraft, and b) goes against my intuition.  I admit it's a bit harder to demonstrate where your model differs from reality, but, for instance:  Lets say Pd = 5, and Pf = 1.  That is, on average, it procs once per second, and the buff lasts for 5 seconds.  Does it seem reasonable to you that such a buff is only up 83% of the time?  I confess that it seems to me that it should be up significantly more than that.  And, for instance, we note that your model clearly must be missing *something*, since in this example if the attacks are occuring, say, once per second, it is *impossible* for the buff to drop, as the only way to average one proc a second when you attack once a second is to proc on every single attack - so the probably the the buff manages to drop is, well zero.  Now, if you're attacking twice a second, then it *can* drop, as it only needs to proc on 50% of attacks so it can drop.  However, in order for a 5 second buff to go down it would need to fail to proc 10 attacks in a row - a 1 in a 1000 shot, which I don't see causing 17% downtime.<br>
<br>
So, fundamentally: for Pf small but nonzero, your model seems to underestimate uptime; plus, the fact that it has no consideration of rate of attacks (which clearly does matter) indicates that it's somewhat lacking as well.<br>
<br>
So, with that as a plausibility argument that there seems to be a flaw in the model - lets see if we can figure out what it might be.  (Yes, the Pd/(Pf+.5Pd) model clearly has flaws as well; but it's clearly stated as an approximation for the case where Pf &gt; Pd so it doesn't surprise me at all that it's wrong for Pf near 0.  You'll note that the full model doesn't have this problem).<br>
<br>
Now, the point of contention seems to be overlap, which I think we all have a fair idea what overlap is *supposed* to mean, but lets look for a minute at how it actually is modeling. It seems to be defined by the following equation from your post:<br>
<br>
Up = Pd/Pf*(1-Ov)<br>
<br>
So, overlap is the proportion of uptime that is lost to overlapping procs.  Okay, sure.<br>
<br>
Now, I think the place you get into trouble is with the assumption<br>
<br>
<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px; ">
	<div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom:0px"><img src="/web/20080304235246im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/chestnut/misc/citation.gif" border="0"></div>
	<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" border="0" width="100%">
	<tr>
		<td class="alt2" style="border:1px inset">
			
				Now, what should the % overlap be?  Clearly, % Overlap should equal % Uptime.
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</div>Now, there's no real argument that %overlap is *related* to %uptime... but saying that they have to be equal doesn't strike me as clear at all.  So lets examine this assumption in a little more detail.<br>
<br>
Uptime is the precentage of the time that the buff is up; hence, if we have an event that happens at any point of time with equal probability, it clearly occurs during the time the buff is uptime percent of the time.  So, if we were computing, for instance, what portion of sword spec procs occur during mongoose, the answer would just be uptime% of them.  And, similarly, the number of mongoose *procs* that occur during exiting uptime period is clearly uptime% of them - but how much actual uptime loss is there (as that's what overlap measures)?  Well, since the proc is equally likely to occur at any point during an existing uptime period, on average, only half of the uptime of that proc is wasted.  Hence, uptime% of procs lose half their uptime; hence, overlap should only be uptime/2.<br>
<br>
Fundamentally, the point here is that as a buff with *duration*, the intuition that uptime = overlap doesn't hold; if we were talking about, say, two different instant procs (SS and WF, say) occuring with probabilities p and q, the probably that both happen on one attack (that they "overlap") is the pq you'd expect.  And the number of *procs* that occur during uptime also is what you expect.  But the amount of proc uptime lost - which is what we defined overlap to be - has no reason to be the same, and, in fact, should be about half the uptime of the buff, not the full uptime.  So I would argue that the equation we're leading to is uptime = Pd/Pf*(1-Uptime/2), which gives the Uptime = Pd/(Pf+0.5/Pd) result that I asserted previously.<br>
<br>
Now, as you have pointed out, this approximation clearly has some problems; it doesn't behave correctly in the limit, and I freely admit it's an approximation.  So where did we go wrong?<br>
<br>
Well, overlap is the loss of uptime to overlapping procs, and we made the assumption that we lose half the uptime of a proc that occurs during an existing uptime period.  Well, this isn't actually quite true.  It's true that a proc can occur at any point in time during an existing proc with equal probability... but it's *not* true that it's necessarily the *first* proc.  And if there has already been a proc during the current uptime period, the current uptime period is no longer 15 seconds long, so the amount of uptime lost is, on average, longer.<br>
<br>
Hence, what we're looking for is the average time of the *first* proc during an uptime period, which is *not* uniformly distributed in the proc uptime; the probability it occurs at a given time is the probability that it occurs at that time... times the probability that it hasn't happened previously.  Hence, the *first* proc is more likely to occur in the beginning portion of the uptime of an existing buff than it is towards the end - the probability isn't uniform, so the loss of uptime is not necessarily half, on average.  Hence, one must inspect *this* probability distribution, which gets into things like attack frequency and the like, and the more sophisticated derivation I proposed earlier.<br>

</div>There may be a minimum, but it's certainly not 1; I know for a fact I've had my OH hitting around .7 (as confirmed by viewing combat logs, not trusting the character screen) and I've had the character sheet report it as low as .17.  So if the character screen is wrong, I can't swear there's no minimum, but I can confirm it's not 1 second.  And if the character screen is right... if there's a minimum, it's totally irrelevant is it's only achievable with 2 Unholy Frenzies from Hyjal + Bloodlust/Herosim + SnD + Blade Flurry + Haste Pots + Drums + Dragonspine proc... or something similar.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Thanks Hanos and Hannigaholic. I can't check it now, but this must be the case.<br>
<br>
@hanos: I'll still gem the same. The difference from the +8hit gems is so minimal (and only while fully raidbuffed) that it's not worth the loss in survivability imo. And that's all that it is, my opinion <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304235246im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/biggrin.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":D" class="inlineimg"></div>

</div>That would be your opinion, and most of us would disagree with it for several reasons.  First off you can't proc combat potency on a miss, considering there is no cooldown on Combat Potency, the more you hit the more procs you get, second, things like Mongoose, Executioner, Dragonspine, and Madness all Proc on hit, they can't proc if you miss, more hits leads to more procs (even if you aren't combat spec'ed).<br>
<br>
Now looking at your gear, you could easily add 40 hit rating to your gear, and swap to 0/20/41 instead of 20/0/41 and significantly increase you damage.  However, I find the people who try to justify spec'ing shadowstep for raiding and try to justify agility over dodge due to increased survivability tend to be a lost cause, because they don't understand that there are about 3-4 fights in the game where you need to dodge, and the additional 1% or so dodge you are getting from that additional 40 Agility instead of 40 Hit, isn't going to save you when you screw up and pull aggro.  <br>
<br>
This is the same argument that people were using to try use to justify spec'ing shadowstep for raiding (which coincidently you have done), because while it did less damage you could survive screwing up.  As a rogue your job, and your only job, is to do as much DPS as possible based on your gear and the fight, anything that prevents that is a failure in your role as a rogue, there is nothing random that will kill you that could not be prevented by playing better, so there is no real justification for ever spec'ing anything other then Combat as a raiding rogue as long as you are trying to progress.<br>
<br>
<br>
The real difference between hit and Agi is that hit is going to give you more DPS and it is going to be more consistent, with more consistent cycles thanks to more CP Procs and more hit based procs.  Dodge is nice when it works, but it isn't something you ever want to rely on, if you pull aggro, you have already screwed up, if you plan on not screwing up, then you don't need to spec to survive the screw up.</div>

</div>There is no maximum haste rating that you every have to worry about hitting, while there might be a theoretical cap at 100%, that would be 1580 haste rating, which really isn't obtainable.  <br>
<br>
As far as weapon speed below 1 that is one of those stupid myths that I am pretty sure is covered multiple places on this forum.  Think about it, Blizzard put 1.3 and 1.4 speed weapons in game, Slice and Dice causes you to hit 30% faster, Heroism causes you to hit 30% faster, 2 Piece T6 causes you to hit 5% faster, Dragonspine, Abacus, BS Maces, and Haste Pots all cause you to hit faster.<br>
<br>
While I could provide combat logs to show this, I am at work currently, and don't have access to my logs, but you can test it by taking you 1.4 speed offhand, and attacking mob, hitting S&amp;D, then popping a haste pot or getting a shaman to pop heroism or popping Abacus.  Look at the combat log, you will see off hand hits less then 1 second apart.<br>

That being said, in a lot of cases, especially at the T6 level, Lionseyes will be easy to get, Pyrestones perhaps somewhat less easy, and Spinels should be damn near impossible (if your raid leader is even remotely sensible in this regard), so sometimes scarcity of gems can play an issue in this as well.</div>

So excuse me if this question has been asked but how does expertise affect you in raids?<br>
<br>
I have gotten the Shoulderpads of the Stranger when I started raiding with my new guild.  Now looking at things like shadowpanter.net they have it actually rated higher then that of the Deathmantle Shoulderpads.  <br>
<br>
Well I had just gotten my Tier 5 shoulders and feels like I had just wasted DKP on a item that I didn’t really need  <br>
<br>
How is it that Shoulderpads of the Stranger &gt; then Deathmantle Shoulderpads?<br>
<br>
FYI my rogue with Shoulderpads has 311hit, 174X AP, 25ish Crit and 12 expertises.  If I use the Deathmantale Shoulderpads I have 32Xhit, 173XAP, 24ish crit and 10 expertise rating.<br>
<br>
I mean shouldn’t your attacks not be dodged/parried if you’re behind your target in raids?  Since the tank should have agro and faced away from the raid at all times  <br>

</div>You can't be blocked or parried from behind the mob.  But dodges still happen.   So that expertise, in the end, works like giving you more hit.   3.94 Expertise Rating = 1 Expertise = 0.25% less dodge/parry.    So assuming there's no other expertise rating pieces on you, you get an effective 2 expertise out of those shoulders (2.54 to be exact but it's floored down).    So that's another 0.5% less dodge.   Equivalent to 0.5% more hit (~7.9 hit ratings worth of it).<br>
<br>
Piece for piece I think Stranger is better.  But if you get 4pc T5 you can swap in those for the bonus.</div>

Mobs (not players) can dodge from behind, so expertise has value approximately equal to +hit (that is, 1% less dodge is roughly equal to 1% more hit).  The ratings value differently, but the spreadsheets calculate that out for you. :P  (or saedo can!)<br>

Also, just as a note, I have an itemrack/closetgnome setup for when I am soloing with my rogue, which includes a few different pieces - in a gear setup like that, Expertise is twice as valuable, since it now reduces parries as well.</div>

</div>Glinting Pyrestone/Noble Topaz is an excellent gem, and I have personally used them extensively and still have more in my gear then the spreadsheets recommend, and they are a nice balance between fully buffed and unbuffed as well as keeping you from wasting itemization points when not fighting a boss.  I was giving him a hard time for arguing for pure Agi gems and favoring them for the added dodge.  If you use all Agi gems, you will gain 1-2% more dodge, which means instead of getting splatted on the first swing, you get spatted on the second (1 time in 50 when you pull aggro on a boss... and if a guild keeps you around long enough to pull aggro on a boss 50 times, min-maxing isn't your biggest concern)..  There are even some specs and gear levels where Agi is better.  The idea wasn't completely wrong, just the reasoning.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Glinting Pyrestone/Noble Topaz is an excellent gem, and I have personally used them extensively and still have more in my gear then the spreadsheets recommend, and they are a nice balance between fully buffed and unbuffed as well as keeping you from wasting itemization points when not fighting a boss.  I was giving him a hard time for arguing for pure Agi gems and favoring them for the added dodge.  If you use all Agi gems, you will gain 1-2% more dodge, which means instead of getting splatted on the first swing, you get spatted on the second (1 time in 50 when you pull aggro on a boss... and if a guild keeps you around long enough to pull aggro on a boss 50 times, min-maxing isn't your biggest concern)..  There are even some specs and gear levels where Agi is better.  The idea wasn't completely wrong, just the reasoning.<br>

		<div id="post_message_617857">To make a long story short.  I found the basic issue with that formula.  That formula is true for the case of all real numbers where procs can occur at any time but the integral nature of the problem causes increasing inaccuracy where time between attacks approaches the proc duration.<br>
<br>
Now, that said, I see one issue with the current implementation of your formula which is skewing it high.  You are using hit frequency where one needs attack frequency (or in other words integral time between attacks - probably estimated as an average to simplify the equation which is true for basic offhand attacks by not so true for main hand).  The difference between hit frequency and attack frequency needs to be factored into the proc rate as opposed to extending the attack frequency which you currently are doing.  The equation you have proposed is only accurate when the hit rate equals the attack rate or in other words, one never misses.  <br>
<br>
So, using your example above but change d=4 (for simpler math) p=1 with 1 hit per sec and 1 sec per hit making v=1 .<br>
Uptime = 1-(1-p)^vd correctly gives 1-(1-1)^4*1=1<br>
<br>
But the problem is with the average hit rate.  Let's say somehow one misses/is dodged 50% of the time.  Now, you get the same formula when you have 2 attacks per second missing 50% of the time.  Your average hit is still 1 per second which using the above formula still gives d=4 p=1 v=1 <br>
Uptime = 1-(1-p)^vd correctly gives 1-(1-1)^4*1=1<br>
<br>
But if you propagate the hit rate to the proc rate you instead have the much more accurate d=4 p=1*0.5=0.5 v=2<br>
Uptime = 1-(1-0.5)^4*2=1-(0.5)^8=1-0.015625=0.984365 for a 98.4% uptime demonstrating that there is a chance to miss.<br>
<br>
I think I've found my issue with your formula.  If one uses raw # of attacks with attacks per time propagating the miss rate into the proc rate, then I agree with your formulation.  (I just derived the same thing a different way.)<br>
<br>
There still is the issue regarding attack frequency not truly hitting the marks (instant attacks, sword spec procs skew this) , but it should be close enough and should certainly be accurate for offhand attacks (neglecting Shiv, etc)</div>

		<div id="post_message_618148">I'd say the top 6 builds these days are probably something like:<br>
<br>
Combat Swords (16/41 + 4)<br>
Combat Hybrid (16/45 Fist/Sword or Mace/Sword)<br>
TSH-Swords (11/28/22 or thereabouts)<br>
TSH-Other (11/21/29)<br>
Combat Daggers (15/41/5)<br>
Mutilate (41/20/0)<br>
<br>
There are certainly some other builds that get used (11/9/41, 43/0/18, 30/28/3, etc.) but they're defenitely rarer and pretty clearly inferior, so I'd leave them out for now.<br>
<br>
In terms of pruning that list of 6 further: I'd expect Combat Swords and Combat Hybrid to be pretty similar, so you likely  don't need both; I'd probably include both TSH options as they will likely have fairly different stat weightings; and Combat Daggers should probably stay as well, as, for better or worse, there's a lot of dagger rogues out there.  As for Mutilate... while it is a decent build and it is fairly common, I don't have a lot of confidence that we know the stat weightings for it with the same accuracy, so I'm somewhat inclined to leave it off for now.</div>

</div>Right... upon contemplation, that's probably the better way of formulating it.  So instead of the above definitions, we define<br>
<br>
v = average numbers of <b>attacks</b> per second<br>
p = probability that an <b>attack</b> procs the effect<br>
d = duration of the effect<br>
<br>
Note that the probability of an attack proccing equals the probability that an attack hits time the probability that the hit procs the effect, which is what you were saying, and at this point the formula<br>
<br>
Up = 1-(1-p)^vd<br>
<br>
should be correct.<br>
<br>
However, in the name of scientific curiosity: I decided to test this.  I wrote a simple program to simulate indefenite autoattacking with a single weapon, no procs that effect attack rate, etc., with the above parameters tunable.<br>
<br>
<b>Data set 1:</b><br>
v = 1.0<br>
p = .02 (1 proc per 50 seconds, all attacks hitting)<br>
d = 15<br>
<br>
Predicted: 1-(1-.02)^15 = .2614<br>
Trial 1: .2609<br>
Trial 2: .2618<br>
Trial 3: .2620<br>
<br>
<b>Data set 2:</b><br>
v = 1.0<br>
p = .018 (1 proc per 50 seconds, 90% hit rate)<br>
d = 15<br>
<br>
Note that this is a reasonable model of OH Mongoose for most rogues.<br>
<br>
Predicted: 1-(1-.018)^15 = .2385<br>
Trial 1: .2386<br>
Trial 2: .2384<br>
Trial 3: .2396<br>
<br>
<b>Data set 3:</b><br>
v = 2.0<br>
p = .009 (1 proc per 50 seconds, 90% hit rate)<br>
d = 15<br>
<br>
Predicted: 1-(1-.009)^30 = .2376<br>
Trial 1: .2385<br>
Trial 2: .2379<br>
Trial 3: .2362<br>
<br>
And, just to try something well outside the normal range, lets see what happens if we're attacking 10 times a second with a buff that procs 10% of the time and lasts for 5 seconds:<br>
<br>
<b>Data set 4:</b><br>
v = 10.0<br>
p = .1<br>
d = 5<br>
<br>
Predicted: 1-(1-.1)^50 = .9948<br>
Trial 1: .9949<br>
Trial 2: .9946<br>
Trial 3: .9947<br>
<br>
So, off the top of my head: this formula seems to match pretty well with theory under the assumption that attacks are more or less evenly spaced.  Next step: check how well it works in a MH situation, where the attacks do not come at a uniform rate but can cluster and burst and whatever due to Sword Spec, Windfury, yellow attacks, etc.  I suspect it'll run pretty close, though there will likely be at least some deviation.</div>

		<div id="post_message_618281">The maths on Mongoose uptime probably belong in Roguecraft 201, not 101 :P<br>
<br>
If you're planning on adding in MH, and determing the uptime when you have both weapons, you really don't need to do much more work as long as you continue to think in the same way.  While the probability distributions for Sword Spec and Windfury are going to be heavily related to when the auto-attacks with each weapon, you can't make any determination where the Instants are going to fall in there.  All you know is that they're going to come at most once a second and be on average every ~4 seconds for SS (the dps spreadsheet does calculate this exact value).  That average value is all we need to work with though.<br>
<br>
We get the probability that mongoose is up at any time as 1 - P(MH auto attack did not proc in last 15 seconds) * P(offhand did not) * P(Windfury did not) * P(Sword Spec did not) * P(instants did not).  Each of these can be calculated just as Aldriana mentioned, without needing to worry about exactly how the attacks fell the last 15 seconds.  Just knowing how many on average have occurred is exactly what we care about, as long as the chance of each hitting is constant.<br>
<br>
We're still led to the circular problem of the cycle determining the attacks per time period and thus the proc uptime, but the proc uptime (since it gives haste) might have an effect the best cycle.  That's one problem that I have absolutely no idea how to solve other than just saying it's close enough and you should always be modifying your cycles due to your luck in the recent past.<br>
<br>
edit: I went back to the post on DP and somehow I completely missed Left's post the first time - presumably because I was typing up my own ramblings on Markov chains.  While it was basically a perfect analysis if all that mattered is average stack uptime (it isn't, but it's probably close enough), I'm still going to maintain that you're overestimating the uptime of DP because from my experience it always drops off after the 4th tick without being refreshed - even if that was only 9.1 seconds ago.  10.5 is a much better estimate than 12 of time required since last refrech for the stack to drop, given that the refresh time is uniformly distributed with respect to time since last tick, which is always 3n seconds after the first application, for some n.<br>
<br>
It's possible that I'm wrong with respect to how this works and I was just hallucinating or dreaming about when I saw a stack dissapear right as it ticked that clearly had more than a second left and a 1-stack appear immediately afterwards.  I don't say that completely facetiously either - I've had plenty of dreams where strange things happen in WoW.</div>

</div>While I agree with you there, some of the mathematics is beyond what most of the people I play WoW with would understand.  While it's fairly simple probability theory to me, "simple" is a relative word when you're a graduate mathematics student taking classes in 2 different areas of statistics and probability this term.

</div>Oh, I'm sure we could get some upper-division Roguecraft threads going; the issue with such is that this sort of analysis isn't being done continuously.  We go a few weeks without doing much at all, and then an interesting/hard problems come along so we have to break out the big guns.  Hence, this sort of analysis tends to crop up every so often in all the various rogue threads, depending on where the question arose.  But, if people feel a need for a thread devoted specifically to heavy-duty modeling of rogue mechanics, I'm up to the challenge <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080401231608im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":)" class="inlineimg">.<br>

				If you're planning on adding in MH, and determing the uptime when you have both weapons, you really don't need to do much more work as long as you continue to think in the same way.  While the probability distributions for Sword Spec and Windfury are going to be heavily related to when the auto-attacks with each weapon, you can't make any determination where the Instants are going to fall in there.  All you know is that they're going to come at most once a second and be on average every ~4 seconds for SS (the dps spreadsheet does calculate this exact value).  That average value is all we need to work with though.<br>
<br>
We get the probability that mongoose is up at any time as 1 - P(MH auto attack did not proc in last 15 seconds) * P(offhand did not) * P(Windfury did not) * P(Sword Spec did not) * P(instants did not).  Each of these can be calculated just as Aldriana mentioned, without needing to worry about exactly how the attacks fell the last 15 seconds.  Just knowing how many on average have occurred is exactly what we care about, as long as the chance of each hitting is constant.<br>
<br>
We're still led to the circular problem of the cycle determining the attacks per time period and thus the proc uptime, but the proc uptime (since it gives haste) can effect the best cycle.  That's one problem that I have absolutely no idea how to solve other than just saying it's close enough and you should always be modifying your cycles due to your luck in the recent past.

	</tr>
	</table>
</div>Well, right; I mean, the attacks will on average be more or less randomly distributed across time - but 'randomly distributed" is sort of a different ballgame then "periodically every t seconds".  Now, I fully expect the answers to be highly similar, and, frankly, I've been using this exact model in the gear sheet for a year (as in, dating back to before I made the sheet publicly available, back when I was just using it for my own purposes) without a second thought for it's accuracy.  If the MH case is different by more than a percent or two, I'll be surprised.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, I've been surprised before, so it probably *is* worth doing a quick simulation as a sanity check; alas, that simulation is significantly harder to write.<br>
<br>
Regarding the cycles effecting uptime effecting cycles issue: yes, this circular reference is the essential problem of rogue modeling.  It's, in fact, the reason I gave up on the Rogue DPS sheet and released the Rogue Gear sheet, since, at the time, it was not being handled well at all in the DPS sheet.  The Gear sheet resolves this by iterating cycle computation a couple of times until the answer converges on a particular cycle, and uses that.  This process, in fact, comprises a good solid third of the computations in the Gear sheet.  A direct analytic answer would of course be better, but iterating to convergeance works pretty well and is a heck of a lot easier.  I'm not sure how the DPS sheet handles it these days.<br>
<br>
Note, however, that haste in particular tends not to be a major issue for cycle determination, given that it proportionally reduces the proc rate on PPM effects so procs per unit time are largely unchanged; the only feedback mechanism that allows haste effects to change the cycle is Combat Potency.  So it's perhaps not as much of an issue as one might expect, but it does still require some careful handling.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_618381"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I agree that the MH hits should do little to skew the data.  One can say that MH specials are "randomly" distributed but they are far less random than purely random given one usually has to wait for the energy to use them.  The gaps between them may change in size, but they are still likely at least fairly evenly distributed throughout the timeline.<br>
<br>
I'm a little more worried about the effect of Sword Spec procs / proccing Windfury / proccing Sword Spec again, but I'm not sure there is a really good way to avoid this or easily calculate this.  I still don't believe this will throw the computations off all that much although maybe worth testing these spikes.  OHs should work very well given a 100% SnD time only differing for iteration when Haste procs or on use Haste items kick in.<br>
<br>
In terms of procs affecting cycles, my planned way to implement this on the DPS spreadsheet is to estimate the uptimes so the cycles have something to go by.  Then come to an exact computation which will add or subtract dps based on the difference from the estimates.  Following that, I plan to add a Macro that essentially will switch the computed uptimes in as the estimates (essentially iterating by Macro).  There are too many items that are just calculated after the fact or which have estimated uptimes that could be made more accurate.  The short answer ito how its currently modeled in the DPS sheet is that the estimated uptimes are probably working pretty decently in terms of cycle effects, but are not as accurate in terms of item value.  Whereas the items that are formulated after the fact are probably pretty reasonably estimated in terms of item value but are not feedbacking into the cycles.  As you might notice, I'm putting a sharper eye on accuracy of the proc mechanics.  Once I implement more accurate formulas, item-by-item I can follow through on the above-mention plan of action.<br>
<br>
Now, talking Deadly Poison.  One can essentially determine the uptime by the previously mentioned formulas which also equates downtime.  Which tells you that x % of the time you have 0 stacks up and 1-x % of the time you have 1-5 stacks up.  If we subtract off the 0 stack subset and only look at the 1-5 stacks, wouldn't the % downtime equate to the same % downtime at 0 stacks?<br>
<br>
I think it does, as the % time stuck at 0 stacks vs the rest of stacks seems like it should equate to the same percent of time stuck at 1 stack vs 2 or more as the chance to elevate to a higher stack should be the same as elevating from 0 stacks.  If one continues that up the line you get...<br>
<br>
0 stacks = %downtime determination -&gt; D0 which is also the probability at 0 stacks<br>
So wouldn't it follow that probability at the other stacks would be...<br>
1 stacks = (1-D0)*(D0) -&gt; D1<br>
2 stacks = (1-D0-D1)*(D0) -&gt; D2<br>
3 stacks = (1-D0-D1-D2)*(D0) -&gt; D3<br>
4 stacks = (1-D0-D1-D2-D3)*(D0) -&gt; D4<br>
5 or more stacks =  (1-D0-D1-D2-D3-D4)<br>
<br>
Is there some flaw with this logic?  If not, this seems maybe a more accurate way of determining uptime at different levels.  Granted, it doesn't account for the damage being determined every 3 seconds from the start, but it may make sense that the percent time spent at a given stack size might be equivalent to the number of damage procs at a given stack level.

		<div id="post_message_618459"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->So, I agree that the distribution of attacks isn't totally random - however, it's certainly very complicated, and "random" is probably a better approximation than "periodic" given that you have:<br>
<br>
1) Autoattacks, which are periodic;<br>
2) Yellow attacks - both your CPGs (Combo Point Generators) and finishers, which are... roughly periodic, but not precisely due to energy queueing, frequency of Combat Potency procs, etc.<br>
3) Two forms of procs, which occur on a random selection of those attacks, and occur up to 1 second after the initial attack, some of which are generated by OH attacks which are on yet a third periodicity.<br>
<br>
Now, even neglecting the fact that 2 isn't totally periodic, we have two periodic effects (with different periods), with two interwoven more-or-less random ones (they're not randomly distributed across all time, but I suspect if I gave you a list of times at which SS procced for me in a given fight and a list of random numbers, you'd be hard pressed to tell which is which.<br>
<br>
So, it's not totally random - there *is* quite a bit of structure - but it's complicated enough structure that it's probably just better to think of them as random.  However, I still don't think the answer will be very different from the periodic case - within a couple percent, to be sure.<br>
<br>
Regarding the Deadly Poison estimate: I think the difference between the frequency of having no poison up and the frequency of having some other number of stacks up is not the same, as the transition table is different, as it's not possible for the number of stacks to drop from, say, 2 to 1 or 5 to 3.  If poison stacks dropped off one at a time, something like that would be possible; since they all drop at once, I don't think it quite works (although I'm having a hard time explaining why).<br>
<br>
That said: I did just have an idea how to improve this model to more accurately reflect the real-world case, but it's getting rather late so I don't have the brainpower to push it through to a solution.  I'll try to do that tomorrow when I'm more awake.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Glinting Pyrestone/Noble Topaz is an excellent gem, and I have personally used them extensively and still have more in my gear then the spreadsheets recommend, and they are a nice balance between fully buffed and unbuffed as well as keeping you from wasting itemization points when not fighting a boss.  I was giving him a hard time for arguing for pure Agi gems and favoring them for the added dodge.  If you use all Agi gems, you will gain 1-2% more dodge, which means instead of getting splatted on the first swing, you get spatted on the second (1 time in 50 when you pull aggro on a boss... and if a guild keeps you around long enough to pull aggro on a boss 50 times, min-maxing isn't your biggest concern)..  There are even some specs and gear levels where Agi is better.  The idea wasn't completely wrong, just the reasoning.</div>

</div>The difference is minimal in damage output and as you said, depends on build. Putting my gear (with a S2 OH) through the spreadsheet gives the following results:<br>
<br>
20/0/41 agi gems<br>
730,98 (baseline)<br>
1297,51 (baseline)<br>
<br>
20/41/0 agi gems<br>
736,77 (0,79%)<br>

20/0/41 hit gems<br>
729,06 (-0,26%)<br>

<br>
20/41/0 hit gems<br>
736,33 (0,73%)<br>
1313,18 (1,19%)<br>

Replacing a 8agi with a 8hit results in -0,4% dodge, and buffed 0,04% dps increase, but only when fully raidbuffed.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">A couple things...<br>
The spreadsheet has not double-dipped on Hemo DPS in a number of versions (fixed in 2.3.2.5).  If Hemo Debuff Estimate is enabled, the Hemo debuff in the buffs section does nothing anymore, so having both on is ok.  You can check this by selecting a Hemo build with Hemo Debuff Estimate on.  Add Hemo debuff under Buffs and you will see the DPS doesn't change anymore.<br>
<br>
The Hemo debuff amounts to a sizable amount of damage now that its up to 42 per tick or 420 per Hemo application which can be multiplied on Crits and other skill/talents/buffs which give damage multipliers while, of course, being mitigated by Armor reduction.  It's not too unreasonable to estimate that the raid could be gaining about 120 dps for the debuff alone over ones own personal damage.  Of course what that means for the WWS parse if the spreadsheet is showing a 30 DPS benefit is that one's personal damage is now somewhere about 90 DPS behind Combat Swords.<br>
<br>
So just as DPS Warriors sometimes wear Solarian's Sapphire to boost raid dps (at the sacrifice of personal DPS), some rogues will be Hemo to boost raid DPS.  I personally see little wrong with that.  I should add that at the point where you are only about 30 DPS with the debuff ahead of Combat Swords, a 2nd Hemo rogue will probably negate just about all of the advantage in occasional debuff overlap.  But if you are the only Hemo Rogue, I'd guess it's still a raid advantage.</div>

</div>So what the sheet does is allow you to eat all your own hemo charges, which in most raids won't happen.<br>
<br>
So as I see it, there's nothing wrong with one shadowstep rogue in the raid. Your overall damage contribution to the raid won't differ much (-1,19% with my gear and some gem corrections) and it's a nice change of play. However, if you care a lot about being high on Recount/DM/etc.. go combat/swords.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>True, at low gear levels, ShStep can end up only a little behind combat swords.  However, at that gear level, tri-spec Hemo is well ahead of both, so that would be your preferred option.  Since the damage added by the Hemo debuff is static and does not scale with gear, Shadowstep will only drop further and further behind.  At around T5/early T6 level, even tri-spec Hemo stops being worth the tradeoff.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>And dead tanks don't tank anything... I don't mean to be disrespectful by any means, but offtanking (or compensating for mistakes) is not your job - damage is. If a tank dies, a Feral druid could much more easily soak up the damage adequately. Not to mention, he's going to actually be able to finish the fight - not just provide a band-aid that's just going to get bled through in 15 seconds (if not sooner). <br>
<br>
You've made it abundantly clear that you think the miniscule amount of dodge gained at the cost of damage output is your decision, and that's fine. But it's an intangible benefit based totally on luck every time the boss takes a swing, and trying to argue that it's a justifiable approach to speccing and gearing your raid rogue isn't going to hold up in here, I'm sorry.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Regarding the Deadly Poison estimate: I think the difference between the frequency of having no poison up and the frequency of having some other number of stacks up is not the same, as the transition table is different, as it's not possible for the number of stacks to drop from, say, 2 to 1 or 5 to 3.  If poison stacks dropped off one at a time, something like that would be possible; since they all drop at once, I don't think it quite works (although I'm having a hard time explaining why).<br>
<br>
That said: I did just have an idea how to improve this model to more accurately reflect the real-world case, but it's getting rather late so I don't have the brainpower to push it through to a solution.  I'll try to do that tomorrow when I'm more awake.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</div>The thing is that when a stack drops from 2 to 0 or 5 to 0 it does come back up through 1 stack or 3 stacks (at least most of the time).  So, to some extent, it is dropping to 1 or 3 just through the predecessors (with a certain dropoff as sometimes it drops before it gets there).  That dropoff can be reflected in the difference between the probability uptimes between a certain stack and its predecessor.  The problem I've seen with other models is that the uptime at various intermediate stacks is generally considered constant which we know can't be the case, as we know it does sometimes drop from say 2 stacks before it reaches 3 stacks.  So, certainly there should be a level of degradation as the stacks increase which this model reflects (the question being whether it reflects it correctly).  I've got some ideas on how to test this model, but not sure when I'll have the time to put it together.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">So what the sheet does is allow you to eat all your own hemo charges, which in most raids won't happen.<br>
<br>
So as I see it, there's nothing wrong with one shadowstep rogue in the raid. Your overall damage contribution to the raid won't differ much (-1,19% with my gear and some gem corrections) and it's a nice change of play. However, if you care a lot about being high on Recount/DM/etc.. go combat/swords.</div>

	</table>
</div>What you are still missing is that there is a "small" DPS loss with the best possible scenario, which would be even smaller with a Tri-Spec (Hemo Buffbot) Build, and you would still get Ghostly Strike, however, in the real world that "small" DPS loss from my experience is really more like 10-15% instead of 1-2%.  <br>
<br>
The ability to stack and chain cooldowns is huge.  If you are looking at a fight like Patchwerk, yes Hemo comes close, however if you look at a fight like Gurtogg or Archimonde or Illidan, where you are running in and out, or you have a phase where you want to control aggro followed by a zerg, then Combat really pulls ahead.  The power of Combat is the highly controlled burst, on Archimonde I can wait for the fear and then blow AR, BF, Drums, and call for Heroism and blow up, where you could... Hemo and S&amp;D and Rupture.  <br>
<br>
As far as having a contingency for screwing up on T4 content... that isn't what most of us are concerned about.  If your tank dies, it isn't the rogue's job to tank, it is the rogue's job to vanish and let the Feral or Warrior get aggro and restabilize.  The truth of the matter is the most rogues who want to raid Shadowstep just don't want to eat the cost of respec'ing for PvP, and they want to PvP as Shadowstep.  If that is the case and the extra DPS doesn't matter (and it doesn't in T4) then more power to you.  But don't try to advocate it for high end raiding, I showed a number of parses of 20/0/41 vs Combat a week or so ago and the results were 10-15% not 1-2%.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>It's irrelevant that you offtanked those bosses for a few seconds. If your tank dies, it's a wipe, and your offtanking isn't going to have any value, except as comedic relief as people shout "ROUGE TANK LAWL"<br>
<br>
You don't learn or practice anything, either, as Rogue tanking has no place in raids. What can you possibly learn in a handful of seconds Evasion tanking? Nothing, aside from the fact that you get one-shotted, and that the healers need to keep the MT alive in the first place. If your 15 seconds of Evasion tanking mean the difference between a 1% wipe and a 1% win, then the extra (considerably higher) dps of Sword spec will be more effective in dropping him before a complete wipe.<br>
<br>
You can try and justify Lolstep in raids as much as you like, but it's not good or DPS-competitive, except for, perhaps, very low-level raids that are easily puggable -- and in that situation, who cares? Maximizing DPS is important for the many fights where you're under an enrage time limit or other timing factors.<br>
<br>
Dodge is useless for a raiding Rogue now that cleaves have basically been eliminated. There is really no effective argument to the contrary, despite your assertions.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>If you're not trying to get it established as a raid build, what are you doing posting? There is no clarification needed here. We all know the difference between Hemo builds' personal DPS and the DPS contributed to the raid. And a "nice change of play" is "ok" on farm content, but since you seem to be advertising the use of agility for mistakes made on progress content, it isn't. While it is true Hemo does give something "substantial" in return (substantial being used in this case as an excuse for doing less DPS overall), tri-spec still beats out Shadowstep.<br>
<br>
What you are saying to Ozzmar is what you should be saying to yourself. You wasted everyone's time on making posts to show you how you either didn't think it through, or how survivability can easily replace stats with common sense and paying attention.<br>
<br>
Even if you are on Lady Vashj running Shadowstep because it may prove more useful, you may not have the rest of the bosses on farm, which means that you are ruining your performance on the rest so you can perform well on another. Otherwise known as an exception to a rule. Of course, you may also consider the rest of bosses on farm. In that case, consider this last paragraph moot.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I would still argue that while the "theoretical DPS loss is only 1-2%" with your gear, the real world loss is far higher, the DPS of Hemo is very consistent, while Combat has far more burst.  The more movement involved, the more value that burst has, for example Blade Flurry  can be up 12.5% of the time, now if you are moving 50% of the time (not unreasonable on Vashj P2), now BF is up 25% of the time you are DPSing, same with AR.  <br>
<br>
For a fight like Vashj you are running all over the place, the ability to blow cooldowns to drop an Elite, or to burn her down during the enrage on phase 3 far outweighs the utility of being able to do something stupid like putting rogues on elementals in phase 2, you are better off sitting the rogue and bringing in an alt warlock if that is what you are trying to do.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_619587"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->On the Deadly Poison debate: I have good news, bad news, good news, bad news, good news, and bad news.<br>
<br>
Good news: I'm pretty sure I've figured out a way to solve the problem in the general case.<br>
<br>
Bad news: Doing so involves computing the eigenvalues of a 20x20 (or so) matrix - which can't be done symbolically in general, meaning that the best we're going to do is a numerical approximation... which is utterly useless, since we can already get that by simply running a simulation.<br>
<br>
Good news: The approach simplifies nicely in the case where poison uptime periods are "long" - that is, where poison usually has time to stack up to 5 before it drops again.<br>
<br>
Bad news: Even solving that requires computing the eigenvalues of a 4x4 matrix, which, while possible in the general case, is so unimaginably messy that it's really not any better as a solution.<br>
<br>
Good news: I think there's a way to bypass the matrix entirely in this simplified case and directly compute what you need.<br>
<br>
Bad news: The details of doing so are sufficiently messy that it's gonna take me a couple days to work it out.<br>
<br>
So, long story short: I have an idea for an approach that I'm pretty sure gets a better answer than we currently have; if you're interested in knowing the details and/or would like to assist with the math, PM me; if there's enough interest, I'll create a upper-division rogue math thread (which I think should probably be called something other than "Roguecraft 201" to avoid confusing the casual forumer) and explain the approach there.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_620718"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->A question for you intelligent folk whom I rather look up to:<br>
<br>
On my forum we have a "DPS Wall of Shame" thread, in which we post WWS reports for various fights and shine a light on melee players who are slacking. After comparing my "buffed DPS" which from my understanding is the max possible DPS I can do, to my obtained numbers on fights such as Leotheras the Blind in SSC, I see that my obtained DPS is lower which only makes sense.<br>
<br>
Is there some sort of generally accepted "formula" for determining the amount of DPS lost due to downtime? I understand that some fights just aren't rogue friendly, but I'm trying to find a way to put exact numbers to this idea.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_620733"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Short answer: no.<br>
<br>
Long answer: For any specific fight, with not unreasonable effort, one could probably come up with a reasonable downtime estimate.  However, in practice, since every fight is different, no concerted effort to do this has occurred.  It's sort of on my to-do list, but it's pretty darn far down the list.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

1. I recently got Talon of Azshara, but I'm currently combat daggers and of course I'm respeccing to Combat swords, But i don't have an offhand sword. Should i continue with combat daggers untill i have an OH sword? Or should i play with Sword in MH and merciless dagger (My current offhand) OH?<br>
<br>
2. Are my stats/gear good for an guild which has just started MH/BT? I know I still have 2t4 , but that's only because of my current dagger specc, (and i find t5 rather sucky, 'cept from gloves). <br>

Its at 249, but im still missing about 5 % ( according to recount )    Right now I have   Alar's  Fist /  Kings defender sword ( didnt have any other off hand sword at the moment , and waiting for one to drop for me )   which i took over my vashj / merc  dagger ( the fist was giving me alot more dps then daggers )   I need to figure out what gear i need to be looking for in Hyjal, and also what gear i missed or should had gotten back in TK, SSC.  <br>
I see some non set items drop, like the Leggings of Murderous Intent dropped last night from kael, and i didnt know if they would had been better then deathmantle legs.   I need to get my future figured out in what i want in gear. Any help would be great thanks. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080314012904im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/biggrin.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":D" class="inlineimg"><br>
<br>
On a side note, i seen that mace Kael drops that restores energy or rage on hit, are their any rogues that use this mace, and like it over other weapons, or is its dps weak compared to other specs.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">So Vulajin would that mean that 1% (aka 15.77 rating) hit is 5.57% better then haste ?

</div>This is what the Rogue DPS Spreadsheet is for. The equivalence of hit and haste is going to be different for every rogue, so there's no black &amp; white answer for you. Go download the spreadsheet, plug your gear and talents into it, and it'll tell you what stats are best for you.<br>
<br>
FromTheAshes,<br>
<br>
Well, that depends on what spec you were using with your dagger(s?). If you were Mutilate, then the commonly-held belief is that you'd see about 10-12% more DPS going Fist/Sword.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Any how, I trying to shape my rogue, into being the most effective, and  getting the best pieces for him to make him optimal.  I have patience to wait for a specific items to drop that will be the best for  me.  I just dont know what I need to be looking for.</div>

</div>What you will find is there is essentially two tiers of gear in T6, so you can wait for the better one or get both.  Based on what I know about AiD's loot system, you want to grab both.  Here are the various items that you want to pick up with items that are better then T5 equivalent, but worse then the optimal item in ().<br>
<br>
Head:  Cursed Visions of Sargeras - Illidan,  (T6 Helm - Archimonde, better until you can get the 4 piece bonus without it)<br>
Neck: Choker of Endless Nightmares - Supremus, (Choker of Serrated Blades - More of a PvP Item)<br>
Shoulders: T6 Shoulders - Mother, (Mantle of Darkness - High Warlord, worth getting because there is normally a couple months between High Warlord and Mother)<br>
Cloak - Shadowmoon Destroyer's Drape - Teron<br>
Chest - T6 Chest - Illidan, (Nethershadow Tunic - Supremus or Midnight Chestguard - Archimonde both are very close and vastly better then anything T5, and it will be a long time before everyone has T6 Chests)<br>
Bracers - Insidious Bands - Teron, (Deadly Cuffs - Rage, Crit is just worse then Agi and these are about 7-8 DPS worse then the Teron ones)<br>
Gloves - T6, ones off RoS aren't worth using<br>
Belt - Belt of One-Hundred Deaths - Vashj (Belt of Deep Shadow - Crafted from SSC/TK or Don Alejandro's from Anetheron)<br>
Legs - T6 - Council, the legs off Kaz'rogal are pretty bad but they are a stem upgrade over T4 and offer some -armor for low AC bosses (all of Hyjal, Teron, Mother and Council)<br>
Boots - Shadowmaster's - Mother, (Blackfeatherlight off Kaz'rogal are basically a DPS sidegrade from Edgewalker's which you already have so not worth picking up except for looks unless they are going to rot)<br>
Rings - Stormrage Signet Ring - Illidan and Signet of Primal Wrath from ZA is ideal (Ring of Deceitful Intent - Shade of Akaman, Ring of Lethality - Hydross and Band of the Ranger General - Kael, are all better then what you have now)<br>
Trinkets - Dragonspine Trophy/Warp-Spring Coil or Ashtongue Talisman of Lethality is ideal, so you really don't need to pick anything up here, if you see a Warp-spring drop, grab it otherwise just wait for the BT Rep Trinket<br>
Weapons - Blade of Infamy - Anetheron and Blade of Savagery - Mother is the best weapon set other then the Warglaives, the daggers are inferior, but probably an upgrade from what you have now (if you can get 2 of them, and they tend to drop like candy). <br>

</div>First off King's Defender on a rogue is a massive failure, get a Latro's or a S1/2/3 OH Sword from PvP, you won't have another option till you get to Mother which won't be for several months at best.  The amount of hit you need depends on your gear, use the gear guild above and gem to get your meta requirements, and stack hit everywhere else.  As long as you stay under 363, you will be fine and really can't go wrong with +10 Hit or +5 Hit/+ Agi gems in every slot.<br>

</div>Going to have to go with use the spreadsheet as I really don't feel like plugging your specific gear into it for you, but I would say that it is well within the range of possibility.  The use of MH Fist/OH Dagger is a bit of a wasted spec, so by going to MH Fist/OH Sword you are going to see an increase, the exact amount depends on too many other variables, but 6-7% is too high for a lower DPS unenchanted OH.  My guess is you got some lucky procs, higher DPS time, better debuffs on the mob or something.  Unless you can provide WWS Parses this is kind of pointless to try to figure out.  There is plenty of information on relative ranking of specs in the first post, and if you have more specific questions consult the spreadsheet or provide a WWS Parse.</div>

</div>-Players and Mobs can't dodge, block or parry while casting or stunned (but an attack can miss still)<br>
-Players and Mobs can't block or parry attacks from behind (which is partly why rogues should ALWAYS attack from behind..)<br>
-Players canNOT dodge attacks from behind<br>
-Mobs CAN dodge attacks from behind<br>

2 additions to what Hanos said a few posts ago - S3 MH sword is better than Blade of Infamy, if you can get it.. do so.  Socketing all +10 hit and +5hit/+5agi is good - as long as you have 2 slots with a blue (likely purple) gem to get your RED Meta requirement.  Generally the idea is to find the best two socket bonuses that require a blue gem and stick a +5agi/+7stam gem in those 2 slots, then fill everything else with either +10 hit (yellow sockets) or +5hit/+5agi (red sockets).  In the gear setup Hanos listed.. that would be T6 Shoulders and Chest.  Armory me if you want an example - note I still need a new belt.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Re: Hit vs Haste<br>
Like Hanos/Ozz said, check the spreadsheet.  In a general sense, hit is nice because it turns a miss (which cannot proc Mongoose, Executioner, DST, Combat Potency, Sword Spec, WF, etc) into a hit (which can proc all that stuff).  However in terms of the damage increase from the extra attacks (ignoring proc'd attacks like SS and WF).. Haste will be better for any moderately geared rogue.<br>
<br>
Example:<br>
5% miss, 4% dodge, 30% crit, ~6% dmg reduction from glancing (not exact, but close enough for demonstration) and the rest will just hit<br>
This works out to (5 * 0) + (4 * 0) + (30 * 2) + (6 * 0) + (50 * 1) = 110% damage per attack.  That is, after averaging out crits, misses, dodges, etc.. you will be doing an average of 110% 'base' damage.  Adding an extra 1% hit does not multiply your dps by 1%, but rather ADDS 1 to the total, giving you 111%.  Adding 1% haste will make you miss, crit, dodge, hit, etc more - a full 1% multiplicative increase in dmg done on your auto attacks.  In this example, that would be 111.1% dmg per attack - a small difference for sure, one which is then balanced out by the increase in procs you get with adding hit rating on PPM effects.<br>
<br>
When you change the hit table a bit you can skew things such that hit will be even better than haste even w/o the extra procs.  For example, a crappy rogue with 15% miss, 6% dodge, 6% glance reduction, 20% crit.. you end up with an average of only 93% dmg per attack.  Haste still multiplies to 93.93%, but hit adds to 94%.<br>
<br>
Change things the other way to 0% miss, 4% dodge, 6% glance reduction and 45% crit, you get a total of 135% dmg per attack - haste now bumps you to 136.35, hit to 136.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
If this is making you go "woah.. you lost me there".. just use and trust the damn spreadsheet - it does this all for you.<br>
(sorry this post was quite unformatted and such)</div>

		<div id="post_message_622536">I believe both spreadsheets show stat equivalences.  If you look toward the bottom of the Talent page, you can see the value of each stat relative to one Agility.  I would normally suggest optimizing it by hitting the Calculate AEP Macro button there, but a few items break that process now.  It may still work for you, but it might not.  If it bugs for you, you will need to unequip a proc related trinket and replace it with something semi-equivalent and click it again.  Either way, you should be able to see the relative relationship between Haste and Hit rating.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Vulajin i use the speed sheet. I was just interested to know if you could make like you said black and white convention of haste to hit. With my current gear only a few items i can find as upgrade. But its ok i will just laborate a bit more i guess with the sheets. Thanks for the reply.</div>

</div>As a general answer to this type of question, there are two points:<br>
<br>
1) Yes, you can make a generalized comparison between two different stats, and the answer to that type of comparison is given by the EP weights in the first post. For a pretty good majority of rogues, those weights will give you a satisfactory comparison of two arbitrary pieces of gear.<br>
<br>
2) The comparison between two different stats <i>does</i> vary depending on your current gear and the buffs you receive in raids. The math for this comparison is sufficiently complex that you should simply use the spreadsheet to obtain an exact comparison for your gear and buffs.</div>

		<div id="post_message_622665">Thanks for the answer to my last post. As I continue to work on this new toon I guess I've slammed into a gemming question. I also know these types of questions are better answered by the DPS spreadsheet but to be honest I don't see where to enter my stats/numbers, so I assumed you only can select your gear and in the event that your item isn't listed then well simply put you can't (so I gave up on it) (I'm probably wrong of course but moving on).<br>
<br>
This is a reroll toon btw (still pre Kara as well).<br>
<br>
Ok to start my stats are as follows.<br>
<br>
Attack Power: 1216<br>
Hit: 232<br>
Crit 17.16% <br>
<br>
Unbuffed my sustained DPS (non raid environment) is 530. I'm not sure if that's even good for those horrid stats to begin with. *could someone respond on this also I want to be sure I am doing my job even if my gear sucks.* <br>
<br>
Ok I have a chance to make a few minor upgrades that will give me 6 gem slots to play with. <br>
<br>
2 red, 1 yellow, that trigger a socket bonus of 4 crit rating.<br>
2 red, 1 blue, that opens up a none dps bonus so won't list it.<br>
<br>
I understand using +4hit/4agi gems in red and +8hit in yellow when trying to get the bonus unless near hit cap. But would throwing 3 x +8 hit in the second item I listed (no useful socket bonus), and then 2 x +4hit/4agi with 1 +8hit in the other item be a wise move?<br>
<br>
All of my stats are so low I'm not sure if I should just balance instead of pumping up one of the items with +hit.<br>
<br>
Side note: I will lose about 30 Attack Power when switching my items to the upgrades. <br>
<br>
Sorry so long.</div>

</div>Thanks again hanos.  I am heading to area 52 right now , because my off hand is something i can take care of right now.  I was thinking , should i stay sword offhand, or get the offhand fist, that way i can spend the sword points else where , like Vile poisons maybe ?  would that be higher dps , or staying fist sword. <br>
<br>
As for the spread sheet, i must have been using an old one or something, becuase it didnt have some of the loot i have on it.  I found the newest and updated one..  Only thing it said was  in the upper right and left corner  ( where it says import armory ectect .. ) is this will not work with open office.  <br>
<br>
i dont have Microsoft excel , and the free trial one I downloaded  does not allowed Macros to be enabled, or really any thing enabled.<br>
I am not sure how else i can import my armory unless i buy excel ..  any help with that ? <br>
Thank you.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Going to have to go with use the spreadsheet as I really don't feel like plugging your specific gear into it for you, but I would say that it is well within the range of possibility.  The use of MH Fist/OH Dagger is a bit of a wasted spec, so by going to MH Fist/OH Sword you are going to see an increase, the exact amount depends on too many other variables, but 6-7% is too high for a lower DPS unenchanted OH.  My guess is you got some lucky procs, higher DPS time, better debuffs on the mob or something.  Unless you can provide WWS Parses this is kind of pointless to try to figure out.  There is plenty of information on relative ranking of specs in the first post, and if you have more specific questions consult the spreadsheet or provide a WWS Parse.</div>

Yeah i just used the one for open office.   I got every thing filled in exactly to how my character is. <br>

But something is wrong..<br>

The Spread sheet has my Current hit as 262  but in reality in the gamne its only 249<br>
The spread sheet says my Optimal hit is 248 but in game .. who knows.. but i do know according to Recount dmg meter i still am showing about a 6.9 % miss rate. <br>

Those numbers arent backwards either, its exactly what the spread sheet says. <br>

</div>Comments:<br>
<br>
1) When displaying damage comparisons between the main builds, it seems to me that you're reporting them to rather more significant figures that we reasonably can know.  Or more accurately: the accuracy with which they are stated implies that it's differences between very specific sets of gear/buffs/etc, rather the general difference between specs (which would have more variance).  So I might report them to at most a tenth of a percent if not the whole percent.<br>
<br>
2) I'm not sure "<b>There is no "minimum" chance to miss melee attacks, nor to be dodged or parried.</b>" needs to be bolded.  I think most people have gotten the idea on this one already, so while it's still a good piece of information to state, it doesn't really need to be emphasized.<br>
<br>
3) It's actually not 100% clear to me that Thundering Skyfire Diamond beats Swift Skyfire Diamond in the general case.  I mean, I'm nitpicking a bit, but: it means you can replace Cat's Swiftness with Dexterity on boots, and don't need to socket blue gems for metagem requirements, so you're really getting something like 6 agi and 8 hit in addition to the 24 attack power, which actually makes SSD somewhat competitive with TSD.<br>
<br>
More to the point: the only situation where you *wouldn't* use RED would be it for some reason you can't get the metagem requirements for it... meaning you can't use TSD either.  So there's absolutely no reason you would ever want to use TSD.<br>
<br>
Of course, really, there's no reason not to just use RED, so I might just rephrase that section to have more of a "use RED.  Period.  Nothing else comes close" feel to it.<br>
<br>
4) While we're nitpicking: with the posted stat weightings (which, honestly, feel a bit off to me in some places, but that's sort of a separate issue) rank Balanced Nightseye ahead of Shifting Nightseye for all gear levels.  Now, clearly with Kings Shifting does come out ahead, but it might be worth noting that if one consistantly raids without Kings, and particularly at low gear levels, Balanced can be worth using as well as Shifting.  You mention this for Hemo, but it applies to Combat s well.<br>
<br>
5) While we're on the topic of stat weightings: am I correct in assuming that you made these stat estimates with very few AP buffs?  Since, for instance, with the default gear in the 0.9.3 Gear Sheet (which is mid-to-high end T6), I get very different stat weightings:<br>
<br>
Str: 1.1<br>
Agi 2.3<br>
Crit: 1.9<br>
Hit: 2.64<br>
Expertise: 2.9<br>
Armor Pen: .33<br>
Haste 2.26<br>
Metagem: 102<br>
<br>
Which is really pretty different than what you have posted.  I suspect the answer is one of buffs, but I don't think the default buffs in the Gear sheet are *that* unreasonable for  T6 guild, so... if you're posting extremely low-buff numbers, it might be worth making note of that fact; and I for one would recommend posting higher-buff numbers, since, lets be honest, how many rogues raid without Blessing of Might and Battle Shout, even if they don't have much else?<br>
<br>
6) On Unique gems: I question the inclusion of the PvP crit rating gems; for many rogues, 10 crit is still inferior to 8 hit.  Also note that as of 2.4, some of these gems will no longer be unique.<br>
<br>
7) On totems: it might be worth noting that ret pallies in your group is almost a guarantee that you will get WF.  It may additionally be worth saying a few words about totem twisting - that some shamans do it, basically.  Fundamentally, the message here should probably be "Check if your shaman is using WF, and, if not, use IP MH".</div>

		<div id="post_message_623434">1) You're correct that they're based on a particular set of gear and buffs. Specifically, the tier 4 rankings for each build also assume the same gear and buffs used to determine the tier 4 EP weights. It's likely that including two-digit decimal precision for the differences encourages more of a distinction between each build than can reasonably be made, since slight differences in buffs and gear may shift the relative rankings. I'll fix that up.<br>
<br>
2) Fair enough, but I feel that the "minimum chance to miss melee attacks" and "minimum required level of hit" theories will never die out as long as idiots play this game.<br>
<br>
3) Quite right, will be changed.<br>
<br>
4) Also true, but rather than address this immediately I'll address the next point first.<br>
<br>
5) The tier 4 EP weights definitely assume a rather different selection of buffs than the tier 5 and tier 6 ones. The tier 4 weights assume a set of buffs that a rogue might have in a 10-man raid; so there's no Blessing of Might (one paladin providing Salvation was assumed), but there is Battle Shout. There's assumed to be a shaman providing Windfury, but not Unleashed Rage. The tier 5 and tier 6 weights, on the other hand, assume a much stronger set of buffs, including Blessing of Might, Unleashed Rage, and Leader of the Pack. I considered adding Expose Weakness but I'm not sure if survival hunters are used by a representative majority of raiding guilds, even at tier 6.<br>
<br>
As for why the weights differ so greatly from what your sheet suggests, I'm at a loss. I'll do some double-checking to make sure I haven't screwed anything up.<br>
<br>
6) This is also likely related to issue number 5. Also, the 2.4 change is already noted in the section.<br>
<br>
7) I'll tweak the section a bit.</div>

There's nothing all that surprising.   From the looks of it, the WWS is of Teron and a high dps one so I assume it's a farm status full T6 group.   At that level of gear SS scales to be better than doing Ruptures so 5s/5r is just fine.<br>
<br>
Though, it's a bit weird to advocate it when it's a KZ level rogue asking about cycles and 2pc T4 bonus in that thread.   At that level and gear, Rupture should be used more with the 1s/5r with T4.<br>

</div>By performing a longer cycle you are essentially trading Rupture damage for Sinister Strike damage. Since Sinister Strike scales better than Rupture, there is a point at which it becomes better to concentrate your energy using SS whenever possible (Read: running the longest possible cycle, 5s/5r). <br>
<br>
I'm not sure what that inflection point is but you can clearly see this fact by looking at the value of 2pc T4 to a Karazhan-geared rogue vs a T6-geared rogue. The former will gain much more benefit, since his stats are lower, to doing additional Ruptures, while the guy in T6 will gain much less of a benefit from trading some SS damage for Rupture damage.</div>

</div>In fact, when doing 5 pt finishers, you will always get the refund. The reason 5s/5r is better at high gear levels is because you're spending 0 energy on finishers at the expense of a longer cycle (i.e. less rupture uptime). However, since SS scales better than rupture, when you reach higher gear levels, you're far better off spending most of your time SS'ing. But since a 5 pt rupture is free damage, you use it whenever you can.<br>
<br>

		<div id="post_message_623889">So, to be clear on the rupture vs SS debate:<br>
<br>
When you do 5s5r, you are spending no energy whatsoever on finishers, as Relentless Strikes always gives a full refund.  Hence all energy is being spent on SS.<br>
<br>
When you do, say, 3s5r, on average you will spend 10 point of energy per cycle on finishers; hence, this is 10 energy not being spent on Sinister Strike.  Hence, you are having fewer Sinister Strikes per unit time, in exchange for having a shorter cycle and thus higher rupture uptime.  And all but the highest gear levels, the higher rupture uptime proves to be worth more damage than the Sinister Strikes, so the compressed cycle is better.  However, at ultra-high gear levels - end T6 rogues with MH Warglaive and lots of raid buffs - the damage done by Sinister Strikes actually catches up to the Rupture damage, and 5s5r becomes the more damaging cycle.</div>

In this sense, I'm advocating its use for raid leader or other rogues who have duties that require slighly less than 100% attention on noticing exactly when you get CPot procs and whatnot.  I've been using 5s/5r (though now that I just got the Vashj belt, I'm getting a 2.9s/5r recommendation so I may have to switch .. :E) and it's been doing fine.  I gain a slight amount of DPS by not falling out of a cycle that's hard to maintain when I'm swapping people's groups and trying to pan cameras around to see who's standing in Vashj BatPoo and stuff.</div>

		<div id="post_message_624410">Hello all, I have been struggling lately on what rotation to use, according to the spreadsheet the suggest rotation would be 3s/5r, deciding to test that out, I went to the good old blasted lands and found myself a Servant of Allistarj to test the aforementioned rotation on. The outcomes left me puzzled, I have to admit I was sure to achieve some better results. <br>
Recount tells me I averaged 953.6 dps on a lvl 55 mob, thus having the upperhand in terms of weapon skill vs monster defense skill. I was using IP MH and DP in OH, using the rotation (starting with SS activating SnD, getting to 3cp refreshing the SnD then all the way up to 5cp and rupture) I found myself unable to keep it for a long, there were times in which I was  at 5 cp with my previous rupture still ticking and 9 seconds left, and times in which i had like 6 seconds left on SnD and only with 3 or 4 CPs. In order to keep the SnD always up and running I found myself relying a lot on combat potency procs (according to recount noone of my weapon swings missed) and ruthlessness ones. I had sporadically times in which with this rotation SnD was down, be them half second or 2-3 seconds long, before I had 3 cps in order to refresh it. <br>
Now the question that comes to mind, If I cant' keep up that rotation against a lvl 55 monster thus getting the most out of talents like Combat Potency, I assume that against a lvl 73 raid boss the things can only get worst. Should I use a 3 or 4 cp rupture being the difference in ticks minimal, or the loss of the free finisher will make the situation even worst?<br>
<br>
PS, I was unbuffed on this small test and did not used skills like Blade furry or AR, nor trinkets (BL brooch, Abacus).</div>

As we know in the lastest Patch Mace Spec have been changed To Crit chance just like fist weapons and it adds a stun effect.. now.. what i dont understand is.. <br>
<br>
How you can Get Fist+Sword spec and Combat Fist Spec  to do more damage than Mace+sword and Combat Mace spec.?<br>
as they are basicly the same spec.. only thing that changes it is that the mace spec add an xtra effect when you spec it.<br>
<br>
Are you testing with same level weapons ? Fx. like pvp ones with same speed and stats ?<br>
<br>
<u>Tier 4:<br>
</u><br>
   1. Combat swords (--) / Combat fist+sword (-0.12%) / Combat daggers (-0.51%)<br>
   2. Combat fists (-1.10%) / <b>Combat mace+sword (-1.80%)</b><br>
   3. <b>Combat maces (-3.27%)</b><br>
   4. Hemo+swords (-5.06%) / Hemo+Combat Potency (swords) (-5.62%)<br>
   <br>
<br>
<u><br>
Tier 5:</u><br>
<br>
   1. Combat swords (--) / Combat fist+sword (-0.22%)<br>
   2. <b>Combat mace+sword (-1.15%)</b> / Combat fists (-1.45%) / Combat daggers (-1.49%)<br>
   3. <b>Combat maces (-2.64%)</b><br>

<br>
   1. Combat swords (--) / Combat fist+sword (-0.29%) / <b>Combat mace+sword (-0.93%)</b><br>
   2. Combat fists (-1.71%)<br>

   4. Combat daggers (-3.16%)<br>
   <br>
<br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
So here we are with my final question.<br>
<br>
I just want to know the fact behind that fists dos more damage than mace's after the revamp in the Mace spec talant ?<br>

</div>An excellent observation.  Also note the complete lack of prot warrior in the raid (intentional), the Expose Armor debuff on Gorefiend and my 2/2 Imp Expose Armor talent selection.<br>
<br>
I lose marginal personal dps, all other physical dps (3 hunters, 1 other rogue, 2 dps warrior, 2 cats, bear MT, 2 enhancement shams, 1 ret pally.. we stacked melee....) get a 2-4% dps boost over sunder.  If you dig REALLY deep you'll even notice that he parried an Expose Armor - wow did that throw me.<br>
<br>
Good find tho <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080228034208im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/wink.gif" border="0" alt="" title=";)" class="inlineimg">  Flateous and I try and take turns doing Imp EA each week, if he's able to make this weeks Teron, I'm shooting for 2500 dps (just got 4pc T6).  Definitely worth having 1 rogue do Imp EA if you don't have a prot warrior in the raid, probably still well worth it with a prot warrior dps'ing on a single-tank boss.</div>

[quote=cmecu;622768]Thanks again hanos.  I am heading to area 52 right now , because my off hand is something i can take care of right now.  I was thinking , should i stay sword offhand, or get the offhand fist, that way i can spend the sword points else where , like Vile poisons maybe ?  would that be higher dps , or staying fist sword. <br>
<br>
Get the sword!  Looking at your amory it looks like you already did.  There is a very good sword, that drops very frequently from the second boss in Hyjal, however there is no Fist weapons in T6.  The OH sword will serve you well with both a fist or sword MH, the OH fist will be worse then the sword in every situation.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I was talking with another rogue on my server and he said I had "too much" hit rating compared to my AP/crit.  Is there any validity to this statement?  I currently have unbuffed 322 hit rating, 1712 attack power, and 22.67% crit.  Like, is there some sort of mathematical "good" ratio to have?</div>

</div>No, odds are he is an idiot.  As others have said, you can't have too much hit until you go over 363, however, you can make stupid gearing decisions like using <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080228034208/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=30372"><span  ><span class="bluename">[Socrethar's Girdle]</span></span></a> over <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080228034208/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=30106"><span  ><span class="purplename">[Belt of One-Hundred Deaths]</span></span></a>, because you would lose hit.  Basically if you are using the best items available to you and gemming for hit, you will be fine, if you are not using better items because you would lose hit, that could be an issue.  A low crit rating isn't a bad thing and isn't uncommon with swords, you really don't start to see higher crit rates until late T5 or T6 (when  you can't avoid it on gear).<br>

</div>Rupture does scale better than Sinister Strike by itself, and if we were talking about swapping out Sinister Strikes for 5 point Ruptures directly, you'd be right.  However, the situation is slightly more sophisticated than that, since we're trading SS damage for a slightly shorter cycle which thus implicitly increases rupture uptime; hence, there's a weighting factor that aids Sinister Strike in this matter.  I'm not going to go through absolutely all the details (you can find them in the spreadsheet if you want them, which demonstrates this effect rather clearly), but the gist of it is as follows:<br>
<br>
A 3s5r cycle requires 6.8 SS and 1 Rupture, which costs a total of 282 energy.  Using your numbers, a Rupture does 1000 + .24 * AP damage, and a Sinister Strike 649.3 + .2761 * AP.  Thus, the 6.8 SS + 1 Rupture of 3s5r do a total of 5415 + 2.12 * AP damage.  Dividing by 282 gives the DPE of this cycle component as 19.2 + 7.52 kAP.<br>
<br>
A 5s5r cycle requires 8.8 SS and 1 Rupture, which costs a total of 352 energy.  Again with your numbers, these attacks do a totalk of 6714 + 2.67 AP * damage.  Dividing by 352 we find that the DPE of this cycle component is 19.1 + 7.59 kAP.<br>
<br>
Equating these two, we find the crossover point occurs at 1900 AP; that is, under 1900 AP, 3s5r has better DPE; over 1900 AP, 5s5r has better DPE.<br>
<br>
Now, of course, the stats you specify are a bit unrealistic even for a full T6 rogue, so in reality the breakpoint is usually a bit higher than this; but as a raid-buffed T6 rogue can easily have 3k AP with 40%+ crit and 500 ArPen, it is very much possible to get to the point where 5s5r catches up with 3s5r.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">That parse is "interesting", I am more curious how he managed to vanish 2 items in a 2:26 fight, but yeah, the lack of Rupture or any finisher other then S&amp;D makes me think there is something wrong with the parse.</div>

</div>Pretty sure the 2xVanish thing is an artifact of the way vanishes are logged; if you watch the combat log, you get two separate Vanish messages, "You cast Vanish" and "You gain Vanish" (or something like that) - one for the actual spell, and one for the resulting buff.  WWS isn't smart enough to track this, so all vanishes show up as two vanishes.</div>

Let EA drop for like 4 seconds when the parry happened, completely wasn't expecting my finisher to not.. finish (we're all spoiled by Surprise attacks I guess, damn those "boss spin around instant cast" spells).

				<div style="font-style:italic">I'm wanting to get some WWS parses of soem of my guilds fights going and just thought to myself, "Everyone says the wws and recap/recount/swstats will be diff".  Anyone know how far off wws parses are from most dmg meters? I normally run SWStats and have yet to see any of our locks/rogues (even with glaive OH) parse 2700dps for gorefiend.  Then, I look at the site and see hundreds of rogues parsing that with sub 3:30 gorefiend fights.  Thoughts, ideas?</div>

</div>I don't know about hundreds, you have to stack the hell out of a group, hit them with heroisms, drums, etc to break 2500, breaking 2700 is even tougher.  WWS will be higher then SWS/Recap/Recount, because it does individual calculations for time in combat, whereas the rest are based on the raids time in combat (to some degree).  You aren't going to see 2700 DPS individuals on a 3:30 kill unless you hit that group with every heroism in the raid.  <br>
<br>
To get 2700 you are going to have to be well under 3 mins for the most part, unless you know something I don't.  However, please link all of these 2700 DPS parses, because I am seeing a couple people just over 2700 in the top 10 or so, but never more then 1 per raid, and in the case of rogues they are all MH Warglaive rogues with Dragonspines (which on the other hand makes me feel pretty good about my 2583 last week without either).</div>

		<div id="post_message_624997">Yep.  There really isn't any other valid rotation - you can't "increase your ea uptime" like you can with rupture.  All you could possibly do is squeak in an extra small rupture once in a fight that length.<br>
<br>
In such a short fight, my main goal is just to get EA up as FAST as possible - I burn AR 5-10 sec into the fight to get EA up as soon as possible.  The slightly smaller SS's I get by burning AR while Teron has higher armor is easily compensated by the massive gains all the physical dps gets by having EA up sooner.  I typically go with:<br>
Garrote, SS, SnD, SS, AR, SS to 5 CP, EA.<br>
This is where I either get lucky or it gets tight.  If I proc'd ruthlessness, I'm ok.  If I got a few combat potency procs, I'm fine.  If neither happened - I'm generally around 2 seconds left on SnD with no combo points.  Either way.. I SnD as soon as I can in the bad case, or as late as I can in the good case (2-3 combo point SnD, refreshing at the last second).<br>
<br>
At that point I have ~25-30 seconds on EA and ~13-21 seconds on SnD.  I generally go for a 3-5 second SnD at this point, making sure I leave enough time after I hit it to get 5 points up for EA.  I find doing SnD with around 15 sec left on EA is generally ok.  Given the previous 25-30 seconds on EA, this means I have 10-15 sec to get my 3-5 combo points for SnD.<br>
<br>
After that I can slide into a much more comfortable 5s/5ea cycle for the remainder of the fight.. all 60 seconds of it *sigh*.<br>

Edit: I'm several posts behind.. taking me 30 min to write stuff cause I'm at work :P</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Does the 4 points in deadliness change the Atk. Power ep to 1.08?  If that is the case, then doesn't that influence the strength and agility values also?<br>
<br>
Also as a feature request, can you add a column for a shadowstep build?  I'm mostly interested in seeing the ep weights with sinister calling and deadliness and how they compare to all the other builds.</div>

</div>To your first question, no, because 1 EP is defined as the DPS contribution provided by 1 point of AP on a piece of gear for your particular spec. Whether you have Deadliness or not, that 1 point of AP provides a certain amount of DPS contribution. By definition, 1 AP cannot provide more than 1 EP regardless of talents.<br>
<br>
To your second question, absolutely not. Shadowstep is an inferior build regardless of your gear or weapons. Even if you are fixated on speccing Hemo to provide the debuff, you are better off speccing Hemo+swords if you have swords, or Hemo+Deadliness if you have a different weapon type. There is no reason to ever spec Shadowstep for PvE.</div>

</div>If you are at 1900, WWS isn't going to show you at 2500 or 2700 for Teron, odds are you guys simply aren't killing him fast enough to see those kind of numbers (the value of Heroism increases significantly the shorter the fight).  Last week WWS showed me at 2563 for Teron, SWS and Recount were at around 2530.  The only time you are going to have significant differences between WWS and in-game meters is when you aren't attacking and other members of the raid are (Illidan and Supremus are good examples of this).  On Teron, odds are you are attacking from a couple seconds after the pull until he dies, so your DPS time is very close to the raid combat time.<br>
<br>
If you are looking to get a 2500 DPS Parse you really need to get well under 3 mins for the kill, which means you need to raid committed to buffing.  Stacking Drums, Heroism (probably need 2 of them), and chaining haste pots will also help.  Ideally you want a Survival Hunter, a MS Warrior, CoR, FF, 5x Sunder (or talented EA), as well as full buffs.  Beyond that it is just DPS like hell.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">To your first question, no, because 1 EP is defined as the DPS contribution provided by 1 point of AP on a piece of gear for your particular spec. Whether you have Deadliness or not, that 1 point of AP provides a certain amount of DPS contribution. By definition, 1 AP cannot provide more than 1 EP regardless of talents.<br>
<br>
To your second question, absolutely not. Shadowstep is an inferior build regardless of your gear or weapons. Even if you are fixated on speccing Hemo to provide the debuff, you are better off speccing Hemo+swords if you have swords, or Hemo+Deadliness if you have a different weapon type. There is no reason to ever spec Shadowstep for PvE.</div>

</div>I should instead put it this way: the purpose of the post is to help any rogue improve his or her DPS. So that's obviously the intent of the EP weights, to help rogues make informed gear choices to improve their DPS. However, by far the greatest piece of advice I could give a Shadowstep rogue would be to respec something else. As a result, including further information for Shadowstep rogues beyond that is pretty much unnecessary.<br>
<br>
Mutilate is missing primariily because we don't really have a good source for Mutilate DPS or gearing info beyond empirical evidence. We're reasonably confident that Mutilate is inferior to combat daggers, hence why a great deal of effort hasn't been expended towards creating better models of Mutilate DPS.</div>

</div>Your entire server seems to be saturated with idiots.  There is no optimal hit rating.  Its not 100, its not 200, its not 300.. there just is no optimal amount.  In fact, generally speaking hit becomes BETTER then more of it you have.  This is due largely to WF and to a lesser extent sword spec, both of which require a landed attack to proc another attack.<br>
<br>
169 hit rating is in fact quite low and almost difficult to achieve in anywhere near reasonable gear.  Don't pick gear based on the hit rating it has (or doesn't have...).  Pick gear based on what does more DPS.  Hit is a good stat, and you should be (generally) gemming for it - but it is NOT the only stat.</div>

		<div id="post_message_625845">I'm quite puzzled by those statements. Anyone who has read and understood this thread would easily be able to tell them otherwise. I'm thinking that they are just basing this off some weird fluke that made them do more dps with this particular number, and they consider it "magic" now.<br>
<br>
the other foundation I could think of for it would be that they'd assume you get less return on hit rating once your specials are hitcapped at 9% (142 rating w/o precision). The number is a bit off, but it's viable. not sure why they wouldn't include precision in the calculation though.<br>
<br>
Short answer:<br>
Their statement is complete and utter rubbish, and hit continues to be an excellent stat all the way up until 363 rating (with precision) whereafter it is all but useless. <br>
<br>
(Like others have pointed out; bear in mind that hit is not the panacea to rogue dps, and you should consider the total dps of an equipment piece, and not just the hit rating. I myself have a slightly low hitrating, but this is mostly due to wearing the vastly superior Shadowtooth Trollskin Cuirass over for example Conniver's (one of the few others available to me at our progression level))</div>

		<div id="post_message_625868">I have a question or two here about trinket/ability timing, namely when to start busting them out during a fight.<br>
<br>
Normally on a boss, I sit back and wait for the tank to hit 5k threat before doing anything (I'm not even auto-attacking, simply sitting and waiting). Once the tank hits that marker, I hop in SS once, SnD, then pop Abacus + Haste Pot + Blade Flurry + AR. The timing on it works well with regard to cooldowns, as on a standard fight I can get in 2-3 of my 2min CD's and an extra AR if the fight runs long. Lately it gives me threat problems with our weaker tanks and leads me to an early vanish and having to back off late in the fight, but I'm getting better at curtailing my trinkets/abilities when I know the tank will have problems with me.<br>
<br>
So, my questions. First, would it be better to wait on popping my cooldowns a little bit longer into the fight until, say, I've run one full 1s/5r cycle? This should give the tank a little more time to take a threat lead and keep me from an early vanish and late back-off. Second, should I split the use of AR off of the rest, as in wait to pop it until the other abilities have run their course?<br>
<br>
The main reason I pop things right away now is to get as many uses of each ability, trinket and potion per fight as possible. For some reason lately, though, I seem to be having issues building too much threat too early. Most of the time it is on our weaker tanks that are subbing in on a fight, but from time to time I even catch our great tanks as well. Nothing has changed on my end, no changes to rotations, haven't gotten a gear upgrade in months. So I'm overall just curious if there's a better timing for my cooldown use to 1) increase DPS and/or 2) manage my threat better. And, of course, I realize that I may not  be able to mutually do both 1 and 2.</div>

		<div id="post_message_626024">I would say that you should hold off on using AR until after your trinket/BF have run their cycle, and you have started your first 1s/5r cycle.  This will allow you to start dpsing when the tank is at 3.5-4k threat, as well as allow for the tank to get a little further ahead before you start making your tps go crazy.<br>
<br>
You shouldn't catch your tank until you are about to use your second AR, in which case you will want to vanish just before using it.<br>
I personally make sure that I vanish just after a 5r, then garrote and use a 1s just before using AR.  During the AR, since I already have a 5r ticking, I will use the first 5cp for evisc. and use the second 5cp for another rupture.  I usually have enough time at the end to ss if ruthlessness didn't proc so that I can keep SnD up without letting it drop.<br>
<br>
Using this I am always able to keep Rupture and SnD up for the duration of a boss fight, with ease.<br>
<br>
If you're having to back off on dps later in the fight it is a problem with your tanks tps.</div>

</div>As others have said already, your friends are idiots, reread the first post of this thread for more info.  Basically if you stick to items designed for rogues, pick the highest item level ones, and then gem for hit/socket bonus/meta requirements (aka getting 4 more AP isn't worth using 2 purples and losing out on the equivalent of 16 AP or more), as long as you don't go over 363, with a standard combat build hit is going to be the most valuable stat point for point that you can get.  Mutilate and Deep Sub Agility can be as valuable to slightly more but that is all covered elsewhere.<br>
<br>
I want to say 19.6% with precision was the cap before the expansion, but as gear choices were FAR more limited you really didn't have a ton of choices (aka you had your set, AQ Gear or your next tier set), which would have been 196, however it came in increments of 10 so I have no idea where 169 comes from other then someone being a complete idiot or intentionally screwing with people (which has been known to happen "Hey, you want to do crazy raid DPS, go 0/0/61 and max out your Strength, IT'S A SECRET).<br>

</div>It would help to know what content this refers to, because I don't know about you, but we use Misdirects, and the tank normally has 5k threat as soon as he reaches the mob.  However, generally you don't want to use cooldowns until all the debuffs are applied, so that you get the maximum benefit out of them.  Based on your gear it looks like you are in T5 Content, so I would open up with SS, S&amp;D, 5pt Rupture, SS, S&amp;D, then blow your cooldowns, if this would put you over the threat cap (110%), then do another cycle first and make sure all the debuffs are up (Sunder, CoR, Faerie Fire, Mangle, etc.).  Vanish at 75-80% of the bosses health, and you should have a very hard time catching back up to the tank.  If you need to weave in a couple feigns to prevent energy capping or pulling aggro do it.<br>
<br>
Also, what fights are you having issues on?  For example in T5 Morogrim the tank is typically going to start slow and then build up, since he is a little rage starved until the big hits start coming regularly (gets a debuff that slows attack speed and thus Heroic/Auto Attacks).  Hydross also hits like a girl until he starts getting stacked up.  Generally in T5 you are going to have to hold back a little more on some fights early on due to the mechanics.  You are better off starting slow, weaving feigns (not something I generally recommend), then you are not attacking and then jumping in and blowing all your CDs.</div>

</div>If only there was a spreadsheet to answer difficult questions like this...<br>
<br>
General rule (may not apply based on gear, group set up, buffs, debuffs, consumable, phase of the moon, etc):<br>
Wear 2/5 T4 until you can get 4/5 T5<br>
Wear 4/5 T5 until you can get 2/5 T6<br>
Wear 2/5 T6 until you can get 4/5 T6 (ok just too lines didn't look like enough general rules)<br>
Wear 4/5 T6 until you can get more DPS from Sunwell Loot.<br>
<br>
Easier answer plug it into the spreadsheet.  There are some cases where you are better off breaking 2/4 T4 due to the fact that the T5 gloves are a huge upgrade.  My guess is Shoulderpads of the Stranger, T5 Gloves, T4 Legs and Chest is going to be your best bet, but plug it into the Spreadsheet and find out.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">It would help to know what content this refers to, because I don't know about you, but we use Misdirects, and the tank normally has 5k threat as soon as he reaches the mob.  However, generally you don't want to use cooldowns until all the debuffs are applied, so that you get the maximum benefit out of them.  Based on your gear it looks like you are in T5 Content, so I would open up with SS, S&amp;D, 5pt Rupture, SS, S&amp;D, then blow your cooldowns, if this would put you over the threat cap (110%), then do another cycle first and make sure all the debuffs are up (Sunder, CoR, Faerie Fire, Mangle, etc.).  Vanish at 75-80% of the bosses health, and you should have a very hard time catching back up to the tank.  If you need to weave in a couple feigns to prevent energy capping or pulling aggro do it.<br>
<br>
Also, what fights are you having issues on?  For example in T5 Morogrim the tank is typically going to start slow and then build up, since he is a little rage starved until the big hits start coming regularly (gets a debuff that slows attack speed and thus Heroic/Auto Attacks).  Hydross also hits like a girl until he starts getting stacked up.  Generally in T5 you are going to have to hold back a little more on some fights early on due to the mechanics.  You are better off starting slow, weaving feigns (not something I generally recommend), then you are not attacking and then jumping in and blowing all your CDs.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</div>As far as content, yes, we're on T5 working on downing Vashj (which becomes rough when you have some people that can't ever seem to follow directions). Specific fights would indeed be Morogrim, and every once in a while on Hydross, and we do use Misdirects. I had a hell of a time managing threat on Morogrim last week for some reason. Had to do him twice due to a healing mistake, and the first attempt I overran the tank within about 15-20sec. On the second attempt, I decided to slow down and waited for a complete 1s/5r cycle to do anything. Then I popped only my haste CD's but not AR, and within about 20sec I had to vanish because I caught the tank again. I've never had problems like that before on Morogrim, and I didn't change my approach from previous attempts.<br>
<br>
I suppose scaling back at the start of the fight might be in order for me, both for threat reasons and other ones that you mentioned (full debuffs applied) that I stupidly hadn't thought about. One more question, though. You mentioned vanishing at roughly 80% of the mob's health. Is there a specific advantage to doing this as opposed to waiting to vanish until you're closer to threat capping? Generally on fights where it doesn't matter who's secondary on the threat list, I try to ride my tank as close as possible before vanishing. Or should 80% generally be when I end up catching the tank anyway?</div>

		<div id="post_message_626314">A few things regarding the DPS Spreadsheet...<br>
If you want Evis numbers you can easily turn Rupturable off in the options to the right of the Talents on the Talent page.  This option is there for a reason...<br>
<br>
Stamina is given zero weight in the DPS Spreadsheet.  As your gear improves, you get a fair amount of stamina anyway.  Play your character correctly and I can think of no reason one should get killed.  Besides, what's 10 Stamina anyway?  100 health?  How often have you screwed up and asked, "if I only had 100 more health?"  I think it's entirely more common to experience (so tank dies), hmm..."if only I had 600 more Stamina, I could have survived that 17k crushing."<br>
<br>
Now, I'm not saying it's 0 value, but with proper play, it shouldn't really come into question especially since upper level gear tends to have a fair amount of inherent Stamina.  Regardless, the value of Stamina is not DPS.  You can look at the DPS numbers in the box at the top.  Also up top one can look at one's health.  You certainly have the option of switching gear around to add health while minimizing DPS loss.  The sheet is there to be used as you wish it to be.  There are many options and I'm sure people use it in different ways.</div>

</div>As far as Morogrim goes, yes if you open up with all your cooldowns right away you are going to have issues, read up on the mechanics of the fight some more to understand why your tank's threat is going to suck at first, same with Hydross for the reasons I mention, Hydross wait until you have 15 seconds before the switch to use your CD's.  Also, as you tank gears up, Morogrim will start off even slower due to dodge/parry strings.  Don't plan to use CD's on Morogrim until around 90% or so, to give your tank time to get a lead and to start generating consistent threat.<br>

</div>See the bolded part.  80% is a good rule of thumb and on a lot of threat sensitive fights I can typically hover right under the tank to that point, vanish, then go ape-shit on the boss and not worry about catching him.  Around 80% is when you should be making up the initial difference from the misdirect.  However, Hydross and Morogrim are exceptions due to the fact that the tank isn't going to generate as much threat right away.</div>

</div>As far as Eviscerate goes, there's no reason under *normal* conditions you would ever use Eviscerate over Rupture (yes, there was some math showing that when 4/5 T5 buff is up, you have a ton of AP/Crit, the boss is well debuffed, and mangle is not up, Evisc is the slightly better option, but that's by far the exception). Therefore inherently there's no reason to give the 2pc bonus any value at all, since you'd never be using it for what the spreadsheet models: a tank n' spank fight with no quirks.<br>
<br>
Of course you're free to calculate how many times you'd actually use Eviscerate in a certain fight, the damage gain from using the 2pc T5 bonus, and divide that by your time on-target. Then you have a rough DPS estimate for the 2pc bonus which you can put in on the set bonuses tab for the Gear Sheet. Of course since you're looking at quirky (not tank n' spank) fights there's a ton of other factors which would affect gear selection much more than that bonus, such as the increased value of agility, the lower armor of boss adds, etc. <br>
<br>
To address the stamina issue, stamina is taken into concern in the Gear Sheet if you're using the "Weighted" totals. Of course it doesn't add to your DPS, and you change the amount of stamina which equals one EP for item selection purposes. Why is stamina modeled? As Aldriana put it before, stamina has some amount of value. Would you trade 1 DPS for 1 Stamina? Probably not. But I'd certainly take 100 stamina over 1 DPS.</div>

Fundamentally: when the tank dies (or you pull aggro) and the boss starts wailing on you, stamina isn't going to save you (though dodge might, but that's another story).  However, when you get aggro on Hyjal trash (which happens) or are being hit by the raid damage of a boss (Ice Bolt on Rage, Rain of Fire on Azgalor, Doomfire/Air Burst/both on Archimonde, plus various and assorted effects on over half the bosses in BT) stamina can - and does - make a difference.  And while good healing can reduce the need for this, taking some of the burden off your healers is not a bad thing.  So I subscribe to the philosophy that while stamina (and dodge) are significantly less important than DPS stats, there is a point at which one can say "losing X amount of DPS is worth Y stamina or Z dodge".

I've always read this to be the case on various theorycrafting discussions about it but recently when I checked Aldriana's spreadsheet the removal of Sunder Armourx5 (2600 armour) reduced my dps on a boss with 7700 armour from 1917.67 to 1631.17 (14.95% loss in dps, 286.5 raw dps), whereas the removal of CoR reduced my dps from 1917.67 to 1818.01 (5.2% loss in dps, 99.66 raw dps).<br>
<br>
From the calculations here it seems like Armour Pen actually became worse for me dps-wise as I got more of it :S, have I done something obviously wrong or has the theorycrafting on armour pen changed since I last checked?

		<div id="post_message_627041">Re the Stamina/DPS tradeoff:<br>
<br>
My general philosophy on this is to always use an agi/stam gem (usually shifting(?) nightseye) in all blue sockets in my gear. Sure, I may lose a little bit of DPS by doing so, but most of the time doing so also allows me to meet a socket bonus that lessens the impact. Usually, this DPS loss is quite small, and what I get in return is 60 HP per blue socket. This seems like a reasonable tradeoff to me, and lets me run between 10k and 11k health while raid buffed.<br>
<br>
All in all, this seems like a better strategy to me than swapping in random PvP gear, since PvP gear uses itemization on resilience and crit. For very stamina-sensitive fights I do swap out my T4 legs for S3 legs with the stamina armor kit, and this gets me an extra 750 health or so. However, with my socketing strategy I find that I rarely am too low on stam for the fight.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">As far as Morogrim goes, yes if you open up with all your cooldowns right away you are going to have issues, read up on the mechanics of the fight some more to understand why your tank's threat is going to suck at first, same with Hydross for the reasons I mention, Hydross wait until you have 15 seconds before the switch to use your CD's.  <b>Also, as you tank gears up, Morogrim will start off even slower due to dodge/parry strings.</b>  Don't plan to use CD's on Morogrim until around 90% or so, to give your tank time to get a lead and to start generating consistent threat.</div>

</div>The bolded part of your statement there is something I didn't even consider. Our tank for the Morogrim fight has gained some extra gear lately, which would explain why I'm starting to have some troubles on threat. Usually when I start having problems with controlling a fight, I look only for factors about myself that have changed (gear, rotation, etc). I'm up to date on the mechanics of the fight, I just never considered how tanking improvements would affect me. Time for me to work on generating steady threat as opposed to jumping from zero to "sweet jebus where's the vanish key!"<br>

Now, if I could only stop our hunters from pulling aggro on Leo. :P</div>

</div>Ask a Nihilium rogue, and he/she will tell you because it looked cool. Nihilium may be (one of) the top guilds in the world, but that's not due to heavy theory crafting, but due to more than excelent team work.<br>
<br>
For the theorycrafting part of these enchants, keep in mind that the +2 damage only scales with the weapondamage modifiers, while the +4 stats scales with those, but also with various raidbuffs and other stat modifiers. Furthermore, the +2damage has no effect on your Ruptures, since it's a raw weapon damage increase (you can estimate it's AP equivalence, but it's still not AP) while +4 stats does improve your Ruptures.<br>
<br>
The end results aren't too far apart, but for min/maxing it's something to consider.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">P.S. What's up with your gems tho? <br>
I did some math and I think it came down to Brigand's/Nethershadow/Midnight/T6 and Vashj belt would be the best options for your purple needs. T6 shoulders and Nyn'ja Tabi's are better off with 10hit in them.</div>

</div>Im guessing they are socketing to keep meta bonus on sharhaz.  You dont really lose that much overall dps on all over fights to maintain a decent amount more for a fight that is god awful.  I personally don't do it only because shadowsong's are fairly rare for us on drops, so I leave those to the healers since I already socketed.  If we get an excess at a later point, sure, I'd do the same, but until then, meh.  <br>
<br>
<br>
As for nihilium rogues, while skill does play a factor into progression, when you're guild literally smashes their head against bosses for hours on end, even the most retarded/unskilled people can beat bosses.  If everyone put in the time that they did and gave it a really effort, most people would be a lot further than they are now.  That isn't to say they arent skilled people, they are, for the most part, excellent players, but don't count on them for expert advice.  They do what they want full well knowing that they need no other explanation than "I'm in Nihilium".</div>

		<div id="post_message_627397">The other thing to keep in mind regarding gemming is that some gems are grandfathered in to some extent.  For instance, at the time I got T6 shoulders, I was wearing Shadow-Walker's Cord (which was best in slot at the time), so Vashj belt wasn't even a consideration; Nyn'jah Tabi hadn't even been invented yet, so that wasn't an option either.  Thus, I put my 2nd blue gem in shoulders, as I never expected to have a second socket bonus that was better.  It's true that my totally resocketing I could gain 3 agi in place of 6 AP, but as my guild is rather stingy on these matters, it doesn't seem worth burning 4 epic gems to gain 1 EP.  The fact that it works out better for Shahraz as well is icing on the cake.<br>

</div>Regarding Nihilum: They succeed because they play a lot - which is fine.  I don't want to take their success away from them.  But they've repeatedly shown themselves to be somewhat lacking in the theorycraft department, so I wouldn't place too much weight on their gear selections.<br>
<br>
Regarding TT vs Berserker's Call: They tend to be pretty comparable when everything is said and done.  I think TT is usually ahead by just a hair, but realistically they're close enough I wouldn't worry about it too much.<br>
<br>
Regarding "Optimal Hit" - if you're referring to the gear spreadsheet, I'd read the first post of that thread and the discussion of what optimal hit actually means.  If you're referring to the DPS sheet, I can't help you.</div>

<br>
"It's not surprising that the three EU guilds who have progressed the furthest in Black Temple are also the guilds that spent the most time on the PTR. While it's "only taken them 2 weeks" to kill most of the content in BT, we've been watching them rep on the dungeon for 2 months now."<br>
<br>
I browsed through WWS for the top 200 guild dps kills for every boss in black temple, trying to find Nihilum.  I assumed that what's maybe one of the best geared guilds in the world would be there.  No such luck.  Either they're not interested in doing top level dps, they can't, or they don't post their kills on WWS.  It might be all three.  <br>
<br>
However, some of the people posting on this website ARE part of the teams that are highly ranked on WWS, and they use the spreadsheets found here, the same spreadsheets that frequently, and accurately, contradict Nihilum's gear/gem/enchant suggestions.  <br>

So I recommend using the spreadsheets.</div>

</div>I'm in pretty much the same situation, though I have 3 pieces of T5 (shoulders, legs and gloves) in addition to my T4 (using helm and shoulders) and when I get the Kael Vial (attunement run tonight) it's likely I'll not see T5 content again unless there's another attunement run so I'm unlikely to ever get the 4-piece bonus.<br>
<br>
However, according to the dps spreadsheet (I'm using 2_3_2_9 - haven't updated yet) the difference between using Netherblade and Deathmantle shoulders (the piece that I can trade to go from 2-piece T4 to 3-piece T5) is only 4dps.  Once you're at that stage of progression it seems that the value of the T4 2-piece bonus becomes so small that you may as well simply ignore it.  If you get an upgrade then take it and switch to 5s/5r.  The worst that can happen is that your dps will fall by a fraction of a percent (4/1335 = 0.3% for me), which is frankly unnoticable.  That difference can happen due to even 2 lucky extra SS crits (or unlucky non-crits) across a 10 minute fight.</div>

</div>I would imagine you wouldn't even need the added bonus of Stormstrike to make envenom do more damage than rupture in this new scenario.  The real question I guess would be what's better a 5/5 Vile Poisoned Envenom or 3/3 Serrated Blades Rupture w/ or w/out mangle.  Since there's a higher probability that you would have the mangle debuff in a raid as oppposed to stormstrike, you may want to include that.  At least that's the case in my guild.

</div>Most top end guilds always have an enhancement shaman in the raids, so it really depends if you have an elemental as well, because if so odds are they will get the charge before you.  But the more realistic comparison that we need to run is a 4/5 Vile Poison Envenom versus a 0/3 Serrated Blades Rupture with Mangle, since those of us concerned with our DPS are typically running 20/41/0, and Serrated Blades isn't exactly part of a Combat Swords build.</div>

</div>I can't see that happening anytime soon. <br>
<br>
Envenom (Rank 2) = [900 + (AP*.15)] * 1.2<br>
Rupture (Rank 7) = [1000 + (AP*.24)] * 1.3<br>
<br>
Just at a glance, Rupture scales much better with your AP even without Serrated Blades. Just for argument's sake, assume a rogue has 1800 AP: <br>
<br>
Envenom = [900 +  (1800*.15)] * 1.2 = 1170 * 1.2 = <b>1404</b><br>
Rupture = [1000 + (1800*.24)] * 1.3 = <b>1432</b> * 1.3 = 1861<br>
<br>
An untalented Rupture still beats a talented Envenom. And to top it off:<br>
<br>
Envenom - 1404 / 35 = 40.11 DPE<br>
Rupture - 1432 / 25 = 57.28 DPE untalented, 74.44 DPE talented<br>
<br>
Just for argument's sake, let's look at a typical 20/41/0 spec with 4/5 Vile Poisons (1.16 modifier) and no Serrated Blades (no 1.3 modifier). Again, assume 1800 AP: <br>
<br>
Envenom = [900 +  (1800*.15)] * 1.16 = 1170 * 1.16 = 1357 (38.77 DPE)<br>
Rupture = [1000 + (1800*.24)] = 1432 (57.28 DPE)<br>
<br>
The obvious counter-argument is that Envenom can crit (200% damage), Rupture cannot. Ignoring energy cost in this example for the time being, Envenom is doing 1357 / 1432 = .9476, or 94.76% of the damage of Rupture (and that gap would widen as AP increases). A base crit chance of only 6% would push the average damage of Envenom over that of Rupture (1357 * 1.06 = 1438.42), but the DPE is still lower (41.08). <br>
<br>
To get the same DPE out of Envenom, we would need to get 57.28 * 35 = 2004.8 damage from it on average, which is approximately a 47.7% crit rate: 1357 * 1.477 = 2004.289. <br>
<br>
I'm obviously not even in T5 content yet, so I can't really comment on how unrealistic it is to even try to get that high of a crit rate, but I'm thinking it probably can't happen easily. I haven't accounted for debuffs on the boss (Mangle, Misery, etc), but I can't imagine they'd provide anything close to the damage buff necessary to have Envenom catch Rupture.<br>
<br>
At the moment, this change (if real) seems to be geared more towards 41/20/0 Mutilate specs who can consistently do a 4-5s/4-5r/4-5env cycle. Basically, a good combo point dump that won't kill your DP stack. <br>
<br>
Note: Please correct my math if I've miscalculated something.</div>

</div>T6 quality in every slot with lotp, AToL up, BoK, is still only ~43% crit (unless you gem for agi or something) :P Pure Fist Spec envenom heroes?

</div>Considering the fact that with the best gear obtainable rogues would be looking at 2.1k+ ap unbuffed, add mangle, it's quite clear that unless there are any other changes rupture will still be the "butter" finisher for rogues.<br>
I can see Mutilate specs using it though. 45-50%+ crit rate is quite obtainable (Scroll, Food, Elixir, Feral, GoA Twisting)+ You wouldn't have problems with slack energy/cp's. <br>
I also wonder how 2 piece T5 would affect the damage. Too bad I sharded mine. =/</div>

		<div id="post_message_629044">So it's probable this post is a bit noobish to make here, but I figured I'd get more constructive and informed responses here than I would on general.<br>
<br>
I got my rogue to 70 a bit ago and then shelved it to gear my paladin instead.  The rogue is in pretty horrendous gear, slowly improving (I still have a Painweaver Band, how I haven't replaced it yet is beyond me, I couldn't tell you why).  He's currently mutilate specced with the SL dagger and the dagger from the SMV questline, but I would like to go combat swords before I jump into Kara.<br>
<br>
The problem is that I can't seem to obtain swords that I'd actually want to hop into Kara with.  Grinding out arena points for the s2 swords would take a bit longer than I'd like.  There's the decent slow sword from regular Mech, but it has the typical horrendous drop rate for 5 man weapons.  Should I suck it up and run Mech/BM until decent blue swords drop, or should I grind honor and pick up the S1 swords?  Any other suggestions would be helpful as well.<br>
<br>
Also, I'm currently running with the Helm of the Claw with a RED.  Is it worth levelling Engineering for the deathblow goggles?  Would I be replacing it any time soon?</div>

Or should I try to just keep the DPS spreadsheet open and work off that?<br>
<br>
2) Given the difference between combat swords and combat maces (~1% DPS), would you say the difference is negligible, or significant? 10-13 DPS for someone doing 1000-1300 DPS doesn't seem like an awful lot to me in the grand scheme of things.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Question for you:<br>
<br>
"For example, once you reach or surpass the hit cap, you will never miss an attack against a raid boss unless you are under the effect of some debuff that reduces your hit chance"<br>
<br>
If this is true could someone elaborate on why 2 hit capped rogues in SSC/TK would have a miss rate between 4.5-6.6%, would these be soley related to dodge and parried attacks?</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Hello all, I have been struggling lately on what rotation to use, according to the spreadsheet the suggest rotation would be 3s/5r, deciding to test that out, I went to the good old blasted lands and found myself a Servant of Allistarj to test the aforementioned rotation on. The outcomes left me puzzled, I have to admit I was sure to achieve some better results. <br>
Recount tells me I averaged 953.6 dps on a lvl 55 mob, thus having the upperhand in terms of weapon skill vs monster defense skill. I was using IP MH and DP in OH, using the rotation (starting with SS activating SnD, getting to 3cp refreshing the SnD then all the way up to 5cp and rupture) I found myself unable to keep it for a long, there were times in which I was  at 5 cp with my previous rupture still ticking and 9 seconds left, and times in which i had like 6 seconds left on SnD and only with 3 or 4 CPs. In order to keep the SnD always up and running I found myself relying a lot on combat potency procs (according to recount noone of my weapon swings missed) and ruthlessness ones. I had sporadically times in which with this rotation SnD was down, be them half second or 2-3 seconds long, before I had 3 cps in order to refresh it. <br>
Now the question that comes to mind, If I cant' keep up that rotation against a lvl 55 monster thus getting the most out of talents like Combat Potency, I assume that against a lvl 73 raid boss the things can only get worst. Should I use a 3 or 4 cp rupture being the difference in ticks minimal, or the loss of the free finisher will make the situation even worst?.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</div>I've been slowly reading this thread ever since DMM pointed it out to me.  I'm up to page 53 and decided I really had to ask a question.  How does a rogue that is doing 953 dps manage to test any rotation on a lvl 55 mob?  Isn't the mob typically dead after a few hits?  I'm not being facetious, this is for my own edification and I'm assuming others would like to know.  I'm trying to maximize my own rotation.  Knowing how to test strategies and techniques on lower level mobs would be a great boon to my learning curve.  In case you feel the urge to answer this query with try the spreadsheet, I have and I don't quite trust it implicitly yet.  It currently says 5s/5r, which I would buy.  Except for the fact that it says when Curator finally drops my T4 gloves my new cycle should be 1s/5r.  This is definitely something I would like to test out on my own rather then when I'm leading a raid somewhere.<br>
<br>
I've learned a lot reading this thread.  Some of them are relatively simple like if you're running with an enhancement shaman remember not to put poison on your MH. The spreadsheet has also been helpful.  Wish I would have discovered it before purchasing <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080212154857/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=33296"><span  ><span class="purplename">[Brooch of Deftness]</span></span></a>, but glad I found it before vendoring my <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080212154857/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=29381"><span  ><span class="purplename">[Choker of Vile Intent]</span></span></a>.  My guild is only just starting to work through Karazhan and I'm severely threat capped.  (My build is optimized more to aid in my own survival and get in a lot of vanishes/feints, run Heroic Instances and help out with the occasional arena match.)  On those rare opportunities I get invited along to participate in a raid where the tank can generate a lot more threat then my guildies, I would like to at least offer up whatever dps my spec/gear/abilties can provide.</div>

		<div id="post_message_630424">No, it's not confirmed yet, but the PTR is on the background downloader now i think.<br>
<br>
If it does turn out to work this way however, the DPS gain would probably be fairly minor.<br>
Before i write more, keep in mind this is scratchpad math and i don't play envenom myself, so likely to be very inaccurate. Please take it with a heavy grain of salt.<br>
<br>
<br>
The bonus here, is that in theory he'd be able to put instant poison on his MH now, or leave it open for windfury, which will cause a decent increase in DPS. However, as he's using slow daggers, it's highly possible that with only the offhand enchanted with DP the stack of 5 might fall off fairly frequently. So in the end even with the changes you'd still be using dual DP or even wound poison.<br>
<br>
How fast does a 41/20 rogue go from 0 to 5 stacks of DP with both weapons poisoned with DP ? <br>
Pretty fast undoubtedly, but let's assume 4 seconds for now. Though it might be faster or slower in reality.<br>
So, with an energy consumption / combo point generation of about 20/2 : 600 energy per minute.<br>
With a rotation of 2s/4e means you'd be using 25,60,60,35 per cycle (talents not included in this calculation) and thus be using about 3.3 cycles per minute.<br>
<br>
DP while active is about 90 DPS<br>
When not active, 0 DPS.<br>
<br>
With 2.4 it'd be at a constant 90 DPS once you get the stack to it's limit.<br>
Instead of falling back to 1 or zero stacks 3 times per minute.<br>
As median you'd be on ~50 poison DPS for 4 seconds per cycle. 4x3.3x40 = 533,32 damage lost each minute.<br>
533,32 / 60 = ~9 DPS<br>
<br>
I'm not so much worried about rupture -vs- envenom, it's been researched quite often.<br>
But, if the 2.4 change is real and gives only ~9 DPS for envenom spec extra, it seems fairly minor to me.<br>
<br>
Disclaimer : All math in this post was done quick and dirty for the sake of creating a rough estimate, and will likely differ from the actual values in game. If somebody has a bit more time, or mathematical knowledge to spend on calculating it please do so.<br>
<br>
Personally i think mutilate or envenom should "refresh" all poisons currently active on the target in order for it to be worth it, much like the paladin's Crusader strike.<br>
Edit: Forgot to include envenom energy use in the calculation... DPS gain turns out even lower this way.</div>

</div>It's likely that this has to do with the fact that you are currently wearing the wastewalker tunic. Adding the leggings would give you the Wastewalker 2pc set bonus, which is +35 hit rating. For your gear level, that's a huge upgrade. However, you'd likely get an even better upgrade by getting 2pc T4.<br>
<br>
Personally, I wouldn't waste the armor kit on wastewalkers since you should be replacing your chestpiece with the Kara one, ZA one, or the one from Mag within a relatively short amount of time.<br>
<br>
In general: most of the time when you find a "magical" blue that is worth a ton more than a purple, either (a) your gear is strangely allocated and needs improvement, or (b) there is a set bonus involved.</div>

	</table>
</div>Edgewalker and Shadowmaster's tend to run very close in terms of raw DPS; for me, Nyn'jah Tabi comes out ahead by .6 AP on sustained fights.  Now, the first thing to remember is that the spreadsheets are generally not accurate at this resolution, anyway;  I wouldn't feel comfortable saying more than that they're sidegrades of each other.  However, even if this were not the case, Shadowmaster's has two other advantages:<br>
<br>
1) Shadowmaster's has more stamina.  Even if you subscribe to the theory that stamina is not worth trading DPS for (which I disagree with, but, whatever): it seems pretty clear to me that if you have two items that do completely identical DPS, the one that has higher stamina is better.<br>
<br>
2) On interrupted fights Shadowmaster's holds a slight edge in terms of quality.  They do totally equivalent damage on sustained fights, and Shadowmaster's gains more of it's benefit through crit/AP, while Nyn'jah Tabi gets more of it's benefit from hit.  Since hit only works on white damage, while crit/AP works on everything, the advantage shifts towards Shadowmaster's on fights where you do more yellow damage than usual - that is, on interrupted fights.<br>
<br>
So from a totally abstract perspective, I would argue that Shadowmaster's are the best boot in the game.  Not by a whole lot, but if you had to only pick one boot to wear, they're the one I'd pick.<br>
<br>
Of course, implied by that last statement is the real answer, which is: by the time you're reasonably considering Shadowmaster's as an option, you should have long since picked up Nyn'jah Tabi; and since you have both anyway, the optimal thing to do is pretty clearly to socket your Nyn'jah Tabi towards hit (rigid rigid, probably) and enchant it +12 agi, and socket your Shadowmaster's boots more towards agi (glinting/glinting or even delicate/glinting) and enchant it with Cat's Swiftness.  You can then use Shadowmaster's for most fights (the ones where you're going to be moving around and thus want run speed, plus trash) but swap out for Nyn'jah Tabi to use on purely stationary nuke fights (such as Teron).</div>

		<div id="post_message_630927">One other question I have (and thank you very much, those who responded to my previous question about the Wastewalker Leggings), is that I have been playing around with the spreadsheets again, playing with various swords-based talent combinations.  I've seen numerous testimonies of the merits of 20/41/0 and 19/42/0, but I decided to see what would happen if I took one point out of Improved Kick (with no apparent effect on buffed raid DPS) from the 20/41/0 spec and put it in the assassination tree to cap out Vile Poisons, leading to the 21/40/0 spec which I have heard nothing of.<br>
<br>
My question is, if this spec improved my buffed raid DPS by about 3 (which some may consider negligible), why is it not prominent?  Does it have something to do with my gear, again?  Or is there some other beneficial, non-damaging effect that Improved Kick or Improved Sprint may bring to a raid that is considered more significant than 5/5 Vile Poisons?  The only things I can think of in this case would be poison-immune raid bosses or trash, or perhaps a scenario in which the rogue was rooted/slowed and Imp. Sprint might help to alleviate this problem in a way that CoS could not, in order to return to melee range.<br>
<br>
I'm sorry if this post is confusing, I couldn't think of a better way to word what I was asking.<br>
<br>
Thanks a lot to anyone who has any input!<br>
<br>
EDIT:  I now realize that this is impossible; the spreadsheet did not apply the restrictions placed by the various talent tier requirements.  I decided to keep this post here, however, for historical value (or just as an example of how you need to be careful with what you play around with before you say something).</div>

</div>Or save your DKP and leave Shadowmaster's for the people that didn't bother picking up Nin'jah's Tabi Boots.  At this point, having the latter, I'd only pick up Shadowmaster's if the alternative was a shard.  Other people need them more.</div>

		<div id="post_message_631071">Well, there's that, too.  I was speaking more from a "total optimal endpoint" scenario, without worrying too much about the timing of getting there.  Clearly you want to let your fellow rogues who didn't get Nyn'jah Tabi have them first (though one has to wonder *why* they didn't get NT boots, since any rogue reasonably working on Shahraz shouldn't have any difficulty obtaining 60 badges).  However, eventually, enough will drop that the other rogues will have them; and even if you decide to let feral druids and/or hunters get them too (which strikes me as significantly more debatable), *eventually*  enough will drop that you'll get one.  So, yes, if there are other people in the guild who are needier, it would certainly be polite to let them have it.  But when it gets to the point where people are taking it for off-spec or non-primary raiding roles, it seems reasonable to jump in and grab a pair, since they *are* best in slot, even if not by very much.<br>
<br>
So, for instance, in my guild: we have 4 rogues.  Despite having killed Shahraz for over 6 months now we've only seen 2 Shadowmaster's.  Of the remaining 2 rogues, I'm wearing Nyn'jah Tabi, and the other guy isn't.  Hence, I'm going to let him get the next one.  But that doesn't change the fact that they are optimal for me and eventually I'd like to have a set, regardless of whether it's the 4th, 5th, or 12th pair that drops.</div>

		<div id="post_message_631192">This is something I've been digging around trying to find some information on, but haven't had much luck (even in the Mutilate thread itself).<br>
<br>
Our guild is bringing up the rear (so to speak) in terms of progression and we're just now getting into SSC and possibly TK. That of course means the dreaded Hydross and Loot Reaver fights aren't far away. <br>
<br>
To provide a little necessary background, our guild is not min/max by any means. Our guild leader operates firmly on the basis of "play what you want, but play it well", and I'm no exception. I chose to raid with Mutilate, and I have no intention of changing that solely for 1 or 2 boss fights. That said, I still want to put my best effort forward with what I have. <br>
<br>
Maybe there's a good post I've missed, or some good info that some vets haven't shared, but <u>what are some things I can do to optimize my DPS for Hydross and Void Reaver as Mutilate spec</u>?<br>
<br>
Off the top of my head, Sharpening Stones would be a good start, and possibly stacking Armor Penetration (Executioner, Icon of Unyielding Courage, S3 pvp items). I've also read people suggesting to use short cycles and keep FW up as much as possible, as you're really just refreshing Slice and Dice over and over and burning extra points on Eviscerate. Though I can't say I've tried this or heard much raving support for it. <br>
<br>
I've also thought of swapping in more Hit Rating gear as my white damage would probably be more important than my ability to crit and keep multiple abilities running. <br>

Any thoughts or advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks guys!</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I must be missing something here - using both the T5 and T6 EP weightings listed on page 1, as well as both the DPS and the Gear Spreadhseets in full T6 gear, using a 20/41/0 build, I'm seeing the Nyn'jah's tabi boots come out ahead of the Shadowmaster's Boots (even though it's by less than 2dps using the DPS sheet and 3dps using the Gear sheet) so how come everybody is talking about the Shadowmaster's Boots as best-in-slot?<br>
<br>
It seems that by any measure we currently have availabe, the Nyn'jah's Tabi Boots are in fact the best rogue boots currently in the game.</div>

</div>Read post 1411, basically 2 DPS is smaller then the realistic accuracy of the spreadsheet, and Shadow Master's have more Stamina.  Basically they aren't a straight up upgrade where one simply has more Hit or AP and nothing else changes.  The stats on the 2 boots are very different, and as post 1411 explains, that is different implications for different fights.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">This is something I've been digging around trying to find some information on, but haven't had much luck (even in the Mutilate thread itself).<br>
<br>
Our guild is bringing up the rear (so to speak) in terms of progression and we're just now getting into SSC and possibly TK. That of course means the dreaded Hydross and Loot Reaver fights aren't far away. <br>
<br>
To provide a little necessary background, our guild is not min/max by any means. Our guild leader operates firmly on the basis of "play what you want, but play it well", and I'm no exception. I chose to raid with Mutilate, and I have no intention of changing that solely for 1 or 2 boss fights. That said, I still want to put my best effort forward with what I have. <br>
<br>
Maybe there's a good post I've missed, or some good info that some vets haven't shared, but <u>what are some things I can do to optimize my DPS for Hydross and Void Reaver as Mutilate spec</u>?<br>
<br>
Off the top of my head, Sharpening Stones would be a good start, and possibly stacking Armor Penetration (Executioner, Icon of Unyielding Courage, S3 pvp items).

<br>
The general consensus was that against a non-poisoned mob, improved backstab's DPE will be close or slightly better than mutilate's DPE, depending on gearing. (Remember that backstab in a 41/20/0 build doesn't benefit from Opportunity, Aggression, or Surprise Attacks.) However, mutilate also grants an extra combo point and yields a lot more Find Weakness uptime, and therefore it's still better to use it even against a non-poisoned mob.<br>
<br>
As for ways to increase Mutilate damage against a non-poisonable, non-rupturable mob like VR... I really have no idea. Try running the AEP macro in the DPS spreadsheet for a mutilate spec when "poisonable" and "use rupture" are turned off, and see what you get. Then, find a gear set that maximizes those stats...</div>

If your raid has any mysterious cc-breaking problems, it's likely a Hunter's fault. Either it's a Multishot, or just not paying attention to what they're targeting, etc. I don't really know why, but many Hunters seem to have no ability to think rationally or even pay partial attention to what's going on.</div>

				2. Aldriana's 7 Commandments of Rogue DPS<br>
<br>
The first step to success as a raiding rogue is to adhere to the 7 commandments of rogue DPS. Following these guidelines is by far the most important step to improving your DPS, and if you do not follow them, then nothing in the rest of this post will help you.<br>
<br>
Don't die. <br>
Don't do anything that risks wiping the raid. <br>
Maximize your time on target. <br>
Don't let your energy cap out. <br>
Don't let SnD drop. <br>
Use one of the spreadsheets to figure out your best cycle; this will usually be the highest rupture uptime cycle that doesn't violate rule 4 or 5. <br>
Use your cooldowns.

		<div id="post_message_634098">You always want to get all the energy from every tick, proc, whatever, you have going.  If your energy ever hits 100, this is no longer true; for instance, if you're at 85 energy and you get a natural regen tick - well, that tick only gave you 15 energy instead of the usual 20, so you just wasted 5 energy, which is 100 damage (or so) you'll never get back.  Thus, it is important not to do this.  Similarly, you don't want to trim combat potency procs, Rod of the Sun King procs, or any other source of regen.  A good rule of thumb is that as soon as your energy gets over 65, you should be doing a move of some sort; as if you don't, you risk having a combat potency + regen tick happening back to back and wasting regen.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">If this Envenom change that is rumored occurs I am curious what this will due to Combat Mutilation builds in the PvE DPS hierarchy.  I don't think it changes cycles for Combat Mutilation much since <b>Envenom</b> already is <b>superior</b> to Eviscerate.  But can the Envenom change boost Combat Mutilation within the range of the Combat weapon builds?  Anyone seen any modeling on this?</div>

</div>Why do you think that? Almost all the math I've seen points that eviscerate is superior, especially towards the higher end as you gain ArP.</div>

		<div id="post_message_635840">We're working on getting Illidan down, so I'm starting to review my gear set (Again) to figure out the perfect set up before sunwell... and two questions are bother me, tried to solve it with a spreadsheet but the results are mixed.<br>
<br>
Firstly - At what point does it become worth it to replace a mongoose with executioner, which which hand?   I'd previously been under the impression there wasn't a point (at least not a obtainable point) and the current spreadsheet still shows it as a 5-10 dps drop for me (OH vs MH). Sitting at 399 ArPen + WSC right now.<br>
<br>
Second - WSC vs Lethality for my second trinket.  I have DST as my primary and was under the impression WSC was better then Lethality (For Combat Swords).  Old version of the spreadsheet had it that way (With Madness like a 0.3 DPS upgrade over the coil).  New version (2.4.0.2) has Madness ~4 dps over WSC, and Lethality ~10 dps over WSC despite the same talent spec and gear.  Thoughts on which actually ends up being better?</div>

		<!-- message -->
		<div id="post_message_635852">So, Lethality was redone in a recent patch of the DPS sheet, which explains the changes in your numbers.  I think there's still some debate as to how accurate the current model is.  For a second opinion, I might try the Rogue Gear Sheet, which has a pretty fair model of it.<br>
<br>
For me, it tends to be the case that Ashtongue Talisman scores higher on 7700 armor boss, and WSC higher on 6200 bosses, so I use them both to some extent.  However, I've also found that the Ashtongue Talisman is hard to get the full benefit out of on highly interrupted fights, so I also use WSC on, like, Supremus.  So on the whole: it varies some from fight to fight and depends on how much ArPen you have, whether your guild uses CoR, etc... but personally, I find that I use WSC more often than Ashtongue.<br>
<br>
Re: Mongoose vs Executioner.  If you're going to use it at all, you should use it on MH.  I find the merits of it are similar to WSC above; on 6200 armor bosses, it's better, and on 7700 armor bosses, it's a bit behind.  Since there are quite a few 6200 armor bosses, and the difference on 7700 bosses is relatively small, I prefer Executioner (with about 500 ArPen on Gear... but then, my guild is a devout user of CoR).  Which is better for you again depends on the use of CoR as much as your exact gear.</div>

Yes it's true.. Basicly all you need to do is enable target of target (so you can see who teron targets) and watch his castbar (use a addon like Quartz or something). If he targets you, he will start casting .. hit that vanish fast. That's it.. nothing else to it.<br>

<br>
I am new to this forum and I've been reading through a lot of the information that was posted by many experienced rogue around the community.  First, I'd like to thank to these fellow rogues for sharing their experience and informations.<br>
<br>
After reading all the information regarding the combo points.  I have been following the combat cycle on how to max out the sustained DPS during raid.  I seem to encounter a problem about energy regeneration.<br>
<br>
I notice with 2x T4, I should be doing 1cp SnD - 5cp Rupture.  Unfortunately, I seems to have to spam my SS on a boss  to get my cp as soon as I can without the use of Adrenaline Rush.  Procs on Combat Potency doesn't seems to be filling in the energy I need to quickly apply 5 cp and throw the rupture on the boss.  It seems I keep getting out damaged by the rogues that are wearing s1 + 1-2pc of Season 2 arena gear rogues that stacks up a lot of crits. <br>
<br>
If I use my Blade Flurry + Abbacus + Battle of War, it will probably come close enough to have 5cp rupture and hoping Ruthlessness would proc a extra cp for me to apply another 1 cp of SnD.  Can any experience rogue explain to direct me on what I am doing wrong?  I would really appreciate any tips and information.  I am still learning and hoping to be better at my class so please do not flame me if I made a mistake. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080212141522im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":)" class="inlineimg"><br>

</div>You should consider speccing combat sword before complaining that 1s/5r doesnt work out for you or someone is out-damaging you in a PvE situation with your PvP spec.

That's because the lack of Combat Potency means you don't have enough energy to sustain the tighter 1s/5r cycle.  If you couldn't sustain 1s/5r even as combat swords, then something's wrong - most likely a lack of +hit meaning you don't hit with your OH enough to get the CP procs necessary to sustain the cycle.<br>
<br>
Also, make doubly sure you're always attacking from behind.  Attacking from the front means you get parried, which <br>

I apologize for the mis-understanding regarding to my previous post.  I did state that I was specced "combat sword" 2 weeks ago and that now I am specced shadowstep due to the reason that I will be focusing in finishing up my arenas.  I do understand how combat sword spec regarding to the procs on Ruthlessness and Combat Potency.  Please simply ignore my "Current spec" and replace it with Combat sword spec as it was 2 weeks ago.  I just don't want to confuse anyone, if they decide to click on my armory and find out I have a different spec than I have listed.<br>
<br>
Yes, I did use Rogue's Gear Spreadsheet created by Aldriana and as well the Rogue DPS Spreadsheet.<br>
The result was 730+ DPS with no raid buff.  Raid buffed comes close to 1600+ DPS.  I was also following the "optimal hit" that was stated using rogue's gear spreadsheet, also following the recommended gem listing that the spreadsheet recommend.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">You don't get CP procs if you aren't specced for CP!  With a shadowstep spec (or even tri-spec Hemo), you should be using something between 3s/5r and 5s/5r.  That's because the lack of Combat Potency means you don't have enough energy to sustain the tighter 1s/5r cycle.  If you couldn't sustain 1s/5r even as combat swords, then something's wrong - most likely a lack of +hit meaning you don't hit with your OH enough to get the CP procs necessary to sustain the cycle.<br>
<br>
Also, make doubly sure you're always attacking from behind.  Attacking from the front means you get parried, which <br>
(a) gets the tank killed<br>
(b) lowers your DPS<br>
(c) loses you a chunk of your CP procs, lowering DPS even more</div>

I have always been fighting behind the target, and understanding the effects of less parry, dodge, and more crit.  I control my aggro fairly well with the use of threat meter, and feint.  I have thought it could be the amount of feint, but it couldn't be possible to really affect my DPS that much over a 10 minutes fight when I use them for approx 5-6 times.  I do use vanish to wipe my threat after a while, which I insantly reopens with garrote and continue with 1s 5r rotation as a "combat sword" rogue.<br>

It seems that you are a bit low in hit if you can't get enough energy back from CP.<br>
Try regem for hit and hope for the WSC from VR.<br>
Unless you have problems with Meta Gem activation restrictions go for max hit gems on the legs.</div>

		<div id="post_message_636703">If you're inputting your gear and spec into the sheet, and you're following its recommendations, your problem is likely due to the encounter or the RNG game.<br>
<br>
1. If you're doing encounters which require movement, you're frequently out of melee range and thus not getting CP procs, which ruins your cycle.<br>
2. The cycle recommendation may be very tight for your specific gearset. It will average energy gains for you to determine your cycle, but if for whatever reason you are starved from CP procs for a bit, you won't be able to maintain a cycle.<br>
<br>
To resolve these issues, you can expand to a slightly longer cycle that will drop SnD less in exchange for less rupture uptime, resuting in an increase to your DPS. Try a 2s/5r cycle for a bit and see how it feels.<br>
<br>
The other thing you can do is if you find yourself at 4 CPs with a few seconds left on SnD and not enough energy to get that 5th CP, just do a 4 CP rupture so you can refresh SnD before it drops; that is more important.</div>

Tidewalker, if you never get Graved, is the type of fight modeled by the spreadsheets.<br>

</div>5agi/5hit vs 10hit is sort of a matter of personal preference; thus, while I agree that replacing 5crit/7sta with 5agi/7sta, the overall trend of socketing everything with 10 hit is not necessarily something you need to follow.  In particular, I wouldn't waste my time with regemming Cursed Vision, Slayer's Gloves, or Slayer's Legs.  Fundamentally, the only places where your socketing is notably questionable is the chest (which isn't best in slot even pre-2.4, so I wouldn't change it - I'd just make sure to gem Slayer's with a Shifting and 2 Glinting/Rigids when you get it), and shoulders/boots where you should indeed use shifting for the blue slots.<br>
<br>
It also should be kept in mind that the grand total damage increase from making those gem changes will be less than 10 DPS.  Probably more like 5.  So I doubt I'd even bother regemming anything, as I suspect your guild - if it's anything like my guild - isn't too fond of the idea of burning epic gems for a 1 DPS increase each.  It's more something to keep in mind going forward.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I know this isn't probably the right place to ask but I don't know where else to get reliable information from. After two months of break I am thinking of raiding again and before I go back to Black Temple I would like to clarify something. I have been reading a lot of stuff about rogues vanishing out of Teron Gorefiend's shadow of death debuff while the spell is being casted. This apparently doesn't place the debuff on you or anyone else for one cycle. Is this true and if it is, is their any certain way to do it? I read this post where someone said if you vanish too early he places the debuff on someone else.<br>
<br>
If anyone could provide any further information about this it will be appreciated.</div>

</div>Again not that it belongs here but...<br>
<br>
This is a bad idea regardless of wether or not its true.  Once a person gets thier mobs down they use thier ghost with the leftover time to go assist the next person.  From the first ghost on it gets progressively easier.  <br>
<br>
If you break that chain you gain rdps on the boss but at the cost of additional chance on the mini-game of having a person fail utterly and wipe the raid due to constructs getting loose.  <br>
<br>
Aside: We use the cloak and neck for SR for teron, if you're trying to burn him down faster because people/tank are dropping due to oom healers id recommend adding SR before trying to vanish out of the debuff.</div>

</div>It's mostly based on WWS parses. From WWS, observed dodge rates for bosses are in the 6.3-6.6% range, with parry being approximately double that (12.6-13.2%). Take a look at parses from the tank's perspective, as that gives the most accurate figures. (Also, remember to add in any percentage reduction that the tank's expertise is taking off.)<br>

It's empirical, and basically appears to be a good bit about the 5.6% figure you would expect.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">According to many spreadsheets, I am supposed to do above 1.9k dps. However, I never seen that number so far. The maximum dps I had was on 3rd boss of Hyjal and it was 1.8k. I usually do around 1.6k. <br>
<br>
Ah also I try to use 3snd 5 rupture rotation ( I dont know thats a good rotation for maximizing uptime of Ashtongue)<br>
<br>
This was really unsatisfying and since sunwell is approaching I want to improvise with your suggestions.</div>

</div>Also, you have to look at the rest of your raid's overall dps.  If your guild kills gorefiend in 4.5 minutes your personal dps will be lower than if your guild kills gorefiend in 3 minutes, for example.  That is partly because of our Adrenaline Rush cooldown.  The faster your kills the higher your DPS will be as a general matter until you reach the 5 minute mark and then it sort of resets itself.  Missing DST is obviously huge and when you get your MH warglaive your DPS will skyrocket.  The 4 piece bonus is nice as well.  Sounds like you are doing most things properly.  As your raid gears up, your DPS will go up.  Also, I prefer a 4 or 5 snd 5 rupture rotation when I am using ashtongue.  I think in one of these threads aldriana showed that this was preferable.</div>

		<div id="post_message_639907">Note that the .1 in Shaker's equation comes from the scaling of miss chance against higher-level mobs; while it's been well-established for *players* that the conversion is .04, it has been shown fairly conclusively that bosses have different scaling than players.<br>

Now, the thing that's always bothered me about that particular formula is the fact that hit has the significant discontinuity when the defense difference surpasses 10, and as dodge does not it doesn't strike me as necessarily the case that the same scaling should apply.  But as it has better agreement with observed data, it's the number we've been going with until someone finds a better one.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">5) While we're on the topic of stat weightings: am I correct in assuming that you made these stat estimates with very few AP buffs?  Since, for instance, with the default gear in the 0.9.3 Gear Sheet (which is mid-to-high end T6), I get very different stat weightings:<br>
<br>
Str: 1.1<br>
Agi 2.3<br>
Crit: 1.9<br>
Hit: 2.64<br>
Expertise: 2.9<br>
Armor Pen: .33<br>
Haste 2.26<br>
Metagem: 102<br>
<br>
Which is really pretty different than what you have posted.  I suspect the answer is one of buffs, but I don't think the default buffs in the Gear sheet are *that* unreasonable for  T6 guild, so... if you're posting extremely low-buff numbers, it might be worth making note of that fact; and I for one would recommend posting higher-buff numbers, since, lets be honest, how many rogues raid without Blessing of Might and Battle Shout, even if they don't have much else?</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</div>I went back and evaluated a set of best-of-T6 gear using your spreadsheet, including a very standard assortment of buffs to be expected in a 25-man raid, except with BoK turned off (since I feel its effect is easy to multiply in afterwards, though I may be mistaken). The only difference between the set I evaluated in your sheet and the set I used on mine for the current version of the first post is that I included <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080306063038/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=28830"><span  ><span class="purplename">[Dragonspine Trophy]</span></span></a> when using your sheet. Here are the resulting stat weights:<br>
<br>
Str: 1.00<br>
Agi: 1.98<br>
Hit: 2.37<br>
Crit: 1.70<br>
Exp: 2.60<br>
Haste: 2.16<br>
ArP: 0.33<br>
Meta: 99.67<br>
<br>
These agree more with my stat weights and less with yours, and I was very much at a loss as to how I obtained such different results until I realized that you used the default buffs. The default buffs in your sheet assume no Unleashed Rage. Unleashed Rage would increase the DPS contribution of Strength, Agility, and Attack Power by about 10% each, thereby decreasing the EP weights of the other stats. Your default buffs also assume Blessing of Kings, which would increase Strength and Agility by another 10% each. Here's what I got by checking the exact same gear and buff setup, except with UR turned off and BoK turned on:<br>
<br>
Str: 1.10<br>
Agi: 2.22<br>
Hit: 2.47<br>
Crit: 1.77<br>
Exp: 2.71<br>
Haste: 2.28<br>
ArP: 0.35<br>
Meta: 109.02<br>
<br>
This seems to agree slightly more with your values. Still, it's obvious that certain buffs make pretty big differences in the EP weights. Given that, what do readers feel is the best approach for this issue? Is it prudent to assume that a rogue in raids always or never gets an enhancement shaman? Prudent to assume that a rogue does or does not receive BoK? What other buffs are prudent to assume? Here's the set I used for the current version of the first post:<br>
<br>
Power Word: Fortitude (2/2 talented)<br>
Mark of the Wild (5/5 talented)<br>
Battle Shout (5/5 talented, no <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080306063038/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=30446"><span  ><span class="purplename">[Solarian's Sapphire]</span></span></a>)<br>
Blessing of Might (0/5 talented)<br>
Unleashed Rage<br>
Leader of the Pack<br>
Hunter's Mark (5/5 talented)<br>
Flask of Relentless Assault<br>
Spicy Hot Talbuk<br>
Strength of Earth Totem (2/2 talented)<br>
Curse of Recklessness<br>
Sunder Armor<br>
Faerie Fire<br>
Mangle<br>
Bloodlust (x1)<br>
Windfury Totem (2/2 talented)<br>

		<div id="post_message_640702">It seems to me the right approach is to pick a sort of intermediate set of buffs and work from there.  For instance, in my current guild, we always have 3 - and sometimes as many as 5 - paladins in all raids, so kings is 100%.  But until about 2 months ago, we didn't have an enhancement shaman at all - hence no Unleashed Rage.  But I'm sure there are other guilds that always raid with an enhancement shaman, but rarely get more than 2 pallies so no kings.  So I think the only reasonable option is to try it with a couple different buff sets and then pick something sort of intermediate amongst the range of values.  But really, this just reiterates how important it is to use a spreadsheet if you want accurate information.</div>

</div>Relentless Strikes isn't a one in 5 chance - its a 1 in 5 chance PER combo point.  On a 5-point finisher, its gaurenteed.  A standard Combat swords build will generate roughly ~30-40% of its energy from Relentless Strikes (well, 30-40% of the non-tick based regen).  Ruthlessness does NOT gain the equivalence of 35-60 energy (who the hell would use an untalented SS.. ever?).  You gain a combo point.  If you gained the energy, you would also be getting the dmg of the Hemo/SS/BS which is obviously not the case.  Ruthlessness basically just allows for shorter cycles, resulting in higher finisher uptime.<br>
<br>
Going Tri-Spec hemo isn't a bad idea for a Kara-progression guild.  Generally you + a tank will eat up all the charges anyways, but having more melee just makes for an even lower chance of losing some of the debuff benefit.  That said, using a more standard Tri-spec Hemo will net you a dps gain.</div>

		<div id="post_message_642053">Well, for an assessment of how the spec performs, I'd plug it into one of the spreadsheets.  I'd then plug in the cookiecutter 11/28/22 TSH build - or perhaps the 11/21/29 variant, as you're mixing weapons, and see how your DPS compares.  I'd be willing to bet you'll find that one of the traditional TSH builds does more damage.<br>
<br>
The problem with the spec the way you've entered it is that fundamentally you just don't have the points to take two weapon specializations in a tri-spec build.  It's not that they aren't good talents - there's just other things that are better.  And in particular: Relentless Strikes is better.<br>
<br>
Now, I know you say you don't buy into the value of RS, and you're certainly entitled to your own opinion.  You are, of course, wrong, but you're still entitled to it.  Allow me to explain the error in your logic:<br>
<br>
Relentless Strikes has a 20% chance <b>per combo point</b> of returning 25 energy.  Thus, every combo point you generate effectively returns 5 energy.  Thus, having Relentless Strikes is like lowering the cost of Hemo from 35 to 30.  Not having it is totally equivalent to running combat swords without Imp Sinister Strike - you can do it, but I don't think anyone's going to reasonably argue that it's a good idea.<br>
<br>
Ruthlessness, on the other hand, just adds combo points - not energy as you assert, combo points.  The thing to remember is that SS, Hemo, and BS do more than give combo points - they do damage in their own right - a lot of damage.  As I recall, something like 80% of the damage contribution of these moves is due to the direct damage they do, with the rest being damage gained from the combo point.  Is gaining the combo point good?  Sure.  It lets you tighten up your cycle and get something of a damage increase.  But the advantage from doing so is vastly dwarfed by the damage gained by having more energy to do more Sinister Strikes.<br>
<br>
And, for that matter: Relentless Strikes adds more combo points anyway.  If you are, say, running Hemo with a 5s5r cycle, you're regenerating 50 energy - 1.4 Hemos - every cycle from Relentless Strikes.  3/3 Ruthlessness only gives 1.2.  So not only are you getting energy - and thus real damage - back, you're *also* generating more combo points.<br>
<br>
Past that: the real comparison is not RS vs Ruthlessness, as you're never making that tradeoff.  Lets, for instance, consider the energy regen from RS vs, say, Adrenaline Rush (which is in your build).  AR gives 150 energy once every 5 minutes.  In those 5 minutes, you regenerate 3000 energy the normal way, which is sufficient energy for 75 hemos and 15 5-point finishers.  Thus RS, in this time, generates 375 energy - 2.5 times as much as AR.  So if the choice is to trade off AR for RS - RS is unquestionably better.<br>
<br>
Fundamentally: when people say 11 points assa is essential for any good build, they know what they're talking about.  It really is that good.<br>
<br>
So, that's the major problem with the build you outlined, and the reason why 11/28/22 and 11/21/29 are the accepted Hemo builds.</div>

</div>Your misconception about Ruthlessness is that it is rewarding you with energy in the same way that Relentless Strikes does. This couldn't be further from the truth. Rather, Ruthlessness allows you to spend more energy per time on finishers than on regular attacks. More finishers is a good thing, but it comes at the cost of SS/BS/Hemo usage per time.<br>

However, with Relentless Strikes (which works very well in concert with Ruthlessness), you can use Slice and Dice and Ruptures with a proper cycle to spend nearly all of your energy per time on SS/BS/Hemo instead of finishers. This greatly increases your overall DPS (since you're getting the same finishers off and <i>still</i> spending more energy per time towards SS/BS/Hemo) while also lessening the negative portion of Ruthlessness' effect, improving that talent simultaneously.</div>

		<div id="post_message_642114">thank you for the feedback and pointing out my blatant oversight on RS (srry for my nubness im too used to pvp where the combo points dont matter as much as bursting the enemy down as soon as humanly possible)<br>
<br>
im personally tired of pvp welfare epics seeing that i own a few of them<br>
<br>
i guess the reason behind me not using the 11 points is due to pvp (i was lolstep for leveling and pvp)<br>

<br>
this is a changed spec with RS (thank you guys for your wisdom lol) but still sword fist hemo (in an acceptable range in my opinion)<br>
<br>
atm i am <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080228015125/http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=fheboxZhfVbrVzVMhot" target="_blank">Talent Calculator - World of Warcraft</a><br>
<br>
its not the normal spec but ive gotten #1 in the groups damage meter raid wide (we all keep personal meters for absolute calculation) since were in kara i figured the improved evis would help me out alot <br>
<br>
i personally dislike cookiecutter builds which is why i make these weird specs<br>
<br>
and into regaurds to the energy bit with ruthlessness- its just energy saved... i prolly should have worded it better</div>

</div>Cookie cutter builds exist because they are the BEST.  People figure out what is most effective, <u>and that becomes the cookie cutter spec</u>.  If you're trying to test other variations to find a NEW cookie cutter build, fine.  But just not using a cookie cutter build because you "personally dislike them" is like saying you don't like being the best you can be.<br>
<br>
Vary from a cookie cutter build if and ONLY if you think it's an improvement in some way.  If you have found some hidden gem that we haven't, we'd love to hear it.  And if it's better than what we already have, we'll gladly switch to the new build.  Which makes it a cookie cutter build.  See the issue with your thinking?</div>

</div>It's different, I won't match 11/28/22, 11/27/23 or 11/21/29, but it's not horribly far behind. But don't underestimate Weapon Expertise, on a per-point basis, WE is better than Sword Spec, and definitely better then Fist Spec. So if you really want both into your fist+sword hemo tri-spec, I'd put only 3 points into each and 2 into WE. (or 5 into sword spec and 1 into fists, but that would be sidetracking the build even further, even if it improves DPS.)<br>
<br>
Anyway, I don't want to get into a fight over viability again, so let's keep it at this: if you're happy with it, and your guild is okay with it, then go and enjoy. It's not perfect, that's why there are such things as cookie cutter builds, but it's not horrible either.</div>

				5. Gear Selection - Please consider this section of dubious merit until this disclaimer is removed.<br>
<br>
In this section, rather than listing comparisons between every piece of gear a rogue could conceivably obtain, I will describe a general-purpose system for comparing pieces of gear against one another. To compare two pieces, you can give each stat a "weight" proportional to its DPS contribution relative to other stats. Let's call this weight Equivalence Points (EP). We'll define 1 AP = 1 EP; that is, 1 attack power is worth exactly 1 Equivalence Point. Now we can use a spreadsheet to determine how much DPS a single point of any stat provides relative to a single point of attack power, and convert those directly into EP values.<br>
<br>
To utilize the EP weights, simply take a piece of gear and multiply each stat bonus on that piece by the EP weight for that stat. In case of gem sockets, figure out how you would gem the piece in actual use (instructions for gemming are given in the following section), and multiply the stats provided by each gem by their respective EP weights. Any stat provided that does not have direct DPS value (e.g. stamina, dodge rating, resilience) can be valued at 0 EP. Examples of using the EP weights are provided below.<br>
<br>
Tier 4: the following is a table of EP values for sword (16/41+4), dagger (15/41/5), Hemo+sword (11/28/22), and Hemo+Deadliness (11/21/29) builds, assuming a projected tier 4 level of gear and buffs (10-man raid).<br>

				<b>On stat weight scaling:</b> each stat's EP value will tend to scale with your gear, talents, and raid buffs. Sinister Calling will increase the EP value of agility by about 15%, while Blessing of Kings will increase the EP values of agility and strength by 10%. Deadliness will increase the DPS contribution of strength, agility, and attack power, which will have the effect of reducing the EP values of any other stats.

</div>I've never modelled it - so YMMV - but here's my reasoning.<br>
<br>
If the tank has enough initial threat - I'll run in and wail away with SS.<br>
If I think aggro will be a bit sketch that a sinister strike crit, then sword spec proc crit might make the boss "angry" with me, then I'll use stealth and garotte them.<br>
<br>
In nearly all circumstances - running in and hitting the boss will provide much more DPS than using Garotte.<br>
<br>
So - better is a bit subjective - but for me better is "not dead".</div>

</div>It really depends on your level of progression.  Leatherworking is going to be ideal for most rogues due to Drums, and the benefits your entire group gets from them.  You can also get some nice pieces of gear like the Boots from SSC/TK, Shoulders from BT/Hyjal, that are very nice until you can get better, however Edgewalkers are better, and the shoulders off High Warlord are close and T6 is better.  Armory isn't working so I am going by Wowjutsu, which says end of SSC/TK, but not in T6 yet.  In T7 it looks like LW and JC'ing will be the best with a Best in Slot LW'ing Chest, and a Best in Slot JC'ing Neck, until then, LW'ing and whatever else will be pretty close.</div>

</div>Sorry, but as the EP weights are based upon the theoretical DPS provided by each stat as calculated by our spreadsheet models of each spec, and considering that the best known Mutilate DPS model is not considered to be anywhere near as strong as those for other specs (read as: Seal Fate sucks and spreadsheet-makers hate it), I can't provide accurate EP values for a Mutilate build.<br>
<br>
I would venture that Mutilate builds would experience increased benefits from agility and crit relative to combat builds, slightly reduced benefit from hit and haste, and similar benefit from expertise. I couldn't guess whether armor penetration would be more or less valuable.</div>

</div>I wholeheartedly agree with you, but you and I both know that there will be a lot of people reading this thread who aren't likely to ever use the spreadsheet.<br>
<br>
I think the best way to approach the EP weights is probably to balance an "ideal" raid setup with a "realistic" raid setup. By this I mean that a typical raid is most likely not going to provide the rogue with an enhancement shaman, a BM hunter with a wolf, a DPS warrior, and a feral druid all in the same group. However, enhance+warrior+feral+rogue+rogue is a realistic setup that a typical raid guild would want to shoot for anyway. Full armor debuffs are ideal (FF+Sunder+CoR) and are reasonable to use on pretty much any boss (doing Archimonde attempts with CoR taught me that). I think that two paladins is probably the best assumption to make as well. Basically I assume anything that's reasonable to expect in a raid guild, without assuming any of the "fancy" stuff that can be done to increase DPS (Expose Weakness and Blood Frenzy, drums, haste pots). So the list comes out like this:<br>
<br>
Leader of the Pack<br>
Mark of the Wild (5/5 Improved)<br>
Faerie Fire<br>
Mangle<br>
Hunter's Mark (5/5 Improved)<br>
Blessing of Might (0/5 Improved)<br>
Power Word: Fortitude (2/2 Improved)<br>
Bloodlust (x1)<br>
Strength of Earth Totem (2/2 Improved)<br>
Windfury Totem (2/2 Improved)<br>
Unleashed Rage<br>
Curse of Recklessness<br>
Sunder Armor<br>
Battle Shout (5/5 Improved, no <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080228015125/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=30446"><span  ><span class="purplename">[Solarian's Sapphire]</span></span></a>)<br>
Flak of Relentless Assault<br>

				<b>On poisons and Windfury:</b> for PvE, always choose DP on the offhand. <b>If you are in a group with a shaman and you're combat, you'll get more DPS from Windfury as opposed to Grace of Air + IP.</b> However, the difference is not as dramatic as it is for, say, a DPS warrior. If your group contains a DPS warrior, Windfury Totem will usually be dropped. Otherwise, if less than half the group is rogues, Grace of Air Totem will probably be dropped and you should use IP on the MH. Always check with your shaman if you're unsure what will be dropped. For Mutilate, Grace of Air Totem might be preferable, but Windfury Totem is still quite powerful. Note that dual DP is a waste for all builds except Mutilate, and only if you use Envenom.

<br>
1. why doing a 4s5r cycle if you have no T4 set bonus? to get 5 points for the rupture, you need 20s to build them up. To cover these 20 seconds, a 3 point SnD is enough if you have put talents in it (which is the case with the combat builds)<br>

A 3 point slice and dice lasts for 18 * 1.3 = 23,4s<br>

Even a 2 point slice and dice will be good imo (lasts for 19.5 s, which leave you with 0.5 s of not having SnD, but I think this will be covered by the fact that  you have more finishers in the end)<br>
<br>
<br>
2. on the 1s5r cycle : a 1s finisher lasts for 18.6s when you got the T4 bonus. This means that you got 1.4 s of not having SnD. Does this mean that an extra point in SnD does not make up for the loss in rupture finishers??</div>

</div>You are forgetting that <i>after</i> the Rupture, you have to again build up points to use your next Slice and Dice. Letting Slice and Dice drop would be violating one of the 7 commandments of rogue DPS. If you don't have T4 2pc, 2s/5r will allow Slice to fall off before you can refresh it. 3s/5r is doable and is used by quite a large number of rogues, but 4s/5r is more reliable if you are worried about Slice falling off in the absence of procs.<br>
<br>
You are also forgetting that Combat Potency procs shorten the amount of time needed to generate the CP for your next finisher. On average, 1s/5r is the best usable cycle with T4 2pc, and 3s/5r or 4s/5r are best without it (until late T6, at which point you may choose to use 5s/5r).</div>

</div>I am sure someone else will address this as well, but it comes down to the value of finishers, Ruthlessness and Relentless Strikes.  Doing a 5 point finisher means your finisher is free because you will always get 25 energy, and you have a 60% chance to get a combo point, this means you get in more Sinister Strikes, which is generally going to be more DPS.  Also in your example what you have to factor in is what happens if one of your SS's is dodged, then you lose S&amp;D uptime.  A 4 point finisher still gives you an 80% chance to get 25 energy, so an average of 20 energy (15 for 3, 10 for 2, 5 for 1).<br>
<br>
Letting S&amp;D drop isn't a good option, and having planned downtime is even worse.  You have to remember that Rupture is only a small % of your DPS, and the spreadsheets are designed to model the relative value of increased Rupture uptime versus additional Sinister Strikes etc.<br>

</div>Not really, because you forget to factor it 25 energy from Relentless Strikes, an 80% chance you will get atleast 1 additional Combo Point from Ruthlessness, and the fact that you will hit approximately 1 time per second with your off hand, so in 18 seconds you will regen 45-60 energy (on average) from Combat Potency.  1s/5r is only viable with Combat Specs for this reason.</div>

In fact I've just downloaded the version using the full T6 gear and GoA/IP comes out on top for that also, so I'd appreciate it if you don't assume that I'm basing this on nothing, thank you very much.<br>

		<div id="post_message_645833">The DPS sheet does indeed say what he says it does, and as he mentioned later, the gear sheet disagrees.<br>
<br>
For my gear/spec/typical buffs, changing WF to IP7 and turning on GoA(improved) nets me a whopping 0.29 DPS increase in the buffed DPS column (and +14.45 DPS if I change it to Flametongue, YAY).<br>
<br>
However, using the same gear/buffs and making the same change of Wf(improved) -&gt; IP7 and adding imp. GoA nets me a 47 DPS loss on the gear sheet.<br>
<br>
I can't say who is wrong, but after raiding on a rogue for almost 3 years, I'm tempted to side with my experience, which says that WF is noticeably better than GoA + IP.<br>
<br>
One thing I did notice, is that toggling WF on and off in the DPS sheet only changed the field "other DPS".  I'd think that both "melee DPS" and "finisher DPS (i.e. SnD)" would go up when you add WF.  Actually, if WF on the DPS sheet was increased by 35% (2pc T6 SnD), it would almost match the gear sheet.  I wonder if that's the problem.</div>

<br>
1) The Gear sheet assumes that WF attacks can proc stuff - Mongoose/Executioner, Dragonspine Trophy, and the like.  Since you are now getting 20% more MH attacks, the proc rate on these goes up and increases your damage slightly.<br>
<br>
And, the larger effect:<br>
<br>
2) The Gear sheet treats WF as a buff with a duration, and thus increases the AP of a suitable proportion of your other attacks to encompass this fact.<br>
<br>
Now, I haven't actually tested either of these lately, so that might be worth doing; but my impression is that this is how it works.  Regardless: between these the value of WF is increased by about 30 DPS in the Gear sheet relative to the DPS sheet, which is why one shows IP/GoA as comparable and one does not.</div>

		<div id="post_message_646338">In 2_4_0_3 version of the dps spreadsheet (as well as in the older versions) GoA+Deadly Main hand+Instant Offhand is better than WF+Deadly Offhand for all gear levels if 3 or more points spent on either poison talents. <br>

In T4-T5 gear, the discrepancy is around 1% of your total damage while in T6 gear, the discrepancy is negligible.<br>
<br>
Edit: The above values are for Combat Swords build. You can expect any dagger build or shadowstep build (due to sinister calling) favor GoA more over WF.<br>

Edit2: According to my calculations, with 2.6 speed MH, 1,5 speed offhand and with slice and dice up; <br>
<br>
Untalented,<br>
Main Hand deadly poison provides 59,6 dps<br>
Offhand instant poison provides 22,6 dps<br>

The values match quite well with the poison dps values of the spreadsheet. <br>
<br>
I don't think there is anything wrong with the poison dps calculations of the last version of the spreadsheet. If we disregard the slight possibility of miscalculation of dps provided by WF or GoA, we can assume that GoA+Poison on both hands is better than WF+Deadly poison offhand. At least until you get a Warglaive in each hand.</div>

		<div id="post_message_646651">I took a quick look at the Windfury DPS sheet modeling...it's not so bad, but there are deficiencies.<br>
<br>
1)  It's modeled under the old assumption that no extra attacks will proc other extra attacks which has been proven false.  So it's missing synergy with Sword Spec especially.<br>
<br>
2)  It uses 2 as a crit factor instead of the true buffed crit multiplier.<br>
<br>
3)  It fails to add other overall damage multipliers to the Windfury damage (like Murder).<br>
<br>
4)  It doesn't feed back into the proc mechanics (but then again, proc mechanics are just beginning to get converted from estimates, so not much of an issue yet).<br>
<br>
Since each of these are underestimating the result, it's probably safe to assume for now that Windfury still edges out IP/GoA.  We'll see by how much when it gets fixed and the rest of the accurate proc mechanics go into place.</div>

</div>Late reply, I know, but:<br>
Even with a hemo build, it takes 17.5 seconds to build up 5 combopoints for a finisher. With a Ruthlessness Proc, this is only 14 seconds.<br>
On <i>avarage</i>, a Combat build with Combat Potency will be slightly ahead of the hemo build at this. Especially at higher level hasted gear (proc per strike for the win there). So 20 seconds is really a worst worst case scenario. On avarage, a Combat build will be closer to requiring only about 16 seconds to build 5 combopoints, about 10 with a Ruthlessness proc and very good Combat Potency proccing. These are rough numbers, but you get the idea. <br>
So yes, some people will gamble on getting their procs right. If they do get their procs, it's rewarding, if they don't the effect is marginal.</div>

Bumping Mutilate from (say) 30% crit to 45% crit will up it's expected damage by about 10%; assuming Mutilate was, say, 40% of your damage before, this is then a 10% increase to 40% of your damage, or about a 4% increase to Mutilate DPS (plus whatever you get from the extra combo points, an effect I expect to be fairly small).  Thus, for a 1500 DPS rogue, this change would add about 60 DPS to Mutilate, which is larger than the estimated gap between Combat Swords and Mutilate.  Additionally, Mutilate still has heavier positional dependency which will limit it's DPS in some circumstances.<br>

So, fundamentally speaking: it helps, to be sure.  And it might even be close enough that we now need to devote some attention to modeling it.  But I suspect on the whole it still runs behind Combat swords at equal itemization.<br>

That said, itemization needn't be equal; for instance, if you lack Warglaives but can get a Crux of the Apocalypse and a Shiv of Exsanguination (or some such) one might fight that the damage rivals any combat swords setup you can get without Warglaives.</div>

If relentless procs and a high crit rate you can end up doing mutilate, 4pt finisher, mutilate, 4pt finisher, repeat, for as long as you keep critting.  <br>
<br>
That keeps up Find Weakness's buff, and provides significant energy generation.  That seems to be fairly large and it should scale.  Am I missing something?</div>

</div>Well, you're not going to be able to maintain a pure 1 Mut/1 finisher rotation (assuming a 4+ CP finisher rotation, I suppose going pure 1 Mut/1 finish regardless of CPs might be worth looking at come to think of it)...with 30% crit pre-Mut talent you'll have about a 70% chance to generate 3 CPs with each mutilate.  Combined with a 60% proc chance on Ruthlessness and you're looking at being able to do 1 Mut/1 finisher about 40% of the time (perhaps as high as 50% with 4-piece T4).  Still, that's a a nice bump over the 30% chance you've got without the talent.</div>

		<div id="post_message_647885">So, two things:<br>
<br>
1) I admit I am conjecturing a bit here, but it is my impression that most people overestimate the benefit gained via extra combo points due to higher crit rate.  It helps, to be sure, but I'm reasonably sure that the majority of the damage gained via a crit is from the damage itself and not from the combo point.<br>
<br>
2) Increasing crit rate by 15% doesn't give 15% more crits; in reality, the number is more like 10% assuming a typical crit rate (with a 30% crit rate, expected  combo points per Mutilate is 2.51; with a 45% crit rate it's 2.7, which is less than 10%).  Regardless: you gain an extra .2 combo points per Mutilate.  That's 1 combo point every 5 finishers, and thus ~20 Mutilates to get enough combo points for an extra finisher - assuming you don't waste any of those procs, which you likely do (unless you're doing 3+ cycles, anyway).  So best case scenario, you get an extra Eviscerate every 2 minutes or so.  An Eviscerate does, what, 2400 average damage at the absolute maximum?  If so, we're gaining 2400/120 = 20 DPS from the combo points, and in reality I'd be willing to bet that that estimate is generous.  So is it negligible?  No.  It does have an effect.  But it's maybe a quarter the benefit of the raw crit damage and thus doesn't really change the underlying point.</div>

		<div id="post_message_647914">Thinking about it more and doing a little back of the envelope math it looks like you're definitely going to end up wasting more CPs with the new talent, at least with a 4+ cycle.  Basically, there are 2 sequences that can cause a wasted combo point:<br>
<br>
no ruthlessness proc -&gt; mut crit -&gt; mut crit<br>
<br>
and<br>
<br>
ruthlessness proc -&gt; mut non-crit -&gt; mut crit<br>
<br>
Assuming 30% base crit, the chance of wasting a combo point on any giving cycle is:<br>
<br>
without Puncturing Wounds<br>
.4*.51*.51+.6*.49*.51 = 25.4%<br>
<br>
with Puncturing Wounds<br>
.4*.6975*.6975+.6*.3025*.6975 = 32.1%<br>
<br>
I wonder if the change is enough to justify switching to a 3+ cycle (ensuring 0 wasted CPs)?<br>
<br>
edit -- hm, I didn't take into account that you generate 0 CPs if neither Mut swing hits....that'll actually increase the the proportion of hits that generate 3 CPs, and thus means even more wasted CPs.<br>
<br>
edit 2 -- if this change goes through, perhaps Mut is competitive enough that modeling it correctly should become a higher priority? *wink*</div>

I have no particular doubt in my mind that if I had a week or two and nothing better to do I could get a good Mutilate/SF model built.  It's just that I don't have that sort of free time, and I have lots of better things to be doing.<br>
<br>
Now, if people are seriously interested, I might be able to throw together some rough (very rough) approximation of what's going on for those of you who might be interested in some ballpark figures.  The level of accuracy would definitely be below what's possible for Combat Swords right now, but it might give a rough idea of stat priority and scaling.  I haven't done so already mostly because I'd rather see it done right at some point.</div>

		<div id="post_message_647991">It's actually not that hard to model.  The hardest part of a perfectly accurate modeling is the disruption to one's cycle based on so many possible outcomes and cycle lengths.  Much of that can be mitigated by intelligent adaptation of one's cycles on the fly.<br>
<br>
Much of the myth of Seal Fate being difficult to model arose from an earlier spreadsheet error in the DPS spreadsheet.  Many people called it difficult to model because the DPS spreadsheet was showing unachievable DPS amounts.  What really happened was the the spreadsheet was adding instant attack damage to every Seal Fate procced combo point.  When this bug was fixed, the displayed DPS values look to much more closely match reality.<br>
<br>
In fact, the current Seal Fate modeling (even for non-Mutilate builds) is looking pretty good now that the bug was repaired.</div>

		<div id="post_message_648163">Sorry to sway from the current mutilate discussion, but imo it's time for another look at the rogue tank theorycraft.<br>
<br>
Goal: To hit 103+% avoidance, and thus be immune to melee while still providing great anti spell in CloS, enveloping shadows, and cheat death. We already know how this works and there isn't a cap(like the 99% spell hit)due to the lv10 dodge rating sploitz - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080225115129/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmU2klgIvVE" target="_blank">YouTube - Level ten twink SOLOS VanCleef</a> and thus now all we need to know is it possible to get to that gear level. <br>
<br>
We can technically be under that, and allow for mongoose procs, ghostly strike, cheat death, evasion and various other active models, the more under we get the more odds that in a 10 minute fight we'll eventually go down due to bad luck. So I went on to warcrafter and put up a demo char, with the max possible gear. It was shockingly close to the goal, once you add in motw/grace/kings/agi elixir/agi food. Here it is~<br>
<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080225115129/http://www.warcrafter.net/sandbox/15057" target="_blank">70 Troll Rogue</a><br>
<br>
Better yet, so far the 2.4 gear is only going to make it better. ~+45 extra agility(mostly due to t2 eng and leggings of immortal beast) is easily putting it into imba range.<br>
<br>
Secondary issue being threat. The biggest advantage a rogue tank brings to a raid is that "healers" now all of a sudden actually DPS. So while a few classes might have to slow down some, even more are actually DPSing, or if there is lead up time(like on a high king maulgar based encounter) it doesn't hurt whatsoever. Better yet, on a fight like VR you would simply dodge all the knockbacks and not be harmed whatsoever ^_^.<br>
<br>
Thoughts? Anyone willing to transfer some spinels to the PTR to try it out? Will this be nerfed 5 seconds after it is perfected?</div>

</div>That stage is almost ready to be rolled out actually.  Ashtongue is currently modeled in the new format and is currently adjusted post-estimate.  The same is coming for all other proc models.  The stage after that will have a Macro iteration where the estimated values will be determined by the results, iterated a few times (in fact one could pop the Macro again and be as scientifically accurate as one desires).  <br>
<br>
What I am saying is there is a pretty reasonable model currently available which does adjust well vs. stats.  Many procs are still hit estimated, at least as they were modeled before, the rest are coming in the next update or two.</div>

</div>The current section on Executioner is based on flawed evaluation of the enchants due to a bug in the Rogue Gear Spreadsheet. Executioner still surpasses Mongoose at a certain level of gear; however, because of the Warp-Spring Coil and extremely high amounts of passive armor penetration on Sunwell gear, having Executioner on top of those things would result in wasted armor penetration much of the time on low-armor bosses. (A fully debuffed raid boss with 6200 armor goes down to 2190.)<br>
<br>
Considering that it'll be pretty difficult to avoid the armor penetration on Sunwell gear no matter what you do, it's probably the best bet simply to ignore Executioner and keep Mongoose, using Warp-Spring Coil until you have over 1190 passive armor penetration and then swapping it in on fights against high-armor bosses.</div>

</div> Sure thing. <br>
<br>
Assuming one can get to the unhitable status.. it trivializes the majority of the fights in the game. Not only does it improve DPS of the raid by swapping your prot spec warrior to a rogue, you also clearly don't need as many heals. Thus you can swap out healers for more DPS, which simplifies any 'we lose if he isn't dead by 6 minutes' encounters.

				<div style="font-style:italic">Sure thing. <br>
<br>
Assuming one can get to the unhitable status.. it trivializes the majority of the fights in the game. Not only does it improve DPS of the raid by swapping your prot spec warrior to a rogue, you also clearly don't need as many heals. Thus you can swap out healers for more DPS, which simplifies any 'we lose if he isn't dead by 6 minutes' encounters. Speaking of which, it also allows the raid to bring in extra healers in encounters where there is a great need for raid healing that also needs DPS to beat an enrage timer, as since you never get hit the enrage does nothing.</div>

</div>You completely ignore the actual realities of encounters because you're so fixated on this idea that you can dodge every attack. This isn't Final Fantasy XI. What about threat? Your DPS will be <i>terrible</i> with this spec, and you already have a built-in 29% threat reduction that you can't negate. You have no high-threat attacks or abilities either. Your DPS will be so threat-capped that encounters will take longer regardless of how many healers you leave behind.<br>
<br>
Let's look at some actual raid encounters.<br>
<br>
High King Maulgar - Yes, this is trivialized.<br>
Gruul - Your threat problems will make this fight take forever. By the time it ends, most likely Gruul's grown enough to one-shot your Hurtful tank. Or do you plan to tank the Hurtfuls too?<br>
Magtheridon - This is trivialized as well.<br>
<br>
Hydross the Unstable - Your threat problems will essentially make this impossible due to transitions.<br>
The Lurker Below - Geyser is not your friend. Additionally, if you tank any of the adds, better not expose that rear arc of yours.<br>
Leotheras the Blind - Since most of the damage is done during demon phase, the first 85% are doable. The last 15% will be hell due to your threat issues.<br>
Fathom-Lord Karathress - Not sure which one you're fixing to tank here. Priest would be essentially impossible, so I'd have to imagine Karathress himself, but I'm pretty sure Tidal Surge suppresses avoidance, so you'd be killed during that. If not, then this is trivialized.<br>
Morogrim Tidewalker - Your threat problems will make this take FOREVER. Your healers will run dry because you have forgotten that people other than the main tank sometimes take damage.<br>
Lady Vashj - Completely impossible unless you can hit 100% miss+dodge, because parry won't save you on her ranged attacks. Also better hope your shaman never misses grounding a single Shock Burst.<br>
<br>
Al'ar - No taunt, no Intercept, no Intervene, you're pretty much screwed after every Dive Bomb. On the bright side, though, you can tank even with Melt Armor.<br>
Void Reaver - An already trivial fight is further trivialized, grats.<br>
High Astromancer Solarian - Yeah, um.<br>
Kael'thas - A single uninterrupted Fireball will kill you. To the best of my knowledge, his spells can't be cloaked, but I certainly may be mistaken.<br>
<br>
Rage Winterchill - Again, an already trivial fight is further trivialized.<br>
Anetheron - Same deal.<br>
Kaz'rogal - Your threat problems will ruin any attempt. Also, I don't think his War Stomp can be dodged, it can only be resisted, so the first one that hits you will wipe the raid.<br>
Azgalor - Might be trivialized, though the Rain of Fire will make things fun for you if it happens during his Howl.<br>
Archimonde - Unless you have 3+ Fear Wards to be used exclusively on you throughout the fight without fail, this is completely impossible.<br>
<br>
High Warlord Naj'entus - Might be trivialized.<br>
Supremus - Your threat problems will force the raid to deal most of its damage during the Gaze phase, which greatly increases the threat of volcanoes.<br>
Shade of Akama - Another trivial fight further trivialized.<br>
Teron Gorefiend - Your threat problems will make this fight impossible.<br>
Gurtogg Bloodboil - Can't speak to this fight, as I haven't done it.<br>
Reliquary of Souls - Impossible due to lack of Spell Reflect.<br>
Mother Shahraz - Can't speak to this fight, as I haven't done it.<br>
Illidari Council - Can't speak to this fight, as I haven't done it.<br>
Illidan Stormrage - Obviously impossible.<br>
<br>
Considering that most of the fights you're "trivializing," you're also making take much longer due to your terrible threat, what do you really think is gained by going to the immense effort and expenditure to gear up a complete gimmick tank?<br>
<br>
(edit) Oh, how could I forget, the wonders of Cheat Death mean that in several of the situations I identified, you would not immediately die, but rather survive by the skin of your teeth. Still not buying that as a justification.</div>

This isn't simply about getting max avoidance. We use Warriors, Druids and Paladins for their AoE taunting/high-threat skills. But you knew this already, right?<br>

If you're getting sunwell gear (and passing Brutallus), I don't think your raid group is concerned with a SINGLE enrage timer in the entire game.

		<div id="post_message_648477">Okay, I think the truth of the matter with rogue tanking is somewhere in between the two perspectives put forward in the previous posts.  Is it a broadly applicable topic of use to all rogues, and thus deserving of a place in the Roguecraft 101 thread?  No.  It is primarily a gimmick, and it's only going to be useful to a few people.  But, on the other hand, as things currently stand, there are some fights that would be significantly eased through use of a 100% avoidance tank.  The aggro issues are a concern... but they're not insolvable.  Your DPS is probably 30% lower than a typical rogue's... but since you won't have salv (because you're tanking), you gain some aggro back.  Doing 70% as much damage without salv means your aggro is exactly the same as it usually is, which, while less than that of a tank (obviously) is not ridiculously much lower.<br>
<br>
In terms of which fights this is actually useful on - admittedly, it's not a lot of things.  In BT alone I can definitely see it working on Teron and Naj'entus, and Gurtogg, Reliquary, Mother, and Illidan aren't totally out of the question.  In Hyjal, Anetheron, Rage, and Azgalor are all possibilities.<br>
<br>
So, again: yes, it's something of a gimmick.  But it's a potentially useful gimmick (at least until someone actually does it, in which case a minimum avoidance chance will be rapidly hotfixed in), so it's a valid discussion topic.  But as a gimmick topic, it doesn't belong in the general rogue thread.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Well, you're not going to be able to maintain a pure 1 Mut/1 finisher rotation (assuming a 4+ CP finisher rotation, I suppose going pure 1 Mut/1 finish regardless of CPs might be worth looking at come to think of it)...with 30% crit pre-Mut talent you'll have about a 70% chance to generate 3 CPs with each mutilate.  Combined with a 60% proc chance on Ruthlessness and you're looking at being able to do 1 Mut/1 finisher about 40% of the time (perhaps as high as 50% with 4-piece T4).  Still, that's a a nice bump over the 30% chance you've got without the talent.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</div>At end-game stage one has around 40% raidbuffed crit, which would mean a 55-60% on mutilate.<br>
As for how much this can actually help mutilate raiding... Note that we haven't seen s4 weapons, so it's too early to tell, but by the looks of it, unless sporting Crux+Shiv it's not going to change much. <br>
<br>
Now if they'd change it a selfbuff that's active for 10 seconds after a Backstab or Mutilate... <br>
Although that would probably be break more things than just fixing daggers.<br>
<br>
On the 100% avoidance tanking... It would make Kalecgos quite easy, although I won't spoil it, banhammer I like not.<br>
I need to get my avoidance gear done before 2.4 goes live for that though.</div>

It's certainly true that 17/41/3 will do more damage than 15/41/5 against the targets Murder effects - but against everything else, it'll be significantly less.  So which is better?  Sort of up to you.  But with the lack of Murderable mobs in BT/Hyjal, I'd someone lean towards skipping Murder for more general-purpose damage.</div>

Going through your list besides the wrong threat issues, ShS lurkers Geyser, and after A'lars bombings to keep the threat pumping. You can survive a kael fireball, it's just going to hurt a whole lot. Optimal? Maybe not.<br>

		<div id="post_message_650223">Sorry to troll, but I was making a quick look at the Rogue finishers and combo point efficiency etc and it crossed my mind that the first point spent on each and every finisher is by far the most efficient in terms of damage/buff uptime per combo point. Take a look at Slice and Dice, it's 12 seconds (talented) for the first point, and only an addition 3 seconds for each point after that. Surely under these circumstances using 1 point finishers would yield a higher dps than the standard cycles? For instance, 1 point SnD, 1 point Rupture, 1 point Evisc while Rupture is ticking away and then possibly a new 1 point Rupture before refreshing SnD.<br>
<br>
Naturally, combo points gained for free would have no effect on this because they're free and therefore don't impact the amount of energy being spent in total. Also, in regards to energy gained from 5 point finishers, since it's a 20% chance per cp you should theoretically get the same amount of energy back over the total duration of the fight by spamming 1 point finishers as you would by using fewer 5 point finishers.<br>
<br>
In any case, I could be missing something horribly obvious, feel free to correct me with impunity if I am.</div>

		<div id="post_message_650229">So, I think there's two main things that you're overlooking.<br>
<br>
First, Relentless Strikes means larger finishers cost less energy; thus, there is some abstract advantage to doing larger ones.<br>
<br>
Secondly: Finishers are only useful to the extent that they convert energy into damage with a higher efficiency than your combo point generator.  As it turns out, while the damage per *combo point* is higher at low numbers of combo points, that's not very meaningful since the damage per *energy* is lower - in fact, the damage per energy of a 1 point Eviscerate is significantly lower than that of a Sinister Strike.<br>
<br>
Fundamentally, Combo Points are only worth damage to the extent that they improve the efficiency of your damage-per-energy efficiency, so at the very least you want to save them up till they actually increase your DPE efficiency rather than lowering it.  In practice, it has been shown - both in practice and via the spreadsheets - that compressing SnD tends to be worthwhile, but compressing the other finishers is not - which is why, for instance, the optimal Combat Swords cycle consists of doing the largest possible Rupture and the smallest possible SnD (for most rogues, anyway).</div>

<br>
1 sinister strike + 1 rupture = 40 energy + 25 energy ( -5 for the 20% chance of a refund from relentless) = 60 energy for a sinister strike, and a pathetic damage rupture<br>
<br>
5 sinister strike + 1 rupture = 200 energy + 25 energy ( -25 for the 100% chance of a refund from relentless) = 200 energy for 5 sinister strikes, and a much stronger rupture.<br>
<br>
Looking purely at sinister strike in these circumstances, in one circumstance, sinister strike is 60energy per CP of the finisher, and in the other it's 40, not only that, but in the second case, rupture does more damage.<br>

This is over simplified, but i believe it shows pretty clearly the hole.<br>

</div>Well you simply could have entered the items into one of the readily available spreadsheets and would already have the solution. Or you might have looked at the items and noticed that not only does the OH claw have more dps, it also has better stats than the ZA sword (which can be expected when you compare an iLevel 132 sword with an Level 146 claw).<br>
<br>
Considering the "dual spec" claw/fist you mention it's also worth noting that you didn't tell where you would distribute the 5 talentpoints from swordspec into, when only speccing into claw.<br>
<br>
Nevertheless: dual claw is suprerior to claw/ZA-sword, but how much better depends on what you do with the 5 talentpoints more than on the OH weapon.</div>

</div>Well, if you manage to spec Mutilate in the Rogue Gear sheet, I'll be seriously impressed as it's not even supported.  The DPS sheet has an estimate that is... decent, I think.  I haven't spent a whole lot of time looking at it, but there are definitely some subtleties missing.<br>
<br>
From ballpark estimates done by various people, Puncturing Wounds will bring Mutilate closer to Combat Swords, but still decidedly behind at equivalent itemization.<br>
<br>
It would be nice to come up with a  more detailed model of it including all the subtleties; it's just a matter of someone taking the time to do so.<br>

</div>The first post is a bit outdated on the question of Mongoose vs Executioner.  The value of Executioner was being overestimated due to a bug in the Rogue Gear sheet.  The new answer for Mongoose vs Executioner is that Mongoose is better in almost all circumstances.</div>

		<div id="post_message_650900">The DPS Spreadsheet should give a very good estimation (when it is updated to include the change).  Although, there is a post in the DPS Spreadsheet thread that describes how to implement that change right now.<br>
<br>
3/4 of the cycle sheets are devoted to Mutilate.  This code was in existence before my involvement with the spreadsheet, but it really is rather brilliant work.  As soon as the Seal Fate bug issue was resolved, the Mutilate damage estimates are looking good.  It takes an average of a number of possible cycles (given that Mutilate and Seal Fate can have variable cycle lengths).  <br>
<br>
It's not perfectly accurate (if one wants to talk subtlety) but neither is either spreadsheet.  Neither spreadsheet accounts for every possibility of cycles given various up or down times of haste effects (clearly a cycle will get more Combat Potency procs when DST is up than when its not), so clearly some "subtlety" is lost even in the Gear spreadsheet.  I suggest that until someone actually spends the time to write one of these long talked about Mutilate combat simulators or implements a better estimation in a spreadsheet, the DPS spreadsheet is still the best available model for Mutilate.<br>
<br>
Looking over the Mutilate code, its one of the finer pieces of code in the spreadsheet and gives a very decent estimation of one's DPS (and resulting equivalencies).  As such, its a very low priority for any sort of overhaul.  There are other issues that are scheduled for improvement; other minor bugs that have been discovered; other things that will continue to improve every version.<br>
<br>
The short story:  Make the change suggested in the DPS thread (or wait for next update - probably next weekend).  See for yourself where your DPS comes out relative to other specs.  I believe the results should be in the ballpark as it compares to other specs in actuality.</div>

</div>Disregarding for a second about the discrepency with the 5 points not in combat swords, realizing you can't entirely do that, out of the gate, is it better to purchase the Season 3 equivalent fists then attempt to acquire a main and off sword for combat swords? Also i haven't seen any charts yet comparing swords vs fists from the PTR but what is the overall assessment of the max DPS with these new items? And due to this does this combination of combat fists beat combat swords?<br>
<br>
Also, someone commented on possible profession combinations, (i do not remember the page it was originally on), I personally am Max Engineer(390 gnome racial) and Max LW so when 2.4 comes out, I can make 3 pieces of gear<br>

With a mainhand sword offhand fist, sword spec will proc infrequently, to the point of not being a worthwhile use of talent points.  In addition, the damage range on the right fist vs. talon is quite close, 4 points lower isn't a big difference, and the weapon dps is 5 higher - that's like the difference between S2 and S3 weapons.<br>

Quick question. When you ran the top and bottom cases (ToA + Savagery and Vengeful Slicer + Savagery) did you keep the dual-specialization talent spec? I ask because when using two swords in a mix/max situation you can stick those points from Fist Spec into poison talents in the Assassination tree, which will have a small but non-negligible impact on your dps.<br>
<br>
When I ran similar calculations with the Rogue Gear Spreadsheet, I found that Vanir's Right Fist + Blade of Savagery (dual weapon specs) was slightly higher than Blade of Infamy + Blade of Savagery (Single Spec) but slightly lower than Vengeful Slicer + Blade of Savagery (Also Single Spec).<br>
<br>
Of course we're talking about &lt; 10 dps differences so I think it really comes down to what is practical / available to you.</div>

Ald assuming you have fixed the overvaluing of exec in the newest version of the gear spreadsheet. With full sunwell/dual glaives for 7685 AC on bosses.<br>
Mongoose: 188.2<br>
Exec: 187.108<br>
<br>
Now if i lower the AC to 7600 <br>
Mongoose: 188.216<br>
Exec: 188.414<br>

From then on exec beats it all the way to 6200 ending at<br>
Mongoose: 188.481<br>
Exec: 212.801<br>

With my current gear:<br>
7685 AC<br>
Mongoose: 179.277<br>
Exec: 175.856<br>
6200 AC<br>
Mongoose: 180.511<br>
Exec: 178.023<br>

		<div id="post_message_652547">Depends on exactly what buffs you run with, and to some extent what trinkets you have available to you.  Also note that this answer is somewhat subject to what further loots become available in Sunwell.<br>
<br>
Anyway, using the default buffs in the sheet and full Sunwell + Warglaives gear, I show Mongoose 9 DPS ahead on 7700 armor bosses (1986 to 1977) and 1 DPS ahead on 6200 armor bosses (2201 to 2200).  Using the buffs my guild actually raids with, Mongoose wins by 6 on 7700 armor bosses (2294 to 2288) and 2 on low-armor bosses (2564 to 2562).  So for me, at every conceivable level of itemization, Mongoose appears to be better.<br>
<br>
This is not to say that there don't exist combinations of gear and buff that will make Executioner better for people; I'm sure such things exist, and I don't want to discourage people from checking for themselves - that's why we have spreadsheets, after all.  But for me, at least, Executioner never catches up to Mongoose in terms of DPS given all known sunwell itemization... though the arrival of new trinkets could change the situation.<br>
<br>
Now, it also might be noted that this is just a DPS computation.  I know many of you disagree with me about this (which is fine), but the fact that Mongoose also gives some dodge should also be remembered.  I know in theory we should never be taking hits and thus never need to dodge anything, but, lets face it, these things happen.  And having an extra 6+% dodge 40% of the time strikes me as potentially useful in that respect.  Is it worth trading a *lot* of DPS for?  Certainly not.  But personally, even if I wound up in a situation where Executioner was 2 additional DPS relative to Mongoose, I'd probably still use Mongoose, since a .1% reduction in DPS seems a reasonable trade for that amount of dodge.</div>

</div>I don't see what you hope to gain by refusing to read even a single page's worth of posts which happen to cover this exact same topic. I notice you edited your post to remove the line of "PS Please run this through your spreadsheet since I don't have one" <br>
<br>
I think it would do you good to take plenty of time to read over the first post of this thread, at the bottom there are two links provided to the Rogue DPS and Gear spreadsheets. Take your time playing with these spreadsheets to learn what's the best upgrades for you and after that, try reading the last 3-4 pages of the thread so you won't look like a fool by repeating a question that has been addressed and discussed over the last 10-15 posts. <br>
<br>
Good luck.</div>

		<div id="post_message_652874">I am having some concerns about my dps versus other people at my level of progression.  I'm pretty much set up in full T4/kara/badge gear, socketed with rigid dawnstone, etc.  I use the 1s/5r cycles, I use relentless flasks and eat spicy talbuk, I pop my cooldowns often and try to use them at the same time if possible.  Here is the situation:<br>
<br>
We have another rogue in my guild, who constantly outdoes me.  He does not use rupture, does not socket hit rating, uses instant poison over deadly, eats AP food, does not follow cycles.  He has 2pc T5, I have 4pc T4.  He's got about 80 AP on me, I have about 40 hit rating on him (60 when using talbuk food).  Last night in SSC, in a perfect melee dps group of fury war, enh shaman, feral druid, and two rogues, he was ahead of me in dps by almost 300, his 1160 to my 880. <br>
<br>
My ruptures did more damage than his eviscerates, my DP did more damage than his IP, I gained more energy thru the fight, I got more hits.  However, his average damage on melee hits was about 40 more and on crits 70 more.  I believe it takes 14 AP to increase damage by 1, so his 40 damage is the equivalent of 560 AP???  <br>
<br>
This is not an isolated issue, either.  He has been consistently doing a significant amount (1%+ of raid dps) more damage than me despite the fact that with my stats, I *should* be ahead in damage.  What am I missing?<br>
<br>
I am also concerned that other rogues in similar gear, at our level of progression, seem to be hitting much higher numbers in terms of dps than we are.  I see WWS reports with rogues in similar (sometimes slightly better) gear doing 1300+ dps.  Do other rogues chain haste pots or something?  I can't figure out how to make my rogue do any more damage than he does, and yet I always seem to fall short.</div>

</div>I just looked at your specc too... is there any reason you skipped vitality?  That extra agility is going to increase your AP and Crit % and I would think that would be more useful than the nerves or steel or even the imp poisons.  It might just mean that the other rogue is getting more AP and more crits as a result.  Just a guess though.</div>

</div>I came to the same conclusion; the new 2.4 fist weapon and fist+swordspec is little better on excel than Blade of Infamy+poisonspec (offhand is Blade of Savagery in both cases, and rest of the eq is T6-level). Dropping 4 points from vile poisons is -11dps, putting 5 to fistspec and wielding Vanir's Right Fist gives +15.5dps. So, if you are missing Blade of Infamy, the fist is a bit better, as is S3 MH sword with poisonspec. Numbers are with normal raidbuffs and war+shaman.<br>
<br>
The result isn't surprising, as I've been dualspecced before (MH kael's mace/OH S2 sword) and the excel has always followed reality closely enough.</div>

</div>Hey there, can anyone please explain to me, how it comes that Combat Daggers start with only -0,5% compared to Swords in Tier 4 and in Tier 6 even come out after Combat Maces? Is this only due to the weapons available (assuming  used spreadsheet to determine every builds dps), meaning the maces are simply better than the daggers?</div>

Quite surprising, though largely caused by the stats on the fist vs the lack of stats on the pvp sword.</div>

</div>4/5 Vile would be a better comparison since you are picking up DPS talents by going Fist Spec, so you should compare it to a build where you put those 5 points in the highest possible DPS talents remaining when going Sword Spec.  The normal build in my experience is 4/5 Vile and 1/2 Nerves of Steel.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">No, Patchwerk and Teron are the gold standard.  Gruul has variable amounts of time out of combat where Rupture/Poison might still be ticking, you can play it safe and stay out, you might be punted, and you may have to hold back due to aggro.  Shadowstep would actually have a lot of advantages on that fight, due to the fact that you have to spend a significant amount of time running away/running back.  Curator is dependent on your strategy/cooldown usage, Aran again strategy, and Prince is dependent on positioning, enfeebles and infernals, aka none of them are good fights.  Of the fights in Kara, Attunmen is the best DPS mark due to the fact that you can simply stay on him 100% of the time, with Maiden probably being #2.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</div>I went with Gruul because that is about where he is on progression.  Teron would be better, but he's not there yet.<br>
<br>
I picked the Kara fights for different reasons.  I picked Curator because I was curious how a shadowstep rogue would do on a fight with lots of quickly-killed adds and bouncing between targets.  Intuitively, I would think they'd perform well because of less time wasted chasing down flares.  Aran is a fight rogues usually do very well on.  Prince is one they often don't do well on because of nova/enfeebles but that a shadowstep rogue could possibly do better on than a straight combat rogue thanks to cheat death and being able to bamf back to him after a nova.<br>
<br>
I didn't think about Maiden because she's such a short fight, but you're right about Attumen probably being best.  I don't even think about him as a boss anymore, so he completely slipped my mind.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">You're probably overthinking it.  I'm talking about in terms of _time_ required to put and keep SnD up.  With 0 combo points on a target it takes five sinister strikes to be able to 5 point SnD.  Therefore you must have spent 200 energy gaining your points and 25 releasing them for a total of 225 energy, meaning that you must have spent 225/20(e tick) = 11.25 ticks of energy rounded up to 12 ticks = 24 seconds that you need in order to build and pop a 30 second SnD.  Since you have used 225 energy worth of combo points and 24 seconds to put up SnD for 30 seconds - you have spent 7.5 energy per second of SnD.<br>
<br>
As a Hemo/SF rogue, it will take an average of near 3 hemos (considering 40% crit) to build 5 points.  This rogue has spent 130 energy, = 7 ticks of energy = 14 seconds for 21 seconds of SnD, = 6.2 e/s.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</div>My point is that napkin math doesn't work for Rogue Theorycraft.  You can't value finishers based off of time or anything like that, the only concern is total DPS of the full rotation, and the calculation you are doing doesn't have any relevance to anything.  That is like saying you can only Sinister Strike every 4 seconds, it isn't true either, and again isn't relevant when comparing specs.<br>
<br>
Your math there is flawed first of all because 100% of the time that cycle would cost 200 energy, not 225.  Also, analyzing finishers independent of the build and the rest of the cycle doesn't work.  The relative cost of S&amp;D in my application is 0, because the real and opportunity cost are 0.  If I have 5 Combo Points, I can either SS again for 40, or do S&amp;D which costs 25 energy, but generates 25 energy, thus the cost is 0.<br>
<br>
Based off your math the most efficient cycle would be 1s/1r because you get the most S&amp;D uptime per combo point/energy.  You also don't take into account the lost DPS from having to S&amp;D 50% more often that could instead be used to use Rupture.  Basically you are taking far too simplistic of a view, and of course when you disregard or ignore everything that would make your hypothesis wrong, then it is easy to conclude that you are correct, in this case you are wrong.<br>

If you'll look up a few you'll notice that Aldriana proved my point in numbers more your style.  Point being that SF/Hemo offers higher cps during any cycle for more finishing damage.  I mean, I'd be pretty pissed if that weren't the case with Seal Fate.  Point being that Seal Fate does more for your rota than just compensate for not having Imp. SnD.<br>

The point I think people have been trying to make for 2 pages or so now, is that if you want to spec something other than the accepted top DPS spec because you think it is more fun (or less "lame") then fine, do it. We're not trying to stop you.<br>
<br>
However, don't come into a thread designed around theorycrafting maximum possible rogue dps and try to say that your spec is somehow superior (or equal) in damage to the spec that has been mathematically proven to be the best. "Lameness" doesn't come into our calculations in this thread (or forum for that matter), only maximum damage output.<br>
<br>
Again, if you have more fun playing it, and that's all you care about, then by all means. Hell, I stayed Shadowstep for Hyjal last week and while my damage was atrocious, it was the most fun I've had raiding that godawful instance in probably 6 months. But I wouldn't for a second think of doing that on progression content where maximizing dps is a major concern.</div>

</div>No one was particularly flaming you; you're just wrong, is all.  You proposed an alternate spec and asked for opinions.  I expressed the opinion that it wasn't particularly good.  You disagreed and gave reasons.  Myself and others than gave more detailed explanations, showing the errors in your estimates, and more fully demonstrating it's inferiority. There's no personal attack here - or at least, that's not my intent.  It's just the build you proposed, regardless of it's lameness or lack thereof - is just plain not as good as the other available options.  The reason why people spec to boost their white damage is because it works - it's really that simple.  White damage is the majority of the damage you do as a rogue, so boosting it just plain works better than any other approach - hence, lame or not, it yields higher DPS.  You're welcome to spec however you want, of course, but that's wholly separate from the issue of how much DPS the spec does.   And the DPS the spec does, according to all the theorycraft and napkinmath we've done, is going to be lower than the damage that Combat Swords does.  So until you have some evidence otherwise (see Shaker's post for information on what would suffice in that respect), I don't really see much point in further discussion.  We theorycrafted, we discussed, we concluded it sucked, and it's time to move on.</div>

		<div id="post_message_655909">Very likely. Agility and hit rating come out close to each other as far as their respective DPS increases, and I keep a stack of mudfish on me for trash as well as my stack of talbuk. With FLK, though, I'd just go with the hit rating food, unless you were -really- butting up against the hit cap. That's not usually a good idea, anyway, as you don't want to have to regem to make room for an imp faerie fire if one comes your way. Someone can feel free to correct me if I'm wrong, though.<br>
<br>
edit: Looking at your gear, you have some room before the hit cap. I'd say that you'll probably end up getting more milage out of hit rating food on that right than agility food. On trash, though, agility food might not be uncalled for.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Rough numbers on run speed:<br>
<br>
With my current gear, according to the rogue gear sheet, I do 1486.91 DPS.  The loss of 6 agility reduces this to 1482.92.<br>
<br>
Lets assume that without Cat's Swiftness, I spend X seconds out of every minute moving; thus, my damage per minute is (60-X)*1486.91.  With Cat's Swiftness, it would instead be (60-x/1.08)*1482.92.  Equating these and solving for X, we find that the break-even point is at X = 2.1.  So, by this estimate, if you're spending more than 2.1 seconds out of every minute moving, Cat's Swiftness is better.<br>
.... &lt;snipped&gt;....<br>
<br>
In brief: 12 agi and Cat's Swiftness are competitive enchants, with each being superior on some fights.  Surefooted is generally inferior from a PvE perspective.</div>

</div>The same should apply to Shadowstep, giving Shadowstep higher dps contribution than spreadsheet calculates on any fight where movement is needed. Also, on fights like archimonde, every melee usually spend x amount of time unable to reach the boss due to fire between them and boss. Shadowstep makes it possible to jump over the fire. Also on the same fight, I believe (although I haven't tested it) that shadowstepping to the boss just as airburst hits would make you able to skip the whole air-burst giving more on-target time.</div>

</div>This works, yes. It makes the fight a lot more fun. But if melee doesn't get airbursted a lot, your damage will suck compared to the rest, and even if they do you won't get phenominally far ahead due to subtlety's low personal dps.</div>

The DPS difference is about 15% as stated on page one. So for some rogues the increased survivability (stay out of the f***ing fire) and mobility may actually increase their DPS. On very movement intense fights (Al'ar as example) Shadow Step may result in more damage. The DPS is way lower, but the DPS uptime is increased a lot.</div>

<br>
and this guy, willsucks, had some interesting theories. See post 29. While i, ofcourse, dont agree with hes hate for shadowpanther this idea seems pretty cool. Anyone tried it? <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302040558im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":)" class="inlineimg">  It basically mean you save energy for 2-3 SS to use when the mob have debuffs, making these SS have more AP and higher crit chance.<br>
<br>
quoting:<br>
<br>
"Pool energy.<br>
Don't go over 85 post tick if.<br>
<br>
65-85, hit SS right as/before you tick up to 85, might want to use a swing timer to monitor your OH strikes if you get as into it as I am - LD50 Abar is a good one.<br>
<br>
60-80, you want to hit it 1 sec before you tick to 100 OR combat potency procs, if you're squeemish about getting this close, just do it as you tick to 80.<br>
<br>
Monitor your mongoose &amp; perceived weakness (if applicable) buffs.<br>
You want to spam your energy down on a triple, or at least double proc. If you get a single proc, keep saving energy. Wait until that proc gets down to about 4-5 seconds, then spam your energy down to take advantage of it before it runs off.<br>
<br>
This allows you to invest more energy in proc events.<br>
<br>
It's micromanagement and it requires a lot of attention not to tunnel vision and screw up on something else, some might say an inordinate amount of attention - I obviously don't think so as I play this game as a sort of meditation, but it is a DPS increase.<br>
<br>
Make sure you're still monitoring CPs, SND &amp; rupture timers so you can still calculate your rotations. Get your CPs in regardless of procs for your rotation, but be wary of low and high energy zones."</div>

</div>First, I think it is legitimate to think about easily accessible bosses for DPS-testing at T4/5-level because that's were most players are. And there might be different results at T6 and T5 level as we know from the hemo/trispec debate.<br>
<br>
If I really want to compare the raw DPS potential of talent builds, I need a boss where all talent points that directly result in dps of both specs do have an effect. Murder and Vile Poisons being part of standard combat swords builds and rupture being the best finisher, I would want to compare builds on a poisonable and rupturable boss where Murder works. This could be Gruul (with the obvious ground slam problems). It could be Magtheridon, too (unless I have to work the cubes).<br>
<br>
My favorite at T4/5-level is Morogrim, because watery graves are only minor downtimes, pointing out clearly where comparison will not be 100% exact (just count them...). The tricky thing with Karazhan is that you just can't rely on all bosses being rupturable or poisonable. If I remember correctly, Attumen does not bleed, so he's not perfect. I agree, that Maiden would be ok, but the fight gets really short with epic equipment. Aditionally 10-mens generally have a tendency to lack buffs, and some builds scale better than other. Otherwise I'd suggest Zul'Aman's Nalorrak to be a pretty good testing boss.<br>
<br>
In regards to the question which buff food to chose: Check it in your spreadsheet. Even with a lot to go until reaching the hit cap, warp burgers can be better. It just depends on your equip, talent build, buffs. For me (±270 +hit) it's better in any situation by a tiny margin... but I'm a dagger rogue and somehow reached a efficiency-cap for hit (i.e. Hit&lt;1AEP).</div>

</div>I'm combat daggers currently also.  I carry both +hit and +agi food.  I have noticed that the agility food gives my dps a bigger boost on trash and on fights with more running in and out, (like Gruul) and the +hit food works better for the longer sustained "tank and spank" boss fights.  Also, normally I end up in a group with a feral druid and get the +crit buff, but when I don't, I find the agility food is a bigger boost for the +crit.  My hit unbuffed is around 290 right now and my crit is around 28%.  I'm not great with math, but I think it makes sense that the +agi food will give you more crits and AP and on mobile fights, energy regen isn't as big an issue.  Whereas the sustained fights require more hits for potency to procc, allowing for more backstabs which are a larger % of a combat daggers dps.  I do not know if combat swords finds that different foods boost their fights depending on style as well.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Fist spec is diminished by overall missed attacks, etc. It's not actually going to be a 5% crit gain in a raid v/s a 73 mob. Depends on your hit rate and expertise.<br>
<br>
Mace spec however is not mitigated but rather enhanced by set bonuses, % buffs, procs, RED, etc..<br>
<br>
The real reason Mace spec is good right now is itemisation. Rod of the Sun King is one of the best MH weapons(aside from glaive), it just happens to be a mace. =/ The limits of every spec is solely dependant on itemisation. I've found that I have to go with the flow and maximize my spec with what drops.<br>
<br>
Try out Mace MH/Sword OH with 16/45/0 combat mace/sword spec.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</div>That doesn't make sense, misses are not possible missed crits, a 5% increase to my critical chance equates out to 5% more damage.  I still miss just as often with 20% crit and 25% crit, but with fist spec, you lose 5% "Hit" attacks, and gain 5% "Crit" attacks.  I have 313 hit rating(+Precision) with food, so roughly 4% miss chance on white hits, and the normal 5 expertise for a dwarf combat spec'd rogue.<br>
<br>
Spec'd TSH with 2/2 WEx and 4/5 Mace spec, I managed 640~ dps on the Oz fight in kara, so actual DPS would be higher on say, Attumen.<br>
<br>
So, let's just say 700dps.  <br>
 - About 85% of my DPS is whites/hemos, so 25% of that 85% should be crit damage.<br>
 - 85% of 700dps = 595dps<br>
 - 25% of 595 is 148.75dps<br>
 - So, my criticals contribute 148.75dps to my total, so mace spec would add 5% more of that, thus a 7.4375 dps upgrade from mace spec.<br>
<br>
 - 700dps*5% = 35dps<br>
<br>
So, unless the "overall missed attacks, etc" accounts for 28.4dps loss, I don't follow.<br>
<br>
Also, according to my assessment report of Opera through Aran in kara, I missed approx. 1.1% of total attacks, explained by being over the hit cap on non-bosses and the fact that I had 352hit rating then.<br>
<br>
Also, as much as I like min/maxing with TSH/Combat, I'm doing 41/20 mutilate, I just find it more fun.<br>
<br>
Being that I don't have access to SSC/TK+ level stuff yet, the best weapons available are swords/fists/daggers.<br>
<br>
Now, this is just the math as I understand it, if I've got anything wrong, feel free to point it out.</div>

		<div id="post_message_658697">No, you're more or less on target.  I think the easiest way to look at is as follows:<br>
<br>
Mace spec adds 5% of your weapon damage to 40% of your attacks, or roughly a 2% of your weapon DPS.<br>
Fist spec adds 100% of your weapon damage to 5% of your attacks, or roughly 5% of your weapon DPS.<br>
<br>
Now, the itemization points are somewhat valid; it is true that there's sort of a deficit of good fists from raiding (until 2.4, anyway, but I digress).  However, it's also true that Talon of the Phoenix - and Talon of Azshara - and Blade of Infamy - are all better than Rod of the Sun King in practice (because mace spec is relatively weak).  So from an optimal raid DPS perspective, there's really not much reason to ever go maces.<br>
<br>
Not to mention the fact that the availability of pvp weapons reduces the need to worry about itemization constraints; really, the only reason to ever do anything other than sword/sword is the novelty value (fist spec isn't far behind, but it is behind; and as long as you're buying a pvp weapon and have your choice, why not pick the best one?)</div>

</div>Not *quite*.  It doesn't make your crits do quad dmg, but turns 5% of your attacks from hits to crits.  If you had a 100% chance to hit (no miss, glance, dodge, crit, etc).. this would be true.  If you had a really really low hit and crit, you may well be getting greater than a 5% increase in dmg from 5% more crits.  Most likely however, you are getting slightly less than 5% added dmg from crits - somewhere around or just under 4%.<br>

I have no doubt YOU are aware of that Ald.. just clarifying in general.</div>

		<div id="post_message_658719">Thing is, that effect applies equally.  That math is a bit misleading in that you don't actually "do" 100% weapon damage (but hey, it's napkin math, what do you want).  But both of them are taking the same percentage of whatever abstract concept you're measuring.<br>
<br>
So, to spell this out a little more closely: lets say you make 100 swings.  On the average in 100 swings, you have, say, <br>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304045844im_/http://elitistjerks.com/cgi-bin/mathtex.cgi?c" alt="c"> crits<br>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304045844im_/http://elitistjerks.com/cgi-bin/mathtex.cgi?h" alt="h"> hits<br>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304045844im_/http://elitistjerks.com/cgi-bin/mathtex.cgi?m" alt="m"> misses (omitting glances and dodges for clarity).  Your total base damage is then <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304045844im_/http://elitistjerks.com/cgi-bin/mathtex.cgi?2c%20+%20h" alt="2c + h">.<br>
<br>
With mace spec, the crits now do 2.05x damage.  Thus, you now do <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304045844im_/http://elitistjerks.com/cgi-bin/mathtex.cgi?2.05c%20+%20h" alt="2.05c + h"> damage, an increase of <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304045844im_/http://elitistjerks.com/cgi-bin/mathtex.cgi?.05c" alt=".05c">.  Thus, with a 40% crit rate (<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304045844im_/http://elitistjerks.com/cgi-bin/mathtex.cgi?c%20=%2040" alt="c = 40">), you gain an extra 2 swings worth of damage.<br>
<br>
With fist spec, you now have <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304045844im_/http://elitistjerks.com/cgi-bin/mathtex.cgi?c+5" alt="c+5"> crits and <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304045844im_/http://elitistjerks.com/cgi-bin/mathtex.cgi?h-5" alt="h-5"> hits.  Thus, your total damage is <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304045844im_/http://elitistjerks.com/cgi-bin/mathtex.cgi?2(c+5)%20+%20(h-5)%20=%202c+h+5" alt="2(c+5) + (h-5) = 2c+h+5">, an increase of 5.<br>
<br>
So by "base weapon damage", what I mean is "the average damage done by a hit" - which is not the same thing as the amount of damage you're actually doing (though it is related).  The relevant point is that your overall weapon damage increases by 5% of some quantity X for fist spec, and (assuming 40% crit rate) 2% of that same quantity for Mace Spec.<br>
<br>
Admittedly, the real situation is vastly more complicated due to yellow damage, lethality, RED, and so on; but in terms of napkinmath and intuition, it should be clear that fist spec is a fair amount better.</div>

</div>Well, yes, it brings it to ~3-4% vs. 5%, which is so close as to make the weapon itemization much more important.<br>
<br>
I was going off some other posts in this thread (can't find them atm), plus the wording on the talent. Lethality, which is additive, increases the "critical strike damage <i>bonus</i>" of certain attacks. RED, which is multiplicative, says "3% increased critical damage." Mace spec says "increases the damage done by your critical strikes with maces", which leads me to believe it is multiplicative. Testing for verification would certainly be helpful, though.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">My understanding is that RED multiplies but Mace Spec adds, though it might be worth doublechecking that.  It doesn't really affect the underlying point, though; if Mace Spec *does* add, while it certainly narrows the gap between maces and fists, maces are still behind for a crit rate under 50%.</div>

</div>I beg to differ but offer no real math behind it. I'm at 40% crit buffed, 43% with sanctified crusader. With current itemisation Rod v/s Talon MH and Savagery OH, maces comes out on top. I gain on average 60 energy during a 4 minute encounter with the Rod. On top of having a big top end difference, T6 4/5 bonus, mace spec bonus, RED, I'm getting alot more SS damage than I would with the talon. As far as I know, mace spec multiplies just like RED.<br>
<br>
Is there a way I can test this for sure? I wouldn't mind doing it because I'd like to know for myself. (Lvl 1 mace v/s lvl 1 sword/fist with the same min/max and speed over say 5 minutes of autoattacks with no gear on and no OH?)<br>
<br>
In my previous post I didn't mean that mace/sword spec was better, I just said that with current PvE itemisation, it's better than fist/sword.<br>
<br>
In 2.4 it'll be completely different with the new PvE weapons, etc.<br>
<br>
You could argue that Season 3 weapons are part of current itemisation but in that sense pure sword/sword is best anyway. Also some people don't have the time/patience for arena.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I assume the huge gap on the Eagle is due to some well-timed Blade Flurries on birds? Cause it seems kind of backwards; unless you're collapsing on the tank for storms, I'd think that being able to Shadowstep back into melee would be a bit of a boost compared to, say, the Bear.</div>

</div>We collapse on the tank, and basically ignore the birds (Warlock might seed), so my time on the boss is 99% or higher, occasionally the storm comes early and I have to back out a little (I think I backed out once on the Shadowstep run, slightly, cloaked and stepped back in, so not even a full storm duration.  The whole point of the run is to steamroll the bosses, so everything else is second to DPS, and in Full T6, it really isn't an issue.<br>
<br>
Also, forgot to mention I got the cloak off Teron between runs, which should contribute about 10 DPS to the Shadowstep run.</div>

</div>Calculating your DPS without using a spreadsheet would be an interesting project, but you have to take into account all the variables, from dodges, to glancing blows, to buff times, to procs.  Based on your gear, I assume your raid experience and experience with min-maxing is pretty limited, so working through it will also probably make you a better rogue.  If you want someone to look over the math and check it for accuracy feel free to post it here.<br>
<br>
Also, don't forget when doing a project like this you will need to include all of the assumptions, which are known here but aren't known outside of the theorycrafting community (things like 15.8 Hit Rating = 1% to hit, base miss rate = 28% for Duel Wield, etc.)</div>

And to the math thing - what level math are you at?  There's some really interesting math that's been done and I'm sure several people could point you towards a neat application based on your level.  In particular, if you're up around the calculus level, a Newton's Method approximation of DPS addition from the DST proc would be a pretty slick show, and should be easy enough to explain to a teacher without going into "Well, you have to stand off the back right leg of dragons, because they have TAILS and HEADS, of course, each with their own dangers".</div>

(edit) Ah, my mistake. That, however, seems easy enough to test. Pick up a white mace with a 1-3 damage range, and beat on a mob until you've gotten a whole bunch of hits and a whole bunch of crits. Make sure you're not wearing RED or using any AP procs. Divide crit damage by hit damage. 2.10 versus 2.05 should be pretty noticeable.</div>

To figure out which is better for you in particular, I recommend consulting your local neighborhood spreadsheet, both of which are linked in the first post.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">The the sake of satisfying my personal curiosity, I did our bi-weekly Bear Farming run last night as Shadowstep (20/0/41), because I really didn't feel like dropping 100g to respec back to combat for a 40 min ZA run.  Anyway, for those interested, here are 2 runs, one as Combat, one as Shadowstep, with the same exact group, same buffs and everything.<br>

	</table>
</div>Since I am a big fan of Shadowstep, my interpretation could be a little bit biased. However, from what I have seen in your values and from my experiences, the difference between these two builds does not seem to be as high as it has been made out. <br>
<br>
A 100-120 dps difference is as much as hemo debuff provides to the raid. So if your values can be generalized, Shadowstep did on par with Combat Swords on all bosses other than the Eagle boss. Basically, single target dps of the both builds seem to be close to each other and combat seem to win out by blade flurry.<br>
<br>
Shadowstep build could even be used more aggressively than you did in a 5+minutes fight. You could have vanished+premeditated and garroted for instant 3-4 cp generation and for garrote damage and you can do it 2 or 3 times with prep and elusiveness. <br>
<br>
The only thing that set combat build back might be that you are using proc based trinkets. If you don't care for proc timing when you blow cooldowns, you could have missed the synergy of trinket procs with cooldowns like AR or BF.</div>

</div>First off I am using some of the Hemo charges, and best case scenario you getting about 100 DPS from the debuff, if you assume I got 20-30 more of that DPS then I would in a full raid, you are seeing more like 150 DPS difference.  <br>

</div>I theory that sounds good, in practice, I found that doing that sucked for the same reason vanishing as combat isn't a good idea unless you need the aggro drop.  Basically you completely offset the DPS gain with the loss of auto attacks during the vanish.  I really even had a hard time justifying using Shadowstep on bosses because between the 10 energy, possible loss of an auto attack (it seems to reset the swing timers), I wasn't sure if it was actually doing more DPS then just using that energy as part of a normal cycle (and I really only used it for 5 point ruptures).<br>

I logged our run again last night and will parse it this evening to see how it compares, and depending on how rich I am feeling I might try Combat Shadowstep for the next run to see how it compares, since I think the DPS will be better over all (S&amp;D is a PITA without the talented version).  However, you still have the issue then of Assassination-SS is an Arena Spec, and Combat-SS is just some delusional hybrid that fails at everything.<br>
<br>
At this point I still feel very confident that Combat &gt; Tri-Spec &gt; Combat SS &gt; Assassination SS, and I have yet to see any real additional utility on the runs (other then the fun of SS'ing and killing a Scout) that would lead me to want to spec it for anything other then Arenas.</div>

</div>Maybe this belongs in the DPS Spreadsheet thread, but you skirted pretty close to something that's been puzzling me a bit when you called unimproved SnD a PITA (which I totally agree with). <br>
<br>
Just for gits 'n shiggles, I was playing around with the Assn/SS spec with some Season 1 weapons just to see how my DPS would change. As expected, it dropped 50-60 DPS (about 7-8%). <br>
<br>
But, what's curious is that the spreadsheet says to run a 5r cycle, which seems to go against the golden rule of being a rogue: Never let SnD drop. Purely speculating, but would this be due to a low hit rating? Serrated Blades making Rupture that much better? Both? <br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I wouldn't jump so far ahead and claim Mace/Sword is on par with Sword/Sword.  I'm still seeing a net decrease from switching to an equivalent Mace in the DPS spreadsheet (which when I looked it over had been calculating Mace spec this way all along).  This was without taking away the 5 talent points (I just added Mace spec, didn't take away from any other talents).<br>

It does seem to put Mace/Sword above Fist/Sword though, but still below Sword/Sword even without accounting for the 5 extra Talent points Sword/Sword gets.</div>

Using your spreadsheet with the default T6 gear uploaded in it I switch from S3 Mace in the MH to S3 Sword in the MH and put 4 points in Vile poisons, I get a 0.88 loss in DPS, which puts it on par if not slightly better. (buffed DPS)<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I fail to see how even a multiplicative damage modifier which only applies to crits (~40% of your attacks) is potentially anywhere close to having a fast OH sword proc slow MH attacks which aren't affected by dual-wield penalty.<br>

Sure, this will potentially boost Mace spec closer to Fist spec, but it won't come near Sword spec.<br>

What's the difference between Sword/Sword and Mace/Sword?<br>
First, we have 5 talent points in favor of Sword/Sword.<br>
<br>
Let's look at damage:<br>
Mace/Sword loses 5% extra MH attacks that proc MH attacks.<br>
But gains 5% extra damage on all crits (that is multiplied by all crit multipliers) and also includes specials.  <br>
<br>
It might be possible especially with the high crit rates at top itemization.  I was using an old version of the spreadsheet that showed a decline.  Current version looks to agree with what you've said.  Be interesting to see how this looks on the Gear sheet with those changes.</div>

		<div id="post_message_662841">Sorry, brain turned off on me for a second and I was thinking Mace/Mace, not Mace/Sword.  Yes, Mace/Sword would certainly draw closer to Sword/Sword.  The real difference lies in:<br>
<br>
For white attacks, an extra attack is better than extra dmg on crits.  In fact, until you have a good 60%+ crit, the extra 5% crit from Fists is more valuable than 5% more dmg on crits.<br>
<br>
For yellow attacks, extra dmg on crits vs extra crit chance will have some point at which they become equal.  At lower crit rates, Fists will be better.  At higher crit rates, Maces will be better.  An extra attack proc from a Sinister Strike will generally be worth less than extra damage on Sinister Strike (either via higher crit chance or higher dmg on crits).<br>
<br>
These principals will remain true <i>within any feasible level of gearing</i> in a raid environment.  Determining which spec is better for you will be largely affected by the itemization you have available to you and your overall hit and crit rates.</div>

</div>Ya executioner main hand.   But, the info about when executioner is better is outdated.   Mongoose almost always better.  Might be able to squeeze out a few dps more with executioner under the right conditions and high gear levels, but mongoose wins out all other times.<br>
<br>
Check a spreadsheet.   Though I doubt wearing gear just for the sake of hit rather than dps stats will benefit.   Cloak of Fiends is generally better I believe, but not by much.<br>

</div>With tons of haste you run into energy cap out problems too as combat because lets say during bloodlust you procced potency 5 times in a row. I cap out alot now because of Rod of the sun king, potency and relentless proccing all at once. With my gear level the AEP calculations show haste as .94 with combat AND hemo raid specs.<br>

Fully debuffed, with T6 and Serrated blades, I'm penetrating 6050 armor. (that includes executioner/wsc/madness averages based on the RogueDPS spreadsheet). 6200 armor is the lowest armor mob you'll see in BT/Hyjal with most bosses being 7685. Hardly pushing it to 0, but close.<br>

I'm not disagreeing with that, but it happens alot. I'm combat mace/sword right now but I guess I was a luckier Hemo rogue than I am as a combat rogue.<br>
<br>
For hemo specs, it could occur that you proc all three, but how often do rogues have all three? I do but I'm only one guy and I consider myself lucky to have them. But let's say I upgraded to a DST and Shard of Contempt or Blackened Naaru sliver next patch, doesn't seem like it would be possible to cap out armor pen then.<br>
<br>
I just hate when people make general statements like, "with full T6 and hemo you're going to be at max armor pen and most likely wasting it". Full T6 doesn't mean anything except a couple hundred passive armor pen. The only way to hit the armor pen cap now is with a fully debuffed mob with all three of those procs going at once on a typical BT boss. A portion might get wasted sure, but how many other unavoidable things can happen that get wasted?<br>
<br>
Edit: Actually you got me thinking about hemo v/s combat and I re-looked at the WWS from last week to this week. If you're interested I'll post them. It'll show you that my white attack damage was far superior compared to being combat. Using the same gear, and no other buff differences on at least 5-6 fights in BT/Hyjal. If my white attacks do so much more damage(~100 more on average hits), then why exactly is combat better than hemo? You say mathematically it's impossible, but for some reason I put out alot more white damage as Hemo with this gear. To the point that the additional rupture damage on top of other hemo spec benefits could possibly be better.</div>

		<div id="post_message_663122">I'm going to say this from the DPS Spreadsheet perspective.  Stacked Armor Pen procs is very high on the "to do" list as it's now all too possible to hit 0 armor on a boss.  Assuming I don't run into the same problems I had with Windfury (where part of the spreadsheet revolted against me changing some things), I'm hoping to have to new, probability driven, Armor Pen proc model up with the next release.  I've worked through a good way to do this, by building a probability table with all proccable armor pen effects and using basic actuarial theory (i.e. Bayes Theorum) to "average" the effects.  By doing so, I can account for "overprocs" where the armor pen is greater than remaining armor.  As an aside, I plan to do the same for Expertise as there are procs in the new patch that can bring dodge to 0.<br>
<br>
In both cases, averages that bring one very close to 0 are going to overstate the effect.  If all your procs happened to go off at once and it's enough to drop the mob below 0 armor, averages will be overstating the result to some degree (more so, the closer you get your average to 0 armor).<br>
<br>
Normally, averages work well in the spreadsheet for proc effects.  This is not the case for Armor Pen and Expertise (when the combination can take one past the cap), so I would use results while realizing there is going to be a degree of unrealized armor pen potential.<br>
<br>
--------------<br>
<br>
As to the two-roll system for special (yellow) attacks, it's pretty simple really.<br>
First roll, does it hit, dodge, miss?<br>
Second roll, does it crit?<br>
<br>
Here's an example (maybe not so real-life) that shows why this matters.<br>
Let's say your special attack can miss or be dodged 10% of the time and you have a 50% chance to crit.<br>
<br>
If it were a one-roll system, you would miss/dodge 10%; hit 40%; crit 50%.<br>
<br>
With a two-roll system, you get miss/dodge 10%; hit 90%<br>
Check for crit 50% of that 90% is a crit, so overall you miss/dodge 10%; hit 45%; crit 45%<br>
<br>
This is why most people's special attack crit % doesn't match the tooltip.</div>

		<div id="post_message_663147">Regarding armor procs:<br>
<br>
Currently, the Gear sheet models Executioner and WSC as procs, but Madness of the Betrayer as an average.  However, the benefit of Madness is small enough that the linear approximation is adequate so long as you don't cap out; and given that it's pretty hard to cap out without using both Executioner and WSC, and very few people use both WSC and MotB, I decided that wasn't a major issue.<br>
<br>
It is quite possible at current itemization levels to cap out on 6200 armor bosses; Sunders + FF + CoR + WSC + Executioner is 5850 armor reduction, meaning only 350 is necessary to reduce a mob to zero - which all Hemo rogues and most T6 rogues are going to have.  The interesting part of this is that capping out isn't really fundamentally a bad thing.  While it's true that during the 10% of the time when both procs are up you're not getting full benefit, it's also true that the 90% of the time when they're not both up they're more powerful than they would be were you not capping out. <br>
<br>
Of course, even given this, Executioner does not generally seem to be worth using, and I don't expect WSC to last very long once 2.4 loot comes out, which brings us back into the territory where nothing is capped.  But, for the moment, capping *can* happen but it's not totally a bad thing.</div>

Specifically compare fights from 2/19/08 and 2/26/08 as I had the same gear setup and same group buffs. Notice how much higher my white damage is as hemo.<br>

If I'm doing something wrong as combat, I'd like to know, but from the looks of it with my gear setup, hemo outperformed combat.<br>

<br>

<br>
Buffed with Might/Kings/MOTW/Spicy Hot Talbuk/SoE/Battle Shout (with Solarian trinket), using Windfury.<br>
Debuffs on the boss were Mangle/CoR/FF/Sunders/Blood Frenzy.<br>
<br>
We had no enhancement shaman in the raid. The build used is the one I have right now - standard 19/42/0 with 3/5 vile.<br>
A couple of gear changes from my current armory, I did not have DST until last Sunday; I was using Swiftstrike Bracers, as Insidious Bands dropped that very same kill. Also I didn't have +4 stats. I was using Tsunami Talisman + Ashtongue.<br>
<br>
I also didn't have Cloak of Fiends - I was probably still using Drape of the Dark Reavers.<br>
<br>
The sheets point at ~1823.26 DPS (set to 'caster boss' armor settings, which Teron is included in), I'm using version 2.4.0.4a.<br>
<br>
My output for that kill was <i>1819</i> DPS. The accuracy of the sheets is amazing.<br>
<br>
We're on similar gear levels I reckon. We have approximately the same percentage outgoing damage per skill (SS, Rupture, whatever).<br>
<br>
I only noticed a pair of things whilst skimming through this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080306025047/http://www.en-raptured.com/wws/2008-02-26_Gorefiend/apoq.html" target="_blank">WWS of yours as combat on Teron.</a><br>
<br>
A) Your crit rate on both melee and specials is dysmal for some reason, for both melee and specials (24/16%), but this could be a parser related thing. In comparision I'm getting 38/35%. Partly it can probably be accounted to using Executioner rather than Mongoose, but still it's a 10%+ difference.<br>
<br>
B) Your miss rate seems a bit high, 14/11% miss -- but I'm assuming this is including dodge given that 11% miss on specials makes no sense whatsoever, especially given the miss rate for specials is 9% and you're way over that (320~ hit rating from what I see on your profile), so I think it's safe to assume you got ~5% miss in reality. Still 11% dodge on a boss seems a bit too high, I think the number thrown around is 6.5-9% dodge and it makes no sense considering you have at least 10 expertise. I don't know what's up with that.<br>
<br>
Note also that average melee hits are higher for you as you got a 100 DPS innate 2.7 speed weapon versus my Talon and a truckload of armor ignore procs. But otherwise everything in terms of scaling seems identical.<br>
<br>
The only explanation I can think of explaning the ~200 dps difference between us (assuming the same play style) is that obscure lack of crit you have there along with that high 'failure to hit' (I wouldn't call it 'miss') rate. Why those were there, I don't know. The 2/5 tier 4 wouldn't help, but it surely wouldn't account for such a level of difference. Any ideas?</div>

</div>The DPS number isn't really the point I'm trying to make. Look at the average white hit for hemo v/s white hit for combat.<br>
<br>
The abnormal miss rate was a client/server lag I was told, behind him enough to garrote, but close enough to him from behind to get parries. 44 parries on that particular fight.<br>
<br>
But again, not really the main point. I do 100 more damage on white hits for 150 landed and my white crits were on average 50 more too. Then add double the rupture damage.</div>

</div> Well yes, of course, if we're talking about Shadowstep and not 11/28/22 then I'd say that's easily predictable. 560 armor ignore on top of whatever your gear has, 1.10 * AP from yourself and any buff, ~ 1.39 * your Agility in attack power raid buffed, ridiculously scaling your AP, of course white main-hand damage will go through the roof. All combat gets is 1.02 * Agility. I just don't see where you're going with this. <br>
<br>
I was just pointing out you also don't seem to be doing as well as combat as you should - at least on that fight - given you're stating you do better as hemo often. I could be wrong, since this may be raid buff related, but I'm just pointing out you should be doing higher as combat rather than on par, if not worse. I just tried to come up with an explanation as to why you would be doing as good as hemo.<br>
<br>
But yes, of course in practise sheets can't compare the two unless it's sustained damage.<br>
<br>
EDIT: I don't mean to come off as rude, mind you. I'm just trying to understand what's the whole point of the discussion. Also in regards to being simultaneously in front/behind - aside from when the mobs turn to cast something (like Teron and his mark), I think you can avoid the situation by sitting at max melee range.</div>

</div>The 560 armor penn. from Serrated Blades is what causes this difference (as well as the AP boost if you run 11/21/29). The question I have is this: did you get more white damage <i>overall</i> than combat, or just more <i>per hit</i>? More per hit makes sense, as with a Hemo spec your white hits will hit harder. For 11/28/22, there should be approximately the same number of white hits for a Hemo build and a Combat Swords build, as both will have Sword Spec. Thus, CSwords vs. 11/28/22, I expect Hemo to exhibit more white and Combat more yellow. For 11/21/29 Hemo, you lose a bunch of white hits from sword spec, and therefore CSwords should have more white hits, and perhaps a little more white damage, overall.<br>
<br>
Almost all combat talents in the bottom end of the tree (AR, Aggression, Combat Potency, Surprise Attacks) increase only yellow damage. In addition, CSwords gets Lethality and poison talents where Hemo doesn't. 11/28/22 Hemo picks up all the same white damage boosters, though, plus Serrated Blades. And let's not forget the Hemo debuff itself! It makes sense that white damage is going to be higher with Hemo+Swords, but you lose a good bit of yellow in the process.</div>

				I just hate when people make general statements like, "with full T6 and hemo you're going to be at max armor pen and most likely wasting it". Full T6 doesn't mean anything except a couple hundred passive armor pen. The only way to hit the armor pen cap now is with a fully debuffed mob with all three of those procs going at once on a typical BT boss. A portion might get wasted sure, but how many other unavoidable things can happen that get wasted?

				Edit: Actually you got me thinking about hemo v/s combat and I re-looked at the WWS from last week to this week. If you're interested I'll post them. It'll show you that my white attack damage was far superior compared to being combat. Using the same gear, and no other buff differences on at least 5-6 fights in BT/Hyjal. If my white attacks do so much more damage(~100 more on average hits), then why exactly is combat better than hemo? You say mathematically it's impossible, but for some reason I put out alot more white damage as Hemo with this gear. To the point that the additional rupture damage on top of other hemo spec benefits could possibly be better.
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</div>For Tri-Spec that makes sense, you still have the same set bonuses, you don't attack any faster with Combat (except during BF), and you have Duel-Wield and Precision, so the only difference for white damage is you now have more AP (Assuming you picked up Deadliness) and Serrated Blades, so yes, your auto-attacks are going to hit for a good bit more, and I had the same experience where my white damage was higher, and it was a higher percentage of my total damage.<br>
<br>
Regarding Hemo, I seem to remember getting more damage per tick, but less ticks due to longer cycles.  Basically Combat is better due to the controlled burst, you do more yellow damage with Combat, you can chain cooldowns, and generally your DPS will be higher.<br>
<br>
The best comparison I can find is Kaz'rogal because of lack of variability:<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080306025047/http://www.en-raptured.com/wws/2008-02-26_Kazrogal/apoq.html" target="_blank">WWS</a><br>
http://www.en-raptured.com/wws/archive/2008-02/2008-02-19_Kaz'rogal/apoq.html<br>
<br>
You do slightly more DPS as Combat, but it might help if you can pull 2 fights that you feel are very similar, but generally on a tank and spank fight, Tri-Spec (especially Mace/Sword) will come very close 1-2% of Combat (Mace/Sword), to the point where the RNG will have a larger effect then your spec.  The lack of burst/chaining potential is where you can fall behind Combat, especially on fights where you aren't in combat the entire time.<br>

</div>White hits will be for more for the reason I explained above, as will your total white damage because BF is less of a gain for white damage then Serrated Blades and the additional AP from Deadliness.  As for Rupture, I would imagine it ticks for a decent amount more, but you should be seeing less total ticks, and you shouldn't be seeing anywhere close to 100% more, maybe 50% more, but that is a stretch... and that is 50% more on 5% of your damage.<br>

</div>I might suggest that you provide evidence to support such claims, as conventional wisdom and at least the Gear spreadsheet (I can't swear to the DPS sheet) have Infamy &gt; Talon.  Yes, Infamy is somewhat poorly itemized relative to Talon, but it's higher ilvl so has a larger stat budget and a higher base damage; this advantage is eroded by it's poor itemization, but it still scores 10-20 AP ahead of Talon for most rogues.</div>

We are low on raiding shamans and typically rely on poisons; I've always used Deadly Mainhand, Instant Offhand in the (perhaps mistaken) belief that the faster attack speed of my offhand will generate more poison applications. Does factoring in the extra hits of Sinister Strike/Sword Specialisation outweigh the faster speed? Windfury being unavailable, is it worth applying Instant to the mainhand instead?<br>

If so, at what point in the discrepancy between mainhand-offhand speeds are you more likely to achieve a higher rate of Instant procs with the offhand?</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I have a question about this write-up.<br>
<br>
Am I wrong in thinking this is geared more towards a Rogue that is on a raid? What I mean is, alot of the descriptions of ability cycles, etc refer to using Rupture over Evis.<br>
<br>
When PvE'ing, solo, regular World Mobs... Is Rupture still better than Evis? Considering how long they live, would Rupture really do all that greater DPS than Evis?<br>
<br>
I'm just a little confused.</div>

</div>Yes, this guide is for DPS as a <i>raiding </i>rogue. Solo content is different, due to mobs dieing faster, the need to itemize to not only DPS but also stay alive, the fact that you are either attacking from the front or employing crowd control, and the fact that you won't have buffs. In other words, it's a different ball game.<br>
<br>
However, most of the posters here are far past worrying about solo play.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I have a question about calculating an EP value of Band of the Eternal Champion.  My question is how to calculate EP on the chance to Increase AP by 160.  Assuming a CD of hidden cd of ability of 1 minute (not sure about this) and that CD starts counting down upon proc.  I have EP for that calculation as 160 * 10sec/60 sec = 26.67 avg EP<br>
<br>
So Far, I've used the EP values you litsted in t6 quality sword spec<br>
<br>
Band of Eternal Champion<br>
29 Agi= 29*1.9*1.1=60.61 EP<br>
43 Stam= 0 EP<br>
+60 AP= 60 EP<br>
Chance on hit increase AP by 160 for 10 Sec=160 * 10/60 =  26.67<br>
<br>
The EP total I calculated is 147.28, assuming 1 minute hidden CD on proc.  Do you all agree?</div>

	</table>
</div>Nope.<br>
<br>
The cooldown is 60 seconds, but it doesn't necessarily proc the instant the cooldown is up; you have to factor in the expected time to proc after the cooldown is up to get the right answer.<br>
<br>
I believe for most rogues the actual benefit of the proc is closer to 20 AP; for additional details, consult your favorite spreadsheet.</div>

		<div id="post_message_664824">I currently have the two S2 arena swords, and my guild is just finishing up with SSC/TK.  Morogrim has not been kind to me, but I did just pick up Talon of the Phoenix from Al'ar.  Since I am going to respec to Fist/Swords until I can get my hands on a Blade of Infamy, I figured I would also take the opportunity to respec out of Murder, since I am about to head to MH/BT almost exclusively.<br>
<br>
I know I remember a significant discussion about Murder, but since I can't figured out how to get the EJ search to direct me to a specific post in 50+ page threads (I think the discussion was in either Rogue Gear or Roguecraft 101), I haven't been able to track it down exactly.  Using google I did find a few discussions about Murder, but they were largely dealing with dagger builds and whether to take Murder or Ruthlessness or Lethality.<br>
<br>
So, here are my questions, none of which are answered on page 1 as far as I can tell, and none of which are just "check the spreadsheet" questions (since the spreadsheets don't model the percentage of mobs murder actually works for).  While I do do weekly arena, it is purely for raid gear, so I am interested only in full on max raid spec:<br>
<br>
1- Am I just being a moron, and is there a way to link to the specific posts containing your search terms from the EJ search/advanced search?<br>
<br>
2- Page 1 lists two sample builds, one for CSwords, and one for Fist/Sword.  Both include 2 points in murder.  Assuming one were about to head into MH/BT, would a modification be recommended?  If so, I can't figure out exactly what the tradeoff would be into.  All the threads I found talked about Ruthlessness or Lethality, but I already have those maxed out (my proposed build here: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080308232916/http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=fbe0oxZMIV0bVzEMGot" target="_blank">http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=fbe0oxZMIV0bVzEMGot</a> ).  As far as I can tell, my only other option is to stick them into Imp. Evis.  Is that really the only other choice, and if so is it really worth it, even in MH/BT?<br>
<br>
3- While I'm here, perhaps someone can explain to me why Imp. Gouge is in these sample builds.  Does it have some PvE utility I am not aware of, or is it just a filler PvP talent?  I pull aggro infrequently, but when I do I'd rather have the 3% extra dodge, frankly.<br>
<br>
4- Similar question for Nerves of Steel.  I remember being trained long ago that you don't want to be the only guy not feared by a boss, but nowadays the tank is rarely ever feared in my experience.  Does this ability and its increase to time on target outweigh the last 2 points in Lethality?<br>
<br>
5- Should this info be helpful for anyone else moving from T5 to T6 content, perhaps I might suggest a small paragraph re: murder on the first page post.</div>

		<div id="post_message_664854">Combat builds take Murder since there's really nothing else.  You'll be eviscerating even less often than you're benefiting from Murder, and it's a smaller damage increase - hence, just take Murder.<br>
<br>
Imp Gouge is because some people like it as filler over Lightning Reflexes, as it's marginally more useful for farming and PvP.  I personally prefer the dodge from Lightning Reflexes, but as neither is a DPS talent there's really no wrong answer.<br>
<br>
Nerves of Steel is a perfectly good talent, although it doesn't really come up very often (Archimonde and Kaz'rogal are the only places that come to mind)... but again, it's not a damage talent, so there's little reason to swap out for it; as hybrid sword/fist, there's not a lot of room in the talent build to get it.  As straight swords you can put one point in it, but the merit of that one point versus, say, Endurance can be debated.</div>

		<div id="post_message_664866">1 - You can search by Thread or search by Post.  Not sure if thats exactly what you were looking for, but possibly.<br>
<br>
2 - Your alternatives to Murder are as follows:<br>
-Imp Evis (used 0 to 2 times per fight and sometimes on trash), 10% increase to ~1% of your dmg<br>
-Remorseless Attacks (useful only on bosses where you get the killing blow on some add), essentially useless<br>
-Imp Backstab (considering you don't wield a dagger...), useless<br>
-Murder (only effective on Najentus, Bloodboil and.. Council?), 2% increase on 3 of 14 bosses<br>
<br>
None of these are really all that useful, I'd pick Murder since it is a bigger increase in dps overall even in BT/Hyjal and gets the added benefit of having a higher "uptime" in other instances.<br>
<br>
3 - Purely a utility thing.  I get the dodge myself as I can't remember the last time I gouged while raiding.  Well, maybe gouge to interrupt a cast if Kick and Kidney were on CD.. but then I'm just gouging for an interrupt, not for the duration.<br>
<br>
4 - Nothing *wrong* with nerves of steel, in that it will no longer risk you getting gibbed.  Bosses will now follow a tank even if the tank is feared.  This happened right around the patch where alliance lost perma-fear-ward.  Not that a tank wants to be attacked (from behind) while feared.. but at least the boss isn't on you.<br>
<br>
That said, its really only useful on maybe 2-3 fights.  Leathality is a superior choice.<br>
<br>
5 - Up to Vulajin..<br>

Right now I use S1 swords, and I'm trying to figure out if the fist weapon is an improvement over S2 Sword and the S3 sword.  I have a basic understanding of Excel, but I can't figure out how to add a weapon's data to the spreadsheet.  Is there a more recent version of the sheet that is updated for the new 2.4 Badge loot?  Or a way to input the new gear myself?  Right now I have version 0.9.4.  Thanks<br>
<br>
Edit:  Nevermind!  I found version 0.9.5 (beta).   As a suggestion, there should be a link to download that workbook on the main thread of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080308232916/http://elitistjerks.com/f31/t11882-rogue_gear_spreadsheet/" target="_blank">Rogue Gear Spreadsheet</a></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">White hits will be for more for the reason I explained above, as will your total white damage because BF is less of a gain for white damage then Serrated Blades and the additional AP from Deadliness.  As for Rupture, I would imagine it ticks for a decent amount more, but you should be seeing less total ticks, and you shouldn't be seeing anywhere close to 100% more, maybe 50% more, but that is a stretch... and that is 50% more on 5% of your damage.</div>

</div>I'm 11/21/29 with blade flurry in that hemo WWS. The point I was trying to make was, if 65% of my damage is white attacks, and I do 80-100 more on average per attack, on top of more rupture damage, why is it that the spreadsheets show hemo as being 100-120 dps less than combat?<br>
<br>
I know there's a checkbox in the rogue DPS spreadsheet for hemo debuff estimate, but isn't that adding all the charges(total raid damage added) into it?<br>
<br>
Look at the WWS, I have maybe 10-15k more SS damage per fight than I do Hemo damage, but my white attacks and total rupture damage more than make up for it.<br>
<br>
As far as Mace/Sword spec, it's on par with sword/sword spec and largely based on itemization. Already stated earlier in this thread...<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Well, let's look at this...<br>
What's the difference between Sword/Sword and Mace/Sword?<br>
First, we have 5 talent points in favor of Sword/Sword.<br>
<br>
Let's look at damage:<br>
Mace/Sword loses 5% extra MH attacks that proc MH attacks.<br>
But gains 5% extra damage on all crits (that is multiplied by all crit multipliers) and also includes specials.  <br>
<br>
It might be possible especially with the high crit rates at top itemization.  I was using an old version of the spreadsheet that showed a decline.  Current version looks to agree with what you've said.  Be interesting to see how this looks on the Gear sheet with those changes.</div>

</div>I looked at several fights. Honestly, it's a bit hard to compare them because you seem to have had slightly faster kills on the raid you were combat spec, so I can't look easily at overall damage. You are definitely hitting harder as Hemo, due to the armor ignore. Your sinister strike crits are hitting harder than hemo crits, due to Lethality. Oddly, hemo and ss hits are really about the same. You are dealing more rupture damage per tick with hemo (as expected), but I feel like you are getting a few more ticks in per unit time with combat. You also seem to get more SSs in per unit time than hemos, again as expected.<br>
<br>
Take a look at the following comparisons, for example...<br>
<br>
<b>Kazrogal</b><br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080308232916/http://www.en-raptured.com/wws/2008-02-26_Kazrogal/apoq.html" target="_blank">Combat WWS</a> vs. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080308232916/http://en-raptured.com/wws/archive/2008-02/2008-02-05_Kaz'rogal/apoq.html" target="_blank">Hemo WWS</a><br>
<br>
<b>Najentus</b><br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080308232916/http://www.en-raptured.com/wws/2008-02-26_Naj'entus/apoq.html" target="_blank">Combat WWS</a> vs. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080308232916/http://en-raptured.com/wws/archive/2008-02/2008-02-05_Naj'entus/apoq.html" target="_blank">Hemo WWS</a><br>
<br>
On Najentus, as combat you get 67 Rupture ticks over 3.86 minutes, or 17 ticks per minute. As hemo you get 77 Rupture ticks over 4.77 minutes, or 16 ticks per minute. Overall, it's advantage hemo, though, since you get 1/3 more rupture damage. However, on Kazrogal, in 2.71 minutes you get 47 Rupture ticks (17 per minute) as combat; but got in an extra rupture as Hemo for 56 ticks over 2.81 minutes (~20 per minute). Luck of timing, I guess.<br>
<br>
On both fights you get significantly more instants per unit time as combat, and your instant crits hit harder. I really think that makes up the differences in white DPS and rupture damage.<br>
<br>
I would have looked at Gorefiend too, except you had that weird parry problem. But all in all you are recorded as ~100 DPS down in the Hemo spec, even in top-end gear. That's about 6-7% down from combat, which is where the spreadsheet would put you. Seems reasonable to me.</div>

</div>Yep, in the general case, he's flat-out wrong.<br>
<br>
IIRC, Instant Poison &gt; the stone in the case where you have a poisonable mob and no WF. The only time you want to use stones is on unpoisonable mobs, and only on the OH, unless you have no WF in which case do the MH too.</div>

		<div id="post_message_666445">Quick question about gemming, I scanned through the pages of this thread and didn't see this question asked, forgive me if I missed it but I am a bit tired.<br>
<br>
So, everyone says that 8Agi &gt; 16AP but nobody can tell me why. Is the small amount of crit gained from an 8agi gem worth the loss of 8ap? Is dodge weighed into this at all? I'm sure Kings buff plays some role but I still don't see the benefit.<br>
<br>
Basically looking for a mathematically inclined person to show me the numbers of why 8Agi &gt; 16AP.</div>

		<div id="post_message_666457">The numbers are in the spreadsheets; refer to either for details.  In terms of a short version: kings does indeed play a large role; for a raid-buffed rogue without kings, they tend to be pretty close in raw damage output; with Kings, 8 agi is thus ~10% ahead.  This is due to the .2% crit granted by an 8 agi gem, which, assuming a reasonable weapon damage and AP, surpasses the damage done by 8 AP.  The dodge is not generally factored into that calculation other than to say "it does equal or superior damage, and *also* gives dodge - why wouldn't you use it?"</div>

		<div id="post_message_666458">Consult your local spreadsheet for EAP values, and you'll find that in a majority of cases, 1.1 agility is worth more than 2 attack power.   So yes, this often carries the 'with kings' modifier, but in either the DPS sheet or the Gear sheet, you can turn off Blessing of Kings to compare numbers as well.</div>
