		<div id="post_message_308306"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->There seems to be no topic for Magtheridon encounter at the moment.<br>
<br>
- The Magtheridon encounter has been rebalanced to be somewhat easier and should now better keep to proper raid progression. <br>
<br>
This gives no info what they did actually change. Did anyone go there yesterday after the hotfix, and could give some details?<br>
<br>
We spent 3 full raids last reset learning the encounter, and we managed to reach the situation where we need to start clicking the portals to prevent the fire damage while still finishing the last adds (1-2 alive). So I can't really comment the difficulty of the later part of the fight, but for me it seemed that the difficulty comes from the p1 and from the fact that you need 20 guys + MT alive if you want to keep the rotation working.<br>
<br>
For us the hard part was keeping the tanks alive while we get the knockback from Magtheridon in the end of p1, so tuning down the add damage or hp might help a lot. Also the infernals should be tuned down a bit, I would not like to even go there without 4 warlocks. And even with 4, they seemed always manage to kill few players and most wipes were caused by them (free infernal during knockback will almost everytime kill somebody). Good tuning might also be a reduced cooldown on using the portals, maybe only 15 people required to do it would give some room for errors.<br>
<br>
Anyways, we are going back there tonight.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_308307"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->from my point of view, the only thing that might be balanced is the cast time in the adds heal spell, dmg of the shadowbolt nova and the adds hp. anything beyond that would make it onyxia style, too easy, because as you already said, p2 is all about in-time clicking on the cubes and not messing up rotations. sadly we downed magtheridon as usual on wednesday evening on our eu-server so i cant give more info, as the encounter was still the old one at that time.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_308322"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I didn't get exact numbers from mobhealth yet, but pre-hotfix tonight they had about 350k health each.  We were struggling to get 2 down before the 2m timer.  Post hotfix we could down 3 with relative ease (although we did brind 2 extra dps after some healers left).  The adds definately have much less hp, I would guess around 230k given what I saw.  Mag himself hit me for 5-6k post hotfix, as opposed to whatever meaningless damage he did before.  That appears to be all that changed.  I presume a potted and geared guild could down all 5 adds before the 2m timer now if they tried.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I think they took the nerf in the right direction personally. I'm happy with encounters that require excellent individual play, as long as we're not running our heads against the wall due to numbers. Having to bring X people of Y class with Z consumables to do the add phase properly got old fast, but if we can go in with a weird setup and have our biggest issue be the cubes, that's great.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I really do hope you see the problem with that. You really cant have Naxx level encounters as the first linear 25 man instances (eg. not 1-2 bosses, done at saturday night when bored aka Onyxia) in a game.<br>
<br>
With the rate at which they are pushing out content now, this content should by all means be fairly accsessible for average raiding guilds and very doable for the seriously hardcore which need the gear to be able to make a dent on the Black Temple.<br>
<br>
All things beeing equal (which we know they arent but anyway), Black temple should be the new aq40 and Hyjal should probably be Naxx.<br>
<br>
Casual raiding guilds should in due time be able to poke their heads into Black Temple while having SSC and The Eye on farm. Then again I might very well be very wrong but it really seems unlikely that they'll have no less then 4 dungeons like Naxx that is effectivly unavailable to the vast majority of the playerbase. It doesn't seem to fit with the whole "TBC makes casual beeing easier" and "its easier to get 25 people together then 40" philosophy.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">While they both are entry-level, do remember that the bosses that dropped t1, t2, t3 chests were harder than the bosses that dropped the legs on down. While they are in the same tier, keep in mind that there will be a progression of difficulty within that tier. As such, it makes sense that Mag is harder than Curator, Prince, Maulgar, and Gruul.</div>

</div>This is very correct and a very good point. It's also tied in with the relative ilevel and slotmods as certain pieces are "worth" more then others (eg. head vs bracers) but this is something you all know on this forum I suppose <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080612112536im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/wink.gif" border="0" alt="" title=";)" class="inlineimg">.<br>

However, there should be a relative difference in how hard they are within the same tier, it should be like blackberries and blueberries, not apples and airplanes. So to speak.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

We previously downed 2 adds before Mag would release, and now we can get 4 (unpotted).  Their hp was nerfed big time.  Same with the trash leading up to Mag....they all had a significant reduction in HP (damage stays same on trash).<br>

As far as damage from Mag's adds, i believe it was hitting for the same amount.  We were getting 3-4k shadowbolt volley's by the 4th add, however I don't remember if this was similar to pre-nerf.<br>

		<div id="post_message_308492"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I'm not really sure I agree that anything should be much harder then Naxx. The zone required some massive consumable use which more or less everyone agrees is a bad thing.<br>
<br>
Presuming this is done away with somehow, the trickyness of an encounter has a fairly limited scope allthough we did see some good stuff in Naxx (mostly videos for me but hey) and I'm guessing there's still a few more gimmics, good or bad, the developers can come up with.<br>
<br>
I totally agree that things need to be progressivly harder, thats bascially what I'm advocating as well <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080612112536im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":)" class="inlineimg">. But what's basically most guilds need to have a fighting chance on the first encounters available.<br>
<br>
And tier4 is not really a contiunation of tier3, compared the the various monkeysuits (eg. blue gear) tier4 is the new tier1. And as such, tier4 needs to be accessible for normal raiding guilds so they can continue their progress. Their progress should be slower and probably stagnate at the Naxx level encounters which really do require some effort, but up to that these guilds need a chance. Simply because the vast majority of the playerbase that raids will fit into this category.<br>
<br>
You are somewhat self contradicting though, you're saying that the normal guilds will have their hands full in SSC and the eye, this is true and what I'm expecting as well. On the other hand you say it should be Naxx difficulty and that will exclude the content.<br>
<br>
Basically, you dont expect a well tuned Naxx to drop MC loot and you dont expect a well tuned Naxx to be doable in blues. The first level of 25 man raiding needs to be accessible (not easymode, accessible). If nothing else, simply to provide the major raiding playerbase something to do.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>You get equal or better loot (to compare to what you could get at the time in MC//BWL//AQ) for less work. Is that something thats terribly wrong for the average or below average guild? Dont forget, the faster you gear the faster you can progress on SSC and The Eye. Would you rather work through progression a-la Naxx for what is (imo) Teir 2? I prolly should of added Kara into the grouping also, as it has tier 4 in it.<br>

</div>Well, we could get into stereotypes, but that's not terribly productive.  They're not very accurate and are pretty much formed 90% by people on the official forums, which are the biggest waste of time possible.  Casual stereotype:  I want to play 5 hours a week and have full Tier 3.  Hardcore stereotype:  You shouldn't even bother playing if you can't raid 5hrs a night 6 nights a week.<br>
<br>
Very few people actually feel that way.  I believe the <i>actual</i> casual viewpoint is essentially "There are a massive number of raid zones in-game right now (relative to the majority of the life of WoW).  It makes sense that a healthy portion of those raid zones are somewhat accessible by average guilds, since there is still plenty of content left for hardcore folks."<br>
<br>
Of course, above average guilds want a real challenge, and they should be able to get it.  Casual guilds (which I personally, do not define as having multiple bosses down in Naxx) should also have access to raid encounters.  Where to put the line between "challenging" and "accessible" is pretty unclear.  I personally think that dumbing down encounters over time is a decent idea, if done deliberately.  Not overtuned/bugged and then nerfed, just harder for bleeding edge, and then progressively easier as the more skilled guilds have little use to be there.<br>
<br>
This comes from a casual viewpoint so take it with a grain of salt.  I am only able to play 4-5 hrs a week, 12-18 hrs every other weekend these days, so I don't expect to see mid to high end raiding for a very long time (if ever), but that's just fine.  With my playtime and guild structure, I'll have to (and probably will be) content with Kara and heroics and the eventual 25-man Ony-esque PuGs.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

As an off the cuff average, adding up RPI (which for not all values is equal, but is essentially one point, one kill), dividing by the number of Alliiance guilds (sample sizes, people, sample sizes), the result is ~25. Two guilds at 25 have killed Fankriss and Nefarian.<br>

</div>Most casual guilds put in a lot of effort.  Almost every guild on our server puts in quite a bit more raid time than we do, and yet they are behind us in progress.  Surely, those lower life forms must be punished for their impudence.  Surely there are not other mitigating factors; surely they don't deserve anything.  They just want to get free loots!  <br>

Anyway, the flaw in this argument has allready been pointed out by others.<br>
<br>
For me it sums up like this;<br>
<br>
* Blizzard is making the game to make money<br>
* Blizzard will tune the content in such a way that they'll keep making money<br>
* 1% of the playerbase is not where their revenue comes from and thus not who the entry level content will be tuned for in the long run<br>
* 80% of all statistics online are made up on the fly<br>

</div>Like others have said in this thread, Gruul post-hotfix is significantly easier then Magtheridon is now.  Gruul takes almost no coordination now, and doesn't require much dps.  Magtheridon actually had some challenge in killing the adds before, now the only real challenge is getting 20 people to learn to click boxes in rotations.  Still, getting 20 people to click can be a real challenge in itself for most guilds.  If your guild is coordinated you could probably work on him now and see progress, but don't expect a kill if you can't farm nightbane with ease by this point.<br>
<br>
As for his damage, I don't remember what he hit me for before.  I seem to recall it being around 2kish.  He was hitting me last night for 5.2-6k.  A paladin reported 5k cleve pre-hotfix and 13k post (healing gear both times).  Seems like a hell of a lot more then the 40% some people are reporting.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_308626"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I'm sorry for throwing this thread into a Casual V Raider debate, I didnt mean for it to go that far. I guess that my statement that SSC seemed to give off the wrong idea, or I might of just worded it wrong (or I could be an egotystical jackass, which is probably true), and sparked this entire thing. I wont add anything more to the fire, rather, I'll just correct what I said.<br>

I dont think they will nerf SSC because everything that I have personally seen seems very killable by anyone out there, as long as they can organize and put in the time.<br>

</div>I dont know what the exact requirement of gear is, but I would suggest just take 1 night to go in there (Hell, it would be like 50 min of work) and put in an attempt or two. If you can kill 2 - 3 of the channelers before he becomes active, then you should be on the road to killing him. Although your MT's gear could be a stopping block, since I hear that he hits pretty hard now, i.e. Someone vent said our MT got hit for 10k last night, before (monday night) we had a bear tanking him ~.~<br>

		<div id="post_message_308631"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Magtheridon and Hydross are both doable by a guild that has killed Gruul for the first time this week.  Both have different requirements, to wit:<br>
<br>
- Hydross requires you have a lot of good tanks that are properly geared.  This involves a mix of frost resist and nature resist gear, and not stuff from maradon either.  You can use bear tanks (again though, with some frost/nature resist) to tank the adds Hydross spawns periodically.  You need very high DPS.  You need some warlocks for banish.  The trash in SSC is very painful and respawns rapidly.<br>
<br>
- Magtheridon has less of a gear check and more of a skill check.  You will have to create groups of people that have very specific jobs every few minutes (clicking cubes), healers that need to heal these clickers, all the while the ground is earthquaking below you.  Missing the cube clicks will wipe the raid.  Once you click a cube you start taking 800 dmg/sec plus you get a debuff that won't let you click it again for 3 minutes (hence the group rotations).  Its kind of like C'thun stomach on crack.<br>
<br>
I would suggest you should start gearing up a few tanks in frost/nature gear (not really sure what the best source is?  Naxx resist gear or outland frost stuff?  Green nature resist?) while working on Magtheridon, once you have a couple tanks geared up try out Hydros.<br>
<br>
<br>
fwiw SSC will definitely get nerfed when patch 2.1.0 comes out, most likely along the lines of trash respawns/amount, and then the bosses themselves a few weeks/months later.  The formula has been the same since WoW launched as proven this week with Gruuls hotfixes.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

So, sidestepping pointless comparisons to bygone raiding content and arguments over who should get to kill what bosses, I thought I'd come back to the topic.<br>
<br>
Last night the hotfix was applied while we were making attempts, and before the RnD post had been made. One attempt, he was hitting me for around 2k, the very next run abruptly shot up to 6-7k hits and cleaves. We actually thought it was bugged ala Netherspite at first, then came back after we saw the post. The only other observed difference was that the channelers went down more quickly-- they still appeared to hit/cast/getstrongerondeath the same as before. Mag's other spells also seemed to stay the same. Overall noticeably easier, but nowhere near the scale of the gigantic nerf on Gruul-- still relatively challenging (lrn2click, etc).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_308634"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Following the raid progression chart, Mag = Gruul/Kara, whereas SSL/TK are above it, thus you should most likely do Mag right after Gruul, just make sure you read up abit on it first so people know whats going to happen :P<br>
<br>
I personally made our guild wait on Mag till he got nerfed, because spamming flasks on Gruul, and then Hydross was more than enough without adding Mag there too when I knew he would be nerfed later.<br>
So tonight after Gruul goes down we're going to play with Mag instead of going to SSL thanks to this now.<br>
<br>
<br>
I have to give a different story about Hydross though, we've not found him nearly as easy as other guilds seem to be saying he is. We've used full flasks twice, tried 2~3 different tactics (that are known to work) and had a pretty damned optimal setup on the last time we flasked. Still not dead yet and its due to a shortfall of DPS only.<br>
We are an 'above average raiding guild' with a fair mix of pretty 'hardcore' players, we dont have slackers in the raid and the general management of the tactic/raid setup was always pretty good.<br>
Im unable to work out exactly what we are doing which is simply 'wrong' and preventing us a kill, whereas with other bosses thats normally pretty easy to work out.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Mag still seems to require tighter execution by the whole raid, where as Gruul is more of just a gear check for your tanks, and to a lesser degree, DPS.  (although if you DPS is great, you can lower the gear check for your tanks, and vice versa)<br>
<br>
Mag being as difficult as a boss somewhere in SSC sounds right.  The chestpiece is always the centerpiece of any set, you could kill bosses in Naxx before C'Thun, bosses in AQ40 before Nef, and so on.   Plus even if he's the harder of the 2, TK seems to be intended to be after SSC for the most part, so in reality guilds can gear up more in SSC.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

It sounds like they kept all the main elements of the fight in place, but lowered the DPS threshold needed, which is a good change.  Before it was stupid that you needed Hydross-level DPS for the first 2-3 minutes of the fight, and then after that you just kind of crawled at a snail's pace against a giant Pit Lord that hits about as hard as a random melee grunt in a heroic instance.  As I'd mentioned in other threads, I was not thrilled about the fact that we hit a point where we needed to use DPS consumables on learning attempts in order stabilize "phase 2."

Mag still seems to require tighter execution by the whole raid, where as Gruul is more of just a gear check for your tanks, and to a lesser degree, DPS.  (although if you DPS is great, you can lower the gear check for your tanks, and vice versa)</div>

</div>On topic, I thought I had gathered from threads that a significant amount of fire resist was required around the raid for Magtheridon. In the alternative, we presently have no access to Naxx resist gear, so... what's the story here? The three new expansion resist plate items for those two categories (nature and frost) make it look like we're going to be massively timesunk, by means of having to drag blacksmiths to heroics to get enough primal nethers for every tank in the guild.<br>
<br>
Not terrible, except I don't believe we have five blacksmiths, and we aren't running heroics like it sounds most readers here are. I believe I read in the "Everything you want to know about Heroics" or some other thread that Underbog was one of the five that was an optimal combination of easy/quick/badgey, and that did not go well at all. Heroic Crypts has been our pinata, when we actually put together to go Heroic.<br>
<br>
My understanding, originally, was that we'd need a raid of 100 heroic badges (each) to go to Magtheridon (and not gouge our eyes out). ~10 nethers x tanks (that can be gifted) seems a bit more manageable for SSC, although painful in its own right.

</div>I'm not in any kind of uber raiding guild, but I can tell you that I don't do heroics much because I find them obnoxious. Buffing the trash enormously while leaving most of the bosses relatively unchanged is <i>exactly</i> the opposite of what would make heroics enjoyable to do. <br>
<br>
I don't mind buffing the trash slightly, but when Underbog Lords are the most significant challenge in an instance you know something is wrong, especially when, two minutes later, you find that you can just utterly ignore the Black Stalker's heroic ability (adds) and kill him as easily as you did when you ran the place at level 64.<br>
<br>
In fact Underbog is an interesting example, because the pre-Hungarfen trash is the hardest bit of the instance, and Hungarfen is the hardest boss. After that it's like you're in Heroic Lite. The first time we went in there we were very worried about the Naga pulls because we lacked any kind of humanoid CC. Imagine our surprise when we found out they hardly hit any harder than they do on Normal.<br>
<br>
Heroics are just badly implemented at the moment, in my opinion. Tone down the trash, buff the bosses, give them meaningful new abilities. Then they might be more fun.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

In fact Underbog is an interesting example, because the pre-Hungarfen trash is the hardest bit of the instance, and Hungarfen is the hardest boss. After that it's like you're in Heroic Lite. The first time we went in there we were very worried about the Naga pulls because we lacked any kind of humanoid CC. Imagine our surprise when we found out they hardly hit any harder than they do on Normal.<br>
<br>
Heroics are just badly implemented at the moment, in my opinion. Tone down the trash, buff the bosses, give them meaningful new abilities. Then they might be more fun.</div>

</div>I disagree with you besides level 70 heroics where the same loot drops. <br>
<br>
I think Heroics along with badges provide an excellent time/risk vs reward for 5 man groups. Also, in general, I wouldn't use the term 'hard' for Heroic trash but rather precise. It requires you to CC, assist, tank, and heal. You certainly can't zerg through it without a care like in normal mode.<br>
<br>
There are some discrepancies from instance to instance when it comes to tuning but for the most part it's not bad.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Also, I think a lot of people don't do heroics much.  I've spent a lot of time looking up people in endgame guilds on armory (often people I see topping DMs in the Sustained DPS thread, for pointers to pass along to our own guys), and a shocking number, based on their rep, clearly haven't done any heroics beyond maybe SSC attunement.  I've seen lots of casters with +1000 or +1200 damage from full tailored sets, using a green caster trinket because they haven't done enough heroics for an Icon.  It's surprisingly, though maybe my own perspective is skewed since I've earned 200ish badges and am spending them on DPS toys now.</div>

</div>I'd tend to agree, I see a lot of folk running around in full Spellfire/Shadoweave sets that don't have icons, gear/gems from heroics or the aforementioned Icon (picked mine up, love it). I think that the risk vs. reward just isn't there, even for the needed FR gear eventually. Personally I'm not that fond of heroics (making trash hit harder doesn't make it "heroic") but I go to help guildies out quite a bit, which is why I have a nice badge collection lying around for various things. On the other hand I hate farming, as an herbalist I spend hours a week farming herbs and don't really want to be bothered farming Primals on top of that so I'm lacking in all the BOE stuff I could have. I wish that Blizzard could at least off similar quality items to tailoring BOEs through Heroics, but I digress.<br>
<br>
As for Magtheridon, it doesn't sound like they changed much of the fight other than dropping the heavy DPS requirements off it and making it more of a control fight centered around the big guy himself. After all, it IS Magtheridon's Lair, shouldn't the fight be about Mr. Pit Lord himself and not some dinky Channelers? I dunno, we've yet to really work on it as we've been farming Nightbane and working on Gruul recently (have yet to do the "ezmoad" post hotfix version) so hopefully we'll get to it soon. I can say with certainty that the changes sound more in-line for what the fight should be about though.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_308870"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->on the topic of SSC, and nerf possibilities there:<br>
<br>
There is no doubt further bosses in SSC will be nerfed soon, and hard. Guilds just entering SSC after the massive nerfs to Gruul and Nightbane will be able to kill Hydross with a pretty straighforward strategy. (and a slight bit of luck. the 250% tank through thing in nature phase and just having almost all of your healers on the tank, with one healing people with the dot). a fully potted/buffed tank with proper gear (nothing too difficult to get since it's resist gear) could do it.<br>
<br>
However beyond that, I can see them annihilating some of the bosses so more than just a few guilds will ever even see Vashj. Leotheras is currently the only fight in the game that I can see for a long while requiring a fully buffed raid, at least dps, for quite a while. Even raid stacking will be required, there are two tanking strategies you can use, and one of them allows melee to dps properly, but only for half of the fight. Still doesn't compare to a ranged class.<br>
<br>
I know gear levels and such vary, but Gruul, Magtheridon, etc etc have not and will not ever require a fully flasked, buffed, potted, etc raid to kill - Karazhan equiv. loot is sufficient.<br>
<br>
But Leotheras (and likely as they swing that bat, other stuff will follow) will literally be a shadow of his former self, much like the polar opposite Gruul is now.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

But what annoys me is even if they do stuff like that, melee dps is still largely useless. Casters can dps during whirlwind phase (a large portion of the fight), melee can't. That is dumb.

</div>My problem exactly. Before we ramped up to a full raid schedule, I was running a heroic every night I played. But most heroic runs take 2+ hours where most normal mode runs are under 90 minutes. It just doesn't fit in the same night as a raid. I run a couple on the weekends, and that's all.<br>
<br>
If I weren't raiding, I'd love heroics. I usually have a blast running them. But while the time commitment is perfectly manageable for someone sits down and wants to run one as their night's play session, it's just not something you can squeeze in before or after a raid.<br>
<br>
I suspect that when badge FR becomes a priority for the guild, we'll need to cancel some raids to form badge-farming teams. For people whose play time doesn't exceed raid time by more than 2 hours a day, heroics are a tough proposition.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Ugh, this is the worst rumor in I don't know how long.<br>
<br>
<b>Zero (0) Fire Resistance is needed or desired for Magtheridon.  It is not something that anyone in your raid will wear.  The Badge FR is for Tempest Keep.</b><br>
<br>
Also, I think a lot of people don't do heroics much.  I've spent a lot of time looking up people in endgame guilds on armory (often people I see topping DMs in the Sustained DPS thread, for pointers to pass along to our own guys), and a shocking number, based on their rep, clearly haven't done any heroics beyond maybe SSC attunement.  I've seen lots of casters with +1000 or +1200 damage from full tailored sets, using a green caster trinket because they haven't done enough heroics for an Icon.  It's surprisingly, though maybe my own perspective is skewed since I've earned 200ish badges and am spending them on DPS toys now.</div>

</div>Yeah I'm surprised too. I have 2 FR pieces so far and my trinket and OH and I have not in any way been actively farming - though I have been playing a bit. We have one person in the guild with full FR, and I don't think near anyone else has many.<br>
<br>
But then most have been going for the OH/Shields/Trinkets if they have had badges, as that's more immediate reward.<br>
<br>
And to be frank with the heroic requirements, the previous state of Mag, and the current state of Gruul, most Guilds will be doing SSC for a while before they get everyone attuned for TK (only 4 people in our Mag kill completed their attunment by doing it), so why bother?<br>

<br>
So reducing the groups required to click cubes from 4 groups to 2 groups.<br>
<br>
Which is good in it allows people to died (had an attempt today wipe because 4 people died, 1 person clicked early and everyone else but 4 people had mind exhaustion prolly should have had the tank run across the room to click it after the other 4 were clicked).<br>

		<div id="post_message_309370"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->We went to Mag yesterday to test the changes (never killed before and failed also yesterday). I have to say the nerfing of the adds made the fight much easier from the DPS requirement part, but it does not make the fight a joke, not even close. The fight is all about skill and coordination now, and I actually really enjoyed the fight despite our poor performance.<br>
<br>
Here's some observations:<br>
- Since trash respawn is still 1h and it continues to spawn during the encounter, we still spent one quarter of the raid time clearing trash or waiting for it to respawn.<br>
- Add damage was tuned also down, a druid could easily tank 2 first adds at the same time. Also a single healer was able to keep tanks alive much more reliably, I think we lost maybe once a add tank before it was a wipe because of other reasons. Last week one fear on a healer healing solo a tank could cause a death easily.<br>
- Interruption was still very big part of the p1, several times we failed on this and we had 2 adds alive when Mag released.<br>
- We had our best geared druid tanking Mag, and 50% of our wipes were caused by him simply dying. We had only 7 healers, next time we will bring 1-2 more. He was hitting 12-13k crushings on our druid, and normal hits as high as 9k. With some more practice we could have kept him alive better, but most of the times he died when we were finishing last adds and healing on him was tight (also, there was no TC/demo shout right after activation). We changed a prot warrior to tank Mag in the very end, removing those crushing blows will ease the healing a lot. Are guilds still using druid tanks after the hotfix, or is prot warrior simply better? Good thing about prot MT is also that it frees a druid to do cat DPS.<br>
<br>
We did not manage to focus on the clicking part yet enough, but I don't remember the 1,5 minute Mind Exhauston cooldown mentioned by guildies, so most likely we still had 3 mins (and we had 4 clicking groups). However, I think the 1,5 min cooldown is exactly what the fight needs on a long term, it gives much more error tolerance when you can actually lose over 5 people and still do it. At least our guild has huge ping differences, and several have simply horrible connection. Now it will be very easy to pick the people who can handle the clicking 100% certain. <br>
<br>
As for the difficulty, I think it's still above the old Gruul. However, there's 0 random elements and since 10 people required only for clicking, I think it might be well enough tuned to stay like this. Only thing that really needs to be changed is the trash, specially the fact that it might respawn during the fight.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_309387"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I think the mind exhaustion debuff is closer to 1 minute 10 seconds myself but that's pretty irrelevant.  It's a fun fight at the moment and took us basically 3 hours to get down.  But debris for 60k? Wow.  Didn't lose anyone to it I don't think, all I took was ~5k.  Trash respawn is a little quick, but it didn't seem overly over the top.  I like how it primes you for the abilities of the channelers.<br>
<br>
Magtheridon's hp though is just a bit much in my opinion.  As long as you're competent it seems you can tank him and banish him for nearly an eternity.  Only real highlights of the fight are getting on the cubes in time and getting the rotation to work in order to stop the blastwave from killing raid members, dodging ground fire, and the 30% debris drop.  Not sure why he really needs 4.5+million hp since he really isn't a DPS check at the moment.  Just takes a bit long is all really.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_309402"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->We were making decent progress in the pre-nerf encounter, but the hotfix came at an excellent time: we had the encounter basics down and being able to kill the adds faster resulted in a quite clean kill last night.<br>
<br>
To echo some of the posts above, I think the encounter is very nicely balanced now. We still had the 3 minute Mind Exhaustion as well, so we needed the entire raid group focused &amp; mostly alive. With quite heavy consumables we were able to drop 4 adds at the time of Magtheridon getting released, and drop the final add before the first Blastwave. I suspect similar timing to be possible without heavy consumables by getting maybe 1 more DPS class, gearing up a bit and executing just slightly better. And even now that Magtheridon hits very hard, it won’t be a complete disaster if you to have to fight 2 adds for a bit after his release.<br>
<br>
And yeah, Magtheridon himself has quite a bit of HP, perhaps some reduction would be good especially if the Mind Exhaustion timer is reduced and the box rotation will be shorter anyway.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_309409"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Mag was pretty fun, we had a great time tonight and ended up taking him down after a few hours. I want to emphasize the fun because raiding so far in BC was feeling like a job (leading raids and the guild is enough of that).<br>
<br>
The meat of the encounter fighting Magtheridon was 'buffed' in that he hits decently hard. The former hard part of the fight was balanced quite nicely. Having to flask/pot (or both) up just to get to Magtheridon was IMO pretty poor (we worked on him for an hour or two pre hotfix and it wasn't fun asking my guild to reclear trash).<br>
<br>
Mag is pretty much where he should be in terms of balance. We got the super easymode Gruul this week where he didn't hateful, so we will see next week how the encounter plays out. Might still be too nerfed, but then again maybe not.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Tonight after a good 10mins of explanation, we went in, killed 3.5 unpotted. After a few attempts, and a trash respawn clear, a flask on dps to speed things up and the 5th was dieing before the 1st rumble... clicking is still a major thing tho as we quickly learned heh.<br>
As we pulled with less than 5mins left on our flasks (just long enough to kill all adds !) everyone seemed to actualy click on time and bam, first kill woohoo !<br>

Pretty sure we'll do it with just elixirs next week, feels finely tuned.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Trash has always been there to stop you throwing yourself at a boss constantly, I think with this trash though they meant it to teach you about the first phase. The respawn sucks but it will only affect you when learning the encounter after that it should be funny to mock people feared behind barriers etc<br>
<br>
Having only 50~ mins on him adds a little more value to the kill too and stops your most lazy people going afk every pull <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080407224621im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/biggrin.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":D" class="inlineimg"><br>
<br>
Those damage stats are kind of weird, our top damage classes had all done like 1 million each, this is probably due to our 3 or 4th add healing each other or something but cant help but think they may have nerfed his HP somewhat.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Side Note Question: How many people actaully hold the Stun for the damage boost? <br>
<br>
We make everyone hold until they hit half HP (its like 4 -5 seconds for the boost) and when he did a Blast Nova at 17%, the second he broke, he sprinted over, 1 hit a mage, and then ran back to our MT. Then on vent we hear "10k Crit Fireball..."<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>2 groups of 5 ?! Wow thats a big nerf, but needed I guess - now the fight is a test of coordination but not hinging on the lives of all but 4 players.<br>
<br>
on the channeling - we tell people to break it if they are in danger of dying, the damage boost is quite short and I would guess just a gimick of them tuning the encounter - at some point i'd imagine you could only damage him when he was debuffed ala cthun.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>
