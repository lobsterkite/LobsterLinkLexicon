		<div id="post_message_408291"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->This question is obviously for those who've found such sudden success on this encounter; whereas my guild has hit a wall of sorts. The question is simple, how many shamans does your guild run on the encounter? Im simply wondering if they're a large part of the difference between success and failure, or if we've just had a few bad days.<br>
<br>
To set the scene a little, let me explain. After the trash nerf, as was the case with many guilds, we decided to put some more effort into Hyjal. We learnt and killed every boss the first night of pulls on each; Rage through to Archimonde. In BT, we've gone through bloodboil.<br>
<br>
But Archimonde has been a completely different story. What is essentially a very straight-forward encounter is proving otherwise. The multitude of ways we've died is phenomenal. We've had the obligatory cratering. And despite the odd death or two from it now (like 1 in 20 attempts) it has largely been removed as a problem. We've had grip killing people because it was cast a second before fear sends them flying across the landscape away from decursers. We've had the MT die during fears if full HOTs arent up. We've had deaths from a person recieving Grip, and then being punted via Burst... thus OOR of any possible cleanse. Deaths from fear sending people on ridiculous paths through the fire walls. Deaths from the fires pathing so ridiculously that a person literally cannot move; encircled by fire...<br>
<br>
We generally run one shaman (resto). There are no other raiding shamans in our guild (none yet attuned anyway), and our healing is generally paladin 'heavy' with 2 priests and a druid filling out the remaining spots. <br>
<br>
To combat the above problems, we've tried a number of things:<br>
-Paladins rotating bubbles/fear trinkets to break fear and ensure at least one person is available to heal during fear's duration.<br>
-A mage, druid, shaman, paladin, priest group with tremor totem to heal the random fear/fire combos, cleanse grips and heal the MT.<br>
-A druid out of fear range to save the people who get Grip + Burst, throw HOTs etc.<br>
-Require everyone to bring the pvp trinket to save themselves in the "oh shit" moments where fear literally paths them right at a fire wall.<br>
<br>
I announce incoming fears. HOTs go up, people move well clear of any existing fires. The raid is spread to minimise players affected by bursts etc. It doesnt seem to matter.<br>
<br>
We've survived something like 8 fears without a single death before something inevitably goes wrong. And as those who've done the encounter will know; the probability of 'chain deaths' is quite high. Sadly, the best % we've seen is 50-odd. (DPS has never been an issue for the guild in the past either. We were a guild that killed Loatheb, never using world buffs, putting out 20k DPS. We killed the original gruul, so on.). I dont even want to state the number of attempts we've put on him the past few days.<br>
<br>
So there's our situation. We're trying to deal with nearly 80% of the raid being feared every cooldown and the encounter is lasting way too long before probability kicks in and somebody dies.<br>
<br>
Are shamans, and therefore tremor totems by implication, such a big deal on this fight? Or has my guild been having a bad few days and sucking it up? (I cant rule the possibility out, I managed to live through all attempts as a hunter, so maybe people are just not understanding the implications of failing to survive at all costs... or I was just lucky all day)<br>
<br>
Any input would be appreciated. Our experience so far is proving Archimonde to be anything but the "Loot bag" that others describe him to be, and that videos show. And frankly, at this point I'm loathe to even bother attempting him next week before we attune another shaman.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_408307"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->We killed archimonde on the second attempt after the 7 wipes the day previously. Everything just clicked and went well. We went back this week and spent an entire day on it before doing it again, as people weren't sticking to the layout we had assigned the week before and dying to things like grip + fire dot -&gt; burst and being out of range of anyone who could've helped them.<br>
<br>
How do you spread your raid out? Do you have a full circle, "camps" around him, a semicircle, or something else? Having camps where people try and stick together helps a lot for grips (we use 3 groups in a triangle). People need to stick to these camps too - ranged people should have their priorities as staying alive first, which includes being near their assigned decursers, and making sure they don't get doomfired.<br>
<br>
There are a lot of tricks you can use to avoid fire, and if people do hit fire they need to be using EVERYTHING they can to survive. Even a bandage for 3 ticks in between the fire dot helps.<br>
<br>
You can control the fire too - it generally locks on to someone who is in front of it, and will follow them if they turn too slowly. Think of it like a heat seeking missile in a film - if you turn slowly it just follows, but if you double back very quickly it loses the lock and carries on straight. <br>
<br>
Other things include:<br>
PvP trinket for fears (or glimmering mithril insignia if it works?)<br>
Druids using shapeshifting runspeed mechanics to change direction mid-fear<br>
Fear Ward (noticed you're alliance - always possible you don't have a dwarf priest I suppose) - might be worth putting this on healers/decursers instead of the tank and getting him to stancedance as you're lacking tremors.<br>
<br>
As an aside, we've had 3 shamans both times we killed him I think, but tremors are hardly reliable to say the least. I wouldn't be surprised if it's saved melee getting feared into fire a few times though. You should also consider giving your shaman to the melee as they'll do a lot more DPS with totems, and have the bubble/etc rotation on healers for the tank healing (or use fear ward, if you have a couple).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_408315"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->We spread the raid out in a semi circle behind Archimonde. The decursers are spaced among the raid so that everyone is covered. We place a raid icon on their heads so that whoever gets grip knows exactly where to move to to ensure they are in range for removal.<br>
<br>
Interesting analogy on the fire. Assuming that is the mechanic, it'dl be much more controllable. A line might devide the raid, but we've had that happen and it's generally not a problem. I'll get people trying that.<br>
<br>
No luck on the fear ward either. Haven't had one of those since C'thun. We rely on our tank dancing every fear.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_408317"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Our main problem with Archimonde was also positioning, for the most part. It seems that the camp method, standing in a mid circle behind him as to avoid the fire as much as possible (and maybe moving with it), is the way to go. I still believe that grip during the burst phase is absurd and sometimes a death simply cannot be avoided, especially if you are not heavy on decursers. We brought 3 shamans the first time as well (sadly we are missing a dwarf/dranei priest which would simplify things), but I will agree on the fact that you cannot entirely rely on tremor totems.<br>
<br>
We intend to revisit him today, hopefully, control will be better.<br>
<br>
By the way, question for those that have killed him. Do you find the PvP trinket worth a slot in this fight, considering the fact that is highly situational and can only be used around 3-4 times (considering the fact you even have the level 70 trinket that is) ? Shouldn't you attempt to control the fire better rather than relying on such a solution ?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_408323"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->It took us basically a full night before we killed him, same issues you're describing.  We had 3 shamans, 2 resto and 1 enhance keeping tremor down in the melee group.  We had everyone spread out in a semicircle behind him, 3 decursers spread out within that semicircle and a resto druid standing well behind everyone to help decurse/heal those that got airbursted.<br>
<br>
Airburst is a 1.5s cast and you have a second or so after the cast before they're out of range, if someone gets hit with that and they still have grip then the decursing really was too slow.  If someone gets grip right before a fear and it doesn't get cleansed quickly they probably need to trinket out of it to help the decursers get to them, but once again you've got a gcd or so from when grip is cast to the earliest you can be feared.  If someone doesn't have their trinket up, they need to make sure to get much further from the fire than they normally would, even if it means running out of dps range briefly.  Almost every death is in some way your own fault.<br>
<br>
We had alot more of our wipes from fall damage, or people dying because they got grip right after the airburst and didn't use healthstones/pots to help buy time to get themselves back in range.  Even on our kill we had someone die at 22% or so, and the MT died at 12%.  Made for quite an exciting final phase with only 14 people left alive <!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_408324"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->If you think of it this way what other trinket allows you to DPS 7 extra seconds every 2 minutes? I've used the trinket before just to be able to DPS when everyone else is feared. No other trinket in the game gives you close to this much extra damage. <br>
<br>
Tremor totems are required for this fight and the more you bring the greater the chance your tank has for living and the higher your dps will be. Melee dps needs a totem to avoid the fire during fears (correct me if I'm wrong) and a Healer group also needs a totem to keep the MT up.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_408389"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Well, despite many guilds claiming he's free loot, we wiped many hours on him too, with 1 shaman only in the raid.<br>
I do think the more shamans you have, the better you will perform. We wiped countless times because of stupid things like mt dying during fear for example. Only 1 tremor totem means you give it to the melee grp, which means you have to rely on trinket/invuln chains to manage mt healing, and it's obviously very dangerous.<br>
Things we changed to get a kill :<br>
- We put a druid 40 yard behind the raid. His main job is to decurse the 2 ou 3 people who get grip + air burst. This combo WILL happen and it killed us many times. The druid can at least ns heal + decurse to avoid this.<br>
- We tried to dps very high. Archimonde is a very random fight, there's many things that can go wrong (someone cratered, grip + air burst + fear combos, mt dying to a spike, fear in doomfire... and so on). So, try to kill him as fast as possible.<br>
- Everyone equipped pvp trinket. It will help you, period. Be it to dps more, to avoid a doomfire, to place the heal which will save your mt, it's the best trinket you can use if you don't have 3 or more shamans.<br>
- HS / Pot life or shadow on everyone. Everybody in your raid should be able to heal himself of 5k dmg or so.<br>
<br>
We didn't have time to do hyjal again this week, but honnestly, I fear this fight. I'm sure we won't oneshot him. I still find him hard, at least with 1 shaman only.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Have people stand in groups with a decurse (druids including ferals can decurse!) should stop burst + grip from killing people 99% of the time.<br>
You should never use a pvp trinket unless your about to run into a fire, bar 10% it is not a DPS encounter.<br>
Your tank shouldn't be dying during a fear, have a priest shield on the fear (tot castbar) and use HoTs, that should be plenty - if hes dying to doomfire it might be better using firepots instead of ironshield. (reactively)<br>
Obviously not that helpful if your lacking shamans but use bloodlust/heroism before 'phase 2' as you are immune to it then.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_408494"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->We wiped for over 3 hours with nonstop pulling before got the kill (and 1 and half hours on day before). Our main problem was lack of decursers online, 2 mages and 1 druid was not enough. We had almost 2 full melee groups and 3 shamans, meaning there was not enough tremors for decursers. We swapped 1 melee out and got second druid online and changed the groups so that all the of decursers and half of the MT healers got tremor instead of an UD rogue and some hunters that were previously in melee groups. We also positioned 1 druid way behind the raid for decurses/ranged healing. Suddenly people stopped dying and we got a comfortable kill (1 shaman died though quite early). However, I'm certain we will wipe on him a lot in the future also and he is definetely not free loot for us.<br>
<br>
Good thing about Archimonde is that there's no trash at all, you can do try after try without any worries of respawns, and there's no 10 minute p1 like on Kael before the action really starts. I think this is a big factor considering how fast guilds have killed this. We  propably wiped on Archimonde in total more times than we normally wipe on hard bosses before first kill, but since you can just corpse run and be ready for next pull in few minutes, wipe early in the fight is not that big deal.<br>
<br>
We also took a different approach than Dawme posted earlier, we did not stack DPS, we stacked healers. We had 10 healers in total in the end, 2 druids were focusing on dispelling though. We thought a big amount of healers was needed because our pimped out MT was not able to raid, and our second MT was a lacking some gear upgrades. It turned to be a good decision, usually there was always someone who resisted fear or used trinket/Wotf. We also marked MT healers instead of decursers, so they knew how to avoid stacking up with other MT healers in order to avoid Air Bursts. In general, MT was usually one of the last persons alive when wiping.<br>
<br>
I used the 5 min PVP trinket once in the fight, but next time I won't equip it unless I farm the 2 min version. As an undead, WoTF was enough in addition to tremor totem. With WoTF + 2 min PVP trinket you could remove almost every fear, 2 priests doing this would almost guarantee 1 healer always ready to heal MT (unless Air Bursted). Balances Fear Ward quite nicely.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

We position our raid on the "uphill" side of Archimonde in a 180 to lessen the distance created by punts, and leave a resto druid 70ish yards away to HoT/decurse people in the back.

</div>The fight doesn't seem the same really. Fires now appear to spawn about 10 yards away from Archimonde, as opposed to previously when they could spawn right on top of melee.  They also only spread outwards away from him now, but still seem to "lock" on to people until you cut at a 90 degree angle. At least this is what I noticed when we did him.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Our last kill fire was following me so I turned right past it but it continued to follow me, forming a small Aran-esque circle of fiery death, which also curiously stopped moving at all when it doubled back on itself (despite being a relatively "fresh" doomfire).  Thank god for PVP trinkets.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">The fight doesn't seem the same really. Fires now appear to spawn about 10 yards away from Archimonde, as opposed to previously when they could spawn right on top of melee.  They also only spread outwards away from him now, but still seem to "lock" on to people until you cut at a 90 degree angle. At least this is what I noticed when we did him.</div>

</div>Yeah, seemed this way to us as well.<br>
<br>
Also...I might be crazy, but the doomfire dot doesn't seem to last as long - I ran into a doomfire during a called wipe and it ticked twice and fell off, after the doomfire despawned.   I'd say its something that should be tested, but I doubt thats something anyone would want to "test" lol.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_420642"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Regarding the shaman issue, they are key to the encounter. The difference tremor makes is unbelievable, fewer people will be feared into the fire, those feared in it will be healed quicker, and so will the MT. You can decurse faster and do more DPS. While DPS is largely irrelevant in this encounter it does shorten the window in which you can die to his various abilities. If we had 4 shamans online, I would bring 4 shamans. If we only had 2, I would cry tears of sorrow, but probably still attempt it. We've never killed him with 1, and I'm not planning to try.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_420674"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Honestly, stacking shamans is the way to go if you can.  We had one for each group.  Accept that weird things are going to happen, and everyone has to be prepared for it -- I'm looking at you Burst + Grip.  I wouldn't really rely on Purfication Potions, I had them fail both times.  I suppose you could get lucky and have it work, but it's better just to pot+healthstone and buy yourself an extra tick or two to get in range of a decurser.  <br>
<br>
The thing about Doomfire is it's not really a big deal if 2 or 3 people have it.  Once you get past the first few ticks, it's pretty simple to heal.  The problem is when you get a bad fear, 7 people get Doomfired, then there's an air burst and 5 people get tossed away.  You stop that with either shaman stacking or smart positioning.  When we went in with only 3 decursers, we just didn't spread out in some random circle around him, we had fairly detailed places to stand so there would be a decurser in range of everyone - and the decurser was marked with a symbol so you were always aware of where all 3 of them were.  <br>
<br>
Trying Archimonde with 1 or 2 shamans is like trying the old Magtheridon with 1 or 2 warlocks.  Yeah, I suppose you could try to do it, but why would you make life so hard on yourself?   I realize you only have 1 attuned at the moment, but at least it should make you feel better that it's not necessarily your play that is bad here, it's more about your group composition.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_421101"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->You can shift out of forms, just not into them while feared (you can shift out during most/all CC).  Doing so from a form that has a different run speed than your base caster form forces the game to redo some processing because of the change and has the side-effect of also redoing the random direction you're moving while feared.  You may not even need a different run speed, but my experiences seem to point to it.<br>
<br>
This is similar to how if a warlock Fears a mob, puts Curse of Recklessness on the mob, then removes the curse while the fear is still active, the mob will once again pick a random direction to move in.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
Here are my most valueable moments what killed ppl:<br>
<br>
- Airburst followed by a Grip midair, landing so far away that not even Pizza Hut would deliver<br>
- Airburst, slowly and without any other possibility landing in Doomfire and Achimonde so kind enough to give Grip/Fear<br>
- Feared running into a Doomfire and a lovly Airburst<br>
<br>
We had the encounter so many times just perfect stable, when suddenly one of the many killer combos killed one.<br>

		<div id="post_message_421128"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->The new Doomfire makes me wonder how we ever had any problems with the old Doomfire.<br>
<br>
I think Archimonde needs a little more tuning to be considered fun in my book. I'm a firm believer that every single possible death on this encounter is preventable, but it is too random to be fun.<br>
<br>
Tonight I caused a wipe because I was Air Bursted on top of a Doomfire and then immediately feared directly down its path. My trinket still had 60 seconds left on its cooldown. As far as I'm concerned I was lucky he didn't cast Grip on me aswell. Even this ridiculous death was preventable, but Archimonde creates some absurd situations that are simply going to wipe you because people make mistakes on raids, it's a fact and it will always be a fact.<br>
<br>
What is essentially the most random encounter I can remember is also the encounter that punishes people for their mistakes more severely than any other encounter I can remember. That seems like a problem, but maybe I'm just forgetting some encounters?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
Doomfire is healable, and with the current length of fears etc you should calculate for things like that to happen.<br>
The suggestion for purification potions is really nice aswell, alltho we didnt use it, i guess it would have saved us a whipe or 2.<br>
<br>
A little tip from my side, if you are ranged and find yourself trapped by fire with his fear off cooldown, find a tree or a log, it will make sure you get feared within the same place.<br>

</div>Stupid fucking berserk timer.<br>
The 1 minute timer to do 10% is a Death/DPS check.<br>
Soul Charges and a RTS system on Grips/Air Burst are death/DPS checks.<br>
Having a flawlessly executed kill where  5 melee had to stay out for 70% of the fight because of Doomfire spawns and wiping at 12% with a full raid to an insta kill Hand of Death is just poor fucking design.<br>
<br>
<br>
Edit - And yea, sure it's controllable, but sometimes stupid shit just adds up too quickly to be dealt with reliably. Getting air bursted and floating into a doomfire while grip casts on you is awesome.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I agree with this - I was fairly unaccepting tonight when people gave me excuses.  Near the end, on our low attempts, we had the worst luck you could imagine - but people weren't dying.  <br>
<br>
On our berserk attempt we survived doomfires like you couldn't imagine - triple air bursts on one individual with a grip each time on that same person.  Grips always on the person furthest from a mage.  All that shit was dealt with so that we could be instagibbed at some artificial timer... 2% out.  Yet while it was dealt with, I consider us lucky - cause it just as easily may not have been dealt with.  He might fear during that bad grip, etc.  <br>
<br>
I would guess that on at least 4-5 pulls we executed nearly flawlessly, and still wiped.  On the attempt after that one, I got quintuple parries (I shit you not), and died in 1.6 seconds or something retarded (I had 22k HP and was in my "avoidance" gear with the scarab popped).  <br>

</div>Even this happened to us a lot, which is horseshit really - but its dealable.  The problem comes when 2-5 of these things happen in rapid succession.  If everything was easily manageable folks would one shot this boss every time.  But they don't.  <br>
<br>
This fight needs a lot of work - sad thing is it probably won't get it since its a high end fight.<br>
<br>
This is how you fix Archimonde:<br>
- Remove the fucking berserk timer, or remove soul charge (obviously you remove the timer).  <br>
- Make it so he cannot grip within 7 seconds of an air burst.  <br>
- Remove the parry mechanic from the game.  <br>
- Don't allow him to spawn new doomfires within 10 seconds of a fear (this one is also horseshit).<br>
- Fix spirit of redemption causing double soul charges.<br>
- Allow the boss to crush and fix his damage output to scale accordingly (I know this one isn't obvious, but just think it over and you'll get it).  <br>
<br>
Some ideas to improve the fight (not needed):<br>
- Increase the air burst cast time by 1 second so a skillful player can juke it.  <br>
- Increase fear cast timer by 1.0 seconds.  <br>
- Decrease fear duration by 2.0 seconds. Or allow the fear to be resistable.<br>
- Place a pond in the northwest that also dispels doomfire debuff.  <br>
- Make it so that doomfires don't grow too far behind the raid.<br>
<br>
Edit:<br>
PS: I forgot to mention I have the brutalizer, and gloves of enforcement, when I got quintuple parried.  Pretty fun.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
No amount of skill on the MT's part can prevent being parried. It's a completely random and stupid 'feature'. Remove it and destroy all evidence of its existence.<br>
<br>
I think a lot of people would be surprised at just how many MT deaths are caused by the parry mechanic. On fights like Azgalor and Archimonde, a non-MT getting parried is often catastrophic.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Wait ... do player parries reset the swing timer of mobs as well? If yes I was extremely lucky yesterday tanking him, I think we only had 1 or 2 wipes because of sudden MT death.<br>

		<div id="post_message_421165"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Yes it reduces the swing timer on bosses as well.  On our first kill we went probably 3 hours of attempts with only 1 MT death - but that one, and the one I mentioned above were both on early kill attempts (low %, everyone up), where basically a series of parries kill you.  We even were using GoA instead of windfury (thats how bad it gets), and it still instagibbed me both times.  1.6 seconds, 2.5 seconds for full hp (plus 2-8k over).  No other players were in front of the boss.<br>
<br>
A MT's parry should not kill him... other melee's parry is reasonable, but it adds some really dumb lotto to the mix - and frankly, just removing it is better altogether.<br>
<br>
I would also not be so bold to say fear ward trivializes this encounter - but a fear warded feral druid sure as hell trivializes the tanking aspect of it.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Yes. We went from using our usual MT to using our feral druid OT(4pc T5, 1pc T6 etc). Mitigation change was so substantial that as long as one Paladin was free to spam FoL at any time could solo keep her up(assuming reasonable dodge occurances). Not to mention the additional TPS gain from using a tank that doesn't have to worry about stance dancing such a short cast.<br>
<br>
We fear ward the MT(druid) and one shaman that tremors 2 paladins and 1 priest instantly after a fear. Definitely huge.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>You can shift out of forms - cat form has +30% runspeed as long as you have the talent, and when you shift out of it it counts as a speed change, hence changing direction. Tree druids count the same (-20%-&gt;normal) when shifting out too, but I doubt many druids are using it on an encounter where curses are a big thing.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_421248"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->My guild spent last night trying to do archimonde for about 3-4 hours, was around something like 23 attempts.  Christ, the number of random deaths is insane, but the most prevalent one I saw was air burst + curse.  Whats that? Being out of the fight isn't enough? Take this curse of I'm going to cause you to wipe your raid and have your name added to the noob list.<br>
<br>
I didn't notice spirit of redemption causing two soul charges, I died once around our 13th attempt and didn't see it happen, maybe we were already wiped and I didn't notice the soul suck from my body.<br>
<br>
The penalty for any kind of death on that encounter is harsh.   Here raid take this extreme instant raid damage while I continue to air burst, curse and fire you, hope you're in range of a healer!<br>
<br>
I cry in the general direction of blizzards game design team after this fight, "Fear ward will never be a game breaking mechanic in TBC" along those lines, seriously, a tank that has to stance dance vs fear ward druid (uber hp and armor and dodge with no parry instantly gimping the mt?) Seriously?  <br>

- Remove the fucking berserk timer, or remove soul charge (obviously you remove the timer). <br>
- Remove the parry mechanic from the game. <br>
- Fix spirit of redemption causing double soul charges.<br>
- Allow the boss to crush and fix his damage output to scale accordingly (I know this one isn't obvious, but just think it over and you'll get it). <br>
- Decrease fear duration by 2.0 seconds. Or allow the fear to be resistable.

</div><br>
These are the ones that I agree with, but I also think that the tears of the goddess should either:<br>
a) remove curse (25% failure maybe)<br>
b) extinguish fire on yourself<br>
c) break fear<br>
<br>
Although those all may trivialize the fight but seriously, air burst + curse gimping is fun!<br>

		<div id="post_message_421254"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->We killed him last night after roughly 40 attempts. Hell this fight is so random, while at the same time it could be so much fun.<br>
<br>
Our way to prevent burst+grip deaths was to split the raid in 3 groups.<br>
<br>
Basically every group had a healer and a decurser. The decurser was marked with a raidicon so you can find him rather easily. Now, the "trick" is to stick together at all times. Stand right in your decurser so  the group of ~4 people will get thrown all ot once and the decurser can decurse cursed (fuck the word "curse 8[) people in midair and a healer can heal doomfire, if needed. It takes a lot randomness out of the fight, but at the same time the 3 groups have to be very aware of the fires going around and move accordingly. <br>
<br>
We wiped a lot to fire and grip on melees, but had a resto druid standing next to the melee grp, so he could heal and decurse them at the same time, when get thrown.<br>
<br>
If executed properly and no shitty doomfires, it's a sure kill because except for the fire there's nothing random in the fight anymore.<br>
<br>
Just stay FAR away from fire when the last fear was 30 seconds ago <!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_421255"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->We just learned and killed archimonde with the new doomfire mechanics... I've never seen a fight that asks for so much raid stacking in BC. <br>
<br>
Stacking shamans and resto druids makes it 10x easier. Raid wide tremor. Decurse/Heal coverage for everyone + Hots for your MT while feared.<br>
<br>
My suggestions for his current state:<br>
<br>
- Make the fear window more consistant. 30-35 secs or make the cast time longer. Our MT couldn't do anything without running into. "Another action is in progress" or missing it by .3 secs.<br>
- Add a 5-8 second delay for grip after an air burst is casted. (Some people might argue that you were supposed to be close to a mage so he would get tossed too and decurse mid-air but this brings me to the next point)<br>
- CHANGE FEAR FOR THE LOVE OF GOD. The whole concept of using a PVP trinket to avoid the Doomfire + air burst combo is beyond stupid. Sorry had to get that out of my system.<br>
- Change doomfire to work like a CoA. Increasing its damage overtime instead of the opposite way. That gives you the choice to either run to the well and be silenced or team up with a healer to keep you up. <br>
Most deaths on a serious attempt once everything clicks is fear with everything down into a doomfire then getting air bursted. There's only so much you can do to stay alive when your survivability cooldowns are constantly drained by luck. <br>
<br>
After writing this... I still think there's a lot of improvement to be done in our execution but I'm not looking forward to archimonde next week.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>No seriously, it was double HS, Shield slam, and a shield bash all parried - and one of them had a windfury - the other was goa'ed - the same event twice, no shadow fiend, no pets... just my own parries, with 40 or so skill rating to boot.  Its basically instagib if he hits back.  I even got a screenshot of part of the log.  We know better than to allow "pets" in front of the boss.<br>
<br>
We ended up getting to the point where most of the late attempts doomfire wasn't an issue - but then the McRandom shit would hit us and basically spell doom.  It was basically throwing yourself at the encounter X times, and see if one of them works out well - not "okay lets execute better".  I honestly don't see how we can improve our strat.  How does someone prevent being air bursted into a doomfire?  (especially melee).  <br>
<br>
Basically strats are "spread out, adapat and avoid doomfire."  We even had the "clump with a shaman, mage, and healer group".  We tried the "these two people will help you get to the well to remove doomfire" strat.  All of them are basically about equal, because none of them address issues of randomness.  At least before when you were in a 180, you could assign 1-2 druids to "catch" the air burst + grip, but with doomfires being all over its less realistic to have mid-air catchers right where they need to be.  <br>
<br>
I don't think this fight is at all what the devs intended.  I'm pretty sure they've never even played this fight on a real server either.  The whole tears of the goddess part of the encounter is the most laughably simple part of it.  We had maybe 1 crater all night due to someone's keys not being bound.  What we did wipe to was people being feared, doomfires spawning DURING their fear, and then having the fear run them through the doomfire... fear dispellers are either busy or too far, and its over in seriously 2 seconds (doomfire spawning while the fear is up is ridiculous).  Or the melee get gripped, air bursted, and land IN a doomfire.  Tank gets instagibbed... Priest dies somehow and its over.  That shit is just stupid.  <br>
<br>
Yeah the fight is "repeatable", and yes we've improved a bit - but we could've killed it on our first pull or our 50th, and luck would've been the largest determining factor.  We ONE-SHOT every boss this week in Hyjal, BT to reliquary, TK25 - yet archimonde on our second kill is nearing 30 or more pulls.  I'd love for the devs to join a raid and see this shit in action, especially being at 12% with no mistakes and being instagibbed because of some ridiculous timer.  Like I said though, its highly unlikely this encounter will be retuned; they tend to let showstoppers remain on the "end" bosses.  <br>
<br>
Any encounter where you can do everything right, and still die, is dumb.  Especially when there are many ways for that to happen here.  Randomness should be parts of the encounter, but they should not BE the encounter.  I hate this fight now, it is absolute ass... (I used to like it less than a week ago).</div>

It is definetly possible to avoid 99% of the deaths but its just way to random. I dont see any learning curve when trying him, ist just a try-after-try until you get lucky and kill him. Its just annoying to have hours of trys after having killed him 3 times already...</div>

The funny part was that most of the people had already released and didnt get any Rep.<br>
<br>
It is definetly possible to avoid 99% of the deaths but its just way to random. I dont see any learning curve when trying him, ist just a try-after-try until you get lucky and kill him. Its just annoying to have hours of trys after having killed him 3 times already...</div>

</div>Yeah the problem for us was we were at 12% with no deaths, no doomfires, no gribs, and he hit everyone for 80k.  Sadly the Spirit of redemptions weren't able to do the last 2%.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Not to go against your frustration but isn't this more about removing the parry mechanic than the use of fear on a boss?<br>
I understand being aggravated over the combination of the 2 but going as far as saying Blizzard isn't allowed to equip a boss with fear ever again seems a bit exaggerated.<br>
<br>
Maybe I'm biased being a shaman and feeling useful thanks to class specific abilities (tremor).<br>
Still Archimonde fears and there are ways to deal with it. This parry stuff seems more problematic to me.</div>

</div>Curious, but why don't you consider having an uncrushed feral druid with double the armor, double the dps, and triple the aggro, and zero chance of being feared just as problematic?<br>
<br>
I believe the devs mentioned fear would never be a determining or large factor on bosses in the past, which is why a lot of people bring it up - but people should know better... look at resist fights, same thing going on there.  If you removed fear from archimonde it would be a better fight, but then it would be too "easy."  Hence the suggestions listed previously in how to fix the encounter.  Basically fixing how the abilities overlap would solve a lot of issues.</div>

		<div id="post_message_421298">The fear issue is much higher than the other issues, although if it were to be made as a 3 second fear I don't think anyone would have any issues. The fact it's 1.0 seconds which means it's shorter than a GCD means that the tank has to save cooldown for switch+zerk once ~25 seconds have gone after the fear. Due to the fear having no maximum cooldown (apparently - we've gone for at least 60 seconds without a fear which is ridiculous) it means that threat generation is absolutely gimp because all you can use is HS and shield block.<br>
<br>
The parry mechanic is just stupid in general really. I can understand "a" parry increasing attack speed, but having chain-parries continuously affecting weapon speed to the point where it can practically instagib your MT with JUST default attacks is stupid.</div>

Random Melee A gets feared, runs forward (tremor takes one second to tick if the shaman's really good) and Archimonde bursts him. A goes wheeeee. Alright, you might say. That's perfectly reasonable. <br>
<br>
But! Because he ran forward, the burst's AoE effect catches the MT as well, sending him flying ~100m upwards and back. The MT moves faster than Archimonde's run speed, which leaves Archimonde with nothing in melee range. He fingers, raid dies, lulz are had by all. :P</div>

<br>
A 10 minute enrage in that fight is absolutely okay IMO. It's straight forward tank 'n' spank though with a lot of movement for the raid. No adds whatsoever which could prevent your damage dealers from killing him faster. Sure, more healers are nice when his punts go really badly or several people catch fire. Though the fight is about avoiding such situations and stacking healers is just a workaround for not proper execution.<br>
<br>
On the other hand I agree that the whole encounter is too unforgiving to be considered well-balanced or fun. Trying him is like what Sapphiron used to be - go in, wipe, go again, wipe again, repair and so on... I think I never spent that much gold for repairs in such a short time.</div>

		<div id="post_message_421456">Eh, Archimonde is kind of like Sapphiron without world buffs and without needing resist gear, but Sapphiron really wasn't nearly as random.  You could get "bad" ice block placement, but you could adapt your strat to account for that.   <br>
<br>
The problem with Archimonde is that he really does have "you lose" scenarios, even if they're relatively unlikely.  Obviously the better your execution, the more you can get away with, but there are impossible situations that the RNG can give you.  People have timers, like pots, trinket, racials, etc., to get them out of bad situations, but if those situations arise repeatedly, there's really no recourse.  If someone gets Burst --&gt; Grip in midair --&gt; Fear once knocked away from any tremor totems, if they can break the fear and pot/heal they have a chance, but if they have no way of breaking the fear, and get feared away from any decursers who might themselves be able to break the fear, that person is going to die.  Or maybe they miraculously survive it once, but then it happens again.  Or someone has a Fear --&gt; Doomfire --&gt; Burst --&gt; Grip combo.  That's pretty much always going to kill someone, and it's not always avoidable.</div>

</div>i think it's more the point that during sapphiron poor performing players getting "oops i wasn't behind the ice block" still could lead to a win, where similar poor performance on archimonde generally leads to a wipe<br>
<br>
edit: and what gurgthok said, sapphiron had very few "you lose" buttons compared to archimonde, although 1 side could get all 5 ice blocks, the odds we're pretty small compared to the chance of a bad combo grip/doomfire/fear/airburst</div>

</div>I remember group-healers (priests) dying and shortly after that their whole group would be dead. Or decursers would die and the the curse would heal Sapphiron more everytime while more people were dying from its additional damage. Sure you still could Soulstone and Combat Rez those people back then and make up for poor play with more buffs. But every death hurt you a lot on that fight already. I guess Archimond is like Sapphiron with a big portion of unfairness on top. </div>

</div>Thats pretty much what blizzard seems to be missing from several encounters, and what has been said in this thread a bunch of times.  Internal cooldowns to prevent deaths that are otherwise unpreventable, unfair or unlucky.  <br>
<br>
One fight with a doom was enough, but having statistically unpropable deaths happen because of the way certain abilities are cast and chained is not really well planned.<br>

I wonder if more dev's besides Tigole read these forums, I think they would benefit from reading the boss specific threads that are created here.</div>

I still consider archimonde to be their worst effort for an instance boss.  They get a pass for ragnaros, but this fight is no better designed than viscidus. Reading about an enrage wipe with everyone still alive should (hopefully) really discourage any similar encounters in the future. <br>
<br>
Also as far as guild rules go I think it is fair to demand people show up with the 2 minute pvp trinket. The 5 minute one is nice but in the end the encounter is so random that eventually there will be an attempt where you need to save yourself more than once.<br>
<br>
Also I think the best thing they could do to clean up this fight a little is to not punt targets within   10 yards. Depending on fire and punts, melee can be very effective or nearly worthless on this fight. Removing the punts within 15 yards I think will dramatically improve the encounter.</div>

</div>Saber lash prevents you from being FA'ed? News to me - both me and the other offtank have been FA'ed on a number of Shahraz attempts (I got ported last night while OTing - it would be interesting to see if I'd been lashed in the past 30 seconds or so or if I just had a bit of an avoidance streak).<br>
<br>
Archimonde is definitely a RNG based fight, although it certainly gets cut down a lot if you use a strategy with people grouping up around a decurser for mid-air decurse. It also helps if you have a lot of mages+druids to spread around.</div>

		<div id="post_message_421550">Seriously offensive to who?  These forums have had curse words since long before this thread... and given the fight I don't think the multiple people cursing it are out of line, but hey, whatever.<br>
<br>
The sapphiron comparison is completely unfair.  Sapphirons "5 on one side" frostbolt could be negated to strategy as praetorian said.  As sebudai already mentioned, there isn't another fight in the game with the same level of lotto that is also coupled to being unforgiving.  At this point though its been beaten to death so we should probably move on with comparisons to other fights.  <br>
<br>
Who cares if every fight in the game prior to this one was like this - its a dumb design!  You simply should not be able to die if you do everything correctly - and if they intend you to die in extreme cases, it shouldn't lead to almost a guaranteed wipe.  <br>
<br>
This fight is more like azgalor with dooms, only when the doom goes off he also wipes the raid 25% of the time.  You're sure to win if you keep trying!<br>
<br>
I was hoping the doomfire changes would make the fight more consistent, yet somehow they made it less so... strange.</div>

</div>I'd bet the latter.  If you look at the effect, it places a 30sec debuff on you: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304034910/http://thottbot.com/s40810" target="_blank">Thottbot World of Warcraft: Saber Lash</a><br>

Obviously anecdotal evidence isn't conclusive proof that this is what it does, but I can't come up with any other plausible explanation. It doesn't take much avoidance for it to drop off though -- three dodges in a row will do it, and that's hardly a rare occurrence.</div>

		<div id="post_message_421554">I think what shawn wanted to say is that the fight and everything it involves just feels a lot like sapphiron. You don't have any trash, you can wipe in seconds or after 9 minutes and it wouldn't matter because the mechanics of the encounter stay the same all fight long.<br>
<br>
Of course, sapphiron was a lot less random and a lot more forgiving (still one of the most unforgiving encounters pre - TBC) than archimonde is.<br>
<br>
So much depends on a single person, not just because anyone could screw himself, but the enitre raid with one unnecessery action. There are so many encounter you can go in and someone who plays like 200% can easily overshade a shitty half-heartened 50% gameplay, that's ok. You pull archi, 20 seconds after pull someone's dead and you could do absolutly nothing to save him and the raid wipes, no chance to recover or whatsoever. And it does not matter if someone dies at 95% in a fire or at 15%. You might have just gotten good luck, or bad luck.<br>
<br>
Same with sapphi. You could do so well untill 10% and in a key situation ONE guy might have missed a decurse. Sapphi heals himself, more people die. Chainreaction -&gt; wipe.<br>
<br>
It's kinda hard to explain, since the elements are a lot differend...just the feeling...reminded a lot of us on Sapphiron.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">A 10 minute enrage in that fight is absolutely okay IMO. It's straight forward tank 'n' spank though with a lot of movement for the raid. No adds whatsoever which could prevent your damage dealers from killing him faster. Sure, more healers are nice when his punts go really badly or several people catch fire. Though the fight is about avoiding such situations and stacking healers is just a workaround for not proper execution.</div>

</div>This is a little off-topic from the Archimonde fight as a whole, but I'm a firm believer that hard 10 minute enrages are poor design. They serve their purpose so you don't stack healers, but other than that they make little sense. If a boss can one shot your whole raid with one ability, why doesn't he just do it when you engage him? Mechanics like Gruul's Grow, timed overlapping phases like Kael, and Vashj's sporebats make a lot more sense to me and are a more elegant solution than dropping an arbitrary 10 minute timer on a fight.</div>

Make it 20% if they need it to be reasonably hard.  We generally are on pace for 7-8 minute kills, but you can get doomfire that prevent melee for attacking for literally more than half the fight.  That shouldn't mean you wipe suddenly - there are already enough situational deaths.</div>

		<div id="post_message_421570">Honestly, I really really enjoy the fight.  Even after a hair-tearing-out number of wipes, I still enjoy the mechanics of every single pull.  Fire is definitely avoidable with good movement and judicious use of your PVP trinket, at least early in the fight, and even late in the fight with good movement and awareness it should be the exception rather than the rule.  I've always been a fan of fights that destabilize towards the end -- it's so much more exciting that way. :-)<br>
<br>
As far as things I'd change, there are only three:<br>
- Remove Soul Charge.  Far too often it ends up causing a wipe due to a single death.<br>
- Increase the length of the fight somewhat.<br>
- Make the fear not affect whoever has aggro to minimize FW advantages.<br>
<br>
The second change is really only because if they did the first, it would make the fight far too easy.  The real problem, as others have said, is that a single death often causes another with Soul Charge, and the whole thing quickly snowballs into a wipe.  IMO the fires are fine, the fearing is fine, the airbursting is fine, and the gripping is fine.  Yeah, you're going to  get combos sometimes that cause someone to die and there isn't much you could have done about it.  But people die on bossfights all the time, so that's not a huge deal so long as it doesn't overtly hose the whole raid.<br>
<br>
Given the other mechanics of the fight, the last 10% thing seems kind of pointless.  Presumably it's a check to make sure that you still have enough people standing, but unless you happen to hit it mid-wipe I can't imagine not having the dps for it, and if you lose more than a couple people earlier in the fight it's basically a guaranteed wipe.  As someone pointed out in our raid last night, it IS a good way to finally unleash your rage at Archimonde for wiping you so much, though. :-)<br>
<br>
For those getting airbursted into doomfires -- you can control where you land somewhat based on when you use your tear.  The tear lowers your vertical movement speed but not your lateral, so it seemed to me that you could use it earlier to glide more, or later to "stick the landing".<br>
<br>
Oh, and for those folks that got the lovely grip+airburst combo, our druid officer was actually sporting some rocket boots to jet out and save them.  It was pretty sweet.</div>

</div>While a 10 minute enrage might not be as elegant or interesting as Gruul's grows, it serves the same purpose.  If Al'ar didn't have an enrage timer in phase 2, you could take him down with 2 tanks and a couple healers on Al'ar, a tank and a healer on the adds, and a few dpsers (enough to take down the adds between meteors).  It would take you forever and eventually you'd get overrun with adds, but you could kinda do it.  Now, if any birds you had up exploded after a certain amount of time, caused AoE damage, and didn't take health off Al'ar, I guess that would be more elegant, but it really serves the same purpose.</div>

</div>I think Soul Charge needs to stay. It makes the fight very different, because having someone die is really bad, and has an immediate effect. How many fights end up dragging out forever because a bunch of people die, and then you either limp along to a 20 minute long Lurker or hit an enrage timer? The problem isn't so much that a person dying is a likely wipe, it's that his abilities can interact in ways that make that first death really likely regardless of execution.<br>
<br>
And I agree, FW is absurd on this fight. We force our only dwarf to stay out of shadow form for it </div>

</div>I really, really dislike the different versions of Soul Charge.  Depending on the class that dies, you're either fine or you wipe.  It also makes the fight absolutely maddening to learn, and contributes to a lot of finger pointing and frustration.  I'm not so sure it needs to be removed entirely, but I never much hate the 3 different versions.  The holy priest bug is also wonderful.<br>
<br>
The fight would be hard but a lot more manageable with some small changes to his cooldowns.  It's dumb to have a fight require your tank to stop generating meaningful threat and wait for a fear for 30+ seconds, and pray he doesn't blink at the wrong time on top of that.  Doomfire also seems like a perfect mechanic for them to change in <i>every patch</i> for the rest of eternity, too.</div>

</div>I think it was he came in starting with saying "Some really offensive postings here. You might want to read your angry words again before posting them." then saying what you just said, which I personally disagree with every part of.  Sapphiron once you got to do it right was barely random at all, even with all the blocks on one side, someone dieing meant they did something wrong.  Not having a curse cured meant someone did something wrong.  <br>
<br>
And you could have more deaths in sapphiron if you moved groups around than you could in say Gothik, where a rogue dies to a DK and dead side is overrun, or a tank gets feared when he shouldn't, or the paladin kiting dies on Gluth, Gluth eats and it's over, or invisible void zones, or a tank dies for whatever reason, if your rez isn't up soon it's done.  Sapphiron just had a lot of excuses for deaths that weren't "I was dumb" so people blamed it on being random, and then you lost 5 people to one ice block and wiped.  If one or two people died you were probably fine.  (For reference, we killed Sapphiron with 35 once because we couldn't make a solid 8th group and rather than strech too thin, we just went with 35, went fine, and since there are no mechanics of someone dies, this happens, it's essentially like having 5 people die.)<br>
<br>
Archimonde even though from my point of view as a tank with FW isn't hard, it's still annoying when you hear "wow I just got gripped and feared into a newly spawned doomfire" or something is just annoying.</div>

Obviously anecdotal evidence isn't conclusive proof that this is what it does, but I can't come up with any other plausible explanation. It doesn't take much avoidance for it to drop off though -- three dodges in a row will do it, and that's hardly a rare occurrence.</div>

</div>yeah, in the time frame that I actually took damage from Saberlash. I have never been ported. However, a string of dodge/miss/parry resulting the debuff's wearing off will cause the offtank to be ported.<br>
<br>
With that in mind it is still best to go in high avoidance and armor, since it is already extremely healing intensive fight already.</div>

You know when it happens, top off your raid, put hots on the tank and if nothing bad happens the same second, you can very much survive it. Removing that ability from the fight and being able to CR people or just going on with 20 players would trivialize this fight up to making it easier then the 4th boss.<br>
Very bad idea imho, I was kinda disappointed that Archimonde wasn't harder then it currently is. Same problem with Illidian though. Last boss should not topple over 2-4 days after guilds reach it.</div>

I just really hate the tendency for soul charge to snowball, especially in a fight where deaths can be all-but-unavoidable.

		<div id="post_message_421882">Soul Charge IS the interesting mechanic in the fight though, removing it is just a bandaid fix. Kills would come fast, easy, and one shot every week, but people would still die to random events that are outside of their own control. <br>
Most of it could be solved also with pretty simple coding. Elune's Grace could remove curses/make you immune to Doomfire for 5 seconds, which would easily counteract burst gibs/floating into fire, and allow some more interactivity for people on the ground. <br>
Bam, 90% of the unavoidable deaths are removed, while barely changing the rest of the fight considering the CD and nature of air bursts. <br>
They could easily flat remove parry, and force fears to go off in the 40-45 second range as well,  <br>
the second part which is just an annoyance more than a raid wipe. <br>
<br>
Sapphiron was not an "unforgiving" fight, our first kill we limped by with 20 people up for the last 20%. Even the Four Horsemen really only needed a select few people to play well. Gothik, Thaddius, and Loatheb were far more taxing as a raid leader imo as far as individual performance monitoring/fucking over the rest of the guild (Loatheb just the first kill). On all 3 of those fights the only thing that could remotely compare to the complete idiocy of what goes on during Archimonde sometimes is Thaddius during a lag night though.</div>

		<div id="post_message_421884">The bottom line is, no encounter should have an instant "you lose" button.  Archimonde apparently not only has 1, but many ways in which result in "you lose".<br>
<br>
A few nights ago, we had our off tank get punted (Yes, I know this fight doesn't require an off tank, but we don't have dps issues, so we just run with the same raid and don't swap people out).  Anyway - He got gripped, knock back, and landed in fire.  To make it back to the raid alive, he had to hit shield wall and last stand, and barely made it back.  Any other class would of gibbed if this had happened to them.  <br>
<br>
Basically, doomfire is a fun mechanic, and can be dealth with in many ways.  But the 3 key abilities here are grip / fear / air burt.   If doing one of these abilities put a 6-7 cooldown on doing another one of them, the fight would be much less random. Obviously some of them can be tweaked, for instance, maybe grip only needs a 3 second cooldown on everything else.  If you can't decurse someone in 3 seconds, you are too slow.  Actually, you could probably bring it down to a global 4 second cooldown.  After thinking about it more, it's usually 2-3 abilities within a 2-3 second window that result in death.  Given small windows of time between each ability removes the "you're fucked" mechanic I think.<br>
<br>
I guess it's already been said, but it seems to be the case in many encounters.  Many abilities just need to trigger a global cooldown for mobs.<br>
<br>
EDIT: I also like the suggestion about the tears providing much more functionality.  Maybe there are 2 types of tears, and you can have both.  One for featherfall, and one for decurse/remove fear.  Would put the responsibility in people's hands a lot more.</div>

I still disagree about the fear issues for tanks like I said in the BT/Hyjal thread. I don't see a reason to keep the GCD up and gimping your threat. If they nerf the fear on MT, I might just fall asleep in this fight (Teron Gorefiend comes to mind).<br>
A druid with Fear Ward might be better, but not much, if at all. The difference in damage per swing isn't that big if you factor in blocks and pots as well. They have a lot less avoidance and also take more damage from Doomfire. Unless you have like 3+ Fear Wards in the raid, I wouldn't use it on the tank.</div>

		<div id="post_message_421889">While theres certain situations where death is all but inevitable for someone, its safe to say most deaths/wipes aren't because of "those" situations, very few in fact. Dying is usually avoidable, but people will do one or multiple things wrong beforehand. Personally, the only aspect of the fight I think needs any change is the silencing soul charge, cut off a couple seconds on the duration of this. Perhaps make the fear less random, maybe not timed but its funny seeing a fear go off every 30 seconds then one goes off 2 minutes later, this is unfair to raids not blessed(or cursed) with having fear ward I think. This is coming from a dwarf priest. :P<br>
<br>
This fight is definitely frustrating if you have idiots in your raid though, very VERY frustrating. I feel like we only beat this encounter when we get lucky, "saved" by the bubble you could say.</div>

</div>That would actually solve a ton of problems as well, if melee were never the targets of Air Burst.<br>
Floating into the Doomfire only ever seemed to happen on melee because of natural back limit to the fire. I could definitely live with the increased damage as well, since it's still relatively difficult to enjoy the fight with certain doomfire spawns and air burst combos in chains.</div>

The different-charges-for-different-classes thing would be a cool idea if there was some kind of prioritizing or active decision-making on the part of the raid.  As it is, there's little rhyme or reason to who dies besides some general rules of thumb like "healers can survive better" and "more HP is good."  So why should one debuff in particular (the silence one) be so much worse?  Soul Charge does a good job at punishing sloppiness...its damage on face won't kill anyone, but it has a huge de-stabilizing effect and tends to snowball into more deaths.  It doesn't preclude killing him, just exacts a steep price for mistakes.  That's not necessarily bad...but you are FAR more likely to wipe if you get the Silence debuff, and seeing as his abilities are mostly RSTS I don't see the point of splitting it up by class.</div>

Last night we walk in and one shot Reliquary with new people in the raid, and then wipe all night to Archimonde.   Granted there are a few people who are less than ideal on mobility fights that we have, one of them being a holy priest. (Had no idea about the double soul charge with SoR...

Honestly, until Illidan is totally on farm, I'm starting to debate if it's worth rolling the dice with this guy until everything else in BT/Hyjal, and maybe even TK/SSC is dead. <br>

		<div id="post_message_422162">This is my most hated fight of Tier 6 so far. <br>
<br>
The 1 second fear as the tank is frustrating, since I have to go into low-aggro mode when the timer is up. Sometimes he delays his fear significantly (as long as 1.5 minutes, once) and I'm forced to chill in low aggro mode waiting for that fear to happen (although you can throw in a shield slam/revenge when he does an airbust).<br>
<br>
The fears/tremor make it feel like Viscidus or 4H in that you're aiming for a very specific comp which you may or may not hit very often, depending on your guild (5 shaman for us would be 100% shaman attendance). We started tonight with 5 shaman and were making very good progress on the encounter for our first night. Once we went down to 4, and eventually 3 shaman, we got worse and worse. At the end we were trying to stack our 2 non-shaman groups with BM hunters and multiple dispellers who can alternate off using trinket+dispels. Even with that, it felt like a losing battle.<br>
<br>
Air burst is actually the easiest part of the fight and I think people in general have no problems with this. We have had a few issues with peoples Tears disappearing, even though they didn't zone out, and when no one elses had disappeared. "Uhh.. oh shit.. oh shit.. fffff - my item is gone dude!". We did lose a couple people who got airbursted to the well, then feared down to the bottom and cursed while feared. Pretty much instant death there.</div>

		<div id="post_message_422170">I can't imagine the fight with a decent amount of shaman.  We tried it one night before the doomfire change, only for a few attempts, and we've spent *a lot* of time on it now.  One night with a single shaman.  A long Saturday with 2 shaman, and then tonight with 2 shaman.  A lot of things we can work on, but the fight is so grueling to be honest.  Sometimes we get 2-3 attempts in in a 10 minute span, other times we have solid dice rolls + better play and communication and do very well.  It's a fight that feels a lot like Thaddius on original hardware to us, kinda.  Either way, I both hate and enjoy the fight, but feel soul charge is a bit steep in that it almost ensures another death, and so on.  If old doomfire was "easy mod", I can't imagine this boss being quite as bad as it is now.  Our best is a few 40% attempts, but nothing to seal the deal this week.  While a death simply doesn't mean a wipe, it sure attributes to it a great deal, and often will cause the death.</div>

</div>I can confirm it.  A couple weeks ago we had the death chain start around 20%, and had 4 people standing when he hit 10%.  We burned him down to 7% in the next ~40 seconds and then he keeled over.<br>
<br>
And yeah, the fight does seem a bit on the ridiculous side now, 30+ attempts to get him down again this week (although I'll concede some of those should've been kills if it weren't for mistakes).</div>

</div>When someone gets rezzed in the instance, the Tear poofs.  So basically just have everyone run back every time.<br>

I detest this fight.  We only got to him this reset so we've never seen the old Archimonde.  The last 2 days have been amazingly demoralizing.  We've made decent progress in Hyjal/BT up till now and this fight just hit us like a brick wall.  I'm glad this thread is here so we can at least see that we're not the only guild having issues with this encounter.  For now I hope we direct our efforts to BT as I don't think our time is being spent very productively slamming our heads against this fight.</div>

		<div id="post_message_422179">We finally got him again - 11% berserk wipe (people were screaming in pain like you can't imagine; it was amazing), and a 10% clean kill.  The number of times I got instagibbed tonight was just shocking - lots of parries, fears followed by a 4-5 seconds to get 20k damage.  The 4-5 second kills are definitely controllable, especially through hots, but many of the gibs simply were not.  A parry during a fear is really brutal.  <br>
<br>
You get exceptionally good at this fight after 50 pulls - but the random factors will still determine if you're going to win.  Winning makes me feel better about it, but I still stand firmly by the changes needed a few pages back that I posted.  Yech.<br>
<br>
BTW, die in doomfires - no durability (already stated, in case anyone missed).</div>

		<div id="post_message_422183">The fact that he drops 151 loot makes it painful to consider letting his loot rot, but then again it's equally painful to wipe to him 151 times (exaggeration, yes) while BT is still open. <br>
<br>
When we got Archimonde down the week before the patch, I predicted that next week we'd have a hell of a time getting him down again. Sometimes I hate being right.<br>
<br>
We did get him down, but only because of quick ad-libbing and good luck on the part of some of our raiders, such as a fury war getting burst into a fire and switching to def. stance and shield walling just as fear hit, rogues sprinting through doomfire to jump into the well, and our MT getting into a parrying contest with Archimonde (no less than 5 consecutive parries from both parties involved). So much dependance on CDs being up and pure dumb luck it isn't even remotely amusing. :P<br>
<br>
Definitely NOT looking forward to going through all of this again next week.</div>

		<div id="post_message_422190">If this fight had trash (waves or respawns) or a lengthy c'thun-esque CR, I would probably have canceled my account tonight. Most of our wipes are still due to player error, but the occasional impossible to prevent death-wipe just makes me lose faith in the developers, I mean seriously. There are a lot of excellent suggestions in this thread and i'm sure there are dozens of ways they could hotfix the encounter that would get rid of the random factor and still maintain the level of difficulty it currently has (which is just fine).<br>
<br>
Also, thanks for the info about the disappearing tears. We had a couple wipes due to that and I couldn't understand why it happened.</div>

		<div id="post_message_422194">I honestly don't see the huge amount of randomness that others seem too. I'd guess 90%+ of all wipes are because someone messed up, with the other 10% being bad luck. It's just on this fight that one mistake someone makes is much more fatal. One thing I can agree on is the punishment for death is abit harsh. The silence charge will almost garuntee a wipe, the other two you can deal with to a lesser extent, but still when one person does end up dieing its almost always a chain reaction. Soul Charge should not be removed though.<br>
<br>
If people try to do the fight like pre-patch (standing behind him) then I can see why they would struggle, the amount of fire damage taken was huge when we tried that the first time after the patch. Spreading groups out around him was much easier, and alot less fire damage taken by the whole raid.<br>
<br>
The only thing I would like to see changed is his fear to be more predictable, make it go off between every 35-40 secs and the aggro problem will be fixed.</div>

		<div id="post_message_422201">We actually half jokingly half seriously told our MT to just not do anything during fears tonight after he got gibbed by parries far too many times during them.<br>
<br>
Overall, with our first kill being tonight, I don't think the fight is too horrendous in terms of design.  We had two deaths on our kill (Shaman and warrior), and were able to pull through, but at the same time, those two deaths were considerably spaced apart, and the shaman came early on so casters were more able to adapt to the sudden loss of 3000 mana.<br>
<br>
The maddening things about the 'unavoidable' deaths (which we had quite a few of, and even more totally and easily avoidable deaths that people wanted to pin on unavoidability) is that they really aren't totally unavoidable, it's just the perfect reactions and snap decisions necessary      to survive some of them are just too precise for most/all people to make on the fly.  After someone died, we could of course look back and come up with the perfect course of action that would have saved them, but at the time it just wasn't gonna happen.  I dunno, I love the fight to death, but there just seems to be something wrong with it, even if the 10% beat down felt oh so good.</div>

		<div id="post_message_422205">They should let the Doomfire be a lot more controllable, but still have the potential to do significant raidwide damage. For example, say Archimonde turns toward a specific person and fires off that doomfire at them - there's no random retargetting or swirling, it's just at them.<br>
That person's job then is to run the fire away from the raid so nobody takes damage. Fears into the fires could still happen, but I'd rather take someone getting feared through a doomfire someone ran out than someone getting feared through 3 rows.<br>
<br>
I don't have problems with the Doomfire itself, honestly. If I could, I'd want every doomfire chasing me during the fight - once you get it down it's easy to control. You can run it where you want, you can cut away from it and let it run its course, and you can make it a non-issue. The problem is you don't know where it's going to spawn and people just don't pay attention. "Well, the doomfire wasn't going toward me so I didn't move, but then it turned around and targetted me so I ran it through the melee in a giant ring."</div>

		<div id="post_message_422209">Yeah we spent the last two nights re-learning the encounter and probably wiped about 50 times before we finally got him tonight. The fight is pretty ridiculous right now and I'm sure it will see more tuning.<br>
<br>
I had a death tonight in which I was Air Bursted and hit with a mid-air Grip. I healthstone mid-air, click my Tears, land and take <u>zero</u> fall damage, immediately start running towards a nearby druid who lands a cure on me but the server doesn't recognize it in time and 1 second later I take the fatal tick of damage from Grip. <b>Ridiculous</b>.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I think the current version of the fight is all about avoiding Doomfire. You're going to wipe to ridiculous shit every once in a while, maybe even 50% of the time, so you have got to control the damage your raid is taking from Doomfire to give your raid a chance the other 50% of the time.<br>
<br>
Doomfire causes the majority of deaths on this encounter. Wether it's from Doomfire + Air Burst, Doomfire + Grip, Doomfire + Fear, Doomfire + Air Burst + Grip + Fear or whatever. Doomfire is almost always involved. Infact the main reason Soul Charge is so devestating is because usually there are a bunch of people at half life from Doomfire.<br>
<br>
Tonight my raid was just taking way too much damage from Doomfire. I kept stressing how important it was for people to prioritize avoiding it above all else, but it didn't sink in until our last attempt in which I channeled the motivational speaker within and went on a 10 minute curse word laced rant about Doomfire. On our next attempt the raid literally took 1/3 the amount of Doomfire damage that we had been averaging each attempt during the last two nights. Some people took as little as 1/5 of what they had been averaging.<br>
<br>
So, that's my take on the current encounter. The goal of any raid leader should be to get your raid to understand how bad Doomfire is. Classes like warlocks and hunters just need to get the hell out of the way, because if they take too many Doomfires the raid is literally better off raiding with 1 less person. It's just as bad if healers get it too, because if a healer takes too many Doomfires they are literally in the raid to heal themselves. I don't care if a non-decurser/non-healer has to run 100 yards away and do nothing for 30 seconds just to avoid Doomfire. It is just not acceptable for them to get the debuff if they can avoid it in someway. If they were feared into it they were standing too close to it, simple as that.<br>
<br>
Melee do the brunt of the damage on this encounter, and the one good thing about the Doomfire change is it usually isn't very hard for melee to avoid it, especially if your rogues are undead. The goal of all non-melee dps classes is to just not be a liability. Put your curse or hunters mark on the mob and then <i>don't take damage</i>. Deal as much damage as you can but do not risk taking damage at any point. Period.</div>

That's also part of the luck factor in the fight I hate though.<br>
2 11-12% wipes (berserk timer hit at 10 minutes, instant raid death) with perfect control but terrible doomfires and Air Bursts on melee, versus the 7 minute kill with 1-2 Air Bursts on melee and virtually no melee unfriendly doomfire.<br>
I know that it's obviously not a big deal, but it definitely can add up.</div>

</div>I think this pretty sums up my feelings as well. The attempt right before our kill I had the most unimaginable thing happen to me. I got cursed, followed with an airburst, followed by landing in doomfire, followed by getting recursed after landing on the ground.<br>
<br>
Needless to say I died and caused a wipe, after downing a potion/healthstone and getting a decurse before I was airbursted.. I really don't see what else could have been done to save me.</div>

I have to say, some of the deaths that seem random are very preventable. Most of the raid should be topped throughout the fight, taking little damage. Definitely a fight where you want to put on as much health as possible to minimize luck.<br>
<br>
The fight is ALL about controlling the Doomfires, awareness of the Doomfires, and avoidance of the Doomfires. Every time a Doomfire touches someone, it's like taking a healer out of the fight for 45 seconds. When you run out of healers, someone is going to die.<br>
<br>
The Doomfire is pretty controllable, though - once you understand the basic ways it moves and seems to select targets. You can usually lead them away from the raid pretty successfully. You REALLY need to impress on people that it's much more important to lead their Doomfire away from the raid, taking themselves out of the fight for 30 seconds, than it is to let themselves get touched by it, taking a healer out of the fight effectively  for 45 seconds.<br>

		<div id="post_message_422243"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Doomfire doesn't just chase 1 person.  It can spawn in the north and chase someone in the south, and then change targets again entirely.  <br>
<br>
It will also be 5 yards from someone and then randomly veer off into the abyss.  Basically you can do something to control it, but doomfire in and of itself is random beyond a slight preference to chase people.  Learning to corral it is relatively important, but just running away is basically the key.  <br>
<br>
Yeah you shouldn't run it into other people, and yeah you should avoid it.  Being almost 180 degrees away from the nearest doomfire works rather well (our entire raid constantly moves - and near the end provided us with the most "consistency"), but thats not the rub with the fight - having the combination of events will happen on almost every pull, if it results in a death that in and of itself will likely doom you.  <br>
<br>
If all goes well and none of the above describe circumstances happen, yeah its not a hard fight. But a kill could just as well be a wipe, and then you might now wipe for another 2 hours until you get lucky again.  A lot of guilds go 90, 80, 90, 60, 70, kill; then repeat the same sequence next week - thats how we've done it at least, and how I've heard other guilds doing it.  I'm not convinced that is due to people trying harder as much as just something bad not happening in the first third of the fight.  <br>
<br>
Basically the problem is you can have unavoidable deaths - you can have deaths that are avoidable but likely going to kill someone anyway, and any of those deaths is often a wipe due to the punishing mechanic.  Unavoidable deaths that cause a wipe is dumb, Unavoidable deaths are dumb, situations of overlapping timers that provide unfair circumstances are dumb, fear ward is dumb.  Archimonde could be one of the best fights in TBC, but it suffers from serious tuning issues.  If people are happy with shit like this encounter you'll eventually find yourself playing a single player game honestly.  Too often people get a kill and call it OK after the fact; a lot of the TBC encounters needed serious work, and this one is no exception - I'm willing to bet shahraz is the same, but the rest seem decent.  If we could have a world of bloodboils and gorefiends and reliquaries instead of archimondes and solarians and vashj 1.0 and gruuls the raid game would be 100 times better for it.  Most of these fights require a 0 after a 1 to be fixed, and archimonde is no exception; from my experience, tuning is more important than encounter design to making something fun.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
Our first night (About 1.5h) went basically as you described, 90, 90, 70, 90, 50, 90, 80.. you get the pattern.<br>
<br>
Our second night was a little more controlled, with basically all attempts within the 65-80% range, with a few in the 30-50.<br>
<br>
Our third night, which happened to be our kill night, was consistently 20-40% for hours. What we basically ended up changing was "preparing" for deaths. We knew they were coming, so we changed everyones mentality from "Deaths = wipes" to "Deaths = Bandage, prepare healthstone + potion, and stop DPS to survive".<br>
<br>
It is of note, that we bring plenty of hybrids. Two elemental shaman, 1 enh shaman, a moonkin, and feral druid. So when we take those hybrids and throw them into healing mode. It certainly helps but obviously not every guild has this option.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I think you're putting too much emphasis on controlling them.  It's pretty random to most people, so just avoid it?  It doesn't move quick, just turn 90 degrees if you're being "chased"  and you'll be fine.  You should never be feared into one if you keep in mind when the fear can possibly go off.  Also, your pvp trinket and 10.5k health should be manditory.  <br>
<br>
Quigon:  I'd suggest tallying up who the first death is.  In the 2 guilds I've been in for TBC, it's always been the same people who die first.  I'll admit I died for dumb reasons on Archimonde (feared into the fire with no pvp trinket on, forgot to click tears etc.) and being called out helped.  I have yet to mess up on Archimonde since.  If you don't do it now you'll be doing it for Mother Shahraz and it's harder to spot without fraps.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>The 2 bolded parts are absolutely ridiculous assertions.<br>
<br>
There is NOTHING we can do about what direction Doomfire decides to take.  None.  If you think there is, please, show me FRAPS or something where you 100% of the time steer it where you want to.  The simple fact is, it does what it wants, and the players HAVE NO CONTROL over it.  You can run directly away from Arch, and the fire might follow you, or it might decide that it wants to loop around the Shadow Priest you just ran by, or any number of possible routes.<br>
<br>
There is NOTHING we can do about when he feels like using his abilities, or on whom.  Grip has a 50k(Anywhere) range, Fear has a 99yd range, and Air Burst has a 60yd (EL) range.  Outranging is only really feasible with Air Burst, and, ironically, Air Burst is the only one that can really be controlled in the sense of how many people it hits.<br>
<br>
So, we have 4 <i>completely random</i> abilities, and you're saying the fight is all about controlling these abilities?  No, no I'm sorry, but that's simply false.<br>
<br>
Survival is key, and pretty much the only thing that any participant in this encounter can hope to do.  Stay near a shaman, stay near a healer, and for the love of all that's holy, don't get the stupid Doomfire debuff.<br>
<br>
All that being said, even after wiping to it for what felt like forever these last 2 days, I enjoy the fight from a healing perspective <!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_422780"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->As a rogue, I'd say I have it easier than many people to survive on this fight (debatably...you could argue that warriors, healers, warlocks, decursers and BM hunters have it just as easy due to more fear breaks or better survivability, so almost every other class) but I can say with 100% certainty that the only times I have ever died on this fight have either been intentional (doomfire as the raid wipes), stupid and easily fixable (probably once ever), or to Archimonde smacking me in the face after the tank dies. Unavoidable deaths really are ONLY when a single person gets doomfired, cursed and air bursted while the decurser in the back is far away decursing someone else, and that happens probably about 5% or less of attempts. <br>
<br>
It's my opinion that poor play is practically the sole cause for death on this encounter, and the reason it seems so random is that the standard for what is considered to be smart play is raised substantially higher for this fight than for most others in the game.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_422816"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Totally agree about avoiding Doomfire being the key for those pulls where you don't end up screwed by a random combination (the 50% someone mentioned earlier seems ballpark right to me).<br>
<br>
Before about 60%, no one should be dying to a Doomfire.  Hell, no one should be getting Doomfire at all, especially if you have a dwarf priest or two at your disposal.  FW everyone you can pre-pull, so the first fear is handled, then you should have your PVP trinket if you get a bad "b-line towards the doomfire" fear, but if you position yourself far enough away from the fire those are pretty unlikely.  <br>
<br>
The only time most folks (well, at least the ranged folks, I don't have experience being in melee range) should be eating a Doomfire is late in the fight when they need to take a risky position and their trinket's on cooldown.  The effect is even pretty forgiving -- you turn red and burny for a few seconds before the debuff hits you, so you can do a last-second 90-degree juke if necessary.<br>
<br>
Having enough decursers around so that people are free to position themselves more safely away from the fire helps too, of course.  I would generally try to get back to my home position, but would never risk getting too close to a Doomfire to do so.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Nope, he was paying attention to hitting his potion instead of breaking fear. I'd bet anything he didn't switched to zerker in time and got feared in defensive.<br>
<br>
Dawts is right, however I will add that it's risky using GCD's considering the worst case scenario is hitting and ability right as he casts fear so that you break it after you've been feared for .5ish seconds. This can cause him to whomp a melee that resisted/wotf/deathwished the fear, but if he ever heads to a ranged he will NEVER make it to them assuming you actually got feared in zerker.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>It's especially risky for someone with 350ish latency. If I start stance dancing 0.5 seconds into Archimonde's fear cast, it's pretty much guaranteed I'll never switch stances. Even if my GCD is up and I begin stance dancing immediately when fear begins casting, I still get feared for an extremely small amount of time... fortunately not enough to actually have him switch agro. I have to keep my eyes glued to WitchHunt and my finger over the Zerker Stance button if I'm to catch a fear. I'm probably being a bit too careful, but for the sake of learning it's fine.<br>
<br>
In regard to all the other things said in this thread, I agree that 99% of deaths are avoidable, but that doesn't change the fact that this encounter is simply not fun in its current form. Even the best players make tiny mistakes, and on Archimonde that could easily mean a wipe. PvP trinkets being a near requirement for a PvE instance is laughable. A tiny tweak like being immune to Air Burst when you have Grip of the Legion would make it much more repeatable. I also like the idea of adding more functionality to Tears of the Goddess.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">The 2 bolded parts are absolutely ridiculous assertions.<br>
<br>
There is NOTHING we can do about what direction Doomfire decides to take.  None.  If you think there is, please, show me FRAPS or something where you 100% of the time steer it where you want to.  The simple fact is, it does what it wants, and the players HAVE NO CONTROL over it.  You can run directly away from Arch, and the fire might follow you, or it might decide that it wants to loop around the Shadow Priest you just ran by, or any number of possible routes.<br>
<br>
There is NOTHING we can do about when he feels like using his abilities, or on whom.  Grip has a 50k(Anywhere) range, Fear has a 99yd range, and Air Burst has a 60yd (EL) range.  Outranging is only really feasible with Air Burst, and, ironically, Air Burst is the only one that can really be controlled in the sense of how many people it hits.<br>
<br>
So, we have 4 <i>completely random</i> abilities, and you're saying the fight is all about controlling these abilities?  No, no I'm sorry, but that's simply false.<br>
<br>
Survival is key, and pretty much the only thing that any participant in this encounter can hope to do.  Stay near a shaman, stay near a healer, and for the love of all that's holy, don't get the stupid Doomfire debuff.<br>
<br>
All that being said, even after wiping to it for what felt like forever these last 2 days, I enjoy the fight from a healing perspective </div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>It's pretty obvious that the abilities are random but that doesn't mean you can't do anything about it.  Cursed while air bursted, you can purification pot.  Getting feared into doomfire, you can PvP trinket (make everyone get a 2 minute trinket).  Air bursted at low hp with a doomfire dot already on you, you can fire pot/healthstone.  Cursed after an air burst while you're 100 yards away from the raid, purification pot.  Yeah, I can see how this fight would be a lot more ridiculous if you didn't have any consumables at your disposal, but you do, and you need to use them.  Now, what if one of these terrible scenarios happens and ALL of your shit is on cooldown?  Ok, then you wipe.  But if you can save one "oh shit" scenario per person every 2 minutes your chances of wiping go way, way down.<br>
<br>
All that being said, this fight sucks.  A lot.  I can deal with random shit happening that will kill one person and its uncontrollable.  I can deal with unforgiving fights that mean one person dying = wipe.  But putting those two together is just stupid and makes the encounter not fun at all.<br>

</div>I don't know if this was just ridiculous luck, but I didn't save my globals for fear the entire night while tanking him.  I just mashed my zerk stance zerker rage as soon as I got feared, and I was on global almost every single time, yet he never killed anyone.  I'd get feared in berserker stance, break it like 0.5s or 1s later, and then he was back on me.  I'm not going to go as far as to say there's definitely something in the fight that prevents him from killing anyone during this time, but I'm fairly certain there is (maybe fear cast reset his swing timer?).

		<div id="post_message_423042"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Looks can be deceiving, that's exactly what happens to our melee if I'm feared and they resist.  Unless they're expecting to get hit, that is.<br>
<br>
The point is that it's not particularly hard to hold aggro on him even if you're only using abilities off of the gcd after your berserker rage cooldown comes up.  The reason is cooperation.  On our kill, one warrior assisted me with his debuffs, which improved my threat dramatically (obviously, because he can't crush, a warrior can focus on putting out threat that is well above-average).  Meter at 10% showed me at nearly double the threat of the nearest person.  Was it 100% accurate?  Doubtful, but that's more than enough to hang your hat on when you're worried about losing aggro.  And the only time I was ever on gcd outside of the fear cooldown is when he was in mid cast, period.<br>
<br>
I want to emphasize that this is not intended to be boastful, but if one person can basically assist you in ensuring that every fear is an immune instead of a break, without any chance of losing aggro, I'll take that as being the safer route.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">It's pretty obvious that the abilities are random but that doesn't mean you can't do anything about it.  Cursed while air bursted, you can purification pot.  Getting feared into doomfire, you can PvP trinket (make everyone get a 2 minute trinket).  Air bursted at low hp with a doomfire dot already on you, you can fire pot/healthstone.  Cursed after an air burst while you're 100 yards away from the raid, purification pot.  Yeah, I can see how this fight would be a lot more ridiculous if you didn't have any consumables at your disposal, but you do, and you need to use them.  Now, what if one of these terrible scenarios happens and ALL of your shit is on cooldown?  Ok, then you wipe.  But if you can save one "oh shit" scenario per person every 2 minutes your chances of wiping go way, way down.<br>
<br>
All that being said, this fight sucks.  A lot.  I can deal with random shit happening that will kill one person and its uncontrollable.  I can deal with unforgiving fights that mean one person dying = wipe.  But putting those two together is just stupid and makes the encounter not fun at all.</div>

</div>Everything you mentioned is a <i>counter-reaction</i> to the combination of abilities, not control of said abilities, which is what his post implied, particularly 'controlling Doomfire' routes, which is laughable to even suggest. <br>
<br>
I really enjoy this fight.  I won't lie.  Call me sadistic, call me a liar, whatever.  I think that T6 content, particularly the last boss of one of the T6 zones <b>should</b> be difficult, maybe even to the point of completely unforgiving.  I know a lot of people have been secretly longing for a an encounter that isn't a guaranteed one-shot every week, that adds a bit of pressure to the time spent engaging the mob.  For heaven's sake, this is ARCHIMONDE!  Lore-lol aside, he's <i>got</i> to be hard, he <i>has</i> to test your entire raid to it's limits.  If anything, I think Blizz has given us some leeway, allowing us to have 90% perfect execution, as not all the Soul Charges = wipe (well, once they fix the SoR bug).<br>
<br>
Yes, it's frustrating, and I wanted to pound my face through a wall several times this last week.  Hell, I wasn't even there for our kill this week!  But loot be damned, it felt nice to log on, ask if Arch was dead, and be greeted with a 'Fuck yeah!'.  I like that feeling, that's what drives the community's need to progress, and I think Archimonde, now, is well represented in WoW progression.<br>

		<div id="post_message_423149"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I think part of what you're seeing with the fears is the classic Gluth scenario.  I don't know a better boss to compare it to but main tanks doing switches on him have to know what I'm talking about.<br>
<br>
If I wanted to lose my mortal wounds debuff I could wait for the fear, he would agro the offtank and as long as I did * NOTHING * he would stick on the offtank as long as I wanted him to.  When I wanted agro back I could do anything, blood rage, 1 melee swing, etc and he'd be right back on me.<br>
<br>
MOB AI reacts very strangely in regards to crowd control spells so I find it very understandable that people have varying experiences with it.  One thing you could tell your dps warriors/undead rogues/etc is to hold half a second on breaking their fear, unless they simply must break it because they are heading straight for a doomfire.  Even then, tell them NOT to attack for a second or so to make sure that the main tank lets archimonde know that he is still there.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_423157"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->You are right about Gluth, you could just stand there with way higher threat than the other tank and he would still ignore you. A lot of mobs show this behavior when it comes to fear; Lord Sanguinar, pretty sure Nightbane does it, even the champions in Slave Pens will not return to you until you take an action after you got out of their fear.<br>
However, Archimonde is different. He will bounce back right after you hit Berserker Rage, no further actions required. That is as long as your threat is high enough, which it should be. You still need to beat the next highest person, usually by 110%, because Archimonde's melee range is quite large.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_423192"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->In my experience Gluth eventually came back even if you were trying your best to do nothing :P  Made for some exciting kills.  It could be the zonewide combat mechanic at work there, and in this encounter as well.<br>
<br>
The problem here is that the fear is resistable, and I think that the only reliable "defense" against a slow fear break is having him get on a ranged attacker or someone that can take that one potential hit before he is back under control.  Unless I'm missing your point Dots, that defense shouldn't be neccessary, but I'm just not seeing what you describe.  If I got feared, he was definitely not inactive and seemed to be immediately choosing a target (can tell this right off simply because he moves, he's either turning towards his next target or taking a step away from his position).  But, no log proof and you could just as easily be correct.  I prefer to break the fear as it is cast all the same so that it has no chance to become a problem.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>This week, our MT was feared with a late break. Archimonde chased down our down our DPS warrior 40+ yards out, and Archimonde didn't respond to CS / BS / BR from the MT, much less no action. DPS warrior equipped shield, defensive, and shield wall, and our MT reaggroed with a single melee swing.<br>
<br>
Anecdotal, but we've definitely had melee gibs, even though we've decided to do our best to not have our MT on GCD.<br>

</div>For anyone looking to learn from this thread, we believe this to not be true, outside of talents. Being groups without a Shaman, the first thing that came to mind was to wear SR. No amount of damage gear would make up for what I could do if not feared. However, SR didn't help resists whatsoever.<br>
<br>
Nonetheless, going into fear, tremor can tick sooner than an MT on GCD. This will present the exact scenario you've described.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_423416"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Archimonde does not come back to you unless you do some aggro ability - sometimes changing stances is enough - but sometimes I have to battle shout, or even once had to physically hit him - and keeping rend up seems silly.  Every fear and cc in the game works like this - they did not recode the game just for archimonde.  What you're seeing is that he has a grace period after the fear before changing and requiring a kick back through aggro - most mobs have this as well!  Nightbane did for instance.  <br>
<br>
We've had 3-4 melee die when the enhancement shamans tremor totem pulses during the 0.5 to 1.0 second I'm feared on global, and that is generally a wipe.  I mean the totem will pulse 15% or so of the time you're feared on global, so why risk it?<br>
<br>
Dots, simply because you haven't experienced it doesn't mean its not true... he behaves the same as any other fearing mob in the game - and melee can be instagibbed even if you get the stance switch on time - how do I know this?  Because its happened to us more than once when I'm on the GCD.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_423426"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->There are a lot of things that can be said about this fight and how unfair it is and someone can be killed while everyone play good but to be honest i dont think so or at least at about95% of the time. When someone died than either he or some other member in the raid made mistake. Quite a lot people complain about grip+air burst (in this order not air burst + grip) and i cant understand how is this possible because in most of the cases when someone is air bursted i have time to land 1,5 sec heal before said person is out of range. How can be imposible to decurse him than?<br>
<br>
Yesterday for all 4 attempts before we killed him we had one dead because of the doomfire that can be count as unavoidable and that was me when i was air bursted then feared in doomfire while i was far away from tremor totem and had pvp trinket on cd (to be honest if i had pvp trinket with 2 min cd i would be able to use it but i am too much of a pve tard  ) and with next fear i ran i another doomfire and ofcourse i died. All other deads were because someone made mistake or for example a priest died because he tried to go between two doomfires and he didn't take in account a bit larger area that they cover.<br>
<br>
About the people that hit enrage timer you need to find why you have so low dps. Is it because you have aggro problems or because you dont have enough dps? Because with 9 healers (8 healers and a moonkin on decurse+heal job) and 4 deads (one at 39% and other 3 in about 15-20%) we hit 10% 7 min into the fight.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_423432"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->We've kill him in 6 minutes, and hit the berserk with the same group on back to back attempts - if doomfires hover in front of the melee for 75% of the fight, or they get chain airbursted, you're going to hit the enrage.  That is part of the random, and it happens.  <br>
<br>
I basically see a bunch of "we've killed him, we're great, this fight is flawless posts... learn to play."  I just shake my head at the egos here sometimes.  Were you guys happy with the original gruul too? There is nothing random or dumb about that fight! <br>
<br>
I've already said it before - a lot of the problems with this fight are avoidable - but you're going to wipe anyway, because human beings are playing this game.  And you're going to get air bursted into doomfires - you're going to get air burst plus grip combos at inopportune moments almost EVERY pull.  <br>
<br>
News flash: If everyone played like the messiah, guess what, every guild, tomorrow, would clear through Illidan with 1 shots; please forgive the scrubs who haven't yet and still make mistakes.  Archimonde is basically unfair and unforgiving in many ways, and often execution isn't enough to compensate.  We one shot everything we've done so far in BT, everything in Hyjal, everything in TK25 - and wipe countlessly on a farm boss: its dumb.  I just can't for the life of me understand how people are giving this fight a thumbs up unless its just meant to be a post saying "we rule."<br>
<br>
Change the overlapping mechanics and truly remove the unfairness, and leave the rest as is - that is fair right?  That makes sense?  People really want unavoidable deaths, or to pop level 40 potions and gamble that it might save you half the time?  When did "we can kill it, its fine" overcome common sense.  Instagibs on shahraz should be fixed also right?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div><br>
I think the only way people hit the enrage timer is when fire is really bad.  At least that is what happened to us the one time we hit it.  When the melee has to stay out half the fight and ranged is getting chased all over, it can really extend the fight.  <br>

We had no idea the enrage timer was even in.  Weren't really trying to do max dps, just survive.  Even knowing the enrage timer is there, it isn't worth risking dying to do max dps.  Both of our kills have been around 7 min in at 10%.  This is without consumables mostly and not risking death for dps.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_423442"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->First of all i agree that there is some luck in Archimonde fight but is this part of the fight more important than the luck part in fights with Bloodboil, Mother Shahraz even Teron Gorefiend? At Bloodboil fight you can have 3 mages in a row as targets in p2 and fast stacking debuff on them (hell its not needed to be mages even just fast stacking debuff) and you will wipe period. On Moter Shahraz you can be teleported right into melee or right on MT even and you will wipe. On Teron you can have only healers as spirits and you will lack healing and you will wipe. <br>
<br>
What is the difference from those fight and Archimonde? Its that Archimonde is one of the f*****g ultimate bad guys and he can be very nasty (yea i know that mixing lore and pve balance is not good but sometimes we play this game for fun and we can do our little lore related notes ).<br>
<br>
This fight can be fixed and i think it will but to be honest i think its not the only thing that needs to be fixed in Hijal. For me first thing that needs to be fixed is Azgalor fight and Thrall dieing from rain of fire for example. Its easy to pull boss in a way to not aggro Thrall and you can kill it easy but in this case why is Thrall there? To help you with trash? Or to fight with his big enemies? All in all i dont like whole Hijal instance because its too boring and have too easy bosses that will die from first few pulls for every guild that reach them. Trash is part of the boss fight but at the moment its the bigger part and this is not wath most of us want (or at least i think so).<br>
<br>
For final i just want to apologize to anyone that feel ofended from my posts. Everything i write here is just my personal view how Archimonde encounter works and how you can make it at least a bit more controlable and easy to do.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>We used to drop shadow cauldrons for every attempt. We moved away from that and only use purification pots. Your failure rate is greatly exaggerated.<br>
<br>
The people who die from the curse don't die because they don't get decursed fast enouugh; they die because they don't get decursed at all due to range (usually due to Airburst + Curse combo). The intial airburst, fall damage, and ticks of curse mid air are generally fatal. And that is really the only scenario that someone should really die from the curse. A shadow pot will usually not save them in that scenario.<br>
<br>
Purification pots have proven to be extremely effective and reliable, and we have not had any reported failures in our 4 kills.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I really enjoy this fight.  I won't lie.  Call me sadistic, call me a liar, whatever.  I think that T6 content, particularly the last boss of one of the T6 zones <b>should</b> be difficult, maybe even to the point of completely unforgiving.  I know a lot of people have been secretly longing for a an encounter that isn't a guaranteed one-shot every week, that adds a bit of pressure to the time spent engaging the mob.  For heaven's sake, this is ARCHIMONDE!  Lore-lol aside, he's <i>got</i> to be hard, he <i>has</i> to test your entire raid to it's limits.  If anything, I think Blizz has given us some leeway, allowing us to have 90% perfect execution, as not all the Soul Charges = wipe (well, once they fix the SoR bug).</div>

</div>If we, and by we I mean the high-end raiding community, had not blown through Hyjal, we would not be complaining as much about the difficulty of this encounter. If Archimonde was at the end of Naxxrammas, we would not be complaining as much. I believe that the stark difference in difficulty has brought about much more disdain for this encounter than the mechanics of the encounter itself.<br>
<br>
However, don't get me wrong. I very much feel that Archimonde is entirely too random. Unfortunately this is what makes it hard, and really the only way that blizzard can make encounters more difficult. What do you consider a difficult encounter? And why? I consider Archimonde difficult because it greatly tests both your snap judgement making ability and reaction time. A one second fear is undoubtedly more "difficult" to catch than a two second fear. The definition of difficult is what I'm trying to put in question.<br>
<br>
I think the only way to reasonably nerf Archimonde would be, to harp on what many are saying, create a global cooldown of 5 seconds (or whatever) between his abilities. However I do hope that people realize how MUCH of a nerf this would be. Single abilities in this fight do not kill -anyone-. Combinations do. Take out the combinations and you take out the deaths.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_423457"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->This is a different situation though Seth, but it is a decent analogy.<br>
<br>
If bloodboil also soul charged the raid, then yeah, it would be like archimonde - where you have unavoidable deaths followed by a punishing mechanic that causes more deaths and basically a wipe.  Bloodboil deaths can be unavoidable (a mage with nonstop crushing blows will die, not common but its happened to us a few times) - but because there isn't that mechanism in place, he is a very repeatable kill.<br>
<br>
And to the previous poster: difficulty really isn't the issue as much as reproducibility.  Difficult encounters are what we need for sure, but with extremely solid execution that should result in a kill.  <br>
<br>
Honestly, Hyjal as a zone could be much better with many tweaks.<br>
You could make archimonde more difficult while removing the unfair deaths with cooldowns, yet increasing the penalty for doomfire.  <br>
You could make all of the trash slightly harder, and make the first four bosses not a joke with checkpoints.  I think that would better the overall design.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Not entirely true, but I get your point. RoS is about the same difficulty as Archimonde but they are very different types of fights, the "randomness" is what makes Archimonde tricky, whereas RoS has zero randomness and is all about execution. Illidan is harder than both and also has zero randomness. Although I like all three fights, I really like the Archimonde fight even though others don't seem to.<br>
<br>
All randomness seems to do is make you wipe more on content that is supposed to be on farm, I think that's where the annoyance people are showing is coming from personally.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_423597"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Random? Sure. Harder than in 2.1.2? Not really.<br>
<br>
We always used more like 270° around archimonde, never the 180 and never the 360. We just kept the tactic we always had, the wipes we had last week were to the same reasons we had before: Not keybound Tears/lagging to death while falling/wrong use of fear break/decursers without enough oversight of the fight/wrong positioning.<br>
<br>
I would name the last as the most important one, its either 5 standing so inconveniently they all get the air burst (not really bad luck if they also get the grip if 20% of the raid always gets thrown away), sometimes even 5 without a decurser or healer. Or they ignore the leash they have to the decursers and healers finding a "good" dps spot where no doomfire can touch them, then dieing to burst/grip in some combination.<br>
<br>
My observation is that randomness does exist in this encounter, lower melee dps and some more raid dmg are the consequences of that, nothing pushing the encounter to a 100% wipe. We bring 8 healers which is enough for any kind of raid dmg spikes this encounter holds (theres also the occasional healthstone call on TS), 5 decursers is enough aswell if positioned correctly. If we can we bring 3 shamans for tremor totems.<br>
We are not threat capped (somehow our tank doesnt need to keep his gcd free for fear break and still manages it 100%) and hardly take longer than 6mins.<br>
<br>
Id suggest for decursers to use Grid, hell for anyone really. He turns and targets the ppl he throws Grip on or Air Burst on, i already spam that aggro marked box with remove curse and look at his cast bar, if its Air Burst i throw a hot on the target. <br>
Those who can use them mid fight are brining purification potions, they dont work 100% but they do work often enough to let them bring a stack for the air burst/grip situation without a healer.<br>
Also not all soul shard effects will kill you, some tend to give up when one raidmember dies, poke them till they stand up and fight on, you never know.<br>
<br>
There are so many failsafes for this encounter, whining about randomness just seems like a lack of ingenuity of implementing those.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Archimonde does not come back to you unless you do some aggro ability - sometimes changing stances is enough - but sometimes I have to battle shout, or even once had to physically hit him - and keeping rend up seems silly.  Every fear and cc in the game works like this - they did not recode the game just for archimonde.  What you're seeing is that he has a grace period after the fear before changing and requiring a kick back through aggro - most mobs have this as well!  Nightbane did for instance.  <br>
<br>
We've had 3-4 melee die when the enhancement shamans tremor totem pulses during the 0.5 to 1.0 second I'm feared on global, and that is generally a wipe.  I mean the totem will pulse 15% or so of the time you're feared on global, so why risk it?<br>
<br>
Dots, simply because you haven't experienced it doesn't mean its not true... he behaves the same as any other fearing mob in the game - and melee can be instagibbed even if you get the stance switch on time - how do I know this?  Because its happened to us more than once when I'm on the GCD.</div>

However, if he's out of melee range of me I have to either hit him, or shout for him to remember me.  Nightbane seemed to behave precisely the same way - proximity and timing likely govern the snap-back.  Mostly tanks focus governs everything there.  <br>
<br>
Looks like it is nearly 3 seconds before you're back in defensive stance, generally taking 1 hit.  Its reasonable - if you have a good plan for your healers its not a big deal.  The worst parts for a tank are definitely if you parry your first hit after a fear; and I wonder what happens if you parry an attack DURING the fear.  <br>
<br>
I'm still a fan of being off the global - as only Edgewalker can really press me on aggro (his dps stats/haste/AP are probably the best anyone has).  But sometimes I press for globals like IDS, Commanding, ITC, Deva for sunder - and get caught (a lot).  The key is if you can get into berserker stance before the fear things will be OK almost always; but if you miss it due to being distracted you're hosed.  However, we've still lost someone when I made the switch to berserker on time.  I think there might be a chance you get feared out of melee in even 1 second and he reacquires a broken-fear melee target.  I also (very rarely) have went to berserker stance and had it say 2 seconds left from the prior rage which was not done late - in those situations I yell for a paladin to bubble/dispel, but its fairly harrowing.<br>

I'm actually curious what casting bar mods other tanks have found and liked.  I use NECB and it is OK.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">First of all i agree that there is some luck in Archimonde fight but is this part of the fight more important than the luck part in fights with Bloodboil, Mother Shahraz even Teron Gorefiend? At Bloodboil fight you can have 3 mages in a row as targets in p2 and fast stacking debuff on them (hell its not needed to be mages even just fast stacking debuff) and you will wipe period. On Moter Shahraz you can be teleported right into melee or right on MT even and you will wipe. On Teron you can have only healers as spirits and you will lack healing and you will wipe. </div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>The thing is, you won't wipe 100%<br>
<br>
On Gorefiend, if you are worried about healers, save your soulstones/combat rezzes and even if your first 3 are healers, you can probably get them all up, on Shahraz, I've seen it with people ported right on melee or right on MT (or like 2 steps away or whatever) that doesn't make it a wipe, you move, people heal, keep going.  On Bloodboil, you can have targets die and not wipe.  We had the same warlock die twice on bloodboil this week, both times it went back to me as a tank, last standed one and they healed me through it, shield walled the second and he died.  If it was a huge problem and he was coming back a third time, and I had a big stack, we could have bopped me and let the other tank take it.<br>
<br>
That said, I can't say that you'd wipe 100% on some of the Archimonde deaths either, I haven't been in for all of our kills, but usually when someone dies, shortly after someone else dies, then we all do.  On pretty much any other fight in the game, if someone else dies, we call them a retard and keep going (or call their healers a retard and keep going)<br>
<br>
Combine the very low forgiveness for deaths with the possibility for random deaths that are unpreventable and you've got a problem.  Personally, if there's an issue with this fight I think it comes down to a very small fix.  People are talking about a 5 second cooldown, I think that's overdoing it (from my understanding of the fight as a tank)  give a 1 second cooldown and make people who are currently in the air untargetable with grips and you're done.  This prevents a grip air burst instant combo, so instead of having the time it takes for someone to go out of range moving instantly to decurse them, you've got an extra second, that should be handleable if you're doing it right (I'd think)  And you don't get people flung into the air, and just before they go out of range get gripped so that you have to hope they survive until they come back into range.  That leaves you with a fight that would still be very difficult, still very unforgiving of deaths, still minimal to no room for error (you have a decurse window now instead of someone who Archimonde put out of range getting cursed and dieing) but you have the window.  Anything else could be worked around (from my understanding) if you do it right.  Even a bad doomfire, get the guy some heals, have someone assigned to it and communicate, if it's just terrible for melee, move him.  I know we all hate that, but it's not the same as the "lol dead" combos, which should be the big problem.<br>
<br>
edit: Dots, you're right pretty much consistantly with every mob that does fear.  Just thinking back to Nefarian I've been slow on the swap on that when I was horde, walked a step in fear before breaking it, and he's still on me.  All fearing mobs detarget completely for probably about a second after casting, and if you've broken it by then you're still going to have aggro, and I'm pretty sure without doing anything.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Well, the combat log always lags a little compared to what you see in game. The first log is also one of the slowest fear breaks I could find. I just wanted to show 2 logs where you might expect him to attack someone else, but he actually didn't.<br>
Melee range might have to do with it, but it's hard to tell. You never really know how the server 'sees' the situation.<br>

</div>Thats not a overly bad suggestion at all, would allow for a raid to "brace" for the incoming onslaught.  <br>
<br>
I am semi excited to go back to archimonde this week, probably tonight.  Hopefully we'll get him this week, only had one night of attempts last week.  Overall a fun fight.  It is possible to recover from a soulcharge, we've done it a few times depending on when the fear is or how silly our raid members act around fire.<br>
<br>
I think we'll do much better this week with a fresh start and with a little more preperation.  The failure rate on purifications seemed low to me as well, I used about 12 and only had 1 fail, really small sample size though.  I didn't really trust my decursers.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">This fight can be fixed and i think it will but to be honest i think its not the only thing that needs to be fixed in Hijal. For me first thing that needs to be fixed is Azgalor fight and Thrall dieing from rain of fire for example. Its easy to pull boss in a way to not aggro Thrall and you can kill it easy but in this case why is Thrall there? To help you with trash? Or to fight with his big enemies? All in all i dont like whole Hijal instance because its too boring and have too easy bosses that will die from first few pulls for every guild that reach them. Trash is part of the boss fight but at the moment its the bigger part and this is not wath most of us want (or at least i think so).<br></div>

	</tr>

</div><br>
Are you serious?  Are you really going to sit there and say Archimonde is ok, but that Thrall needs fixing?  Azgalor is a joke.  Last night we cleared first 4 bosses in Hyjal (skipping Archimonde on purpose for now).  <br>
<br>
Our Azgalor fight was flawless, and our previous Azgalor kills were also very close to being flawless in the sense that at no time was Thrall anywhere near death.  The crazy thing is, we engage thrall in the fight at 99%.  Yes, thats right.  He's in the full duration of the fight.  Want to hear something else crazy?  We had 4 melee in on azgalor.  Oh, I forgot to mention, The Tauren warriors also engaged at 95%.<br>
<br>
Now doing some basic math...  Thrall + 4 melee + Tauren warriors = shitload of melee on Azgalor.<br>
<br>
Last night, We finished the fight with Thrall at 80% health.  Our secret is that apparently our DPS is so out of control, that Azgalor just insta gibs. <br>
<br>
WWS: in case you want to see specifics: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080530141242/http://www.lossendil.com/wws/?report=c2z4eru2a31re&amp;s=9683-9938" target="_blank">Wow Web Stats</a><br>
<br>
<br>
Anyway, I'm sorry to derail this thread, but comparing Azgalor/Thrall to Archimonde is rediculous.  Thrall is not the glass cannon that people make him out to be.  However, to continue beating a dead horse, Archimonde has a plethora of abilities that can conspire against your raid to cause wipes that make baby jesus want to cry.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_423917"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->The way we do az'galor I feel is completely, 100% repeatable, regardless of who gets doomed. <br>
<br>
We keep the MT and his healer 100 yards away near thrall (they cannot be doomed this far out), with Az'galor at the tauren camp.  The doomed player's mob is picked up by a feral druid who drags the mob to the tank.  The doomed player is battle rezzed or soulstoned, leaving basically no one dead until the 5th or so doom.  Even the feral has a backup.  <br>
<br>
I would guess the only way to wipe here would be a windfury+parry death streak, but that goes for any boss.   <br>
<br>
To me that truly seems like ingenuity overcoming the obstacles - not this lotto nonsense on archimonde.  We've tried literally half a dozen strats on archimonde, and they're all bollocks - they result in roughly the same results.  Personal execution is huge, but luck is as well.  Even if you're not that great at archimonde, you can win if things go well - even if you're great at archimonde, you can wipe if things do not go well.<br>
Two pulls back to back on this fight are consistent in being inconsistent (although not nearly as much as pre-patch).  Its basically annoying.<br>
<br>
Fights are supposed to be fun, not something you dread.  Many of you know what I'm talking about - there are those fights that you dread even logging in for, because you know it is going to be a royal pain to get done.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

This also doesn't mean that you shouldn't use deathwish, what I found works best is I break the first fear with deathwish (after the MT breaks his) and then dps until the fear cooldown is up. Usually there are a few seconds left on deathwish, at that point and i back up 10yds or so, just incase the fear comes immediately and the MT has short GCD issues. Once deathwish drops I return to melee range and zerker out of the fear <i>after</i> the MT.

				<div style="font-style:italic">I also saw your post about "why would I not use deathwish on a fight w/ an enrage timer" that you edited. While the "get some brain" comment may be seen as a bit harsh, I believe you must remember that this is a <i>survivability</i> fight before a <i>omgdps</i> fight.<br>
<br>
This also doesn't mean that you shouldn't use deathwish, what I found works best is I break the first fear with deathwish (after the MT breaks his) and then dps until the fear cooldown is up. Usually there are a few seconds left on deathwish, at that point and i back up 10yds or so, just incase the fear comes immediately and the MT has short GCD issues. Once deathwish drops I return to melee range and zerker out of the fear <i>after</i> the MT. You still get ~25/30 seconds from your deathwish and there is less chance for getting melee'd if you've got some distance.<br>

However, it should again not be a problem since last night we did TK and got a new dwarf priest attuned as well, so when we go back this week we should be set with FW for the tank, and able to use our druid for stability.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">The way we do az'galor I feel is completely, 100% repeatable, regardless of who gets doomed. <br>
<br>
We keep the MT and his healer 100 yards away near thrall (they cannot be doomed this far out), with Az'galor at the tauren camp.  The doomed player's mob is picked up by a feral druid who drags the mob to the tank.  The doomed player is battle rezzed or soulstoned, leaving basically no one dead until the 5th or so doom.  Even the feral has a backup.  <br>
<br>
I would guess the only way to wipe here would be a windfury+parry death streak, but that goes for any boss.   <br>
<br>
To me that truly seems like ingenuity overcoming the obstacles - not this lotto nonsense on archimonde.  We've tried literally half a dozen strats on archimonde, and they're all bollocks - they result in roughly the same results.  Personal execution is huge, but luck is as well.  Even if you're not that great at archimonde, you can win if things go well - even if you're great at archimonde, you can wipe if things do not go well.<br>
Two pulls back to back on this fight are consistent in being inconsistent (although not nearly as much as pre-patch).  Its basically annoying.<br>
<br>
Fights are supposed to be fun, not something you dread.  Many of you know what I'm talking about - there are those fights that you dread even logging in for, because you know it is going to be a royal pain to get done.</div>

I dont say azgalor is not repeatable all i say its just stupid that you need to pull him away form Thrall because Thrall is just too stupid and can die and you cant do anything about it. If you think this fight is ok and Archimonde fight is not ok than i just can't understand your logic? <br>
<br>
For me the best thing Blizzard can do is to rework whole instance and make trash minor part of it and bosses the major obstacle or something similar. And for Archimonde fight its obvious that something needs to be change because there are too much people that think its broken (yes i dont think so but i like fight with personal involvment that are close to impossible).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

The real tricky part of Azgalor isn't Thrall - which is easily fixed just by the pull and afterward the positioning. It's more or less how well your raid handles randomness. Have your healers load up the tank with HoTs like old-school Maexxna or even Gruul.<br>
The easiest way to keep your tank alive during Silence is to have him just turn auto-attack off and have supplementary warriors make use of Intervene. Azgalor not being able to parry means his attack speed won't increase and he can't frontload any considerable amount of damage while your healers are silenced. Threat shouldn't be an issue since your ranged DPS aren't generating threat due to silence and your Melee (assuming you have Melee on Azgalor) are dodging RoF half the time.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_425547"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Back to Archimonde and the air burst/grip problem.<br>
<br>
I've spent a ton of time thinking about this mechanic, and the best solution I've come up with is this.  Since eredar/draenei are already known to have the ability to project an aura around them, have Archimonde have an aura with a 40 yard radius, to ensure that if someone is attacking him/healing people are likely within range of the aura.  Have grip + aura = normal DoT damage of the grip until cured.  If people are burst with the grip on them, they will be thrown out of range of the aura, and take no damage from it until the grip is either cured, wears off, or they are back in range of the fight.<br>
<br>
It removes the random factor of grip hitting a player after burst or while they are getting burst causing a player's death (and likely wiping the raid) without gimping the base design of the fight.  It also preserves the idea of player mobility being key to being able to win this fight, and provides a mechanism for raids with few decursers to still have some sort of viable plan to win.<br>
<br>
Just seems like an easy thing to implement that would have the least impact in how the fight is supposed to work.<br>
<br>
At any rate, just a thought.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I also saw your post about "why would I not use deathwish on a fight w/ an enrage timer" that you edited. While the "get some brain" comment may be seen as a bit harsh, I believe you must remember that this is a <i>survivability</i> fight before a <i>omgdps</i> fight.<br>
<br>
This also doesn't mean that you shouldn't use deathwish, what I found works best is I break the first fear with deathwish (after the MT breaks his) and then dps until the fear cooldown is up. Usually there are a few seconds left on deathwish, at that point and i back up 10yds or so, just incase the fear comes immediately and the MT has short GCD issues. Once deathwish drops I return to melee range and zerker out of the fear <i>after</i> the MT. You still get ~25/30 seconds from your deathwish and there is less chance for getting melee'd if you've got some distance.<br>

</div>That's exactly what I do to the tee, Death Wish and premature fear breaks are a DPS warriors only liability on the fight. <br>

</div>We also stack shaman for this one.  I think that with practice (and shaman) this fight becomes much more reasonable.  We had 4 solid attempts before killing him this week.<br>

If there is a group without a shaman, stack it with the following:<br>
 - People with the 2 minute PVP trinket<br>
 - Undead for WOTF (if you're horde) <br>
 - Priests/Paladins for fear dispels<br>
<br>
This week, we had a group with a shadowpriest and paladin alternating trinket use to immediately dispel fear from their group.  On average, it's almost as reliable as a tremor totem.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_426545"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I think 3 shaman is really the minimum you want to go with on this fight.  4 is better of course and 5 is ideal, and usually what we run with this for this fight.<br>
<br>
If you don't have the shaman I guess I can understand the complaints.. we've stacked it so I can't really relate.  We had 6 wipes last night and frankly all but one of them were easily explained by people in the raid screwing up in some way or another, not due to some RNG thing.  <br>
<br>
This fight is harsh on people dying.  It should be, it's the end boss of a T6 zone.   People really, really, really have to focus on survival first.  There were quite a few times last night where I was just running directly away from Archimonde with a Doomfire in tow.  I might have not even dps'ed him for a good 25-30 seconds.  So what?  I lived, and that's the primary objective.  I was also already mentally prepared for what I needed to do if I got gripped+bursted too.   Always, always ask yourself "If I got gripped + bursted right now, what would I do?"   Or "If I got gripped right now, am I near a decurser?" -- this is a good question to ask right after a fear.   The biggest aid to this I can say is mark your decursers with raid symbols.  I always knew where they were at.  When I'm flying through the air, I'm looking down at where those symbols are, because I'm assuming I'm going to get gripped on the way down.<br>
<br>
This one fight moreso than any else is a complete paradigm shift in how you have to think.  DPS'ing is just something I do inbetween surviving.<br>
<br>
Finally, yes it's a pretty unforgiving fight for deaths, but it's certainly survivable.  If you can just prevent anyone else dying after the Soul Charge, you can get things stabilized again.<br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong, I'm not opposed to some changes on the mechanics of Grip + Air Burst, but I still rather enjoy this fight the way it is.  I love running scared for my life from a Doomfire.  I love the feeling that I'm just an inch from disaster, yet surviving all the same.  This fight challenges all 25 players, both individually and as a group, to survive.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_426612"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->We killed it finally (our 4th night on him) last night, 2 shaman - we are gluttons for hardmode I suppose however (0 sp :x).  I'd say easily ~60 wipes over all these days, took us 14 tries last night, but our attempts got better and better.  As it was said many times, no matter what your raid composition, the more you attempt and learn, the easier it becomes.  Each night we were another 5-10% ahead on average than the previous night.  What kind of sucks, our dps warrior got bursted, gripped and while he was ~150 yards up in the air, Archimonde turned and melee swung him for 11k.  This caused a second death as well (druid).  I think weekly this encounter will become easier than the last, with the sheer amount of practice everyone has - it's another huge communication fight for us (which is hard, we're bad at that).  We pretty much had to treat it like an arena game, everyone had to announce what was happening to them throughout the fight.  Definitely would not have won without that level of communication.<br>
<br>
I feel Hyjal is quite devastating at first, everyone posts about how poor the zone is.  However, after time I grow to like it a lot more than BT.  We cleared up to Archimonde in ~3 hours this week, and our first Archimonde kill came on our 4th hour on him.  Hyjal trash used to be brutal, I hated it.  But as you get practice (ie: after your first kill), it becomes second nature, and even a single wipe isn't that big of a deal since you most likely won't wipe to the boss more than once (if that).  Even the trash doesn't bother me in the least now, although I'm quite worried about repeat kills on Arch with 2 shaman.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I'm in the same boat. Maybe I'm a glutton for pain, but I can't wait to face Gruul's older brother with Gruul 1.0 mechanics. I really enjoyed the level of play for the original Gruul (obviously it didn't fit the raiding progression).<br>
<br>
Archimonde is in the same boat. The proposed tweaks to Grip (no overlap on burst or tears removing grip) wouldn't destroy the gratification of downing Archimonde. Everything else about this fight can be chalked up to human error or controllable (fear + doomfire strike), which I can deal with.<br>
<br>
Parry mechanics on bosses should probably be looked into, too, but I believe it's interesting in other play. Pets / NPCs should be less retarded where they attack from.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

After seeing him again this reset I still don't think this fight is anymore random than most fights, i'd even say Mother is worse with the FA port locations, every death we've seen on Archimonde we've been able to point out what caused it, and it was because someone had messed up. The fight is all about communication between the decursers and the people who have Grip, especially when it's air burst + grip, although most classes have an easy way out of that combo. I think making it so grip can't be cast on someone in the air would actually make the fight way too easy tbh.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_426738"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Mother also has a lot of stupidly random things, just really saying anything is "less random" than Mother doesn't make it good.  Since I don't dps I can't comment too well on the Archimonde issues, but Mother has several stupid "you did everything perfect but now you're dead" moments.  2 healers in a couch early on, porting offtanks and gibbing the MT with lash, 3 people ported on the MT not having good resists on it at the same time as 2 melee's and a lash hit.<br>
<br>
Archimonde may or may not be as bad as some people are saying, but saying Mother is more random in a bad way than other fights is far from making other fights okay.  Cause really, even with micromanaging heals if Mother decides your tank is going to die, he's going to die.  There's more or less shit all you can do she she melee's, parries the tank, saber lashes and melee's again, doing 23000 damage or more in less than a second, and worse when combined with a beam or FA.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_426946"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->It's an interesting fight now - we stacked it with 5 shamans and 5 decursers, one of them being me in healing gear while still feral talented - having an extra group healer who can decurse is very useful. If you don't have the shamans/decursers to stack, it's very much a painful and "luck based" fight. Tremors for every group and lots of decursers definitely helps to cut down on randomness.<br>
<br>
We did it pre-doomfire-change with 3 groups and dealt with it - obviously the 2 groups partially in front of him got a world of pain, and I think that helped us deal with it post-patch. We actually had 3 people die on our kill, at around 35/30/25 and still handled it alright. The tremors and decurse/healer stacking certainly helped.

</div>This was one of our big problems learning the fight, but through re-thinking healing assignments after our first night of work we were able to come back with a better set-up for the second night...and suddenly the MT healing problems were gone.  Yes, she's capable of some truly punishing damage on the tank but I don't recall a single instance on that second night where the tank dropped dead without a number of crucial healers down.  Especially considering she can't crush, healing on the MT can be ironclad if you play it right.  Paches actually swapped out some tanking pieces for SR that night to further mitigate the luck factor, and again...even with horrible FA ports directly on top of him, he wasn't dying.<br>

</div>I've been feared through the world twice, both times before our first kill (pre-doomfire changes). I don't know if it still happens but both times were as I was in a group on the south side of Archimonde (around where he's at initially as you pull), feared south from there and then my screen turned blue and I fell for what seemed like a minute or more.<br>
<br>
The fight is still very random but after a couple kills it only takes an attempt or two to "warm up" to the randomness and get settled with what's going on. This week took only 4 or 5 attempts and only one wipe cascaded from something random we couldn't help (hunter eats grip+air burst, died as a druid ran to decurse but he was thrown too far away).<br>
<br>
I had no shaman this week (as Nat described in his post) and just alternated between WOTF and PVP trinket as needed - not only to avoid being feared into doomfires, but moreso to dispel my groupmates so they could save their trinkets and keep up heals/decurses as needed.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_427041"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->So I went through logs, watched videos, checked out screenshots, and it just seems a fluke that our warrior got killed at the peak of his air burst.  He was riding the top agro by a very fine line, I'm talking a few hundred apparently, below the MT.  He got bursted and his deep wounds ticked for 203, and at the same time our MT missed or had dodge/parry on Arch, and the 203 damage pulled hate while he was in the air.  Arch turned around and hit him while he's easily 100 yards up in the air, and then goes back to the MT.  Pretty awful luck.<br>

		<div id="post_message_427865"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I haven't read all the post from every person in this thread.. We have killed Archimonde 3 times now, 2 pre patch and once after the patch. But the kill after patch we had on him was with 3 Shamans and with a bit of luck. Yesterday and the day before that we wiped on him for ages it felt like... This time we only had 2 Shamans. Anyway, my 'question' about this fight is is it possible to Resist the Doomfire? Because from the problems we had yesterday it was mostly the Doomfire who made us wiped.. This is something I came up on after the raid so dident get the chance to try it out with Fire Res gear. I'm 99,9% sure about you are able to resist the Doomfire Debuff, because I remember I resisted from time to time something whenever I got close to a doomfire.. But I also know that if you getting the Debuff you wont be able to resist the DoT you having on you. <br>
<br>
Someone tested with High Fire Rest and walking in the Doomfires? Because with this problem gone it would only be two problems left. Airburst + Curse. The fear aint a problem because it will be also solved with Fire Res and our Tank havent failed the FearBreaking except the first trys on Archimonde(a couple of weeks ago that is).<br>
<br>
Ofc Melee shouldn't really need this Fire Res, why is because they have so many Fear Breaks already.. Warriors, Berserker rage, deathwise and trinket(maybe even wotf). Rogues, trinket, wotf and skillcloak. Druids on the other hand aint really a big problem either because they can always go up and heal themself if needed. <br>
<br>
But would be nice to see if someone tested it or not.. The thing with having High Fire Resist. <br>

		<div id="post_message_427880"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->The problem with stacking fire resist is the 10 minute enrage more than anything. <br>
<br>
The easiest way to deal with the fight is:<br>
<br>
5 shamans<br>
5 decursers<br>
5+ raid healers<br>
3+ MT healers<br>
<br>
Stack the raid like that, and there should be no way you won't win, unless your DPS die horribly and then you wipe to enrage (which shouldn't happen with that many healers/decursers in the first place). We stacked the raid with 5 shamans, 5 decursers and 8 healers and the first time no-one died to "lol i didn't click tears, silly me" we killed it. We still had 3 people die on the kill, which hurt a lot (soul charges ftl) but we didn't wipe. It's a fight where you can recover from soul charge - it just requires a lot of paying attention (and if you weren't paying attention in the first place, what the hell were you doing in the raid anyway?).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Dunno about FR, sounds not very useful to me. Very high sta gear however helps a lot. And there is plenty of good sta gear for all classes that won't lessen your dps that much. Just make sure cloth users are well above 10k.<br>
Also as it was pointed out in this post, you can douse the doomfire by running into the lake. It will silence you for 30s but if multiple guys were hit by that, it is certainly a good idea to do that.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">The problem with stacking fire resist is the 10 minute enrage more than anything. <br>
<br>
The easiest way to deal with the fight is:<br>
<br>
5 shamans<br>
5 decursers<br>
5+ raid healers<br>
3+ MT healers<br>
<br>
Stack the raid like that, and there should be no way you won't win, unless your DPS die horribly and then you wipe to enrage (which shouldn't happen with that many healers/decursers in the first place). We stacked the raid with 5 shamans, 5 decursers and 8 healers and the first time no-one died to "lol i didn't click tears, silly me" we killed it. We still had 3 people die on the kill, which hurt a lot (soul charges ftl) but we didn't wipe. It's a fight where you can recover from soul charge - it just requires a lot of paying attention (and if you weren't paying attention in the first place, what the hell were you doing in the raid anyway?).</div>

</div>This is basically an ideal setup obviously.  Also for resisting doomfire - you will always resist doomfire strike, and I believe you resist doomfire more readily as you are further from the graphic.  In fact you "Catch on fire" with the graphic well before taking damage.  But check your logs, the initial strike is always resisted.  <br>
<br>
I love comments like "there should be no way you won't win."  Could you give me the recipe for every boss so we can never wipe again?  If those 3 deaths had been priests I'm relatively sure you wouldn't have won that pull.  <br>
<br>
One thing people can do is keep pushing through as best as possible through soul charges, because sometimes even a chain of 2-3 deaths is manageable, and often times people just shut down there.  However, a silence is going to kill you more often than not.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_428126"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->We just spent our first full session in with Archimonde.  Eight hours of wipes in very quick to....reasonably quick succession and I'm knackered.  Having read this thread and the others like it beforehand, I was a bit daunted by the whole thing.  After experiencing the amazing power of Archie's wonderful array of 'I win' buttons first hand, I'm still a little daunted but equally optimistic.<br>
<br>
I liked the way that a lot of the 'There's no sodding way I could get out of that' situations that occured over the first few hours slowly became 'Well yeah, if I did x I could actually get out of it now' and people started to 'get' the fight.  <br>
<br>
What I'm optimistic about is that I think we can quickly get to a point where no one is doing anything specifically wrong.  Going ten minutes without a screw up certainly isn't beyond the realms of possibility.  Yet what worries me is firstly the speed and regularity at which a decent attempt (our best was around 50% I think) can go totally tits up in such a spectacular fashion with no one particular person at fault and secondly, and even more so, the class stacking that the fight pretty much demands.  One of our shamans or decursers can't make the next raid; I know it should certainly be a tricky fight, but should that really be a showstopper?<br>
<br>
At the moment I can only agree with previous posters that some of Archimondes abilities need to put others on cooldowns in order to reduce the amount of 'you lose' instacombos.  Or certain conditions mean immunity to others, Doomfired can't be gripped or something.  <br>
<br>
After one day, I think it's a really fun encounter.  The usual multi-tasking but with the Airburst minigame thrown in for good measure.  But I can just imagine how frustrating some of the randomness could be after a few days.<br>
<br>
Just have to see how we get on tomorrow...<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Yep. It's just as I thought when I started this thread. We attempted him our first day with 0 shamans. Our second day with one. The results were disastrous. Without multiple shaman in the raid, the fight IS extended. And you're just creating more and more opportunities for those small things to go wrong. <br>
<br>
It's an unfortunate fact, but like many encounters in the current end game, having more shamans in the raid increases your chances of victory dramatically.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_428265"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I take your point, however it wasnt a problem at all for any content prior. But, in any case, that's not the point I was trying to make. <br>
<br>
We wont go to Archimonde with any less than two in the future. We've accepted that, recruited, and will happily take more once we have them attuned.  <br>
<br>
They are a large part of this encounter, particularly if resto, as they can fill two very important roles.  Other fights dont see a class remove a boss ability which can otherwise hinder 90% + of your raid (tremor can help on healing, improve DPS and reduce the chances of people dieing to fires, grip etc). Other fights have roles that CAN be filled by other classes much more competently. I dare say the difference between 2 and 5 shamans on Archimonde is much bigger than 2 mages versus 5 mages on Tidewalker, or 2 warriors v 5 warriors on Hydross. You cant take a paladin instead of your 3rd shaman, and have her/him perform in the same way that a druid can step in and perform on Hydross.<br>
<br>
I just dislike being pigeon-holed into raiding certain content when we have 35-40 capable raiders online, but not those 2, 3 or 4 shaman. It would be like making Hydross and his adds have an unhealable, but spell reflectable ability, removing druid tanks as an option. <br>
<br>
Other fights allow us to make use of other classes in essential roles.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
<br>
As a side note, I saw an interesting bug today, I got air bursted while running away from flames, on my combat log (sorry no screenshots... but probably happened to others and easy to reproduce) it shown me as air busted and as I got in the air, right on takeoff, the flames caught up to me and gave me doomfire. <br>
<br>
The most interesting part is over the next 6 seconds while I was completely in the air I was taking FULL ticks of doomfire, it was somehow re-applying itself even though I was completely in the air. Obviously I died . I concluded my initial doomfire was server lag, that as I took off the fire caught up to me and the server din't have time to realize I'm a bit above the fire but the dot re-applying itself? very weird.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

The key? 5 shamans, 9 healers, 5 decursers. Fear was basically non-existant and raid bars were much more stable. Although we did play exceptionally well and adjusted to all the deaths.

</div>tbh, it is like most posts says here.. it is mostly about your setup. You will understand the whole fight within 2-3 trys maybe.. People need to learn click the feather on the way down. Not to early and not to late. You have to spread out your decursers. Try to have shamans in the none UD groups if you not lacking in shamans here. IMO if you dont have a really good geared tank, don t think you have it if you havent been really lucky with the loot from the bosses. Anyway, you need like 3 healers dedicated to spam the Tank with quick heals. Ofc other healers should always have him as Prio 1 in healing aswell. Because you will for sure see the nice combos with 8k+8k just like that on the tank(because of the parry shit). If you have a smart tank he should also maybe go with some dodge trinkets that he can use when the fear is happening. Because at the fear time most of the healers wont be able to heal even if they want to :&gt;<br>
<br>
Bloodboil is a less random fight, that is all about getting bloodboil groups to understand what they are suppose to do. And get the healing fixed for Phase2. But you probly will learn and understand Archimonde fight alot faster then bloodboil, even if Archimonde is a random fight.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_428320"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I think people are overstating the uncontrollable death issue.  It can and will happen once in a while - not every attempt (and often it'll spoil a kill attempt).  But the randomness of the fight is what makes it suck... Even if the deaths are in a perfect world: manageable, you're going to wipe sometimes.  And the nature of this fight means a lot of deaths that even controllable, will happen barring some luck to avoid those circumstances of that person, at that place, at that time.  Coupled with disconnects, the punishing mechanic, fears through the world, double priest soul charges, and just soul charge itself, it can turn what was otherwise a 1-2 shot into a 4 hour epic marathon.<br>
<br>
I just don't see anything redeeming about this fight.  Its outdoors - thats about it.  <br>
<br>
Fix the timers, make it so doomfires 65 yards from the boss do not cause doomfire damage (or don't spread beyond that range).  Maybe make him crush and adjust accordingly.  I love hearing about feral druids tanking and getting 3k hits, being healed by 1 player.  <br>
Fix the priest bug, fix being feared through the world, fix the parry mechanic - anyway, we've been over this shit before.  These types of issues tend to snowball in MMO's, and Archimonde isn't even the worst of it in TBC when it comes to random and uncontrollable stuff.  <br>
<br>
Anyway, it is certainly easier to come on these forums and post about epic 1 shots, but I can assure you for every 2-shot there are dozens 20-shots.  Anyway, I'm not sure what the point of anecdotal testimony is anymore; I'm just not looking forward to "farming" archimonde for the next 6 months for all the reasons already stated many, many, times above... <br>
<br>
From what I can tell though very few people have much to contribute here beyond "its okay, learn to play" or "Its too hard/random/qq, fix".  If you have some killer strategy that prevents you from being feared in mid air (another bug), or being air bursted, gripped, and landing in a doomfire behind you, then being feared away from a healer, that isn't already discussed, then please! share.<br>
<br>
Heres a fight that benefits hugely from 5 shaman stacking, (preempting the next post: whether you decide to or can use it or not) fear ward, random elements affecting difficulty, berserk timers, has punishing mechanics for single mistakes that often mean a wipe.  Is that not many of the worst aspects of encounter design?  If archimonde was a gnome inside a BWL-like room and was named "BossThree" I'm not sure he'd get the same reception - and no, because he's the final boss doesn't mean he should suck in a random way... afaik most people seem to like Illidan just fine, cthun, kt, nef, rag, vashj, kael... good fights basically.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_428370"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->We finally downed him last night, 18th attempt of the night, I think 54th overall.  2 nights of learning.  Pretty much went as described in this thread, 90-65-80-55-60-etc. could be any random number between 50-100.  Then suddenly, click, its over, archimonde down, scooping the loot.  Had only 3 shamans, even had a paladin die at 17%, but we somehow held it together.   54 Attempts for an end boss seems reasonable, I guess? I think sadly most of us are dreading next week when we have to try and repeat.  <br>

		<div id="post_message_428416"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->As a healer, having 8 or more total, and 3 or more shamans make the fight as controllable as it can possibly be. The chances of getting those sure-death combos like grip + air + potion fail won't happen every attempt. Although the fight entails some bit of luck to be on your side, if the raid composition is built around classes that are heavily relied upon, the easier it is to be consistent in downing him in less than 5 attempts each week.<br>
<br>
Our most recent kill was plagued with mishaps and whatnot, but we won nonetheless. I'm not ashamed to credit the kill to "stacking", as we were loaded on shammies and decursers. At the same time, people learned to live through situations where we had wiped countless times to on our first week of killing him. I took the liberty of singling out people and remind them to pop pots, break fears etc etc. Last thing I remember, it was looting time. <!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Random screwage notwithstanding, I think this fight is by far the best in Hyjal.  Maybe not for all classes, but it's a total blast as a druid.  I'm running around staying away from fire, decursing, keeping as many HoTs as possible up on the MT, running back and NSing emergency folks, zooming back into the fray after being flung, only using my PvP trinket when I absolutely have to, etc.  It's really dynamic, interesting, exciting fight.<br>
<br>
As others have said, if I had one tip for people, it would be to stay away from the fire.  Even if that puts you way away from your home base, stay away.  I think we three-pulled him last night, all reasonably good pulls (8 healers, 4 shaman IIRC), and I never had to use my trinket at all.  I probably got tremor totemed out of less than half my fears, but if you're conservative with your placement it's not a huge concern.  90% of the time that I've seen people eat a doomfire it was because they were way closer to it than they should have been or didn't respond quickly enough to it spawning or zigged when they should have zagged.<br>
<br>
I'm not sure if people are overstating the "you lose" combo odds, but in probably 50 total pulls now I've never personally been air burst/gripped or air bursted into a doomfire.  It really feels to me that "you lose" combos happen considerably less than 50% of the time, which isn't all that bad really.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_428884"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Personally, for a guild with 1 Archimonde kill and currently on Reliquary in BT, I just don't see it as worth it for us to continue attempting to kill Arch for the loot when we have BT progression to do. I agree that it's the best fight in Hyjal, it's by far my favorite boss encounter there, but there's no denying that the fight can be a major pain in the ass. My guild doesn't have the ability to stack shamans (killed with two, raiding currently with one available), and while the loot and fight is pretty amazing, I just don't see it as being worth it for the time investment it'd take us.<br>
<br>
It's really unfortunate because like I said, I think the fight is amazing, especially the ending; it's just a shame that such a great encounter has such flawed design that you need x amount of x to have a chance. I agree that even without shamans it's very doable just by great play and a little luck on purification pots, but I don't think you could realistically expect to get such a stellar level of play from all 25 people in the raid for the entirety of the fight every single week, it seems like it'd just be grossly inconsistent which is what makes it not worth doing, in my eyes.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_428898"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->We were fortunate enough to one shot him this week. I'm not sure if it was the constant reminders of how important Doomfire avoidance is, or if we just got a little lucky, or if it was a combination of the two, but we ended up killing him with 0 deaths on our first attempt of the night. Of course our raid was pretty ridiculous with 5 shaman, 10 healers and 7 decursers(We make our feral druids respec restoration for this fight.)<br>
<br>
The fight isn't too far away from being 'fun'. Fun is within its grasp. I think a little tinkering with Doomfire could make a big difference, especially for guilds that aren't fortunate enough to have 5 shaman every night.

Minor run speed is also a huge help for this fight. Hopefully we get him tonight ^^.

		<div id="post_message_429109"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->When guilds that reliably kill a mob use 5 people (shamans in this case) to basically negate one of the mob's ability, maybe it's time to review the ability ?<br>
I mean, the problem is not the doomfire in itself, it's obviously the ae fear. It's nice and all for some guilds to be able to stack 4/5 shamans in their raid and simply remove the ae fear from the fight, but you can't expect every guild to be able to provide those shamans (we have 2 shamans guilded, we killed archimonde twice pre buff, too busy with bt progress since then).<br>
Anyways, if you want to make archimonde a funnier fight, first thing to tweak is the fear. Decreasing its duration to 4 sec would be a good start. Don't let archimonde cast grip less than 3 sec before air burst, increase a bit the fear cast time (not everyone plays with less than 500 ms ..). Or, if they want to keep this aspect of randomness, modify soul charge because it's way too harsh if random deaths are intended.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I would say this version is far far easier than the previous. It is now impossible for melee to be hit by fire on spawn, so melee dps is higher and the fight is shorter. For ranged the fight is basically the same as before, move if there is a fire nearby, always keep in range of a decurser. <br>
<br>
We have always used a spread around him, so our ranged are used to having to actually move from fires. Clearly stacking shaman will make the fight easier, but whatever number of shaman you use, this version is easier in my opinion mainly due to doomfires spawning behind melee/tank rather than on them.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I agree with that, beginning our first attempts this week, i'm disappointed how this final boss is. I don't understand why they put the AoE Fear as the key mechanics of the fight. Testing the tank skill as stance dancer ? Like Magmadar (Archimonde is just a reskinned Magmadar with curse and burst), Onyxia, Nefarian, Nightbane, Sanguinar, and those i forget... whereas other way can be found, like archi(with more hp) casting a +x% dmg on MT, then reflection should be used with the risk of taking more dmg but if succesful it bring more dps. <br>
Testing the rest of the raid ? If they can click at the good moment on pvp trinket or wotf ? There is allready air burst for that (and we got suckers blowed up :/). Positionning ? Doomfire and air  burst are allready positionning issue.<br>
Testing if the guild can stack shaman/FW priest ? probably...<br>
<br>
I'm not complaining because of wiping on him having 2 shamans, looking at our attempts it's obvious there is a way to down him soon. I'm just disapointed by the lack of boss design, especially for a final boss. Soul charge is fine, dying by missing tears of the goddess, slacking on decurse, lack of healing, bad raid positionning, inattention of doomfire pop and move should be hardly penalized. But for example, on a 'perfect' try : a warlock, far away of a doomfire, run directly in while doomfire snaked to him, taking the doomfire at the 6th second of the fear (no sham &amp; not ud) and air burst at the same second. He receive HoTs&amp;mending at liftoff, take healing pot, stone and land far away (72fall dmg). Then archimonde grip him and whisp him 'owned' (healing pot take purification cooldown). 6sec silence, try again. I agree Soul charge can be subdue, but the 6sec silence one, without heal and decurse, you're just lucky if you don't get another dead. <br>
<br>
A way to improve is to remove ae fear, replacing it by another challenging ability that dont require sham stacking to avoid it. Or modify the range of fear to a shortest range, in that way MT should stance dance, FW and tremor are usefull, but on less people (melee) so the result is same but it dont require stacking.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_429410"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Alternativly they could just lower the cooldown and give it a small cast time which can be interupted, thus providing abit more to be 'controlled' and if you miss it once or twice? oh noes... but the other 5+ times you wont will be much appreciated.<br>
<br>
AoE Fear is the most retarded weapon in Blizzards generic boss armory of abilities, its fair(er) enough on fights where its a fear... your tank has to stance dance and you need hots on him or find another way to keep him healed and thats it... but the doomfire factor is just silly.<br>
They might aswell make doomfire spawn directly ontop of someone if they are adamant that players are ment to get the debuff from it, and remove the fear completly.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>As someone just reading the thread (I havent done the fight  yet) I love the how this fight sounds. The fear sounds like a very important part of the design philosophy of the fight. I don't really understand why people want it removed - simply because they 'dont like fear'?<br>
<br>
The whole point of blizz's archimonde vs you (imo) design, is meant to make you feel very small and force you to go to huge lengths simply to retain a small semblance of control over your character - simply to stay alive. I find that a very appealing design attitude.  They could have made archimonde just a big ultimate 'tank and spank' boss, but they went with something quite different and I think its refreshing. <br>
<br>
Hes fearing you round, hes throwing you up.. your character is getting beaten every which way. Hes in total control and your struggling to keep some control or suffer dire consequences. Your death could come very quick, at any second - with even a small mistake or lapse of concentration. Removing the fear and doing something like simply having 'fire spawn on someone' really takes away a big chunk of that philosophy towards how they designed the fight. <br>
<br>
I can't comment on whether the fights too random/unfair/unforgiving and how best to change that etc - but as an interested observer the idea behind his design to me is something very impressive.  Most bosses im familiar with, it feels like the raid controls the boss  - I cant wait to try this fight and have it reversed. <br>
<br>
I do have one question though, since unfortunately I wont get to see Illidan/Archimonde for sometime.... Ive read people refer to Illidan as 'harder' than this fight. What aspect of his fight makes it harder? I mainly ask, because Ive seen many Illidan videos where the majority of the fight it looks like they really have <i>him </i>under control for much of the fight. On all the archimonde information available, it seems like a bigger struggle, that can fall apart at any moment?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>As that quote mentions, if Blizzard is intending classes to be roughly equally represented in raids, ~3 each, then its fairly understandable that some encounters simply will be difficult if your guild wants to go against this mentality - and that doesnt necessarily mean the fight is badly designed. Your guild might have no choice but to adapt to Blizzards design idea for raid class setup. <b>But....</b><br>
<br>
Somebody could say , 'to what extent can a 4th or 5th of that class trivialise the fight' - and thats a very fair comment to make. So heres my question to someone whos killed archimonde. How would you rate the difficulty of the fight if you have (1) , (3) and (5) shamans, respecively. If blizzard is intending we have 3 per class and the fights difficulty is balanced around 3 of each class, im curious to see how the fight difficulty would deviate if you brought 1/2 or 4/5. Is the difference really as dramatic as people say, if you had 2 or 4? Or is skill still the determining factor?<br>
<br>
I realise people have alluded in various parts of the thread as to 'how much easier' or 'how much harder' it can be, but id like something a little more tangible. Ultimately, id love to know what strategies Blizzard can use to design a fight to be balanced for optimal difficulty at 3 per class, but not get too hard/easy if you deviate from that.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_429507"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->The difficulty is more than just "number of shamans * X = difficulty", as there are many other ways of breaking fear. If you have 5 DPS warriors in the raid, they can all break their own fears if needed and so won't "need" a shaman for that aspect. If you have a lot of undeads who all have the better PvP trinket then they can survive pretty well without a tremor too. If you have 5 dwarf priests, that would also impact the difficulty. <br>
<br>
<br>
As said a few posts up, the difficulty of the fight is trying to retain control over your character. More fear breaks = more control = easier fight. If you only have 2 shamans, but 15 undead characters with PvP trinkets (of which say 3 are frost mages for ice block and 3 are rogues with CloS for fire, although I'm not certain that works), then you could easily form groups where everyone has multiple fear breaks. What Mearis said is true - fear is quite a stupid mechanic to balance a boss around because specific classes/races change the balance significantly.<br>
<br>
I would certainly say that having a horde raid (wotf) with many PvP trinkets and 5 shamans for tremor virtually trivialises the fight. Even with 4 deaths (2xdruid, warrior, shaman) it was still pretty easy to control when we did it like that.<br>
<br>
I'm also not sure I can think of a fight which _doesn't_ get significantly easier/harder with class/spec imbalance. The other issue is that you could have 2 perfectly balanced 3-per-class raids and end up with 2 completely different setups because of different specs. A raid with 3 shadow priests, 3 feral/balance druids, 3 enhancement/elemental shamans and 3 retribution/prot paladins is totally screwed for healers. <br>
<br>
I think the original "3 per class" thing came about because 25/9 = ~2.8<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_429697"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I hate to ask for advice, but this fight really gets to me...<br>
<br>
We did our first round of attempts last night. We brought something like 5 shamans, 4 decursers, and about 9 healers, so we had a "stacked" raid for the most part. We usually raid 4 hours a night, and we ended up with a 31% attempt somewhere in there. People were confident we could get him down, and we ended up going 2 more hours - the longest we have raided in a long time. That didn't end up so well however, as the next 2 hours yielded constant wipes of 50-80%.<br>
<br>
We did about 39 attempts total I believe. We had deaths from falling even on our last hour of the night, which was unexcusable of course, deaths from grip + airburst, though that happened rarely and we managed to keep people alive who had it for the last half of our attempts, and of course the MT dying, though he died in 3 attempts out of the 39.<br>
<br>
Our main problem was doomfire. No matter how much I emphasized staying away from it and such, it seems like at some point we would always get a bunch of people hit by it. <br>
<br>
We tried bunching behind him at first, but air-burst ended up hitting too many people constantly, and we had doomfires that just generally covered the entire area at times. We ended up switching to having groups "positioned" around Archimonde. Though doomfires seem to be spread out a bit, it seemed to me like the number of people getting hit by it wasn't any lower then when we were all directly behind him. We also had incidents where people just ended up getting isolated from their groups and dying to a grip or doomfire.<br>
<br>
This fight is very frustrating. I am personally very hardcore about content, so I have no problem wiping over and over, but i'm more overly worried about how it might be a guild breaker, since it does seem to be very demoralizing wiping that much AND that fast so easily.<br>
<br>
Sorry for the long rant, my questions were basically, do you guys even position your raid properly? It seemed to me like there was no point to doing that, since doomfires had no proper pathing from what I saw, and eventually just got people away from the main group, and those people usually died. Also, is it worth doing/repeating it? Would we be better off working on Relinquary of Souls? It seems to me like even though we will be able to handle RoS better since I hear its 100% execution, we would hit Mother Shahraz and still be left to do one of the two blocks either way, so it seems like I would only be delaying the inevitable.<br>
<br>
This fight seems so doable, yet so...hard at the same time. I don't think I have ever felt so frustrated at a fight before. Perhapes we might get "lucky" eventually and beat it, but it does feel like it's not worth it to even attempt to repeat it.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_429706"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Your experience sounds typical for archimonde.  You would kill him tomorrow almost for sure had it not been a reset.  You would have 2 hours of unbroken time on him where now everyone actually knows how to kill him, and you would get lucky basically once in that time frame - no strat change, no player change, no class change - he would just magically go from 70% to dead; thats how this fight works sadly.<br>
<br>
Honestly, I've seen guilds kill him on their first wipe night due to good luck, and then not be able to repeat the task for 2 more raid days because they killed him the first time so quickly.  This is another one of those "2 raid sessions and its dead" bosses.  Which so far for us still applies to everyone but Kael'thas.  Its just far more frustrating somehow - and it should take a good guild about 50 wipes to kill Archimonde the first time (contrary to the reports here that 6 pulls and he's free loot).  <br>
<br>
As for doomfire, if there is a doomfire in the east, we have the entire raid shift away from the east - it is now a biohazard zone.  We can get to the point where no one in the raid is affected by doomfire beyond 1-2 folks the entire fight.  I think our guild is quite good at this fight now since we can all react appropriately - I certainly don't see our strat or players improving.  <br>
<br>
At this point in our progression though, hearts are much more valuable to us than Archimonde loot, and we actually gave up attempts on him to farm hearts... that sums up my feelings on Archimonde.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>ISP problems and blizzard being shit at coding raid instances in general are hardly encounter specific. I've not experienced the falling through the world myself there, but well that's just crap that happens and I doubt they fix that soon. They are notoriously awful at fixing stuff that takes them serious work, so if you plan to kill archimonde within the next 2-3 weeks, waiting for that to happen makes not much sense.<br>
I really don't wnat to know how many times we wiped to Al'ar cause he just randomly flew up 30y and aoe'ed us. Or when he charge/1 shotted 3 healers in a row early on. This shit happens and it will happen. The only real solution is to delete your char, otherwise it will happen again.<br>
<br>
If you try Archimone for more then two raid days and blame wipes on impossible situations, you're lying at yourself. Make people bring decurse pots, get more hp on everyone, bring more shamans/decursers, if everythign else fails. And sort the positioning better.<br>
Back for Thaddius we had a black list of guys we just would not take to the fight, both ISP/computer wise and just not being fast enough with the running (although we did use arrows, but I'll not start to get unfriendly here :p).

</div>This could possibly be one of the best arguments yet that Archimonde needs a change - when it's a better option for your guild to just farm trash mobs than attempt to kill the last boss in a raid instance. Doesn't something like this just seem absurdly wrong, especially a lore figure as important as Archimonde?

				<div style="font-style:italic">I hate to ask for advice, but this fight really gets to me...<br>
<br>
We did our first round of attempts last night. We brought something like 5 shamans, 4 decursers, and about 9 healers, so we had a "stacked" raid for the most part. <br>
<br>
...<br>
<br>
Sorry for the long rant, my questions were basically, do you guys even position your raid properly?</div>

	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>Your group makeup is similar to ours.  I believe that splitting up the raid has some advantages. <br>
<br>
Stick the melee in the center and create four equal groups.  Each group should have a shaman, decurser, and 2 healers.  Balance the groups the best you can and mark each shaman with a raid icon.  The shaman becomes the homing beacon for the rest of the group, and they should move around together (as best as possible).  If you do not have a shaman for one of the groups, stack the group with players that have the best counters: 2 minute pvp trinkets, wotf, fear ward, divine shield, dispel, etc.  A priest/paladin pair can alternate fear breaks and dispell their group as quickly as a shaman (on average).  The four groups should be split up evenly around Archimonde.  <br>
<br>
As a result, you should be fairly resilient against doomfires.  If a group is threatened by fire, they can run completely out and away of the fight, (ideally) staying within both healing and decursing range of each other.  This gives people more freedom to run away without worrying that the tank or melee group will be left without support.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Kaib, I'm not quite sure who you're talking to, and you seem personally offended that many people dislike the fight... but the last time we did archimonde it took us about 90 minutes to repeat a kill.  I was very clear in my post about why we didn't attempt him this week.  <br>
<br>
I think you really should read posts first before replying.  Its really amazing to read something like that.  We're not waiting for anything to be "fixed" on archimonde.  And your ego is amazing; why anyone would make such a post on EJ is beyond me.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_430266"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->We got to him last night, and wiped for 4 hours straight today, with 50% beeing best attempt. We would probably have downed him if we didnt spend the first hour with the "old" positioning tactic, instead of spreading out in a 360 fasion, which leads me to believe it isnt "that" random. We had our fair share of wipes due to fear+grip+doomfire+airborne, but most of the wipes were l2p issues regarding the tears, or people not thinking ahead when it came to doomfires and fears. Confident we will kill him next reset if we dont get an unlucky streak of the above mentioned.<br>
<br>
As for my role in this fight, the main tank, i think he should be able to crush(like quigon mentioned) and hit for less, simply because a parry or 2 can kill you. One of our pulls today, i went in and shieldslammed him, half a second later i was dead due to it beeing parried <br>
I have no issues with the fear tho, and i dont really understand why alot of the tanks here whine about it. I havent saved my GCD for it yet, and in a worst case scenario im feared for 0.1 seconds, harddly enough to kill anyone(never did either in our 25 odd attempts). Had a couple oh shit moments with him fearing early tho, but nothing the old pvp trinket cant fix, although its something that should be fixed imo.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_430277"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->One fatal thing we sometimes have, which almost always results in a death is the MT being burst down within 2seconds on the pull (We all mount for it).<br>
<br>
He goes in with PW:S, ES, PoM, as soon as he hits the boss he recieves Rejuv which is SM'd as soon as its needed, however sometimes the only way to counter the burst is with a NS heal which results in the healer getting agro and getting one shot more often than not. Before you ask he does get MD'd as quickly as he can however its not always fast enough when the healers dont have time to wait.<br>
<br>
It doesn't happen often... only 3-4 times in total sofar (1 + 1/2 raid days) but its just one thing I'ld like to remove if possible to cut down on the &lt;60second wipes of stupidity <!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_430278"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I don't see how crushes would help prevent parry deaths - quite the opposite. Faster hits means your Shield Block charges will be gone and he can crush you to death. Unless you aim for passive immunity, but then you would have to drop a considerable amount of hitpoints just for that. It might prevent Fear Ward'ed druids from tanking him though, or at least make it worse than it is now.<br>

<br>
Latency != lag spike - it's completely compensatable. Heigan was 100% following a set pattern on a bunch of set timers. So was Thaddius.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, there's no real way to anticipate short casts as on Archimonde's fear and RoS p2... and barring Blizzard somehow adding some sort of advance warning, which would make the encounters cheese for non-high-ping guilds, I don't really see what could be done.<br>
<br>
We'll see what happens, I guess. I'm not particularly worried about Archimonde - Iron Chefs, another Oceanic guild, raped him without the benefit of fear ward even.<br>
<br>
edit:- to highlight the RoS issue, we have four things we need to look at<br>
1) That "interrupt but didn't" bugginess Praetorian highlighted where interrupts landing in the last 0.2 to 0.1 secs don't actually stop the cast even though they read interrupt.<br>
2) Latency of 400-500ms on a good day<br>
3) Needing to see if it's a Deaden or Shock. Lets say an amazingly fast reaction time of 0.3secs<br>
4) Purging shields.<br>

I really don't see how it's going to fall in place. :/ Meh, I'll take this line of discussion over to the RoS thread... getting wa-ay off topic here. Apologies.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>This is really overstated.  We have an aussie interrupt on Desire.  Just use an offtank and you'll be fine.  Cast times for most casts are 1.6 seconds or so?<br>
<br>
Seriously, as the main tank I've been hit with spirit shock like 7 times and we still made it to phase 3 with 25 people up.  Although on our kill-shot I was only hit once.  Just plan for it to happen, because it really will happen about a third of the time when the shield goes up.  You're dealing with human beings here!  <br>
<br>
As for deaden, the timing on it is so tight that unless it casts early, I hit reflect when the bigwigs timer disappears and it reflects it every-last-time, in the dark.  Shielded deadens are simply too fast when you want to be focusing on other things.  You can reflect deaden blind.  Also assign 1 person to blind-interrupt the second the deaden goes off.  EoD actually queues spells up.  If two people interrupt at the same time - you can interrupt spirit shock, and then deaden 0.0000001 seconds later.  This works in reverse when a spirit shock is due after a deaden.  Anyway theres some leet beta infoz right there.  <br>
<br>
All that being said - I don't want to sound like an ego raving maniac saying "learn to play".  Your points are important when it comes to unfair timings and things that need to be addressed in "the real world."  These fights do not appear to be tested on crappy computers over laggy connections.  We've seen this on a number of fights, and it is disconcerting.  We've already seen combat logs of nearly unavoidable issues related to lag.  <br>
I've actually seen someone die to Tears of the Goddess not firing due to a horrendous lag spike.  I've heard in a few cases this happens - but people always insult them saying "you didn't click."  The reality is sometimes lag can actually hit you at the worst times there.  (Although this is fleetingly rare, maybe once in 70ish attempts ever).  And once when we were practicing on the hills.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Once you have Shahraz down, you will wonder what/why it had taken you so long, with capped SR, it is not hard to repeat.  I wouldn't say it is any harder than Archimonde or Illidan, or RoS for that matter.<br>

As for the difficulty of archimonde, its been stated so many times in this thread, if you can stack shaman, do it, it makes the fight managable and with decent raid positioning I would expect to kill it within 5 tries everytime.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Illidan is still the hardest fight in the game right now imo, with Council/RoS second and Kael/Archimonde third (Kael because of difficulty, Archimonde because of needing to anti-fear stack). <br>
<br>
The only things that wipe us on Shahraz are stupid things like lash on a tank who has been knocked in the air, FA on top of the camp (which is to do with our tactic more than anything else), and other things like Cow Range making it hard to position the offtanks so they actually get hit (we normally use deviates to get round this).<br>
<br>
I'm wondering whether you consider the need to farm trash for 10 hours to make a kill even remotely possible a better mechanic than anti-fear stacking for Archimonde. In my opinion resistance fights are worse than total fear fights, because although you can counter fear with tremor/wotf/trinkets/etc, resistance can sometimes just make someone die because they got unlucky with resists while capped on whichever resistance.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

With a solid plan for BOP'd casting you're fine, and they can heal a fair amount without dire consequences--it just makes the fight last longer.

</div>Those trinkets are farmed from PvP, and tremors from stacking shamans, and wotf/fear ward from racials.  Thats pretty dumb man.  <br>
Shahraz is indeed partly a terrible fight because it requires resists, but that doesn't somehow make archimonde a better fight - one fight being bad is not at odds with another!  I've heard from a number of guilds though that Illidan took them 2 nights, and was relatively simple - wouldn't that make Kael'thas harder?  And, afaik, every guild that has killed illidan and Archifun kills Illidan much more repeatably.  Illidan may be a hard fight - but most guilds do it in under a week, and repeat with 1-2 shots, does that not sum up your experience?  But hey, they must have lied to me because our guild hasn't killed shahraz.<br>
<br>
Difficulty is really a matter of guild specific opinion as well.<br>
I think that Reliquary of souls is more around Anatheron's difficulty honestly (but thats based on our experience).  The hardest part of reliquary was for new guilds to learn his abilities - and put that knowledge to use on a kill - reflecting deadens probably cost some guilds a week of progression.  But for guilds arriving at reliquary today, they'll know all the abilities and be able to drop it on 1-2 nights easily.  This is a good example of how knowledge is power on a fight, and makes it significantly easier over time (this was mentioned by Tigole in some encounter designs; see: 4H).  <br>
<br>
Farming for resist gear does suck though.  It does make the fight much easier - so once everyone is at 365 perhaps it will turn into a readily repeatable and trivial kill.  But thus far it has given most guilds the biggest stoppage (except early with RoS) in progression.  So perhaps over time as guilds take longer to get there and get more hearts in the process it will magically dissolve into "just another fight."  However, just looking at EJ for instance, they appear to have spent the most time on shahraz - and truly hate the fight; and will probably drop illidan their next raid session with any luck, that seems to reflect what I've seen elsewhere.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_430918"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I don't think Shahraz is a terrible fight because it requires resists.  You need 150 hearts plus some greens to do the fight.  By the time you get to her, unless you progressed through the first 2/3 of BT in like 2 weeks, you should have close to 100 hearts banked (we did through Akama week one, Teron and Gurtogg week two, took two weeks off from BT progression to clear Hyjal, then did RoS the next week, and we had 100).  Farming up the other 50 should take a few days, and honestly is pretty fun if you just do it casually, at random hours of the day.  We had a great time clearing all the way to Shahraz with 8 people late one night (one PvP-spec warrior as the only tank, me and a paladin as the only healers).  We just used straight Need/Greed for all epic gems that dropped throughout the farming period, making it really profitable for everyone.<br>
<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I don't think Shahraz is a terrible fight because it requires resists.  You need 150 hearts plus some greens to do the fight.  By the time you get to her, unless you progressed through the first 2/3 of BT in like 2 weeks, you should have close to 100 hearts banked (we did through Akama week one, Teron and Gurtogg week two, took two weeks off from BT progression to clear Hyjal, then did RoS the next week, and we had 100).  Farming up the other 50 should take a few days, and honestly is pretty fun if you just do it casually, at random hours of the day.  We had a great time clearing all the way to Shahraz with 8 people late one night (one PvP-spec warrior as the only tank, me and a paladin as the only healers).  We just used straight Need/Greed for all epic gems that dropped throughout the farming period, making it really profitable for everyone.<br>

</div>Yeah we used to farm pre-akama trash and got a lot of early epics and hearts this way as well (with as few as 5 people).<br>
<br>
Scheduling informal raids to farm trash is actually more fun than it sounds - especially if you try to do it with small groups and it becomes actually somewhat difficult.  I didn't realize you could go as 8 people on Shahraz trash, but we honestly never tried.  <br>
<br>
You tend to get more epics from the trash than bosses anyway - so it should be good incentive for people to show up.<br>
<br>
As to how much the randomness makes shahraz suck, well, its hard to comment on that.  So far my impression is that it is inconsistently random, meaning with solid execution you can push through when the cards are right (meaning some attempts you're doomed).  Having the leash though is pretty nice at least.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Quigon, I'm surprised you've made a statement concerning who you think is the hardest boss in TBC when you haven't even beaten the Shahraz fight yet (and by the sounds of it are still farming hearts). Illidan is still the hardest fight in the game right now imo, with Council/RoS second and Kael/Archimonde third (Kael because of difficulty, Archimonde because of needing to anti-fear stack). <br>
<br>
The only things that wipe us on Shahraz are stupid things like lash on a tank who has been knocked in the air, FA on top of the camp (which is to do with our tactic more than anything else), and other things like Cow Range making it hard to position the offtanks so they actually get hit (we normally use deviates to get round this).<br>
<br>
I'm wondering whether you consider the need to farm trash for 10 hours to make a kill even remotely possible a better mechanic than anti-fear stacking for Archimonde. In my opinion resistance fights are worse than total fear fights, because although you can counter fear with tremor/wotf/trinkets/etc, resistance can sometimes just make someone die because they got unlucky with resists while capped on whichever resistance.</div>

<br>
Illidan is hard the way Kael is hard.  It's long and has a lot of moving parts to keep track of.  And when you wipe you go all the way back to step one, which slows down learning.  Council has a fair bit to keep track of, but it's so forgiving and you see it all up front.  Take 4 tanks, put healers on them, and just focus on staying alive on Council and ignore healers and such, and you'll have it all figured out in 20 minutes.  I don't think Illidan is "hard" but it does have built-in obstacles you have to clear in order to see all the different parts of the fight.  And every mistake sends you back to the start with 10+ mins to spend in order to get back to where you were before.  Thus it takes a while.  It's a fun fight, though.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Err, everyone has a different list and different criteria as to who are the "hardest" bosses in the game. They may have different criteria or perhaps their guilds have different methods. They might not do Illidan as well as they do Reliquary. Judging based on how much time/effort it took to learn the boss, and how difficult each successive kill is, I would say that Council, Gurtogg, and Vashj are much easier than to Illidan, and Azgalor, Shahraz and Reliquary are <i>arguably</i> easier than Illidan.

		<div id="post_message_432884"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Personally I see Illidan's difficulty being concentrated on a few people, whereas Archimonde requires everyone in the raid to be playing reasonably well.<br>
<br>
Phase 2 is really the only hard part of Illidan, once you get past that it's pretty straightforward -- spread out, heal the tank, kill the stunners and parasites without getting too close to other people, and top everyone off.  The only really wipe-causing error is if your tank gets nailed on a transition or after the little cutscene, but saving NS for those cases mostly handles them.<br>
<br>
The vast, vast majority of our wipes on Illidan were to an elemental leashing and enraging or tanks not spotting an eye beam in time, or healers not being able to keep up when a tank stays in a Blaze or two, or accidentally turning an elemental towards to raid just as they do their frontal cone attack.  Once your tanks have phase 2 down, it isn't that bad at all.  But as a healer, it's pretty dull and simple actually...spam on tank....move to new position, and spam on tank...spread out and top folks off.  Not nearly as dynamic or interesting as Archimonde, though definitely more consistently repeatable.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>This.  I suppose you can analogize it to the primary difficulty of RoS being interrupts in p2, where you're really depending on a handful of people to do their job.  The difference from Illidan is that if a rogue mistimes a kick once, that's still completely recoverable.  If a tank stands in a beam or pulls an elemental too far away, your attempt is over instantly.  Your tanks have to be perfect.  The execution requirements on everyone else are fairly low compared to a fight like Archimonde or Shahraz.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>We did, he was in the MT healers group. I can see the bad luck situations popping up more often with less shamans/fear wards than we had. No doubt the raid damage would have been alot higher if we didn't have the makeup we did. I really hope this encounter is tweaked once again. Anything to help minimize the situations you can get into that will kill someone or really put an abrupt end to an attempt. <br>
<br>
Doomfire was the main issue for us. People getting into situations that just really made healing difficult is what wiped us so many attempts. A better approach would be the locking on a player. Maybe spawning it on someone in the raid, giving them 2 seconds to get out of it before being debuffed, and allowing you to control where it goes may make the encounter more enjoyable, but probably alot easier. <br>
<br>
The bad luck situations are the timers. The grip+fear combo is always bad. Setting it so the fear timer is static and setting the grip to those that aren't airburst are a good start to making this encounter enjoyable. I could live with doomfires erratic behavior if they made it so dumb situations like I mentioned never happened. Is it repeatable? Yes. Am I looking forward to it? No. Grip+fear/stupid fear through doomfire+airburst+grip is the quick way to toss 5g and whatever stoneshields/ironshields I used down the drain. It may be rare, but that attempt when it happens sure is depressing.<br>
<br>
For those who were wondering our attempts were basically 70% or greater. Once we analyzed what people were doing with doomfire we just laid out the rule if it spawns in your area just get away from it. Too many people were just standing there waiting to see where it went and then having it lock onto them and getting hit. We also watched people trap themselves and told them if it starts to circle you run to archimonde and get out of it before you're closed in, etc. Believe the next two attempts were 50 something and 40% to dead.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

2.  "Tank move!" *tank takes 1 step" "MORE!"  *zap*<br>
3.  Tank died.<br>
<br>
I'm not saying 2 of those 3 aren't entirely our fault...but the tank dying, honestly, is that a learning curve thing?  I mean, is it new that an enemy can do decent dmg to a tank, while aoeing the raid?  If so, I guess I've been sleeping through WoW raiding.  #2...yea it requires TWO people to actively dodge something.  If this is what defines a challenging fight, well, *shrug*.<br>
<br>
On p3 onward, I think we wiped 1 or 2 times total to people being retarded/having to see it to believe it?  P3 and P4 are sooo forgiving though. On our kill attempt, we did decently to ~15-20%, then a spriest pulls aggro on a transition, dies and gets like 6-8 others killed, while healing Illidan for what, 10-15%?  We still pulled a kill out of it.<br>
<br>
I truly believe that Illidan is one of the easier fights to learn AND execute in BT.  (our 2nd kill was wipe a few times to same things as above in p2 while ~20 people play perfectly, then 1 shot p3).<br>
Also, we definitely spent more time learning Bloodboil and Souls than Illidan.  Gorefiend is probably about equal.  We spent more time learning Blind, Morogrim, Lurker, Hydross, Alar, Magtheridon, and Gruul than Illidan as well.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">How can you make this claim about Thaddius?  Heigan's Acid Splashes are absolutely 100% predictable, but there's no way to predict on Thaddius which charge you will get, thus pointing you to which camp to run to (or stay at, depending on your method - we used circular, i.e. 4 points).</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>In context of the original post, I was pointing out that a latency is not an insta-gib on Thaddius, since a 4-point strategy (which we used back then too) helps to combat the extra 500-600ms all of us experienced. This is in contrast to a lag-spike at a bad time, which WILL wipe the raid (or on Heigan, get you killed). Basically, I was saying that, back then,  people who rely on "latency" and "my character was at the correct spot on my screen!@#" as an excuse probably had no idea what they were talking about or how the game/net code worked.<br>
<br>
(Also, 'predictable' in this case refered to the strict timing that the Polarity Shifts adhered to, including the huge ball lightning animation that served as a "get ready to move, remember where the heck to go on both possibilities" warning)<br>
<br>
In the even bigger context of the original post, I was also contrasting this 'not-a-valid-excuse' argument to RoS interruping - 0.5 secs off a 1.5 (or 0.8) cast seems like a much steeper penalty for having that high a ping.</div>

</div>We attempted RoS once I believe, bashed against 12-wave garbage Hyjal trash for a while, then finally came back after Archimonde and got RoS on our 2nd night there?  RoS wasn't crazy hard or anything, we weren't wiping for a month, I guarantee you.  Was just a mix of still doing SSC/TK, trying to progress in Hyjal, then the Hyjal nerf for a week, and the fact our BB kill was late on a Monday night, that it took us a while before we actually did more than a "peek" at RoS.<br>
<br>
Illidan on the other hand, well, we have yet to wipe to p3 after the first time seeing p3...and p2 is still a joke.  Illidan is 1-shottable on your 2nd kill onward, with ease.  Oh, and your first kill should probably early on your 2nd night of attempts IF NOT on your first night.<br>
<br>
As for guides and whatnot, I fail to see how that really matters.  Most guides out there are wrong, in fact, I'd say more than half are written by someone who watches a video, uses thottbot a bit, and tries to piece together small bits from here and there.  It would be catastrophic to follow these guides.  The fact remains, you dont even need a guide for Illidan.  The fight is so simple, so straight forward, there is little to nothing to explain.  Explaining fights to new apps on vent...it takes me near the entire trash clear to Kael to explain that fight...Illidan, I can explain in the time it takes to run from Council's room to his.</div>

I'm not sure why so many people feel that claiming something is too easy or too hard to better the game somehow reflects on their own player skill, and therefore ego speaks rather than common sense.

				<div style="font-style:italic">While this might not be fair for everyone, especially people who do not have localized servers (eg. Australians), I generally expect someone who is playing a fast paced online game to have a latency of no more than 300ms at worst. 800+ms is a huge handicap on a lot of encounters. If the game was designed with that latency in mind, it would be boring for those with a good connection.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>I don't agree with the fact that over 300 is unplayable.My latency bar is green/yellow (250-350) most of the times and I can find myself adapting to that latency easily.Spikes however are unpredictable, a second of spike would make you miss a shieldblock and may get you instagibbed.As long as the latency bar IS stable , this game is easily playable.<br>
<br>
Edit : Although what I say may not go well with Archimonde encounter.</div>

</div>Phase 1 you think took learning?  Yes, we knew something about p1 Illidan.  I would have much preferred not having videos released.  It was much nicer before when the top guilds had the courtesy to not ruin content quite so early.  I fully understand some people want to see the videos/etc, it seems very rude to release videos before multiple guilds have killed a boss, however.<br>
<br>
So let's assume we watched no videos...is there something in P1 that took more learning than 1 attempt?  Move out of the fire?  Is that complex to you?<br>
<br>
But for a guild who can so reliably kill every boss people complain about, it sure took you a while to clear Hyjal.  Oh wait, that's what happened.  We engaged RoS a few times 1 night, got to p2 (BTW, we had 1 rogue in the guild total, who was on vacation at the time), then we decided since *gasp* content is being released side-by-side, we would work on other content.  But anyway, umm, what about RoS is so hard to learn?  To spell reflect?  RoS if anything, is execution, not learning curve.<br>
<br>
As for p3 Illidan, yes, we saw 1 video before we got to him.  That saved us umm, well, I would have said 1 wipe in p3, but some people decided to ignore what I said anyway and didn't back off enough on demon phase/etc.  We wiped anyway our first time on p3 due to multiple errors, people misjudging range on the shadow blast, people not snaring the demon things, and we thought at first we'd try just ignoring the traps (which is viable, but rougher on healers).  There are things that can go wrong, but nothing complex, in the least.  Spread out, snare, kill add things quickly..that's it!  Oh, and on our first kill, like I said, things went terribly wrong, and we -STILL- 15-manned the last 20%.  Does that sound appropriately challenging to you?  Litle over half a raid managed the kill?<br>
<br>
Go ahead and bash us on RoS more because we didn't try because we felt our timer was better spent elsewhere.  While you're at it, go back to Naxx and bash us for killing Thaddius well behind where we were on progression for the rest of Naxx.  We obviously are a terrible guild, and I have no clue what I'm talking about.  We only killed KT 2nd because we watched a video of Celebrity killing him first.</div>

<br>
Did anyone get definitive answers regarding SR and resisting silence? I know a priest that claims that when he uses it, he *does* resist more fears. He has talents in anti-fear. And of course any person without anti-fear talents can never resist it as far as I know.<br>
<br>
What came to mind when I heard this was:<br>
<br>
Players without anti-fear talents cannot resist fear, regardless of SR.<br>
Players with anti-fear talents can resist the fear... and somehow lets SR also play a part? Bug in the resist code? Intended? Am I going insane?<br>
<br>
Probably!</div>

</div>I didn't wear SR last night because the first few attempts it wasn't helping at all. Your player may have been exaggerating.<br>
<br>
He isn't really hard by the way, Rogues do the DPS and everyone else just baits the Doomfires. If you have people who die to doomfire, you lose =\ Hopefully tonight everyone who was sucking learns to play.<br>
<br>
Didn't find Shaman as useful as everyone claims, decursers who know how to decurse and people staying away from Doomfire is all Archimonde requires.</div>

Unforuately swivel comes across quite blunt most the time, and i know we would have had a hell of a time doing any of the bosses had we not had the right composition as to what was needed as you've stated with only having 1 rogue can hinder things at ROS as can not having optimal classes for certain encounters slow you right down. As a guild we have a lot of respect for guilds that are at the top of the progression for it is those guilds we set our targets on replicating and risen as well as many other guilds who are represented on these forums are in that top bracket of guilds that we pushed hard to get into, in terms of recognition celebrity are still a fairly new guild to the scene, but hopefully 1 day we can get to the same standing as Risen, EJ and other guilds,<br>
<br>
Also to get back on the topic of the thread,<br>
<br>
I don't think any of our healers have worn shadow resist and more than getting the priest buff, a big part of this comes down to if we are horde and our tank has that split second delay in getting his zerk rage, that poor soul that resisted the fear is primary target for extermination, so to allow archimond to run back to the tank people take a few seconds fear as long as they are safe, and some healers are in the shamen group for the totem which will tick a couple of seconds into the fear</div>

		<div id="post_message_434478">We have attempted this fight for 3 or 4 nights now and I can definitely understand the view of people that would rather farm towards Mother than work on this fight week after week.  I was hoping to get a bit of advice from the gurus in this forum.  <br>
<br>
At the moment we only have 2 shaman available to us and one dwarf priest (We wont have the option of stacking more shaman for at least a week or 2 as any recruit we will have to bang through KT and Vash'j).  We do have an abundance of decursers as we usually have 4-5 mages and 1-2 resto druids along with a feral that during "hey melee watchout" moments can drop back and at least keep himself decursed along with others near him.  <br>
<br>
We position the raid around 4 ranged dps/healer/decurser groups and send them to the compass points around Archi basically.  Our tank pulls from the east and then 4 is north 5 is west, 1 (tank group) is east and 3 is south of him.  The ranged groups are told to move with their decursers who are marked.  We generally have 8 or 9 healers (3-4 pallies) and have no trouble keeping the tank up at all.  It is other deaths that are causing the chains.  Most often fire-related.   <br>
<br>
Overall, I think we have progressed somewhat satisfactorily, but it is just a nasty (and somewhat demoralizing) fight.  We have lived 7.5 to 8  minutes on a number of occasions getting him into the mid-30s percentage-wise and our dps (3 rogues and a couple of affliction locks doing the majority of the damage with some decent shadow priest dps thrown in) looks to be fine in terms of getting him to 10% pre-enrage.  <br>
<br>
It is just always one-thing or another on this fight.  If doomfire is under control, it seems like a decurser gets punted into the well and silenced, then cursed.  If fire and no weird punts occur, a warlock disconnects and is killed in the doomfire.  If that doesn't happen, someones screen freezes up while being airbursted and they crater.  bleh.  <br>
<br>
Is it really just a matter of keeping at it until the stars align and he falls over, or is there some flaw with our positioning that any of you can identify?  So far its only been 3 nights and KT certainly took us much longer to learn, but I guess the lack of trash and correspondingly much larger number of attempts have the emo-levels in our guild much higher at the moment, lol.  Any thoughts would be appreciated.</div>

		<div id="post_message_434499">You need to look at each problem you get and gradually eliminate them. If you're getting people punted into the well, there's a pretty easy solution to that - don't stand in line with it. We use 3 groups, one towards the run in spot (towards Tyrande pretty much), and the other two at equal points away from that. People just need to be aware of where they are and make sure that if they are running towards where they could be punted into the well, that they take account of that and move further towards Archi or back round again.<br>
<br>
If you're having screen freezes and disconnects, and its consistently happening to the same people, replace them if you can. It sounds harsh, but reliability is a big problem in the fight in general.<br>
<br>
You can also dispel the fear, so if you can get three groups with a fear warded priest in one, and dispellers with the shamans in the other, then they can dispel the decursers (if needed) or anyone heading towards a fire. It helps a lot.</div>

</div>It's not quite that bad (although the melee do end up in some very weird spots sometimes)! There's certainly a lot of room that groups can move around in. Sometimes you even find yourself standing next to another decurser (we put raid marks on decursers heads, makes it easier) and then realise you're almost 90 degrees out of position. It's not a problem though really - doomfire runs out and you get back in position pretty quickly. <br>
<br>
You just have to really drill it into everyone that their primary goal is to stay alive, and taking pots and using healthstones is the only way that's going to happen if you assume people make mistakes. You can even have deaths, just as long as that death (that hopefully was completely unavoidable - we've had a couple of people who could swear the World Tree has stealth) doesn't cause a lot more deaths.</div>

</div>You just stated near enough what we do. Everyone stands close enough so that hopefully if they get bursted, the decurser does too. If not, the decurser is a druid (travel form) or a mage (blink) and so they can get there easily, and because they were standing next to them, they just saw them disappear off the screen so they can run towards them for a "just in case" scenario.<br>
<br>
I'm pretty sure it's mentioned in a few places in this thread, just as a comment in passing though.</div>

		<div id="post_message_434658">Yeah there were only a couple minor problems I saw with it. 1. Fear/doomfire/burst separating people, in which case you could join the nearest icon'd decurse group and slowly make your way back to your designated decurser as doomfire allows. 2. Possible problems with range on tremor, but you can just structure groups around decursers. And 3. More people getting hit by each air burst, resulting in more chances for "oh tears doesn't work in feral form gg blizz" (ok that only happened once, but was amusing) or "I lagged when I clicked tears" or some variation. In practice it's probably not really many, if any, more people getting hit by each air burst with the clumps unless your guild is just super-humanly amazing at dynamically forming uniform distributions of players in an area that constantly changes size/shape with doomfire.</div>

		<div id="post_message_434694">After last week which featured no Archimonde kill (people apparently couldn't figure out that walking into the multi-meter tall flames was, in fact, bad for them) our RL declared that all DPS classes were to come back next raid in full FR. Wonder of wonders, we one-shot him easily when we easily wasted a full raid day on him last week.<br>
<br>
The question is: Does FR really do a thing to prevent doomfire? People provided glowing reports of partial resists on the doomfire DoT, and even full resists of the actual application. Me? I ran with 314 buffed, and I noticed no mitigation at all on the 4 total doomfire ticks I took before jumping into the well. I do think I fully resisted the application once or twice, but it could very possibly have been the graphic persisting when the fire itself was out.<br>
<br>
One thing that really did help by putting on FR was the increase in stamina; even with Hyjal/BT gear, FR gear provided a substantial (~1.5K) bonus to my health. It might have been a psychosomatic thing?</div>

</div>I'm a priest. I have 15% fear/silence resist from talents. On Kazrogal and Azgalor, I wear somewhere in the ballpark of 200+ SR (it's been a while since I've checked after itemracking). On those fights, it's noticeable how often I would resist the drain or silence abilities. Shadow resist increases my DPS, in that light, so it was a logical choice.<br>
<br>
Archimonde comes along, and I'm in a non-shaman group with wotf/2min-trinket. ANY amount of good shadow resist was going to increase my DPS, because of the following: 8 seconds of fear (no DPS), having to stay 8 seconds away from doomfires with a 24yd cast range (no DPS), and having to deal with an unfortunate doomfire with my own survivability options (less DPS). I immediately slapped on my 200+ SR itemrack (along with instructing others to do the same), and we went through three wipes (~15 fears) without any change in resist of fear.<br>
<br>
Either mine or your priest's case are purely anecdotal, but I've never been done wrong on Kazrogal / Azgalor. I'd love to see a WWS of your priest's night of attempts. If I saw a ~50% resist rate, I would probably change my tune.</div>

In retrospect we were insane to try it with 2 shaman.  It was incomparably easier with 2 more (even though one was a mage's alt that we rushed through attunements and is still undergeared.  Took us only 3 attempts first time we zoned in with more than 2 shaman, after 3 solid nights of wiping on the encounter where we had a number of near misses (20% wipes like 4 or 5 times).  It is possible to do the encounter with fewer shaman, but I would seriously advise guilds that are operating under the shaman-lacking circumstances that we were to wait for the change to the encounter in the next patch before you attempt it.  Go learn Bloodboil and Reliquary in the meantime.</div>

</div>First of all, you need to deal with the issues of people dying to stupid reasons pretty quickly. If your raid isn't competent enough to decurse, use the tears, or avoid doomfires, then you either need to quickly make them competent, or abandon attempts on Archimonde until they're comeptent enough frankly. If you have a lot of people who are simply dying for stupid reasons, then you're better off without them in the raid at all - 20 people who aren't going to die are much better than 20 people who aren't going to die and 5 people who are on this fight.<br>
<br>
I'm not sure why you would intentionally try to have half your ranged CC'd basically the entire fight - he casts Airbursts frequently. Bring Purification Potions to deal with Grip + Burst. Spread your ranged out more, we use 4 camps, one for each point of the compass, and the ranged understand that their positioning is rough and they're intended to just try to be in the area when Doomfires are not present, and clear the fuck out whenever a Doomfire is present.<br>
<br>
3 tremors should be ample. I'd assume one of the shamans is enhancement, so definitely keep him in there for the melee DPS and tremors for melee, and spread the other two out, focusing on giving them to healers and decursers. I reccomend fear warding a healer, and getting your tank to stance dance (make sure your DPS warriors know they need to break fears AFTER the tank, because there is a chance that he'll kill a DPS warrior even if your tank catches the fear otherwise).<br>
<br>
Above all else you need to emphasize that this fight is about survival first, everything else secondary. If everyone in the raid stays alive for 10 minutes, Archimonde will be dead, end of story. The enrage timer should not be a consideration.</div>

People who lack the situational awareness to notice that they're just standing in a source of damage probably shouldn't be in your raid. Cratering is an even easier thing to avoid, frankly - if you haven't yet, try practicing jumping off the cliff near Tyrande.

		<div id="post_message_442358">We have the same problem. Our first kill on Archimonde was last week, no deaths, really clean kill. Thought we could repeat this fairly easily, how wrong I was. <br>
<br>
We came back this week multiple times (2 hours on thursday, 2 hours on saturday, about an hour and a half today) and failed to kill him. We have 5 shamans for tremors in each group, and about 4 decursers. We didn't exactly bring the same raid as our first kill, but yeah, a lot of stupid things at this point. There are factors in this fight that comes down solely to luck, but ultimately, having wipe to this guy for so long, it's always the same people catching doomfire and dying, being away from the raid with doomfire then catching grip and dying etc.<br>
<br>
I don't even know what to think anymore really, I hate this fight with a passion. We got our first kill on Mother Shahraz today, came back to Archimonde with high hopes we did kill him, but failed to. On each day of attempts, we had one &lt;20% wipe each. How we break down at that point, I have no idea. What should I be blaming at this point? I'm really out of ideas. Emphasizing survival and such does nothing. People still die to doomfire simply because too many are taking it, or taking it along with a grip and not getting decursed in time and such.<br>
<br>
EDIT: Just a question to guilds that have killed him. Do you consider him on "farm"? Have you ever rotted him and such just because he wasn't worth the effort? I'm highly thinking about doing that just to finish BT.</div>

		<div id="post_message_442363">Not to sound like a prick, but the fight should be fairly easy if everyone in the raid is getting a tremor totem. I've killed him both having and not having a tremor totem in my group, and honestly the difference in avoiding Doomfires is night and day. . . without a tremor totem I have to plan to be at least 30 yards away from any Doomfire when a fear is coming, whereas with a tremor totem I'm generally safe at least 15 yards away. Also, my DPS time increases dramatically with a tremor totem, you spend a lot less time feared.<br>
<br>
If it's the same people who are actually dying first on each attempt, you need to deal with them however your guild deals with people who are wiping you. If you use SWS, it has a nifty log feature for everyone in the raid so you can see why they're dying. /SWL and it's pretty self-explanatory. If they can't fix their performance, you NEED to remove them from the raid. Tell them that you have to replace them if they can't improve their performance.<br>
<br>
One thing that can help a lot is to have one of your more capable players watching the fear cooldown timer. 5 seconds before the cooldown is up, and then every 10-15 seconds, have him verbally remind the raid over vent that the fear is coming, the fear is coming, the fear is coming. For us at least, it helps the raid remember to focus on getting away from any and all Doomfires in their area.<br>
<br>
Once your raid isn't dying to Doomfires, it should only be the relatively hard to control combos such as grip + burst that wipe you. Have the raid bring or your guild bank might be able to supply the raid with Purification Potions. People should save their potion cooldowns for survival potions, such as Purification Potions and health / protection potions, rather than use them on DPS pots like haste, destruction, and if they can avoid it, mana.<br>
<br>
As far as skipping him, we skipped all of Hyjal this week to make sure we'd have time to get our first Illidan kill. Archimonde's loot table is all very good, though, he has the same ilvl as Illidan does, and nothing he drops will get sharded really. On the other hand, you can basically do all of BT/ Hyjal in Karazhan / crafted gear, so it's not like you really need the loot.</div>

		<div id="post_message_442365">We've killed Archimonde every week, except for the week we pushed to kill Illidan. I consider him on farm status somewhat, but he is definitely the encounter that takes us the longest to repeat week after week. It takes us a few hours every week to get it down. Sometimes it'll take no time and others we'll spend hours. Constantly throughout the fight I am telling people to be cautious; to be extremely cautious. My damage on that fight is next to nothing, barely more than our main tank sometimes. I could certainly do more, but melee dps does so much more damage to Archimonde that they practically win the fight for you if you can stay up for 7 minutes. We always have a group of 3 rogues, 1 feral druid, and 1 fear warded shaman. Every range dps class needs to realize that their damage is meaningless and the number one thing for them is survival. When the fear cool down is up no range should be anywhere near doom fires. If that means they can't dps for a solid 30 seconds, so be it. <br>
<br>
Normally we bring 2-3 Shamans and 2 Fear Wards, but this week we only had 1 Shaman and 1 Fear Ward. Like others have said, the more shamans you bring the better off you are.</div>

		<div id="post_message_442573">I consider Archimonde solidly on farm. We probably would have one shot him this week if it wasn't for a Spirit of Redemption priest dying -- can't wait for that bug to be fixed.  So we just killed him on the 2nd pull instead.  <br>
<br>
Keep in mind that we usually bring 5 shamans for this though.  If you have a shaman in every group, and you have a pvp trinket as backup, there's really very little excuse anyone has for dying.  <br>
<br>
Understand something about Doomfire -- it will hit some people occasionally and it's hardly the end of the world.  This is not a healing intensive fight otherwise.  Otherwise, as Zwink said, ranged classes need to think survival first.  DPS is something I do inbetween making sure I'm away from Doomfires.  This is not the fight to try to squeeze in extra DPS or try to top the charts -- which is going to be melee anyways.  Nobody is going to look at an Archimonde parse for DPS evaluations, so forget about it.   If you do 600 DPS and never get hit by Doomfire, you're infinitely more valuable than someone who does 1000 DPS and gets hit all the time.</div>

</div>One of our holy priests definitely was able to resist the fear with resist, and he did have a talent i believe.  No other healers were able to get a resist so we stopped trying resist.   Our shadow priests resisted some fears and were dispelling them.  That helped a decent bit at avoiding doomfire.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
To Illundai:<br>
<br>
Some advice<br>
<br>
#1: Get people to stop cratering- thats basic, but obviously necessary<br>
<br>
Beyond that: One way we found to help avoid deaths was to split groups north/south and then spread out.  We had 2 decursers each side, 3 on one.   With people well spread, and people not walking into fires, grip/burst will most likely NOT kill someone.  Your decursers MUST learn to chase the guy when necessary along with a healer.   I guess purification pots would help, but we just got used to chasing them down instead of relying on 33%.<br>
<br>
#2: More healers is better  <br>
<br>
Take 10 if you have them, we had 10/3 shaman, the dps is so lightly required on this fight.<br>
<br>
#3:  Melee don't need a shaman.<br>
<br>
The melee group is probably the safest group the entire fight.  Rogues have so many ways to avoid dying, and druids can shift out and self-decurse or heal.  Use that tremor on healers to keep them in one piece and so they can heal other people.<br>
<br>
Just my 2 cents.  <br>
<br>
Also, don't get your tank airbursted.  While its still possible to win(we did), its a lot easier when im not hitting tears and berserker rage at the same time.   So tell people not to run thru ur tank at any time unless they are going to die.</div>

The melee group is probably the safest group the entire fight.  Rogues have so many ways to avoid dying, and druids can shift out and self-decurse or heal.  Use that tremor on healers to keep them in one piece and so they can heal other people.</div>

</div>If melee doesn't have a tremor do they back out? Rogues have cloak, but it won't always be up. Wouldn't a feral druid constantly have doom fire on themselves without tremor or not be able to dps when the fear cooldown was up?</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">One of our holy priests definitely was able to resist the fear with resist, and he did have a talent i believe.  No other healers were able to get a resist so we stopped trying resist.   Our shadow priests resisted some fears and were dispelling them.  That helped a decent bit at avoiding doomfire.</div>

</div>The talent obviously works against fear, but the question was concerning SR. I've yet to see evidence of SR working against fear or increasing resist% for those with a talent.<br>

Feral Druids should have a 30% resist chance.</div>

</div>We finally killed him last night and I doubt we'll be coming back until either Illidan is dead or the patch hits.  We don't have enough shaman in our guild to reliably stack, we don't have fear ward, and even with those the repeatability of the kill is contingent upon 25 people playing near-perfectly for 9 minutes.  Eventually it will happen, but humans make mistakes and this encounter has a very small allowance for them so mathematically your chances of beating it are quite low.<br>
<br>
Having to stack a class, relying on gimmicks (level 60 Purification Potions, Fear Ward), latency spikes impacting the use of tears, the list goes on.  The mechanics are interesting but the implementation makes the fight feel like banging your head against a wall.  The soul charge mechanic is also very demoralizing since it's easy to point the finger when someone makes a mistake.</div>

		<div id="post_message_443003">We only ran 3-4 melee, they just ran out if the doomfire was getting close.  They didn't get a shaman and the melee group was probably the only group where almost no one died the entire nights worth of work.  Rogues can cloak a doomfire every minute and pvp trinket out of fear every 2, plus will of the forsaken, so, basically an undead rogue that dies is a retard unless your tank messed up.<br>
<br>
I should note we had ppl throw on hp sets for this for the most part, since dps is fairly irrelevant.<br>
<br>
Our one priest was resisting a significant portion of the fears, probably about 2/3rds consistently with 240ish resist.   I can't be certain of how the fear works, but its certain that without a resist talent resist gear does not help you.<br>
<br>
<br>
I would agree with many of you that the fight is somewhat random, but, I don't agree with the assessment that this takes 100 tries to get right every time.   This fight is about 25 people knowing what can go wrong and how to correct for it.  We didn't use a single purification potion, we had 3 shaman but I wouldn't call that stacking, and 5 decursers not counting feral.   I'm not saying I expect a 1 shot, but I think probably 90% of the things that can go wrong are probably more player error than unavoidable.  If you have fear ward, that makes the fight much easier, but we only wiped once because I missed fear(it just happened to be at 25%) in 3 days, so, I wouldn't worry too much about that.  We also never really had aggro issues, despite the 1 minute fear holds, because people are focusing most of their time on evading doomfire.<br>
<br>
To give you an idea about how we approached this, some of the mages barely out damaged me(MT) on the fight because we had them decursing so much.   You get 10 minutes to kill him, he doesn't have a lot of hp, so you might as well take advantage of that and focus on survival at all costs.  If your pvp trinket is down, then just run away from the doomfires and hold up on damage.<br>
<br>
I'm sure many of you are already doing that, but I just want to emphasize those things for those still working on him.  This fight is not impossible at all.  Just keep hammering at him.</div>

		<div id="post_message_443009">My guild's first kill was without (forced) flasks and without raid stacking (only 3 shamans, no purification pots, horde). We did have a death near the end, at about 25%, which really hurt us. Something like 6 people were left alive at the end.<br>
<br>
I really believe having a right strategy for positioning makes all the difference. We were having big problems before, but changing some aspects in the strat got us the kill. 9 healers instead of our usual 8 before too. 6 decursers even. But I hardly consider that stacking. 3 resto druids really is the last thing I'd want on a boss...<br>
<br>
Trohck, I wouldn't consider a kill if you feel so bad that you won't go back till the patch. If it was that messy you must have gotten lucky. Or maybe my guild is lucky (which we never are). There may be some inherent flaw in skill or strategy.</div>

		<div id="post_message_443090">Trohck, I wouldn't consider 4 of a given class "stacking" when that class has 3 raid-viable roles and is strong in all of them. 4 Priests is pretty common in raids these days with only 2 raid-viable roles.  Especially as Horde, I don't think you can credibly fault a difficult encounter for rewarding extra Shamans in the raid.  Archimonde is a difficult and unforgiving encounter that really demands good play from everyone in the raid.  Seeing as his loot table is good and he's the final boss of a T6 instance, I don't think there's any compelling reason to make him much more forgiving.  The 2.2 changes will  reduce the luck component, and that's fine.  The skill/execution should remain the same, they're not overwhelming now.</div>

</div>From my understanding, from reading this<br>
<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304050320/http://www.wowwiki.com/Formulas:Magical_resistance" target="_blank">Formulas:Magical resistance - WoWWiki, the Warcraft wiki</a> <br>
<br>
and from experience in raids (ie MT on Ragnaros resisting knockback more with max fire resist) is that you can reach a 75% chance to resist a spell from a lvl 73 mob if you hit the resistance cap of 365 according to this formula from the above link:<br>
<br>
Average Resistance = (Target's Resistance / (Caster's Level * 5)) * 0.75<br>
<br>
Furthermore, there are two checks done on the target when the spell is cast. One is the above magical resistance check and the other is a check to see if the the spell missed. Another thing to note is the last section titled "Miss vs. resist in combat text" in the wiki as it confirms that there is some ambiguity in how combat text is shown to a player that doesn't allow you to tell if you resisted the fear bc of a miss or because of resistance.<br>
<br>
What I'm not very sure about is how our talent Unbreakable Will (15% chance to resist stun, fear, and silence) works. I don't know if it works independently or in conjunction with these two checks. My guess would be that it is factored into the chance to miss check. I'm sure this has been discussed before but I just recently began reading these forums and couldn't find anything after doing some searching.</div>

		<div id="post_message_443115">You've got it mostly right, but not quite. Spells are either binary or non-binary. <br>
<br>
<b>Binary spells</b>: not resisted or fully resisted. ex: counterspell (ie: you can't 'half resist' counterspell)<br>
<b>Non-binary spells</b>: not resisted or partially resisted. ex: fireball (ie: you hit for 100%, 75%, 50% or 25%. In theory you can reach 0% damage, but it seems in practice it cannot happen).<br>
<br>
In short, since fear cannot be partially resisted, it is a binary spell. This means, both the 'miss' roll and the 'resist' roll are done at the same time, under a single roll. I am unsure about how miss rolls function in a monsters-vs-player context, but I will assume it caps at 1% on a 73 boss. (ie: 1% chance to miss). If you wear 365 SR, it should grant you 75% chance to fully resist the spell given the binary nature of the fear. However, I am unsure whether it is possible to get 76% resistance (75% + 1%) or if there is an extra cap specifically for binary spells. <br>
<br>
But then again, the information about resists is rather scarce, even if you read all of wowwiki.</div>

</div>It's pretty hard to seperate luck from skill on this fight.  Was it a lucky kill?  We'd only ever gotten him below 50% 3 or 4 times before our kill.  And yet we survived 4 Soul Charges on the kill, 2 of them being silences with one of the dot charges occuring 50 seconds into the fight, and still ended up with 20 people alive at the end.<br>
<br>
The loot was great(sword and bow), but I share Trohck's distaste for the fight and hope we don't waste too much time trying to get repeat kills in the future.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>The improvement was gradual and over our 89 attempts.  We had several below-50% attempts, but in the end, 20% is the same fight as 90%.  When you take twenty-five people and ask them to do something difficult for 9 minutes, the odds are quite high that one will make a mistake during that time.<br>
<br>
There are two sources of luck involved.  The first is the occurrence of mistakes over a window of time.  Given that our players will make mistakes at a certain (gradually improving) rate, you can probably chart our odds.  We rolled the dice on people playing like pros for 9 consecutive minutes and we won.  Certainly these players had all individually played perfectly for 5 minutes straight during various attempts, but in the end we need 25*9 = 225 minutes of combined (and consecutive) excellent play.<br>
<br>
The second source is Archimonde's RNG choice of creating additional difficulty or penalizing us for mistakes.<br>
- A hunter gets unnecessarily doomfired.  That might be okay, or she might get air-burst and cursed 1 second before a fear.<br>
- A druid steps into a doomfire because other healers were pushed away and the MT was dipping.  That might be okay, or he might be feared into another doomfire and then air-bursted.<br>
- Someone dies and we get silenced.  The tank might dodge 3 attacks, or she might take 21,000 damage.<br>
- A warlock gets airbursted.  His internet might cough and increase latency by 750ms, or it might not.<br>
<br>
We improved our awareness and our ability to react to nasty combinations.  As you improve at a given encounter, you're increasing your odds of a perfect attempt, but luck is most certainly still involved.  The randomness of Archimonde's abilities compared to other bosses cannot be denied.  Many bosses have random abilities, but few have 4 pseudorandom abilities (5 if you count the use of soul charge) that can converge in the way Archimonde's can.<br>
<br>
Different guilds are going to struggle with different encounters as raiders have personal strengths and weaknesses, but I can't think of an encounter that taxed situational awareness more so than Archimonde.  From my perspective as a hunter playing the encounter, the excitement of the challenge quickly turned to boredom and frustration; I felt like I was taking free throws and waiting to make 10 in a row.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_443186"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->A rule of thumb that I use in my head is "if you get silenced, you wiped."  Depending on what else happens during that time, you might pull through just fine.  But if the silencing Soul Charge goes off, you're pretty much at the mercy of the RNG.  Our one wipe last night actually came on a double silence, since the guy who died had Spirit of Redemption...the first silence was survivable.  Still, you can't really get through 4 Soul Charges and bag a "fluke" Archimonde kill.  If you killed him under those conditions you can kill him under any conditions.<br>
<br>
P.S. Trohck, how can you label the occurrence of individual mistakes as luck?  That makes no sense.  Yes, you can have a nearly-perfect run ruined at 20% by a stupid mistake and then wipe at 90% the next run to a bunch of stupid mistakes, but there's still a mistake.  It might feel like you're just spinning the slots to get everything to line up, but at the individual level there's very little random chance.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>You're right that luck is not an accurate term for the occurrence of individual mistakes.  All encounters require a level of skill and execution that if you don't pass, you wipe.  In Archimonde's case, individual mistakes by any member of the raid are incredibly meaningful.<br>
<br>
While it belies a lack of skill that mistakes are made, in my experience the mistakes are relatively spread throughout our raiders, meaning I will go 30 attempts without making a mistake and then I will make one, wiping us.  What I feel like is that I have a certain amount of skill, so for example I will make a mistake 1 out of 30 times.  A less skilled person might do it 1 in 20, and a greater skilled 1 in 100.  What I'm referring to as "luck" is the fact that these mistakes are very isolated from one another.  What are the odds of: 25 people, 0 mistakes, 9 minutes given our skill matrix?  While this is the same concept as any encounter, the length of the encounter and the meaning of the mistakes are what set it apart.  No other encounter makes every single person simultaneously accountable and penalizes you as severely when anyone messes up.  So it ends up feeling like a dice roll.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">A rule of thumb that I use in my head is "if you get silenced, you wiped."  Depending on what else happens during that time, you might pull through just fine.  But if the silencing Soul Charge goes off, you're pretty much at the mercy of the RNG.  Our one wipe last night actually came on a double silence, since the guy who died had Spirit of Redemption...the first silence was survivable.  Still, you can't really get through 4 Soul Charges and bag a "fluke" Archimonde kill.  If you killed him under those conditions you can kill him under any conditions.</div>

</div>I actually disagree with both Eir and Trohck and think our Archimonde kill will end up being much more repeatable than they do. I think we turned a bit of a corner when we stopped worrying quite so much on being perfect and focused a little more on being able to recover when someone inevitably made a mistake.   Having the server pick that night to decide to throw random server latency in the mix just made things that much more interesting as several people crashed and burned from tear lag.<br>
<br>
Just a comment about your quote, one of our 4 soul charges was a priest with Improved Death who clicked off the buff as soon as he died.  We were only actually were hit with one soul charge from him.  It kind of seemed to me that Archimonde has a short internal cooldown on Soul charge.  We've also had 2 people die at virtually the same moment and it seemed like we only got one of those soul charges as well.  Am I just crazy or have other people noticed this as well?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>We feel the same. Infact the Mage who made our kill video hated the fight so much that he made an hilarious intro to it. You can watch it <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080316050618/http://stage6.divx.com/user/wasabimilkshake/video/1498800/Blue-Garter-vs-Archimonde" target="_blank">here</a> if you feel so inclined. It pretty much sums itself up.<br>
<br>
Aside from the myriad of other things wrong with this fight, for me, the absolute worst factor is his Fear's recast time. I don't even mind breaking a 1 second fear from a different continant but occasionally having to go nearly 2 minutes of doing nothing but Shield Block and Heroic Strike is horrible and artificially lengthens the fight.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_444828"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Last logout we were a whole day on archimonde and didn't get him down - 22 tries all together. While there were some wipes due to players faults, the majority of them came from some fear combination. And there are alot of them. Fear + burstdamage, Fear &gt; double fire (2 fires on the same spot, ticks for 2x2400/s), fear &gt; fire + grib, fear &gt; fire/grip &gt; airburst. There are a lot of combinations. A lot of times you can avoid dying from that, but it required only one out of 25 to die from it in a ~8-9min fight to wipe the raid (most of the times it does). And we're a horde guild - so no fearward.<br>
<br>
Before the patched the fire it was ok somehow, since it was so slow. Now it goes in all nasty ways like starting behind the tank, doing a 180° turn and going right through him and the melee camp.<br>
<br>
I can't wait for some of the other stuff, like someone falling through the world. Never happend to us - yet.<br>

One person died from grip immediately after getting air burst at about 70%.<br>

I think the key (other than stacking shaman) is the emphasis that everyone must, pot/hs/bandage whenever possible to ease the load on the healers and dispellers and keep themselves topped up incase of a airburst/grip combo.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I would have hoped that they could come up with something more original that:<br>
<br>
a) Didn't involve such a large degree of luck<br>
b) Fearward/1s stance dancing<br>
<br>
Even with a more reliable timer in 2.3 so that people can accurately gauge the stance dancing, it's still not a fun mechanic. Sure, there are ways to minimize its impact (stacking any class is dumb, btw) but I maintain that they can do better.

If people use it intelligently (use it only if you are a moment away from running headlong into fire, or if you need to heal/decurse someone who likely will die if you don't), it really minimizes all of these issues on a raidwide level without needing shaman stacking -- though again, you really do want 2-3 shamans... if you do the fight with 1, you can't complain I don't think.

		<div id="post_message_445172"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Oh, I made it a point to ensure that everyone had a 2 minute trinket going into the fight.  I've read all your posts, and I agree that people can learn to minimize risks. Still, why is fear in the game? I can picture the designer thinking "Hmm, this needs an extra element of randomness because I'm not sure it will be quite challenging enough as it stands. Bleh, we'll just throw in fear. Yeah, yeah, I know it's tired, but we're on crunch and we need to get this out the door."<br>
<br>
For example, they could have thrown in the Infinite dragonflight, which never manifests itself in the whole instance. Not once. There is no indication that the flight has anything to do with the zone other than the fact that it's in Caverns of Time.  Instead of fear, you could deal with drakes or dragonkin or anything at all that necessitates an extra layer of control. Kael'thas proved (in my view anyway) that control fights make for the best encounters.

I was wondering if anyone at BlizzCon would ask Metzen or Kaplan about the Infinite Dragonflight's absence in Hyjal.  I would've myself, but didn't feel like elbowing my way past two dozen ret paladins lining up for every Q&amp;A.<br>
<br>
At the end of the day, though, while I appreciate the objective criticisms, I do enjoy the zone when we do it every week, just as much as I enjoy BT.  The first four bosses are 100% predictable and unless you have some catastrophe, you should one-shot them every time, every week, once you've learned them.  That means it's a 2hr clear to Archimonde with really nice loot along the way.  Archimonde has no trash but is more "random" and obviously has a different feel to it than the other fights in the zone, but he's also an Illidan-tier boss in theory.  This is entirely subjective, I realize, but I have fun throughout Hyjal, unlike Shahraz or pre-2.1 SSC/TK trash.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>30s cooldown, and the fear itself is 8s.  So without stacking shaman, some of your DPS is going to have 22s maximum time where they don't need to "stay far far away".<br>
<br>
And staying far away enough to be safe is nearly impossible.  The fear doesn't have any direction changing limitations or max distance.

The time when DPS isn't in danger of being feared into a doomfire or running from doomfire is very, very minimal.  If you really want to be safe, you need to be 8s' worth of run speed away from any doomfire when the fear cooldown is up.  This is in addition to dodging doomfires normally.  I would be surprised if you spent more than 10s out of 30 DPS'ing and not running from doomfires with this approach.<br>

It's mitigatable by stacking shamans of course, or having dispellers break their fears with cooldowns and put themselves at risk instead of you.   Both are poor solutions to a poor mechanic.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>That should be really, really rare.  Yeah, sometimes you take that beeline sprint towards the (originally) distant doomfire, but that's what your PVP trinket is for.  Having that happen twice in two minutes should be vanishingly rare.<br>
<br>
And really, if you only spend 20% of your time dpsing but stay alive, then fine -- if you start wiping to enrage then you can address it.  But I doubt that'll happen. :-)<br>
<br>
For reference, I probably get doomfired one out every ten or so pulls, and usually that's because I was looking out for someone else and used my (5-minute, 'cause I suck) PvP trinket to decurse or NS+HT.  I'm usually fairly in the middle of the action; close enough to be decursing folks and keeping all the HoTs I can up on the MT.  That's not to say that I'm ultra-pro at this fight, but if you really focus on safety, you can definitely avoid enough doomfires to comfortably get a kill.<br>
<br>
And, for what it's worth, even with the frustrations, Archimonde is my favorite fight in TBC.  It can suck to wipe over and over, but the second-to-second gameplay (at least for a druid) just can't be beat.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>In my experience, it is rare.  But if you combine it with getting feared into doomfires that spawn just before or during the fear or doomfires that spread towards you during a fear, 2 minutes is not enough without simply dropping your DPS to 0.  You end up having to take risks.<br>
<br>
You'll eventually get doomfired - if it's happening to you 1 in 10 attempts it is happening to your raid 2.5 times per attempt.  Healers could handle that sometimes, except you can also get gripped and/or airbursted in the same second that the doomfire applies.  That's what makes the fight excruciating.<br>
<br>
Druids in our guild also seem to enjoy it more than most, probably because their role is different than "run around hoping not to be killed by the RNG".<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Yes, most of the time your DPS is going to be moving and not DPSing. What's your point? If your DPS spends 1/3rd of their time doing nothing in order to insure they don't take more than minimal damage, you're still going to kill him. If your DPS is going all out on Archimonde and rushing to kill Archimonde  as quickly as possible, and hence taking extra damage, a wipe is much more likely.<br>
<br>
Obviously sometimes you can do everything right and get feared right into a Doomfire (without a shaman ~_~ I don't give myself one for this fight and it looks so much easier for the people who get a tremor), in which case you just heal through it. After all, one or two Doomfires aren't going to kill anyone. However, the majority of the time, it is definitely the player's fault, and when like 5 people in the raid are Doomfired at any given time, you're probably doing something wrong.<br>
<br>
This is probably why you're having so much trouble with the fight. You can do next to nothing for 10 minutes and still kill Archimonde as long as no one dies.<br>
<br>
There's really no justifiable reason for you to call the mechanic 'poor.' It's obviously a very defeatable encounter. Is it hard? Definitely. Is it broken or anything? Not really, except for the fact that the cooldown on the fear is actually 27 seconds from the start of the last fear's cast, so 26 seconds, and if it comes as soon as it's off cooldown, he's going to run off and kill someone. That's pretty cool. (We sometimes have a fear ward, but it always goes to a healer when we have it. It's stupid to give fear ward to a member of the raid who is already perfectly capable of breaking his own fears.)<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>How many healers and decursers are you bringing?  A typical Archimonde for us sees us with 9 healers.  It surely doesn't take 9 healers to keep up the MT and Doomfire isn't THAT bad to heal for a few people.  Decurses should be happening close to instantly so there shouldn't be much damage being taken from Grip.  <br>
<br>
Our kill this week wasn't exactly flawless, as we had a shaman die, ankh, and die immediately -- so we had to deal with 2 Soul Charges to boot, but to give you an idea -- we had 15 people hit by Doomfire, which was fairly similiar to last weeks kill.  The point being, people are going to take Doomfire damage, that's inevitable, so it sounds like to me that you need to distribute your healers better.  <br>
<br>
This is very much a positionial awareness fight, both as an individual, a group, and a raid.  I'll be honest, the first time we killed him, and even the second, I thought to myself "I can't ever see this be repeatable in a reasonable time span."  I was wrong, it's just it requires almost everyone to maintain total focus for the entire fight.  When you wipe, you really have to drill down and figure out what the cause was.  Was it because of no decurse?  Where were the decursers?   Did they die due to no heals?  Where were all the healers?  Did you have healers assigned to that area/quadrant?  Where were they?  If they weren't there, why weren't they?  And so on.<br>
<br>
You very much want to stay a healthy distance away from Doomfires when the fear cooldown is up, but it's even more important to know what to do if you get hit by it.  For me, that's healthstone + shield, with a finger ready to hit a health pot too if there aren't any heals incoming by then.  If your healers aren't using Grid or if they are and don't have the Doomfire debuff set to display -- that's a small problem right there.  Same thing for Grip of the Legion.<br>
<br>
I know I'm distinctly in the minority but I love the complete concentration it takes from your raid.  There's really no time where you can take a deep breath and relax like Illidan for example, or pretty much any other fight.  You always have to have a plan already in place for what you're going to do should something happen to you.  What if Archimonde were to cast a Doomfire right in front of you, are you concentrating enough to immediately turn around and run directly away from him?  When I get Air Bursted for example, I'm completely ready to shield + healthstone + pot -- I'm assuming I'm going to get Gripped as I'm flying through the air.  Everyone needs to have that mentality.   Then you don't have to stress over 2.5 people getting Doomfire each attempt because that's just not realistic.  There's going to be damage thrown around, and your healers will have to deal with it and you'll have to help them a little bit sometimes.<br>
<br>
Every week we go back, it's interesting.. because you can just see on the first pull we still don't quite make the paradigm shift in thinking of survival first.  Damage goes way up as a result and we wipe.  Then we remember "Oh, hey, maybe we should worry about DPS second, and staying alive first" and it goes a lot more smoothly.   That paradigm shift is what I think makes Archimonde a unique boss fight.   It's just the designer saying "Hey, we're going to throw some random shit at you, and if you're smart/good enough to avoid most of it, you'll win because we made the DPS requirement extremely easy."<br>
<br>
Obviously this doesn't address issues such as being feared through the world, or the wonderful Spirit of Redemption you lose feature, but I'm addressing things that are controllable.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I think the combinatorial nature of his abilities is a very poor mechanic.  Not only do many people on this thread agree, Blizzard also does as evidenced by their changes to the encounter in 2.2.  The long fear is also a poor mechanic because it greatly rewards class stacking.<br>
<br>
But ultimately, my justification for calling the mechanic poor is that the fight is not fun for me.  Is it because myself or my raid group just don't have the skill to handle it consistently?  That is your suggestion, but the end result is the same.<br>
<br>
Re: Siawyn.  Thanks for the helpful suggestions.  Fielding 9 healers is difficult for us since most fights require 6-7.  We do it when we can, and yes they're all using Grid with Doomfire and curse enabled, etc.  The problem is pretty clear to me: We need 25 people to make no mistakes for 9 minutes that the RNG chooses to favor us.  Empirically speaking, this happens 1 out of 89 tries.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>We rarely have more than 7 healers online, and only 1 resto shaman in the guild. Trying to recruit a competent resto shaman as Alliance is like hunting snipe. <br>
<br>
Also, I wouldn't be so quick to claim it's an organizational problem if a guild can't field X of Y class, or even X of Z archetype. Kaplan admitted as much during the Blizzcon panels that they try to be extremely conscious of class balance when designing encounters. It seems to me that the difference in difficulty between having 7 healers and 9 healers on some of these fights is far greater than it ought to be, at least from reading other people's posts. <br>
<br>
Honestly, I wouldn't know if it does get much easier, so I'm just basing it on what you guys are saying. We've never had more than 8 healers in a TBC raid and typically run with 6-7 because that's all we can field.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Then that sounds like a horrific design for a fight.  <br>
<br>
Any fight where the DPS can sit around for 10 minutes not really doing DPS is poorly designed.<br>
<br>
<br>
There are several arguments floating all through this thread:<br>
<br>
1.) Is it too hard?  - Many people who have beaten the fight have argued that the fight is over the top.  Obviously Blizzard thought it was too hard and the nerf is incoming.<br>
<br>
2.) Is it fun?  - Some people certainly enjoy it.  But this is the second most detested fight in all of tier 6 content right now.  In the end it's a matter of personal opinion.<br>
<br>
3.) Is it well designed?  - 8 second fears?  Ranged DPS not contributing much beyond "don't fuck up"?  I understand people who think it's fun, or not that hard, but I have a problem accepting that it's a well designed fight.  8 second fear on a 30 second cooldown.  I mean, come on!<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Is the fight fun? Probably not for those who do not enjoy spamming decurse. DoT classes do well, Rogues and other Melee classes dominate, so Hunters and meter whore Mages are probably a bit frustrated.<br>

</div>You may be right about the ideal way to design raid encounters, but at a certain point I think tuning gets hampered by that idea.  It would be very difficult to properly test and tune an encounter with the expectation that it be of roughly equal difficulty regardless of class composition, or even something broader like role composition (healers/tanks/dps).  Furthermore, I think there's a transition that many guilds go through at a certain point in TBC progression.<br>
<br>
Basically, in Tier 4/5 content you're rewarded for your DPS.  This continues through some of Tier 6.  At the end of Tier 6 though, there's a big (and probably too-sudden) change.  Instead of healers being limited by mana (highly negotiable), they are limited by time.  Raid damage is suddenly so heavy, bursty and unpredictable that you just can't handle it with too few healers.  Having attempted Illidari Council with 7 versus 8 healers (while learning), it's night and day.  For Shahraz, Archimonde, Illidari Council and Illidan there's just a certain critical mass of healers that can really keep things stable no matter what.  Less than that is doable but 6-7 healers just isn't something I'd recommend for some of these fights while you're learning them.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Sure, most fights is possible with 8 healers, but many are easier with 9. I find it hard to believe that many guilds have so active members that they can not afford to have a few extra people for each role rotating spots or for use in some fights.

</div>As a healer, I concur :P<br>
I do think that the transition is a little too sudden.  You can rock Gurtogg/Reliquary/Azgalor with 6-7 healers, but every fight from there on out really rewards bringing more (8-ish).  I think we'll see a lot of guilds recruiting healers when they reach this plateau, much the way most guilds had to open Warrior recruitment for the Four Horsemen (though the Horsemen required legitimate raid-stacking, unlike the T6 content).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
6 on Teron is also a recipe for trouble if you get all your Shadows on healers.<br>
<br>
6 is also kinda rough on Naj'entus.  6 is probably good for Supremus, Akama, and RoS though; and of course 6 is fine or even optimal for almost all t5 content if you have a couple of spriests to support your healers.<br>
<br>
Honestly, fights are generally less healing-intensive than they used to be.  If you think about it, I'd say 15 healers (30%) was pretty standard for 40-man raids, and people would stack 16-17 for something like Patchwerk or even 18-19 for Sapphiron when learning the fight.  30% of a 25-man raid is 7.5 healers, and I don't think there's a fight in the game that can't be done with 8.  Just like you wouldn't really do Sapphiron or Patchwerk with 13 healers (at least not until you were overgeared in mostly t3 loot) I don't think it's unreasonable that bringing 6-7 healers to Shahraz or Archimonde is a disadvantage.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_447260"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Your math is a little off.  30% of 40 is 12.  <br>
<br>
If you simply go 16 healers, and take 16*25/40 you get 10 healers.<br>
<br>
I initially thought we would be using 11 healers in TBC raids before we ever did Gruul.  We used 11 or 12 on Maulgar and it worked really well.  I assumed it would scale.  With the extra healing class this would make sense, especially as 4/9ths of the raid classes are healers.  <br>
<br>
The 40 man equivalence of 6 healers is 9.6 healers, which is absolutely ridiculous to think about.  7 is 11.2, 8 is 12.8, 9 is 14.4, 10 is 16, 11 is 17.6.  <br>
<br>
I didn't make this post however to nitpick yours Praetorian.<br>
<br>
I just was posting that the nerfs/hotfixes are live on archimonde.<br>
We'll be trying him sunday or monday of this week - and let people know how it goes.  I'd be curious also with any reports of people who have tried him with the changes in place.  I believe these changes truly remove the "you lose" categories - by removing collusive abilities, and perhaps stopping the silence from being a wipe 75% of the time.<br>

I know it is a lot (lot) easier to post how this fight is doable and "our awesome guild" killed it in just "X amount" of tries.  But the sheer number of messages I've received in private on this fight and the frustrating mechanics of it is probably larger than this thread by itself.  I think these changes will be mostly welcome by most raiders for repeatability, and certainly for new guilds trying him out and not becoming frustrated.  It is still a little sad the types of mechanics that are used to make this boss seem "hard" - but hotfixing to stop utilizing level 40 potions to overcome retarded circumstances has been happening since Gruul 1.0.  I'm not sure why people think popping purification potions in mid air is "strategy" or a good idea.<br>
<br>
And a bit more on topic - this fight is clearly easier with more healers, and more shamans.  In fact each shaman makes this fight significantly easier (intensely so).  But this has all been said already.  We plan to box or have 5 shamans on for archimonde kills - even if it is a 1 shot, it is only as such due to this stacking and planning.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<font color="blue">In an effort to apply some of our upcoming 2.2 changes in a more expedited manner, we're hotfixing some elements of the Archimonde encounter. Not every planned change to Archimonde could be hotfixed, the other announced changes will occur with the release of patch 2.2.<br>
<br>
The following hotfix changes are now live:<br>
<br>
    * Archimonde now casts fear in a bit more consistent manner, roughly every 40 seconds.<br>
    * Fear's cast time is now 1.5 seconds.<br>
    * Grip of the Legion now has only a 60 yard range.<br>
    * Red Soul Charge now only silences players for 4 seconds.<br>
<br>
<br>
The planned changes for Mother Shahraz could not be hotfixed, but we are working to resolve via hotfix the timing issue with Essence of Desire's Rune Shield and Spirit Shock. Working on that fix, we discovered that Rune Shield wasn't actually absorbing any damage. We're also working to fix that error. Since the Rune Shield is normally removed quickly, Essence of Desire still won't get much benefit out of the effect. Mages who Spell Steal the effect will be quite a bit happier, however.</font>

		<div id="post_message_447424">Well the encounter has the epic feeling that... its BIG... even without much there in terms of doodads and such, the sheer size of the 'playground' seems to work well as a good setting.<br>
<br>
Its just a shame that the boss really only has 2 abilities of significance, Doomfire and AoE fear.<br>
As said before however the fact he only has one phase... as with all bosses with it generally... its very dull and unimpressive.<br>
<br>
Take Finger of Death for example, its a key ability that he has, it could be used in some really significant way which requires half the raid to focus on something to adapt to it. It could be really 'epic' and make people build up, endure it, then 'phew' we survived it, and instead its just a 'clean up' ability to make wiping go faster.</div>

		<div id="post_message_447463">For a zone's end boss, Archimonde is a horribly designed fight.<br>
<br>
I don't mean that in perspective of difficulty or luck. I mean that for every end boss for a raiding Zone (heck even magtheridon), there are two or more phases involved. For a boss that has zero trash clearing and as a lore-rich end boss of current end game zone, Archimonde is almost stupidly simply designed, and involves pretty much just one phase (if you include the lolwisp phase i guess its two)<br>
<br>
I hope for a redesign, but with Sunwell (rumor) hitting in like 2-3 months, I guess i don't really care that much anymore</div>

</div>Vashj has been nerfed to oblivion but the design in itself is way more interesting than archimonde's one in my opinion. There are multiple phases, adds, something unique to the fight (tainted core), all in all it's a "real" end boss which I will remember. Off course, it's way too easy since 2.1 patch, especially compared to how kael is vs other tk bosses but well, I still enjoyed killing her the first few times.<br>
On the other hand, you have seen everything about archimonde after 3 pulls, there's little if any sense of progress. I enjoyed discovering the different vashj/kael/illidan phases, I took screenshots when I first saw demon illidan, striders, kael's weapons... I took 0 screenshots of archimonde. I was indeed satisfied to kill him, especially since we killed him in the top 20 world but well, 5 mins later I was like "ok, we avoided some fears and fires, we got epics, that's cool" and I went to bed. Guild chat was much more filled with satisfaction feelings when we killed Kael, Illi or even C'thun or nef. I can explain the archimonde strat in 3 lines (even 1 : don't die.). I can write 3 pages about illidan or kael's strategy.<br>
Ah well, what's done is done, and it's still a fun fight, but like I said, it's below the requirements of a "cool end boss" for me. Can't wait for arthas =)</div>

Having been on the receiving end of "GG" combinations, I don't recall a single instance where I simply could not have survived.

</div>I completely agree with this, there is a place in WoW for pure skill checks like Archimonde, like there is a place for pure gear checks (patchwerk), resist check (shahraz) ... I just think this place is not the end boss one. I'm happy that a fight like Archimonde exists in the game, but I would have expect him to be a boss in the instance, not the end boss because with 2+ years of wow raiding experience, I expect from end bosses to be very complex (in termes of strategy), multi phases encounters. Archimonde is hard, very hard, but not complex at all. This added to the fact that he really promotes raid stacking (shamans in particular) is a bit "meh". But well, like I said, that's just a personal opinion and at the end, I very much liked BC, including whole Hyjal.<br>

</div>She has? I thought the only nerfs to the encounter that took place basically took it from "Only beatable if you got lucky and/or abused some bug" to "Fun!". That is, some reduction in adds health before anyone had even seen the encounter outside of one or two guilds and the removal of that crazy Mind Control ability in phase three are the only nerfs I can think of.

		<div id="post_message_447617">Honnestly, I don't remember exactly what was changed, but my guild had some tries on vashj before 2.1 (killed leotheras in april) and phase 2 seemed much harder than it felt post 2.1. We never tried it fully flask + pot though, since we were aware of the almost impossible p3. I do think every spawn had more hp, I also remember that the tainted element took 1 min to respawn if you missed the kill instead of insta respawning like it is now, so a tainted missed was pretty much a wipe since adds dps was very hard to sustain. Obviously, 1 more month of gear farming before 2.1 helped this too.<br>
Oh and also, I heard poison in p3 used to tick on hit. Now it only ticks after a few secs, which means you can take 0 dmg by constant moving and the fight can goes on even after enrage hits, at least for 1-2 mins. Post 2.1, you took 2-3k dmg or so on hit so you died very fast after enrage.<br>
By the way, the fact that she was nerfed (too much in my opinion) doesn't mean I think situation pre 2.1 was nice. It was stupid, like almost all the raid game pre 2.1 was, and changes were welcomed. But vashj 2.1 is, in my opinion, tuned a little bit too easy. I still think nowadays that hydross or leotheras are harder than vashj, which is not normal. Or kael is tuned way too hard. As you wish.</div>

		<div id="post_message_447636">It was more than that and you know it, almost everything was retuned (nerfed) during the 2.1 patch in SSC including Vashj. Making the fight doable is a thing (and it was done by removing mind control which is already a pretty major nerf, they could have let the mc and let us being able to CC people or removing the dmg/heal buff and make tanks immune but whatever, that was a fix.), making the fight easier is another thing, and it has been done on vashj (like I said, insta tainted elemental respawn and poison not ticking on hits are the 2 things I remember, there probably were other changes).</div>

</div>Keeping hold at the alliance base was hard enough by itself - much less razing the undead base.  I think archimonde was also unkillable - he resurrected once and only took 1 point of damage at a time.

</div>I have a theory to why Archimonde is easier then 2.0 (didn't see 1.0) but because we killed him on our first attempt, I would just be talking out of my ass. But I will just present it anyways, I found that Doomfires to be less intense/frequent for the very reason that his fear is on a more consistent timer, if he is casting fear (I think) he isn't casting doomfires constantly.<br>
<br>
I don't know I need to see it more, but something was different other than the hotfixes, a by-product of them for that matter.</div>

The new fear allows me as the MT to basically unload on aggro and never get "Feared" - even if before you could change stances, we've had people die from me mashing it as quick as possible on a late global hit (this was already discussed in length).  <br>
<br>
It is basically much more reasonable as a tank due to the cast time.<br>
<br>
Further, the fears are about 40-50 seconds apart, with relatively precise gaps.<br>
<br>
This is really the biggest change.  What it lets you do is essentially stand in "danger zones" a bit longer (nearly twice as long), and then move when the fear is actually imminent.  You can actually brace for the fear, and it comes less frequently.  Making the fear less significant obviously is better for the fight design, but the fight is now certainly easier.  <br>
<br>
The grip change seems good - but obviously even the upcoming? final version of grip+air burst you can be gripped before air bursted (unless it provided immunity) - but this is less common now, but has to be dealt with.  <br>
<br>
The fight is definitely much better now - but I can't help but thinking it is simply because fear is less of a factor.  The fear is perhaps what makes this fight suck.  Its hard to see how they could make the fight more difficult however without having the fear - sort of silly to rely on fear to artificially increase the difficulty of an encounter.  Yech.<br>
Because the fear is less common now, you can pvp trinket almost every other one.<br>
<br>
The fight is certainly more enjoyable now - but you've still got issues of stacking.  Also the change to the silence is good - its no longer an 80% chance of a wipe when a priest dies.<br>
<br>
It seems like they could still tune a few things here and there:<br>
You can still be feared under the world.<br>
I believe we got a soul charge from a Spirit of redemption death.<br>
Grip plus air burst still exists - and is kinda silly, should be removed.  (and these 3 things apparently will be fixed in 2.2).<br>
The fight still hugely favors stacking regardless of these changes, or how you can do it with XY and Z guild... doesn't mean its better or even smart to do it that way.  <br>
The doomfire itself can lead to a particularly nasty death where you get air bursted, land in a doomfire way behind the raid, and get feared away from your healers.  I guess this is okay now since grip can't join the fray, but it would seem better if doomfire didn't stack on you beyond 80 yards from the boss.  I would guess though, that this would be impossible to code.<br>
<br>
Is it harder than Archimonde 1.0?  Yes.  Archimonde 2.0 makes you wonder how you ever got hit by doomfires in 1.0.  Further, you could go entire kills on 1.0 without ever having a doomfire near your raid.  Both 1.0 and 2.0 sucked though because of the fear and inconsistencies with doomfire.  You could have back to back pulls that varied 10 fold in difficulty, and for that this fight is far more consistent and even now.</div>

		<div id="post_message_448146">I never would've imagined that 0.5 and 2 seconds respectively could have such an impact on the way I look at an encounter.<br>
<br>
From a non-tanking point of view, the added 0.5 second casting time to Fear gives me an instant longer to look around once Fear is being cast, letting me plan what I'll do once Fear hits and I'm sent running off in X direction. I don't know if I'm really getting myself across here, but the small difference kept me from blowing unnecessary CDs (WotF and trinket, mostly) more than once.<br>
<br>
The one time a Silence soul charge class died, we all kind of braced for impact and most of us (probably all of us) thought that it was wipe time, but the silence passed incredibly quick and we picked up for a kill.<br>
<br>
We DID wipe more than once, but with the exception of one incident which I truly believe was a GG situation (rogue with all CDs down gets Grip+Burst, runs back, is decursed and immediately recursed + Burst again, this time into a doomfire) it was all due to player error, including several people who should've known better cratering for unknown reasons.</div>

		<div id="post_message_448641">I'm going to be very curious to check this fight out again next week, as our only kill came this reset before the fixes. Tentatively I'm inclined to agree with the guy who said these are mostly a placebo; I definitely feel that way about the Grip changes. We had way more deaths to doomfires, usually in conjunction with an air burst. The few Grip deaths I recall were generally, "I didn't get decursed for 5 ticks, wtf, I'm standing right next to you" and the mages/druids saying decursive showed them as OOR, not "I got Gripped in mid air".<br>
<br>
The fear change is probably a more substantive change to the difficulty of the fight, although I can only think of a few times we wiped because of a missed fear break. More consistency will definitely help ranged dps, both in not taking doomfires and in actually doing damage.</div>

</div>Haven't seen the encounter this week (we killed him before they hotfixed so assuming the fear is 40 seconds in between), but the code above changes the warning after fear to say "Next fear in 40sec". The other code changes the bar to display 40 seconds instead of 30,  and the warning "Fear soon" @ 35 seconds. Make sure you don't edit the code after that. Starts with elseif and has ArchBurst in the same line. As a side note, I've never been good at coding, so I take no responsibility if the code above is wrong, but all that was changed were the timers by 10 seconds.</div>

</div>We had a ton of issues with him on Tuesday night. I think it's because people keep reading that he's been nerfed, and that he is so much easier now, and so (somewhat the opposite of what happened with LiteSaber) proceeded to not pay enough attention or take the fight seriously enough. Certainly didn't help that we brought a few people who had never seen the fight before either.</div>

		<div id="post_message_452030">The changes definitely make it easier for the tank.  Our MT was laughing at how easy it was to stance switch for fear.  Telling the raid that "fear is coming in 5 seconds" is amazing for shaman who can time their tremor totems to pulse 1-2 seconds into the fear.<br>
<br>
For kicks, I looked back at how many attempts Archimonde has taken us.  <br>
<br>
1.0: 12 wipe learning night, 18th attempt kill<br>
2.0: 8 attempts<br>
2.0: 5 attempts<br>
2.0: 6 attempts<br>
2.0: 1 attempt<br>
2.0: 4 attempts<br>
2.1: 1.5 attempt -- Tank dying in 2 seconds only counts as 1/2 an attempt =)<br>
<br>
All kills except the first used 4 shaman.  The fight can easily go wrong, but you should hopefully expect your guild to get better at it over time.</div>

		<div id="post_message_452068">The key for us the last few kills has been warning people when a fear is coming so they can move away from Doomfires in the area. If someone says they died to Doomfire they obviously did not do their job, which is to live.<br>
<br>
Seems that the new Archimonde is also a lot less painful when people die, though it might just be people adapting to the fight after many many painful attempts.<br>
<br>
We did find more Shaman beneficial, but they are not required. The last few kills has been with 2 in the raid. I feel that the only need to bring Shaman now is for the healer group's Tremor Totem. Any more just helps out of groups who cannot help but play in the fire.</div>

We beat patchwerk in less attempts than grobbulus by far - because people were mentally not focused and assuming that shit would be easier than it turned out.

It's easy to see that the trick was getting it into peoples heads that keeping yourself alive is your #1 priority above all else.

<br>
As a member of one of our non-shaman groups, it's night and day with fear-&gt;doomfire awareness. Even for shaman groups, the DPS improvement offered by the fear change is nearly doubled. Being that we had previously been hyper-sensitive to never having the chance to be doomfired and then seeing a berserk timer, I can't fathom us being in that position again, unless we survive 8+ DPS soul charges.</div>

</div><br>
The problem with spreading out 360 degrees is that it becomes nigh impossible for healers and decursers to cross heal and that made the kill for us. There are still many random things in the fight that can make it go awry, which can eventually lead to healing and decursing being unable to hit their group for a significant period of time. <br>
<br>
Unless you stack 10 healers, that positioning only seems to make the fight harder since we tried such a setup and ended up getting peaced out when a healer got launched away from their group as it scrambled to dodge doomfire. It wasn't until we began attempting it with a 180* plan that we started seeing progress.<br>
<br>
The fear change was great in one aspect, since that made the boss a little less impossible to tank, however that still leaves us at the mercy of grip-burst combos and rampant doomfires that  have more mood swings than a beaten Latina. One attempt, it's perfectly distributed, another it's okay, and then the next you have all three making a unified ring of death around the MT.<br>

Can't wait for 2.2.</div>

</div>I think the most important point of our strat is that each group is a "unit" that is responsible for it's own survival.  The idea is that more than one or two units shouldn't be out of commission (Doomfire or Air Burst) at one time, so the MT should still have plenty of healing.  If Doomfire is ubiquitous in any one quadrant, that group slides to the side a bit and other groups compensate, but the units should always stay together with some distance between each other.  Sometimes, someone will call out to throw extra heals to so-and-so or decurse someone, so the other groups will help out, but for the most part, we're completely independant.<br>
<br>
Of course, we also run with 4 shaman almost 100% of the time, so that helped a lot when fears were unpredictable. =b<br>
<br>
It's worked very well for us, though now it's probably not completely necessary, since you can't be Gripped way far away (always getting Air Burst as a group means there's always healers and always a decurser to keep the group alive).  The predictable fears now make it even easier, too.  We usually 1- or 2-shot him every week with this strat, and have been for a while.<br>

		<div id="post_message_463386">Our guild were trying this encounter for slightly less than 2 nights, using the 3 teams positioned in triangle around him. Got to around 36% after our first 10 attempts or so on the first day and pretty much always reaching 30-50% on our second day, but still haven't killed him yet. Everyone seem to perform at their best trying to avoid deaths, but "random" unavoidable stuff always seem to wipe us (like Airburst + Grip for example). <br>
<br>
The thing that i'm wondering the most is how does your raid DPS meter look like on the actual kill? <br>
We seem to have a huge problem with ranged dps classes being extremely low, unlike all other encounters. We fit in the 10 minute enrage timer perfectly, but the dmg difference between the melee and casters/ranged is insane. We got him to 34% on our last attempt yesterday and the meters looked something like : Whole melee group (2 warriors, 1 rogue, 1enh shaman, 1 feral druid) had around 10-13% raid dps each. The average dps for the melee group is around 1 - 1.3k each. The 6th on meters was a shadow priest with only 4.5%, the rest were even lower, some lower than MT. (noone died till ~36-37%).<br>
We've gotten Doomfire on melee group only 3 times in 2 days (20-25 attempts each), so i'm wondering if it would be better to bring in another full melee dps group (assuming they spread in 2 camps around archimonde's mob square)?  How would it effect the amount of Doomfire and Airburst on melee? <br>
<br>
I'm pretty sure some guilds tried it so any feedback would be appreciated. As well as tips on how to improve ranged dps in this encounter.</div>

</div>Maybe your ranged are clumping up too much, causing air burst to decrease damage too much? What seemed to work for us was to tell ranged camps to spread out as much as possible within their section, centered around their shaman. The biggest thing I can think of other than that is to just be mindful of the fear timer. It's perfectly safe to stand right next to the tail of a doomfire right after a fear is over, and it will despawn before fear is up again for example.<br>
<br>
I'd really like to see some changes made to this fight. I hate that you can, and should if possible, brute force him. Our two kills so far (1-nighted hyjal for our 2nd kill) have been with 5 shamans, 2 dwarf shadow priests, and 1 dwarf healing priest. I personally feel like we haven't mastered the fight, but fear warded shamans dropping instant tremor and the priests/paladins in their group dispelling any shamans that didn't get fear ward instantly so they can do the same just brings down the difficulty SO much. I also hate any fight that makes me chain-shift with shadowform or go without shadowform just because of fear ward. </div>

</div>Melee are usually on top, but if you stack too much melee you increase the likelyhood of bad things happening to all of them at once.  Some of your casters will be running from a doomfire at any given point.  I have not had an Archimonde attempt yet when I did not spend at least 20 seconds of every minute making sure doomfire did not kill me.</div>

</div>I'm not so sure about that, to be honest. We went through hell and back (literally) since the beginning of this expansion with the sole purpose of defeating the Betrayer and freeing Outland from the grips of a ruthless demon and all we are getting (besides the loot of course) is pretty much a /pat in the back. Certainly not the best way to conclude this "chapter" of the story, so to speak. If anything, as has been stated before, Kael'thas feels a lot more epic than a rehashed Leotheras with a couple of extra twists/phases and increased duration.</div>

</div>I actually shift back into shadowform a fair amount on this fight. I have a resto shaman and I have to chug a lot of potions to keep up with shifting on a fight that would otherwise be easy on my mana, but it can be done. Generally I will shift into shadowform right after warding a shaman, but only if the area my group is in is relatively clear of doomfires and a fear isn't about to go off; there's really no point in shifting into shadowform if I'm going to spend 20 of the next 30 seconds of the fear ward cooldown running away from fires or chasing after some shaman trying to dispel his fear.<br>
<br>
I considered respecing for the fight, but I'm already blowing 100g/week respecing for arena healing and my healing gear consists of primal mooncloth which I can't equip without paying 175g to respec tailoring each way (and then 175 more to spec back), random unenchanted/ungemmed karazhan and SSC non-set pieces, and full season 2 arena/honor gear, which I suppose is decent for archimonde. I don't think I'd be THAT much more effective, and 200g/week on respecs is kinda pushing it (I'm sure soon I'll be wanting to respec for Shahraz too since we're pushing for her this week, but I'll probably end up holding myself back on doing that too unless we really need it).</div>

</div>We're using 3 camps of 5-6 casters in each, the 3 marked mages (decursers) position themselves in a triangle, with archimonde being in the middle. Everyone else spreads approx 30 yards away from them to be in decurse range. We also have 2 more resto druids and 1 mage as decursers, who are spread inbetween the main 3 decursers, this way we have whole area around the boss covered. So in overal, whole raid is fairly spread and we don't have Airburts hitting more than 2-3 people.<br>
<br>
As for using shamans as "marks", we got only 3 in guild who are not always available for raiding. So we can only have 2 groups with the totem in them at best. ... Low population <b>RP</b> realm... been around 4 months since last decent shaman applied to us. :&lt;</div>

		<div id="post_message_467729">We are currently at the 3rd night of attempts on him and we had a few heartbreaking 20%ish wipes (and a 15% one) so we are getting there I guess. I just wanted to express my dissatisfaction about how unfun this boss is. I have never been more annoyed to wipe at a boss really. There is no luck component ofcourse, but the margin for error is terribly low at some points. I guess it's a matter of practice for our entire raid force, but the most annoying thing is that every time there's a different person dying so you can't pin it down on someone and replace him. You just have to spend hours wiping hoping this is the fight everything clicks. <br>
<br>
Beyond the obvious grip+air burst combination, it's almost inevitable sometimes that a few people will get doomfired, at which point them getting burst or grip has a large chance to wipe us. It's easy to avoid yes, but it's extremely punishing. Essentially it's a 10 minute fight where you really need every last guy to not lose focus for even 5 seconds or he might die and the raid will wipe. <br>
<br>
I think the soul charge mechanic is what makes this fight so unfun. I would rather it was a bit more forgiving for 1 death. I did read about guilds getting away with 7 deaths or so and hats off to them, but while learning him we have only gotten away with 2 deaths once (which led to an attrition wipe) and it's mostly a wipe when someone dies. I would rather it scaled like it was only the special effect (mana burn, silence etc) on the first soul charge, 3k damage+effect on second, 6k damage+effect on third and a certain wipe at 4th.  It's extremely unforgiving now and for raid groups which have a few decent but not amazing people it hurts a lot to do this encounter, waiting for them to catch up on what you got a few days ago. Let's not even mention how terrible getting someone disconnected while you have him at 50% is and he dies ofcourse. Perhaps I am a bit bitter because I wiped at him recently, but generally I have had much fun wiping in most encounters in tbc with Kael giving me the best memories, but Archimonde is so unfun for me that I am thinking of taking a day off because I will face burnout if I do him again.</div>

</div>Sounds like you're on absolutely the right track, Vex.  I wouldn't worry too much about the range/melee dps balance.  There's certainly no need to stack.  As you've already noticed, the dps requirement isn't all that high.  Your ranged might fall a little short, but if they aren't getting themselves killed, then that's half the battle and you're almost there.<br>
<br>
In my experience, the entire fight just hangs on people not taking daft risks and not taking unecessary Doomfires.  A bit of clear communication on the healers part if they get cut off for a few seconds or if decursers get caught out of range, don't spaz up the Tears and that's really all there is to it.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Our guild were trying this encounter for slightly less than 2 nights, using the 3 teams positioned in triangle around him. Got to around 36% after our first 10 attempts or so on the first day and pretty much always reaching 30-50% on our second day, but still haven't killed him yet. Everyone seem to perform at their best trying to avoid deaths, but "random" unavoidable stuff always seem to wipe us (like Airburst + Grip for example). <br>
<br>
The thing that i'm wondering the most is how does your raid DPS meter look like on the actual kill? <br>
We seem to have a huge problem with ranged dps classes being extremely low, unlike all other encounters. We fit in the 10 minute enrage timer perfectly, but the dmg difference between the melee and casters/ranged is insane. We got him to 34% on our last attempt yesterday and the meters looked something like : Whole melee group (2 warriors, 1 rogue, 1enh shaman, 1 feral druid) had around 10-13% raid dps each. The average dps for the melee group is around 1 - 1.3k each. The 6th on meters was a shadow priest with only 4.5%, the rest were even lower, some lower than MT. (noone died till ~36-37%).<br>
We've gotten Doomfire on melee group only 3 times in 2 days (20-25 attempts each), so i'm wondering if it would be better to bring in another full melee dps group (assuming they spread in 2 camps around archimonde's mob square)?  How would it effect the amount of Doomfire and Airburst on melee? <br>
<br>
I'm pretty sure some guilds tried it so any feedback would be appreciated. As well as tips on how to improve ranged dps in this encounter.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">This fight would be so perfect if they would just remove soul charges completely and lower the enrage timer to prevent wins after mass casualties. Our guild has been stuck on Archimonde for a few weeks, and I'm so completely fed up with constantly wiping because one person touches a doomfire before an airburst (or any of the other 10 ways to die -- thus causing a charge and cascade effect).</div>

</div>Honestly, once you get that first kill it just gets easier and easier. When we first started we were of the opinion that a Soul Charge was <i>always</i> a wipe due to the domino effect. After more and more attempts you won't even think about it. Sure, there's still a lot of ways to die on the fight but you'll eventually get to a point where one death <b>isn't</b> a wipe more often than not. Make sure as soon as someone dies everyone gets topped off, everyone is aware Doomfire = Thaladrad, aware of when Fear is coming, everyone in the raid has a few Purification Potions and, most of all, everyone is relaxed. These are the things that worked for us.<br>
<br>
Our time frame for our kill has gotten smaller and smaller and tonight we wiped at 16% on our first attempt and killed it on the second.<br>
<br>
Stick with it, I know it's a horrible fight but it honestly gets easier and even fun.</div>

My guild was stuck on Archimonde for over a month. Over and over we would constantly have wipes for misc reasons, using 1-2 shamans. Thursday we went with 3 shamans (got a new app) and killed him that night.<br>
<br>
The insanely dramatic effect shamans can have on this encounter is just...... World of difference when ~80% of your raid (3 groups with tremor totem, warriors, fear ward) can for the most part negate the fear. This fight really needs to be re-designed (even though I know it won't be).</div>

As an example if we had all 3 of them ignore cursing our raid dps would increase roughly 15-20% which is significantly less time for bad things to happen.  I was worried about doing it with only 3 decursers originally but soloing it relatively easily makes me think we are just wasting time with 3+ and exposing ourselves to bad luck and lag-in-the-air syndrome.  <br>
<br>
Oddly the past couple weeks we have had a couple nights were exactly 3 people from all over the world would randomly get dced over and over again all night.  Two of us were in the air on the last dc last Archimonde but luckily he was already at 11%.  <br>
<br>
Anyway, just wondering what the 'sweet spot' was for other guilds as far as number of decursers.</div>

		<div id="post_message_479150">Hi there.<br>
<br>
We had our first kill yesterday - was about our 30th try in total I think (4th hour of wipes).<br>
<br>
Just echoing what some people have already stated here - calling out the fear timer, and just simply spamming on voice coms to 'move away from the fire' will do wonders for your raid group's survivability.<br>
<br>
We went with 3 mages and 3 druids (2 ferals) decursing. 3 shaman too, but we moved around so much that the tremor totems didn't do a whole lot. 3 priests and 1 paladin, to bring it up to 8 healers (plus the two ferals, but I think they were even in feral gear, decursing).<br>
<br>
We started off with the whole '3 groups, and a decurser behind to catch the rogues' positioning, but by the end we were just moving as a raid to the side that had the least fire.<br>
<br>
Really, it got to the stage where we just had to heal the MT and 1 (sometimes 2) people with Doomfire.<br>
<br>
Very cool, calm, and not as random as I expected (once we got past the 'random' deaths from not having Tears, trees sneaking up on people, 'lag'...)<br>
<br>
I didn't notice any nasty mid-air combos, but I did make sure that most classes had purification potions for those 'oh shit' moments.<br>
<br>
Nothing special to report on the fears really - we had 3 priests, so between our talent points we broke 50% of the fears, and we're all undead, with 2 minute trinkets (so that probably helped a lot).<br>
<br>
But yeah, can't emphasise the 'stay away from the fires' bit enough. Stay away from the fires (waaaaay away), and you should secure a kill on this guy pretty quickly.<br>
<br>
We even had an airburst on our MT at 15%! That was funny... ha... ha...<br>
<br>
I sure hope he's repeatable next week.</div>

</div>Well, I'm feral spec and usually tanking so I have the feral talent to resist fears (which does work unlike SR on his fears), and I also have full gladiator resto gear from s1/2 so my unbuffed hp is something like 12k+ in my resto set.  Between tremors+resists+trinket I am never feared at the wrong time, and in the event of a doomfire being in the way between me and a guy with decurse I just run right through it without caring at all throwing up barksin and some hots after I get to the guy.<br>
Using pitbull and agro monitor, I can decurse anyone in range before they take a single tick, and also lifebloom the target of the air burst and maybe 1 guy next to him before it even hits them.  <br>
<br>
It's really rather easy with mouse over decurse macros, an agro-alert setup in your ui and a lot of hp.  I'm also really situationally aware and know where most everyone is, so on the off chance someone does get grib+burst (when the burst didn't target them and they were out of range for the decurse which is rare) I just travel form towards them and handle it.<br>
We also make everyone have purification pots just in case, but we've only needed to use one once.  We tell people who are far away to run towards the middle should they get cursed to fix most range issues.<br>
<br>
So, as you can see I have a lot of things going for me that a typical mage doesn't, including the fact that I'm in the middle in melee range with range on everyone (usually the opposite side of the melee to avoid getting bursts myself).  I'm a little hesitant to solely rely on just myself to decurse, but I definitely think 3 mages on top of that is a total waste.  I'll probably try just one next week.</div>

</div>I think you got lucky having only 1 decurser - that and your dps must be a lot closer in to the boss than our setup.<br>
A lot of our ranged dps stands close to max dps range because it creates a lot more room for stepping away from doomfires. A quarter arc around the circle away from doomfire at 40 yards out is a very big distance. The same arc close in is too close.<br>
That said, for us the sweet spot is more based on the fact that we have 4 raiding mages, and 3 raiding resto druids. So having an abundance of decursing isn't really a sacrifice - we're simply taking some dps and healers - and they happen to be able to decurse too.<br>

</div>I'm not sure we use a conventional 180 or 360 strat at all. We divide our raid into 3 - melee, and 2 ranged camps. The ranged camps are dps/heals/decursing together - usually a little under ~2 groups each.<br>
They rotate independently around the boss like the hands of a clock in order to position away from the doomfire.<br>
Perhaps this is what is understood by the 360 strat.<br>

</div>I have to say - while tons of shamans aren't necessary for a kill, more shamans means a lot more dps time on the boss. It's not surprising that the top 50 dps parses for archimonde have 3-4 shamans or more. A FW shaman in the melee group means your rogues get pretty close to 100% dps time on the boss, for example.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I did have one question about doomfires. Do folk actually still 'train' the doomfires? I hear a lot of folk talking about it, but we found it to be incredibly unreliable. We were able to 'control' maybe 20% of the doomfires. And the trainers were usually getting well out of position and gripped/dotted/airbursted really badly. The turning point for us was telling folk to *not* train the doomfires. Simply sidestep them and then get the hell away in preparation for the fear. This kept everyone comfortably in range of their decurser/healer while still being in range of the boss for better dps uptime.<br>
Sometimes this causes insane lakes of fire on one side of the boss, but with a dynamic re-positioning strategy we simply put the entire raid on the other side of the boss whenever that happens.</div>

		<div id="post_message_482679">I'm pretty sure the fear is not ~99 yards... unless the size of the encounter area deceives me. During a few /facepalm type learning attempts, I consistently out ranged the fear by running back when fear cooldown came up. It was a huge loss of dps and I certainly dont recommend it unless you get some huge lag spike.<br>
<br>
As a BM hunter, 36 yard range, I would estimate I ran about twice my shoot range to OOR the fear. ~70 yards sounds about right. I am almost certain I could hunters mark while easily of fear range (100 yard range spell).<br>
<br>

On the topic of fear, I was in a shaman group for the first time the other night... and WOW. Tremor totem is simply amazing.</div>

		<div id="post_message_483951">Our guild finally killed him last night, and I can't tell you the relief it gave me. I won't even tell you the number of attempts we put in.<br>
<br>
The fight is maddening. The previous night to the killshot, it finally looked like we got the "concept" of the fight down. However, almost every single time we would wipe to something that simply cannot be called user error. Airburst + grip, Airburst into a doomfire (somewhat controllable with tear timing), Priests Spirit of Redemption causing double soul charge, double grip (we had someone get grip back to back, ridiculous). It was everything I could do to keep my guild motivated to do this. We'd be perfect up until ~35%, then it'd hit the fan. <br>
<br>
I know my guild is good enough to kill him weekly, but I feel like our killshot was a "stars aligned" kind of kill. No grip + airburst, doomfires that appeared to be spread out and manageable. Tank healing smooth. It was a perfect kill, no deaths at all, but it felt like everything had to align for that to happen. Bad fight design, imo. Hopefully 2.2 will change things.<br>
<br>
Our group makeup was stacked for learning. 2 shamans; resto and enh (a good enh shaman can be amazing in this fight. Tremor totem near the tank and melee gives a healer a real good shot at keeping up the tank during fears without using any cooldowns.) Druid tank, because we have fear ward. Our druid tank took significantly less damage than our warrior tank did. We had, I believe 5 decursers. 4 resto druids and a mage (we respecced some of our other feral tanks, we love druids in our guild.) Decursing was not a problem, but for those who it is, we had a rule that if you got curse, you had to run towards archi, as he was the common point amongst decursers. We'd start the fight with raid icons over heads, but those got erased as they got airbursted. Also, we found that starting in a semicircle worked well, but ending in a large cluster that was equidistant from the two closest doomfires was most effective. Positioning was completely dictated by fire positioning.<br>
<br>
Overall, I'm proud of my guild, but I do feel the death is 1-2 days overdue just due to poor luck.</div>

</div>This is a bounding box issue. The fear's range is calculated from the center of Archimonde (who is naturally huge) while your hit range is calculated from your character to the edge of Archimonde's hit box. There's a few yards lost from the center to the edge of his model, which is why you can use a 100 yard range ability on him and not be hit by a 99 yard ability. You are almost certainly running 99 yards away from the center of Archimonde's model.</div>

If I recall we had 9 healers plus me healing as shadow because I didn't want to bother dpsing while going in and out of shadowform every 25 seconds.

</div>I have 3 shamans in my guild, one of which has drastically reduced playtime recently. I'd love to be able to have that many shamans, I love the class, think they're ridiculously useful, but I just don't have the numbers. But bringing 4 resto druids, and 9 healers total, is quite contrary to what we usually bring to fights.</div>

		<div id="post_message_484137">We finally killed him in a day we had 2 shamans while we kept wiping for 2 weeks (4-5 sessions) with 4-5 shamans. In the end we killed him with 2 shamans, 4 decursers and by using more melee than before. Ironic as it sounds, I think bringing melee is not only good because of their superior dps, but because you can control the fight better by using them. They are all usually pretty clustered up close to him no matter what, so healers and decursers can reach them much easier than some hunter who just got grip and doomfire has cut him off to some awfully weird place. Every healer has quick access to melee because he is standing at the edge of a circle and they are in the circle's middle, while ranged could be at the circle's other edge and it relies only on the healers there to figure out if they are in range quickly. In a funny way it is the opposite problem of the original gruul where having people in the middle of the circle was problematic :P<br>
<br>
Apart from the unlucky burst+mid air grip combo that I can't figure what to do against apart from shadow resist/purification pots, stacking melee up to a degree (we brought 8 or 9, 2 dps warriors, 3 rogues, 2 ferals, 1-2 enh shamans) seems to me the best solution for this fight.<br>
<br>
Also, I would suggest making fr/sr cauldrons for a first kill. We had 2 people at 15% who got bursted with a doomfire on them on our first kill and they survived solely by taking the fr pot we gave them earlier until they got back to the camp. <br>
<br>
As a final note, I haven't done shahraz, but doing archimonde for our guild at least felt more difficult than doing kael. We got kael in 4 nights or so, but each night we saw distinct progress (usually a different phase) while we got archimonde to 15% the second day, 24% a few tries later then spent a couple of days more wiping to him between 50-70%. Our approach to the encounter at the first couple of days was kinda shit (used ferals as decursers, spriests out of form for fearward in an effort to control the fight which only prolonged it too much and failed) but still, I have not seen another fight where momentary loss of focus at <b>any</b> point during the fight has such a chance to lead to a wipe. It's a really demoralising fight and totally unfun in my opinion. I am willing to predict that if the bulk of guilds stuck at kael now reach archimonde, there will be an uproar about the encounter. It's really the only encounter I have seen so far that you really need every last guy to reach top performance, it's a really hard fight to execute even if it seems relatively simple.</div>

</div>I totally agree with these last few posts.  We normally have 2-3 sham and take an average raid of ranged/melee mix.  We can't really stack melee since we don't have a melee heavy roster.  Are others finding a heavy melee raid to help a lot for this fight?<br>
<br>
The fight just does not click for us even after 5 full nights.  We'll go from a 15-20% attempt one night and come back the next day with 4-5 hours of 50-70% attempts.  Our first kill was last week and I can tell we'll dread going there weekly.  It's sad that after a 20 or 30% wipe you don't feel like much progress happened because the next 10+ attempts for us might not even reach 70%.</div>

		<div id="post_message_484356">The major break on this fight for us - and probably any guild that does him is:<br>
<br>
Wichever position you use or how you stack your raid - focus primaly on survival and let everything else be secondary.<br>
<br>
This fight doesn't require top-notch "Theorycrafted2000X-DPS", 9 decursers with Parachute Cloak or a main tank using Deviate Fish to hide underneath a Shrubbery(tm). <br>
<br>
It doesn't require anything more crazy than SURVIVAL - I wrote that again capitalized because it had to be shouted alot in chat/vent before it sunk in.<br>
<br>
I can honestly say this is the only fight in WoW ever(!) that I don't really care too much how I end up on the damage-meter. Sometimes I take extra long routes walking this or that way staying extra clear from Doomfires. I interrupt a late three second Fireball just to decurse someone. I decurse pets! I don't use mana-gems or mana pots for the sake of HP-pots and HP-stones. When there's risk of a fear I move far from any Doomfire instead of risking it for the sake of DPS'ing.<br>
<br>
It's actually that simple - make sure your raid members focus on careing about their personal health and you'll see progress.<br>
<br>
<br>
Edit - About Grip + Burst. We have often used a icon on all decursers. This makes it easy to call out your nearest decurser on vent so you can 'hook' up half way. This is just another example of not caring so much about DPS but blinking 20 yards away from the boss to save a friend (and the raid).</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">The major break on this fight for us - and probably any guild that does him is:<br>
<br>
Wichever position you use or how you stack your raid - focus primaly on survival and let everything else be secondary.<br>
<br>
This fight doesn't require top-notch "Theorycrafted2000X-DPS", 9 decursers with Parachute Cloak or a main tank using Deviate Fish to hide underneath a Shrubbery(tm). <br>
<br>
It doesn't require anything more crazy than SURVIVAL - I wrote that again capitalized because it had to be shouted alot in chat/vent before it sunk in.<br>
<br>
I can honestly say this is the only fight in WoW ever(!) that I don't really care too much how I end up on the damage-meter. Sometimes I take extra long routes walking this or that way staying extra clear from Doomfires. I interrupt a late three second Fireball just to decurse someone. I decurse pets! I don't use mana-gems or mana pots for the sake of HP-pots and HP-stones. When there's risk of a fear I move far from any Doomfire instead of risking it for the sake of DPS'ing.<br>
<br>
It's actually that simple - make sure your raid members focus on careing about their personal health and you'll see progress.<br>
<br>
<br>
Edit - About Grip + Burst. We have often use a icon on all decursers. This makes it easy to call out your nearest decurser on vent so you can 'hook' up half way. Another example of not caring so much about DPS but blinking 20 yards away from the boss to save a friend (and the raid).</div>

	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div><br>
I'm gonna quote this for emphasis.  This is the *key* to the entire fight.  And a "sub" key, is Doomfire.<br>
<br>
Grip is fine. Airburst is fine.  But Doomfire will wreck you.  90% of our deaths on archimonde involve doomfire.  Tell people to avoid it at *all* costs.  I don't care if you don't dps for af ull minute or 2.  You dying is a bigger detriment to the raid.  Save yourself, avoid doomfire.</div>

		<div id="post_message_484457">Well, we've had two kills that would have been wipes if we had only 1% less dps then we do.  Sometimes, really unlucky things happen, like airburst into a doomfire, immediately airbursted when you get back, strait into another doomfire and then feared 2.9s into a heal and then gripped while you are out of tremor range and just used your trinket on the last fear.  Even with 14-15k hp as a druid hotting myself and using barkskin I was unable to survive that, and I even got a couple heals from others.<br>
My motto is to maximize dps while staying alive.  Obviously staying alive takes precedence, but the more dps the less time for silly things to happen.  When you say stuff like "ignore dps and just survive" you would be amazed just how much a lot of people actually listen to you.  Mages are more then capable of doing at least 800dps while canceling every spell to decurse, yet lots of logs have them doing 300.   I guess it just comes with practice, but I think your best chance of repeated success is to focus on all aspects of the fight including dps rather then simply surviving at all costs.</div>

</div>Doomfire isnt that bad.  I'm not saying your dps should aim for them or anything but they also shouldn't avoid dpsing or healing for 2 minutes because of them.  Tell your druids to set their raid frames to show who has it and then just pop a high ranked rejuve on them, swiftmend it  if they're too low.  We use 3 camps a couple healers to each side and I tell the healers with me to concentrate on the tank and I'll concentrate on them and the doomfires, works great.  But don't read this and think we don't wipe, we do :P We just aren't frightened of doomfires.</div>

		<div id="post_message_484614">Some people need to be more cautious; others are playing more cautious than they need to be (making attempts take longer if they're dps, or risking tank death by being out of healing range longer than necessary if they're healers). Best way to figure this out is parse your wws in a very detailed way over many attempts: then you can actually target your advice and improve the raid. Blanket advice is not going to work as well. It takes a lot of individual adjustment, and what may work for one attempt won't work for the next attempt, depending on how much you're individually targeted for abilities.<br>
<br>
I'd say the only absolute is that you shouldn't crater.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">This is a bounding box issue. The fear's range is calculated from the center of Archimonde (who is naturally huge) while your hit range is calculated from your character to the edge of Archimonde's hit box. There's a few yards lost from the center to the edge of his model, which is why you can use a 100 yard range ability on him and not be hit by a 99 yard ability. You are almost certainly running 99 yards away from the center of Archimonde's model.</div>

</div>Ah, makes sense.<br>
<br>
Similar to Azgalor RoF I guess. We only had 6 healers for him one night so we just cheesed it up and used melee on the adds, the raid ~35 yards away and tank getting chain fired. Made a few people laugh who havent heard of that method before!</div>

</div>First - "ignore dps and just survive" isn't something I wrote - you might actually want to read what's written. I'll quote myself "focus primaly on survival and let everything else be secondary". That means from your perspective "focus primaly on survival and let DPS be secondary".<br>
<br>
The example you'r pulling - is nothing short of a description of "worst luck ever". Sometimes the Worst Of Luck beats Skill silly. I also know that most "unlucky" situations can countered with skillfull playing and understanding the encounter. This is so true especially for Archimonde since skill in this encounter is to survive and the actions/reactions are all connected like Domino-pads. I'll 'counter' some of your happenings by throwing a few things from the book of survival:<br>
<br>
<b>Gripped out of tremor range</b>- can be countered by having more than 1 decurser in the raid I know we usually run with 2-3 mages and 2 resto druids thats alot of overlapping. Bringing decursing consumables.<br>
<b>Trinket on CD</b> - If you position yourself carefully there are not many times you actually need to use the trinket. Why use the trinket just to gain some more DPS. I find myself saving it for a o-shit moment. If I position myself correctly well in time before a fear - the o-shit moment are unlikely to happen. When trinket is on CD I'm also extra carefull when the next fear is incoming. <br>
<b>Airbursts-upon-Airburst-upon-etc</b> - I've esacpe numerous airburst by thinking and adding awareness to other thing than my normal stopcast-bar. Archimonde always targets his Air Burst-victim - for me atleast - this is enough time to read the name on ToT-frame and remember if it's one of the persons who stands near me. If it is - then I just move from him. If it's me -I pull back trying to save some nearby friends of the hassel. Just spend some time during raid thinking of who runs in and out of your close vincinity. It does wonders.<br>
<b>Call for help</b> - A few times I've been shit out of luck. When your all out of cards to play or know that your might get out on deep water shortly - call it out on vent. <br>
<br>
Nice example would be my raid yesterday. Probably the most irritating and anoying downing of Archimonde I've done so far. Impressing series of Doomfires (100k fire-dmg on me) and I was quite near dying a good amount of times. Calling out on vent, spending mana on shields, hp-pots, hp-stones and so on made me survive. I didn't really get much done that fight but leading Doomfires away from the raid, take damage, decurse abit and deal some damage. But hey ho - eventually I was standing there with everything on cd wanding Archimondes last 10% - down he went.<br>
<br>
I'm <b>100% sure</b> that we would have wiped that downing if I had been less focused on survival but more trying to max-DPS that raid. I still claim that Archimonde isn't a fight that scales down in difficulty, if you reduce the length of the encounter, the same way it does on a luck based fight like Mother Shahraz or a DPS-race like Gruul. Archimonde is a slow and controlled chaos steadily bringin his HP down. Most of the chaotic things can be controlled - heck even Doomfires can we lead away from the raid by smart raiders instead of creating a maze around the raid.<br>
<br>
I'm not trying to imply throwing candy at Archimond will do the trick - some level of DPS is still needed. <br>
<br>
One fact is sure for us - when everyone focus on surviving we 1-shot him. The times we've gone in DPS-racing - those are also the times we've wiped the most.</div>

<br>
Anyway the archimonde of the first half of this thread is not the same archimonde of today.  Not by a longshot.  Losing control of your character through MC and fears is basically retarded - and only seeing 3-4 fears per kill now changes things a lot.  I'd be amazed if any guild that killed him pre-hotfix is not consistently 1 shotting him today; whereas they may have struggle for upwards of an hour on him prior to the hotfix to rekill.  It was night and day for us.  The fear still needs to go.  Its just fucking stupid that in this day and age we're seeing that trash in an "end game" encounter.  Add something to the difficulty that like AE's, or KB's, or lasers - anything but a damn fear.  <br>
<br>
Our last kill he went from 75% to 35% without a single fear... talk about consistent (devs claimed it would be, but they said that about nightbane also).</div>

Wait, what? Can you elaborate? I'm not interested in doing it, but rather in knowing what it is. We oneshot Archimonde weekly, so it's not like we need it - but afaik, if you pull Archimonde near the World Tree he instagibs the raid? I'm confused.</div>

There are things that are obviously not meant to be done, even if they can be. Running out of the room in Netherspite was one, and lord knows how many arguments we heard about "HE'S ROOTED, THERE MUST BE A REASON".<br>
<br>
The encounter is literally Golemagg with a fear if Doomfires/Bursts are an nonissue. I don't see any way any one can think that eliminating the need to control/deal with doomfire as an intended strategy by Blizzard.<br>
<br>
I'm sorry, but my subjective opinion about this is that it's beyond even being subjective.<br>
<br>
Edit: well, I came off sounding a little arrogant. What I mean to say is, if people kill him that way, good for them... it's arguably within game mechanics as it is at the moment. (We'll just see how much uproar there is when/if Blizzard fixes the issue) On the other hand, saying Blizzard intended it to be done that way is a bit of a stretch... especially after they explicitly patched the water to prevent the exact same scenario.</div>

Knowing that you're going to be running around an out of control of your character makes sure that people can prepare for the future rather than just reacting to the present.

</div>I'm surprised anyone can justify something as inconsistent as fear's current implementation. It might fear you straight into a fire 40 yards away, it might make you run just out of range of a decurser, it might resist, it might  simply run you as far as possible away from the fight so it takes you a chunk of time just to run back. That sort of unpredictability should not exist and the fact that they keep using it encounter after encounter simply shows that they're too uncreative (or lazy?) to come up with new encounter mechanics for raid wide effects.</div>

<br>
Fear and MC are two mechanics I find dull, over-used and non-inventive, atleast Chromaggus' version was controllable and more fitting than "oh and he MCs you".<br>
<br>
The pure fact of how Shamans alone can effect this fight significantly just show how flawed it is as a mechanic, if any class had a way to make people immune to MC you can bet your raid would end up loaded with them on encounters that have it.<br>
<br>
They need to make these 'ultra boss abilities' uncounterable by means of outside-event items, racials or class specific benefits, but with a way inside the encounter to control it somewhat.<br>
<br>
This is again one reason why Kael is quite good (exception of MC/fear), you have quite alot of abilities (pyro, disorientate, conflag, fireballs), of which you counter with use of the mechanics of the fight</div>

</div>Some randomness (Crits, tank crushings, etc) add "challenge", other randomness (See running 100 yards away from a healer through fire uncontrollably, Mother Shahraz) just adds a luck and bullshit factor to an encounter.  When you down a boss do you prefer to think you did it because you mastered the encounter or because you simply had a good run with the RNG? Fear could be used in the former situation, but most of Blizzard's use of it leans towards the latter. Think back to Magmadar when fear could be out of ranged before it went off. That added some random challenge of fears going into fire, but it was controllable because you could choose to not be in range of the fear at all. Archimonde is a totally different story due to the nature of the Doomfires and the duration of the fears.</div>

</div>Soul charge cascades from a single death can very much wipe the raid if it's at a bad time. It doesn't happen often, but when you get a death because of a random factor such as where fear sends you it's frustrating. I'll agree there are a lot of ways you can improve the odds of this never happening, but sometimes you're just screwed. That aspect of it is something I think they need to eliminate from encounters and tweaking fear or just not using its mechanic over and over would go a long way towards helping that.</div>

		<div id="post_message_484970">Sure, you got feared into a fire even though it was 40 yards away because everything was on cooldown.

<br>
Edit after your edit: yes it can sometimes screw you. But it's not nearly as often as some people think. Myself, I'll rarely take a wipe to randomness if it makes the fight more interesting overall. I can see how that is not everyones cup of tea though.</div>

		<div id="post_message_484974">Yeah, the point is that while fear is not controllable, your raid's positioning relative to Doomfire is.<br>
<br>
People will get feared into Doomfires, but it shouldn't be more than a couple, and it shouldn't be more than your healers can handle if people play it right.  You can use PvP trinkets to mitigate the situations where you absolutely cannot afford to be feared or you will wipe the raid, and you can provide tremor totems to further stabilize the couple of groups that really need to be fairly clumped and near Archimonde (melee and a healer/decurser group, if nothing else).  If you have a bunch of people standing 15yd from an active Doomfire, who really don't need to be there, and they get feared into it, that's poor tactical execution on their part, not poor "luck."<br>
<br>
Personally I agree -- the Fear mechanic on an individual level can be frustrating, but it keeps the encounter dangerous, unpredictable, and uncontrollable.  When we wipe, 100% of the time, it's because some people made mistakes.  I really enjoy the fight still, every week, three months after our first kill.</div>

		<div id="post_message_485104">Good ol' Dots.  This isn't about wiping or not wiping.  It isn't about blaming the RNG for your deaths.  It's about losing control of your character.  It is about poor encounter design.  <br>
<br>
Fear is just dumb.  It is like Mind control on razuvious.  It is like BWL loot tables. It is like Archimonde 1.0 sitting there wondering if you'll get a doomfire in the raid on your kill, making it 100 times easier.  In one sense fear is added as a terrible patch-job by devs to increase difficulty when development is too inane to come up with something better, and in another sense it is to add randomness to the encounter.  <br>
<br>
Why do you need to have a fear?  You can add another RNG item like an AE that is jukeable that is also "dangerous and unpredictable".  I just don't see how "uncontrollable" is fun - even if its on a trivial fight.  I keep watching this demo of flight simulator and I'm blown away by how "fun" watching a demo is...<br>
<br>
What about Loatheb, or Solarian - these fights employ abilities that make the fight suck, yet you're going to 1 shot these every time.  Consumable and group stacking, AE abilities that make sense for design, but lack in quality in implementation.  Yet they're not RNG based, they just suck.  Is this now another story because its not RNG or "difficult"?  Are mark of solarian and impending doom different issues than fear?<br>
<br>
Encounter design is something that goes beyond difficulty.  It should be innovative, fun, challenging, and engaging.  These issues are rarely seen in TBC bosses to the extent they have been in the past.  Kael'thas is an example of how to do an end-boss.  Illidan and Vashj are examples of how to do an end-boss.  Archimonde is an example of a boss that was never well tuned, and is a hodgepodge of 1 stage abilities, some of which are uncontrollable, that are thrown at you to give you some semblance of difficulty.  Yet tweak one number too far left or right, and it goes from overly difficult to far too simple (as it is today).  Reminds me of another shitty fight that is about to make the same transition.  <br>
<br>
Archimonde could be so much better than the fight it is today (I actually enjoy the encounter, my problem is with the fear component).  I'm sure you can look at this fight and see ways to improve upon it.  Surely we're not all sitting here eating Blizzard's shit and thinking "hey, thats as good as it gets kids."  Sapphiron's all around, cheers!<br>
<br>
Just some ideas that would be far better than "fear" (imo):<br>
-Add falling debris that instagib (and do it right, not the magtheridon nonsense).  <br>
-Add a 1 pulse random direction earthquake that breaks positioning and casts.<br>
-Add a targeted AE like a void zone (don't make it like Az'galor's RoF).<br>
-Have a phase 2 where adds need to be dealt with while managing existing doomfires - 1 range tank 1 melee tank, range tank mob has a fear (appropriate use of a fear would be the panic on vashj's adds - an avoidable fear with penalty, unless you're a tauren - you get cooked because you were dumb, not because your tremor totem didn't pulse as a doomfire spawned)<br>
-Have some sort of uber move you need to survive every 25% - perhaps a forced soul charge.  <br>
<br>
This game needs more skill elements and less stupid abilities like fear.  Less things like ironshields and mana pots, and more items like swiftness and rage pots.  <br>
<br>
My experience with fear on our last kill was basically seeing 4 or 5 total fears, and none of them affected the fight in the slightest because we had shamans, and stood a long ways from the doomfires.  Before the hotfix the fast fear changed my tanking style and created a havoc of problems for positioning and groups (coupled with gripped people being at 60+ yards out).  The fear could come every 30 seconds and last 7 or 8 seconds?  It was just dumb - frustrating comes to mind... not "fun".  The fear now is a joke, and just is a remnant of an older encounter practically.<br>
<br>
What is wrong with the idea of making Archimonde very difficult, while not relying on fear to do it?</div>

		<div id="post_message_485112">I like Archimonde as a fight, and I'm unsure why you think a raid wide fear is some sort of copout design element by Blizzard.  Certainly it could be a completely different fight alltogether, but it isn't.  It is what it is, and when its all said and done, for all its random elements it isn't the sort of beatdown that both Kael and Mother are to learn.  In its current state most people report having an easier time with it every week and yet it's still an encounter where everyone has to pay 100% attention the entire fight if you want to win.  Fear takes away control of your character and sends you on a walk for a couple seconds and while I will agree that it has been used before, I hardly think thats reason enough to never use it again.<br>
<br>
Which brings me to a different point regarding "random elements."  Why is it that the very thing people love so much about PvP is the one thing they hate to find in PvE?  I hear all the time that the greatest rush of arena is the not knowing what your opponent will do and having to react to a constant flow of random elements that no Computer A.I. could ever simulate.  Toss one random element into a PvE encounter that noone can control and people become upset.<br>
<br>
Perhaps we carry too many assumptions about raiding to ever deserve truly innovative content.  We *expect* content to get easier everytime we succeed at it.  We *expect* boss fights to get harder as we progress through the zone and loot to become better for each successive boss.  We *expect* all elements of a fight to be controllable if we understand all the variables.  We *expect* every boss in the game to be beatable if we bang our heads against it long enough.<br>
<br>
I'm as guilty of these assumptions as anyone else, but I'm willing to admit that as we become better and better raiders, the game is going to have to start challenging our assumptions about raiding more and more.  The game is training us to be shrewd and skilled opponents and we may see the day where the only way a boss offers any sort of challenge is through uncontrollable random elements.</div>

		<div id="post_message_485127">We had a small discussion some time back on how Archimonde may have been so much more engaging, if he'd been tuned for ~15-18 people, and instead have waves of increasingly tough undead storm the Night Elf camp. <br>

You'd have to basically kill Archimonde before the entire camp is overrun, and there would be some leeway in the strategy/division - you could either put more people at the camp to sustain the fight longer (if you have fewer people in the raid able to succesfully click the Tear/dodge doomfires) or put less and rape Archimonde in fewer waves.<br>
<br>
Would have been hell to tune correctly, but it may have given options for guilds with more than a few brain-dead people. Not to mention making the fight less one-dimensional. Taurens and their beatsticks were an amazing experience - now why not have Ancients joining the fray along with bear cavalry and friendly flying NPCs (!!!) raining down death from above?<br>

		<div id="post_message_485139">The odd thing is simply how Archimonde managed to stealth past the entire night-elf base and start sapping the World Tree without them noticing.<br>
Every other base got ravaged by the Burning Legion in order to get access there, but aparently it wasn't needed.<br>
<br>
Archimonde currently is an "enjoyable" fight because he is an easy fight, a walkover in comparison to Kael and you only need to have half a brain in order to repeat the kill on him, not to mention there is 0 trash.<br>
<br>
He was and still is implemented poorly, if what Blizz said about them wanting us to get purples was the methology behind this fight, then they should of had a couple of sign-posts along the 'road' of MH like you would on the side of a motorway.<br>
<br>
<br>
They could of simply added a P1 like on Nef which involved some crappy adds for 5mins to give you the feeling that there is something happening and your involved in the actual event.<br>
<br>
You talk to Tyrande Whisperwind, she starts the small event (like in the previous bases), you defend vs a couple of waves and then she shouts something like:<br>
"Heros! we've been tricked! Archimonde has bypassed us and even now draws power from the World Tree, quick you must stop him before it is too late!"<br>
"We will hold back the hordes of the Burning Legion while deal with Archimonde, may Elune be with you".<br>
<br>
It would basicly turn the fight into Nef v2, but it would add alot more impact into the feeling of the fight, even if you changed nothing about Archimonde himself.<br>
<br>
You could even then have the enrage-timer being related to the survival of the NE base rather than simply after 10mins he decides to finger your entire raid because he has a short form of ADD and wants to do something else.<br>
<br>
There was just so much potential about this cool boss, so many ways you could involve people within the story and it all got wasted.<br>
<br>
<br>
If they wanted people to see the 'history zone' and get some purplez along the way, they could of simply opened up the real Hyjal and added a couple of DM arena type events passing players could do every couple of hours and at the end there would be a chest at the World Tree like in the STV arena.<br>

Just some ideas that would be far better than "fear" (imo):<br>
-Add falling debris that instagib (and do it right, not the magtheridon nonsense).  <br>
-Add a 1 pulse random direction earthquake that breaks positioning and casts.<br>
-Add a targeted AE like a void zone (don't make it like Az'galor's RoF).<br>
-Have a phase 2 where adds need to be dealt with while managing existing doomfires - 1 range tank 1 melee tank, range tank mob has a fear (appropriate use of a fear would be the panic on vashj's adds - an avoidable fear with penalty, unless you're a tauren - you get cooked because you were dumb, not because your tremor totem didn't pulse as a doomfire spawned)<br>
-Have some sort of uber move you need to survive every 25% - perhaps a forced soul charge.  </div>

</div>They could of used erm.. Finger of Death? an ability everyone knows and loves about Archimonde before WoW. It seems quite stupid that he has 2 'clean-up' abilities to wipe the raid quicker when you let your MT die.<br>
<br>
Ways you could have it?<br>
<br>
He starts to cast (as in 3-5sec) it on a player, much like Infernal on Anetheron, and it does a meteor-esk damage, so people need to group up on the player to stop it being an insta-gib.<br>
<br>
He could use it as a channeled ability, he stops hitting the MT and casts it on any random player in the raid, and that person needs to be healed through 2500 damage/second for 5 seconds.<br>
<br>
You could also have it as a 'phase', where every 25% he yells "Enough with you all, feel the might of the Burning Legion", you get a few seconds as grace time untill he starts spamming Finger of Death on random people in the raid for 8k damage around 10 times.<br>
<br>
<br>
I mean theres no need to go finding hugely exotic ways to make the encounter hard, he has built-in abilities you could do great things with and keep him feeling like the Archimonde we know and love from Warcraft 3...</div>

</div>Personally I find "instagib" mechanics annoying, because there's no recovery -- oops, you weren't paying attention for a second there, boom you're dead.  I'd much prefer a penalty that through subsequent skilled play you can recover from.  Doomfire is a good example.<br>
<br>
Cast-breaking movement is sort of a annoying and not that tactically interesting.  Oops, my cast got disrupted, guess I'll just start it again.  You wouldn't prep for that the way you do a fear.  Plus it doesn't hurt melee that much.  Or druids for that matter, 95% of my casts that fight are instant.<br>
<br>
I don't think we need Yet Another AoE Damage, especially when the melee classes need to group up.  And by the time we're at Archimode I've had my fill of waves of adds, thanks. <br>
<br>
Fundamentally I just don't understand the hatred of the fear mechanic.  It's just one of the many things that bosses can do.  It's a mechanic that has a bunch of interesting tactical implications -- the need to get hots on the MT and others taking damage so that they survive it, the need to position yourself so that you're unlikely to get doomfired, the need to  get back into position post-fear while maintaining your other duties, etc.  All in all, I think it's one of the more interesting mechanics Blizzard has at their disposal.  But like I said earlier, Archimonde is my favorite fight in TBC, even in its currently slightly too-easy state.</div>

</div>If any Blizzard posters are reading this, by the way, thanks for balancing the fight with such a long duration fear. It's the first fight, in, well, my memory where I've felt really happy about having Tremor, and felt like it was really useful. Yeah, there've been tons of other fear bosses, but their fear durations are short enough anyway that Tremor can easily do -nothing- so my thoughts are more like "Well, I'll drop Tremor, can't hurt."</div>

</div>Let's see:<ul><li>Your pvp trinket was down</li>
<li>You weren't in a shaman group</li>
<li>You had 0 priests/paladins in a shaman group or with WOTF or fear ward  or divine shield in range of you</li>
<li>You had 0 priests/paladins with a pvp trinket that wasn't on cooldown in range</li>
<li>Every priest/paladin that was in range and had one of the above spilled coffee in their lap and couldn't find their cleanse/dispel keys or couldn't click on you as you slowly pathed into the doomfire</li>
</ul>I'm also kind of surprised I haven't seen anyone suggest the use of mass dispel when you lack shamans (although I may have just missed it; the thread is pretty long now). We only had 2 shamans on our last kill and I found it to be very effective to fear ward myself if I had time after the shaman I was warding, then mass dispel clumps of people so that the MD landed the exact time, or very close after, the fear landed. It was especially effective to get healers and decursers, even if they're not near doomfire. I'd then run around dispelling individuals headed toward doomfire until everyone was safe or the fear expired.<br>
<br>
Horde could do the same with undead priests using WOTF and pvp trinkets, and speccing into .5s mass dispel would actually be pretty beneficial for either faction using MD. MD wouldn't be as useful if you had 3-5 shamans since most people would break quickly anyway, but breaking your own fear and single dispelling people at risk of fire is always great. If you're worried about the mana cost, which costs more: healing through a doomfire debuff on even a single person, or mass dispelling? Add in the mana cost of a soul charge or preventing doomfire from hitting more than 1 person with a MD, or breaking a healer's/decurser's fear so they can prevent another person's death and it's a no-brainer.</div>

I still believe adding difficulty to encounters should consist of more than just "Well, it's too easy. Lets add Fear or MC". Taking control away from the players is a cop-out in my eyes. It's not like they can't come up with other methods of adding difficulty as was posted above. Teron Gorefiend is an excellent example of a fight that was basically tank and spank but with a unique difficulty element that made the encounter refreshing in a way.</div>

		<div id="post_message_485372">Well my intent was more to inform, and point out the numerous counters to fear, as some of them are often forgotten (you personally may have not been able to do anything more, but someone in your raid could). It's in my nature to be an ass when I offer criticism, constructive as it may be.<br>
<br>
On a slightly different note, after having done the fight more (and shahraz a good number of times, both of which are touted as highly random), it seems that the difficulty stems mostly from the average raider's ability to react and cope with random elements, not from the random elements themselves being difficult. As Ribeye was getting at in post #610, it takes a better player to react to a dynamic situation than to be given "A-&gt;B-&gt;C-&gt;D-&gt;Loot" instructions to execute. As players get better at reacting on the fly, the encounter becomes noticeably easier; it's not just a dice roll every time. If it continues to feel like a dice roll, it's likely some of your players aren't improving their play ability.</div>

</div>The example you gave earlier made it sound a bit like it. Just like you assume that I claimed you suck, but I didn't.<br>
<br>
The point is, while the fear is totally random on an individual basis, it is very much possible to deal with it as a raid entity. But Praetorian, Ribeye and some others already put it much better than I could.</div>

		<div id="post_message_485465">I don't see how a trivial introduction phase would add thrill to the encounter. If it's not trivial I would have to disagree, the fight is hard enough already as it is. It depends on your guild, but I found archimonde to be much harder than kael for us. Adapting to tactics, learning about new abilities, burning down the weapons before advisors and the then advisors before kael, sure. The crucial kael phases (2+3) last for 5 minutes total and the biggest danger is really some mob instagibbing people who moves a lot slower than doomfires do. And if someone dies to him, that's fully recoverable. Archimonde is not at all like that, a fight which requires absolute focus for 10-12 minutes for every single second of it is a hard fight to execute in my book. <br>
<br>
I don't think fear is what makes archimonde annoying, I have seen fear in lots of encounters before and I always liked it, because it really gave you the impression that you were fighting against a much more powerful entity that had power to destroy your raid's planning. I think the problem lies in soul charge. In a fight that takes that long, a mechanic that has a large chance to wipe you in the case only 1 of your raid members loses focus for a few seconds or disconnects or gets grip midair or whatever is just too unforgiving. Sure you can survive it, but from the moment someone dies and soul charge will go off, it's a gamble more or less. In a perfect scenario noone would take damage from grip or doomfire but I am willing to be it happens in every archimonde fight for every guild and that if you get soul charge on a bad moment, wiping potential goes up by tons. <br>
<br>
I think soul charge should be 'stacking' in sorts, like do no damage and just cast the side effect first time you get it, do a 3k aoe without knockback second time, do the current one at 3rd death and just instagib the raid at 4th one. Or maybe do the same 1 death sooner, 3 deaths shouldn't be allowed either I guess, would propably be too easy. Having such a high chance to wipe when something happens to only 1 of your raid members seems like a nice concept but it's totally unfun in practice. It's rewarding when you get him, but when you look back at your tries, you only remember being stressed and on the edge all the time.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I don't see how a trivial introduction phase would add thrill to the encounter. If it's not trivial I would have to disagree, the fight is hard enough already as it is. It depends on your guild, but I found archimonde to be much harder than kael for us. Adapting to tactics, learning about new abilities, burning down the weapons before advisors and the then advisors before kael, sure. The crucial kael phases (2+3) last for 5 minutes total and the biggest danger is really some mob instagibbing people who moves a lot slower than doomfires do. And if someone dies to him, that's fully recoverable. Archimonde is not at all like that, a fight which requires absolute focus for 10-12 minutes for every single second of it is a hard fight to execute in my book. </div>

</div>10-12mins of focus eh? Well to be fair it must require a DAMN huge amount of focus to survive upto 2mins of his enrage (which is 10mins).<br>
<br>
The fight is between 5-8mins for the most part, once you have the survival part sorted on your raid you can put more emphasis on DPS to bring the kill faster.<br>
<br>
Kael is far more complex, Archimonde is Fear, Doomfire, Airburst and nothing else really, if someone dies it tends to be a wipe untill you get moderatly good at it so you dont really have to learn how to deal with soulcharges much, if you get one, you put everything on hold and try to survive its inital damage and the silence if its there and then you continue as normal.</div>

It will also be very rare this happens because 40 yards is a long distance to cover, usually I have people in my guild move 20 yards out when the fear cooldown is up.<br>
<br>
The fear mechanic in this fight isn't really an issue with boss mods, you can do stuff to stay alive (ie move far away from fire). The area is large.</div>

</div>I stand corrected then, even if I had the impression we had fought him for quite more than 10 minutes at a 24% wipe, but it must have been the tension causing me some sort of time dilation. But for the rest of it, as I told you, different guilds excel at different fights. Complexity doesn't scare me, relying on reflexes scares me more. Kael has a ton more abilities but on their own they are a lot less deadly and a lot easier to avoid and even if someone falls victim to them they are far more recoverable. We spent 15 hours including trash reclears at kael, we spent 25 hours before we killed archimonde. A lot of them were disconnect wipes or wiping because we had new people who took 2 deaths each until they figured tears and the layout, but they were still wipes. But maybe we are just odd in the end or we had a couple of bad weeks when we tried him.</div>

		<div id="post_message_485877">After we've now downed him twice I must say that after the first few stupidity wipes (fall damage), I really really like this fight. As a lifebloom Druid Doomfire is just so much damage that I only have to put up 1 lifebloom every 7 seconds to outheal it so effectivly I could heal my whole group if we all had a Doomfire dot running for some reason.<br>
<br>
We're a Horde guild so we don't have a Druid tank, but on both our kill tries we had 3 Shamans and 9 Healers (once 1 lb Druide once 2) in the Raid and due to tremor totem I only had to use my PvP insignia twice. As I tried to point out above if someone in my range (we use a 3 camp+Melee camp setup) gets Doomfire I can let my lifeblooms really shine, as Doomfire feels like it has been built in extra for us Druids  (long Duration, low damage).<br>
<br>
The only things about this fight that  I might say isn't as it should be is the big difference betwen Horde and Alliance. Fearward really makes this fight alot easier (Feral tank vs Warrior tank). The other thing that one might not see as such a good idea is the needed Shaman stacking (less than 3 and you're asking for trouble), but this is afaik the first fight where a tremor totem is needed (yes on some fights it  was nice in pre TBC but it was never "needed") which isn't to bad.<br>
<br>
Overall I'd just like to reinforce my point that I really like this fight alot more than any other one in Mt Hyjal. This is partly due to it being the only fight without stupid trash but also partly because as a Druid I like being able to heal and decurse while having to look out to what is happening to everyone else (i.e. if someone just got grip and is now flying I can travelform after him and save him! Yay!  )<br>
<br>
<br>
/edit that's what I get for not refreshing before posting :&amp;<br>
<br>
For us Kael'thas was alot worse simply because the fight goes on for so long (and because I think our phoenix workout is wrong but that's beside the point). We wiped for ages vs Kael for our first kill, about 5-6 Raiddays for our second kill and the same time again for the third time. Archimonde was a totaly different matter we had our first set of tries the week before last with 3 Shamans and only 8 healers with our best try being 37% (which was more luck than anything else imho). Then last week we had Monday and Tuesday with tries against him and on Tuesday everything just clicked (9 healers, 3 or 4 Shamans) on our second try that Day he was down. Wednesday hit and with that a fresh Mt Hyjal id and again our third try of the night landed us a Archimonde kill. I think this has alot to do with our attention span and/or our ability to concentrate for long periods of time (Kael was a ~25-30 min fight with a fresh trash clear every 2 hours). Maybe this is also part of why I like Archi so much </div>

The Hunter/Druid/Whatnot one is very easily healed through (4800 damage over 8 seconds or so) and if nothing bad is happening the +50% damage one isn't bad either. We've also healed through the silence a few times (notice: the duration of the silence isn't always the same, sometimes it's 1-2 seconds and sometimes 5-8 seconds). With enough healers (we bring 9) healing through soul charges isn't such a pain if everyone else is doing everything right (but atleast for us if someone screws up, concentration is lost and someone else will probably die soon).</div>

</div>I dont disagree with the damage, it's the stun and silence part I disagree with.  It's the stun/silence parts that wipe a raid.  Once someone dies we're pretty good at toping everyone off, or anyone low immediately uses a consumable before the charge is used.  We can usually live through one death if enough of us resist the silence and/or stun.  But it's always hte stun/silence part that's the wiper.</div>

<br>
- Engaging; all player need to be on their toes. I hate fights where the usual suspects can stand in a corner and press one button while watching anime.<br>
- Unique; there are mechanics we haven't seen before, like the Air Burst/Tears.<br>
- Challenging; a flawless player will NOT die on Archimonde (except if in the unlikely event you get Grip/Burst/Purification Pot on cd). Several of my guildmates has never died "first" there. Don't we all love an encounter that separates the wheat from the chaff? <br>
- Quick recovery; no trash, short run<br>
- Rewarding; besides nice loot, you get a good sense of accomplishement to down him after 30-40 tries.<br>
<br>
The only problem with it is that the last 10% is too easy. And longer fears please, make the dispellers work more!</div>

		<div id="post_message_486683">As I said, soul charge's effect should be scaling with deaths and have a wider effect each time, making it an instant wipe at the 3rd or 4th death, a challenging recovery at the 2nd death and a minor inconvinience for 1 death. 1 death should just not be punished so much even if the focus of the fight is survival. I agree that if soul charge was just nerfed the encounter would be ridiculously easy for a t6 endboss.<br>
<br>
Other than that I agree that the fight has some nice unique elements, but they are combined with some overused ones  (decurse/fear) to make for a mediocre experience. He is also kinda anticlimatic compared to the final mission of wc3. I really expected something totally different. <br>
<br>
I personally prefer encounters that you only rely on a specific part of the raid, like you rely on rogues/warriors for RoS, like you rely on mages/hunters for maulgar, like you relied on priests for razuvius (apart from the stupid resist/break chance). I think relying so much on the whole raid is a flawed design because very few guilds can field raids with that quality of players. Also, people tend to lose focus after a certain number of wipes, which is necessary for this encounter.</div>

From a Raidgrp coordination perspective I finde Kael'thas alot worse because you didn't only have to do it right, you had to push out certain amounts of dps whilst doing it right. While fighting Archimonde you can just "stack" (I wouldn't call taking 9 healers stacking but some might) healers and you're golden, as long as you have 3 Shamans with you otherwise fear might be too punishing if the fight drags on for a long time.</div>

		<div id="post_message_486767">You can easily heal through doomfire, problem is when someone gets bursted with doomfire ticking or someone hitting a newly spawned doomfire while running back to camp. The odds of getting a doomfire+burst, a grip+burst or doomfire+soul charge stack up to be high. And you only need it to happen to 1 person to get a wipe. Ranged dps were the problem for us and the usual death victims about 80% of the time, because they would have a limited amount of decursers/healers to take care of them in case anything went wrong. If they got cut off in a weird place by doomfire or bursted with one they would typically die. <br>
<br>
We got the kill by using more melee than usual (8-9 instead of 5-6, 1 of them an enh shaman), 8 healers (1 shaman healer) and 8 ranged dps standing spread out in one area behind him to synchronise their movement. We abandoned any idea of trying to control the fight through stacking shamans or having people out of form fear warding and finally got it in a 7-7:30 minute kill by trying to just burn him as fast as possible. Hectic, but worked.</div>

</div>This is self inflicted agony (because using just 1 Shaman IS agonising imho).<br>
<br>
@Lymmel For us it made a BIG difference switching those people who always got DF (or at least alot more than others) to spriest/druid groups while using 9 healers (3 heal Shamans; 2 Trees). But as I said before we used 4 ranged camps who are basicly self sustaining (decurse/heal) with 2 camps where you can be or get into range quickly for those oh shit moments. As a Druid for me it's just cool that when someone gets DF/Grip (well that can't happen anymore but it used too) and busted I could travelform/cat sprint back to them and save them (just because 1 death doesn't have to be your demise but it COULD be!). This is why I so love this encouter =)</div>

</div>You don't need to be Alliance to only have 1-2 Shamans. We've had two raiding Shamans for an age, and there don't seem to be any currently in the recruitment market for us, even though we're the #2 horde guild on our server. Actually, sadly enough, we only ever recruited one raiding Shaman. One of our priests had to switch to his Shaman because of account issues.<br>

At least we're up to three raiding Paladins with good attendance.</div>

We killed him for our second time last night, and while we've been told it gets easier the more you do it, it felt a whole heckuva lot easier last night than our first kill. We never had problems avoiding the fire (if you can believe it, idiots falling was still wiping us after ~60 attempts), but the fires last night seemed a LOT less problematic, which in turn increased DPS, making fight shorter, etc. etc.<br>
<br>
The fires last night just seemed to be easier. Anyone else notice it?<br>
<br>
Also, you can survive soul charges, and keep going without a problem, so long as no one dies to the soul charge. When someone dies, I'll call out on vent "soul charge incoming," and it's the guild's cue to be ready to bandage immediately. It's definitely recoverable.<br>
<br>
Also, we run 3 shamans now (1 enh, 2 resto) and it makes this fight MUCH better. Tremor Totem really shines here.</div>

</div>I definitely saw this happening on our kill on Wednesday. Only saw it once though, but what happened was that a Doomfire spawned, which I dodged, then it went all the way behind the melee, only to come back at the front of Archimonde and approximately path of the spot it spawned. It despawned instantly, the entire trail, not the start of the trail like before - it was completely gone the moment it ended. Very odd.</div>

</div>[edit: havent done archi post-patch]<br>
<br>
Spreading out does two things:<br>
<br>
Air Burst is an AoE, so more spread = less burst.<br>
<br>
Spreading out means less people in any given area. So if a Doomfire comes to a group 10 people, it's going to be worse than coming to a group of 3.<br>
<br>
<br>
The only downside of spreading out is possible OOR decursers. Not usually an issue though.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
As for the Doomfire, it noticably 'latches' onto and follows people. Not always for its full duration, and may simply drop off you too. It also seems possible to 'break' the latch by dodging it as if you were dodging a rolling boulder, stepping sideways quickly as it approaches. However this is NOT a good thing to do. If you Doomfire is near you, the best thing to do is run it AWAY from the boss in a straight line if possible. Yes you look like an idiot for not simply side-stepping it, but if you side-step it there is the possibility it will loop around and encircle a group of healers / melee / slow people.<br>
<br>
I estimate that the vast majority of wipes could be avoided if people simply handled Doomfire correctly. I dont mean positioning during fears or that sorta stuff, I mean what *you* do as the Doomfire spawns in your vicinity.</div>

		<div id="post_message_493612">Ok archimonde died today after 5 tries, thats whole of 2.5 night of tries post patch but anyway back to meritum. <br>
<br>
I cracked my head a lot during the fight especially about doomfires.<br>
<br>
We tried 2 things about positioning archimonde, killed with 360o degree tactic.  <br>
-360 degree spreading , archi near choped wood<br>
-180 degree spreading in moon shape behind archi which was tanked at the mountain. <br>
<br>
Both had pros and negatives but they are RELATIVE how people handle with doomfire... <br>
If your raid is very good at running doomfire in straight line 180 degree tac is clearly superior. <br>
<br>
How i see doomfire mechanics. <br>
People who are in front of spawning doomfire shall NEVER EVER strafe run but run backwards or else doomfire loops like crazy. U can strafe back into the fight once its quite far so once it loop it wont even reach ranged ppl. <br>
BUT... when we used 180degree tactic few times doomfire was running at the top of the mountain in straight line where nobody ever was so... <br>
<br>
I think there is something other gimmick about doomfire and its not only following people. Key could be analyzing positioning and raid moving when it spawns and from what i've saw it never spawns more than ~15yards from archi, its like doomfire has outer ring running out of archi were it spawns.</div>

We had for the first time 4 shamans and boy was that a big difference. With the Airburst + Grip combo gone, he was easier by a tremendous amount. People were feared for about 2 seconds max.<br>

Just positioned into three camps, decurses+healers at each, all decursers raid iconed up.<br>
<br>
Initial positioning isnt that important as its fluid, the key is moving around well and staying close to one of your decursers as dps/healer.<br>
<br>
With good decursing, the only real issue with the fight is avoiding doomfire+fear combo, we make sure fear CD is announced and people move away from fires, we only had 2 shamans and the only issue we had was the first attempt the guildmaster &gt;.&gt; tried escaping from doomfire...across me ( MT ) and getting me airbursted and consequently finger of deathing people.  <br>

Second attempt was a good clean kill and our guild second ( first was post patch ).<br>

		<div id="post_message_493759">Considering you only have 1 shaman I think I can give you a hint how to possition your groups so it make it a little bit easier for you.<br>
<br>
 4-----------------------1<br>
<br>
<br>
       melee Boss MT<br>
                             <br>
        <br>
 3-----------------------2<br>
What you can do here is basicly split the raid into 5 self sufficient groups each having a decurser + 2 healers + 2dps'ers excluding (melee group which should only consist 1 shaman for tremor totem for the rogues).<br>
<br>
Now lets focus on the ranged groups that we have (1-2-3-4) almost full time you will have fire walls that threaten 2 of those groups by heading to their direction and you have more or less correct timer for the fear. <br>
What you can do is tell to the groups that are on the sides where the fire wall is to move far away exactly before the next fear happens that way you will still have atleast 4 healers + hots on the MT and ofcourse you can make a rotation for (trinket bubble etc.) depending on which groups need to move(good voice comunication will help a lot here).<br>
Talking about cursed ppl it shouldnt be a problem because :<br>
1st every group has its own decurser and melee are decursed by everyone in range<br>
2nd even if someone gets curse + burst (which shouldnt happen now with the patch iirc) he is flying exactly behind the back of his own group which should make it easy for his group decurser to simply turn back run 20 yards in the dirrection of the cursed player and decurse him before he dies.<br>
<br>
The most important thing in this tactic is that people should always move away from the fire before fear happens and you shouldnt be afraid because there are groups that do not have on their side and the healers in those groups can heal the MT without problem.</div>

</div>Similar to the previous poster, we stress staying alive MUCH more than anything else -- including DPS.   We had a kill stopped by the enrage timer, and I was actually very happy with the outcome.    DPS will come as people get more comfortable staying alive.  <br>
<br>
One of the things we do for this fight is just to let the melee bring the kill home for us.  We chain heroism in to that group, and give that shaman our fear ward (if that priest is online).   Melee getting a doomfire will suck up more healing than anything else (especially with the change to the water).   The side benefit is that they do a crapton of damage as well.</div>

</div>Vashj is forgiving provided you can think on your feet.  Nothing that can go wrong really has the ability to wipe the raid on it's own.  Archimonde can be unforgiving if you are unlucky enough to have a soul charge hit the raid right before a fear, leaving no ability to react or recover, and can wipe the raid if multiple people die as a result of it.</div>

		<div id="post_message_503171">Yeah if you learn this fight, the first thing that kills you is probably either airburst, curse or tank taking a spike.<br>
<br>
As soon as you got airburst under control and the curse is being dispelled properly, it may switch to doomfire problems - and that is where it probably remains for the rest until the firstkill. Really drill it into the people, that avoiding fires is paramount to everything else.<br>
<br>
No ranged DD should EVER hit the fire. Ever. A MT healer, that's understandable, but never a ranged DD. Should there be no fear breaker for some ranged DDs, have them run all the way out each time a fire is somewhere near and a fear is coming up. Even if that means that the player is 40 seconds in total not doing any damage at all. Damage for everything not melee is irrelevant, Archimonde requires about 6800 raiddps. You're most likely spiking 17K right at the start. If you don't loop the fires back in circles at the melee, because you're thinking you need to get back for some DPS time, your melee will kill him just fine for you.<br>
<br>
I've probably wiped around 80 times at Archimonde and killed him 3 times. I have never seen the enrage. Damage is irrelevant, survival is all.<br>
<br>

</div>Vashj and kael are more execution based than Archimonde.  You may find archimonde more difficult to repeat than the former due to random elements of doomfire and fear completely governing the difficulty of the fight - no two archimonde attempts are remotely similar, and for some people this is what they enjoy.  <br>
<br>
More Indiana Jones balls need to be rolled through these encounters is probably the thinking.</div>

</div>We've killed archimonde like hmm 11 times now I think and it is by far the hardest fight for us to repeat.  I think most guilds will disagree with me on this, but most guilds don't do Archimonde with 1 shaman <br>
<br>
The degree of repeatability is directly proportional to the amounts of shaman, fear wards, undead you have in your raid, aside from the fear there really isn't any challenging component to the fight, so the more ways you can remove it the easier he will be to farm.</div>

</div>The fear has a minimum timer and a maximum timer. Within that window (about 15 seconds) it can be cast at any time. They've changed most "random" mechanics to work on this semi-random principle, because pure-timed abilities could be considered too easy to work around (as you said, if fear was always 45 seconds you could time it to tick exactly 0.5 seconds after the fear, breaking it semi-instantly).</div>

		<div id="post_message_506312">Just to give you an idea of how repeatable the fight is.. my guild has killed him ~8 times now, we're currently working on Illidan.  This week we 1-shot all of Hyjal except Archimonde, 1-shot Naj, Sup, Akama, Teron, Bloodboil and Mother.  RoS we 2-shot after a double-resist by the felhunters on p2 bubble so I kicked a shield while Spirit Shock was busy shocking our MT.  Next attempt went off without a hitch.  Council was 2-shot, our second kill.  Archimonde took ~7 attempts.<br>
<br>
In our 2 months killing him, we've never failed to down him.  Usually its on the first night of attempts (first few weeks we'd do Rage -&gt; Azgalor night 1, Archi night 2.. now we do full Hyjal night 1 + some BT), occasionally it spills over to a second night of attempts.  We've 1-shot him, we've taken 20+ attempts on him post-first-kill.  Its a pretty random fight but nothing you CAN'T handle.  Granted the MT taking 3x 9k+ hits in 2 seconds does suck.  Just treat it the same every week - SURVIVE and ye shall get loot.</div>

		<div id="post_message_506377">Our guild tried archimonde tonight for the first time and killed him after ~3.5 hours or 15-20 total attempts, with a unlucky 11% wipe in the first part of the night. Ive been dying to do this fight myself for months and only had this thread as a resource to find out what other people think. So finally today I got my chance to experience it and my thoughts on the fight were:<br>
<br>
- the fight itself is amazingly FUN and original!  Concentration and communication required all the time!<br>
<br>
- the fight would have been extraordinarily frustrating before the changes to airburst/fear and we're glad we got to him at a time where this was much less random<br>
<br>
- doomfires were very controllable with good positioning and communcation<br>
<br>
- we used 3 shamans and 5 decursers and a 4-point square formation for basic setup (4 mages in a square formation around archimonde at the centre, with all their group standing on them - and a resto druid standing in the middle of the square with the melee, responsible for melee decurse)<br>
<br>
Fun sidenote is: most of our mage/caster dps were on ~300-600 dps and for the kill of 8.5 minutes I (also mage) did about the same damage as the main tank! Leave the real damage to your melee, wear good sta/pvp gear instead and forget about trying to do damage like normal fights.<br>
<br>
I havent been this impressed with a raiding encounter since C'thun - totally in love with this fight and really commend blizzard with its design.</div>

		<div id="post_message_506571">It's nice that you are enthusiastic about your kill and congratulations for that, but I think you are overreacting. Apart from soul charge, nothing is really original about the fight. Also, you will have to do it someday without stacking the raid on decursers/wards/shamans so much and it won't be too enjoyable then propably. I dunno though, maybe I am bitter due to all the disconnect/midair grip wipes we have had. Even now that we usually kill him without much trouble I hate the fight with passion. C'thun and Kael and Illidan and RoS are very different, you can have tangible progress every attempt, while archimonde was just a dice roll every attempt, not because his abilities are random, but the focus and attention span of your raiders each different day is. <br>
<br>
But I sincerely dislike a fight where your odds of defeating it are increasing by using arena gear, and taking strolls around the lake miles away from him. Illidan and Kael are much better and interesting encounters in almost every possible way, you can't overemphasize on any aspect of your gear and beat them.</div>

</div>I would have to disagree entirely. Having an end boss of a zone where survivability is that important raid-wide and dps becomes almost meaningless in comparison - is very original in this implementation (a huge open field where your thrown around and having to run large distances from doomfire). <br>
<br>
Ive never really had that feeling on Kael/Cthun/Ragnaros/Nefarian/Naxx/Vashj before as a mage. C'thun and Kael are both two very awesome other fights, but its just a nice refreshing change and id love to see similar themed fights (encouraging survivability over everything else) in future.<br>
<br>
Even if some mechanics of the fight might not be new (eg: fear, running away from something bad) the way it all comes together in the fight is what does it. Having 3 shamans and 4-5 decursers (3 mage + 1resto and  feral druid helping) isnt what id consider raid stacking. Its just a balanced raid comp - and I think requiring a balanced raid comp is fine.<br>
<br>
We did a quick poll of 'What would you rate archimonde out of 10' to guildies after our kill - and no surprise that the melee and main tank rated him the lowest, whereas most of the ranged dps and healers rated him high. <br>
<br>
It really is interesting to see how polarizing the 'Do you like the archimonde fight?" question is between different people/classes/guilds etc.<br>
<br>
During the -10% zerg I took this very cool screenshot:<br>

		<div id="post_message_508694">The Soul Charges are significant and important new ability in a fight as it forces a successful kill to involve very few deaths from the raid.  I guess this would be your basic raid awareness from each individual test taken to a whole new level of importance.  It took my guild roughly three full nights and ~80 attempts before people fully understood how important staying alive for this fight is and we killed him last night.  <br>
<br>
We had 2 shamans, 4 decursers, and 2 dwarf shadow priests out of shadow form to deal with Archimonde's abilities, so our margins for error in positioning relative to Doomfire was fairly tight.  I tried to dps on this fight, but seeing that we only had seven healers available last night, I swapped in more healing and pvp gear and tried to spot heal Doomfire people more than doing damage, while running around fear warding healers.  <br>
<br>
Not too sure how well we will be able to repeat the kill, but I think a large majority of the guild was starting to understand their roles a lot better for the fight by the end of the night.</div>

</div>Grats on the kill.  You really shouldn't judge a fight by 1 kill though, that is pretty short sighted.  Kill him 10+ times and we'll see just how much you still enjoy it.

Seeing as we usually have one shaman and 5 decurses is considered a luxury, it does get hairy in some attempts. I'm not sure though, even though we're not running flasked yet(what's the point if we're trying to survive), DPS does seem to be fairly low. Or is it just *that* dependant on lucky doomfires, that will allow to quickly catch on? Also, we're fairly melee light recently, I'd assume that makes a difference as well.</div>

</div>That just means the level of concentration, co-ordination and strong balanced raid comp (decursers, shamans, fear management techniques) is going to need to remain strong for every kill - unlike other farm bosses which just progressively get easier as your gear gets better, even if players get lazier and sloppy in performance and execution of the strat. I dont see how this is inherantly 'bad design'. Sure - it might be frustrating and annoying at times, but overall its nice to have one boss in the game like this.<br>

</div>We only took 5 melee (excluding the main tank) to archimonde: 3 rogues + fury warrior + enhancement shaman (group tremor totem) in one group. On our kill those five melee did 51% of <b>total </b>damage to archimonde. <br>
<br>
The other 50% came from the remaining 10 ranged dps. We just pushed the mentality to all ranged/casters that 'leave the dps to the melee, just focus on staying alive' Again this is nothing new, everyone else has said it previously in this thread - but its really what needs to be nailed into people.</div>

</div>We've killed Archimonde four times now and Mother Shahraz three, but I'd dare say Shahraz is more annoying to repeat once you learn the fights. Like the poster above said, Archimonde becomes easier once your players become accustomed to focusing on survival, whereas Shahraz can be pain in the ass just because some things aren't controllable like how many mana burn beams you happen to get or bad attraction ports. Last reset on Shahraz on one try our healers we running OOM around 30% due to constant mana burn which of course meant that people started dying. Try or two later, when we got the kill we had better luck with beams so she died with only one player dead.</div>

</div>We got him down five or six times now (with four healing staves btw...) and our last kill was really bad. On one try I think we had 3 deaths (one 2 second silence, once that 50% more damage thing and once the dot) but just pushed through. It's not that hard if you just don't give up (we only got him down to 3x% that try, but that was because after we had gotten throuh all thoughs charges ~7 people got DF at the same time on the same side and due to massive healing needs the MT died).</div>

Large problems arise when people who are being followed by doomfire, decide to move in an arc around Archimonde instead of just running backwards.

		<div id="post_message_511865">Heres a test picture I made before we killed archimonde, when we were discussing positioning. Every guild uses different strats for group setup and positioning, as u can see we opted for a 4 point square around archimonde (group 5 is the melee group). This is what worked best for us - it may or may not work for your guild.<br>
<br>
The trick is:  <br>
<br>
- when doomfire spawns that <b>whole group</b>  runs in a <b>straight </b>line away from the boss <b>as far as possible</b> until the doomfire stops following you. Dont stop, dont try to sidestep it - the entire group keeps running in a straight line away as far as you can.<br>
<br>
- each group is a fully self-sufficient unit - with its own healers and a decurser with a symbol.  You always stay together: therefore you all get airbusted together (so nobody is ever out of range of their healer/decurser) and you <b>ALL </b>move together when a doomfire comes towards your group, regardless of which person in the group its actually following. Standing with your group is very high priority, so after any fears or situations where your positions get forcibly changed - moving back to your group decurser symbol is top priority.<br>
<br>
This means that, even if the doomfire turns around and comes back for melee, by the time its back it will almost be close to despawning because it has a large travel time to 'snake back' before it reaches the melee. With good vent communication you will be able to alert your melee well in advance if this is happening so they can run off.<br>
<br>
It almost always spawns (in my observations) and heads immediately outwards towards the closest ranged/healers for 10-15 seconds before theres a chance it will 'loop around' and chase melee. That 10-15 seconds is crucial as its the time you want to get it to move as far away (in that straight line) from the boss as you can.<br>

</div>Maybe I'm just unaware, but I've never had to kite a Doomfire.  The ranged in our guild do, but melee just tend to stand and dps.  If a doomfire is headed to melee, we move step back or to the side a bit as it passes through.  If we get bursted and can't get back, we wait.  Nothing special really.</div>

Something interesting to note is that we had a GM watch us on our last attempt of the night so that he could see if it was a bug.

		<div id="post_message_513384">Has anyone ever tried having the majority of people stand in melee range for this fight?<br>
<br>
My guild had about 4 hours on him last night and we only really got him to 59%.  Most of the deaths were from random screw-ups...such as someone not getting decursed, falling from the air burst, ranged dps getting hit by the fire...etc...etc.<br>
<br>
From what we noticed, the doomfire hardly ever went into the melee group as long as the ranged people around them only ran backwards.  We even started sticking a few MT healers in with the melee, and it worked pretty well.  It also seemed that the ranged people behind the melee (we were using the 4 groups method) would get the majority of the doomfires on their side.  <br>
<br>
I was thinking of everyone stack in 2 groups in melee range except for the mages that would stand at their max range.  The mages could decurse themselves and run away from the fire when it came to them.<br>
<br>
This strat would cause airburst to be a much bigger issue, but i'm wondering if it could be used to mitigate the doomfire...which seems to be our biggest problem when we actually have a good attempt.  <br>
<br>
Any thoughts?</div>

</div>My thoughts are, it sounds like a terrible idea, but it might work for you <br>
<br>
That's a "put all your eggs in 1 basket" strategy. One bad doomfire and you lose. Making everyone take an air burst every single time seems excessive and will probably result in your tank dying due to your healers flying away.<br>
<br>
If people are dying to falling and not being decursed then it just sounds like everyone in your group isn't quite comfortable with the fight. It took us over 60 attempts to kill him once. After that we haven't taken more than 5 I think. Eventually it will all just click for everyone. It's not a DPS race, it's a survival fight. Don't die&gt;You win. It's pretty much that simple. If that means your shadow priests with doomfire shift out of shadowform and heal themselves, so be it. If that means your OOM caster pops a health pot instead of a mana pot to stay alive, so be it. If that means one of your healers runs the entire way to the well and jumps in to avoid doomfire, so be it. That's really all there is to it.</div>

</div>Well it's more of a 2 baskest strategy =p<br>
<br>
But that's assuming you can stand in melee range and be 13 yard away from both the MT and another melee group.   We would split the healers between the 2 melee groups of course.</div>

</div>Agreed, it might work for your guild - but it isnt a very good idea. If you go with the pic I posted a few posts up, each range group consists of: 2 healers + 1 decurser + 2 dps. Each group stands on top of each other so they all get airbusted together and forms a fully self-contained unit which can keep itself alive.<br>
<br>
The points I stressed the hardest besides the obvious one (survival) to the raid on our learning attempts were:<br>
<br>
- Always stand on, and follow if necessary, your group decurser<br>
<br>
- If a doomfire spawns in front of your group, stop <i>immediately </i>and run. Dont stand there and hope it might go in another direction - run first - and look back later to see if its safe to return.<br>
<br>
Raid leaders will notice alot of good healers and dps have a 'must get top healing/damage' mentality and it really needs to be put aside for this fight as people might take dangerous risks to achieve this.<br>
<br>
Risks like 'Ill finish off that last bomb heal before I move from that doomfire heading my way' , or 'ill finish off that fireball when theres a fear in 5 seconds and that doomfire is only 15 yards away', or 'ill just stand here by myself, away from my decurser , so I can dps/heal more'. Those risks are what kill people and will wipe raids.</div>

		<div id="post_message_513541">We're using your strat almost exactly tyrian.  The ranged dps is split to the north and south sides, the melee fights on the west side, and the tank is on the east side.  We have healers on all 4 sides as well.  <br>

I think another one of our biggest problems is that when 1 person went down, I think everyone felt like it was a wipe and I'm not sure they tried to recover.  I know some of them are pretty nasty to recover from, but completly doable as long as 2 people don't die back to back.  How many people go down on a normal kill?

		<div id="post_message_513576">It is also a good idea to use a single resto druid standing on the melee , in the centre of the star formation. I did that and was happy with the result. This druid is primarily responsible for decursing MT/melee (because mages often have to run off and are too far from melee to save them) and hotting up everything hes in range of - raid and MT - since hes at the centre of the star. He will also get airbusted with melee every time and can heal them up through that damage.<br>
<br>
Because your resto druid is probably not in the melee group (and might not have access to the shaman tremor totem) , we gave ours a fear ward for the entire night. Doomfires surround the melee most of the fight and the FW/tremor totem is very helpful. To relate this back to my pic, we use 9 pure healers. Two are on each of the 4 points of the star and the 9th one is the druid in the middle.<br>

</div>If you use vent, the moment someone dies the most important thing is: everyone needs to STFU and relax.<br>
<br>
The raid leader can then calmy tell everyone 'A soul charge is incoming, top everyone up, DPS prepare to healthstone/bandage/pot'.  Although each soul charge has a high chance of killing someone new (and thus causing a wipe chain), raid members still have a responsibility to try minimise the after-effects, through healthstones and pots/bandages, to reduce the massive strain on the healers.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">It was never a raidwide finger... for example, on one of our attempts tonight ~80% he just turned and cast finger on the resto druid in the raid, then turned back to the main tank and kept chugging along.  It was never even timed with punts or grips or anything, and was definitely not from pulling aggro (at least in that case).<br>
<br>
Something interesting to note is that we had a GM watch us on our last attempt of the night so that he could see if it was a bug.  Granted we ended up wiping, but during the wipe Archimonde fingered a random caster in the raid even though the tank and all melee dps were still on him.  The GM's first response was, whoa that's not supposed to happen.<br>

Has anyone had any problems with Archimonde randomly finger of death'ing people for no apparent reason?  We've had it happen a few times when our MT (warrior) was in, but more noticeably tonight the last two attempts in a row (beartank) he's finger of deathed at random times -- once at 70% and the next attempt at like 98%.  Both times the tank was standing still and melee DPS was in.. Archimonde just randomly turned and deathed someone.<br>
<br>
Are we doing something wrong, or is Archimonde bugging out or something?  It's getting pretty frustrating :\</div>

	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>A few weeks ago, we had a DPS Warrior lag out.  When he logged back into the fight (hadn't died), Archimonde did a Finger of Death on a Paladin.  Same situation, tank was in melee range, nothing special going on.  We figured it was from the lag out and just forbid people from logging back in and haven't seen it since.  It could just as easily be a coincidence.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">The trick is:  when doomfire spawns that <b>whole group</b>  runs in a <b>straight </b>line away from the boss <b>as far as possible</b> until the doomfire stops following you.

</div>We had killed Archimonde once with a triangular configuration but had way too many deaths from doomfires.  We moved to this configuration and what happened was more running _away_ because you could afford to have an entire group or two out of range if healers were spread out equally.  Also, and I think this was really key, is it makes it possible for groups to police themselves as opposed to letting people get by doing stupid things and get by with it because no one was really watching them.  As a raid leader it was possible to just ask people in group if someone was eating a dubious number of doomfires, if they were playing poorly, and then ask people to reinforce good decision making on Archimonde. The doomfires/attempts ratio per person in raid went down a stunning amount.<br>
<br>
So it was like 1-50 kill/wipe with me trying to call out when someone was doing something dumb in a triangular configuration to now we're at 2-12.<br>
<br>
I really didn't like learning Archimonde as I felt like it forced leadership into a more disciplinarian kind of role that, even though I know it's what's required on this fight and I wasn't calling people out on trivial things, still made me feel like an ass.  So I'm much more a fan of a group-based approach to solving that problem.</div>

</div>Better not to use those potions imho . Not 100% if it has been mentioned before , but promoting your decursers so they can put/refresh their raid icons , and people trying to reach out those helps i think(after doing with 3 decursers). Certainly is an annoying fight though </div>

</div>Sorry - but this is wrong. There is no 'luck' involved if somebody is out of range of a decurse - its your strategy at fault.  Its a weakness of the 'everyone just spread out around archimonde' strategy.<br>
<br>
The <b>only </b> way ive seen people die to Grip in our proper attempts is when they break our number 1 rule. That rule is: stay with your decurser!. Our decursers are the 'leaders' of each group. They have a symbol and control the movement and direction you will run from doomfires - and you must always follow them - so if theres an airbust, you will get airbusted with them - so range should never be an issue.<br>

</div>Deadlybossmods by default puts a Skull symbol on people who get airbust - and unfortunately this overwrites any current symbols the raid has placed on that person. However there is an option to turn it off . Turn that option off and set symbols on mages/druids and they shouldnt get over-written again.</div>

There should never be any decurse-range issues, ever.</div>

</div>I disagree. Way I see it is this:<br>
<br>
<b>Staying with group and getting airbusted together pros</b><br>
- Always in range of group decurser<br>
- Always in range of group healer<br>
- Players focus on their group only (5 people)<br>
<br>
cons<br>
- A couple more people take 3k damage oin the airbust<br>
<br>
<b>Spreading entire raid out pros</b><br>
- less people take air bust damage<br>
<br>
cons<br>
- Potential for people to get airbusted out of range of healers<br>
- Potential for people to get airbusted out of range of decursers<br>
- Players need to watch more of the raid (at the expense of focusing on your surival and that of your group only), since alot of decursing/healing might be required out-of-group.<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
Its personal preference as both strategy's can work just fine - however I think several small groups is superior. I would gladly have a few extra people take a negligable 3k airbust damage than risk having players get separated from healers/decursers.</div>

		<div id="post_message_517160">We've killed him 3 times now and have always used the triangular approach. With this method we've found that the greatest success comes from having each group back up if any fire comes near them and clear the area until the flames are gone. Usually what would end up happening is if the fire converged on either of the sides (sometimes both) the 2 groups on either side would merge into the middle group and everyone would be stacked. Then if a fire got in the middle multiple people would be hit, as well as having a ton of people getting air burst at once. So having that group back up and just relax for a moment definately helps cut down on crowding. We still end up getting Archimonde to 10% with 4 minutes left on the enrage timer. We run with 4-5 shamans, 4-5 decursers as well as 7-8 healers depending on the day. Yesterday we had 3 dwarf priests in the group and had the entire raid fear warded for the first fear.. was pretty hax.<br>
<br>
I agree with one of the posters that you definately have to do a lot of yelling during this raid. Mainly to point out mistakes and make sure that other people don't repeat the same ones. Even though I really hate this fight on a personal level, I like that it really causes everyone to focus and bring their A game. No matter what we do after Archimonde that day it always seems so much easier. That fight is a great way to train people to communicate, improve situational awareness and focuses on individual performance.</div>

</div>We use the 4 corners + melee group technique and have had maybe 20 attempts (NOT including things like 100% wipes on the pull etc =), we only had 5-6hrs on him so far. Our best was 13%, 2 other pulls were sub 25% and 2 more were sub 35%.<br>
<br>
However we learned that progress on this fight is NOT measured by each pull getting him lower and lower in hp. Simply due to the randomness that you can counteract to only SOME degree, your 20% wipe could easily be followed by a 65% wipe then to get a 15% wipe and then a 70% wipe.<br>
<br>
Wipes were almost always caused by doomfire spawning and immediately arcing into the melee group, causing too much stress for healers.  Our best attempts have been when people have remained completely calm, even if a soulcharge goes off. Our 13% wipe included 2 soul charges.<br>
<br>
If you are struggling with 3 groups, split it into 4 + melee and see how it goes, we raid mark all our decursers and put 1 in each group, then everyone in that group knows they must always try to be next to their groups raid mark. Also, I as a feral druid Decurse as much as I am able to. I recently got Decursive, which I found to be great for this, just left click on a box that shows a cursed player in range and they are decursed. Very simple to use.<br>
<br>
This fight is 100% about survival, if people can do something to help, they should help. Decursing a person 1 second faster than a mage means that person might take a bit less damage and that can make a huge difference in the long run. As a feral I shift, decurse, and instant regrowth, it means I chug mana pots, but survival is key here, people need to do what they can.<br>
<br>
Also, do not forget the fight doesn't really change until he is dead (or 10% from what I have read, but thats as good as dead =). There is next to no difference between the fight at 70% than the fight at 20%. People just need to get used to what to do and to survive as best they can, as long as they can.</div>

</div>Ultimately its personal preference - and dependant on what <i>your </i> guilds players are better suited for.<br>
<br>
As another posted already said: a key benefit of 4-corner setup is you can introduce a very strict 'keep your group alive' mentality - and hold people acccountable to that. Group healers and decursers know that if someone in their group is cursed/damaged, <u>they </u>must handle it - or answer to the raid leader what went wrong if they die.<br>
<br>
If you ask players to just focus on small group survival (as opposed to 'spread out around archimonde and watch the whole raid), people will end up noticing alot more of whats going on that concerns <i>that group</i>.  Yes, its ironic that if you ask people to focus on less - they may actually notice more.</div>

		<div id="post_message_521537">One thing I wondered about the 4 corners thing is obviously all 8 healers are responsible for the MT. But my question is how many of the groups need to be in range of the MT and melee to specifically keep the MT up? Would one group and 2 healers be enough for a few seconds if doomfire forces the other 3 away? Or would 2 be needed? I think for many (especially healers) its instinctual to look after the safety of the MT instead of your own. Which means when fires come their way they are not too quick to get out of dodge and just run the hell away, which leads to people dying prematurely. I know Archi doesn't hit as hard as Azgalor, but I think 2 healers should be enough to keep him up for a few seconds.<br>
<br>
Has anyone found out that having a group leader for each ranged group maybe with a macro hotkeyed saying something like "group 1 is retreating from doomfire and are OOR" would be useful for the raid as a whole, so other groups can step up to fill the responsibility?</div>

		<div id="post_message_521541">It's also very important that your 'group leader' (we symbol one person in each of the non-melee groups for everyone to follow) be very aware of each doomfire, where it's heading, how long it's been up, incoming fears etc.. Ideally, this person is also the group decurser, but it's better to have a player that can handle these tasks. <br>
<br>
For example, using the 'run straight out' approach is fine in theory, but there are a few exceptions in terms of running back IN that you just can't teach. The doomfire is a random element that is vastly different from one attempt to another. The group leader needs to be able to go 'ok, that first one we ran away from looped away a little bit, but it could come back.. think we'll stay run back slightly a little longer... oh shit another doomfire on our side, run out.. run back near the 1st one since it's about to despawn' etc.. <br>
<br>
Running 'straight out' and running 'straight back' is a good base, but there's some exceptions to this. If people are TOO scared of the fire, and run TOO far back (once you are like 100yds out, you can start looping the fire around, since it won't make it back towards melee at that point anyways, just be careful not to cut yourselves off) then you can occasionally run into having too many decursers/healers out of range and some melee or the MT bites it.</div>

</div>If you attempted this your raid screen would be spammed with messages - people dont have time to read the amount of 'im coming' or 'we are moving' messages this would create - it would only serve as an un-necessary distraction in an otherwise busy fight. As long as healers realise that one second 8 healers might be on mt and a few seconds later only 3 (the rest suddenly might have to run from doomfire/airbust) it should be enough.<br>
<br>
<br>
Agree with the above poster, the group leader of each group should be watching the doomfires intensely, as much of their groups survival depending on them. They should know which doomfires will despawn first and when its safe to move to any given position. <br>
<br>
From memory a doomfire max travel distance, assuming it moves in a straight line, is roughly from where Archimonde stands to the well of eternity and maybe 1/3 the way back again. Id guess thats about 100-130 yards? So if you manage to pull the doomfire ~X yards away from Archimonde on the run-out, you can guess how far it will follow you on the run in, given that you know roughly what its max travel distance is. <br>
<br>
So yea you could run ~70 yards out, turn around, and know it'll despawn by the time you return to your original position - but wouldnt suggest trying this while you learn the fight. Stick to the 'run out as far as possible' motto while you learn it.<br>

</div>After racking my brain, I struggle to think of any times where our MT died because of 'lack of healing' with the 4pt method over several dozen attempts. Tank deaths were almost always the result of parrys or soul charges from other people.  It shouldnt really be a problem.  <br>
<br>
Now to get slightly off on a tangent.... The problem arises when lots of people get doomfire and too many heals have to be diverted off the MT to keeping the raid alive through the doomfire, which means.... <br>
<br>
MT healing is a group effort from the entire raid, even the nonhealers  - because - the more proactive people are in avoiding doomfires, the more the healing can be focused solely on the MT - and the lower your chance of him dying will be. I repeated this on vent several times on our first learning night:  "Every heal for someone with doomfire, is a heal thats <b>not</b> on the main tank."  Thats really what it comes down to . I had some raid members comment how 'doomfire doesnt tick for much' as a justifcation for why its 'no big deal' if you get doomfire. Thats the wrong attitude - its not you that we're worried about, its the loss of healing from the MT thats of concern.<br>
<br>
So I guess my point is, you cant really just talk about healers when it comes to 'Main tank healing on archimonde' . Thats only half the story: the other half is minimising healing lost off the MT to doomfires - and thats a raidwide responsibility. Both need to be considered and dps made aware they have a large part to play in the MTs survival too.</div>

</div>Well, I would say that making it to 10% with enough DPS alive to be able to DPS him down  in 1minute is the whole fight.<br>
<br>
However it is not like they possibly could have done that on purpose, so yes, you cheaped that kill, but to get that far you will clearly be killing him the next reset legitimately, so I wouldn't lose any sleep over it at all =).<br>
<br>
Myself, we still have trouble with Doomfire (and Azgalor =). The main problem is that it spawns, and immediately curves into melee giving them little to no time to react to it, invariably when this happens every non rogue gets the debuff which stresses healers greatly, and though we have recovered from this and wiped due to other reasons, it has definately been the single cause of most of our wipes.</div>

</div>I have <i>never </i>seen this happen. Could you elaborate on your positioning for the raid? Where do range/healers stand? How many groups and where? Are you using semi-circle, 'spread out anywhere', triangular or 4-corners positioning techniques?<br>
<br>
I still have only ever seen doomfires spawn and move outwards towards the closest range/healing groups for a while before there is a chance it'll start to change direction. I dont recall seeing a doomfire spawn and immediately head backwards to melee , without first heading outwards for some period. They most certainly can (and will) loop back around , but not for a while.  Because im a mage and also my group decurser - I spend most of the fight carefully watching the movement of the doomfires - I find it a little strange ive never noticed what you describe, heres what I usually see:<br>
<br>
X = Ranged/Healer group<br>
O = Doomfire spawn points<br>
<br>
X1------------X2<br>
------------------<br>
---O1-----O2---<br>
-----BOSS------<br>
---O3-----O4---<br>
-----------------<br>
X3-----------x4<br>
<br>
In my experience a doomfire will almost always head outwards towards the closest X number first. For example: Ive never seen a 'O3' spawn-point doomfire head towards X2 upon spawning, it would head towards X3 first. It could also head towards X4 if they are too far left, or X1 if they move too far south. However, with correct positioning like in the diagram, all the doomfires seem to reliably move towards their corresponding numbered X when they spawn.</div>

		<div id="post_message_522321">Some people were asking me about possible ways to handle decursing/healing setup for a 4-point method and heres quick pic I made to visually show it:<br>
<br>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304075054im_/http://img148.imageshack.us/img148/7541/archsetupxh3.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<br>
You could indeed cut out the 9th healer in the middle and run with 8, but I think this creates an unnecessary risk. <br>
<br>
You cant rely on the range groups to decurse the middle always, as theres a chance they might all be far away: running from doomfires/getting airbusted. The central druid , with permenant hots for the MT, swiftmend for emergencies, ability to decurse all melee/mt in the absence of mages who need to run off, and ability to heal multiple melee with doomfire with OP hots - is a nice way to play it safe.<br>
<br>
Because your healing druid is in melee range with doomfires nearby, id recommend giving him fear wards first (if possible). Some guilds might not have those, so putting him in the tremor totem melee group might be another option.<br>
<br>
I just dont like the idea of having all melee/mt helplessly sit there with the only decursers/healers  standing 30+ yards away who might have to run/airbusted 100+yards any moment and unable to help them. You could say 'range groups watch melee' but I think the best results with the 4 point strat are when you <b>know</b> who is responsible for certain people and you can hold them accountable or they die. Assuming your healers and decursers are on the ball, its almost always the dead player who did something stupid. (eg: ran too far from their decurser and got Gripped, stood too close to a doomfire with a fear incoming)<br>
<br>
If a melee dies - your first question should be to the central druid - because the druid was right next to them and should have seen/noticed exactly what happened. Asking 4 mages what happened, who might be 100 yards away or busy decursing their own group - might yield an answer like 'I didnt see' or 'I dont know'- and thats not good enough. Somebody always needs to see/know exactly what happened.<br>
<br>
Its the same with every other aspect of the fight. If somebody dies from a curse - ask that groups decurser what happened. If a range dps dies from doomfire, ask that groups healer why they died. If a healer dies from doomfire, ask that groups DPS whether the healer was standing too close to it. There should always be someone to ask, 'How did XXX die' when something goes wrong that can give you a solid answer.<br>

</div>Good find.  The time where the doomfire is 'stuck' and stationary is very bad - and could be responsible for the problems you describe. <br>
<br>
Blocking a doomfire off only 20 yards from its spawn point at the stump (if the boss is tanked close to it), might mean it'll turn around to melee with 80+ yards left of travel distance before it will despawn - and just go through the entire raid wreaking havoc.<br>
<br>
Ideally, the doomfire needs to head 50-70 yards directly outwards from Archimonde, unrestricted by terrain - before your melee can consider it 'safe' (aka Whereby it would despawn by the time it reached them if it turned around)</div>

</div>We had problems with this boss after 2 kills, and we switched to a similar positioning.  The fires always move towards a group upon spawning, and that group runs away from the fire.  I have no idea what the range is, but the fires never curve towards another group once you get them a certain distance from other people.  The other benefit of this strat is that groups get air bursted together and can decurse and heal after landing with no problems.<br>
<br>
In 5 attempts using this "have your group run straight away from the boss when fires spawn" strat, we only had someone die to doomfire twice, and one was just a stupid mistake and the other was a disconnect.  Our other two wipes were due to the MT dying while more than one group was avoiding fires.  We simply adjusted healing and got a kill.<br>
<br>
Our raid leader looked at fraps, and the only times we had fires streaking through the middle was when someone ran in a stupid place while the fire was following them.  The  fires follow a player 100% of the time, so it's easily possible to control the fires.</div>

		<div id="post_message_524116">We use a 5-point strategy.  Generally we run this fight with 4 shaman, and the 5th group (my group "stump hump") positions themselves near the stump.  With the proper mentality of "group survival first", a little jumping experience, and some awareness this group becomes self sufficient and doesn't require a tremor.  We still do moderate amount of healing/decursing for the rest of the raid, but always focus on the group first (the other groups can handle themselves just fine).  <br>
<br>
While I don't think we are the most effective group (in terms of killing the boss), this is one of the most entertaining groups to be in on any encounter.  I'm ret for all of our raids, and genuinely enjoy swapping to heal gear for this fight.<br>
<br>
If you're getting a little bored, I highly recommend this   <br>
<br>
STUMP HUMP!<br>
<br>
<br>
Edit: For those confused, the stump offers some advantages during fear.  However, it's also a huge risk if people don't understand the mechanics.  The whole group can die in a few seconds if you don't know what you're doing.  If you are short a shaman, I recommend this.  Feel free to PM me if you are interested in learning more about stump hump.</div>

Im guessing 'stump hump' refers to wedging yourself somewhere in the stump/branch on the right such that over half/threequarters direction of your movement is blocked if your feared? Thus you indirectly have some degree of control over which direction you will get feared.<br>
<br>
I can definetely see the advantages of doing this, but like you said, it requires some degree of skill from the players of knowing when its safe to trap yourself like that. It could result in alot of very funny, stupid deaths too - lol.</div>

</div>You have the basic idea.  The right stump (in you picture) will prevent you from moving off of the stump (there is no "path" off of it).  Following simple fear mechanics, fear will never run you off a cliff or down/up a "path" that cannot be normally climbed up.  <br>
<br>
It's safe to stand on the stump when a fear is about to hit.  For the most part we all stay on it during the entire fight.  We get air burst together, we run back together, etc.  The *very* dangerous part is when a doomfire comes very close and "touches" part of the stump.  If a fear hits at this point anyone on the stump gets rapidly tosses in and out of the doomfire, instantly reapplying the 2400 fire damage.  An entire group can die in a matter of seconds.<br>
<br>
So, you just need to make sure the group is ready to abandon stump should a doomfire come in contact with the stump.  Again, the graphic won't show, so you just have to watch the  path of the fire.  I'll try to make a fraps next week.<br>
<br>
Our ventrilo is often spammed with messages like:<br>
<br>
"Abandon stump!"<br>
"Stump hump, reassemble!"<br>
"Humpers, regroup!"<br>
<br>
It makes it all the more exciting.<br>
<br>
<br>
One conversation we avoid (if we all get caught on the stump during a doomfire...), Archimonde Soulcharge +5!!!<br>
<br>
"What happened to G1?"<br>
"We don't want to talk about it."<br>
<br>
<br>
Certain objects are ignored during fear</div>

All we had to change was removing a couple people who were far too prone to "problems," and adding shaman. Seriously, I read earlier that the fight with more shaman was like night and day, and we went from at most 1 shaman to 5, and the fight is laughably different. Trivialized, arguably. We went 10 healers as well, and had no problem with the enrage timer. Seems very repeatable, which makes me very happy after the pain of learning with 0-1 shaman.</div>

</div>We had a similar experience never having more then 2 shaman.  We even tried the group method but still no kill. Finally we decided to give in and bring in more shaman.  So we had some friends of the guild reroll shaman, power leveled them, rushed them through attunements and rolled in with 5 shaman.  Arch died in 4 tries with that setup.  Since all our wipes consisted of someone dying from doomfire + airburst or doomfire + grip and most of the doomfire came from fears this almost completely got rid of our doomfires.  Which of course ment a kill.</div>

		<div id="post_message_529404">Curious if any guilds tried to go wear shadow resist for the fight to help negate the fears.<br>
<br>
Looks to me that the DPS requirement for the fight isn't much of a factor so why not wear some quality shadow resist gear?  Maybe 150 unbuffed + Prayer of Shadow Protection + Mark could help?<br>
<br>
I do like the idea of using the Square/4-Group positioning around the MT + Melee.  <br>
<br>
I'm thinking that groups that do not have a Shaman for Tremor Totem could benefit from wearing Shadow Resist.<br>

		<div id="post_message_530678">Couple questions I have here about this fight.<br>
<br>
We use the 4 corners method, but have had issues sustaining the fight past 3 minutes in our 2 nights of attempts. Seems dps is okay, since we get him to about 70% in that 3 minutes, but still usually someone dies and then it spirals out of control.<br>
<br>
1) When dealing with doomfire, if a doomfire goes toward a group is it necessary for the whole group to run away? Or just part of it? This along with my next question is the tricky part of the encounter. I know when doomfire goes toward you that you're supposed to run. But then sometimes you go one way and it goes slightly another and the thing is is it safe to move back in yet? Issue with whole groups running away cause of doomfire has been our tank being killed due to things like 2 groups running away, 1 being air burst and the 4th couldn't do it alone.<br>
<br>
2) When is it safe to move back in after doomfire? First night I did this I ran the hell away and stayed out til I knew it was safe to move back in. Obviously this killed my dps. Second night I mostly did that, but then I tried moving back in once on a doomfire I thought had latched on to someone else and passed me and I got hit from behind when it switched to me and looped back in upon me. This really ties into question 1 because I'm not sure if doomfire kiting should be done with individuals or with whole groups sticking together.</div>

				This along with my next question is the tricky part of the encounter. I know when doomfire goes toward you that you're supposed to run. But then sometimes you go one way and it goes slightly another and the thing is is it safe to move back in yet? Issue with whole groups running away cause of doomfire has been our tank being killed due to things like 2 groups running away, 1 being air burst and the 4th couldn't do it alone. When is it safe to move back in after doomfire?[/

</div>This is part of the fight where you simply have to experience it and learn yourself. However there are essentially two types of doomfires in the strat. If you look at a doomfire you should be able to tell what type it is and whether its safe to return to your location immediately, whether you should wait a few seconds just in case - or whether you should wait until the doomfire despawns completely. Heres two examples:<br>
<br>
<b>Good Doomfires</b><br>
<br>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302212110im_/http://img65.imageshack.us/img65/9242/safedoomfire2zi5.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<br>
 A doomfire that spawns at archimonde and heads a long way (eg 80 yards) directly outwards. This is a safe doomfire . Even it decides to turn around it should be despawning by the time it reaches any other groups or your melee. Therefore if the doomfire stops following you at 80 yards away you can simply run back in to the boss and happily DPS - because you know that even if it changed direction to come for you - it will be despawning by the time it reaches you.<br>
<br>
<b>Bad Doomfires </b><br>
<br>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302212110im_/http://img222.imageshack.us/img222/352/baddoomfirecr6.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<br>
A doomfire that spawns next to Archimonde and begins to turn around/arc after a short distance (eg 30 yards) is extremely dangerous and you need to watch its movement very closely - as theres over 100+ yards left of travel distance on it before it despawns.<br>
<br>
In the above pic the arrow shows where this doomfire suddenly becomes dangerous. You dont know which direction it will go and its got alot of travel time left before it despawns. Even if it appears to go in another direction , its probably safer to just stay away until it despawns. Even if you stood 50 yards from it - it could easily reach you before it despawns.  <br>
<br>
This is a good example of a doomfire where you need to say on vent immediately 'Melee watch out , possible doomfire coming from behind'.<br>

	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>The <i>whole </i>group moves away immediately, irrespective of which actual person in the group its actually following.  This is the key part of the 4-point group strat. If one person has to move - the whole group moves.<br>

		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>Ill try to explain clearly why you made a terrible decision here.<br>
<br>
1 -  If you had stayed with your group and moved with them, that doomfire would <b>still </b> be heading directly outwards. <br>
<br>
2 - If it was still heading outwards, it would be keep moving further from the rest of the raid (20 people) and become a safe doomfire like in an above picture. However because you chose to DPS you turned that doomfire around and suddenly it comes dangerously close to the raid again. <br>
<br>
3 - Because the doomfire is now close to the raid/other groups (after turning around to follow you), you might force other groups/melee to have to move as it continues on its new path. Suddenly this one doomfire that originally just required 5 people in a group to move, might travel through the raid and cause 10-15 people total to have to move to avoid it. You effectively have turned what was originally 5 peoples problem into potentially 10-15 peoples problem, all in the name of 'a little extra dps' which wasnt even important to begin with.<br>
<br>
All this happened because the player broke the number 1 rule. 'Stay with your group and always move together'. The extra dps or healing - is not worth it.<br>
<br>
<u>If all 5 people run directly outwards together - it can target any or all of them and it'll still be going in one direction =  outwards.</u> If one person sidesteps it, you can create the nightmare problems like you mentioned which vastly complicate the effort required to avoid them , not just for yourself , but the rest of the raid as well.</div>

		<div id="post_message_531087">Yeah, I agree and know it was stupid. :p But this was coming after some attempts where healers had been moving very far away and being safe, but leading to increased danger on the tank. The thought then was maybe you can let a doomfire pass you and then sneak in behind. Obviously it didn't work and it yes was stupid. :p<br>
<br>
For the whole group moving, I know you said on some of the earlier posts that you like taking air bursts for groups together. So I assume for moving groups out you do the same thing? You have the whole group basically stand on top of the leader for the group and thus stay very tightly packed? Sometimes I've noticed we have a tendency to kind of spread out as a group. Everyone takes a different path running away and then after the doomfire passes we kind of meander back to our original spot.<br>
<br>
As for melee, I have a question about them. Is it possible for doomfire to target them and go after them or does it only go outwards from Archimonde? I am just wondering what the melee needs to do to avoid doomfires. I know a lot of it is ranged running back to keep them safe, but in the reading I've done I've not been able to really find out if a doomfire can spawn and then go straight into the melee.</div>

		<div id="post_message_531109">From my experience doomfire can spawn very close to melee, but not exactly on top of us. It can and will loop around eventually, heading straight towards the melee camp before stopping.<br>
<br>
The above leads me a few conclusions, some which may or may not be true<br>
<br>
-Doomfire doesn't actually target anybody in the raid and just randomly moves until it stops<br>
-Doomfire randomly targets someone other then melee and moves accordingly <br>
-Doomfire locks onto a target every few seconds which causes its sometimes weird movement<br>
-Doomfire performs like the above option, but can't target the melee until x amount of seconds have passed, preventing it from just staying on top of the melee camp the entire time<br>
<br>
Now I really don't know how doomfire acts nor will I give any suggestions on how to deal with it. The basics behind dealing with it are always true regardless of how it truly acts. Stay away from it and give yourself a lot of room when fear is cooled down. Just when you think you've figured doomfire out it does something you don't think it would do. I am more inclined to believe that it constantly targets players outside of Archimondes hit box intially and after so many seconds can loop around targetting melee.</div>

</div>Like the above poster said, you'll find best results when you put a symbol on each group leader and make it mandatory for their group to follow them. If people dont stand on them within 15 yards at all times , give them two choices: either 1) Stand on them or 2) Get out of the raid. Being a mage/decurser and officer, I can just yell on vent at people to stand on me and demand answers why if people are out of range, but if your decurser is shy or not used to talking on vent and saying something like 'Why the hell are you over there - stand on me NOW' - make sure group members dont take that as an excuse to get slack.<br>

</div>I think these three conclusions sound accurate. I have seen doomfire spawn and immediately head over melee once towards another range group - and that was only because the other range groups were just airbursted 100 yards away or running from doomfires. Only ever seen that happen once in about 60 attempts.  My guess is it works like this:<br>
<br>
A - It spawns and  locates the closest player that is at least X distance from the boss and begins to head outwards, either directly towards them or in that general area. This minimum distance could be something like , say, 10-20 yards (so all the melee/main tank are excluded from initial targetting)<br>
<br>
B - If the closest person at the minimum distance is on the opposite side of Archimonde, it might head directly over melee to reach them. This situation would occur in the picture below:<br>
<br>
1----------------------------------2<br>
<br>
----------------------------BOSS<br>
---------------------------melee <br>
----------------------------FIRE<br>
<br>
3----------------------------------------------------------5<br>
<br>
In this pic, we could see that groups 1/3/5 are all far away (been airbusted or run off). The freshly spawned doomfire targets the closest person at least X yards from archimonde - usually this would be groups 3 or 5, but it happens to be group 2. Upon heading towards group 2, the fire would have to travel directly over the melee, and possible disaster follows.<br>
<br>
This doesnt explain doomfire behaviour fully. Sometimes it just spawns and heads off in a direct line apparently chasing nobody until it despawns - cant explain that yet. But it gives a reasonable idea on why doomfires <i>always</i> seem to spawn and head <i>outwards</i> at first, except in rare cases where all the min-range targets happen to be on the opposite side of the boss.</div>

		<div id="post_message_531315">The best analogy for a doomfire is still a heat-seeking missile with a short frontal cone of tracking.  I have many, many times run a doomfire straight away from the middle all the way out until I get bored with it and hook back to where Archi is standing.  It requires me to play chicken a lot (often staying at that "burning but not doomed yet" position) but I have never, ever lost one once it had lock on me in such a situation provided there was no one else in the frontal arc.  You can even re-acquire a doomfire that you lost by getting in front of it again and turning it outwards but that's a dangerous game.<br>
<br>
The problem lies in the frontal cone targeting as best I can tell.  If there is me in front and close, I'll probably get kite control.  If there is myself and a few others and even if they are many yards away, it seems like it will occasionally move off towards them regardless of what I do.  That seems to be why moving the whole group has such a high success rate or at least that's it in my opinion.<br>
<br>
That all said, we just raid-mark decursers and flow with it.  It makes it much more difficult in some senses and we definitely have more doomfire issues than we might otherwise but it seems to work.  Some people are good at kiting the dooms away, some not so much.  We'll get some curl back and try to eat melee and that sucks.  Hell, some people will eat dooms on occasion and we heal through it, even if grumbling about it.</div>

		<div id="post_message_531351">The doomfires seem to spawn jut outside of max melee range.  As long as I can hit Archimonde a newly spawned doomfire cannot hit me, even though I may appear engulfed in flames briefly I won't get the doomfire debuff.<br>
<br>
Once they do spawn they always move away from him.  If I'm not in melee range and one spawns between Archimonde and myself I'm a legitimate target and have to run out.  The targetting from that point seems to be random selection of any target within a frontal cone.  This is anecdotal, but Ive seen new doomfires sit stationary when there is no one in front of it.  Im not sure if this is a bug or if the doomfires actually need a person to latch on to in a similar fashion to Buru or Thaladred.<br>
<br>
In support of what Tyrian posted, the idiots that cannot grasp the concept of "turn 180° from the boss, run in a straight line" are the ones that screw over the raid.  Trying to side step a doomfire when it turns toward you normally introduces new targets that it can latch on to.  If it turns far enough, the MT and melee around Archimonde become valid targets and bad things can happen.</div>

</div>Edit: I thought for sometime about your post and wanted to expand on what you said. <br>
<br>
Sometimes doomfires seem to spawn and trail off by themself apparently following nobody. Usually it seems to happen when the below picture happens:<br>
<br>
1--------------------2<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
--------BOSS fire===============&gt;<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
3--------------------4<br>
<br>
This freshly spawned fire doesnt have anyone in its frontal cone. Sometimes it will just head directly outwards. This somewhat contradicts earlier ideas that doomfires target the closest player at a minimum-range distance from the boss. It seems like sometimes doomfires arent even 'aware' of the raid unless they get an initial person in the frontal cone to lock onto. <br>
<br>
Actually, Its almost like a doomfires have a combat system. This goes hand-in-hand with the Heatseaking Missile analogy. A doomfire automatically gets 'in combat' with everyone in its frontal cone  and can decide to follow one or any of those people. If a doomfire cant get in combat because nobody is in its cone - it just trails off in what appears to be a 'random' direction, ignoring the raid unless somebody runs too close to it. This analogy could of course be wrong - but it would help explain many things:<br>
<br>
- why melee/mt never get initial targeting by doomfires (not in frontal cone) <br>
- why it usually follows an entire group successfully a long way out from the boss (its only in combat with that group in the frontal cone)<br>
- why some doomfires just trail off 'randomly' and ignore the raid if nobody is in the frontal cone when it spawns (nobody got in combat with it)<br>
- why some doomfires 'turn around' and head towards people that sidestepped it previously (they got in combat when they were in the frontal cone, even if they left the cone and it followed somebody else in the meantime)<br>
- why the 4point strat is much more successful in doomfire control to the semicircle strat (one group gets in combat and move together to quarantine the doomfire, preventing other people getting in combat)<br>
<br>
----<br>
<br>
My analogy to describe Doomfire behaviour: <br>
<br>
The doomfire is a Thaledred-type mob that only gets 'in combat' with everyone in its frontal cone and can follow any of them. Once in combat with that doomfire, you stay in combat until it despawns, regardless of whether you sidestep or leave the frontal cone. <br>
<br>
Its therefore the responsibility of <b>all </b>the people who get in combat to make sure the cone is always 'aimed outwards' from the boss - so you can avoid getting other groups/melee/mt in combat or risk having it head towards them instead of you. In a 4-point strat, 5 people at a time (the 4 range groups) get in combat and run off <b>together </b>in an attempt to quarantine the doomfire and prevent spreading combat to other parts of the raid. <br>
<br>
This also means that you should NEVER sidestep a doomfire that you got in combat with, even if it appears to be  following someone else - because if your still in combat with it, it might turn around and come back for you and get other people in combat as well.<br>
<br>
----<br>
<br>
The more I think about it, the more that analogy very accurately describes the behaviour and movement of doomfires. Thinking about it this way, doomfires are like a plague and the  4-point group setup is a way to 'quarantine them by preventing minimal combat spreading'.</div>

These?<br>
<br>
As well; thanks to this thread we got our 1st two kills knocked out on Archimonde and we we're more concerned with repeating the kill then getting the first. Fortuntate enough to get the second kill with only 1 death due to an offline in a doomfire and our first with only 3 deaths.</div>

		<div id="post_message_537106">We've been using the 4-point strategy.  We had a few hours working on him, and we had some kinks with where the groups were positioning themselves.  But the doomfires were following people, and the fight seemed controllable.  The doomfires were reacting as this thread described: like heat-seeking missiles.<br>
<br>
After realizing that our positioning was off, I had high hopes that everything would fall into place on our next raid.  Tonight we spent the whole night on him, and everyone was in their correct positions, sticking together as groups, and... ATTEMPTING to kite the doomfires away.<br>
<br>
The doomfires simply did not follow people.  They literally zig-zagged everywhere without any rhyme or reason.  I watched a doomfire right on my tail veer off in a totally random direction, and there was NOBODY in that direction.  It then wrapped right around to the melee.  I saw that happen at least 3 or 4 times.  When it *didn't* wrap around, it still did not follow us.  It just kind of meandered on it's own path.<br>
<br>
The only thing we did different was *fix* our positions (before, the groups were not properly at 90degree angles, but more clumped up).  Also, this time our melee was in two groups to avoid having all of them airbursted at the same time.<br>
<br>
Any ideas what was going on?</div>

		<div id="post_message_537113">We had similar experiences with doomfires on our 360 positionings.  Sometimes doomfire would just take sharp turns and switch targets to people far away or just veer off into the open field and not even attempt to follow anyone.  Although the heatseeking misslle discription seems to fit somewhat, I dont think it's the whole mechanic.  There does seem to be a minor but significant random component to it.  For us we decided that the 4 corners thing didn't work well for us as it thinned out healing/decursing coverage too much and we decided to go with 180 positioning and heal thru 1-2 people getting DF'd now and then.  It worked much better for us and we got our first kill yesterday.<br>
<br>
I think Archimonde more than any other fight is just something every guild needs to feel their way through.  The mechanics are obvious after 3 attempts , but it takes 50 more worth of trial and error to see what does / doesn't work for your group.</div>

</div>For what it's worth we don't ask people to kite doomfires away unless it's really, blatantly chasing them down like an episode of COPS.  We did notice a change in this behavior of doomfires as they've changed over time - personally I think it's more deep breaths but some of our raiders swear they don't follow as predictably.  Knowing when it's safe to strafe versus bailing away from Archimonde is equal parts knowing the fear cooldown and the black art of willing your raid to succeed.</div>

</div>Realise that nothing you described here is inherantly 'bad' or raid-wiping on its own. Theres nothing wrong with a doomfire heading in the mele direction, <b><u>if</u></b> you see it happening and warn people in advance so they can prepare.  In your case, you wouldve told the melee on vent to run off and they would all run away and wait until it despawns and is safe to return = no harm done.<br>

</div>From reading your quote, it sounds like people need to realise doomfires can and will get messy at times - and this is normal - dont panic when they go in a bad direction - just warn the people its heading towards. Heres a good way to see it:<br>
<br>
<b>Ideal</b>: Doomfire spawns and heads outwards in a perfect 150 yard straight line from archimonde and then despawns.<br>
<br>
<b>Reality</b>: This isnt going to happen as much as youd like.  The best you can try to do is try to 'pull it out' from archimonde for about 20-30 seconds , hopefully about 60-100 yards. At this point - even if it arcs or turns around youve done your job. <br>
<br>
Dont have your raid go into archimonde attempts thinking you will turn all doomfires into perfect 150 yard straight lines and then panic when it doesnt happen. Therefore, prepare in advance ways to communicate fast and effectively when the doomfire hasnt moved in the direction you tried to take it. Having to scream on vent 'MELEE RUN, its turned around!' now and then, is a normal part of the fight.<br>
<br>
In reference to your 'zig zag' comment -  its normal for fires to create a whole mess on an entire side of archimonde, even if your groups are trying their best to pull them in a straight line away. However this quote is interesting..<br>

	</tbody></table>
</div>How many melee do you have, enough to need to split into 2 groups O-O ? <br>
<br>
In our setup there are only 7 people in melee range of archimonde and only 5 of them are actually melee dps. I never vary from this setup, I will not put more than 5 melee in an archimonde raid (the 5 melee always get a get a tremor totem to protect them) unless we can have some sort of fw protection for the 6th+ melee, which is rare. Its safer to put that FW on a healer instead of bringing a 6th+ melee dps. Lack of dps won't ordinarily wipe you... but lack of healing certainly can.<br>
<br>
This is of course just what we do in our guild, others might operate very differently with regard to raid setup:<br>
<br>
Only people in melee range of archimonde:<br>
- 1 MT<br>
- 1 Druid decurser (standing on the melee, but not in their group, usually has FW protection)<br>
- 5 Melee dps (with a shaman always in their group , preferably dps enhancement shaman)<br>
<br>
If you run with so many melee your trying to split them into two groups - you might be increasing the chance a doomfire comes towards the middle. After all, it does appear to have a random component on who it follows. <br>
<br>
Therefore the less people in the middle the better (you want it to follow ranged/healers, not melee) Anyway that might not be the source of your problems.. but if you run with more than 5 melee (excluding mt/decurser) you might be creating a self-inflicted problem. The fight is about playing it safe - and you will make your raid alot safer if you limit the amount of melee you bring, in my  opinion, as it will make doomfire control more manageable.</div>

<br>
We had 7 people in melee range, as you did.<br>
<br>
If, as you say, the doomfires sometimes got unruly and did their own thing that would be one thing.  However, last night the doomfires never followed anyone.  This is in direct contrast to what we experienced on our first attempt at the fight, where they acted like you had described throughout this thread.<br>
<br>
I'm wondering if something we changed caused this unpredictable behavior, because it's either that, or we were incredibly unlucky, or it was an "Onyxia deep breaths more" kind of thing.<br>
<br>
Currently, we're about to follow Raiste's suggestion, as we're not controlling the doomfires at all with the 4-point strategy.  But if anyone has a clue as to why things were different for us, we may try to make the 4-point strategy work.<br>

		<div id="post_message_537821">Ive seen doomfires <i>sometimes </i>not act as you would like, but overall they seem to very consistently follow groups outward with correct movement/setup. <br>
<br>
If your using 4 tight groups, always moving together - running directly out from the boss in a straight line - im at a slight loss why you say they just zigzag. At a first guess, I wouldve guessed people are not moving out as a tight group - yet move off in an arc giving the doomfire a wide range of targets in multiple directions which it might decide to move to. <br>
<br>
 Ive read many people in the thread comment on how easily/well it works for them. I still would put it down to some problem in raid setup/movement (it cant work so well for lots of guilds and just apparently not work for another - if everyones doing the same thing) , but cant think what it could be atm.

				<div style="font-style:italic">Can someone help answer a question we had today. We killed Archimonde today in 9 minutes 55 seconds - a mere 5 seconds off his enrage (previous kills were usually 8 minutes... lots of melee airbusts today :S) and we were wondering what the enrage actually does as nobody I have asked has every seen it. So..<br>
<br>
- Whats Archimondes enrage do exactly? (Ive heard it wipes you instantly.. Is it a raidwide finger of death and everyone just falls over dead instantly? Or does he oneshot the tank and run around killing people like normal boss enrages)<br>
<br>
- Does the 10 minute enrage kill you IF your still invulernable with Protection of Elune shield? Thats what we were concerned about today. I told the raid if he reaches 10 minutes he might kill us even though we have the shield on - but im not sure if thats how it works. Does the enrage only wipe you after the shield wears off, or goes through it immediately?</div>

		<div id="post_message_540796">Heres a WWS of a typical kill for us: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302203212/http://wowwebstats.com/c5j6suildjeq3?s=6148-6636" target="_blank">Wow Web Stats</a><br>
<br>
Ive noticed with our setup (one melee group) the 5 melee dps alone usually account for about 50-55% of total damage received to Archimonde. All ranged dps can be anywhere between 300-700 dps typically with DPSPresence time varying hugely (between 20-80%) = all obviously totally dependant on how many doomfires/airbursts their group had to deal with.<br>
<br>
Im interested in what success various guilds have had in improving repeatability of Archimonde kills. Has anyone noticed a consistent improvement in the number of attempts its taken to get your guilds Archimonde kills weekly - as your guild members get more experience with the fight/strategy? Or do you find yourself often going backwards/stuck at a certain number of attempts/not improving or going round in circles.<br>
<br>
For us (after 5 kills) the number of attempts to get a kill has been something like: 25 attempts, 21 attempts, 20 attempts, 9 attempts, 5 attempts.  Some of the bad nights with higher attempts actually had better raid setup than lower attempt nights (more shamans) - but overall, looks like number of attempts is slowly dropping down as people familiarise themself with the fight more and more.</div>

</div>Yes. We get tremor instead of SoE from our enh shaman when the Fear cooldown is up. That plus a 2 minute trinket and CloS makes Doomfire almost always a nonissue, unless it's really stacking up near the hitbox.<br>

We also have a resto druid primarily devoted to healing and decursing the melee, if that helps to answer your question.</div>

</div>That makes sense.  We have killed him like 12 or 13 times now and I have still not done it with a shaman in my group.  Basically I trust the rogues and warriors on this fight to be smarter than my nuke-happy casters and lead-footed healers, i guess.  It really would make the fight much faster, however, to give the melee group that assurance and just put the "smarter" healers/casters in a non-shaman group.  I will give it a whirl this week and see how it goes.</div>

		<div id="post_message_542728">We killed it again yesterday, but dear god, this fight frustrates me like no other.  It might be our incredibly paucity of shamans, but even with fear ward, that fight sucks complete ass.<br>
<br>
What was even worst is that we had a ret paladin along who wasn't in the only melee tremor totem group and he died twice through no fault of his own because he'd get feared while in melee range and just end up dying to doomfires.  We replaced him with a warlock and immediately killed him in two attempts.<br>
<br>
Two questions then:<br>
Does anyone know if there is a way to bring some melee DPS that are not backed with tremor totem without them being a liability?  We have 1 enh shaman on most raids, and 1 resto shaman maybe 30% of the raids.  Can a rogue reliably dps without tremor totem and getting killed?<br>
<br>
We had a few ferals DPSing as well, but they could decurse and shift out + heal much more effectively than the ret paladin.<br>
<br>
I heard rumours about waves of trash that spawn after Archimonde is dead.  Where do they spawn?  We tried killing a few of the NPC's from the undead base near the alliance base, but they didn't give faction or seem lootable.</div>

</div>Undead rogues with the 2 minute PvP trinket can do reliable DPS. Those and dps warriors are the only ones that doesn't require a tremor totem.<br>

</div>Almost yes, but not 100%. Melee will always be close to doomfires and "basically" is just not good enough. They need a 100% reliable way of breaking fear every 30-40 seconds.<br>
<br>
Ranged got the option of moving really far away from doomfires, enough so they can run around feared for the full duration or at least until their fear can be dispelled. Melee doesn't have that option, they need to be able to handle the fear almost instantly. CloS doesn't help you one bit if you're feared into the doomfire eating multiple 2400 damage ticks, it's only good if you're also able to break the fear.</div>

</div>For a guild learning the fight, id say - Yes its possible to bring extra melee (that dont have tremor totem protection) , but do yourself a favour and dont.<br>
<br>
If you absolutely must bring extra melee, I would tell them to run off in a 'safe direction' 10-15 seconds seconds before every fear is due,  get feared - then return when its safe. Or they might want to try the stump-hump method. <br>
<br>
But still, its much easier to just bring range classes instead - and limit melee to one group with tremor totem protection.</div>

</div>Well, don't want to go Off-topic but we had similar issues (although 200 hearts seems odd - you only need 4 crafted pieces per person, not 5) but nothing some trash farms didn't solve. Keep Teron/Bloodboil trash and farm them in your off-days. Mother trash is also good.</div>

		<div id="post_message_543016">My guild is currently working on Archimonde.  We've put in about 10 hours or 3 full raids on him, coming out to around 80 total attempts.  Our best attempt was 55%, and we've had him to the mid-60's about 3-4 other times.  That's about where everything falls apart.<br>
<br>
All 80 attempts, we have had four shaman.  Yes, <b>four</b>.  That's a tremor totem for almost every group!  Everyone has either the 5 min or 2 min PvP trinket.  We've all had ample practice on using the tears to reduce fall damage and on reacting to the doomfire and have gotten better at "kiting" it.  We have one group of melee (4 rogues + enhancement shaman) and each of the remaining four groups stand on top of each other at each corner around Archimonde, forming a square.  Each ranged group has 1-2 decursers and 2 healers.<br>
<br>
I just can't pinpoint what our problem is.  It seems to be something different every time.  Early in last night's raid, the MT was dying because the healers weren't coordinating their fears (I guess).  We fixed that and then people started dying to other random crap -- one time it would be because someone didn't get decursed in time, which normally isn't a problem.  The next time someone would fail to use their tears properly.  Then someone gets feared into fire.  Nothing is consistent and it doesn't seem like there's a key issue that we can work on / talk about to fix our problems.  It's different every single time.

Do your wipes always spiral out of control after the first soul charge? I think a key part to working this fight out is being able to recover from a single soul charge; everyone needs to know that it's coming, so they can do whatever it takes to survive it. Are people calling and healing through doomfires effectively? How is the raid positioned? If you have a number of people who are failing inconsistently, you might try the camps strategy. We settled on another strategy, because you run the risk of losing too many groups all at once, but I think it will provide more consistency than you're currently seeing. If you are using the groups strategy, there was some talk in this thread about it recently, but the key is making sure that the group does everything together. Put a mark on a leader, preferably a decurser or a healer, and make sure that they move closely together.</div>

</div>For the most part, we can survive a single soul charge.  We will call out when someone is low and when they die so the raid can be topped off and the healers can prepare.  We have both wiped to and survived through a single soulcharge, once we even lived through two!  That's just luck I suppose.<br>
<br>
We are grouped up by our parties, forming a square around Archimonde, also known as the camp strategy I guess.  There is a capitan for each group who is marked with a raid symbol and is responsible for notifying over vent what is happening with that group.  This allows the healers who are still in the fight to realize, group 1 is running from doomfire, group 2 is flying in the air from air burst, group 3 is feared, group 4 better start using their big heals.  We also announce when that group returns within range of Archimonde/the MT.</div>

<br>
At the risk of this sounding like a lame response (for which I can only apologise), a great deal of this fight is the mindset with which people go into it.<br>
Perhaps it really needs to be iterated with your guild that the most important thing here is to not die? You mentioned that there is always something going wrong with someone dying. There is a significant element of randomness about this fight yes, but in my experience most of it comes from people simply watching out for any potential damage around them. Once they stop worrying about dps-ing Archimonde or topping meters, and start focusing more simply on their position, it does get noticeably easier.<br>
Other than that, I can't find anything wrong with what you say you're doing, so I'd recommend you just keep trying and be patient. Again, there is an element of luck involved but I'd perhaps look to ensure everyone dumps any meters they have for this fight and just focus on doing absolutely anything they can to stay alive as that is what will win you the fight.<br>
<br>
Also, I'd suggest you fix your profile Anonymity as soon as possible. Avoiding showing it is a fast track to infractions and a ban on this forum, I've noticed. Just a friendly suggestion.</div>

Yes a lot of random things happen, but what they do to you isn't all that random and can for the most part be easily avoided. You can easily get caught in a circle of endless wiping with the general excuse of "Oh this fight is so fucking random". What happened is mostly one person or more not being careful and wiping the raid as a consequence.</div>

</div>There is a cast time on fear. If you vanish while he is casting you won't get feared the same goes for feign death afaik. Also if your shaman drops his tremor totem in that bracket you'll instantly get out of the fear aswell (tremor ticks one second after being droped and then every 4? seconds afaik).<br>
<br>
<br>
The other thing is surviving soulcharges is what makes rekilling this encounter easily doable. We've survived 7 deaths (not at once, but 1 charge after another) and went on to a kill. While still learning the encounter for us at least it was just a matter of drilling into peoples heads that living is important as well as people making the mistakes once (or some people more than that :x ).<br>

As for your retribution paladin, tell him to swap on heal gear and be in a no-tremor group with a priest.  Alternate fear breaks with your pvp trinket and dispel the fears off the rest of the group - "Ghetto Tremor".  You don't need exceptional healing or regen on this fight (for this role, that is).  <br>
<br>
Here is my terrible video of the ret "back up" healer, and our shaman-less group.  Our mentality is simply "Take care of self, then contribute to raid".  As you can see, most of the time we get airbursted together to avoid grip issues, and try to stick together.  <br>

<br>
<br>
Regarding the point where "random" things happen to cause deaths, make sure everyone is doing everything in their power to avoid those deaths.  If you get feared into a doomfire, you're PVP trinket better have been on cooldown.  Even then, most doomfires can be avoided by standing away from them before a fear goes off.  If you died to airburst/grip, you better have healthstoned/potted  before you died.  There have been countless times a simple healthstone/pot gave someone enough time to get a decurse after they were airbursted, and a decurser should be running to this person as well.<br>
<br>
Using recount, we have a "competition" amongst decursers which gives a healthy urgency to the subject ;p  It makes me cry when a mage finishes their fireball before they decide to decurse.</div>

				All 80 attempts, we have had four shaman. Yes, four. That's a tremor totem for almost every group! Everyone has either the 5 min or 2 min PvP trinket. We've all had ample practice on using the tears to reduce fall damage and on reacting to the doomfire and have gotten better at "kiting" it. We have one group of melee (4 rogues + enhancement shaman) and each of the remaining four groups stand on top of each other at each corner around Archimonde, forming a square. Each ranged group has 1-2 decursers and 2 healers.<br>
<br>
I just can't pinpoint what our problem is. It seems to be something different every time. Early in last night's raid, the MT was dying because the healers weren't coordinating their fears (I guess). We fixed that and then people started dying to other random crap -- one time it would be because someone didn't get decursed in time, which normally isn't a problem. The next time someone would fail to use their tears properly. Then someone gets feared into fire. Nothing is consistent and it doesn't seem like there's a key issue that we can work on / talk about to fix our problems. It's different every single time. Usually these are just "getting to know the fight" concepts that people learn over time, but really, 12 hours? How much longer should it really take for people to start "getting" this fight?

</div>It sounds like you have the basic strat strong - but the problem is how you handle player deaths. As a raid leader, do you ask people on Archimonde 'How did you die?' after every attempt? If so they will usually say one of two things:<br>
<br>
1 - "There was nothing I could do"  and<br>
2 - "It was just bad luck".<br>
<br>
In my opinion, 9 out of 10 times - either of those reasons is a flat out lie, or bullshit. I put pressure on people who die during Archimonde raids and ask them to respond on vent (with everyone listening) to describe the situation they died. Then ill explain what they could have done better to prevent that happening next time. If you die on archimonde - you have a responsibility to let the raid know why - there is no escaping and pretending it didnt happen. Nobody likes dying and having to explain to the raid the silly mistakes they made - And dont even try the 'it was bad luck' bullshit, please, I wont buy it.<br>
<br>
People who dont pot, or stand 5 yards from a doomfire and get feared into one will say theres nothing they can do and palm it off as 'bad luck'.. People might claim its bad luck after standing out of range of a decurser then getting feared and dying to the curse. People can say its also bad luck when they die from doomfire after having stayed close to archimonde trying to get a little more dps off before moving from it. Some people claim its bad luck if they dont have their pvp trinket up, because they used it the fear prior when they have absolutely no need to. Melee might claim its bad luck that a doomfire comes up behind them and kills them - when in reality somebody in the range groups should have just warned them on vent.<br>
<br>
Do you use WWS? I always have a giggle when people who say 'Nothing I could do' are proved wrong with WWS... and never used a pot or healthstone - it happens more than we'd like to admit. WWS is a great tool for identifying problems like this. Like the above poster said, if you die you better have used a healthstone/healthpot first. Let people know you use WWS and will have a look at the end of night. Playeres have a responsibility for selfsurvival too with consumable usage - not just relying on healers.<br>
<br>
<b>If you have a solid strategy, first and foremost, there are very few situations where you can genuinely blame your death on 'bad luck' or 'random crap'. </b><br>

</div>What attitude does your raid leader have when it comes to responding to players who answer 'Why did you die?' on Archimonde? From your above quote, if sounds as if your brushing it off as 'random crap' and somewhat acceptable. If you die - its <i>probably </i>your own fault (Whitemanes post above said it well). In fact I would settle to say 'You die = Your fault' for 90%+ of the time.<br>
<br>
After reading your post on how you seem to be using a strong 4-point setup I would echo the other posters and question your raid players survival mentality. If the raid leader allowed poor play as an acceptable excuse for dying - then people dont have any compelling reason to improve, because they probably dont think its their fault in the first place (when it very likely could be).<br>
<br>
When we learnt Archimonde, after every wipe and every stupid player death -  I made it very clear people shouldnt blame 'the randomess of the fight' but instead look for what the player could have done to prevent or  avoid the situation happening in the first place. If your guild goes into Archimonde with the 'oh its just so fucking random' attitude - your asking for problems - because its not.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
PS: Are you using a retro druid standing on the melee btw? Thats an excellent way to boost your setup. That druid is responsible for mt/melee decurse and can keep heals on the MT when other groups have to run off or get airbursted away. However because hes in a very dangerous position (melee range) with no tremor totem (not in the melee group) - you need to take care of him well. Either FW rotation or have a ret pally in the melee group who can dispel him after every fear.</div>

		<div id="post_message_543516">"Other random crap" started dissapearing fairly quickly when I, as Raid Leader, decided to change groups on every try, making sure to see, what exactly is wrong on every corner(4 groups + melee for us). There is indeed plenty of things that can go wrong with people and going there myself and telling them when to move away, when to stay, all the simple things, helped out a lot. Shrugging it off as "random crap" made us wipe way longer than we should. Also, sometimes it's some minor things that people might not know, like being bit too far away from Archi as melee making you viable target for new DF, and which RL should know and tell. Once it becomes a habit for those people, you can work on another weak link.<br>
<br>
Beside that, what helped us was communication betweem different groups. It's not enough to have group look after themselves, they must tell others what's happening. If Doomfire is heading back into melee, they must be warned. If it ignored your group and is heading for another one - say it. Communication is what makes a huge difference. Unless you have perfect 25 raiders who will always notice everything, there will be some situation where they will fail to see danger and need a quick yell to make them avoid it. It mostly affects melee, but sometimes it's also hard to notice new DF as ranged, if there is already one obstructing your vision.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Almost yes, but not 100%. Melee will always be close to doomfires and "basically" is just not good enough. They need a 100% reliable way of breaking fear every 30-40 seconds.<br>

Ranged got the option of moving really far away from doomfires, enough so they can run around feared for the full duration or at least until their fear can be dispelled. Melee doesn't have that option, they need to be able to handle the fear almost instantly. CloS doesn't help you one bit if you're feared into the doomfire eating multiple 2400 damage ticks, it's only good if you're also able to break the fear.</div>

		<div id="post_message_544345">I have some questions about the nature of doomfire and its pathing. My shaman's guild is currently working on Archimonde. Part of our strategy involves "kiting" the doomfires away from the raid. We have a group at each of the 4 corners (NW, SW, NE, and SE) and melee under him (but far enough a way to not air burst the MT) If a fire spawns in NE corner, the NE group runs back (everyone) away from archimonde until the fire despawns. At first, I went along with the idea that the doomfires were like heat-seeking missles and would lock onto certain targets. But after spending 3 nights (2 of them full) on Archimonde, I've started questioning that assumption.<br>
<br>
This is the post I made on the guild forums where I referenced this thread. I've cleaned it up to make it less argumentative. I apologize for the length:<br>

				Ok, after the last 2.5 nights we've spent on Archimonde, I'm really starting to doubt that these fires are 100% controllable. We've seen them go in straight lines, curves, circles, and hooks in situations where the "group in the cone" is there to grab it and times when it isn't.<br>
<br>
If we're going on the cone theory, how does a fire "follow" a group, say...SW for about 10 yards, loop around, and then go right through the melee to the NE? There was somebody that said "oh, well you moved too far out of range of it so it targeted somebody else". So the closest people to it that its been following gets too far away, and therefore it goes for some target even farther away?<br>
<br>
We said at one point, if it spawns right in front of you need to run backwards, not strafe to the side, but backwards with it. There were times when, even though the whole group ran together, the fire would change directions, either head off to no-man's-land or go back the way it came. <br>
<br>
Then we're like "well, if you move out of the way really fast, it won't know you're there and keep going straight!" There was one instance with group 4 where the fire spawned by <i>blank</i> and went straight by her. Yet, it appeared that the fire came back after her and she got burned. We later blamed her for not running the fire away from Archimonde. Now, lets think about this. The fire goes straight on its merry way for about...oh...10 seconds...with no target, and then somehow decides to grab one? Lets say <i>blank</i> did get in its "cone". Why wouldn't it go for her immediately? Why would the fire go after nothing, and then something?<br>
<br>
I think the reason it <u>appears</u> that the fire chases somebody has to do with people being too spread out at times. When we weren't together in our tight knit groups (which I wasn't always, I'll admit), there's a higher chance for the fire to path through a single person, and give reason for the vigilant observer to exclaim"see, look! It's following people!" when in fact its a simple issue of probability (more people occupying more space, thus, higher chance of fire going through one of said occupied spaces). <br>
<br>
I read some parts of the EJ post. Somebody early on laughed at the notion that the fires were controllable. Post 129: <br>

</div>The 2 bolded parts are absolutely ridiculous assertions.<br>
<br>
There is NOTHING we can do about what direction Doomfire decides to take. None. If you think there is, please, show me FRAPS or something where you 100% of the time steer it where you want to. The simple fact is, it does what it wants, and the players HAVE NO CONTROL over it. You can run directly away from Arch, and the fire might follow you, or it might decide that it wants to loop around the Shadow Priest you just ran by, or any number of possible routes.<br>
<br>
There is NOTHING we can do about when he feels like using his abilities, or on whom. Grip has a 50k(Anywhere) range, Fear has a 99yd range, and Air Burst has a 60yd (EL) range. Outranging is only really feasible with Air Burst, and, ironically, Air Burst is the only one that can really be controlled in the sense of how many people it hits.<br>
<br>
So, we have 4 completely random abilities, and you're saying the fight is all about controlling these abilities? No, no I'm sorry, but that's simply false.<br>
<br>
Survival is key, and pretty much the only thing that any participant in this encounter can hope to do. Stay near a shaman, stay near a healer, and for the love of all that's holy, don't get the stupid Doomfire debuff.

</div>I make the same challenge. If these fires are really controllable, show me a video of people consistently guiding them away from the group.

				Heres a test picture I made before we killed archimonde, when we were discussing positioning. Every guild uses different strats for group setup and positioning, as u can see we opted for a 4 point square around archimonde (group 5 is the melee group). This is what worked best for us - it may or may not work for your guild.<br>
<br>
The trick is:<br>
<br>
- when doomfire spawns that whole group runs in a straight line away from the boss as far as possible until the doomfire stops following you. Dont stop, dont try to sidestep it - the entire group keeps running in a straight line away as far as you can.<br>
<br>
- each group is a fully self-sufficient unit - with its own healers and a decurser with a symbol. You always stay together: therefore you all get airbusted together (so nobody is ever out of range of their healer/decurser) and you ALL move together when a doomfire comes towards your group, regardless of which person in the group its actually following. Standing with your group is very high priority, so after any fears or situations where your positions get forcibly changed - moving back to your group decurser symbol is top priority.<br>
<br>
<b>This means that, even if the doomfire turns around and comes back for melee, by the time its back it will almost be close to despawning because it has a large travel time to 'snake back' before it reaches the melee. With good vent communication you will be able to alert your melee well in advance if this is happening so they can run off.</b><br>
<br>
<b>It almost always spawns (in my observations) and heads immediately outwards towards the closest ranged/healers for 10-15 seconds before theres a chance it will 'loop around' and chase melee. That 10-15 seconds is crucial as its the time you want to get it to move as far away (in that straight line) from the boss as you can.</b>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>This guy is saying that even if you run it back, it will sometimes loop around uncontrollably. What makes this happen? Is this a random element or the fire acting intelligently and picking another far off topic? <br>
<br>
Last paragraph, he says that it heads outward immediately to the closest ranged/healers for 10/15 seconds. How does this explain fires going in straight lines or fires that go straight for awhile then decide to hook around? If these things are controllable from the getgo, they should stick with their targets and never look back. <br>
<br>
All these theories about the doomfires being actual mobs with aggro tables or cones of aggro tables are, <b>in my opinion</b>, the BC equivalent of the wild beliefs about Onyxia's deepbreath. People who killed her for years had different theories on how the deep breath worked. Some said that it had to do with the amount of DPS you did to her, others said that by keeping lots of dots on her, she wouldn't breath. Finally, others would say it had to do with positioning, that if people "clumped up" she would blast you. Yet none of these theories, when executed could prevent deep breath, just like how all these theories about doomfire can't completely control their directions.<br>
<br>
But here's my wild and crazy theory on doomfires, based on Occam's razor: The fires spawn, they make pretty designs in the ground, and then they despawn. Yes, they won't go through walls or in the water, but other then that, they go in random directions. I'm not saying because of this that there's nothing you can do about them, quite the opposite in fact. The fires, imo, are meant to be avoided (<b>melee included</b>), not somehow kited. You stick with your groups to prevent being too spread out and to prevent the chance of somebody getting burned, and you get out of the way of doomfire.

</div>By posting this, I'm not trying to say that I think my theories on doomfire is correct and everyone else is wrong, but rather to illustrate the direction I'm coming from. Am I right about the nature of the doomfire or is there a flaw in my logic? Is the general consensus among the who post on these forums that the doomfires follow certain people or do the move in randomly generated paths? If it's the former, what evidence is there to support this?<br>
<br>

</div>You mean they'll aim for somebody when they spawn and then they'll go off on their own? For a period of time during our 1st or 2nd night, we decided to try a 3 group strategy (NW, SW, SE). On at least 2 occassions, a doomfire that spawned in the NE traveled in a straight line to the NE (or at least in a trajectory over 90 degrees off from any player). I considered the possibility of the "initial target and then randomness" theory at one point, but seeing those fires go absolutely nowhere made me think otherwise.<br>
<br>
If a doomfire heads through one of your group's positions, what do you normally do? Do you have them make a 180 and run from Archimonde or do you have them go to another corner (i.e. fire in NE corner, NE group moves to North or East, etc)?</div>

</div>I disagree, they are meant to be kited as much as possible - but this does <b>not </b>mean they follow you 100% of the time. <br>
<br>
Doomfires (based on my observation) have a very strong 'follow a player' component but <b>also</b> have a 'go whatever direction I want' component and alternate between them at will. The trick is kiting them away as far as possible when they are in follow-a-player mode. The further you can pull a doomfire from the boss when its following a player, the less likely it'll cause problems when it decides to head in a random direction (as it will despawn before reaching anyone to cause problems)<br>
<br>
The best analogy I have thought of for doomfire movement and behaviour is this:<br>
<br>
<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px; ">
	<div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom:0px"><img src="assets/citation.gif" border="0"></div>
	<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" border="0" width="100%">
	<tbody><tr>
		<td class="alt2" style="border:1px inset">
			
				Analogy to describe Doomfire behaviour: <br>
<br>
1 = The doomfire is a Thaledred-type mob that only gets 'in combat' with everyone in its frontal cone and can follow any of them. Once in combat with that doomfire, you stay in combat until it despawns, regardless of whether you sidestep or leave the frontal cone. <br>
<br>
2 = Doomfires can follow anyone 'in combat' but also can move in a random direction. If there are people in its frontal cone in that random direction, they will get in combat too.<br>
<br>
Its therefore the responsibility of all the people who get in combat to make sure the cone is always 'aimed outwards' from the boss - so you can avoid getting other groups/melee/mt in combat or risk having it head towards them instead of you. In a 4-point strat, 5 people at a time (the 4 range groups) get in combat and run off together in an attempt to quarantine the doomfire and prevent spreading combat to other parts of the raid. <br>
<br>
This also means that you should NEVER sidestep a doomfire that you got in combat with, even if it appears to be following someone else - because if your still in combat with it, it might turn around and come back for you and get other people in combat as well.

		<div id="post_message_544395"><b>Doomfire is controllable.</b> It follows someone then either changes targets or reaches a maximum range from Archimonde where it is forced to curve back.<br>
<br>
 If you can't see the pattern by now try having all players strafe the fire sideways instead of running backward on one attempt; and all of the fires will constantly curve inward into the raid.<br>
The next attempt, have anyone who looks like the fire is chasing them run directly outward from Archimonde, and the Doomfires will travel in a straight line for a while then curve when it changes targets.<br>
<br>
What seems painfully obvious is, a doomfire isn't going to travel in a straight line without a player in front of it. The doomfire pathing has boundaries and could target a player behind it (making it move in a large arc) and the AI adjusts, making look like it is targeting nothing. And yes the correct, minimum-risk method to deal with doomfire is to run outward from Archimonde until the fire curves away from you, then resume fighting.</div>

				I make the same challenge. If these fires are really controllable, show me a video of people consistently guiding them away from the group.

</div>Nobody has said you can  make doomfires 100% do every exact thing  and move every direction you want. Nobody will have a video of 50 doomfires following 50 groups in 50 perfect 150 yard lines and then despawning. Unfortunately, the fight isnt as clean as that - it gets messy at times because doomfires appear to have some random component as well.<br>
<br>
Try the experiment the above poster suggested and the results should be convincing. Your not trying to make perfect straight-line doomfires here, your just trying to get them to move as far away from the boss as possible when they decide to follow a player (which isnt 100% of the time).</div>

Anywho, The "half random, half targets people" doomfire idea is believable. It would explain the wide range of doomfires patterns I've seen. Like when it goes off in one direction (in almost a straight line) when there is no group anywhere) or when it targets people that were never in its "frontal cone".<br>
<br>
When the doomfire appears to be following a group, and you have that group run it away from archimonde, at what point is it safe to make your way back? When it despawns or when its traveled x yards away and/or has traveled x amount of time away from the group? <br>
<br>
I think another issue we had was with melee. Certain people believed that, with good kiting, you could prevent the doomfires from ever going into the melee.  If I'm reading the above posters correctly, then there's no way to fully prevent this. You can try to reduce this chance by "kiting" the fires away, but they may just decide to change directions (either randomly or picking a new target), and its up to the melee to watch out for those doomfires. Is that correct?</div>

</div>In my experience, yes. Despite your best efforts, there will be times where a doomfire just doesnt seem to want to do what you want. However, you can minimise the amount of times doomfires go for melee with kiting and positioning - as other posters mentioned.<br>
<br>
Thats all you really need. If you can get <i>most </i>doomfires to head outwards for 50+% of travel distance, your doing a good job.  Realise that there can and will be times you will have to react fast and warn melee when things dont go as expected - its a normal part of the fight.<br>

	</tbody></table>
</div>As a general guide id say: If a doomfire spawns and is obviously following your group - keep running for as long as it follows you - even if that means running 100-150+ yards from the boss. <br>
<br>
If the doomfire starts to arc off after following you about 80 yards out (about half its total travel distance) and go somewhere else - you should be able to return to your original position (as the doomfire will despawn by the time it reaches you if it turned around)<br>
<br>
If a doomfire spawns and only follows you a very short distance (eg 30 yards) then veers off, its probably best to stay back a few seconds and watch it carefully = chances are you will have to warn your melee group or an adjacent range group to move who might not see it coming. These are the dangerous ones and its probably just safer to stay away and wait until they despawn.</div>

<br>
All the raid members under flask, i changed the raid configuration many many many times, kick  some hunter to get some frost mages, we are chain pulling, again and again...<br>
<br>
What do you think about our line up ? <br>
<br>
Healers : 9 <br>
<br>
- 4 Pallys<br>
- 1 Priest<br>
- 2 Chamans (on 2 different groups)<br>
- 2 Droods<br>
<br>
Ranged dps: 10<br>
<br>
- 4 Frost mage<br>
- 2 Warlocks<br>
- 2 Hunters<br>
- 2 Shadow P.<br>
<br>
Melee dps: 6<br>

- 1 Chaman<br>
- 2 Warrios (1 Fury, 1 Arm) (2 when our cham is not around)<br>
- 1 Drood<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
We are all around the boss and we spread out of the fire line as much we can but sometime:<br>
<br>
- Random fear get the random player into the fire dot, he is bump, he dies like a mad cow.<br>
- Random Chaman or Drood get fear into the fire², be curse, and dies.<br>
<br>
<br>
We are using fire prot. flask<br>
<br>
One groupe is north, chaman + totem | Drood @ Mt healing| Pally @ Disptach| Mage@decurse| Ranged dps.<br>
<br>
South: The same with healing melee.<br>
<br>
East: Without totem like West.<br>
<br>
<br>
There is problems on melee, west and east, do you think that we are bringing too much healers? <br>
If you guys have ideas it could be precious fo us. Thanks.<br>

		<div id="post_message_544821">Too many healers that can't move. Remember Pallies and Shaman can only heal when they're standing still. This is a fight where standing still is pretty much the root of all problems. Stack up on Priests/Druids for HoTs. When an Air Burst hits a group, a Priest can CoH it back up in mid air before the group even lands. Doomfire itself is horrible for Pally healers. What you want is heavy HoTs on the recipient so the healers can set and forget not losing a healer altogether until Doomfire goes away. If you're going to stack non-moving healers, at least choose Shaman so that you can get a bunch of Tremor Totems going.<br>
<br>
Honestly, I still think this fight is pretty broken and generally just not worth the time, but you can stack the fight in your favor at least.</div>

I don't think you read the thread because your setup sounds like a complete mess. A quick read of the thread will reveal fire prot. flask is useless, healer heavy raids (like 9 healers) are good, that you dont need to stack frost mages to compensate for poor strat/players.<br>

</div>Where was this 'random player' standing before the fear into the fire? If hes going with your strat of 'we are all around the boss' for positioning, maybe people are just standing too close or where-ever they feel like - and that will cause problems. Im assuming these players who die all have their fear trinkets on cooldown.. and that they were all standing 40+ yards from the doomfire and got feared in a direct straight line?

We just killed him tonight. And pretty much followed none of the strategies used here. No kiting. Basically a be smart and keep yourself alive strat. You run when doomfires come from you and make sure to not run them into the melee, but other than that we played it more risky. And even with that we barely made the timer. Killed him with about 5-6 second left on his enrage timer.</div>

My only complaint about the fight is how stupid fear as a mechanic is, expecially since this is a fight that encourages raid stacking to insane degreees.  I can only imagine how trivial this fight is with 5 shamans, and 5 shamans per 25 man raid is much worst than 8 warriors per 40 man raid, expecially on alliance side.<br>

		<div id="post_message_545200">Oh we used the 180 degree strat too, with our feral tanking him up against the hill. As a person who was in the group alongside the mountains, I felt it had certain advantages. One is the presence of the tree to my right provided a shield at times. Second is the massive amount of doomfires that spawned on our group, ran straight up into the mountains and died there. The 180 strat though does make it very hard for anyone in the two middle groups (non mountain side ones) to heal the MT though. So focus more MT healers there and focus more melee healers in the middle groups.</div>

		<div id="post_message_546459">Doomfires never turn more than 90 degrees at time (or so says my experience). I always run in a direction 90 degrees (or more) when to their "current heading" is "0 degrees".<br>
<br>
If doomfire follows you, dodge it. It doesn't matter if it follows you. Just dodge it again. As long as you don't close yourself in (should NOT happen) it doesn't matter where it goes or how long it follows you. I think 1 (or 2) healer(s) alone could keep tank up since Archimonde can't crush. Only thing to look out is that tank doesn't die during fears.<br>
<br>
It's better to spread out evenly and <u>focus on personal survival</u> than do some fancy tricks.<br>
<br>
I think there are max 3 doomfires up at any given time. If your side has 2-3 of them and it has boxed in people, the other 3 sides are completely free of doomfire. Thus it doesn't matter if few people are disabled by running around. Don't try to control doomfires. Unless someone gets grip, doomfire and airburst right after a fear (so no-one heals or decurses) and flies into well of eternity and thus gets a 30sec silence, they shouldn't die.</div>

		<div id="post_message_547087">I agree with recent posters.<br>
<br>
At first, our strategy, coming from these boards was something to the effect of "The doomfires are controllable, you can kite them away, they should never hit melee.  etc."<br>
<br>
We used a 4-point strat, and tried to get everyone to kite doomfires.  What ended up happening is doomfires would spawn between groups and start to curve.  People would be running back from air burst and move the direction of the doomfires.  The doomfires would just pick a direction no players were at, and start heading there.  This resulted in less than "Perfectly controlled" doomfires.  <br>
<br>
But moreover, it led to people blaming doomfires for their deaths.  If a doomfire looped around, rather than just deal with it, people started blaming kiters for themselves dying.  If a doomfire hit melee, it was pretty much a wipe. People died a fair bit to doomfires.  And a LOT of effort was expended trying, often in futility, to control the doomfires.  And they weren't doing what was so often described in this thread.<br>
<br>
When we moved our strategy from a kite-the-doomfire strategy, to a stay-alive strategy we did much better.  We moved to a 180 degree layout, which meant that there is a lot more crosshealing available.  In the 4 point strategy, each group was isolated.  Which meant that if you got separated from your group, or your healer was overwhelmed, you had no backups.  In the 180 degree strategy, group 2 could heal group 1,2 and 3 for instance, while group 3 could help with groups 2, 3 and 4.  <br>
<br>
Then doomfires became an annoyance rather than a death sentence.  Sure, people got hit by a doomfire, and after reading this thread, you would start to believe that guilds do it only by nobody getting hit by doomfire at all. But they're easily healed through, and while everyone is doing their best to avoid the doomfires, if you do get it, it's no big deal.  Increased crosshealing potential also meant that it is easier to keep everyone topped off.  This in turn leads to being able to survive pretty much any solitary soul charge.  Assuming you pop healthstones afterwards.<br>
<br>
I think those 2 things, being able to survive through occasional doomfires, and being able to stop a chain reaction when someone does die, by being prepared for the soul charge, are really what allowed us to defeat this encounter.  Not fancy doomfire kiting, or funky positioning.  And I think because of that, I think the encounter becomes a lot less "random" and a lot more repeatable.</div>

</div>Each ranged group has 2 healers. Since hitting doomfires is not too common, its hard for 2 healers (in a group of 5) to become overwhelmed. People ingroup shouldnt be the focus of heals, the MT should be.   If your getting 4-5 people in a group doomfired at the same time, its not your 'overwhelmed healers' thats the problem - its the players who stood too close to the fire in the first place. You don't need cross healing, really, when everyone plays properly - because people ingroup should require very little healing (occasionally single doomfire, or 3k airburst = nothing for 2 healers to handle) and all the healing therefore is focused on the MT.<br>
<br>

</div>we agree on that. <br>
<br>
I'm just trying to say that, don't expect nobody will get hit by a doomfire.  I'm saying expect people to get hit by doomfire occasionally.  Expect the doomfire to move incorrectly, despite best efforts to draw it away from Archimonde.  And be ready to keep people alive when they get doomfire.  Same with Soul Charge.  It may happen. Be prepared.<br>

All of this pandering to the crowd of people who can execute the strategy perfectly doesn't help a new guild learning the fight. <br>

</div>This is being patronizing.  Obviously when a doomfire is following you kite it away from Archimonde. That is common sense, and that is not what I'm talking about.  What I'm saying is when you're kiting it away and it decides to turn for no apparant reason, or maybe you get air bursted while you're kiting, or feared, or someone else runs too close and it changes target, or myriad other situations.  The doomfire will curve, it may run over itself or another DF and look as though it's passed, and then seem to fork out of a different DF before people are expecting it.   <br>
<br>
I'm just saying be ready for when DF does retarded things. Or hell, when players do retarded things. Because nobody is perfect.  And focus more on healing them up and keeping people alive, than playing the blame game when a doomfire arcs the wrong way for some unintelligible reason. <br>
<br>
Yes, when a DF is heading towards you, run straight out from archimonde, I would never debate that.  And if you can show me a video of doomfires following specific players in a straight line away from archimonde every go, and never hitting a person, I would be quite impressed.  But realistically in my experience, at least learning, people get hit by it. And it's more important IMO to be prepared to keep people alive, than to rely on everyone to perfectly kite the fires.  Best effort, yes.  Perfection? no.</div>

</div>Where are people getting the idea that a 4-point strat means doomfires somehow become perfectly 100% controllable into perfect straight lines? There has not been a single poster in this thread who has ever said 'We did archimonde tonight and every doomfire was a perfect straight line 100% of the time - try our strat!'.<br>
<br>
I think the misunderstanding comes from several posters who said, using 3/4point methods, things like 'our doomfire deaths went down a stunning amount' or 'doomfires are controllable' or 'removed doomfires as an issue from the fight completely' .   This is no way means  that suddenly all doomfires magically behaved exactly how they wanted, they still do have a random component and sometimes will cause problems - but overall - they can be managed more effectively.<br>
<br>
They still arc, move around, create problems etc , regardless of strat - but if you successfully pull the doomfire 50+% of its travel distance directly out from archimonde it should despawn by the time it reaches anyone else - and thats what a 4point strat is good at.<br>
<br>
All you really need to do is pull doomfires in a straight line when they follow you for, 50+% of their travel distance.  The direction they head after that should be somewhat irrelevant (theyd despawn by the time they get to any other groups).</div>

		<div id="post_message_547441">What I think Thorene is trying to say is that we stopped caring about kiting doomfires. We just individually dealt with them. If they were following us, we ran away. But if a doomfire ran right past us, then we stayed in. Staying in or not staying in seemed to have little difference for us in if they curled or not. Either way, they still curled. So you had times where a doomfire had run past you but you were alongside it healing the tank. Now people might say that is dangerous and that you risk having doomfires cross the raid, but they already happened anyway even with the 4 strat and trying to stay together as a group and run away. The benefits to this was that it was a lot easier to keep up the melee if something happened and the MT deaths dropped a lot.</div>

		<div id="post_message_547500">Tyrian, I don't think I'm arguing with you.  But given posts like Misao's on P34, and over the last few pages, there is a general sentiment that if someone is getting doomfire, it is a failure on the part of doomfire kiting.<br>
<br>
When we started making progress was when we shifted the blame away from the doomfire kiting.  We still attempted to draw the doomfires away when it targets you, rather than strafing or something which is going to ultimately cause more DF issues.  But we focused on individual responsibility.  If DF curves to melee, melee should move away.  What melee should not do is throw up their hands and say "Oh, we got doomfired, it was the kiters fault." or "Oh, bad luck, DF went totally random and melee got doomfired".  And if melee does get doomfired, then they use their tools to stay up.  Fire pots, Health stones, CloS.<br>
<br>
90% of the time if someone dies, it is their own fault.  People have a LOT of tools to keep themselves alive in this fight. <br>
<br>
My point is, if you're learning the fight, focus on survival foremost.  If everyone can survive being hit by a doomfire occasionally, and everyone can survive taking a soul charge occasionally, then if something unpredictable happens, everyone can deal with it. Once the survival issue is sorted out, then worry about kiting patterns.  Obviously we kite the doomfire away when it latches on to us.  But when we moved the focus from how to kite the doomfire, to how to stay alive, we went from 2 minute wipes to 6+ minute wipes almost immediately, and then a kill shortly after.</div>

I have a few questions about the 4 corners strategy you use.<br>
<br>
1.  How close are these groups?  We carry 3 shadow priests at most raids and I know they're going to want to mind flay (15 yds?).  Or is it not even worth their dps/time to get that close?<br>
2.  What is the fewest number of healers you will see on your MT at any given moment?  For instance if 3 groups are out due to "kiting" or blast, are you left with the resto druid in the middle and 2 healers from a corner group?<br>
3.  Shaman absolutely necessary in every corner group if we are horde?  We typically raid with 3 resto shaman and an enhancement shaman...Though we do have another resto shaman keyed if we found it necessary.<br>
4.  I've seen you post that you don't 1 shot this boss...So what causes the bulk of your wipes?<br>
<br>
After having been stuck on Kael for 2 months, we have enjoyed rather quick progress only raiding 3 nights a week, we've progressed to Archimonde and got Bloodboil last night(haven't tried RoS yet).  We've spent less than 2.5 hours wiping on each encounter while enjoying a 1 shot on Kazrogal and 2-4 shots on every other boss other than Bloodboil.  As raid leader, I'm looking for advice of what to set our guild up for for this boss.<br>
<br>
Thanks in advance for your assistance.</div>

1. This fght is 100% about survival. The enrage is easily done. As he does not tend to chain cast doomfires, the Spriests can just go in after he casts a doomfire away from them.<br>
2. We have had 1 healer for a short time and 2 healers usually on our MT. Depend son fears totem breaks etc. Archimonde hits fairly hard, but if people HoT up the MT before a fear and at least 1 person breaks it right away, you will be fine thanks to tremor totem breaks.<br>
3. Not necessary for any corner at all. Our first kill was with 3 shaman, our last with 1.<br>
4. You won't 1shot the boss because no matter what you do, doomfire has a random element. Someone might lag when clicking the tears of the goddess, so many things can happen to cause a single death and often a single death leads to more deaths which swiftly leads to a wipe. <br>
<br>
However we have seen similar progress in our raids that you have in yours. We beat Archimonde on our second full day of tries (3hr raids). Since then we have one shot him twice and 2 shot him once. I dont know why, but this fight just was not difficult for us. However we also got stuck on Kael for ages. Short raid times with that trash respawn timer was brutal =/.<br>
<br>
So it is not that you just will never one shot him. Its just that its not easy to. Just go in to the fight, have your decurses spread out. Have healers know what they have to do, who breaks fear etc and when. Have every person know what to do in case of a doomfire bearing down on them. Make sure they practice with the tears of the goddess off the cliffs near the woman who gives you the item. Bring consumeables, bring a fire prot potion couldron and hand out the pots and most importantly.. STAY ALIVE! You will probably find the fight like we did. Get the boss down to 60-80% on your first few tries. All you need to realise is that the first 10% is nearly the same as the middle 10% which is nearly the same as 30-20% etc. Nothing changes.</div>

I am convinced that a doomfire is 100% controllable and yet the lack of raid control leads to other impressions.

		<div id="post_message_548317">Just wanted to comment on the fight using a Druid MT.  My guild has killed Illidan 5 times now, with about 3 months of Archimonde experience.  We generally run 4-6 priests, had 4 in the raid tonight.  We tank a LOT of stuff with a druid.. generally saving our lone prot warrior for fights like Kael, Archimonde, RoS, Illidan, etc.  Our feral MT has always wanted to tank the fights that were designated warrior-only (I woulda loved to be part of a no-warrior Kael kill just to say we did it) and tonight he got his chance.<br>
<br>
First attempt.. about 15 seconds in he d/c'd.  Nearly survived until he came back too.. I think a healer finally pulled aggro with dps just standing idle.  Next attempt we get to 16% and a fear goes off with no fear ward up.  Druid gets hit in the back, feared into a fire and hit in the back again.. it was definitely a preventable death in that it WAS healable.. but <b>what do alliance guilds that have used a druid since day-1 do to counteract this[tank being feared]?  Or was the 30-second fear ward just ALWAYS up.. no one ever missed it and screwed up?</b><br>
<br>
We might go back to a warrior tanking, I don't know.  Having a tank with 23k hp who gets hit for 5.5-6.5k is REALLY nice though.. a huge change from warriors with 21k hp taking 9k hits.  Maybe just a little more coordination for our priests.. given that this was the first encounter they'd ever had fear ward for.</div>

</div>Basically, yes. <br>
Fear Ward needs to be always up, before the fear-targetting change - if your tank got feared it basically means he runs over to the next on aggro (not-feared) and one shots them.<br>
It wasn't really that hard with a 30 second FW.</div>

</div>Not true for me. I have had a doomfire right on my ass with no one else was in that frontal cone and seen it change direction. We seriously tried to do this at the start with concentrated kiting groups, but it didn't work because of the kite not working properly and one other thing. That being if you kited it, well you ended up being on average further away from archimonde. This led to more tank deaths due to healers not being in range (we had to put 1-2 healers on top of melee to counter this) plus the dreaded thing of doomfire spawns where a group has just kited theirs way back, has nothing in their frontal cone and swerves into melee or crosses the field.</div>

		<div id="post_message_548791">Here is what I suspect is the reason for the 4 corner strategy success.  Spreading out, but grouping at the same time.  You basically force 5 people to survive anytime there is an area in danger.  Something that is much less coordinated (albeit still doable)on the "spread out and hope you get decursed and/or healed and/or not feared through a flame when there isn't a healer nearby" strat. (I know I'm oversimplifying it, but you understand what I'm saying.)<br>
<br>
I have seen videos of alot of various styles and haven't seen a consistent "kiting" success.  But I have seen that there is less flame cluster with the 4 corner successes.  I can't explain why...I've just seen it help a little with making things less cluttered and chaotic.<br>
<br>
As I set up my raid tonight and explain the strat(our first night of attempts will be tonight), I'll not mention anything about kiting the flames so people don't assume or even hope that we'll kite them away.  I'll tell them that we can successfully kite 1 out of 10 away due to pure luck of the randomness.  I'm pretty sure that we'll get at least one to straight out or at least away and probably more.  But the main thing I'll preach to them is there is no guarantee on what the flames do, so figure out a way to protect yourself and stay alive..and the best way to do that is to hang with your group for healing and decursing.<br>
<br>
As for "kiting"....sounds like it's something that should not be said...especially to a new/fragile raid...maybe it works, maybe it doesn't.  Just figuring out ways to improve your survivability is the key imo.<br>
<br>
I could be wrong and if we go to Hyjal tonight, I'll post my assessment of how things go.<br>

I have a few questions about the 4 corners strategy you use.<br>
<br>
1. How close are these groups? We carry 3 shadow priests at most raids and I know they're going to want to mind flay (15 yds?). Or is it not even worth their dps/time to get that close?<br>
2. What is the fewest number of healers you will see on your MT at any given moment? For instance if 3 groups are out due to "kiting" or blast, are you left with the resto druid in the middle and 2 healers from a corner group?<br>
3. Shaman absolutely necessary in every corner group if we are horde? We typically raid with 3 resto shaman and an enhancement shaman...Though we do have another resto shaman keyed if we found it necessary.<br>
4. I've seen you post that you don't 1 shot this boss...So what causes the bulk of your wipes?
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>1) The groups are far apart on each of the four points and rarely get close enough to interact. Thus each group needs to be 100% fully self-sufficient with regards to heals/decursing etc.   Our shadow priests usually  dps in normal form the whole fight and never swap into shadow form. <br>
<br>
The best thing to do is assess your raid comp then decide. If your healing is a little weak - tell them to stay in normal form and help heal+dps. Or you could ask them to wear full healing gear. We have all our restro druids in full healing gear in range groups on decurse/heal duty for this fight too.<br>
<br>
2) Ya the restro druid + 2 on one side group is probably least - and should be enough. You might need to ask healers to trinket out of fears when this happens. Originally our rule was 'Never trinket out of a fear unless your in immediate danger' but after the patch we changed it slightly to 'healers can trinket out of a fear if its obvious theres not much MT healing at the time". Healers have to use common sense - if they can visably see that doomfirse have forced 50-75+% of the raid to run OOR of the MT, you might need to trinket.  The best healers to do this are obviously Paladins, since they can trinket but still have DI shield invulernability up if they are in danger afterwards.<br>
<br>
3) We've done it with 2 , 3 and 4 shamans. Obviously the more the better but having smart players is more important. We've had better Archimonde kills/raids with 2 shamans than we have had with 4 - simply because new players can mess up other parts of the fight. Still naturally, you want to bring as many shamans as you have available (as long as they dont lag/crater/die easily). So no - its not required on the outer corners. All you need to do is make sure that particular group without them knows they have to be extra careful and when a fear is incoming, they are at least 30-40+ yards away from any doomfires so if they get feared it will (Hopefully) run out by the time they run the travel distance towards one.<br>
<br>
4) Most of our wipes are caused by the (Infuriating) stupid mistakes that just one person has to do each attempt to start the wipe chain (Crater, "oops, i laggged when I clicked my tear", stand near to a doomfire and get feared into it) Legitimate wipe reasons (parry gibbage and all healers feared/oor-&gt;mt dying) still come second to player-stupid mistakes causing wipes - at least for us anyway. <br>
<br>
Hope that helps, anything else? Pls let us know how u went on ur initial attempts and what success/problems you had, im eager to hear <br>
<br>
<br>
- The only change I made to our 4point strat for 2.3 in light of the FW change was this: The melee group now must have a Shaman<b>+Pally</b> in it(we used Ret, but holy/prot would be fine too)! I shifted one of the usual melee (Preferably fury warrior, because they can break their own fears) out of the melee-group to make room for him. Heres why we needed to do this..<br>
<br>
The Resto druid standing on melee is very close to Archimonde, but not in a Shaman group and therefore has no Fear protection. This is a huge risk which needs to be fixed. There are a couple ways to do it but we did the following:<br>
====<br>
a - Melee Group Enhancement shaman gets a permenant FW rotation so he can Insta-tremor totem protect the melee group  (and trinkets if theres no fw available)<br>
b - FEAR - Tremor totem ticks and the melee group gets dispelled almost instantly.<br>
c - Ret Pally (after being tremor totemed out of fear) immediately dispels the Restro Druid - who stands on the melee but isnt actually in a shaman group<br>
d- Ret Pally attempts to dispel anyone else who is in range for the next few seconds , before returning to DPS.<br>
<br>
B-&gt;D happens very fast (within 1-2 seconds) but basically its just a failsafe to keep your resto druid alive and works well if your Shaman/Pally have fast fingers. This fixes the melee-restro-druid fear problem quite well.<br>
<br>
If you dont have a ret pally, you can just as easily put a Holy Paladin on the melee to do this job. But since a ret pally is dps, it works out well. (Assuming you have 8-9 good healers elsewhere) This would have the added bonus of him being able to get tremored out of feared to spam the MT. Yes, its not normal to have a DPS warrior kicked out of the melee group (And shoved into any random range groups) but it doesnt matter - as everyone said - Archimonde is not a dps fight so the usual dps-group-stacking rules dont apply.</div>

If someone is over-topped the tank on threat but under the 10/30% pulling margin, the boss will re-evaluate based on threat and go kill that target rather than chase the feared tank.<br>

		<div id="post_message_549703">We had few tries where he simply killed MT right on the pull, though that had to be some absurd parry chain. Without debuffs, it's 8k+ for us. Combined with possible Doomfire under a tank and Doomfire/fear/airburst around healers, it adds up fairly fast and can lead to some nasty spikes. I'm kinda tempted to use Feral now, though running around in Fear seems to be quite risky - won't he Burst tank if he runs too close to melee and won't reposition in time? Or was there some cooldown between Fear and Burst?<br>
Though, now that I have Fear Ward, it's much better, combined with Trinket that's basically 2/3 fears negated, maybe more, depending on his cooldown.</div>

</div>There's a significant gotcha here - you need to verify the date the movie was made. Most Archimonde videos were taken prior to the patch which significantly increased the spawn rate of the doomfire.

</div>It's important to note that, although we killed Illidan 5 weeks ago, our more recent main tank was sporting tier 5 and karazhan gear and I believe one tank piece from black temple, which is what Latito's numbers were based off of. We had a nearly full t6 warrior for our first Illidan kill who gquit, a t5 cross-server warrior who quit the game 2 weeks ago, and currently another cross-server t5 warrior.  For a while we had someone logging on our t5 warrior for the sole purpose of tanking the two shield required fights (and fear fights until this week).  With that bit of information it's a little easier to see why our warrior would take such terrible damage and why we're so quick to put a t6 tank druid on Archimonde now that we're able.  <br>
<br>
Blizz took a good step in giving priests a universal Fear Ward -- is it so much to give druids a Shear Ward? (Sorry for the pun )<br>
<br>
Edit: 4 priests is obviously sufficient, I'm suspecting a shadow priest was reluctant to shift out and use his...</div>

		<div id="post_message_549888">For sure, Lim.  We both know our warriors were/are under geared, especially compared to our druids, especially yourself.  Using a druid tank for our guild is certainly the easier strat, I'm just confirming how to minimize the possible pitfalls of a non-warrior tank.<br>
<br>
If its simply a matter of keeping fear ward up, nothing special (which makes sense.. didn't think I'd missed something obvious).. then our priests will just have to get things going right next week.  Still.. first ever fear-ward encounter for the guild and they get us to 16% (and we still didn't wipe!).. pretty damn good.</div>

</div>At the risk of saying the obvious - why bother - even if this works its clearly unintended and one of those things they will hotfix anyway. The intended design is having doomfires an important mechanic that need to be managed/avoided, not something you cut off with terrain/water/world tree and essentially remove them from the fight entirely. Itd be like Chrommaggus with the old LOS positioning which negated any affect his breaths had on the fight and being to dps the whole time whilst avoiding them.</div>

		<div id="post_message_552565">If your main healers are all in this little boat and there's only one air burst, it should be a perfect wipe, shouldn't it? And a lot of your dps should be running a lot of time with only 180° to spare.<br>
<br>
Using fear ward on a feral sounds like a very solid strat to me. Giving your tank a shaman with agi totem should push him over 50% dodge, compared with armor cap he shouldn't die regulary.<br>
<br>
Well, we don't run with that much priests, leaving us only the warrior tanking way. Last week we advised our non-tremor groups (running with 2-3 shaman regulary) to run out of fear range with a fire near them and it really helped a lot. You will lose 1 decurse, heal and 2-3 dps for a while but the can't die to an unlucky doomfire/airburst combination. Of course, this makes the fight a bit longer, but we prefer the control.</div>

Last kill on wednesday, we were 3 priests and we actually put FW on a holy priest who mass dispelled.<br>

The big change for me seems to be that you just have to deal with Fear now, and can't nullify it on some groups anymore. However if you killed him before a few times, it's not that big of a deal, in my opinion.<br>

It actually has a positive effect. People run away earlier and farther instead of standing still in place, which does help with doomfire paths and makes it less dangerous.</div>

		<div id="post_message_555759">We had our second night of wipes yesterday. I pretty much hate this encounter already. In terms of bad design there is probably one thing that didn´t get mentioned here explicit before, but i personally hate most. The doomfire trail animation is much bigger than the area that really hurts you. Mostly the last third of the trail doesn´t seem to do any damage. I noticed this when trying to die from fire as we were clearly wiping and i didn´t manage to get burned down. I personally think a little change in the design would make a real difference in the randomness of this encounter, as you literally have much more space than the burning area seems to pretend. Usually the whole place is covered by fire, but only 2/3 of them do really hurt. But if you missed to follow the whole path of the fire, you cannot say if the fire in front of you is hurtful or just decoration. Also in terms of graphical encounter design this just makes no sense, if there is fire it should hurt, can´t understand why there is fire that doesn´t hurt.</div>

</div>Remember - having agro on a mob doesnt necessarily mean you have the highest threat on it. <br>
<br>
In your case, a melee had higher threat than the main tank, even if only by the slighest amount (101% - 109% of MT threat).  Because the only person who cant get targeted from airbust is highest threat - this rogue became excempt from targetting and the MT suddenly became a legitimate target. <br>
<br>
You don't want this to happen - you want to ensure that the current agro holder = main tank = highest person on threat for Archimonde. Usually this is easy, but if melee dps too hard - they will be able to mess things up.</div>

</div>The player could have been lagging/spiked when theres an airbust? Since character position is client side he might have *appeared* to be dead mid-air, but the server actually had his character hit the ground (and die) at that moment. It would only take a second or two of lag to do this (because your character falls very fast), so you should check with that player if he experienced any lag/lockups around the time he got airbusted.    Ill have a closer look at the wws after my raid.<br>

</div>If your the MT and you got <i>targetted </i>for an airbust, one of your players (usually the melee) is too high on threat -. Tell them to watch omen and hover around a much safer % to avoid spike agro (eg windfury crits) pushing them up over 100% of MT threat instantly. I believe most of our melee like to hover between 80-90% of MT threat for this reason. The reason it 'never happened before' is simply chance. Theres 24 people in the raid who can be targetted for airbust and the MT is 1 of them (when melee get higher threat). So its just a 1/24 chance your MT will actually be a target for airbust and thus isnt likely to happen that often, even if your melee get too high on threat - but it <i>can </i>happen.</div>

</div>Assuming no one else was in range of him, and aggro was not an issue, then it was indeed a bug.<br>
<br>
We have seen this bug once.  <br>
<br>
I was trying to anti-kite archimonde, standing right inside him, melee were far away from me, no one in range.  <br>
<br>
He targetted me for air burst.  Roughly 10 people in the raid, spread out over 200 yards got hit by the 3000 damage from the air burst, but only I at the center of the boss got flung.  We wiped cause I tried to intercept, and I got one of those "hey lets use the intercept cooldown up and go nowhere bugs".  Was basically a lot of fun.  I think Thezilch has this on a combat log somewhere if people (as always) don't believe this, until of course they see it themselves.  <br>
<br>
You will likely not see that bug again, and it was probably even more likely someone just ran into your MT, or aggro was a concern.</div>

After 1 fear or so he gets directly targeted for the Air Burst and flies to the mountain, don't know did some melee overnuke but I doubt that. Anyways, he survives and the raid moves closer, packing up way too much. We lose 1 shaman and 1 lock to fall damage and doomfire, but we still survived the silence. Then MT misses a fear but fear breaks or gets dispelled before any big harm happens.  The next fear is also missed by the MT who says he is "lagging", and he runs 30 yards next to the mountain, through multiple doomfires, Archi beating him while fear not breaking. Raid repositions again, and we manage to kill it in the end. Before 2.3 this would have been guaranteed wipe.</div>

		<div id="post_message_558003">We haven't killed Archimonde yet so I wanted to ask for some help.<br>
I didn't take part in the first two raids, only listened in teamspeak, so forgive me if I can't tell you all details.<br>
However, on those two nights we tried the 'spread out' tactic, where the raid positioned itself in a circle all around Archimonde. It was a happy whipefeast, but they managed to get him down to like 26% in the second night (last try of course).<br>
<br>
Now the next raid week, I take part in the encounter and I proposed to try the 4 corner strategy, which seems to have a great impact on survability and an increase on control over the random factors in the fight. However, in the two hours that were left on our schedule for that night (we are visiting him again tomorrow), it was a mere catastrophe. People still died, people still weren't decursed or healed, the doomfires went straight to the melees or from group 1 to group 2 etc.<br>
Also there may have already been answered several of my questions in this thread, but with the changes done to the boss and a 36 pages thread, it is quite difficult to a) find the answer and b) be able to find out if it is not already outdated.<br>
<br>
I'd like some advice for this tactis, as I feel the main problems were due to doomfire handling.<br>
1) How far away from Archimonde do the ranged groups stand, before a doomfire spawns?<br>
2) What angle do the doomfires have on for 'locking up' on one target? I've read 60° in this thread, and 60° basically means an isosceles triangle (sic?), which does leaves some unpopulated space between the groups, e.g. on certain spawn points, there is no player in range for the doomfire to lock on.<br>
3) How tight together do the groups themselves position? All on top or more loosely (I proposed to stand almost on top of each other, but when I observed the groups more closely during these tries, I had to find out that they were more or less cluttered)?<br>
4) Do you immediatley run away from the doofmire or do you wait until it has closed up a bit?<br>
<br>
Some of co-officers stated that there is one major drawback of this tactis. Although it *should* encourage the dispellers/healers to focus solely on their own group, there are still some people (slackers) who just can't handle the simplest things (which exactly this is - dispel only your group, heal only your group (despite the main tank of course)). I appreciate all this, and I cannot understand how one could fail in doing so, but obviously there are a few people how are great in pushing one button for 5 minutes and are doing great on DPS, but when it comes to movement or fast reaction (decursing), they just fall behind.<br>
And this is the key point in this tactic. If in one group, there is such a slacker as our decurser or primary healer, you have no backup. In the 'all around - wherever you like' tactic, most times there is an above-average player available to compensate the weakness of another player. In a four corner tactic, there isn't. If the decurser is brain-afk, simply lagging, and the player affected by the debuff also just stupid, it's a whipe. This is especially bad if you don't have enough players online to simply switch them and you have to stick to what's available.<br>
<br>
The raid was terrifying. I don't know if it was due to that we were at the end of the night and were all a bit uncentrated (gone through all of Hyjal for the first time within one day, the raid was great up until Archimonde, all bosses were cleard on the first try), if it was the sudden change of tactics that overstrained our players, the not-so-optimal setup for Archimonde (a bit too less healers and two shamans), or if the players available simply sucked (which is someway possible, but seeing that we cleared all of the bosses without much problems in that night, kind of hard to believe).<br>
<br>
Tomorrow we will have a full day available only for Archimonde, and I'd like to give some infos and tips before we try him, mainly the questions I asked above. After some tries I even ordered to melees to back off completely and assigned them to ranged groups, to maybe make it easier for the ranged groups to somehow control the doomfire, which didn't bring much success. They still went in circles, from group A to B, etc.<br>
<br>
<br>
Thank you for help. I'm strongly suggesting tomorrow that we continue to train four corners, but if we don't see much improvement, there is not much we can do but to go back to the more chaotic spread out tactic, which I'd really dislike.</div>

</div>The first thing you should do is remove these people from the raid. It might seem obvious, but running with 23 competant players is much better than running with 25 including 2 clueless players. There is no shame in saying 'Either improve or get out of the raid'. If you want to try to attempt archimonde with people who cant think or make the stupidiest of mistakes continually, then expect stupid wipes.<br>
<br>
To answer your questions..<br>
<br>
1 ) The range groups stand at max range from doomfires before they spawn. The exceptions to this might be shadow priests (who have to run in to fear ward) and mages (who might have to run in and help with a decurse).<br>
2) Not sure<br>
3) The groups are tight enough so that they all get airbusted together. Airbust is ~10 yard radius iirc, so everyone stands that close - just say to literally stand on top of each other, that makes it easiest to explain to your raid.<br>
4) Run immediately if it spawns in front of you. After you start running turn around around and see if its following you - if not , it might be safe to return to your original position. Thats what we do anyway.<br>

				Although it *should* encourage the dispellers/healers to focus solely on their own group, there are still some people (slackers) who just can't handle the simplest things (which exactly this is - dispel only your group, heal only your group (despite the main tank of course)). I appreciate all this, and I cannot understand how one could fail in doing so, but obviously there are a few people how are great in pushing one button for 5 minutes and are doing great on DPS, but when it comes to movement or fast reaction (decursing), they just fall behind.

</div>Just to re-iterate. No strategy is going to help you unless you first help yourself and first make sure you have competant players in the raid and remove the ones who just 'dont get it' after giving everyone a fair chance to learn and understand the strategy - then execute it.<br>
<br>
Spread your competant players around and make sure each group leader with a symbol is a very competant player. Make sure your decursers and healers know exactly what role they have. Tell mages that all curses on their group should be dispelled within 1-2 seconds, sometimes before it even ticks once. Tell healers that anyone in their group who needs a heal is their top responsibility to top them up fast (then return to the MT). Tell players that get lost or easily confused with positioning that ALL the have to do is follow their group leader.  If none of that helps - find another player and invite them to the raid instead.</div>

		<div id="post_message_558368">Hm, we somehow mixed the two tactics now. I.e. the groups do not necessarily stand together all of the time, but the general consensus for them is to find together once they were separated, due to whatever.<br>
Additionally of course we specifically tried to set up the raid for Archimonde with 9 healers.<br>
<br>
Well it seems to have worked, if one of the group's healer/decurser didn't react in time, there were others in range that could take over their role.<br>
After about 2 hours we finally killed him.<br>
The doomfires didn't behave much worse than in the night where we tried the 4 corners, but I blame this that it wasn't executed properly.<br>
<br>
I just hope that this wasn't only a lucky try. We'll see next week.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">We finally started working on Archi last night and got it to 34% on our best attempt. But some strange thing has happened at 36%, our MT got air burst. Not a scenario where air burst is cast on melee and they did not react fast, MT is literally the target of the air burst, and he was clearly on top of aggro list.<br>
<br>
Is this a known bug? <br>
Is he acting like Capernican; sending a fireball after conflagrate? In archi's case, choosing MT as his next target to air burst after putting grip on an another player?</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>We have seen this happen 3 times.  Raid warning pops up that our MT is targeted with Air Burst (not a melee who got too close) and then he goes flying.<br>
<br>
Unless our threat meter was completely off, no one was even CLOSE to the MT in threat, so I doubt it was a threat issue.  I personally think it is what you describe: he turns and casts grip on player X, and then while he is casting grip, the MT becomes a valid target for air burst for a very short period of time.</div>

</div>On a similar note - be aware that from our experience he NEVER casts fear if someone is affected by Airburst. Ever. Our Shaman can drop the totem on the button nearly every time by watching this. There could be a similar mechanic in place for Soul Charge.</div>

</div>One detail I should've added was the entire ranged group that was in front of it just got air bursted. We run a 3 ranged group system and everyone sticks together and takes the burst. Could it be that the doomfire was targeting someone who had just gotten bursted, realized it was out of range, and picked the next one closest to range, in this case, melee?</div>

</div>This is extremely rare, for us at least.<br>
<br>
 From observation it appears to be more likely to happen when the usually-closest range groups are currently far away (running from doomfire or just airbusted). If it happens 'every pull' then something is terribly wrong with the raid positioning and setup. I dont think the doomfire is actually going 'for the melee' but actually going for ranged/healers on the opposite side of Archimonde.<br>
<br>
 I think that when a doomfire spawns it targets a close-by person in a frontal cone initially, who is at a a <i>minimum distance </i>and travels towards them. All melee/mt are excluded from this initial targetting as they are within the minimum distance. So if a doomfire spawns and nobody is in front of it in this frontal cone (aka that group was just airbusted) it might instead target the closest person who is at least say 15 yards from Archimonde  - on the opposite side. As it travels towards them it travels directly over the melee. So you could say the doomfire isnt actually going 'for the melee' but rather its going for the closest person on the opposite side of archimonde and the melee just happen to be in the way.<br>
<br>
This would mean that melee/mt are <i>never</i> initial targets for a fresh doomfire spawn - but it doesnt mean a doomfire won't head over them upon spawning if the situation you described happens. However it should be a rare occurance.</div>

</div>I've never seen this, but what I *have* seen and has given us plenty of trouble, is fires moving out toward some ranged, then losing their lock and choosing a new target on the other side of Archi, thus making a big circle around the melee, trapping them at the next fear, or else straight across the melee.<br>
<br>
We've tried telling our ranged to never try to ditch the flame and just lead it straight away from Archi until it despawns, but this has its own problems: either the flame kiter goes alone, gets cursed and dies way out of range of decurses, or his whole group has to go with him, which takes them all out of the fight and then dps or healing is insufficient.</div>

I also had pretty good results with a macro /assist Archimonde /cast decursespell (the hunters loved it for their pets), i even wanted to try this out with someone more or less solo-decursing standing in melee range, but as we had our kills with enough decursers I didn´t try so far.

</div>He only targets the person for a fraction of a second, was this macro reliable? It seems as if you would be sacrificing a significant number of people to only mashing one button to catch all curses in this kind of situation, leaving the decurse-er with very little else to do or able to contribute.  Is there more to the macro that allows for the casting of a basic spell in the case that Archimonde has not cursed somebody?<br>
<br>
I am not saying this will not work, I am just curious as to how you implement this in a (I do not know your Archi strat) fairly standard 5 groups (melee, 4 ranged) setup on archimonde without simply having 5 people only hitting one button and still managing to get all the heals (and damage) needed to complete the fight.</div>

</div>Once your raid believes in average ranged DPS with survival being the most important part of this fight, Doomfires should rarely be an issue anyway. I bring Greater Fire Protection potions (the ones people used for Rags) because they're much cheaper than Super Healing potions and really the only source of damage I need healing from ever. That's only in the very rare circumstances I am forced into a Doomfire w/o a trinket up. New Doomfire forms right after a Fear, etc. The FR pots are also immensely useful for Az'galor.</div>

		<div id="post_message_569265">I mentioned it a little earlier, but (for us) I expect a typical ranged DPS to do between 200-600 DPS on archimonde. Sometimes if your unlucky with doomfire/airbust, a DPS might do less damage than the protection warrior MT'ing = which is perfectly fine. Ive consistently seen in our setup (4 ranged + melee) that 50-60% of total damage to Archimonde comes from that single melee group. Our most recent Archimonde kill was 8 minutes (9 healers): <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302183149/http://wowwebstats.com/huju2ro444fxy?s=11180-11661" target="_blank">Wow Web Stats</a> <br>
<br>
We actually use 6 melee + restro druid in centre. Five melee form a single group, this includes 3 rogues+ 1 shaman+ 1ret pally. There is also a fury warrior in the raid but he is in another group since he can break his own fear. When the melee group (aka ret pally) gets tremor totem'd out of fear, he immediately dispels the fear from the restro druid (whos in the MT group without a totem).  If I didnt have the ret pally available for the raid I would put a holy paladin in the melee group to do the same job. The sequence of events (shaman tremor totem dispels ret paladin -&gt; ret paladin dispels resto druid on melee) happens very fast, within 1-2 seconds.<br>
<br>
As I explained to a new mage yesterday joining us for his first archimonde kill, "Our job is to dance with archimonde for 10 minutes, let the melee do the dps'.</div>

</div>Short answer = yes. Decrusing is still 'everyones responsibility' but the druid is the best person to do it , due to his central raid- positioning with the melee and being in range of alot more of the raid than one of the four corner groups (if you use a 4 point setup). The benefits to having a resto druid in the centre include:<br>
<br>
- Melee <i>always </i>have a decurser in range , even when they get airbusted (since they get airbusted with the druid , who stands on top of them.  This is good because you never know when mages/range groups have to run off or get airbusted away out of range)<br>
- MT always has a decurser in range, regardless of whether mages have been airbusted/had to run off.<br>
- Druids are excellent with hots to keep alive melee with multiple doomfires ticking if you have a nasty doomfire/fear<br>
- Druid can keep constant hots on MT to help compensate for all the moving the other 7-8 healers have to do<br>
- The druid is in the centre of the raid and thus in range of alot of the raid to help decurse/heal where needed, but his top priority is looking after melee/mt decursing and melee doomfire healing.<br>
<br>
With all these benefits - I think its silly not to use a restro druid in the centre standing on the melee. I would suggest fear control as the way I mentioned a few posts up (ret/holy pally in melee group manually dispels resto druid). <br>
<br>
Lastly, <i>all </i>the fear wards from the raid go onto the melee group Enhancement shaman. This ensures he can drop his tremor totem instantly when a fear goes off to tremor-dispel his ret paladin ASAP, who in turn gets the druid a split second later with a cleanse-dispel. If you decide to do this, make sure your paladin realises how important the need is to be FAST on the dispel, immediately as a fear goes off the Paladin needs to be spamming cleanse on the druid.</div>

</div>Felguards don't work on Archimonde. Who wants to heal a pet with the amount of stuff going on in this fight? Melee always end up eating Doomfires. Just not possible. I always use an Imp here. Ranged DPS are just not that important. Melee are the real winners (and good for them) here.</div>

		<div id="post_message_570464">We've spent 2 nights on Archimonde so far, with our best result being 39% using a 4-corners (sorta) strategy. Our melee are surviving fairly well at this point, and we're using what Fear Wards we have on our enh shaman, who cleanses his whole group.<br>
<br>
Our doomfire control is absolute shite. I have no clue how it could be so bad, but it didn't matter what we did, or where ... doomfire would loop and twist and loop and come back in on the melee and basically screw us over in any circumstance it could.<br>
<br>
We tried a couple of things:<br>
<br>
1) Put all ranged behind Archimonde. In this case, fire spawned wherever, and looped in the area we had assigned. Rarely did it actually "aggro" on someone and kite out in a straight line ... most of the time it went 10' out, then cut back in and around and in fun heart-shaped patterns.<br>
2) 4 corner strat. In this case, we found that the first 2-3 fires would always spawn behind the MT, blocking off one area. This group would move, and from there it was just fires all over the place, no reason. There was rarely more than 90 degrees free of fire at one point. I think we had up to 5 fires up at one point, just chain-spawning every 8 seconds. <br>
<br>
Basically, what we want to know is ... (and I know this question has been addressed before in the thread, although no-one gave a definitive answer that I saw):<br>
<br>
Is the doomfire in any way, shape, or form controllable? That is, does it spawn with guaranteed aggro on SOME ranged person, and can thus be kited for 10 seconds straight out, away from the boss? If so, does it spawn on the side of the boss that that person is on?<br>
<br>
We've seen doomfire spawn behind the MT, loop around instantly, go through the melee and out the other side heading for someone random at the other side of the raid. We've seen it go straight out into nowhere-land with absolutely no target whatsoever, then pick a target 10 seconds later and start going straight for them. We've seen basically every combo possible. <br>
<br>
I watched two videos; one by a guild on our server that seemed to go with the a semi-group strategy, and attempt to avoid the fires, and the second by Transcended, who either had some ninja-haxx-sk1lz, or were the luckiest people I've ever seen. <br>
<br>
Can anyone explain why (video: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302180616/http://www.warcraftmovies.com/download.php?id=42447&amp;mirror=1" target="_blank">Transcended Vs. Archimonde</a>) over 80% of the fires spawning in this video spawn behind the MT, and wander off into that half of the map, where no-one is standing? I'd really love to be able to do this when we go back to play with Archimonde ... <br>
<br>
We've got decursing under control, we've got melee group under control and they're doing nice dps. We've got tank healing mostly covered thanks to extra FWs and trinkets and pally bubbles. It's just the ranged dps and doomfires we cannot seem to solve. <br>
<br>
Any suggestions?<br>
<br>
As a complete aside, where does everyone tank him? We've been engaging from directly behind him, and tanking him about 15' from the stump back along the path toward where he spawns. This ends up leaving some healers in and amongst the trees over there, but provides a ton of space for the people behind him.</div>

		<div id="post_message_570473">Regarding doomfire, my guild has always found it best to have everyone in that sector (We use 4 corners also) move straight back if a fire is moving towards them. By moving straight back it's almost guaranteed that fire will remain in a semi-straight line and will not twist and loop through your raid. <br>
<br>
Do you lose out on a lot of healing and dps time by having an entire sector move back? Yes! But is worth it. The entire fight is about survivability and controlling doomfire properly will make for a much smoother kill. <br>
<br>
As far as the 'AI' for the fires is concerned it seems to have some sort of set pattern after it chooses its initial random target. It will follow its initial random target until that person either runs in a new direction or dies. If the person who gets targeted off the start just runs straight back, the fire should follow them perfectly but if they decide to make an attempt to 'dodge' the doomfire it will instead choose a new target in it's vicinity. Which will lead to the fire looping happily through your raid.<br>
<br>
Note: This is only from my experience and could be completely wrong .</div>

</div>But thats the whole fight!   Your constant use of 'behind' the MT leads me to believe your setting up your raid poorly - even if you are using '4 groups'. How exactly are there 4 groups positioned? It sounds like you have archimonde against the mountain with 4 groups like this:<br>
<br>
---1<br>
2<br>
---boss<br>
3<br>
---4<br>
<br>
The pic above is a bad 4-point setup open to many problems. Instead should try the setup below:<br>
<br>
1-------2<br>
<br>
--boss<br>
<br>
3-------4<br>
<br>
Try that instead. If you spread the raid/ranged/healers evenly around the boss, there is no 'behind' or 'in front of the mt' really - it doesnt matter where doomfires spawn as the raids effectively split up into 4 self-sufficient groups who can react and function independantly of each other.<br>
<br>
You could not have '5 fires up at one point'. There are 2 doomfires up at a given time and the third doomfire spawns <i>just </i> as the first doomfire begins its despawn (which takes several seconds). So you really only have 2 active doomfires at a given time.<br>

</div>Short Answer: Yes<br>
<br>
Long Answer: Sortof. The doomfires appear to have a 'follow a player' component and a 'move in random direction' component and alternate between them at will. Thats why you see some doomfires obviously-following players and others mindlessly going off into the distance. You can, therefore, control the doomfires when they are following a player. You do this usually by kiting the doomfire away from archimonde (depending on your guilds strat) while it follows you. <br>
<br>
Remember, NO STRAT can claim it has 100% control of doomfires and makes them all shoot off harmlessly in the distance, they do appear to have a random component in their movement too. No matter what strat you decide to run with, there will be times where a doomfire does something unexpected and might head towards other players. All you need to do is keep calm and immediately say on vent 'Group 4, watch out - doomfire coming from your left' - or similar - so they can move away safely.</div>

		<div id="post_message_570478">So do you have each sector clumped up completely? We were spreading out a little bit in some sectors to avoid sending multiple healers sailing into the distance; maybe that's part of the problem.<br>
<br>
Has anyone successfully used a 4-corner strat that had people slightly spread out, or are all of them dependent on having all 5 people in that group clumped within 3' of each other?<br>
<br>
As well, you most definitely *can* have more than 3 fires up at a time. I saw it tonight. Repeatedly. Maybe not 5 (one would be despawning), but there were at least 4 up on one of our wipes. We were seeing them spawn as often as every 6 seconds at times, which leads to a lot of fire and not much space to keep them in.<br>
<br>
From conversation with one of the other guilds on our server that has killed him, current theory on Doomfire from them is that it can spawn any time he's not doing anything else, based off the GCD. So if he's casting Fear, or Grip, or Air Burst, he cannot cast Doomfire within 1.5 seconds of that. Other than that, it's completely random ... he uses the ability, when it's up, if he can. Here comes another fire. <br>
<br>
Also, our 4-point strategy is just that ... 4 points. One group directly in front of Archimonde, one behind, one at his left, one at his right. It made a diamond shape, until fire distorted it.</div>

</div>Well thats your problem. The idea of a 4-point strategy is 4 POINTS. Not four 'areas where groups spread out liberally' - 4 very defined points where the entire group stands together.<br>
<br>
Four tight groups who together form a point spaced around Archimonde. That group stands together, on top of each other, runs out together when in danger, runs in together when safe, strafes together when necessary - and does everything else together. <br>
<br>
Spreading out is what causes the problems. Of course, theres many ways to approach the fight and strat - other guilds do spread out - some stay compact, find what works for you. In my experience, sticking together is the key to doomfire management.</div>

</div>We try to promote spreading out in your sector as much as possible while still being in range of your decurser. This helps prevent entire groups from getting launched in the air at the same time. Also I hope your entire raid has at least 1 stack of Major Fire Protection Potions to use for when someone inevitably gets hit with doomfire.</div>

</div>The more important thing to remember is: nothing you describes is a legitimate reason to cause a wipe. If that doomfire was heading towards those players - simply warn them so they run off = simple. In our raids, its the responsibility of the Group closest to the doomfire to warn on vent when it changes direction and heads towards other unsuspecting groups. <br>
<br>
Its easy to play devils advocate and say scenarios like "What if the doomfire spawns at A, cut across towards B but suddenly went to D and killed in everyone in its path".

		<div id="post_message_570497">The spreading out within the zones was the key problem, I think. I've drastically modified our strat, and I'm basically going to hammer the following mantra into our ranged dps' heads: "THE MELEE KILL THE BOSS. THE MELEE KILL THE BOSS. THE MELEE KILL THE BOSS." until they believe it. Right now, they seem to think they're heroes for dodging a doomfire and going back to dps'ing, not realizing that all they're doing is causing the doomfire to loop around and screw someone else. We have always had a very strong ranged dps crew who pride themselves on pushing up toward rogue range (rogues @ 1500, ranged @ 1350+ for our best), and they're going to have to learn that this is NOT a fight where they can do this.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the help; I'll post again when we get back into Hyjal and have another shot at this punk. It's a frustrating fight so far; I can do my job flawlessly, avoid the fires, heal the tanks, and 2 random nubs will wipe the raid.</div>

</div>It seems to me like<br>
<br>
- Archimonde chooses a random player not in melee range.<br>
- A fire spawns on the same side as that player and heads towards them.<br>
- If the player runs backwards, it just moves in a straight line.<br>
- If the player runs sideways, the fire soon turns and becomes quite unpredictable.<br>
<br>
it will probably stay as one of those things with a mystery element to it though, like onyxia deep breath :&gt;</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Our doomfire control is absolute shite. I have no clue how it could be so bad, but it didn't matter what we did, or where ... doomfire would loop and twist and loop and come back in on the melee and basically screw us over in any circumstance it could.<br>
<br>
We tried a couple of things:<br>
<br>
1) Put all ranged behind Archimonde. In this case, fire spawned wherever, and looped in the area we had assigned. Rarely did it actually "aggro" on someone and kite out in a straight line ... most of the time it went 10' out, then cut back in and around and in fun heart-shaped patterns.<br>
2) 4 corner strat. In this case, we found that the first 2-3 fires would always spawn behind the MT, blocking off one area. This group would move, and from there it was just fires all over the place, no reason. There was rarely more than 90 degrees free of fire at one point. I think we had up to 5 fires up at one point, just chain-spawning every 8 seconds. <br>
<br>
Basically, what we want to know is ... (and I know this question has been addressed before in the thread, although no-one gave a definitive answer that I saw):<br>
<br>
Is the doomfire in any way, shape, or form controllable? That is, does it spawn with guaranteed aggro on SOME ranged person, and can thus be kited for 10 seconds straight out, away from the boss? If so, does it spawn on the side of the boss that that person is on?<br>
<br>
We've seen doomfire spawn behind the MT, loop around instantly, go through the melee and out the other side heading for someone random at the other side of the raid. We've seen it go straight out into nowhere-land with absolutely no target whatsoever, then pick a target 10 seconds later and start going straight for them. We've seen basically every combo possible. <br>
<br>
I watched two videos; one by a guild on our server that seemed to go with the a semi-group strategy, and attempt to avoid the fires, and the second by Transcended, who either had some ninja-haxx-sk1lz, or were the luckiest people I've ever seen. <br>
<br>
Can anyone explain why (video: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302180616/http://www.warcraftmovies.com/download.php?id=42447&amp;mirror=1" target="_blank">Transcended Vs. Archimonde</a>) over 80% of the fires spawning in this video spawn behind the MT, and wander off into that half of the map, where no-one is standing? I'd really love to be able to do this when we go back to play with Archimonde ... <br>
<br>
We've got decursing under control, we've got melee group under control and they're doing nice dps. We've got tank healing mostly covered thanks to extra FWs and trinkets and pally bubbles. It's just the ranged dps and doomfires we cannot seem to solve. <br>
<br>
Any suggestions?<br>
<br>
As a complete aside, where does everyone tank him? We've been engaging from directly behind him, and tanking him about 15' from the stump back along the path toward where he spawns. This ends up leaving some healers in and amongst the trees over there, but provides a ton of space for the people behind him.</div>

</div>We just got our first archi kill. What I did (as a ranged dps without a pvp trinket) was haul ass out 80 yards away from archi when a fear was coming.<br>
<br>
People need to pan their camera not to look at archi, but the terrain.<br>
<br>
One thing I'm trying to figure out is this:<br>
<br>

<br>
Obviously a well geared and skilled guild that has farmed archi for months. They somehow managed with 7 healers, but what I find more remarkable is how many of their ranged have 90%+ dps uptime. How do you manage that while protecting yourself from fear &gt; doomfire?</div>

<br>
The key is experience in this fight. After some kills, you know how the fire spawns and moves around. Have group ts/vent channels for every tremor group and use the set_cameradistance 4 command if your system is able to manage it.<br>

</div>I haven't found any need for doomfire control. Trying to control it will just mess you up. Don't bring too much melee and focus on individual survival, thats the best way to go. If you try to control doomfires, people will start assuming its not their job to dodge them. "They are supposed to be under control." Wrong, dingdingdingding!<br>
<br>
Limiting peoples positions is actually one of worst things you can do, in my opinion. If someone is supposed to be with his group avoiding doomfires gets a lot harder.<br>
<br>
In short, Archimonde tactics can be compressed into this: Spread people evenly around him and tell them to stay alive. It doesn't get more complicated than that.</div>

</div>I  disagree. Thats a poor way to see the fight - anyone can say 'tell them to stay alive' but you want to provide your raid with the best tools/strategy to make it easy to do so. And spreading out, we found - was the cause of many problems that made this more difficult.  We found 4-point positioning superior mainly because it gives you a clear idea who and what your responsible for and will guarantee possible-death scenarios will not happen (eg being separated from  healer/decurser). <br>
<br>
Remember you can push things like 'individual survival' but its still a team effort to survive - as your survival needs other key people (healers/decursers) ready at a moments notice when things go bad. By just 'spreading out where you want' you have no guarantee who will/wont be in range.  With tight-knit defined group positioning , you have more control.<br>
<br>
However both methods (spreading out vs close-knit groups) can work fine depending on guild and player preference. Its just about finding out what your players are comfortable with.</div>

		<div id="post_message_571080">My closest analogy for Archimonde in TBC is Gruul shatters. <br>
<br>
I'll admit .... /cue "Give me the grace ..." ... our guild absolutely blows at shatters. Hard core suckitude. We basically couldn't deal with them, any way, any how. Every single shatter would result in minimum of 3 deaths. Some of our people are just really really bad at spatial awareness and moving AWAY from people (or things).<br>
<br>
So we went with the assigned positions route, gave everyone a spot on the wall that could prevent them from being thrown, and made them go to "safe spots" before Grasp. <br>
<br>
And it worked. Every time. It slowed down the kill, and we've never done faster than 9 growths (although we haven't done it with 25 mains since ... Hydross-era) ... but it's absolutely 100% controllable. If you die, it's because you're a moron, not because you had bad luck.<br>
<br>
And that, to me, is just like Archimonde. By going with assigned group positions, with absolutely no spread-out, you control that uncontrollable factor. A doomfire in your "zone" (90 degrees, whatever)? Run away. Everyone. Your entire group. You're a self-sufficient little bundle of joy, and you run away from the boss like he has an infectious disease. <br>
<br>
And your group lives. No-one gets stupid and runs the doomfire into another group. No-one stands so close to a doomfire that they get feared into it. You just run away. <br>
<br>
"Spread out and live" only works with exceptional groups of people. You may not realize it, but if you do that kind of strat, you basically are depending on 25 people to not be morons for a period of 7-9 minutes. I hate depending on people that way ... it never ends well.</div>

		<div id="post_message_571115">The 4 point strat with people in the group running straight back when doomfire is headed that way gives u as much "control" as u are gonna get.  I'd add one caveat tho, usually putting one MT healer in each group and having that healer stagger himself slightly from the other 4 players can be of some help (still in tremor totem range tho obviously).  Usually our MT healer only run out with the group if it is apparent they have to to avoid the doomfire.  The rest of the group should all be running out together even if its clear the fire isnt on them (i.e. say the fire is chasing the lock and the other players arent in its path, doesnt matter they should be going back as well).<br>
<br>
IF YOU ARE NOT A MT HEALER OR MELEE YOU SHOULD ALMOST NEVER EVER BE DOOMFIRED.  That is the most important point I think.  When I say never I mean it, ur ranged can easily avoid standing near dfires before fear goes off and saving their ways to break fear ONLY for the times when it has to be broken to avoid running through one.  One easy way to check who is sucking is to use recount and find the dmg from doomfires to each player after an attempt.  Even if u have a called wipe and ppl suicide in them the suiciders only recieve their max health worth of the dmg and won't stand out, the noobs taking 10s of thousands of dmg from doomfires over the course of the fight will and I'd highly suggest swapping those people out for someone who doesnt suck.  When we were first attempting this fight we had an entire raid night (4 hours) of wipes, the players (excluding mt healers and melee) who were good took ~1-2 doomfires over the course of the entire night if that gives u some idea about how often ur raid members should be getting doomfired.</div>

</div>Thats a great idea. I did it a couple times on our first kills, basically pointing the finger over vent and saying 'why the hell are you taking so many doomfires' . It works too.<br>
<br>
You can also use WWS after a night of attempts to analyse player performance. Taking in mind what the above poster said (people die in doomfires during wipes, so allow 1 tick/max health dam for that) you can learn a great deal about who seems to be just not playing-it-safe. On our last Archimonde kill (clean 7.5 minutes) this is who took doomfires:<br>
<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302180616/http://wowwebstats.com/huju2ro444fxy?s=11180-11661&amp;ab=493" target="_blank">Wow Web Stats</a><br>
<br>
So you can see there were 28 doomfires over the course of the fight on 16 players. Only really the top three people there (who took 4, 3, 3 doomfires respectively) I would think to question after and find out if there was any problem they experienced. It was Povskis first night trying Archimonde but the pallys had done it before.  However have the neat Bubble trick which they can use in emergencys - so I let them be a little more reckless sometimes when they want to stand in and heal the MT when required (eg if other mt healers have been airbust/run off from doomfire) if their bubble is not on cooldown, so even if they eat a doomfire they can just shield out of it.<br>
<br>
I would love to see some WWS from other guilds showing how many doomfires your raid takes during the course of a kill.</div>

		<div id="post_message_571271">Heres the report from our MH clear last Wednesday (as a reference we are now at 5/5, 8/9): <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302180616/http://wowwebstats.com/sud4rfjfeqzka?ab=506&amp;s=9836-10353" target="_blank">WWS</a><br>
<br>
We use more like a four "splotches" strategy - we have four groups (2 healers, 3 DD per group) + melee (healed/decursed by a feral druid in heal equip). We generally try to stay close to each other in the groups, move together out of the paths of fires, etc, but we do not try to kite them or control them - if a fire comes in your direction it is your responsibility to evade it while staying close to a decurser (if you get completely cut off, join another group for a short time until the fires have despawned and your group can reform at the proper place again). We had bad experience with trying to kite them (groups stayed away to long kiting the fires, that the MT died several times, because almost all healers were moving/out of range. Using a pure point strategy (ie everyone clusters up and only moves when the guy with the symbol moves) also didn't work to well, as the reaction times were to slow.<br>
<br>
The strategy obviously requires a lot of controlled communication over TeamSpeak - but thats what we have it for. We warn groups when a fire is closing in on them, we warn the melees/MT, we call out if somebody is burning, and so on. It also helped to remind people that the fight is not about DPSing, but about surviving.<br>
<br>
I always have recount open and showing the deaths for the current fight - this way you see immediately who died and can (hopefully) remember their name and quickly look at why they died (ie no heals or too many fires). Though in one try we did get surprised by another heal-shaman on his first kill of Archimonde, when we all suddenly got a Soul-thingie  with everyone alive - he had apparently used his ankh instantly and NS+HW himself up with no one noticing ^^<br>
<br>
What works wonders:<br>

</div>Your mantra should be "STAY ALIVE. STAY ALIVE. STAY ALIVE."  This fight is in no way a DPS race, it's a mini-survival marathon.  We killed him once using the 4 point stratregy, and yes, if you are doing that it is helpful to have the group get airburst together to keep healers/decursers with them.  Biggest problem for us with that strat was too many MT healers getting out of range while running straight out from doomfires.<br>
<br>
We have since switched to tanking Archimonde at the mountain and have had better repeatability.  This eliminates a decent amount of doomfires since they sometimes path up the mountain and are of no consequence to the raid.</div>

		<div id="post_message_571501"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Tyrian, for what its worth, we tried the 4 point strategy, and we had huge issues with MT deaths.  We switched to using an arc formation, with everyone spreading out behind him, and killed him quickly, and our last few kills have all been with a max of 3 attempts - our last attempt was a one shot with 5 or so completely new people in the fight, and one disconnect.<br>
<br>
What was happening with the 4 point strategy for us was that one or two groups would be running from doomfires, one group would get airburst, and then a fear would land and the tank would die since too few healers would be in range.<br>
<br>
Different guilds have different strengths, I understand the main strengths of the 4 point strategy, but at least for us, spreading out works very well, and we emphasize individual responsability on surviving.  Don't insist that it is the best strategy and all others are inferior, as long as you kill the boss reliably with a good margin, then the strategy works.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

With the 4 point and the idea of being safe and moving doomfires away, the tank would get in too much danger, dip low and get killed. We put him up against the mountain now and the groups on the mountain sides can be pretty aggressive. It is more about personal responsibility though, which makes repeat kills sometimes hard to do. Last night we 2 shot him which was pretty fun.  Even before 2.3 with using a bear tank with fear ward, the 4 point strategy would just get our tank killed most of the time.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_571764"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->We tank Archimonde probably 100 yards from the mountain (I'm not good at judging distances). Three ranged groups are spread out on the semi-circle in front of Archimonde. The melee and the warlock group (3 locks, 1 shaman, 1 druid) are behind him. The three ranged groups in front of Archimonde have assigned locations. The idea is to take some of the discipline of the 4-point strategy while lessening healer range issues on the MT. The three ranged groups, especially the middle one, have an easier time helping decurse/heal another group as well.<br>
<br>
We still do the run out strategy on doomfires, but people have become better at knowing when it is safe to sidestep a doomfire and run back. We still have some retardation but we're killing Archimonde faster and lessening the MT gets gibbed issues we had.<br>
<br>
For fear and doomfires, there's a timer on fear. If your trinket is down, position yourself a little bit away from the doomfires. You don't need to be extremely far away to not get feared into one. This is especially true for ranged dps.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>If you have at least 2 priests in raid, you can have 1 healer immune to fear, makes him perfect for healing MT. Trinket and fear ward rotation is invaluable to prevent some nasty spikes during fear or when doomfires chase most healers away. I guess trinket rotation could work, but that just complicates things needlesly.<br>
In our case, we use two such healers, they just stand between groups, strafe doomfires instead of running away and pretty much keep the tank alive no matter what, unless they get bursted. Also, we have druid standing together with melee, who is mostly decursing(feral), but can land some emergency heals on MT when needed.<br>
"Everyone is MT healer" is nice in theory, but sometimes things go out of control, so we found it more effective to always have dedicated healers on tank.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_572750"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->The 4 points strategy with a resto druid being dispelled in the center strategy worked great for us and got him to 14% our first night of attempts.  I think that I will take the suggestion in this thread though to jump the raid over a cliff inside MH over and over again until everyone makes it alive a few times in a row though.  We controlled the doomfires for the most part (a few minor issues to work on with avoiding getting feared into the flames), and MT was staying alive.  2/3 of our wipes were from someone who "lagged" or used their pvp trinket instead of their tears when they got bursted.<br>
<br>
4 points, 5 decursers, 7 healers + 2 hybrids healing (feral druid + prot paladin healed).  I was pretty amazed that the final boss in MH seemed so easy to be honest.  With a good raid setup then it is mostly a 5-8 minute long retard-check for your entire raid.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I've always setup Archimonde the same way. I guess we are lucky to have 3 shaman in every raid though (2 resto, 1 enhance).<br>
<br>
We have 1 melee group with the enhance shaman and 4 melee DPS.<br>
<br>
We use a 4 point strategy. Each group has a group healer, a dispeller (3 mages and Feral druid), and a tank healer. So basically, we run 8 healers and use our Feral druid as a dispeller, freeing up our Resto druid for MT healing.<br>
<br>
Both resto shaman heal their groups, and 2 priests take care of the other 2 groups. This leaves 2 Paladins, 1 Priest and 1 Resto druid MT healing. Since the 4 MT healers are in different groups, the chance of all 4 of them being out of range due to Doomfires is quite small. Group healers help on the MT if no one in their group requires attention.<br>
<br>
The group healers and dispellers also keep an eye on the melee, and heal/dispel as required.<br>
<br>
We've never needed to setup any Fear break rotations on MT healing, since 2 of the MT healers have a Tremor totem in their group, and everyone equips the PvP trinket in case of emergencies. If things get really hairy, our MT just blows Last Stand/Shield Wall to stay alive until healers are back on track.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

We had gone from spreading everyone out to the 4-point strategy to finally getting the kill with a 3-point strategy.

<br>
Quick switch to the spread out around him positioning helped but then we ended up just going with everyone one spread out south of him except the MT positioning.

		<div id="post_message_573386"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Too many MT healers being out of range is the one weakness with the 4 point strategy, and makes it essential for you to have a MT healer in each group.  Even then there can still be problems, which is why I suggested staggering your MT healer slightly from his group and having him run back from doomfire only if he has to.  Occasionally this can create a messy doomfire or two, but where as you can survive someone getting doomfired, or even worst case a soul charge, you cannot survive the MT dying and Archimonde does hit very hard. That said there still needs to be some intelligence applied by your MT healers; stand in range of tremor, dont stand near doomfires when a fear will go off soon, etc...  Paladins and druids make great MT healers here because druids can still heal effectively well moving and paladins can bubble through a fire if too many other MT healers are currently out of range, they still need to play smart position wise though.  One of our attempts not long after we began tracking doomfire damage had an MT healer (druid) taking over 200,000 damage from doomfires during just that one attempt.  Yeah, lol.<br>

</div>From what I understand, you guys have 4 groups all standing on top of each other?<br>
<br>
We simply use 4 groups that each go to a different side of Archimonde. People stay spread out on their side and don't remain clumped up. Make sure you're healing or DPSing from max range also to give yourself more time to react to newly spawned Doomfires.<br>
<br>
I also put icons on all the dispellers, so people with Grip can quickly find a dispeller from another group if their dedicated mage/druid is out of range due to Doomfire or Air Burst. That groups healer can easily keep a Gripped player alive during the time it takes them to identify and run to another group and get dispelled.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Not directly on top of each other (that used to be a good thing to do actually though before when you could get grip+burst) but all close enough to easily be in tremor range and to easily run together from an incoming doomfire.  Originally we tried just assigning a direction like you are saying (i.e. N,S,W,E)  but then you get alot more doomfires that circle around, where as with tighter groups for the most part as long as the whole group other than MT healer run out when a doomfire is chasing one of them you get mostly straight doomfires heading out.  Also, well airburst may be annoying really the only people who it creates any danger for are MT healers or if someone is dumb enough to get your MT airbursted.  <br>
<br>
The icons on decursers is nice but assuming you have 5 decursers it is pretty unnecessary especially since 2.3 where mages can decurse from 40 yards now.  We do not count the druid on MT healing as a decurser, usually we have 3 mages, one druid who is her groups patch healer, and a feral druid in with the melee.  The feral druid will only decurse if the mage behind archimonde is running from a doomfire or airbursted since he obviously wont be able to reach the melee during that time.  With a 40 yard range you can generally get anyone (it might make you have to just take a couple steps) in the groups adjacent to you in case their mage is airbursted.  Doomfire wouldnt matter since the group runs together, the mage can decurse anyone in his group well they are running from it except possibly the MT healer since he will usually not run with the group, he should be easily reachable by the other two adjacent decursers though.  That has worked very well for us, from attempt one decursing was never an issue.  Between decursing and running out with my group from doomfires I don't get very much time to dps at all, and if your ranged are playing correctly they wont either.  It's been said 1000 times already but THE MELEE KILL THE BOSS.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I've always drilled into people's heads that if a Doomfire gets anywhere near them, they need to turn and run. No strafing, no circling around- you go explore the mountains or go camping with your group for a little bit. <br>
<br>
We assign people to sides, and generally they're all within their totem ranges and such, so it's worked for us. The icons on decursers are definitely not necessary, but do tend to come in handy.<br>

</div>I'd like to echo this question, we spent two days on it last week, and while we could stack melee, with few exceptions they were absolutely terrible at avoiding doomfires.  We can probably field about 5 melee who I'd trust to avoid everything reasonable, but that's not stacking, so I'm concerned about where we need to adjust.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_575117"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I don't think you want to spend extra healing on something that is avoidable.We used a melee group of 5 in our first kill and the kill lasted 9 minutes and 56 seconds, that includes the last one minute.In the second kill we decided to use more melee to test it out and the difference was almost more than 2 minutes.<br>
<br>
The thing about 4 point strat it seems for us is, that some of the groups don't do anything at all sometimes but run away, which is acceptable considering they survive and the main tank survives.Melee's job isn't really hard on this fight with berserker rages and cloak of shadows.Your enhancement shamans, your feral druids have to pull out early if it is a problem and you can always run to a "point" as a melee and get healed fully.I've heard on vent after one of the kills that one of our rogues didn't dps for more than a minute just to play it safe.<br>
<br>
So i guess playing it safe, even for the melee is the key.Rogues, especially the undead ones are lovely in this fight, and yes even they wear their pvp medallions.And from my experience the fight goes shorter with 7-8 melee instead of 5 but that can be our people getting used to the fight as well.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_575278">From my experience melee can't really "stick together" if a doomfire happens to loop around Archi's legs or come at them they often just have to CloS/sprint/spread out as fast as possible to avoid getting hit. In some cases they can beeline together towards an opening  - it's just not as easy as it may seem. <br>
<br>
The hardest aspect of this fight for us is still doomfire curling, we are well aware of how the frontal cone targetting seems to work, and are quite effective at "kiting" doomfires, but still have a large number that spawn and start looping before they seem to have latched on to anyone. RNG I suppose, only possibility I have considered is that our positioning relative to the boss may be off (we use 4 corners), such that we're not lining the groups up with the locations where doomfire will generally spawn.</div>

		<div id="post_message_575433">We had our first night of attempts on him last night.  Best we did was low 60's and high 50's with a lot of attempts that were basically over before they even started.  Overall I think we probably had about 20 real attempts over a 4 hour period and in the end I think it was productive as we didn't have people cratering or running straight into doomfires on fears by the end of the night.<br>
<br>
Our consistent issue though was MT healing.  We had 9 healers in the raid and 5 decursers.  We used a 4 point strategy and had 2 healers in each group with a resto in the melee group for tremor totem.  I had instructed the groups to run straight away from Archimonde when a doomfire spawned in their area but because of airburst and the length of time it takes for a doomfire to despawn it seemed that all too often 3 of the 4 groups would be OOR.  This seems to be a re-occuring theme yet I haven't really seen anyone talk about how they specifically addressed this issue other than saying that 3 healers are enough to keep up the MT.  For whatever reason that didn't seem to be the case for us.  Any thoughts on this issue?<br>
<br>
I think if we get that cleaned up we realistically could by our next raid as our best attempts almost always ended with a MT death rather than soul charge issues.</div>

</div>Our solution is basically to abandon a grouping strategy, and just spread out with massive use of vent by the healers and decursers. Our vent during Archimonde is a constant stream of things like "I'm cut off" (meaning a healer is blocked by fire from the MT), "I can't decurse Warlock X" (a decurser is out of range) and "I can't heal Hunter Y" (a healer notices that hunter has a doomfire dot but is out of healing range). Often one of these things will be followed very quickly by "I'm on MT", "I got Warlock X", or "I got Hunter Y" and everyone knows not to worry about it. If nobody calls it out, that poor warlock or hunter pops a pot or healthstone and tries to run closer to someone that can help him. If too many healers call that they're cut off then the MT knows to be really twitchy with shieldwall, last stand, and healthstone.<br>
<br>
As far as the specifics of our healing, we use our fear wards on healers and normally have two tremor totems, one in the melee group and one in a healer group. We have a resto druid stand with the melee so he can decurse anyone in range of the boss and heal the MT. Most of the MT healing comes from the druid and a couple of paladins, although everyone heals him to a degree. Make sure the boss is being debuffed and your tank is buffed (demo shout, thunderclap, ironshield). Try to keep up Earth Shield and Prayer of Mending whenever possible. The fight has been very repeatable for us, after our first kill we usually only wipe if someone screws up a tear click or if the MT misses a stance dance.</div>

</div>We use 2 healers that aren't with any of 4 groups and just stand somewhere "in between". (there's also a feral druid decursing/healing melee, but can't really consider him MT healer, just some small LBs) They do not run away from Doomfires, just sidestep them and are Fear Warded. With 2 Fear Wards, one person is pretty much immune to Fear, if you have 4, that's 2 people. In case you're limited to just 2, one can dispel the other, and then they both heal MT(not to mention they can get Tremors, just in case). Keep in mind, those 2 healers shouldn't stand too close to each other, so they don't get bursted at same time or have to avoid same Doomfire. At absolute worst it means that there's at least one healer on MT during Fear - spamming max rank heals should be enough.<br>
<br>
Obviously, 2 minute Trinket is mandatory, it also helps if at least one of those healers is a Paladin, as he can bubble out of some nastier situations. I prefer being second myself, as I have full control on my own Fear Ward, plus it's always some hots/instants on tank if I have to run. Now, if you do not have a single priest in raid, than it might be somewhat tricky to do it our way  But then again, that would mean you have different issues than just MT healing.<br>
<br>
Also, sidestepping Doomfires instead of "luring" it away from Archimonde isn't really a big issue - sure it might form some pretty circles around those healers, but as long as they are immune to fears, it doesn't matter. Just make sure no one stands too close to them so they won't get Bursted by other people.</div>

</div>Do you have WWS of the kill? After our MT died on a few learning attempts with new people I did a healing breakdown on them and found out they were healing group members/melee more than they healed the MT. After I told them the MT is top priority unless there was something else in-group like doomfire that needed attention, the MT healing improved. <br>
<br>
If you could provide a WWS of your attempts for the night we could see what the healers were healing.</div>

		<div id="post_message_578629">My guild has been wiping on him for the past 2 weeks, for our 1st night we tried spreading method around him in 180 degree, it did not really work well with massive amts of deaths from airburst n doomfire and our best try got him to like 78% before calling the night off.<br>
<br>
That night I skimmed through this entire thread and found the 4 corner strat quite promising for the potential to keep doomfire "ezmode" ie. whole grp just run in n out to avoid fire and get airbursted together. So we end up tryin this 4corner strat for the next 3 nights but we encountered similar issues with MT kept dying when 2grps got cut off by doomfire and another grp got airbursted. <br>
<br>
To fix the MT dying issue, we tried many different positioning tweaks on the 4corner strat:<br>
<br>
1. Putting a healer between each of the 4 groups<br>
2. Putting 3 groups above boss and spreading 3-4healers below him<br>
3. Tried the strafe around and stay in range method using 4corners so we do not have like too many healers out of range<br>
<br>
But ultimately the tweakings were not effective as our MT continued to die and the best try we got him was 15% where I died from fire and chained soul charges to the raid and had another 30% n 40% wipe but basically those are the only attempts that went below 50% out of 100 plus attempts. <br>
<br>
My raid is now in a dilema, is there any other way to do this fight in a 4corner strat and reliably down him every week or do we have to totally change strat to the spreading method and go through another series of wipes to get used to spreading. As of my post, my raid is kinda used to clumping and having a cluster leader to shout out move in n out when doomfire comes and we probably gona take abit of tries to get used to spreading n pple being aware of doomfire.<br>
<br>
We are really out of ideas atm and would really appreciate some help from pple who hav done him every week using 4corners. How do u assign the healers, which healer gets fearwarded, when should the healers top up their own grp and focus on MT, and how do ur healers coordinate when there are unlucky combos like airburst on 1 MT healer n 2 others being chased by doomfire?<br>
<br>
This is the wws for the latest night we spent on him <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302200826/http://wowwebstats.com/n35hkqbcnwjbc" target="_blank">Wow Web Stats</a><br>
There are 4 MT healers assigned to solely just heal him and 4 healers in each corner and 1 druid near the melee.<br>
After looking through the wws, I realised that the raid healers are not healing enough on our tank, any suggestions to allow the raid healers in the 4 corners to stay in to pop heals on tank when there is a doomfire in their sector and the dpsers etc are running out from the fire? Would clumping the dpsers up in each corner and making their healer stay like 15yards away from them viable?<br>

</div>This isn't really related to your question, but I looked through a couple of your attempts, and Demoralizing shout/roar isn't being used. Between that and better maintainence of thunder clap, you could mitigate some of his damage.<br>

		<div id="post_message_578676">The one change we made which helped a lot was to put the MT in a different position relative to the melee, with CoH priests in two groups adjacent, like this:<br>
<br>
G1                     G4<br>
<br>
<br>
        Me.   XX   MT<br>

<br>
G2                    G3<br>
<br>
<br>
CoH priests are in groups 1 and 2.<br>
<br>
Your melee have their backs facing the water, with CoH priests able to help keep them up, and HoT the MT both those melee heal groups had mages in them to decurse melee as soon as they got a grip. We just found that this positioning really helped us ensure that melee didn't die, once other healers had the opportunity to stop "saving the melee" they could focus more on MT healing and we downed him 2 attempts later.</div>

<br>
I think it's difficult to give good advice for Archimonde besides the usual positioning tips. Healing on this fight is annoying to say the least, at least in my personal experience. There's nothing more frustrating than watching the MT dip lower and lower while being chased by a doomfire and finally running back into range only to be airbursted immediately into the Hyjal suburbs again. The fight's a bit stupid like that.<br>
<br>
But when your MT keeps dying and we can assume that the MT is doing the usual to keep himself alive as long as possible it's unfortunately mostly on your healers. Keep in mind that there's a certain randomness to the fight, even when people play very well the RNG can throw some stuff at you which will cause a wipe. Being successful on Archimonde is mostly about reducing the RNG's ability to screw around with you.<br>
<br>
So. First of all, a couple things you really need to make clear to people.<br>
<br>
Archimonde's not a DPS race. It's a survival fight. Everytime a DPS class takes an unnecessary risk which leads to damage that's a heal which is not landing on the MT. In an ideal situation, nobody in the raid should take any damage besides the MT and those who get cursed etc. While this is clearly not a possible scenario the goal's to achieve something close to above.<br>
<br>
When damage is being taken, your raiders need to understand that they're a little bit self reliant. That means that they need to be prepared to use appropriate pots, it means that they need to be aware of their surroundings and be close to a healer and decurser. It means bandaging when standing around 70+ yards from Archimonde with no doomfire in sight.<br>
<br>
Also, and while that might be difficult to do in small raids especially, identify those who constantly eat doomfires or crater or somehow die. Deaths happen, and sometimes even twice in a row, but if you've got some people who absolutely cannot perform adequately on Archimonde then let them sit out. You'll save twentyfour other people a lot of headaches by doing that.<br>
<br>
Your healers should understand that even when there're designated MT and raid healers everybody with a heal button should at least keep an eye on the MT and be ready to help out if needed. Get a macro/vent arrangement where MT healers notify other healers when they can't heal the MT for whatever reason. Get those healers with tremor totem shamans. Get them the low cooldown pvp trinket to get out of fear. Use fearward if you've got a few. Maybe even setup a rotation so there's two healers breaking out of fear at all times (a somewhat soso working thing imho but hey). <br>
<br>
And finally make the healers job easier a bit by not allowing other people to cluster closely to them to avoid airburst unless you use the 1 group 1 airburst strategy of course.<br>
<br>
Just hang in there. If you got him to 15 percent you can get him to 10 percent. Be mindful of the time you attempt Archimonde, don't try him at the end of a raid night when everybody's tired and lacks attention span. Go in fresh on a new raid night if you can. Also, take some breaks in between attempts, he's got no trash to clear after all.<br>
<br>
Good luck.</div>

<br>
Have all your ranged DPS put on stam/pvp gear (this is wise anyway), then engage the boss with explicit instructions that no one but melee is allowed to DPS. Ranged have only one job, staying alive, and DPS is expressly prohibited. We told them to just stay alive, we lasted until just before the enrage timer ran out that attempt, and it was a few attempts later where we downed him. In one attempt we really managed to train people to focus on clicking tears at the right time, being proactive in avoiding doomfires, and also at communicating. Once communication and individual responsibility have been worked out, you're very close to a kill - just wait it out.</div>

		<div id="post_message_579150">Firstly, i am from the same guild as grapes.<br>
<br>
I want to elaborate more on what grapes said and what is the difference with our strat from the strat in EJ with the 4 corners method  I will it list out as follows<br>
<br>
1) Referencing from post #739 under archimonde thread, Tyrian of Blackrock, the difference between our 4 corners and the picture is that we position ourself slightly near the mountain which is located top right of the picture near the tree trunk location. Moreover, the area is quite small and not many areas to run. Lets say for instance the doomfire chased a person towards the hill, does anyone noticed that the doomfire will change it direction if the person is standing on top of the hill ? However we do encounter several times when a person is behind the tree and the doomfire is aiming at him, it sort of change target and treat as if the current target isn't in line of sight. Is there any relevant post that i might have miss out regarding the doomfire and those people who are standing on the hill ?<br>
<br>
2) Does having a druid in melee group rather then he standing 20 yards away from Main Tank really helps to lighten the burden on the healers ? Reason why he isn't standing in the melee group is because he usually gets feared into doomfire and it turns up healing the druid rather then healing main tank.<br>
<br>
3) During our first few tries, we split the 8 healers into the 4 cluster groups  and 1 into the melee group and they will move out if they are being chased by doomfire. The problem with this strategy is that if one being chased by doomfire and another being airbursted which doesn't solve the MT from dying. How do most of you guys resolve this problem?<br>
<br>
In the end we tried to split the healers into 1 per cluster and 4 healers standing in the middle of each groups but the doomfire caused more havoc n thus cutting off healers n the MT death issue was not resolved</div>

		<div id="post_message_579236">I'd say Archimonde is a fight where each guild will have its own strategy, based on the lineup, the strengths and weaknesses of the members, the number of healers... There is no perfect strategy that works for everyone, due to the silly randomness. But there are advice that can be given.<br>
<br>
What I did after some wipes was to make 2 groups, one small group with 3 pallys, 1 shaman and 1 mage, which is facing Archimonde (thus closer from the MT), and is completely alone. The 3 pallys of course heal the MT, and of course try to spread out as far as they stay in range of the totems. The chaman only heals this group so that the workload remains quite low, even if all of them are under doomfire. The tremor totem minimalizes the fear uptime, and if not proccing soon enough, they can rotate bubble/dispel. The mage only decurses this group. The other group is spread on a 180 angle behind Archimonde, with 4 other decursers (usually 3 more mages and 1 resto druid), each decurser being assigned to a specific angle, and marked by a raid icon.<br>
<br>
This has some advantages, and drawbacks. The 3 paladins care only about the MT and are not tempted to heal anyone else, or even themselves (except an instant heal coming back from air burst). The lack of healing on the MT is immediately notified in case of an air burst, which is a clear signal for the other healers to help out. They just say "air burst on pal #" and the help arrives. As 3 paladins may be not enough to heal the MT, the resto druid keeps his hots on him, bursting when needed, and healing the raid/decursing when it's quieter. The drawback is that, if they are somehow too close from each other, they may all be air bursted at the same time. It's a matter of practice. The second drawback is that the shaman may have troubles to heal himself if all the group is doomfired. It's quite rare though.<br>
<br>
Besides this, having a lot of shamans is a huge help, we did our first kill with 5 (1 enhance, 4 resto), we usually kill him with 4, and always have at least 3. Pvp trinkets and smart group optimization are also a big help. For instance, the fury warrior won't need a tremor totem, so he should be placed in a group with no shaman, preferably in the MT group, even if there's a dps loss. Frost mages (it does help if your mages have troubles with the fight) also are less dependant to the tremor totem, and warlocks can drain life to stay alive while waiting for some heal. BM hunters can also be immune to fear, if they manage to keep their pet alive.<br>
<br>
Fear wards are useful on healers, especially priests who can dispel other fears (and they really should do so, especially the shadow priests). Fire cauldron can also help when trying the boss. Anyone being in danger should use HS + healing pot, you should be careful to this (you can see it with a death log like Recount or Assessment), most people die because they forget/don't want to use potions. Make everyone use the tear of the goddess before the pull, as some people argue that they cratered because the spell animation froze their game (believe it or not, but this can be prevented). And as said before, if you notice anyone repeatedly lagging out, dying stupidly or making big mistakes (like air bursting the MT), you really should sit him out for the good of the raid.<br>
<br>
PS : even if it's not a dps fight, the shorter it is, the less randomness you undergo. People should absolutely not take risks, but they must go all out as soon as they can. Mages and rogues are very useful here, as rogues aren't too disturbed by the doomfire, and mages (while also decursing) have a great mobility, can cross doomfires to reposition into a safer spot, and can blink immediately when air bursted, even being able to choose where to land.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I should mention that we did a training attempt that our MT actually came up with the idea for, which was absolutely amazing for getting people into the right mindset.<br>
<br>
Have all your ranged DPS put on stam/pvp gear (this is wise anyway), then engage the boss with explicit instructions that no one but melee is allowed to DPS. Ranged have only one job, staying alive, and DPS is expressly prohibited. We told them to just stay alive, we lasted until just before the enrage timer ran out that attempt, and it was a few attempts later where we downed him. In one attempt we really managed to train people to focus on clicking tears at the right time, being proactive in avoiding doomfires, and also at communicating. Once communication and individual responsibility have been worked out, you're very close to a kill - just wait it out.</div>

- By learning you'll improve your survival on this encounter and countering soul charges works towards that as well.<br>
The two elements on their own work towards each other until you reach the point where you kill Archimonde.<br>

<br>
My guild also initially had problems with the 4 group postitioning, but after trying the all the different basic strategies decided it was best for us.<br>
<br>
We put a dedicated paladin to stand on the melee and try to focus on the MT. Considering the chances of having 3 groups incapable of healing (1 air burst, 1 doomfire, 1 running back from either one), having that 5th spot that only has to worry about a small chance of air burst (well, with rogues vanishing that is) or a looping doomfire helps immensely. I've definitely kept the tank up by myself quite a few times while the rest of the raid was busy, and without a doubt it has helped quite a lot for MT or melee healing. I can also keep tabs on the melee dps, which helps you avoid a doomfire + burst out of range melee death. Even if I eat a burst, it means that there should be 2 raged groups capable of continuing. <br>
<br>
The main issues I find with being in the melee group is that I often spend quite a bit of time not doing anything after a burst, simply because of having a doomfire spawn in front of me as I run back. That, and there's been a wipe or two that the tank has died probably because I was more focused on getting back then healing first, figuring that it was better to get into position first. The dead zone of where the doomfires has to be crossed pretty carefully; there's no stopping after you get within 25yards of arch or so. I don't believe these problems outweigh the positive, though, as it still provides another group for a healer to stand in that doesn't take away from the 4 corners.<br>
 <br>
Between the pvp trinket and bubble, along with a tremor totem (our MT group is normally MT,rogue,war, shaman, me) the only real time I'll eat a doomfire is either from a stupid mistake on my part or a looping doomfire after wasting a bubble. Even if I do get an unlucky doomfire, a druid can toss hots on me and I'm at least getting a decent amount of mana back from spiritual attunement.<br>
<br>
<br>
Each healer has to go into the fight with the thought that they are the only one healing the tank at any time, assuming they don't need to heal through any other raid damage. That said, every memeber of the raid needs to realize that any damage they take is taking away a healer's attention on the MT. Once the raid got used to not getting hit by doomfire as much, we had a lot more constant attention on the MT, and it became quite rare to have a MT death be the reason for a wipe.<br>
<br>
I'm not 100% sure, but I also believe the 2 healers in each of our groups try to spread out a bit, to lower the chance of having a burst or doomfire make them both run away. With the increased decurse range, you gain quite a bit of leeway to have groups spread out a bit. There's been a few situations where we've had one healer in the group that was out of the cone of a doomfire, or out of the range of a burst and was capable of staying on the MT.<br>
<br>
Anyhow, in terms of group and healer composition, 2 healers on each corner (one corner with one good healer if you run with 8), fear wards on priests or druids (curse + fear is a pretty nasty combo, it's enough to kill someone if nobody is capable of healing or decursing them in time), and try to just keep hots and spot heal on the people who get doomfired to keep them up. As long as you can get a good amount of hots on someone there's really no pressing need to keep them topped off, as long as they're above 80% or so they should be fine. MT always takes priority when there's no realistic danger to anyone, and just in general the fight isn't very demanding on mana as long as you have a SP. Also, with mobs that do slow, large attacks, there's no reason not to overheal if you feel the swingtimer coming back up.<br>
<br>
People also need to realize that their PvP trinket is there for running-into-doomfire emergenices only (minus healing emergencies, of course), not to up their position on the meters. Actually in general the meters really don't matter, so much of this fight is so relative that the damage meters are more or less meaningless.<br>
<br>
Being calm and attentive is the most important part of the fight; to make sure that there's no doomfires in the immediate area before a fear, to make sure that the raid stays healed along with MT attention, and that people can at least try to realize when other groups are just getting destroyed and they have to pick up for their healers on the tank. The fight's self-reliance is quite similar to c'thun; jobs regulated to 4 groups of 5, but every memeber of those groups must pay attention all the time, and should even be capable of overextending themselves to other groups as needed.</div>

</div>I think you missed a key part here. The druid who stands with the melee must get some sort of fear protection or a strategy to deal with fear - and he doesnt necessarily need to be in the melee group to achieve that.  If they arent in the melee group, someone IN the melee group can dispel them when fear comes. We use a ret pally  to do this, but you could put a holy pally in the group for same effect. Refer to posts on the previous pages for more detailed explanation of this.  The sequences of events is this:<br>
<br>
Fear wards on melee shaman -&gt; fear -&gt; ret/holy pally gets tremor totem dispel -&gt; ret/holy pally dispells druid. This all happens within 1-2 seconds, before your druid is in any danger. It might sound complicated but its all very easy and happens fast, providing your shaman/paladin know what they're doing.</div>

		<div id="post_message_579411">3rd kill for us last night, was the 5th attempt of the night I believe.<br>
<br>
My mantra on this fight is "personal accountability". The people who typically die on this fight in my guild are ranged DPS and healers who aren't paying attention. Having the majority of our locks/mages being undead with a pvp trinket there's really no excuse to ever get feared into a doomfire. We made it very clear that getting hit by a doomfire if you have trinket or wotf up means you are not doing your job. Getting hit by a doomfire when not feared is grounds for an immediate raid kick. Excuses are not acceptable, everyone needs to be doing everything they can to avoid doomfire. On top of that, if you messed up and got hit, you MUST use a consumable to stay alive. If combat logs revealed that someone got hit by a doomfire then did not even use a healthstone/potion (doing everything they can to stay alive), they were immediately docked dkp.<br>
<br>
Personal accountability is the only way to do this fight. Our second kill was done with 23 due to a lack of replacements for people we had to kick from the raid. However, once people got the message that dying for any reason was completely unacceptable, they played much more cautiously, resulting in clean, easy kills.<br>
<br>
I also stole another quote from previously in this thread: "Melee dps's the boss. Melee dps's the boss. Melee dps's the boss. Range, stay alive." Once again, it's all about making sure everyone has their priorities straight.<br>
<br>
Does this post seem repetitive? There is a reason for this, it's the best way to teach your players. Constantly remind them about their priority - stay alive. Don't get hit by doomfire. If you get hit, it's because you weren't playing perfectly. Play better next time. Surviving this fight it 100% based on your personal skill level. Don't accept excuses. Don't get hit by doomfire. Melee dps's the boss. You are personally responsible for your own survival.</div>

</div>The only way you could be killed instantly after ressing is if you got immediately air bursted (by someone standing near you), you ressed in a doomfire (stupidity), or you get hit by a soul charge (stupidity). While getting air bursted by someone else isn't stupidity, it is preventable with the application of some brain cells. Hence if done wisely, there is zero chance of causing "cascading deaths" simply by taking a res.<br>
<br>
Assuming you are not killed instantly upon ressing, you can pop a consumable, or if you're a shaman, NS heal yourself. This will take you out of the danger zone of "insta-death". A bandage or another healer afterwards will bring you up to a high HP level. There is zero risk of dying if battle resses/ankhs/soulstones are done properly.<br>
<br>
I believe like many others in this thread that all deaths on this fight are 100% preventable through skill. The real question is, if you died in the first place, it means you messed up: Would you mess up again?</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Firstly, i am from the same guild as grapes.<br>
<br>
I want to elaborate more on what grapes said and what is the difference with our strat from the strat in EJ with the 4 corners method  I will it list out as follows<br>
<br>
1) Referencing from post #739 under archimonde thread, Tyrian of Blackrock, the difference between our 4 corners and the picture is that we position ourself slightly near the mountain which is located top right of the picture near the tree trunk location. Moreover, the area is quite small and not many areas to run. Lets say for instance the doomfire chased a person towards the hill, does anyone noticed that the doomfire will change it direction if the person is standing on top of the hill ? However we do encounter several times when a person is behind the tree and the doomfire is aiming at him, it sort of change target and treat as if the current target isn't in line of sight. Is there any relevant post that i might have miss out regarding the doomfire and those people who are standing on the hill ?<br>
<br>
2) Does having a druid in melee group rather then he standing 20 yards away from Main Tank really helps to lighten the burden on the healers ? Reason why he isn't standing in the melee group is because he usually gets feared into doomfire and it turns up healing the druid rather then healing main tank.<br>
<br>
3) During our first few tries, we split the 8 healers into the 4 cluster groups  and 1 into the melee group and they will move out if they are being chased by doomfire. The problem with this strategy is that if one being chased by doomfire and another being airbursted which doesn't solve the MT from dying. How do most of you guys resolve this problem?<br>
<br>
In the end we tried to split the healers into 1 per cluster and 4 healers standing in the middle of each groups but the doomfire caused more havoc n thus cutting off healers n the MT death issue was not resolved</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div><br>
Most of your questions have been answered a couple of suggestions I would make that I haven't seen so far:<br>
<br>
Make sure your MT healers communicate with the raid, we have been using 4pt for months and don't have problems with MT deaths because the healers yell out when multiple are airburst/ or out of range 'cause of doomfires. This gives 'raid' healers plenty of time to get a heal in or gives the tank himself warning to HS/LS/SW/Trinket, hell a shadow priest might be in range to shield. <br>
<br>
That being said your WWS shows 10 healers so there should really be no problem assigning 5 healers full time on the tank and as long as they are near a decurser they can be independent of groups and minimize the risk of multiple getting hit by the same burst.<br>
<br>
Melee, melee, melee. But support your Melee. Have 2 priests communicate with your melee groups Shaman so that he is constantly fear warded or has his PvP trinket available. A Shaman breaking/being immune to fear and manually using grounding is much better than waiting for up to 4.99*s on a pulse (Also means he can have SoE down the whole fight). It will remove the chance of melee getting feared in to doomfire and it will give them 30+ extra seconds of DPS over the fight.</div>

Fear wards on melee shaman -&gt; fear -&gt; ret/holy pally gets tremor totem dispel -&gt; ret/holy pally dispells druid. This all happens within 1-2 seconds, before your druid is in any danger. It might sound complicated but its all very easy and happens fast, providing your shaman/paladin know what they're doing.</div>

I think this would be the critical issue for my guild here, we initially had a restore druid in the melee group for decurse and MT healing duty but he kept dying from doomfire. (We did not fw him or fw the enhance shammy who died alot also in his group)<br>
<br>
So we end up trying to put healers in between the 4 points but they mostly got chased by doomfire/unlucky airburst combos and as a result too many healers got cut off and MT died very often.<br>
<br>
I think we might revert back to the original 4point strat posted way back in this thread on page 30 with 2healers per group and maybe 1-2more in melee group WITH fear protection full time. With this setup, even with 2groups being chased by doomfire and 1 getting airbursted, there is still another group with and the melee group within range totalling up to 3-4 healers being able to get on the MT immediately.<br>
<br>
Coupled with the MT healers using vent more actively to communicate as mentioned by Joy and having the entire raid take minimal damage from proper doomfire control, I think the chances of success will be increased. Thx for the various advices given. Cheers.</div>

If I look at my Archimonde kill yesterday, I end up first on damage as well as on dispel. Much like every week.

Anyway, this is a quite fun event, it just requires a lot of attention, but I'd say it's still less difficult than Illidari Council. Just remember that the more you dps, the less you will face stupid deaths.</div>

If all else fails, if a Doomfire or a Grip is ticking on you and there is no way you are going to be able to save yourself (pot/HS or other 'oh-shit' abilities are on cooldown or out of range of healers/decursers or whatever) hit this. <br>

</div>Warriors have defensive stance and high HP pools to start with to survive doomfire. It doesn't hit melee unless it loops completely around anyways, and you'll be in range of nearly every healer.<br>
<br>
Intercept assures near 100% dps uptime on the boss (it does bug/resist sometimes though, meaning you have to run back).<br>
<br>
Our kills have always been 2 rogues at the top, followed by me (arms for the first kill, tanked the 2nd kill, prot dps for 3rd kill).<br>
<br>
Still, I wouldn't suggest more than 4-5 melee dps, simply because you'd get more air bursts on them, even when spread into 2 groups.<br>
<br>
Highest dps? Your most skilled player, but if you use a strat like ours where the range's first priority is to avoid doomfire and decurse, some type of melee.</div>

I dont love melee persay - we only have 1 melee group. But there is a massive disparity in the damage the 5 melee put out compared to anyone else.

		<div id="post_message_581401">He would have to be using a 'spread out all around Arch, dodge doomfires' strat to be that high on dps. Either that or his melee are terrible. The results sound impressive, but they come with a cost you didnt mention - its risky for range to try do that much dps - especially for players  new to the fight or who haven't been farming Archimonde. Guilds that are learning the fight probably shouldnt try to copy you. <br>
<br>
I dont think theres any <i>need</i> for range to dps much. Our melee (3 rogues, shaman, ret pally, fury warrior) account for ~60% of total damage to archimonde on a typical fight, theres just no need for anyone else to take any risks to push some extra dps - he'll still die well before the enrage. But again, if your guild is advanced and players know the fight in and out - people can afford to try new things like that<br>
<br>
To repeat a comment earlier: Our mages (and other ranged dps arent much higher) usually do ~300-600 dps on archimonde and sometimes will do less damage than the protection  warrior mt'ing him. Perfect! As long as they stay alive and decurse the whole time - they did their job. Archimonde will still die in 7-8 minutes regardless.<br>
<br>
Melee dps the boss -&gt; Range dance around Archimonde -&gt; 6-10 minutes later, he falls over and dies.</div>

</div>Or maybe you should consider changing your melees ? ^^<br>
95% of the players here confirm the fact that melees kill Archimonde, you are probably the exception that confirms the rule.<br>
<br>
We often bring 1 group of melees for Archimonde, 2 rogues, 2 warrs and 1 enhancement shammy, all in the same group. They do around 60% of the damage if not more, all over 1k dps, sometimes reaching 1.3k+. Tremor totem pretty much annihilates the fear for rogues, CloS allow rogues to get rid of doomfire, and warriors take it very rarely. Only the shaman may require a bit more healing (especially if he lands grounding instead of tremor as our did last night ).<br>
<br>
As for the fact they'll get air bursted more, air burst being random and having a casting time allowing players to spread a bit before it lands, I don't see why it would be the case. And even if air burst, sprint or intercept back.<br>
<br>
As for mages being top dps, that means you use a very risky strat, unless you take 5+ mages. Dispells should be done by mages primary, as druids are quite busy healing and hotting what they can - and there is no way a mage can be top dps using so many GCD on decursing unless other dps classes don't do their job properly (I don't think a mage can beat a good affliction warlock as well for example)</div>

</div>Agree with your sentiment. Either that guilds melee are terrible, or the so called top-dps mages are taking alot of risks. Or maybe that player finds a sweet secluded spot where he can dps for 10 minutes straight and never got Airbusted or have to move from a doomfire. Thats like Void reaver - its  not very useful information - of course players who dont have to move much (when everyone does it constatly) perform relatively well on dps.  Ironically though, I find it much more enjoyable playing archimonde on my mage as someone who just runs around decursing and watching doomfires - its the first real fight where dps doesnt matter, why not enjoy it? <br>
<br>
But alot of new guilds come to this thread asking 'Whats the best way to learn/attempt archimonde?' or "How to we make our strat as safe/retard-proof as possible' and they need to take comments like that with a grain of salt.</div>

		<div id="post_message_581516">It ist our 3rd week now, and the best try was 17% in the first week, we didnt get pass 50% in the second and now 11% last week. Its a really anoying fight, we didnt use a 4-point strategy, more a random spread-out of people, with 4 mt<br>
healers(mostly 2 paladin/2 priests) behind the mt and 5 raidhealers, while everyone will spread in a semi-circle behind him. We had in the first trys only 3 decursers(1 Druid/2 Mages) but now we have 3 Mages/1 Druid all the time. We got about 3-4 shamans(1 enhancer/1 elemental/2 restoration). The rest of the raid setup is mostly 3-4 warlocks/1-2 hunters/4 melees.<br>
<br>
We have only the mt healers fearwarded(works fine, we have mostly 2 holy priests/3 shadows) and with the pvp insignia we dont really have problems with the fear. I`m the mt and stance dance ist not a problem. Our main problem is the doomfire and the fact that mt healers have to run at a point to avoid df. Thats why in these &lt;20% trys  the mt mostly dies. Our tank position is about 40 yards from the mountain(buff spot). Im thinking to try out the 4-point strategy, but i dont know how much will that take until we are at this point what we reached now. In the description the 4-p strategy is very nice to read but im not so sure if that will work so fine for us.<br>
<br>
Another problem is, the trys we make are very unrealiable: 1 try= 40%, then 5-6 trys with 90/80/90 and so on. I really don't want to get the kill in a "lucky try" and every weak afterwards to hope again. So do you have any ideas that would help us, or should we just try the 4-p strategy?</div>

		<div id="post_message_581524">3p strategy, 4p strategy or cone strategy.. It all comes down to the same things: Quick and stable healing, fast decurse, no stupid airburst deaths and correct handling of fires and fears.<br>
<br>
Quick and stable healing?<br>
- Make sure that enough healers at any time can reach the tank which usually means make sure noone is stupid enough to drag a doomfire all around the place effectivly blocking healers. Also hots (gogo restodruids here) are awesome.<br>
<br>
Fast decurse?<br>
- Good positioning by mages is key to that, if more than 1 group can decurse their own group AND reach the melee/tanks it's very good.<br>
<br>
Airbursts?<br>
- Use tear sooner than later..<br>
<br>
Doomfires?<br>
- Lead them away from raid and be adaptive in where you stand, you can shift the position of a group based on doomfire so as it can still dps boss and heal mt.<br>
<br>
Fears?<br>
- Trinket/WOTF/Totem/Fearward. With all those things you shouldn't really have much problems with fears. The easiest way is of course to have a shaman in each group that is lightning quick and have ace timing on putting down the totem so it pulses with the fear-cast, fearward can save the tank. Always make sure to top of tank before fear aswell.</div>

		<div id="post_message_581537">We never tried the 4p strategy, I think (as I did in my first post on this thread) that every raid will eventually come up with a strategy that works, regarding the lineup, the individuals strengths and weaknesses and the personnality of the raid leader.<br>
<br>
Basically, we raid Archimonde with 4 mages when we can, 3 if we can't. 1 resto druid, rarely 2 (mainly because we only have one very active, having 2 druids would definately help on him), all the decursers are wisely spread and marked with a raid icon, so that we never lose time running after people, especially (and I want to stress on this point) with the new 40 yards decurse range, which helps a lot. Groups try to stay together, around the totem (when there's a totem), and don't hesitate to move if the position has too much fire on it.<br>
<br>
What about melees then ? Well, they do not indeed try to spread and avoid the air burst, because doing so might endanger the MT if someone fucks up (and it happens, if noone ever fucks up Archimonde would be easier than Rage ), or on the other hand might run into a fire behind, which is also not suitable. So yes their dps is limited by their uptime, whereas mages basically only lose some GCDs decursing and blinking through fires. On the last kill, I ended up first on dispels with a total of 10, I believe the fight lasted around 6 minutes, the second was the druid with 9, and a mage with 8. It's not THAT much, 10 GCDs are worth 15 seconds of casting, and the time lost by people running back after an air burst is much more than that (even for a fury warrior I think).<br>
<br>
Affli locks should do great also, it's just that when we don't have 5 chamans, they are in the MT groups, first for imping him, second because they are much less vulnerable to fire than other classes, being healed more efficientely and being able to drain life while waiting for some healing.<br>
<br>
To the one who said your mages do 300-600 dps, well that seems very low to me, it's important to survive, but my credo is that the more you dps, the less it lasts, and my experience as a raid leader is that something will _always_ happen, sooner or later. If you dps a lot, that eliminates the later. Last time I killed it, Assessment told me around 1000 dps, which is still quite low for a mage, but there's not much reasons to do less, of course except if you're being really unlucky with fires.<br>
<br>
When a friend trying this boss asks me for advice, there are just few basic things I can tell : focus on survival, adapt the strategy and positions to your very particular raid, and try to shorten the fight as much as possible, as long as you're not jeopardizing your survival.</div>

		<div id="post_message_581571">Besides Vonwen, there is a high difference between dps and damage done, as some mods calculate the dps according to your activity. So you can have 1k dps, if you spend half of the fight running around decursing and avoiding doomfire, you'll have less damage done than the warrior with 800 dps who has 90% dps uptime. All our mages are around 1k dps on Archimonde, but with perhaps half the damage done by melees, who have 90+% dps uptime. (I'm sorry, but melee have higher dps uptime on this boss than ranged if both play well - mages have to stand still to dps, and they'll HAVE to move to avoid doomfire or to go decursing the guy who got air burst or whatever, whereas the melees can just keep dpsing moving around Archimonde to avoid doomfires).<br>
<br>
Of course, if you don't give totems to your melees, nothing I can do about that =)</div>

		<div id="post_message_581647">Whew, so basically 3 days on this guy so far...and it keeps getting more frustrating.   We've been working with a 4 point strat.  The first hour or so of each night is people remembering what they are doing.  Few deaths to craters, few deaths to doomfire, few deaths to curses.  Then we get that out of the way.  Then for the next few hours we die to a couple of different things.  The worst thing we are dealing with is MT death.  At some point during the fight, 2 groups are out with fire, one group got airbursted and the last group just cant hold the MT up.  Usually the first time this happens he uses his tricks to stay alive,t hen it happens again at some point and he dies.  <br>
<br>
<br>
It seems like if we got luckky he might die, but itd be purely up to chance.  Using a 3 point strat only seems to aggravate this too many people being out of the fight issue.  So, my only other option is to try a cone strat, and I havnt been able to find too much information on it.  I've looked around for vids, and most i find for cone strat seem to be before the doomfire change.  Are peopel still using cone strat still?  Below I'll list my few fears and some questions I have about it.<br>
<br>
Do people dodge doomfire or run out?  It seems that straight up dodging doomfire is easy for some and hard for others, if its coming near you do you just run away like 4 points?  Or try to swerve sideways a bit and dodge it?  My other possible solution is that everyone in that area runs back until you figure out who its targetting, and then that person keeps running back.<br>
<br>
In the case of that person running back, how do you handle decurse for him?  Does it become an issue to the point that a mage runs back with him?  Or is it really not so bad? <br>
<br>
Is it safer to have the MT's back to the group, or have him on the opposite side?  Bosskillers screams that you must have the MT face the boss away from the raid....but I cant find a logical reason for that, and it seems if the melee is opposite the rest of the raid, that theyd get doomfire trailed to them less often.  <br>
<br>
Positioning.  If we have him near the mountain, does the mountain kill doomfires?  If we place him near the lake(not close enough for him to get angry and nuke the raid obviously), do people use it to get doomfire off them?  Is that a useful strat at all for people to run and take a swim?  Are they easily healable there?  <br>
<br>
I think thats everything, long boring day at work today with not much to do, so I'll be trying to think of any other questions I have.</div>

MT is in full t5 sans hat, which he replaced with the chicken hat out of ZA.  He's using ZA boots, Kaz' sheild, and autoblocker and moroe's for trinkets, he logged out after switching to pvp, so his armory wouldnt be too helpful.<br>

</div>Oh, I don't argue on the fact that mages are one of the best classes to take for Archimonde (on paar with druids, and ofc around 10 000 miles behind shamans, we did it once with 2 shammies - never again), I just highly doubt that mages can be top damage done on Archimonde on a regular basis  (ie. in more than a few guilds and more than once)<br>
<br>
About the MT dying problem, are you sure druids and priests do whatever they can to keep hots ticking on the main tank, especially before a fear ?<br>
<br>
I usually tell paladins to focus on the main tank, shamans to heal the melees and their groups, and druids and priests to heal their groups + hotting the MT. In this fight, because players have to move a lot, they also must be very flexible in their tasks : every healer is at some point a tank healer or a group healer, and each healer should always keep an eye on the MT (the use of /focus is very useful).<br>
<br>
We use a 4 points strategy for the initial minute, after that doomfires usually break our setup and each group lives his own "life" around his decurser, with some interactions with groups in range of heals &amp; decursers.<br>
<br>
Tell your MT to not to be shy on cooldowns, he has a lot and some are usable more than once. Shit will happen, especially during your first kills, and he'll have to live a few seconds on his own (be it someone dying, a whole group feared in doomfire, etc). Communication between the healers and the MT is very important so the tank can be prepared  .</div>

What is wrong with your dps warrior? Why is a dps warrior eating 16 doomfires over the night when there are 11 attempts and hes in a shaman group and also able to break his own fear? Yes I know people kill themself on doomfires in a wipe, but you dont get to chance do that every wipe - and when you have more doomfires on you than attempts in total - something strange is going on. <br>

<br>
One mage has done double the decursing of the others. Did your mages work out a 'you decurse and ill concentrate on dps' rotation because the highest decursing mage does almost 0 damage for the night. Just curious why they chose to do this? Did you assign that mage to look after melee - because if your spread evenly around the boss (you said your using 4 pt strat) the decursing should be fairly even as well - certainly not one player having double the others. If your having decurse deaths - is it because the other mages are assuming this mage will do all the work for them? (and maybe hes airbusted at the time and couldnt etc)</div>

		<div id="post_message_581734">That night melee was getting doomfired a lot probably once an attempt or so, at least.  People were really bad at letting melee know it was creeping up on them.  I was in melee healing us all with tremor.   I made it a point to focus on the next night and it was better.  Of all the melee, our warrior does suck the most at avoiding doomfires.  <br>
<br>
Ultimaas is a decursing god.  And often our highest dps mage, all mages are supposed to assist on melee and they say ultimaas is just faster and always beat them to it.  He is incredibly fast, but I have talked to them about the issue, he isnt assigned to not dps, but he appears to be better at listening, i.e. decursing is always more important then dpsing.</div>

</div>There are a lot of things you could do to improve your tank's mitigation. <br>
<br>
- Avoidance wins on Archimonde, assuming you can keep 20k hp or more. If you look at the report I linked above, it shows me having avoided 72.7% of Archimonde's attacks, while Athen avoided 56% in that last pull. He took less damage per hit but I'm assuming that's because of lack of curse of recklessness on Archimonde. I'd get rid of the autobuckler for another avoidance trinket too.<br>
<br>
- Shaman in the tank group, we usually have the tank/elemental shaman/3 healers in one group until we outgeared the fight. Grace of Air is a good bit of dodge, tremor to break fears on healers, and a resto druid here allows more healing on the tank.<br>
<br>
- Ancestral Fortitude uptime. There's enough downtime for healer shamans that they can proc it on the tank using rank 1 LHW, 25% armor is huge.<br>
<br>
- Cooldowns. Assuming scarab/moroe's, you'll be able to pop one cooldown every fear for 7 fears in a row. Usually you'll dodge/parry enough hits that you don't need cooldowns, but having scarab (3min cd) moroes (2min cd) last stand (8min cd) shield wall (30min cd) means you should have enough cooldowns to survive bad fears and bad airbursts.</div>

		<div id="post_message_581771">Hmm...I'm really not sure how to get 4 healers and the tank in range of tremor totem.  Especially moving in and out, unless they all hid in melee.  How do you work that ?<br>
<br>
Our healer shaman(xmas month has us down to one atm) rarely has any downtime.  And if hes running out to avoid doomfire, ancestral is going to completely fall off.  Although I imagine with him and 2 priests, its up fairly often just from normal spells.<br>
<br>
I tried to make it clear that are issue wasnt him surviving through fears, but rather surviving through 2 groups out for doomfire and 1 group airbursted, leaving only 1-2 healers on him for  a good chunck of time.  Often if this synched witih fear, he'd blow CD's but it was already GG because of his lack of previous heals.  <br>
<br>
I dont mean to sound unnapreciative with that last bit, just wasn't really the issue we were having.  Just seemed that there was a high chance for many healers to be out of range a fair portion of the time.<br>
<br>
Edit:  Perhaps however you work that shaman +3 healer group is the solution.</div>

I can't imagine having only 1-2 out of 8 healers in range of the tank for any extended period of time, though. Perhaps it's more of a problem of positioning the healers more. We use 4 points to start the fight. The 8 healers are spread 2 healer in each spot (we used to have 3 healers in the mt group, 2 healers in other 2 groups, and 1 healer in the last group without tremor). Usually one, maybe two, sides get rocked by fires and whatnot. But that still leaves 4 healers free to heal the tank at any given moment.<br>
<br>
I recall a few of our wipes happening because the three healers in the tank group stood next to each other and got air bursted together. I'd emphasize spreading out especially for healers, it's bad to have more than one healer get hit by airbursted if it can be easily prevented by moving a few yards away from the air bursted target before hand.<br>
<br>
Our tank deaths were during fears until we fixed them with proper use of tremors, I assumed you had the same problems.<br>
<br>
Edit: The tank group was elemental shaman/tank/3 healers, not resto shaman. Was a typo.</div>

		<div id="post_message_581841">Hm, we run with a 3 point strat, 1 healer in the middle and a couple healers with each side group.  That way there's always the middle healer with the tank (unless airburst) and then ~2 minimum from 1 of the side groups.  All 3 groups are never running away since the doomfires are "confined" to the 3 points we give them, there isn't much room for them to spread out.  The middle healer is a druid so swiftmend and NS are available for spike healing fast and we've rarely needed more.  Then again, we usually run really healer heavy due to who is online and can keep themselves alive well.  (9-10 healers for our kills.)</div>

		<div id="post_message_581842">Hmm...<br>
We were having issues the first day with the airburst.  One player in the group would get airbursted, then might get a curse, and die on the way back.  (could be fixed by the mage running back for sure, but some nubbery was happening).  Or the decurser got airbursted, and while running back someone in teh group got it and took massive dmg.  Or sometimes the group was spread out and got seperated by fire pretty badly.  <br>
<br>
To counter this each team stayed on top of each other so they got airbursted all together, and could decurse on the run back.  Found a couple vids where they used that so it seemed a viable option.  <br>
<br>
Would you suggest a more liberal spreading out, and decurser on that side(or other sides?)  just pick up the slack?  Should only one person be getting hit with airbursts per group(except melee of course)?</div>

<br>
Our strategy is 4 point, with each groups decurser being marked with a raid icon. Each group is instructed to stack on their decurser at all times.<br>
<br>
If a doomfire spawns in your quarter the entire group runs way. If a group member gets airburst the entire group gets punted. The idea behind this is so that no matter what the group sticks together, doesn't get spread out so no-one is ever out of range of decursing and heals.<br>
<br>
Key point with this strategy is make sure that at least one person in each group is a loudmouth on vent/teamspeak. That person needs to be yelling at his group to run away when a doomfire is heading their way and do so consistently and _early_.<br>

The first hour or so of each night is people remembering what they are doing.  Few deaths to craters, few deaths to doomfire, few deaths to curses.  Then we get that out of the way.  Then for the next few hours we die to a couple of different things.  The worst thing we are dealing with is MT death.  At some point during the fight, 2 groups are out with fire, one group got airbursted and the last group just cant hold the MT up.  Usually the first time this happens he uses his tricks to stay alive,t hen it happens again at some point and he dies.</div>

		<div id="post_message_582173">We have about a day and a half work in on him so far so I can't say with certainty that what we are doing is better.  But the first day we did have an issue with the MT dying, it pretty much ended every attempt we had.  What we ended up doing is having basically every hybrid in the raid throw on their healing gear.  The 8 normal healers in the raid had the sole job of healing the MT, the 3-4 hybrids that we had were solely responsible for their group.  We only had 2 shamans in the raid so we also had our shadow priests dps out of shadow form so they could mass dispel the fears quicker.  Lastly we also adjusted the 4 point positioning a bit by using only 180-270 degrees of the circle around Archimonde.  This allows for more cross-healing and it seemed more healers closer to the MT at all times as the 2 groups that were about even with Archimonde could run away from the doomfire yet still be in range of the tank.<br>
<br>
We did not have a single attempt after those changes end because of the MT dying.  The only issue now is that when a soul charge goes off there is a 3 second stun and people were getting overrun by the doomfire while stunned.  So basically once we get people better prepared for soul charges we should be able to down him, hopefully tonight.</div>

		<div id="post_message_582212">Lambach, part of the issue is that the "best" varies from guild to guild, so the most we can offer is what works for us, what failed for us and let people glean what they can for them.  The later bosses have a few "set" things (avoid doomfire, don't die from fall damage) but everything else is completely open.  That's why a lot of what you will see is re-hashing.  Yes, I read your original post and the follow up posts.  If you'll notice I added new information of what we do (again, this is just what worked for us, every guild is different.)  We stack more healers, have more healers per group and 1 healer with 2 instants in the middle.  I'm sorry that it doesn't give you a specific answer, but people can only offer you the information they have available.  <br>
<br>
Summary:<br>
1)  There is always 1 group in range of the tank, I'd expect this to hold true for 3 or 4 point strategies.  There are typically 2-3 healers per group.<br>
2)  There is always 1 healer with melee for decursing and healing on the MT. <br>
3)  Healing is honestly very light in this fight.  If people are taking doomfire, they're not running enough.<br>
4)  Keep a decurser always around your groups.  40 yard range means no one should die to Grip.<br>
5)  Track decursers (WWS, Recount) and make sure people aren't trying to sneak in DPS when people are dying to grip.  Decursing is a higher priority.<br>
6)  Cratering.  There is no excuse.  Give people a deadline to learn it, then replace them.  There is no reason for someone to crater.  Jump off cliffs and learn your latency to avoid "lag".<br>
<br>
You mention different things, I can't imagine what those would be.  If you have good magic decursers, put at least one in a tremor group and have them cleanse other healers who are feared, this should mitigate your tanks spikes during fears.  Other then that it's just practice.</div>

</div>Stop worrying about your MT healing until you fix this. <br>
<br>
Communication for doomfires and avoiding them is directly related to MT healing. If people get doomfires because the raid 'sucks at communication' then all those heals diverted off the MT to them will increase the chance your MT will die.  Thats not the healers fault, its the dps's. That fury warrior, who ate 16 doomfires - hes a good example of the problem guilds need to fix before they question their healers. Either the communication needs to be better to warn melee or the players themself are just too slow or too busy dpsing to notice doomfires around them (big no no).<br>
<br>
So if your MT dies thru lack of heals, its not necessarily a healer problem - it could very well be a dps-arent-avoiding-doomfires-enough problem.</div>

<br>
In reaction to mistakes that will make you, or someone else pay later, pay attention to what can/will be happening in the near future (fear cool down, uptime of PvP-trinket or abilities you might have).<br>
<br>
Bad luck is, when he and his abilities seem to after you most of the time and you spend more time on counter reacting than anything else.<br>
<br>
- If I get airbursted I look at that fear cool down and decide whether it's better to stay away and save that trinket cool down. The only time I can do decent dps is when that trinket is up, not worrying about fear. When he does fear I can get lucky and resist (which as a feral Druid happens a lot) or just don't get feared near some fire.<br>
<br>
- As soon as I used the insignia I switch to "extremely careful-mode" for as long as its on cool down and move to a safe location 10 seconds before fear cool down wears off.<br>
<br>
This is not really meant to be as guidance, only as example, that upon strategies, while learning Archimonde, raid members will develop class-specific behaviors of their own, all of which will improve progress on him. <br>

Later we got pretty cool about soulcharges as well.... a total of 7 dead on one kill still seems pretty much insane to me.</div>

The second night of attempts, we told the group that every death was avoidable, and they needed to treat them as such. They needed to do everything in their power to stay alive. For example, a rogue using COS to DPS and then getting doomfired 30 seconds later was an avoidable death, because he used his cooldown in a frivolous manner rather than using his cooldowns defensively. The same applied to PvP trinket usage, and various other examples. Try to stress the fact that death can always be prevented, and lay into people who die. It might facilitate better results.</div>

</div>When we learnt the fight I asked every person who died first (and second) on vent to explain in detail (to the whole raid listening) what killed them after the wipe. With 25 people listening closely, would you be a little embarrassed to admit to them that you died stupidly by saying "I cratered" or "I was feared into a doomfire and forgot to trinket "? Make it policy to ask the first death player on vent to explain how they died and talk about ways they could have avoided it. <br>
<br>
The other thing is for your raid leaders to realise 'It was bad luck' and 'there was nothing I could do' are not acceptable excuses for dying - they are simply a coverup for player mistakes almost all the time. Let the raid know that almost all deaths on Archimonde are the result of a player mistake. If your raid and raid leader believe Archimonde is just 'a luck fight' then expect lots of bad luck.<br>
<br>
<b>Use WWS:</b> Upload your full night of attempts and check which players used 'Super Healing Potions', 'Healthstones' and 'Purification potions' and 'Fire Protection Potions'. You could reward those players who do but more importantly - tell people that these pots should always be used if you risk dying. Also check on WWS who received the doomfire debuffs.<br>
<br>
I read another poster say he used bonus DKP for every soul charge they recovered from. I think this is a great idea, but we don't use DKP to try it  If your using dkp, you could also setup bonuses for all players that receive less than X number of doomfires for a night of attempts. Make sure you tell players not to suicide in them during wipes if you try this. If you gave an attractive DKP bonus for everyone who averaged less than X doomfires per Y attempts  - im sure it would be a nice incentive to people to avoid them just that little bit more.<br>
<br>
Also, if theres people that just cant learn the fight in a reasonable time - tell them they will have to sit out. Dont put 24 people through the pain of stupid wipes because nobodys got the guts to sit that 1 bad player out.</div>

		<div id="post_message_583961">We ended up giving negative DKP to everyone who cratered; that seemed to do the trick and cause people to use Tears of the Goddess early, rather than at the last minute, risking death. We have one shot Archi two weeks in a row now, the 4 corner strategy really holds people accountable and facilitates the learning process. If someone gets separated from his group and dies, it is his fault. Make sure your raiders know that every time they die first, it is their fault, and have them explain their death. <br>
<br>
The fight is just an accountability check. If everyone stays in their group and uses cooldown defensively, the learning curve isn't very severe.</div>

		<div id="post_message_587143">We use the 4 point strategy and have a couple kills under out belt with last week being a one shot (even had 1 Soul Charge).<br>
<br>
We had to spend about 2 full raids worth of time on him to get him down and the turning point was when I, as raid leader, told everyone to <b><i>not dps and just see if we can get to the 10 minute enrage.</i></b>  I wanted people to understand that surviving is the most important thing....even though I had said it a million times, it didn't register with some people for some reason.  After it appeared we could survive doomfires and air bursts and everything else, we had "light dps" attempts and killed him 3-4 pulls later.<br>
<br>
Here are some of the keys to us killing him:<br>
1-Full healthstones, Fire protection potions, Health potions, PVP Trinket---all necessary 100% of attempts...People need to learn to find ways to save their own ass at all costs.<br>
2-Shadow priests in healing gear and normal form only putting their DOTs up when it is "safe" to...Their fear wards and HOTs are more important here...If they're in MF'ing, they're going to wipe you....THIS ISN'T A DPS RACE.  Tell your shadow priests they are healers first and foremost and then putting occasional DOTs up if everyone around them is topped off.<br>
3-Communication is so incredibly important...if there is a doomfire even looking like it might go near melee, let them know way early.  You have to promote an aura of paranoia in everyone's head.<br>
4-We've yet to even come close to the enrage and 75-80% of our dps is from melee.  Ranged groups job(s) is to stay alive and try to "kite" the doomfires away.(Though it doesn't seem that the "kiting" works, melee can tell the difference of when ranged groups are side stepping doomfires or running/kiting them far away....Seriously)<br>
5-Soul Charge does not mean you're going to wipe...If someone dies, keep vent calm and immediately tell everyone to make sure everyone else is topped off and prepare to heal immediately after the Soul Charge/silence.  Our first kill had 3 Soul Charges and wasn't all that crazy even.  It's just a matter of your healers being ready and no one panicing and being ready to heal themself with potion/healstones/bandages...whatever it takes.<br>
6-FAST decursing.  There is no reason that curses should tick more than once on anyone in your raid.  No excuses here.  If you have a decurser that fails consistantly, then find a way to replace them.  This isn't a fight you can "carry" a bad player...especially in such a key position.  Our mages and moonkin are typically well under Main Tank dps because their primary responsibility is to decurse.<br>
<br>
Most importantly, do attempts with zero dps until everyone can survive until the enrage timer.  This will help your healers the most because healing on the main tank can be tricky if multiple groups are "out."  Once you can make it 10 minutes, add in melee dps and "light" ranged dps...You'll see him going down that night.</div>

</div>My advice would be to just give up on kiting the fire. Reliably kiting the fire is sketchy at best. I would still use a 3 or 4 points strat (just to keep people near de-cursers and healers and tremor totems) but tell the groups to just avoid Doomfires as best they can and if separated get back together asap. (We usually mark the mages/resto druids to help them stay together). This will also increase DPS on him by a noticeable margin.<br>
<br>
On a possibly unrelated note: We had to pry away from our mentality the preservation of group synergy in order to distribute tremor totems, de-cursers and healers. Trying to keep shadow priests with casters and dps warriors with enhancement shamans is nice if you can swing it, but giving each point the people it needs and keeping healers un-feared was a higher priority. Convert group synergy into survival groups instead of DPS/heal maxing groups.</div>

		<div id="post_message_593729">My guild started today finally on Archimonde, I have spoken with Tyrian a small bit on good stuff for tactics and such. But we are having major problems MT getting Airbursts because people running like scared chickens due to Doomfire. We use 4 point tactic but till now i don't think everyone still not gets it after 1 night of whiping so now my question is kind when ever a doomfire spawns and well its in a range pretty close to you but isnt moving yet or not moving towards you yet should you still already run? And we have had our melee dps get doomfire ofcourse we already had a kind of bad start due to not enough people and ending up taking 8 melee so we had 1 group less of 4 point tactic, is this a misake that it pretty much started/came at melee is our melee standing wrong or is our MT tanking him wrong? Then i would also like to know how others of you had your group setup we tonight had quite less healers just 8, i have read some posts saying to let shadow priests not get in shadowform or let people who can heal but arent that spec use healing gear. Would appreciate some tips on how others dealed with these problems. Thanks in advance.</div>

		<div id="post_message_594318">Yesterday we killed Archimonde after about 2 months (although we did focus on Black Temple, and only had 5-6 nights of solid attempts on Archimonde himself, so it's not as bad as it sounds). The kill was made using a tactic completely new to us, and it worked out perfectly for us.<br>
<br>
Before yesterday we always used the four point tactic. Now we had a kind of two point tactic. Archimonde is tanked in the middle of the big field, and west and east of him are two big groups with healers and decursers spread out between the groups. The big difference is that the two groups dont clump up like you do with the 4 point strategy. They spread out like a big "wall" west and east of the boss. Almost all fires went for someone in those groups, and almost none at all for the melee. Big plus about this strategy is that not 5 players get air burst at the same time, but only 2-3. The ones that get "targetted" by the Doomfire run back in a straight line, and so do the players close the person running backwards. This proved out to be very efficient, and the flames could be kited almost perfectly for some reason.<br>
<br>
First few attempts we had no healer in melee range, but we changed that after 2 attempts. We used a Holy priest in melee range focussing on the main tank and nothing else. The reason for using a Holy priest is simple: Binding Heal. In case he gets the Doomfire DOT he can Renew himself and heal the MT and himself with Binding Heal, so the MT keeps recieving heals even while he's healing himself. He himself and a shadowpriest could keep him out of fears almost permanently with Fear Ward and Trinket.<br>
<br>
We had Shadowpriests out of Shadowform, so they can not only dispell fears but also emergency heal. The 2 Shadowpriests did less than 500 DPS, but they saved quite some lives.<br>
<br>
We have a lack of Shamans, so we chose not to have a Shaman for the melee, since they have enough abilities to break fear (Trinket, Cloak of Shadows, Beserker Rage, Divine Shield). They lose some DPS because they won't get any totems, but in the end Archimonde was on 10% after 7,5 minute. So DPS was not really a problem.<br>
<br>
When a Fear is incoming, every moves away from any fires at least 30 yards. If they get feared and run towards a fire, they use their trinket or get dispelled. Trinkets are not for "Fear soon, im gonna stay right next to this pretty fire and pop my trinket immediately". Its for emergency use only.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<u>To Emtee:</u> If you have your MT getting airburst than either the Melee is to close to him, or people are running like chickens from flames. Tell them to turn around and move in a straight line backwards when a fire is following them. Not running around the boss, and definately not near the MT.</div>

		<div id="post_message_597961">We spent about 3 hours on Archimonde yesterday.  All were no-DPS attempts.  We had spent a few hours on him a few weeks ago.  We seem to run into two major problems:<br>
<br>
1.) The Shaman's tremor totem does not dispel fear 1 second after cast.  It does so instantly and then doesn't tick again for 4-5 seconds.  We tested this in the Nagrand arena.  This means the Shaman cannot drop the totem reactively when they see the cast bar.  Since the fear ward change, are people doing fear ward rotations?  The melee is so close to the fire spawn that any amount of time feared results in many dots.<br>
<br>
2.) When the doomfire curves, it usually results in not one but two groups having to move.  If both groups are standing far enough from the doomfire not to get feared into it, they are out of range of the tank.  If both active fires do this, it is very easy for all 4 groups being affected by this, leaving only melee healers in range of the tank (and still at the mercy of air burst).</div>

Regarding fear, you don't stand within 15 yards of a doomfire when fear cd is coming up and everyone wears their pvp trinket.<br>

</div>Thats why your melee group/enhancement shaman should be the recipiant of a full Fear Ward rotation. If you've only got 3 priests in the raid, give all the fear wards to the melee shaman. Then he can place his tremor totem reactively the moment after a fear is cast.<br>
<br>
The other heal/elemental shamans dont need FW, as players in their group can simply move 30-40 yards/~4-6 sec worth of running-time away from doomfires before a fear anyway, which should be standard practise for the rest of the raid.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">We spent about 3 hours on Archimonde yesterday.  All were no-DPS attempts.  We had spent a few hours on him a few weeks ago.  We seem to run into two major problems:<br>
<br>
1.) The Shaman's tremor totem does not dispel fear 1 second after cast.  It does so instantly and then doesn't tick again for 4-5 seconds.  We tested this in the Nagrand arena.  This means the Shaman cannot drop the totem reactively when they see the cast bar.  Since the fear ward change, are people doing fear ward rotations?  The melee is so close to the fire spawn that any amount of time feared results in many dots.<br>
<br>
2.) When the doomfire curves, it usually results in not one but two groups having to move.  If both groups are standing far enough from the doomfire not to get feared into it, they are out of range of the tank.  If both active fires do this, it is very easy for all 4 groups being affected by this, leaving only melee healers in range of the tank (and still at the mercy of air burst).</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>1. Stop relying on Tremor Totems to bail you out. Just stay away from Doomfire before potential Fears. Make sure everyone has DBM or a similar boss mod. Have your raid leader call out "Fear anytime." That's your raid's que to check their surroundings. If ranged DPS do their jobs, healers can focus on calling out Air Bursts, healing the MT and melee. Make sure people in your raid are wearing 2 minute PVP trinkets. I won't say it's a "must", but it makes a big difference, especially for healers.<br>
<br>
2. You can have an entire group out of healing range of the MT and be fine. The healing strategy here is really communication. We call out on Vent "So-and-so away" when our healers can't get back to the MT or when they get Air Bursted. It communicates urgency for the remaining healers to step their game up and pay extra attention to the MT. This is again why ranged DPS need to be very self sufficient in not taking Doomfires.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Thats why your melee group/enhancement shaman should be the recipiant of a full Fear Ward rotation. If you've only got 3 priests in the raid, give all the fear wards to the melee shaman. Then he can place his tremor totem reactively the moment after a fear is cast.<br>
<br>
The other heal/elemental shamans dont need FW, as players in their group can simply move 30-40 yards/~4-6 sec worth of running-time away from doomfires before a fear anyway, which should be standard practise for the rest of the raid.</div>

</div>Our guild does not give me a fear ward and typically what happens is that I will keep a tremor up at all possible times (there are truly sometimes where I was locked out of the middle for 2 minutes) and let the rogues take care of themselves (warriors can dance all fears and the healing/feral druid in the group can heal themselves through a bad fire), they have so many more abilites to counteract the doomfire than I do.  If they get a back tick or their trinket is on cooldown they can cloak anyway.  It is possible to still have melee that don't get killed by doomfires constantly, but it requires them to be paying more attention than the ranged (as always.)  In my personal case the general rule of thumb is that if my trinket isnt up, I am already running out of the middle 5s before fear for the safety of the logs.<br>
<br>
That said, I would love to be the target of a fear ward rotation anyway, but it is entirely possible to do it without one.  Tremor totems in this manner are largely about luck, sometimes it will tick nearly instantly, sometimes you will have to wait the full 5s pulse, the best any shaman can do is make it ALWAYS a 3.5 second break (instantly drop at the cast of a fear + no lag + instant reaction times.)  I also tinkered with seeing if the first tick was delayed in any way but was also unable to break a fear with my totem during a warlock fear cast.</div>

</div>Nobody disputes that - but much of the Archimonde fight is about minimising potential risks. Is it possible to do it without FW's on melee-group shaman? Yes. Is it a smart thing to do? No.<br>
<br>
Melee having to be at the mercy of the '5 second tremor tick' when doomfires are literally behind them is just asking for trouble. Yes, rogues have good survival tricks in case things go wrong - but you want to minimise the number of potential times something <i>can</i> go wrong which force people to use abilities like Cloak of Shadows. Knowing theres a risky/dangerous situatiaon and having the mentality 'well rogues can just cloak if needed' is like trying to fill a leaking bucket. Fix the real problem first.</div>

</div>I think most people forget this in the constant epeen waving contest - or perhaps just in being naturally argumentative.<br>
If we were perfect, no one would ever wipe - and we wouldn't even have this thread.<br>
<br>
You minimize risk by weighting your circumstances - fear ward helps you out a lot if used appropriately.<br>
<br>
This is the entire idea behind min/maxing.<br>
<br>
You can get away with hybrid setups, or something in-between, but that doesn't mean that you should - or rather that it is the path of least resistance.  <br>
<br>
I'm sure people have beaten archimonde with 0 fear wards, 0 shamans, maybe no warriors, and 6 healers.  But the last thing we need is to discuss the merits of doing that.  Why would you do that unless you didn't have a choice?</div>

		<div id="post_message_601059">We'll be using a Fear Ward rotation this week.  Leaving the melee to their own devices sounds great when its all Warriors and Rogues, but we have at least 1 feral, 1 paladin, and 1 resto in melee range.  We use a method described in this thread of having a Paladin in the totem group, then dispelling the resto druid.<br>
<br>
No one really answered my second question, but I think the answer is that we simply need to be more aggressively positioned when his Fear is on cooldown, then resume cautious positioning about 10 seconds before the cooldown is up.  We were being extra cautious the entire time, which resulted in more groups being outside of healing range then were probably necessary.</div>

</div>We just started this encounter last night and after about 10 wipes we decided to retire for the evening. What I can say is that Tremor Totem <b>CAN</b> be a viable tool for this encounter if utilized properly. Dropping the Totem as Archie casts Fear will not help much if at all. The Fear spell is a 1.5 second cast. The totem doesn't "PULSE" (IE dispel fear) until after 4 seconds. If you drop it as he's casting, your group is going to be feared for 2.5 seconds. Which in a fight like this is an eternity. If, as a Shaman, you can time your totem right, meaning when you see the BW warning "Fear Cooldown over" drop your Tremor Totem then. Your group will stand a better chance at getting the fear dispelled almost immediately. There were several instances where, when I timed my Totem dropping right, the melee group was feared for less than a second.<br>
<br>
The last few attempts we also, as a melee group, stood right under Archies rear end. Within the raid target circle to be exact. And while I thought that "Hey this might not be a good idea because of the possibility of MT getting Air bursted", it proved to be beneficial in that none of the doomfires hit us. Granted they were all around us and one poorly timed Fear would have ended our DPS, which made it all that more important to make sure Totem Pulsing was spot on. We ran with 3 UD Rogues (PvP trinket WotF, TT), Me, Orc Enhancement Shaman (PvP Trinket, TT), and a Fury Tauren WAR (IMMUNITY FTW). I got Air bursted once during that strat, but the MT didn't.</div>

		<div id="post_message_601209">I don't know if thats really viable, because the fear cooldown is over just means he can use fear now. It doesn't mean he will use fear now. It is variable. Which means dropping it could mean the next fear breaks instantly. It could also mean that its a 4 second tremor. If the timing was precise than the fight could be handled easily. But it can't be. Which means yeah, use tremor as a backup. You just move away from flames. The advantage of tremor is not that it takes away fear, it just means the groups with it can get back to healing the MT quicker because they're not mindlessly running around for a huge amount of time.</div>

		<div id="post_message_601506">Just got our first kill last night, and thanks to all of those here for suggestions and information.  This is more an execution fight than anything else, so it can be difficult to see that you are actually making progress.<br>
<br>
Your fear wards should go on those people who can make the best use of them.  In our case because we had a lot of melee dps (6.5) we had 11 people in the centre (split across 2 positions to minimise collective air bursts) and used the fear wards on the MT group resto shaman, who dropped the totem to cleanse the fear from a resto druid, a feral druid in hybrid gear and a holy paladin.  That gave us enough healing to heal through what doomfire that managed to hit on the rest of the melee (We had a couple of doomfires charge through the melee area on the kill).  That way we could still preserve our standard melee dps group.</div>

		<div id="post_message_601949">Awright, my turn to ask for advice.<br>
<br>
We got him down to 21% and then had a cascasding soulcharge on 3 healers.<br>
<br>
We use the 4 point strategy. Each group is self-sufficient, healer/decurser. The exception is group 2 (melee). We have a resto druid from group 1 stand with group 2 to decurse them.<br>
<br>
1 MT - Prot War<br>
6 Melee (2 rog, 1 druid, 1 ret paladin, 1 feral druid, 1 enh shaman)<br>
10 healers (3 shamans, 2 priests, 2 resto druids, 3 paladins)<br>
2 hunters, 3-4 mages, 1 shadow priest, 1 warlock, 2 hunters.<br>
<br>
Group 1= MT, mage, resto druid (decurse group 2, sits with group 2), holy priest (MT Healer), holy paladin(MT Healer).<br>
Group 2= Melee Rogue, Rogue, Ret Paladin, Fury Warrior, Enh Shaman<br>
Group 3 = Holy priest (MT healer), Mage, Resto Shaman, Hunter, Holy Paladin (MT Healer)<br>
Group 4 = Shadow priest, Mage, Resto Shaman, Hunter, Holy Paladin (MT Healer)<br>
Group 5 = Resto Shaman (heals melee), Mage, Resto Druid, Feral Druid, Warlock<br>
<br>
<br>
So here's the problem.<br>
<br>
Group 5 and 3 are getting hit with a lot of doomfires. When they have a doomfire on them, they have to run parallel to the mountain, but for some reason or another, they still end up getting hit with a lot of doomfires. They just don't have enough room to move.  Group 1 and 4 don't have this problem because they don't have to run parallel to either mountain. <br>
<br>
I just don't know why group 5 had so much problem with doomfire.<br>
<br>
Group 1's biggest problem is since they didn't have a tremor totem, if they got feared + cursed, they were pretty much guaranteed to die. I'm not sure about the best way to address that.<br>
<br>
This is the positioning diagram we use.<br>
<br>
We initially tanked him right around the stumps, but we found they ended up blocking doomfire and making it do weird things. Once we moved him closer to the mountains, doomfire was easier to manage, except for group 5.<br>
<br>

<br>
And here's the log from tonight. Arctia is the resto shaman in group 5. He was pretty high on doomfires. His job was tougher because I assigned him to be the melee DPS healer as well. Bizzara was the resto druid in group 5, and he too was getting hit a lot.<br>

</div>If your ingame position is just like your picture, your putting him a little too close to the mountain, cramping some groups and group 5 almost can get cornered/trapped. Heres a pic to show how much easier the run path is for Group 1/4 if you shift the whole raid to the left. They basically run back to the mountain then parallel along it - shouldnt be a problem at all.<br>

<br>
Im not sure if you posted your wws report so people could comment on it - but out of curiousity I had a little look anyway at some key indicators on Archimonde and thought id comment - I hope you dont mind.  Your WWS records 21 attempts. <br>
<br>
 - Doomfires: Looking at who takes doomfire damage over the course of those attempts we get this: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304071901/http://wowwebstats.com/ypjxqti1tkvpu?ab=144" target="_blank">Wow Web Stats</a>  . Fifteen people took more than 25 doomfires each (Yes I know people sometimes suicide in them in wipes, but still thats more doomfires than attempts) while the top 2 paladins took ~33 - something is wrong there.  Were the top doomfire-paladins in group 5?  <br>
<br>
- Healthstones: For the entire night of 21 attempts, 13 people used less than 5 healthstones and 8 people only used one healthstone - <i>in twenty one attempts</i>. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304071901/http://wowwebstats.com/ypjxqti1tkvpu?ab=197" target="_blank">Wow Web Stats</a>   . If survival is the key - people are being way too light in their healthstone usage and selfsurvival consumables. I can see on your WWS you only have one warlock in the raid - so that might limit the number of healthstones you had available between attempts a bit, so lets check the next two major pots to see if people compensate for a lack of available healthstones with other means (which they should)<br>
<br>
- Super Healing Potions Usage: For the <b>Entire</b> night of attempts, only 9 people used a Super healing potion. Only two people used more than two over the course of the night. Thats not good.<br>
<br>
- Fire protection potion usage: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304071901/http://wowwebstats.com/ypjxqti1tkvpu?ab=196" target="_blank">Wow Web Stats</a>   10 people used fire pots over the night, but only two people used more than 3. If people used Healing potions instead itd be ok, but that wasnt happening.<br>
<br>
- Purification (self-decurse) potion usage: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304071901/http://wowwebstats.com/ypjxqti1tkvpu?ab=290" target="_blank">WWS Loading...</a>  5 people used decurse pots over the night <br>
<br>
===<br>
<br>
So while we can look into your positioning and strat to make it easier for groups to avoid doomfire - your bigger problem is players simply arent trying hard enough to stay alive. Nobody can really say that, in 21 attempts while you learn the fight, using one super healing potion or one healthstone is accepable. I count about 7 attempts you had where over 1 million damage was done to the boss - surely all 7 of those attempts were worth potting to attempt to stay alive or  recover from soul charges? Looks like people potted maybe for one of them , two at most.  Make sure players know that using consumables and pots to stay alive isnt 'nice', its a <i>requirement</i> for the fight. Check WWS after and point fingers and ask questions at players who seem to be slacking.<br>
<br>
If people dont want to pot in the first place when they are in danger, your going to keep wiping - regardless of where you decide to tank the boss. However if you can get the boss to 21%, a kill should be forthcoming. Whether its easily repeatable the following week - is another story </div>

				<strong>1st Kill Strats</strong>

		<div id="post_message_602218">After reading this forum for hours or end and applying the tips here, we got our first Archimonde kill after only 3 hours of attempts on our first night.  I appreciate all the people who took their time to post strats in here, and for the guilds who are upcoming on him I'd like to highlight the ideas that were incredibly useful. <br>
<br>
1.  We ran a 4 point strategy and positioned him the same as Tyrian posted above.<br>
<br>
2.  We raid with a lot of shamans in general (Enh sham and 3 restos as is a lot of raid healing in BC encounters).  Therefore we had totems in 4 of the five groups. <br>
<br>
3.  Group without the totem were filled with Undead classes w/ 2 min pvp trinkets. <br>
<br>
4.  Fear wards were used to bail us out of bad situations.  Ie. Someone got cut off by a doomfire or somehow ended up surrounded by them, they could call out for a fear ward to prevent getting feared into a doomfire if their CD's for breaking the fear were down.  Fear wards are a life saver, going forward I'm going to ask our raiders to shout out when they need the fear ward so they can avoid a wipe.  We need to utlize this more going forward.<br>
<br>
5. For MT healing, it was never an issue. 1 resto druid keeping up HoTs, 1 holy paly and 1 holy priest all in different groups.  Arch never came close to killing me as the whole night I never died to cause a wipe.  At one point reading I thought since Arch couldn't crush a druid would be a good choice to tank the fight, but imo Az'galor output more damage than Arch does.  Arch's attacks on me were easy to heal as he didn't have much burst capability. I was stacked in pure stam/avoidance gear, and no TPS gear.  <br>
<br>
6.  Other groups helped each other out by letting them know ahead of time doomfire was coming for them.  As MT I tried like hell to see doomfires coming to the melee from behind them to try and help them out. <br>
<br>
Doomfires did get hectic but we will be able to work on that.  I cannot stress enough how important it is to have the groups run away from the doomfires when the fear is incoming, as the totems were a huge help BUT are not the end all be all.  However, they do help you save your CD when they pulse at the right time. <br>
<br>
His abilities are very easy to survive and avoid.  I understand our kill is nothing like pre-nerfed Arch, but once again thanks forf the tips guys.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">If people dont want to pot in the first place when they are in danger, your going to keep wiping - regardless of where you decide to tank the boss. However if you can get the boss to 21%, a kill should be forthcoming. Whether its easily repeatable the following week - is another story </div>

</div>Thank you very much for that analysis Tyrian, it's given me and my guild a lot to think about.<br>
<br>
Part of reason people didn't pot/hs a lot is that most of the people who took damage were either melee, or in groups 1 or 5 in our original diagram. (Or NE and NW corners, assuming world tree is W) For example, Davidthorne was the warrior in melee group, and he took 15 FR pots, according to WWS. But I was in group 4, and I took almost no damage. I think I only got hit by doomfire once, so my healthstone was never consumed.<br>
<br>
This does indicate to me that I can drop one healer and go 9 healer instead of 10 healer. ee<br>
<br>
I think if we move further away from the mountain as you suggest, group 1+5 (the sides closest to the mountain), should have fewer problems with doomfire. Those two groups probably took over 60% of the heals for the fight. My only concern is that the stump in the middle can still make doomfire act even more erratic by blocking it.<br>
<br>
Also, I decided that the MT group, since it doesn't have a tremor totem, will have all high-survival or fear-breaking classes. Which means moving the fury warrior from melee group to tank group. We had too many problems with tank group getting feared + cursed and no way to break it. I figure MT, DPS War, paladin, frost mage, warlock should be a good MT group.<br>
<br>
As for purification pots, my raiders said that the pots got resisted a lot, and preferred to use FR or health pots intead. <br>
<br>
Hopefully we'll get to Archimonde in time tonight to try out the positioning you suggested. Otherwise tomorrow for sure.</div>

</div>Thats the thing - people who telling you this are either being misleading or outright lying. You only have to look at WWS to see most people use 1-2 healthstones/superhealing/fr potions and a significant amount of people use 0 healing pots over <i>twenty-one attempts</i>.  If people felt they were so safe, had no risk of dying and no reason to pot more than once or twice = Archimonde shouldve been dead.</div>

</div>Had another night of attempts on Archimonde, only 7 tries though since we were doing a full clear. Best we got was around 50%.<br>
<br>
Consumable usage seemed low still too, but when I brought it up melee said the logs were inaccurate. One person told me he used a health pot injector, but the logs don't record this. Either he's lying, or I didn't have enough log information from the melee. I'm going with the latter. Tonight I'll make sure to get WWS logs from someone in melee range.<br>
<br>
Also tonight we're going to amp magic on the MT and keep up CoE instead of CoR.<br>
<br>
Tonight's the night, though. People were tired last night, but tonight we're going in with no trash and everyone fully aware.<br>
<br>
We did try the positioning you suggested Tyrian, and it seemed pretty smooth. <br>
<br>
There were only two issues left to tweak.<br>
<br>
I have a shaman in the upper right-hand quadrant (along the mountain, away from the well) heal the melee group. He said it was difficult for him at times because he had to go in closer than his group did, making it harder for him to consistently break their fears. It also made it harder for him to consistently heal the melee group. I think the only thing I can tell him to do is just have his entire group come in closer.<br>
<br>
MT healers said it was easier for them to get hit by doomfire vs the rest of their group, because they had to be closer to the MT than the rest of their group in order to keep up heals. <br>
<br>
I did notice that the # of people getting hit by doomfire was a lot less than our last attempt though, so people are starting to get it now. We also had a few deaths because a healer/decurser was too far from someone, but this was always due to bad communication within the group. <br>
<br>
Here's the WWS logs from last night for comparison purposes:<br>

		<div id="post_message_603765">This guild on my server recently had their first archimonde kill.

What happened next was that the server came down hard on them about their use of a certain Log to exploit the fight, which they adamantly defended that they were in fact being creative and not exploitive in anyway.  To "prove" themselves, they went to D&amp;R forums as well as submitted a ticket ingame with a GM to ask.  Of course the GM said that it was not considered an exploit.  I am quite curious what you guys think.  Exploit or no?</div>

</div>Its an exploit. <br>
<br>
If people want to argue over semantics, its a unintended way of doing the fight - clearly not the way the designers wanted (regardless of whether the so-called gm used the specific word 'exploit'). People are <i>meant</i> to be having doomfires them harass them during the fight - not have archimonde in the middle of a massive 200 yard field just to huddle up on/behind a tiny log to trivialise that mechanic. Its like the original tank spot for Archimonde (underwater, below the world tree), you could call it 'creative' if you really want to  - but it was obviously unintended and fixed when word got out.</div>

</div>No, the video that was posted 2 posts ago. They tank Archi on one side of the log and the raid stands on the other. The doomfires have to go around the log and it basically makes a safe spot for the raid to stand.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_604574"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Definitely an exploit, back in naxx days, there were some safe spots on Heigan that you could use to avoid the dance, they gave some warnings to guilds exploiting it and fixed it some patch later. They don't bother hotfixing those tho it seems, since you still need to get to archimonde, tank him, and do some stuff. It's an exploit, but hardly gamebreaking. You could argue that archimonde is supposed to be real hard or something, but he's been nerfed so much, we killed him in 4tries, without any specific positionning strat. You can easily heal 4-5people taking doomfires for the whole fight with HoTs, plus the tank and the curse first ticks.<br>
<br>
Edit: Since it seems I haven't "proved" what I said enough and got a warning for it, I'll make a few corrections. First, it was actually 6tries, my bad, it just was way too fast in my opinion anyway. We do have a positionning strat, that's like 3general groups, but people spread out all over the place once the fight starts really, and it seems pretty chaotic to me, at least compared to the diagrams and all the stuff that's been posted. You can however outheal doomfires easily, I ran a few times into them to be in range for decurses, knowing I could just keep myself alive with hots and still not run out of mana.<br>
And here's the WWS: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080413150215/http://wowwebstats.com/sujng1e5d5plm" target="_blank">Wow Web Stats</a>.<br>
<br>
That was our first kill, and this week we killed it again, THIS time in 4tries, one of which I wiped at around 40% because my icons weren't locked, so when I went to click the tear I actually dragged it, then crashed into the ground ^^.<br>
<br>
Was I happy we killed it fast? Yeah. Did it feel even close to my chtun first kill? Hell no. But the point of my post was more about the exploit thing, I guess I should have abstained of sharing my experience with T6 content.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Definitely an exploit, back in naxx days, there were some safe spots on Heigan that you could use to avoid the dance, they gave some warnings to guilds exploiting it and fixed it some patch later. They don't bother hotfixing those tho it seems, since you still need to get to archimonde, tank him, and do some stuff. It's an exploit, but hardly gamebreaking. You could argue that archimonde is supposed to be real hard or something, but he's been nerfed so much, we killed him in 4tries, without any specific positionning strat. You can easily heal 4-5people taking doomfires for the whole fight with HoTs, plus the tank and the curse first ticks.</div>

Back to the video, it really amuses me how people can justify all sorts of stuff as "creative" when it's blatantly unintended and an exploit. Let me see... end of zone boss fight, but it's trivial if we all stand on one spot and line-of-sight his main raid-killing ability - that's not an exploit at all is it? /sarcasm<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_604791"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->That's incorrect. Blizzard has always been very particular about how LoS works in raid bosses.<br>
<br>
i) If you can hit the boss and the boss can't hit you, it's an exploit. (Archimonde)<br>
<br>
ii) If you can't hit the boss and he can't hit you, it's not an exploit (Firemaw, Chromagus). <br>
<br>
Indeed, on Chromagus if you did hit him through the walls it made you vulnerable to his breaths, so it was clearly designed with that in mind. For Arhcimonde however, you are making yourself immune to this doomfires without interfering with your own ability to hit him in any way.<br>
<br>
I am curious how the raid isn't destroyed by airbursts however. (cannot download file).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_605523"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->2nd night, 20 wipes. :-(<br>
<br>
13% wipe too. That's right. We hit 13% with 23 up and hit the enrage timer.<br>
<br>
Not enough DPS due to:<br>
<br>
1) Not enough shamans meant dps groups were extra paranoid about being near doomfire or other groups before fears<br>
We've been doing this with 4 shamans, we were down to 3 last night (2 at some points), and learning this fight is really challenging without shamans. I did almost no dps because I wanted to make sure I didn't get feared/doomfired (and I still screwed up a few times).<br>
<br>
2) The shamans we did have blew heroims in the wrong groups (blowing it on a healer group vs melee group, for example). <br>
<br>
This is a video one of our resto shamans made of our 13% wipe.. He was in the melee group for decursing.<br>

<br>
It was frustrating, and after that it was hard to get people to focus again. We're going to take a break, let people get some consumables and farm and go back on Monday.<br>
<br>

<br>
Just looking at the logs, I'm still seeing a lot of what Tyrian posted, which is people aren't surviving. A lot of the people who got doomfired didn't pop healthstones or FR pots. I think healers in particular were lazy, assuming they can heal themselves through it. We also had paladins/mages pop their shields/blocks at the first tick of a doomfire instead of saving it for being feared into a doomfire or some other oh shit.<br>
<br>
And finally, a huge problem, healers weren't focused enough. Looking at the logs, I assigned 4 MT healers and 5 raid healers But the MT healers took a ton of damage. Most of them healed themselves for about 10% of the amount they healed the MT. One even wasted time healing a pet. Only one MT healer focused on healing the MT, the others were pretty much cross-healing like mad.<br>
<br>
At this point, I don't think there's any more strategy or tips I can tell people except do your own job and stop trying to do other peoples' jobs.<br>
<br>
Here's hoping for Monday.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I'll take the hit on the 13% enrage wipe. I didn't pay attention to the timer. I was too hyped over getting past 20%.<br>
<br>
I was the shadow priest, and my problem was I was in group 1, which is on the NW quadrant, the one near the world tree and the mountain. I had 2 holy priests, a hunter, and a mage with me. The last two nights I had an ele shaman for tremor totems. So tonight I just encourage our entire group to stay out unless there was no doomfire or fear incoming. I ended up spending most of the time just healing my group anyway.<br>
<br>
If we can't get another shaman, I think I'll spec holy and get another dpser in.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the suggestion on what to do on the last minute. Next time, I'll keep that in mind.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_605789"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->If you are short on Shaman:<br>
<br>
Make sure the melee dps group gets one and put your Resto Druid in that group for it too.<br>
Put any "spare" dps Warriors in any group you like. Fear shouldnt ever be an issue for them and if they are good they can Intercept out of the Air Burst too - they will take the damage but can get straight back to the boss without the knockback. this helps DPS a huge amount (much more than "optimizing" their group at the expense of others). We don't particularly optimize his group, but our Fury Warrior tops dps on this fight every single time.<br>
Set up a Fear Ward rotation on the MT so that he doesnt have to worry about stance-dancing or rely on the Shaman totem as a backup.<br>
<br>
We got our first kill with a single Shaman. Yes it's easier with more, but focus on the classes that really NEED a totem i.e classes/races that only have the PvP trinket to break Fear.<br>
It's also worth mentioning to your Shaman that Archimonde will never Fear while someone is Airbursted, at least in our experience - knowing this, totem-dropping becomes a lot easier.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_606241"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->It was my guild's first night of tries on Archimonde last night, and we went at it for about 4 hours and countless wipes. Best we got him was 65%, after that it seems as if people started to loose focus. Its possible that me and the other leaders are to blame for that because we insisted on doing more and more tries so that everyone gets used to the fight. <br>
<br>
Anyway, we first tried the "strategy" that was posted above, with positioning the entire raid behind the tree log to avoid doomfires. Has anyone else tried this for serious kill attempts aside from that one guild that killed him that way? Because it wasnt really working for us. Doomfires would either spawn behind us (i.e right in the raid) or they would circle around the log and hit us. Eventually we decided that especially for learning the fight this wasnt optimal and we switched to the 4 group strategy. <br>
<br>
I think part of the problem that caused alot of people to eat doomfires is that 2 groups were somewhat blocked by the mountains. So we have to work on our positioning and movement. Also part of the problem was that during fears the MT would not get enough heals.<br>
<br>
I've been reading alot of the posts here, and they have been incredibly helpful. I'm just wondering if theres any additional suggestions for ensuring the MT gets enough heals during Fear. Priests fearwarding themselves and each other kinda stopped during the chaos of everyone dodging fires, dont ask me how. <br>

</div>I stay out of shadowform and fearward my groups healer, I also wear the BT neck piece for extra SR and tend to resist a lot  of the fears and can dispel others quickly in range.  We tend to be priest heavy with 2-3 SPs and 2-3 holy, so there are a lot of fearwards to go around. <br>
<br>
Our guild was a little stuck on archimonde and tried the log strategy but the melee had a horrible time staying alive with it, it seems to almost favor stacking ranged behind the log with little to no melee.  After two hours of attempts, we went back to a 4-pt strategy and got a kill in 3 pulls.<br>
<br>
Personally, it felt better getting the kill without using an environmental shield.  If the log is removed, we know we have a strategy that will hold up.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I'm pretty sure that almost all doomfires are avoidable. There are many occasions where I'll be up near the melee and a doomfire spawns right on me, but as long as I stop whatever I'm doing and quickly strafe out of it I avoid taking damage/getting the debuff.<br>
<br>
Does that mean it's possible for melee to take 0 doomfires? Maybe, but in our 2 kills and 100+ attempts it hasn't happened . I will say though that for the most part the only melee that still get doomfired consistently are the ones we know to be a little slow(not just this encounter but in general as player). Make sure melee are communicating with each other, our melee almost always call out every doomfire that spawns somewhat near them.<br>
<br>
As for the MT getting doomfired, just have him back up/side step a little and tell him to let the melee know he's moving the boss.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Of course, we tend to bring plenty decursers, so I've only had to try for myself twice, but both times without luck.

<br>
As a side note, the Tree Log strategy did not work too well for us since people were closer together and there was a higher chance of someone taking fire damage if a doomfire would get through.<br>
The 4 point split proved to be the most effective and safe way to kill this big dude.<br>

It seems the fires are swooping in on melee and while the rogues CoS and the healers keep themselves and attempt to keep me up i am burning away. If i get airburst or grip its game over for me. I never get feared due to berserker rage but that isn't really the problem. I am currently using using healthstones and health pots but it just doesn't seem to be enough. Though all of this i am topping the charts on dps doing 10-12% of the overall damage while trying to be as safe as possible. <br>
<br>
For the next attempt i am gonna try to get to about 14k health using pvp gear and hoping that will help.<br>
<br>
In addition here is a list of what i have learned from this thread so far. i am going to implement this on the next set of attempts so i can get the damn casters off my back. if i was standing 30 meters away from the fight i wouldn't ever die either.<br>
<br>
1.Flask of Petrifaction<br>
2.Restoration potion<br>
3. Intercepting the boss after airburst (i can't believe i didn't think of this)<br>
4. Nightmare seeds<br>

		<div id="post_message_609069">DPS warriors are one of the easiest classes to survive with on this fight. This is what makes it easy to stay alive:<br>
<br>
1) Can reliably break every fear (never, ever get feared into doomfire)<br>
2) Can (usually) intercept after air bursts, meaning you rarely get far away from the raid<br>
3) Are standing in the middle (read: in range of every healer/decurser at all times)<br>
4) Cannot get hit by doomfires unless they loop around completely (if you stand close enough to the boss and/or watch for spawns, you won't get hit)<br>
5) If you do get hit by a doomfire that loops all the way around, you can instantly mitigate a large amount of damage by going to defensive stance and eating a healthstone/pot if needed.<br>
<br>
If you're getting grip and it's not being dispelled immediately while standing in range of every decurser in the raid, that's not your fault. The only thing you can do to play better is avoid doomfires, which should be easy.</div>

		<div id="post_message_609103">We've been working on this guy now since mid December.  As the MT, I am getting bored to tears with the fight-pun sort of intended I suppose.  I can execute this fight with my eyes closed, never get feared, and trinket my way through rough spots without having to think about it.  I feel like I'm farming MC for bindings here at this point.<br>
<br>
Our problem is with the rest of our raid.  We are playing on a backwater expansion server; we are the only guild in BT and MHJ, and many of our raiders should probably be playing Hello Kitty Island Adventure.<br>
<br>
We use a 4 corners strategy that is well defined and quite standard.  We use 4 ranged groups with 2 healers per group where possible.  Hopefully we have a shaman in each group, and if not a priest for fearward/mass dispel.  Still, we consistently lose people to doomfire and cratering.  We have never gotten this guy past 40%.  We made it to the enrage timer once when I yelled a lot and instructed people to not dps at all.  We have probably put in between 150 and 250 tries over the last month or so.  We have thoroughly researched the fight.  Everyone has been told ad nauseam about running directly away from Archimonde at the first sight of nearby doomfire, as well as everything else that they should be doing.<br>
<br>
Well, I've had it so I wrote up these rules.  Can you suggest any revisions that could make the policy more effective?  Are they too brutal/not brutal enough?<br>
<br>
<b>New Archimonde Rules</b><br>
<br>
Every time we attempt Archimonde, we will now make a note any time someone dies early.  Here are the rules associated with dying early on this encounter.<br>
<br>
<b>Cratering</b><br>
1) If you crater, you will get a second chance. <br>
2) If you crater twice, you will be removed from the raid for the night. <br>
3) If you crater repeatedly on different nights, you will be blacklisted from the Archimonde fight until it's on farm status.<br>
<br>
We will keep a "crater list" for this purpose.  We will run with under 25 if necessary.  If too many people crater twice, and we can no longer make attempts, the raid will either be called or redirected to another instance.<br>
<br>
We will recruit a replacement for anyone who is blacklisted from cratering.  Falling on trees is not an excuse, you should be looking down and hitting the tear early if you are falling on top of wooded areas.<br>
<br>
<b>Doomfire</b><br>
1) If you die early from doomfire once, you get a second chance. <br>
2) If you die early from doomfire twice, you are removed from the raid for the night. <br>
3) If you die from doomfire twice on multiple nights, you will be blacklisted from the Archimonde fight until it is on farm status. <br>
<br>
We will keep a "doomfire list".  If you die from doomfire, you should consider equipping stamina gear and chugging fire protection pots every 2 minutes.  Note: You can use flasks of petrification to not get blacklisted from doomfire.  If you are too lazy to get petrification pots, or too slow to use them, that's not our problem.  As with cratering, anyone who doomfired themselves repeatedly will be recruited over.<br>
<br>
<b>2 Minute PvP Trinket</b><br>
It's now required.  If you don't have one, you are now a second stringer for the Archimonde fight and will get last dibs on loot from the encounter regardless of your dkp.<br>
<br>
<b>Purification Potions, Flasks of Petrification, Fire Protection Pots or Healing Pots</b><br>
These are all required.  If you failed to bring any of these items, people who did win Archimonde loot over you regardless of your dkp.<br>
<br>
<b>Putting in your time</b><br>
Just like on Kael'thas, the people who put in the most effort and do a good job on Archimonde will become first stringers.  People who half ass the encounter, crater, get doomfired, or come unprepared will be recruited over.</div>

		<div id="post_message_609120">I would say ease up on the trinket requirement.  It's nice to have, but by no means a necessity.  I would never bench someone who has proven themselves to be good at surviving on the fight just because they didn't have the 2 minute trinket.  <br>
<br>
If they're dying, then it doesn't matter if they have the 2 minute trinket or not. <br>
<br>
Your potion requirement seems really high too.  Then again, if you carry them and don't use them, it doesn't cost anything.<br>
<br>
I typically only end up using a healthstone or two in case I get air burst while low health. <br>
<br>
In your situation I would definitely say your focus should be on keeping alive more than anything (obviously).<br>
<br>
Hammer into people's heads that if you're near a doomfire when a fear is coming, and you don't have a way to break fear, or remove the doomfire, then get the hell away from it.  Even if it puts you out of position.<br>
<br>
Get your cleansers to help cleanse other groups when necessary.  Your raiders should be moving away from doomfire at all costs.  Occasionally that will mean they get separated from their groups, and thus decursers.  This means they need coverage from another group's decurser.<br>
<br>
Cratering is unacceptable, and there's not much you can do about it other than removing people who consistently do it.  Some people take a few tries to be comfortable using it.  Make those people practice off a cliff or something.  It is different of course getting flung up than it is jumping down.  I normally do it more based off timing now than visual queues, since sometimes it's hard to see your character, but you know that if you hit the tears x seconds after the apex of your jump you should be fine anywhere.<br>
<br>
Also keep a positive outlook.  It sounds like you're being pretty harsh, which is understandable, it's a frustrating fight.  But a lot of it is about confidence in the fight.  You sound like you're pretty close to it, and once you get him down the first time, he becomes immensly easier, despite the fact that you WILL wipe again on him on subsequent resets.  <br>
<br>
If your raid can get him to 40%, they can get him to 10%.  There is nothing different about the first 60% from the last 30%.  It is just more of the same.  It's just about maintaining that focus the entire time.</div>

</div>First of all, why are you dying to air burst?  That makes no sense.<br>
<br>
2nd of all, make sure your decursers know who is responsible for melee decursing.<br>
<br>
3rd.  Really, if you are paying attention for incoming doomfires(ie panning the camera arround, and LOOKING for them) you should never ever be hit by one as a dps warrior.  Stop looking at your buttons, and start looking at your environment.<br>
<br>
Communication can help with a lot of these issues.  Ranged people warning the melee that a rogue Doomfire is inc can provide a critical warning.  Melee people who get gripped speaking up in vent can help make decursers aware.  Healing groups getting cut off by doomfires and letting the rest of the raid know can help let other healers know when they need to steo up, etc.  Its a fight where good communication can really help things out.<br>
<br>
Yes, melee dps really do dominate the meters on this fight.  But, if your melee doesnt pay attention, and healers need to stop healing the MT to heal dumb dps who cant/arent avoiding doomfires then you put your MT at tremendous risk.</div>

<br>
2 dead. One enh shaman due to hitting tear too soon and landing with 1k hp then getting 1 tick of doomfire. 1 Warrior who got separated from his airbursted deurser dying to curse. <br>

Healed through both.<br>

One hunter who dc-ed halfway through.<br>
<br>
Crazy airbursts. Melee spent half of the time in the air.<br>

50 seconds til enrage tank shield walls. All dps goes crazy. <br>
<br>
20 seconds before enrage he hits 10%.<br>

</div>It's not excessive, here's why:<br>
<br>
The fight is 100% about personal accountability. If you die, it's your fault. Putting this clause in there basically means there can be no excuse. You COULD have survived if you were overprepared - or if you simply paid attention.<br>
<br>
Excuses are the guild killer. Personal accountability is the Archimonde killer.</div>

		<div id="post_message_610693">Our guild has been attempting Archimonde over the last few weeks with relatively little success (best attempt ~50%). We have adopted the 4-point strategy described at several points in this thread. We are finding that we can broadly put our wipes into three broad strategies:<br>
<br>
-personal stupidity (cratering/feared into doomfires/other reckless acts)<br>
-doomfires into melee<br>
-tank deaths when all the healers are in transit.<br>
<br>
We're working on the first. Dealing with the 2nd is proving a challenge, largely because the inflexibility of the fight and its chaotic nature makes it difficult to pin down exactly what is causing doomfires to run through Archimonde or around and into the melee. We've drilled into ranged groups that they must mouse turn and run radially away from Archimonde, yet melee still get hit on a regular basis. <br>
<br>
My questions are really these: is it the ranged that are doing something wrong, or is it that the melee need to be sharper to avoid incoming doomfires? Even with perfect ranged execution, should we expect some doomfires in the melee? Is it realistic to expect that the only time melee get hit with doomfire is when they are feared (which an appropriate Fear Ward rotation + tremor should solve)?</div>

		<div id="post_message_610700">There will be doomfires going for your melee no matter what you do. What we do is the groups call out when their doomfires turn early and is headig towards melee/another group so they can watch out and try to move away in time. Fear to doomfire on melee is going to happen too. Rogues can CoS it though and not all of the melee should be getting doomfire either so you can heal through it easily.<br>
<br>
Also when there is 5 secs left for fear I warn everyone of the incoming fear, if it takes time before it gets cast I keep repeating it, watch out for the fear. What people do is try to stay at least 25-30 yd away from all doomfires when the fear is coming. This greatly helps reduce the doomfire dmg on ranged if not completly on some groups.</div>

</div>It could be because ranged are looping/sidestepping - or it could be simply because the doomfire decided to go for melee. You really have to be in the actual fight watching to see how it happens, but its not necessarily anyones fault. No matter what strat you have, some doomfires will refuse to follow the people you want (the range groups) and instead might go towards melee.<br>

</div>The only two tools you need to deal with this effectively are"<br>
<br>
- Fear warded shaman in melee group, who knows what hes doing. (Yes, im aware its <i>possible</i> to do the fight without this, but realistically = youd be stupid to try, if your learning the fight)<br>
- Good communication on vent. Range groups should announce immediately when a doomfire appears to turn and head towards melee. Then they run off until its safe to return, if they are slow and die in the doomfire behind them (which was warned prior on vent), they messed up.</div>

</div>Here is a good way to pull:<br>
<br>
1) Have your entire raid get on their horse<br>
2) Have the MT run in first.<br>
3) MT runs mounted to his tank spot.<br>
4) MT uses bloodrage to break his mount when near the final position (for snap aggro off that stupid mage who firewarded and pulled aggro), uses an avoidance trinket, then uses demo/TC.<br>
<br>
This method is pretty much foolproof.  I'd highly recommend 4, the avoidance trinket is really helpful because you are unlikely to get many heals in the first 5-10 seconds.<br>
<br>
We also experimented with the stump strategy.  We found 4 corners to be easier and more repeatable.  <br>
<br>
We found the key to this fight is this: make sure each of your four corners runs out IMMEDIATELY and directly away from Archimonde at the first sign of doomfire.<br>
<br>
Tell them this before every pull: "You know how fast you have to move out of the flamestrike on Kael'thas?  That's not fast enough.  You cannot wait at all when running away from doomfire."<br>
<br>
Use a "crater" and "doomfire" list and make sure you use the language "blacklist".  People will start following your strategy.  If you are having stupid deaths, it's because people aren't being held accountable.<br>
<br>
1) Get recount<br>
2) scroll to "deaths"<br>
3) Select the fight where the player died early<br>
4) See the last 15 seconds-was it cratering?  Was there ANY doomfire damage in the last 15 seconds of their life?<br>
5) If 4 = yes, put them on a publicly posted list.<br>
6) If they crater twice or doomfire twice, sit them out.  If they do it two raids in a row, blacklist them until farm status.<br>
<br>
Worked for us like magic, and we didn't have to blacklist anyone.  No one was ever sat out.  The fear motivated people to follow orders and pay attention and we got him within 8 tries after hundreds of wipes.<br>
<br>
Yeah, we assume causality here, but it sure seemed like the list was the thing that worked for us.</div>

</div>Melee have plenty of tools to deal with doomfire on their own, whether it is breaking their own fear as a warrior, or cloaking it off as a rogue, therefore placing a shaman with fear ward as highest priority on the melee should be lower priority than you state.  Yeah it is nice to have a shaman with the melee, and we always do, but fear warding them shouldn't be a priority.  <br>
<br>
I find that it is much more important to break out people who can heal the quickest so we always have priests fearward the shaman they are grouped with, or themselves and then they dispel people.<br>
<br>
Obviously more than one strategy works, it is just my experience that the quicker we get the healers unfeared the smoother our runs go from every standpoint.</div>

		<div id="post_message_611371">We generally have 4-5 priests available (3 holy, 2 shadow), so setting up a FW rotation on two of the holy priests is the easiest thing for us to do.

The 4th one should be avoidable.<br>

Plebys, melee just have to be aware.  Doomfires will circle around to them.  They can generally avoid fears through totems/berserker rage.  Ranged should assist in letting them know, but the melee CANNOT rely on ranged to warn them.  Zoom out the camera with the macro posted, then look around.  You don't have to have the camera on your target to do DPS.<br>

</div>Our shamans were saying that it will definitely tick during the fear, but likely 3secs after the fear started, which might put you out of range, or not make it very useful. Might as well just drop tremor during the fight and keep it refreshed, and there's a chance it'll tick right after the fear.<br>
<br>
On our last kill we had 2 of our dps warriors die to doomfires at 60%, our hunter die in the first 10secs(grip+airburst away from the raid while running in and MDing tank), our tank got airbursted away from the raid and still managed to get a kill. 8-9 healers seem to help a lot for this fight to counter the mistakes, as long as archimonde isn't a bitch when it comes to his soul charges.</div>

</div>This is really a waste unless you are using a druid or paladin tank. The tank has pretty much nothing to do on this fight but build threat and use survival cooldowns/trinkets.

We made a few final tweaks last week and this week.  After having more or less successfully stressed the importance of not dying, we then stressed the importance of not getting the debuff in the first place, as it is a significant drain on healers attention.<br>
<br>
We also had almost all the healers play more aggressively.  If a healer's trinket is up, and they are not actively kiting a fire, they position themselves in range of the tank regardless of fires.  They have to react quickly if they get the Grip.  It is extremely common to have 3 groups our of range of the tank due to fires.  With another tank getting airburst, that leaves only 2 healers to heal the tank (and their own group).  Tying healers to groups just wasn't cutting it.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

- Good communication on vent. Range groups should announce immediately when a doomfire appears to turn and head towards melee. Then they run off until its safe to return, if they are slow and die in the doomfire behind them (which was warned prior on vent), they messed up.</div>

I'm not running down communication.  A timely "Melee watch out doomfire!" is always welcome.  But when the raid fails to announce, you can save yourself anyways, given a wide view portal and the presence of mind to avoid hyperfocusing on DPS.

</div>Archimonde can and will hit like a truck, especially during the fear phases, so you will want to have a tank capable of tanking Kael'thas (21k HP and up). And do your healers a favor and give them a buffer to react properly, even if some of them are feared.<br>
Note that I have only killed Archmonde three times yet, but with 3 different MTs. So, in my experience high stamina combined with an on-click avoidance trinket (for your average 'oh-shit' moments) works best. At least, it did for us.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>This indeed works with Vanish. Skilled players can do it, while not-so-skilled players are just too slow for it. I'm guessing it also works for Feign Death, since it has exactly the same effect as Vanish except with a different animation: entirely removing you from the Boss' threat list.<br>

</div>A possible side-effect of this is that over the course of the fight you will get more Fears instead. From experience Archimonde will not cast Fear if someone is affected by Airburst, which accounts for the long delays occasionally once his timer for casting it is up. <br>
<br>
Not a great difference admittedly, but a difference nonetheless and I'd count Fear as potentially a lot more dangerous than Airburst.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_617208"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->The idea about using Mass Dispel is a good one, but only really works if you go with a 4-corners (or 3-corners or some variant) strat.

<br>
I personally never "eat" a fear -- between WotF, Fear Ward, and my 2-minute pvp trinket, I break every single one. This means that I can play it a little more risky, stand a little closer to fires (and usually thus closer to the MT), help out with healing on every transition, and, most importantly, dispel. I get off 2-3 dispels per fear on average, usually on other healers who are around me, or people who are running straight toward fires.<br>

It can also be a game-saving performance if you happen to see someone with Doomfire on them start running under the effects of a fear. If you dispel them, they can then pot, healthstone, ice block, etc. to save themselves. If you let them run away from you while feared, then either you are taking responsibility for their healing (as a healer, that is), or you really don't care about the raid. <br>
<br>
It's not only priests who can remove fear, either -- it's dispellable by paladins as well, although ours don't tend to do it, instead leaving it to the priests and spamming heals on the MT.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Hello<br>
I have a question about Archimondes main tank gear. <br>
First, let me describe our situation. We've started MH/BT 3 weeks ago and so far we're at 4/5 MH and 4/9 BT. Obviously our next target is Archimonde. <br>
The thing is, we had really bad luck with drops and so far our MT is sporting the Supremus xbow and Teron pants as his only t6 loots. Is he able to tank Archimonde without the risk of being gibbed in ~2 seconds?<br>
Here's his armory: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080416031229/http://eu.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Kazzak&amp;n=tankeh" target="_blank">The World of Warcraft Armory</a></div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>He should be fine, we killed him when I was wearing similar gear.  <br>
 <br>
He needs to chainchug ironshields, keep up demo shout and thunderclap.  If you can tank Azgalor, you should be able to tank Archimonde, the damage is similar and you will have the similar healing interruption issues.  Your healers will need to communicate if they're out of range so he knows when to pre-emptively use his trinkets.<br>
 <br>
I'd also suggest swapping pepe's shroud for the phoenix wing cloak if he has one.  You don't need to worry as much about threat generation in this fight, so the +hit is an unnecessary luxury.<br>
 <br>
Armor and avoidance are as important as HP in this fight.  Don't sacrifice either of them for more stamina like you would with Kael.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I haven't heard anything about this yet so I thought I'd share:<br>
During tonight's attempt, I (rogue) happened to vanish while air burst was being cast on me and the result was more than pleasant.  Since Archimonde lost his target, he stopped casting it all together and went back to meleeing our MT.<br>
<br>
It's my theory that any ability that can drop a mob's target will stop Archimonde from airbursting that particular player and everyone in the aoe's range.  It *confirmed* works for Vanish.  Very possibly works for Feign Death as well.<br>
<br>
Hope it can prevent some deaths =).</div>

</div>This has been part of our melee strategy since our first night of attempts basically.  2 camps of people stand in melee range behind Archimonde - rogues and not rogues.  If they are paying attention your rogues will never get burst out of dps'ing, which can improve raid damage quite a bit.  Also warrior can intercept back to him after being burst but the timing on this seems to be tougher to execute.  All in all our only melee members that are normally burst and not dps'ing are the enchancement shaman.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Bolded for emphasis.  We got our first kill last night after ~140 total attempts.  Once the healers learned the basic survival skills, our biggest cause of tank death by far was dropped Tclaps and Demo Shouts (and tank death was the cause of roughly 1/3 of our wipes.)  <br>
<br>
The tank has a lot to deal with, so if you don't have a DPS warrior to help out with these, you might consider having one of the warlocks put up CoW to make your tank's life a little easier (and just eat the dps loss).<br>
<br>
EDIT:  And also, thanks to everyone who's posted in this thread.  The advice here helped us a lot in getting our kill.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

If I may, just after clarification on a few points: we currently have only 2 locks on our roster, so as far as curses go (keeping in mind we're still learning the encounter), and considering that we carry a maximum of 4 rogues, 1 critkitty and 1 enh shaman (and for arguments sake an average of 2 hunters); should we look at using CoRex and CoWeak in tandem, as opposed to the staple CoS / CoE?

For rogues; is priority #1 for CloS considered to be air burst, even when learning the fight, or should it be saved for Grips / Doomfires? From what I observed, while most of the doomfires were avoided by melee, there seemed to be 1-2 players per attempt getting the debuff. Something that never really occured to me would be the viability of having the rogues all stand on eachother, with the remaining warrior/shaman/druid out of range as far as air burst is concerned; that's definately something we'll work on for this weeks attempts.<br>

</div>Considering melee DPS is usually the bulk of the damage dealt to Archimonde, it would be wise to use Curse of Recklessness. We typically use Curse of Recklessness almost always, even if we only have one or two locks on any given boss encounter. Your second curse would depend on the number of fire/frost damage dealers versus shadow/arcane damage dealers. However, given the nature of the fight I think Shadows would be the superior choice since Warlocks and Shadow Priests can do damage on the run. I don't believe Curse of Weakness stacks with Demoralizing Shout, so I wouldn't ever bother using it. <br>
<br>
I'm not a rogue, but I imagine our rogues like to save CloS for "Oh crap!" moments. Personally I don't see the point in using it on air burst, it's not very difficult to use tears correctly. <br>
<br>
Hope that helps.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I have never tried cloaking Air Burst, as I would rather save it for Doomfire.  Decursers should always be on top of Grip and if you are running short on mages and druids bring along Purification Potions.  As far as vanishing Air BUrst goes, I've done it a few times (usually by accident as I'm paying more attention to melee positioning, tank proximity and Doomfire paths) and either everyone around me gets knocked away or he recasts it.  Sometimes he has recast it on me, other times its a new target.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>A feral druid is very good at mitigating damage, because archimonde can't crush. High dodge + high armor = low damage. The only problem is, that you have to use fear ward for your tank (or be very quick at dispelling) and not for your healers. If you use fear ward you will need every fear ward available (unless you go there with 6 priests) and not having them on your healers could be a problem if too many people have doomfire.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>While true, a prot war can keep thunderclap on by himself when melees have to move around, and can last stand or shield wall when shit hits the fan(which happens every now and then for various reasons, like people losing connection and getting air bursted). Considering the healing output on the tank can be really small at times, I'd rather bet on self fear breaks and emergency buttons than higher general mitigation. It's true for a lot of fights too sadly. They should get frenzied regeneration to scale, or have a talent that provides a shield wall type buff with it.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>See the comments above your post about CoW versus Demo.<br>
<br>
Regarding CoR: make sure your healers/MT are comfortable with the larger hits, you can end up with very few healers on the MT on this fight at times.<br>
<br>
Regarding CoE/CoS: Check the numbers after a decent attempt, but there's a good chance CoD will do more damage than CoS, especially as you're learning.  And I'm almost 100% certain CoD is better than CoE, because mages will be decursing in addition to all the running around.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>That damn stump.  It's impassible by Doomfire, and when we were first trying this encounter he was tanked nearby.  Invariably the melee would be overrun by Doomfire, as it would get stuck on the log and stump, and then eventually turn toward us while we were much closer.  Eventually we moved the tank spot about 50 feet closer to the Well and further from the Evil Stump, and that has made a very large difference in our melee viability on this fight.  We've also stuck a Paladin under Archimonde, and being affected by the melee's tremor totem; it gives a healer that is *always* in range, and has helped the melee survivability again.<br>

We're returning tonight and hope to be able to paint a nice Eredar silhouette on our kills board.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I use my pvp trinket and my battlemaster trinket. Actually, my battlemaster trinket is one of my base trinket now, I use it on every fight. As a resto druid that's often in a spriest group, the only stat that matters to me is +heal, and staying alive. The battlemaster provides one of the highest +heal in the game, and also helps with staying alive, so yea, I love it. I guess it might depend on the class, but for archimonde where staying alive is the most important thing, I'd say it's a good trinket, especially since the stats on the sides are not bad at all.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_626081"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->After our first week in Hyjal, and our first two nights on Archimonde, I've noticed a problem. For reference, we're using a 3-point system.<br>
<br>
<b>The problem:</b><br>
Our MT (a warrior) was getting hit like a ton of bricks. <br>
<br>
Her max hit for the night was 11281 even with blocking 676 of that. The average hit she would receive was approximately 7108 over the night. I am unsure of her exact BV, but it seems to be 676. She does have 2pc t5, as well as the Auto-Blocker. Her blocks ranged from a max of 806 to a minimum of 599. From parsing the logs, it seems that the 805/806 BV is while she gets the proc from 2pc t5. She <b>was</b> keeping shield block up, as only 20 out of 238 hits that landed were not blocked.<br>
<br>
Rough stats:<br>
AC: 19k<br>
HP: 22.5k<br>
Def: 497<br>
Dodge: 22%<br>
Parry: 15.88%<br>
Block%: 35.92%<br>
BV: 676?<br>
2pc t5<br>
<br>
Last night, we ran with 3 shaman (1 of each spec) and 4 priests.<br>
<br>
I went in there after the raid and did some solo "attempts" on Archimonde. During this time, the max he hit me for was 6999, with an average of 5871 and a low of 4836. I did approximately 2 repair bills' worth of "testing". Yes, I know this isn't perfect, but it was the best way I could come up with to figure out how hard he would hit me. This was also without consumables, without kings and without "raid buffs".<br>
<br>
I have approximately the following "raid buffed" stats:<br>
AC: 32k<br>
HP: 22.5k<br>
Def: 401<br>
Dodge: 50-54% (58-60 with GoA)<br>
Resil: 26<br>
<br>
<b>The Question</b><br>
With the group we have (3 shaman and 4 priests) is it worth the difference in overall mitigation to give up stance dancing?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_626099"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->If your only problem at Archimonde is the tank dying, then I would say go ahead and give it a try - but you have to remember if you're devoting so much Fear dispel to the Archimonde tank, then it's possible that those healers/dispellers may have difficulty with the added responsibility on top of getting other people up.<br>
<br>
If you're not dispelled out quickly, then there's extra additional risks you take - whether that's being feared into a nearby Doomfire, being feared into a very bad position that everyone has to react to, etc.<br>
<br>
Alternatively, your guild should make a ton of Ironshields and give it to your tank.  Like most consumables, their effect seems somewhat mediocre, but you should remember that the additional mitigation added to every single hit every time adds up phenomenally over the course of the encounter.<br>
<br>
What I don't understand is why your tank is using the Auto-Blocker for mitigation.  There's the Ancient Aqir Artifact, the Scarab of Displacement, the Lucky Pocket Watch, or any other trinkets with good defense and a great on-use ability that'll save your butt.  The Auto-Blocker is more of a threat trinket.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_626115"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I'm not sure I'd recommend using a Druid on the fight, but you never know - perhaps it would work for you guys. I find the most dangerous part of the fight is the fear (after you have dispelling and random doomfire/pancake deaths eliminated).<br>
It's when all the healers get interrupted and your tank is potentially taking some significant damage. You really want your tank not being feared into a doomfire at this point - and able to take proactive measures to stay alive if required (trinkets, nightmare seed or whatever).<br>
<br>
Anyway, I think the main issue is your warrior tank is taking significantly more damage per hit that I would expect - even for a warrior. Perhaps get your warrior to come over here and link her armory that she uses for the fight so we can critique it and offer suggestions? Also, a WWS link would be helpful to see what's going on.<br>
<br>
For reference, here's my WWS for our last archimonde:<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080416031234/http://wowwebstats.com/jxuycqyt1ujg5?s=25-402&amp;a=5" target="_blank">Silverstreak - WWS</a><br>
Avg: 6474, max: 8717<br>
<br>
If she's taking 11.8k swings something is very wrong.<br>
Firstly, make sure she's using a good fear break macro, and that she has the double-click protection thing *unchecked* in her interface options settings. A hit that big could mean she's getting hit in zerk stance.<br>
<br>
Make sure she is using Ironshields - particularly if she isn't optimally geared for the fight. My gear is quite decent and I still use them - it helps much more than you'd expect.<br>
And her avoidance seems low. It might seem a little counterintuitive but dropping a little hp / block value for strong avoidance trinkets and armor gear is very effective on this fight. I'd definitely use the shadowmoon trink or moroes or scarab instead of the blocker.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_626124"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Getting feared on this fight isn't the end of the world--it's pretty easy to recover from these days. Still, it's hardly ideal, and just tickling the dragon's tail, especially when that fear ward can be used to keep others alive via FWing people with a well-timed mass dispell or a tremor totem. (Disclosure: our problem was people being dumb with doomfire, not tank deaths so much.) Archimonde is such a flaky fight, minimizing instances of 'doing things weird' will help in the long run when you come back, I would think.<br>
<br>
It sounds as if you have an issue with your tank's knowledge about how they should be gearing for this fight more than anything. Fixing that might make a better switch in long term repeatability than just switching to a druid tank, even though it seems like it is very possible to use one.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_626342"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Most importantly, those hits aren't even possible unless you let debuffs fall and you're getting hit in berserker stance, which should never happen.  Demo shout(talented) and thunderclap(talented) should both have 100% uptime on this fight, no excuses.  If your main tank doesn't have the talents, have one of your other warriors spec into it and bring him.  Even if its a prot warrior, we've always brought 2 prot warriors to this fight ever since we've done it.  The debuffs on the boss are very important and from what you described (avg hit of 7100) and your tank dying fast, these debuffs probably weren't up very often.  <br>
<br>
Block value is a terrible stat for this fight.  For starters, the boss can't crush, so shield block isn't even that big a deal.  That doesn't mean you shouldn't use it at all, but its not a huge priority, as the damage reduction is really really small.  It's even worse because this is a hard hitting, slow attacking mob.  The slower a mob attacks and the harder he hits, the worse block value is for mitigation.  There is absolutely no reason to wear enough block to be blocking for 600-800 on this fight, and especially not an autoblocker.   I don't know what your main tanks gear is like but I would definitely recommend going max avoidance on this fight (as long as you don't drop below 21kish hp.)  Threat shouldn't be an issue at all on this fight, even in max avoidance gear.<br>
<br>
Also ironshields.  Use them.  I have every single piece of gear in this game I could possibly want and I still use them for this fight.  You should always use them, especially if you're undergeared (which it sounds like your tank is.)<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
Getting hit in Zerker stance makes sense as for why she would get hit for more than half her HP. I'm going to be looking into that.<br>
<br>
White, I wish we had the gear choices you have, but again this is only our first week in Hyjal, and we haven't even spent any significant time in BT except our late-night trash farming. Another thing that is somewhat frustrating is that our old MT left us while we were fighting Kael. He had gear preference, so he basically had anything he ever wanted, and it walked out the door with him.<br>
<br>
Our current MT has had quite a bit of stepping up to do, and to be honest she has done quite well. The reason I ask about me tanking the boss is that when you see numbers like 11k popping up on a boss that can't crush, well, you get a little freaked out.<br>
<br>
Another reason that this idea crossed my mind was because I tanked Azgalor due to higher physical mitigation / avoidance. I started seeing a lot of parallels, and the fear is the only possible dealbreaker. <br>
<br>
I do have a 2m PvP trinket, so I figured that could be something to fall back on, as well as with grace of air + an active pocket watch, I can get my dodge up to ~75%.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_626487"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Demo shout dropping + CoR might give a rather high hit too, but yea, while archi hits quite hard, the tank dieing is usually the least of your worries once you have a few tries in and know how to deal with the pull. Most of the time when our tank dies it's cause of a soulcharge, mainly the silence one, or the stun one(well the one that makes you fall, I guess it interupts healing, I'm a druid so don't know really). <br>
<br>
While bears mitigate more, if a fear ward fucks up and he starts running the wrong way(depending on your strat there might be no wrong way, but in ours he can run from all the healers), or if he gets doomfire just before a fear so the healing will be lower, last stand, shield wall and healing pot+healthstone do help. They should make barskin castable in bearform imo, and make frenzied regen scale with total hp, but that's another story.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
Most important to having a lowgeared tank was for us, having great healers on that tank. <br>
Give the tank all the group buffs you can. Improved imp, Improved Devotion aura, Shaman with Agi totem. Anything you can give him. <br>
With this it should be ok-ish.<br>
Give him a few stacks of ironshield potions, and a healthy supply of nightmare seeds. Pop either when a lot of people take damage, to reduce the weight on your healers. <br>
<br>
But we werent wiping due to tank death, we were wiping due to people being stupid enough to keep getting doomfires (plus the occasional falling death). Getting people to not take too much damage, made us survive and kill him.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_630295"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->A big thanks to everyone thats posted in this thread; got him down on our fourth night of attempts (around 70-80 attempts before a kill).<br>
<br>
Structure was: Prot tank, 10 healers, 14 dps (minus the 3 mages on decurse bitch duties). 5 tremor totems really helped a lot, and rebalancing from 9 to 10 healers for last night's raid really seemed to make it just that little bit more manageable when compared to our previous raids. Survived through one death, as of our pallies proved that he fails at falling, having cratered at about 60%.<br>
<br>
Tank group included GoA; which i'm fairly sure we hadn't utilised until last night, having been short on shamans until then. Strat used was four-point, with some input from healers being more comfortable on the west side of Archimonde (ie behind our tank), so a few more healers were stacked on that side, compared to the east. Doomfire avoidance and trinket use perhaps still need some work, but i'm happy enough to say that we earned the kill, and in a reasonably short learning time.<br>
<br>
Thanks again for all the info here, it's been a huge help.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>We used a part of the mountaineer strategy last week and got a flawless firstkill from it. Last night we managed our second Archimonde kill in our 2nd try.<br>
<br>
Here's what we did:<br>
<br>
Have all healers and ranged dps stand on the mountains divided into three groups with decursers and tremor totems in each of them. The MT stands pretty close to the mountains and is in heal range of all mountain healers.<br>
<br>
Melee DPS plus two more healers and one decurser stand in the open field behind archimonde. Melee DPS are partly in range of the mountain healers and if they got doomfired and run away are being healed by the infield healers. <br>
<br>
As we have a lot of healing that doesn't need to move and therefore can deliver a lot of healing we can play quite aggressively and have MT and melee dps take a lot of fire.<br>
<br>
We take on Mount Hyjal with 7-8 healers and have protection paladins and feral druids wear their healing gear for Archimonde. So we have about 10 healing chars for this fight which is quite comfortable.<br>

		<div id="post_message_631113"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I'm going to go out on a limb and say that the mountaneering strategy for archimonde is perhaps the cleanest solution I've seen put forth to the fight.<br>
<br>
I've done the fight in the currently accepted manner, and not in the mountaineering method.  That said - the mountaineering method looks like it has a harder pull, a harder dps requirement and trades doomfire fuckery for airburst fuckery which I view as about neutral.  It also seems far more repeatable, still requires you not to be terribad, and is more forgiving of odd compositions.  (Think decurser/tremor counts)<br>
<br>
I'd say that this is a better fight than "everyone run around and dodge fire" simply because I think it's more elegant.  It adapts easily to partial compositions, and it reminds me of (for instance) firemaw.  As far as I can tell you're still going to have some people down in the fire unless you really think a 12 person airburst is ok.<br>
<br>
I doubt it's what blizzard envisioned, but I wouldn't call it fully exploitastic.  As far as I can tell you're trading 10 dps/healers running around and associated doomfire related shenanigans for tank standing in doomfire and noticably harder to handle airbursts (5+ hits on airburst are basicly guaranteed compared to SC's usual 1-2).<br>
<br>
I'm reserving judgement until I have a chance to run into hyjal and look at the hills to think about it, but at first glance it doesn't look like out and out ridiculousness to me.<br>
<br>
Edit to add: Upon further examination this looks identical to deciding to tank prince malch against a wall and stand against a wall to minimize the impact of infernals.  There's at least one point where the doomfire comes up the hill towards one of the camps where a fear would put them into the fire so it's clearly possible but unlikely to hit that area.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_631241"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I tank prince malch on the wall because it removes half of the available 30 yard circle around our tank/melee from being a valid target for infernals as well.  You might not realize this is happening, but I promise you are much less likely to be infernal hit at the edge of that area than the center.<br>
<br>
Mitigating the infernals by hugging the walls is acceptable, I'm unclear on why mitigating doomfire in a similiar way wouldn't be.  Please note I haven't had the chance to go home and look at the hills, but I have looked at the video and mentioned some of the added difficulty factors I identified with this method.  I'm reserving judgement until I actually verify that the hills are pathable for archimonde and co.<br>
<br>
This isn't free loot mode as far as I can tell from the video.  5+ person airbursts are fairly disruptive.  Doomfire always on the tank is fairly strenuous healing.  It looks like you trade some doomfire running for more flying, and potentially more dangerous routes back to the boss.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
At any rate, the "mountaineer" strat isn't akin to putting yourself on a wall on the Malch balcony, this is more like positioning your ranged on some magical floating platform outside his balcony where an infernal could never possibly land. It's definitely not "free loot mode"; you're taking huge Air Bursts (what is the range on this anyway? 13 yards?), but removing Doomfire from ranged priority allows you to play so much more offensively it seems comical. Honestly, I'd expect a hotfix for Archimonde to start DTing people who climb the mountains if more people started to do this.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_631304"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->It really depends on how the doomfire/archimonde themselves path in relation to the wall.  There's some indication that the doomfire can come up there - presumably it's just less likely to actually path in a straight line for that long and if it does it will be near the end of it's pathing instead of the beginning because it follows the dips and curves to get to them.  (See the video, there's a portion where the recorder checks the doomfire to his left and adjusts away - there's some fear breaks used to avoid running into it)<br>
<br>
If it cannot get to them at all, then I'd imagine they'd change it.  If instead they found a position where the pathing on doomfire makes it take longer to get to them than if they'd been on flat terrain, I imagine nothing will change.  There's not some magical rule that requires you to tank lucifron in the lava in mc, or stand in an infernal on prince malch.  Assuming the mob and his associated spawns can actually path into the hills, fighting him there is fine.  If the mob cannot path up to them, then yes that's exploitation.<br>
<br>
As I mentioned - I'm going to go run around in hyjal before I make up my mind on which this feels like.  I think it's more on the side of "better encounter strategy" than "lol we found a pixel in heigans room" but I could be wrong.<br>
<br>
Edit:<br>
<br>
Doomfire will quite happily burn up the hill.  Admittedly it takes longer to reach you (because it travels the long diagonal along the ground instead of the short side of the triangle from your position to his forehead) but that seems neatly balanced by additional grip/burst difficulty.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_635391"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Normally I wouldnt post on places like this (my typing is rly shit ask my guildies).<br>
<br>
Anyway weve been pulling Archimonde for 2.5 nites about 8hours total, best percent was 51%. We cant seem to stop the random fear/doomfire/airburst combos  for the most part curses have not been an issue. We have been using the 4 corner strat, (decurse heal dps in mini grps traveling together reverting back to original spot when cleared)<br>
<br>
I was trolling this forum and caught the mountainer strat, and this got me personally conflicted for a bit, so i brought it to the attention of some of my guildies and we were all torn, some say not an exploit some said it was so we talked to a GM<br>
<br>
A dude in my guild talked with a GM and they couldn't get into deep specifics because it could be construed as giving boss advice to a guild, and they are not allowed to discuss strats.  However, after talking with him, standing on the hills is NOT considered an exploit so long as the following criteria is met:<br>
<br>
A)  Everyone is able to hit by an Airburst (not an issue w/ this strat)<br>
B)  Those that are dps'ing the boss or healing the tank are in range of fears. (again, not an issue w/ this strat)<br>
C)  Anyone standing on the hill is CAPABLE of being hit by the fires.  So long as they are able to path up the hill, it is "not an exploit, it is a use of terrain to ease the mechanics of the fight."   to quote the GM<br>
<br>
<br>
So we did some testing took a cpl heals our main tank some rouges and a lonely lock into archimonde had the dps strip we healed the tank for as long as possible with a few ppl in each camp spot.<br>
<br>
This is wut we found outta 6-7 pulls fires pathed direclty to 1 camp once and 1 pathed next to a camp.<br>
So this Proves that fire can path into the mountains its just a variable u hope doesnt heappen much like tanking the first real boss in mech on the corner of the stairs<br>
<br>
Now personally i like the dude who said he used melee in the middle to help ctrl the fires. I plan to try to utilize this with 2-3 bad ass melee and bad ass decurser and healer prob an extra drood if i have one around.<br>
<br>
So id say mountaineer is not an exploit but it wouldnt surprise me if someday guilds who got use to this method went in for there wkly farm and find that the terain has been changed. I plan on ninjaing a kill this way since it is NOT AN EXPLOIT according to the 3 standards we were given, and still wiping to get the normal way still<br>
<br>
*edit we used this strat with a melee grp infield playing with fires, with 1 decurse and 1 heal out there 2, and we 1 shoted on him that nite, gr8 addition to the strat market think everyone hsould do i tthis way itll save sooo much time and does mae him truely ez lewt<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Back on the topic of the 4-corner strat:<br>
<br>
we have a pretty well-geared tank, but we're seeing some pretty crazy random events which end up causing him to die.  On one pull last night, he was immediately hit for 8000, then about 1.5 seconds later 9000, then finished 1.5 seconds after that with another 9000 -- before the healers could get a shot off.  Even if they had NS healed and gotten the lucky wipe-saving crit, they would have pulled aggro.<br>
<br>
We're also seeing the tank die to doomfire + grip + big hits + healer-fear + healers-running-from-doomfire + healers-being-airbursted.  That combo happened all within 5-6 seconds of each other several times last night.<br>
<br>
On the last pull of the night, two doomfires converged on one rogue in melee range who had just blown cloak to get doomfire + grip off him just before he got airbursted into another doomfire (where he blew the FR pot).  He took 9000 damage in 2 seconds.<br>
<br>
We're all pretty well geared and fairly clued in at this point -- occasional craters due to lag spikes or disconnects notwithstanding -- but this fight is testing our patience with being random like Prince squared.  Good looking pulls and clean rips down to 60%, then suddenly some crazy situation ensues where survivability is almost impossible.<br>
<br>
Seeing that problem, we started calling the healers in to try and stay close even when their group ran from the doomfire to try to kite it, so there'd always be healing near the MT and melee group.  The result appeared to be that doomfire curled in more, attracted to the scent of healers perhaps.<br>

</div>You're intentionally making the fight more random by assigning 4 corners.  I suspect you tank prince malch against the wall, with all of your casters/healers spread haphazardly around the room?  3 corners is less random than 4.  Tanking him where your players can stand uphill (to artificially lengthen the path doomfire takes to them) is less random. You can choose to emphasize airbursts or doomfire as the "more difficult" in your strategy.  If you're wiping to doomfire all the time, consider changing to "airburst hurts more".<br>
<br>
This fight looks and feels dramaticly repeatable to me.  I don't think there's been a single death I haven't been able to identify as "this player made a bad decision", and I know there has been no point at which I felt "this is a luck based encounter".  For reference SC's kills to date have involved fighting him in the field, running away from doomfire, and not accepting excuses about "why player x died to factors outside his control".  The sooner you start telling your raid "the only person who has an unavoidable death excuse is the MT, and then only if he burned his cooldowns and was blocking" the faster your raid will improve.<br>
<br>
You can consistently keep total doomfire damage to the raid below 100k even when you're running around in the field.  You can also just brute force doomfire via more healers.  There's several different ways to handle it, depending on your raid's gear/etc you'll need to find what works best for you.<br>
<br>
Saying "it's random and we get unlucky" shows a profound unwillingness to understand the mechanics involved.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Even with what Anias is saying it still takes a lot of practice and attempts for Archimonde to become a smooth kill.  Think my guild took around 60 attempts for the first kill, 35 attempts for the 2nd kill, 10ish attempts for the 3rd kill with the 4th and now 5th have basically been one shots.  This seems to be the norm at least for most guilds from what I can tell.  <br>
<br>
I think on our 3rd kill I had made up my mind this was the worst encounter of my WOW career but after one shots on back to back weeks I've been a bit less critical.  Though if we ever get an influx of new players I'm sure there will be pain if we are still doing Archi.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_635550"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->The fight is "big" so it's not immediately obvious to everyone in the raid on the first pull exactly what they need to do.  Guilds that communicate when they screw up and emphasize how they made those mistakes so that the group learns from someone else's mistake are going to do better here than groups that require everyone to see it themselves.  That said, it's not particularly random.  Unforgiving of poor judgement, certainly, but the randomization is essentially limitted to who gets air bursted, and the cooldown on that is long enough that it shouldn't make a huge difference.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_635959"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->To toss another anecdote into the pot:<br>
<br>
We've killed him twice now. We use three groups (south, northeast, and northwest) with 3 healers per group (one of whom is usually a feral/shadowpriest/DPS shaman in healing gear) and at least one decurser per group (usually 2 in the south group to cover for the possibility of a decurser getting burst into the well). We put a holydin in the melee group and the enhancement shaman in that group gets fearwarded. The holydin in the center dispels any melee not in the main melee group and provides constant healing on the tank. All three "corner" groups dodge doomfires and keep the MT alive (with the north groups doing most of the MT-healing and the south groups doing most of the melee healing). Corner groups must call out on vent whenever they see a doomfire loop back towards the melee.<br>
<br>
As has been mentioned over and over, prioritize survival over everything. We go in with 10 healers (but usually 6-7 melee DPS) and the enrage has never been an issue.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

To answer all your questions - practice <br>
<br>
We actually abandonded the 4 corner strat in the end - improvement rate was just too slow. We have all the raid in a 180 deg arc behind him and two main healers (Priest/Pali) in the area behind the MT.<br>
The melee group sit behind him with a Resto Druid and Shaman there too. Resto stacks HoTs on MT and dispels Grip, Shaman acts as totem/chain heal bitch.<br>
<br>
By putting your two best healers out on their own in that area you can more or less guarantee heals on your MT - an Undead Priest should never get feared into a doomfire, and if he has to kite one away or gets airbursted, the Pali is on hand to heal the MT.<br>
<br>
As mentioned so many times in this thread - it's all about survival. <br>
<br>
(1) If anyone dies to Doomfire it is <u>THEIR</u> fault. It's not unlucky, it's not a healer's fault for not healing them. <u>Their fault</u>. <br>
(2) If your trinket/racial is on cooldown and a Fear is incoming, get the heck away from fire trails.<br>
(3) If a fire is chasing you, DONT sidestep it, keep running in a direct line away from Archimonde until it cannot possibly turn back and enter the raid again.<br>
<br>
Once we drilled these rules into the raid Archimonde went down in 3 tries, the first of which was due to us missing enrage timer by 30secs, the second by 10secs. It's far better to train your raid to survive the full distance than for people to die trying to do too much dps. DPS will improve rapidly as you get better at the fight, but people not dying tends to improve only slowly by comparison.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>As far as your tank deaths due to lack of healing for whatever reasons, there are a couple of things that can help. First, having a tree druid in the tank group is huge because his HoTs can be solely responsible for keeping a tank up while healers are running from doomfire/being airbursted. Also, your healers that are MT healing need to communicate so when something happens and they can't heal the tank for whatever reason either a paladin can bubble and eat a doomfire to keep healing him or one of the healers in a DPS group that isn't doomfired can toss the tank some heals. <br>
<br>
Also, we have a healer/decurser (our feral OT in healing gear) that stands with the melee to make sure there is always at least one healer/decurser in range of the melee/MT. He used to respec when we were learning the fight, but now he just throws on healing gear and it works fine. A general tip is we have one of the melee with the maxcameradistance command (I can't remember exactly what it is) that watches doomfires and calls out whenever one turns and has even a chance at reaching the melee since doomfires raping the whole melee group is what would wipe us most times when we were still learning it.<br>
<br>
For the severe burst damage on pull problems, our resto druid usually gets full HoTs rolling and is OK threat wise as long as the tank is getting a MD. <br>
<br>
<br>
It may seem like the fight will always be random and easy to wipe to, but really once you get it down its not that bad at all because A) he will be dying faster due to better gear/familiarity with the fight and B) even with the random unavoidable death due to someone D/Cing or whatever you will be able to heal through the soul charge most times because the rest of the fight is going a lot smoother than when you are first learning it. We have only wiped to it once in the past month, and our first Archi kill was in late december.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

- We tanked him in the middle - about 30 yards away from where he was<br>
- MT has capped hit and is 0.5% off capped expertise<br>
- MT used ironshield pots on cooldown on all good attempts as well as nightmare seeds<br>

<b>Melee Observations</b><br>
As you can see from above we are very very melee and physical dps heavy. We used COR on this boss and negated it with improved demo shout<br>
- In ALL our attempts we noticed that melee got doomfired only once and that too when they were out of melee range due to a fear<br>
- MT got doomfired once, he didn't move and was healed through it<br>
- All rogues were undead and they did a WOTF followed by CLOS if they were going into doomfire<br>
- All warriors broke fear as required<br>
- No melee used the pvp trinket except for the feral druid<br>
<br>
<b>Positioning</b><br>
- 3 Healers at 12 o clock (behind MT): Shaman/Paladin/Druid (assigned to decursing MT &amp; melee group)<br>
- 1 Ranged group with shaman and decurser @ 4 o clock<br>
- 1 Healing group with shaman and decurser @ 8 o clock<br>
- 2 melee groups behind boss with a shaman in each<br>
<br>
<b>Healing</b><br>
- We asked the druids to keep HOTs on MT, HOT uptime was @ 80%<br>
- We didn't really need a fear break rotation due to a shaman in every single group and HOTs on MT. The paladin did confirm that he needed to break fear with trinket or bubble a few times to emergency heal the MT.<br>
<br>
<b>Decursing</b><br>
- No curse was up for more than 1 or 2 ticks<br>
- The mage as well as the druids were assigned groups to decurse, positions had been assigned previously<br>
- The whole raid had purification potions in case they were out of decurse range after an airburst range, yet only 2 purification pots were used<br>
<br>
<b>The Shaman OP WIN</b><br>
- The fear break totem was dropped right at the warning for all melee groups including MT group, this in combination with the PVP trinket and orders to move 30 yards away from doomfires at all times caused only 1 death from doomfire<br>
- We assigned 1 shaman to solely heal MT to keep the armor buff on him<br>
<br>
<b>Air Burst</b><br>
- Everyone was asked to practice falling off a cliff with the tears of the goddess<br>
- No one died due to an air burst<br>
<br>
<b>DPS Charts</b><br>
- DPS charts were banned during this fight, we believe its purely a survival fight and don't care much for DPS <br>
<br>
<b>The Pull</b><br>
- The survival Hunter does a trinketed misdirect to MT who goes in with shield block up and full hots<br>
- 3 healers are in range of MT already and ready to heal if required<br>
- Melee cuts a HUGE arc and joins the battle 15 seconds later from behind the boss<br>
<br>
<b>Doomfire Management</b><br>
- ONLY the person who gets doomfire trailing to him runs directly away from archimonde<br>
- All other people strafe to 25-30 yards to ensure that tehy stay in healing/dps/decurse range<br>
- Under no circumstances should anyone circle or strafe if they have a doomfire following them<br>
- I play rogue myself, and I noticed that I could postion myself away from trails so that I would never get feared into them - all other melee followed suite and in the last 10 or so attempts on him NO MELEE DIED to doomfire<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>The Bounty Method</b><br>
The biggest issue for us in this fight was survival. Hence we came up with the bounty method<br>
- First to die due to any reason except a decurse paid a fine of 20g (members), 30g (officers), 50g (guild leaders)<br>
- Bounty was at 370g before we got him down, this was distributed equally to the whole raid after the kill shot<br>
- We told people to turn back and run like madmen if the saw a doomfire coming to them, this ensured that there weren't trails of fire to mess up the healers and ranged. People who did not follow this method were asked to pay the 20g fine<br>
- Getting the MT airbursted caused us to wipe 3 times and we made the guilty party pay the fine for the bounty<br>
We came to the conclusion that this bounty caused people to concentrate 100% during the fight and not come up with excuses like "No one healed me" or "my pot was on CD" - we run recount so we had them take an SS if they died due to a curse and teh decurser was in range.<br>
<br>
After 4-5 fines the raid started getting extremely focused and people stopped dying because they understood that survival &gt; charts<br>
<br>
<br>
I am not sure but I think that this is one of the few times that such a melee heavy guild has downed this boss in 2 days of practice. I do believe that so few doomfires on melee in all our attempts is a significant mechanic and should be noted (as it is contrary to the belief of having a lot of ranged dps).<br>
<br>
I would be glad to answer any questions anyone may have on this kill, obviously we are about 6 months late on killing him but its with a melee heavy group with shaman power so I do believe its different.<br>

Tank HP will be arond 20k anyway, no use stacking pure stamina items like a dark moon or netherwing trinket. and have at least one shaman or priest heal your MT, the armor bonus on their crit heals is awesome for the non-crushing big-hitters in T6 content.

				<div style="font-style:italic">This fight looks and feels dramaticly repeatable to me.  I don't think there's been a single death I haven't been able to identify as "this player made a bad decision", and I know there has been no point at which I felt "this is a luck based encounter". <br>

</div>Yeah, getting this across is really paramount. I think that aside from very rare, very badly timed connection issues, I was always able to identify some play or preparation error that led to my death. It might not be quite the same for healers using their trinkets and other cooldowns proactively to save others, but as dps, if i died, i did something wrong at some point during the fight. It was not necessarily in the moments right before the death though. I suspect that's where a lot of people trick themselves. <br>
<br>
"My x was on cooldown and i got feared into doomfire" well why did you get that close to a doomfire without a panic button, and what forced you to use it earlier?<br>
<br>
"I was trapped in by doomfires" They didn't all spawn at once. Why were close enough to the first one that you couldn't get to the other side of the second close one when it spawned instead of being sandwiched in?<br>
<br>
"I got cursed and i was cut off from the decursers by fire/airburst" Did you try using a purification pot? Why weren't you standing on your decurser? etc.<br>
<br>
Try to be firm with people that die, but avoid being antagonistic, and do not to humiliate them in public. It's really easy for the encounter to make you feel like you're fighting your other members instead of the boss if you let it. Almost everyone in your raid is going to wipe you on arch sooner or later. As long as they're not repeating the same mistakes or copping out by claiming "randomness" you should get there.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
Back on the topic of the 4-corner strat:<br>
<br>
we have a pretty well-geared tank, but we're seeing some pretty crazy random events which end up causing him to die.  On one pull last night, he was immediately hit for 8000, then about 1.5 seconds later 9000, then finished 1.5 seconds after that with another 9000 -- before the healers could get a shot off.  Even if they had NS healed and gotten the lucky wipe-saving crit, they would have pulled aggro.<br>
<br>
We're also seeing the tank die to doomfire + grip + big hits + healer-fear + healers-running-from-doomfire + healers-being-airbursted.  That combo happened all within 5-6 seconds of each other several times last night.<br>
<br>
On the last pull of the night, two doomfires converged on one rogue in melee range who had just blown cloak to get doomfire + grip off him just before he got airbursted into another doomfire (where he blew the FR pot).  He took 9000 damage in 2 seconds.<br>
<br>
We're all pretty well geared and fairly clued in at this point -- occasional craters due to lag spikes or disconnects notwithstanding -- but this fight is testing our patience with being random like Prince squared.  Good looking pulls and clean rips down to 60%, then suddenly some crazy situation ensues where survivability is almost impossible.<br>
<br>
Seeing that problem, we started calling the healers in to try and stay close even when their group ran from the doomfire to try to kite it, so there'd always be healing near the MT and melee group.  The result appeared to be that doomfire curled in more, attracted to the scent of healers perhaps.<br>
<br>
Can someone confirm my suspicion, which is that even with perfectly executed 4 corner strat, this fight can be double digit wipe territory even in 'farm status'?</div>

</div>What you said about the tank dying on the pull sounds.. completely normal, that's just what happens if the tank doesn't avoid anything and your healers aren't casting. Try getting priests/shamans to spam the tank with r1 heals to proc their +armour buffs before the pull, and get him to chain Ironshield pots, they make a huge difference. Grip should never tick on the tank (or really, anyone) since it should be decursed so fast. Have your healers make a rotation to break fear and keep healing the tank, etc. There are a lot of <i>random</i> things that can happen in any given fight, but a kill doesn't require <i>luck</i>. It's all about foresight and control. Healers are running from doomfire while others are getting feared and airbursted? Have your healers move well away from doomfire with plenty of time to spare before the fear. Have them spread so only one can get airbursted at a time. Communicate with your tank so he can blow a cooldown, etc.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>My guild has been killing Archimonde for around 3 months now and we can still go through a fair number of wipes and we employ the 4 corner strategy. Honestly though as has been pointed out countless times in this thread, deaths in this fight amount to lack of focus on the part of the raid member who dies. The difficulty with this fight after multiple goes is that the people who were focused to start, become frustrated and then all of a sudden their unfocused play becomes the source of the problem as the previously poor playing raid members start to step up their level of concentration. <br>
<br>
Basically methods like the bounty method discussed above or pretty much anything you can do to focus your raid before you start attempts whether it be incentive or punishment is a good thing. Having everyone completely tuned to what you're about to do is the biggest advantage you can take with you going into this fight. Lack of focus from any given member can be a huge problem, even when you've seen and completed the encounter numerous times.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_654628"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->We just tell people to spread out evenly, and only assign set positions for decursers and areas for healers to heal using the clock(f.ex healer x you keep the guys at 8 o'clock alive). The benefit of this is that it teaches your guild how to be more aware of their surroundings, and you avoid having wipes due to "well that wasn't my job/position last time". You also don't have to explain people new to the fight/guild your tactic in detail, and in general spend a lot less time explaining tactics.

</div>You pretty much get lucky I guess.<br>
<br>
Short of everyone running away on a slightly different vector there is no other way to tell who the fire is following.  I think what he's saying is that people should be aware and notice that after a moment of running that if the fire isn't on them to turn around and stop running.

		<div id="post_message_655221"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Unless you're a healer, you just run away if you remotely suspect that the doomfire is after you. The job of the ranged DPS in this fight is to kite fires away, so it's really not an issue if 3 people head for the hills instead of just one. (Depending on whether MT-survival is proving an issue you may need to have your healers be more aggressive about dodging fires and staying close - when their trinket is up or when the fear is on CD - but ranged DPS should never risk causing a fire to loop.)<br>
<br>
Doomfires are unpredictable and cannot be 100% controlled. They are more likely to follow people running in front of them than to wander off randomly however, so attempting to lead them away reduces the problems in melee range.

		<div id="post_message_655408"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Here's some more specific information on the Doomfire as requested above.<br>
<br>
The people are spread out in 3 pockets around Archimonde. Whenever the doomfire starts making a trail towards one of the pockets, people strafe randomly a bit and pick up who its following. That guy then turns and runs from archimonde like a madman.<br>
<br>
If they make a mistake and trail it across they pay a fine to add to the bounty.<br>
<br>
In my opinion having all 25 people concentrate is the only way to win this fight - we did it with a punishment (fine if u mess up) reward (split the fines amongst the raid when you down him) method.<br>
<br>
If any one of your ranged trails the doomfire across the raid - its pretty much over since u'll cut off the raid into different groups making fear avoidance, healing, decursing impossible.<br>
<br>
To add to the above new posts (made while I was writing this) I would like to say that we get mad at people who are even remotely within 20-30 yards of the doomfire trail.<br>

		<div id="post_message_656977"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->As my guild is progressing into Hyjal at the moment, I thought I would ask those of you who are more experienced as to what seems like a more solid plan for Archimonde: (I like to think ahead a lot.)<br>
<br>
1.) Fear ward the MT. Fear ward a resto shaman in a healer group to make sure he's able to drop a tremor totem to keep the healers on the MT.<br>
<br>
2.) Fear ward the MT. No fear ward on the shaman and bring extras and spread them around along with healers into seperate groups with tremor down constantly to hopefully have healers brought back into the fray quicker (Assuming there will be some stagger in terms of the tremor pulses of the multiple shaman).<br>
<br>
Keeping fear ward on 2 targets at all times max seems feasible since we typically have 5+ priests in the raid; holy and shadow. I'm including shadow since especially next patch having them fear ward targets is a given.<br>
<br>
I thought I would ask if there was any merit to using one over the other. As far as I can see the second seems more reliable due to the lack of "Oh god the shadow priest didn't FW in time" or somesuch. But the first option has the possibility of being able to deliver the most immediate and quantitative healing to the MT after a fear. This again is all based upon my impression from people here that Archimonde hits like a freight train and that no heals for a few seconds could well spark MT death. <br>
<br>
Don't get me started on doomfire yet, I'm gonna wait until I've actually seen it before I try to figure anything out. It seems like one of those "You'll never get it until you experience it" things. That said I've already started whipping people to get their 2 minute PVP trinket anyway.<br>
<br>
Edit: After pondering it for a moment after posting I realise the first option isn't feasible due to the need to spread people around archimonde in groups. Seems I found my own answer.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
Fearwarding a shaman or priest in a healer group would be another good choice, if MT death during fears is proving an issue.<br>
<br>
I would say it's a waste to fear ward the MT (unless you're using a bear of course). Your tank should be able to dance every fear, and it's not like this is a threat-sensitive fight (as in, it's about survival not DPS, so DPSers can simply hold back if they're running onto the MT's heels).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
Same for doomfires. If you think it may be coming your way, assume it is. It generally doesn't take more than a few seconds to tell if it's coming to you specifically or not, as people rarely run exactly in the same direction and you'll see if it's following you or not.<br>
<br>
Even for healers it seems like this fight isn't healing intensive enough for you not be able to allow yourself to move some when doomfires are anywhere near. Leave the risk to the people that have the termor totem to handle it (hopefully you have at least a healer group with it although healing can be fine even if you don't have a full healer group with termor). Getting hit by doomfire will take out a noticeable amount of a healer's attention anyway so the risk you took in order to heal a little more actually costed a lot of healing, assuming you actually live. Dead healers can't heal others, and healers healing doomfired people aren't healing the tank and/or airbursts...<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Split rnaged/healers in 3 groups in a square formation around Archimonde, MT in middle with melee behind. 1 have 1 dispeller in every ranged/healing group and tell them also decurse MT/Melee if needed, warn them decurse over nuking/healing (whatever their job is). If you have shammys have them drop grounding totem and your group be near enough to it, groups should stand near each other maybe try 2 people in a group stand on each other and 10 yards away have another 2 and the healer/dispeller stand behind them a few yards so only 2-3 people per group actually are bursted. Try not go into other groups unless maybe if the Air Burst sends them that way. <br>
<br>
The biggest problem with this fight is the doomfire, tell people to assume its going for them and turn around and run away, 180 degrees, do not left/right or it will break and possibly cause you to be trapped in a circle, it will break off in time but its good to lure it up a mountain etc if possible. Here's a video of our 2nd kill from a resto shammy PoV it may help see how we stand. It's a very clear video and you'll see many aspects of the fight including how to handle air burst, fires etc.<br>

We tank him south of the tree-stomp.<br>
<br>
We have 4 teams around her with 2 healers and 3 ranged DD each (team West has 2x ranged DD). The ranged DD include 1 decurser. We use 5 melees and one maintank.<br>
<br>
Ok, our problem is that some of our members have problems with this fight and some don't. <br>
We got one mage, one priest and one tree druid that always seem to get the fire and we really tried our best to make things clear how important it is to get as far away as possible. We are no raid that starts flamewar against each other, we try to reach things together no matter what it costs.<br>
<br>
There is so much room for failure in this 10min, something will go wrong. Sometimes we can handle a soul charge, sometimes we don't.<br>
<br>
I don't know, is there anything that we oversee in this fight? It becomes really frustrating right now <br>

		<div id="post_message_660971"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->We downed him again today after 8 tries. This week we had a much larger amount of ranged vs melee (we went down from 9 melee to 5 today + tank)<br>
<br>
Further observations on Doomfire to add to my post here: <a href="#undefined" target="_blank">Archimonde</a><br>
<br>
<br>
- I confirm that doomfire can never, ever, ever spawn on melee (50+ tries to my name)<br>
- The only time you think its spawned on melee is when melee is either feared out of hitbox or airbursted out of hit box<br>
- When your melee runs back to dps the boss, they wait for a doomfire to pop when tehy are far enough away. If they see the doomfire pop, they should strafe (there is a small fire arrow in front of the doomfire signifitying its direction) to see who has it and should kite it away; at this point the rest of the melee arcs around the doomfire and moves in<br>
<br>
I will post again if I get any more helpful fights, but from the data that I have available I can conclude:<br>
1. Melee is top DPS in this fight (6 melee topped the meters vs. very skilled and geared hunters, warlocks, mages, shadow priests)<br>
2. Melee is useful in this fight if they play with care.<br>
<br>
I don't see this as an encounter in which I would stack ranged.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

This is what I have learnt:<br>
1. You have to weed out those people who can't survive. I make people pay gold to a bounty for the boss, i've upped it to 50g per first death (unless it was due to a decurse).<br>
2. I sit out the people who continously die to this encounter<br>
3. The MT MUST stance dance (as you do). If you don't you will move the boss and cause melee to move out of hit box giving them the possibility of getting doomfired. If they say within hitbox, they cannot be doomfired unless someone trails it back after a fear or airburst.<br>
<br>
Don't start flame wars, just sit the people who die out. You can do this fight with 22 people (we got him to 18% with 22 people before 3 solid people logged in). Once people sit out because they can't concentrate, you willl notice that the fight becomes easier because i) the rest of the people will concentrate ii) you won't eat soul charges for no reason.<br>
<br>
Also I hope your druid is not playing in tree form - if he is, he cannot out run the doomfires or decurse and is a waste of a raid spot.<br>
<br>
I haven't been in a fight where 1 person dying can wipe the raid, this is by far the roughest one I've done, yet we downed him second day of tries due to some tough decisions on my part.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_660991"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->There are always "some" people who just never get it with doomfires.<br>
<br>
What we do, is assign 4 groups and 4 group leaders ... the group leaders have a raid target icon and they are of the non-retarded variety (ie never die to Doomfire). In each group is at least 1 healer and 1 decurser. The whole group stands DIRECTLY on that person and sticks to them like glue. If one of them gets airbursted, they all get airbusted ... and they have a healer plus a decurser with them when they land.<br>
<br>
This takes the "don't fucking die" responsibility away from the people who obviously cannot do it and places the responsibility on those that can do it.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_660992"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Coming from a guild that wiped something like 80 times learning Archi (more than any encounter and more than Vashj and Kael combined easily) and now one-shots it the majority of the time, I'd say this:<br>
<br>
Are Doomfires kitable?<br>
Yes. I used to do it and I personally am 100% convinced that it can be done.  Really.  No, really, really.  I've either been the luckiest son of a bitch ever or I attribute far too much random behavior to my own actions.  Either way, many dozens of working kites make me think it can work.<br>
<br>
Should you kite Doomfires?<br>
Probably not.<br>
We don't do anything anymore for dooms.  Everyone sidesteps or slips them or (rarely) runs away/kites them.  No one 'kites' them period.  We all spread out to silly distances on fears though and that serves the same effect.<br>
<br>
Erm, then, what should people do in general?<br>
Not die.<br>
Honestly, it seems like a technical fight but it isn't.   Fear timer almost up?  Run away.  Doomfire within 20 yards?  Run away.  Do it and you'll win every time.  You won't set dps records and you won't have a great fraps but if people don't die, you'll win.  The needed dps budget is so low that you can't help but win.  Keep in mind, 10% <b>is</b> a win.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>That. As a druid on this fight, you shouldn't be in treeform. You're gonna rely on mana pots if you heal a lot, but definitely not on treeform. I get about 40% of the decurse on this fight. Another 40% is the mage CL, and the rest is either the other druid or other mages. Even though you can cancel treeform when needed, I feel decursing before it ticks is too important to miss up, so you'll end up most of your time casting a decruse, switching to tree, casting a decurse, etc. Waste of mana. Throw hots on the tank when you're going close to him, but maintaining a full stack isn't always the most important thing. Getting away from doomfires and topping everyone off is more important imo, and this is what I do. Since I'm not getting fear wards, I let the healers who do manage the tank healing and only help when I'm in range, the rest of the time I spend it zoomed out trying to find places where there's no decursers, or travel forming to people who get low after an airburst to heal them while they're running back(lifebloom is especially good for that).<br>
<br>
<br>
As for the others, a mage should be able to mostly manage himself on this fight. He can iceblock a bad doomfire during a fear, he can absorb a big part of the initial ticks with flame ward until he gets some heals(and use his healthstone). He can negate the whole airburst crap. He can decurse himself. Mages should pretty much be the best ranged dps for this class because they have so many tools. Dieing to doomfires as a mage is unexcusable. As a priest, you really shouldn't either though. Outhealing the doomfire with instants is so easy, I hardly see how you can die to it. Shield yourself, then prom, then renew, all these can be done while running around. They also can be done as shadow, there's no reason to stay in shadowform if you're dieing, oom people do more dps than dead people.<br>
<br>
If they really suck, sit them out. It's one of these fights where doing it with idiots is harder than doing it without a full raid. Reminds me of Thaddius where we'd have 2people waiting on the side because they couldn't handle going left or right. Worked fine.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">- I confirm that doomfire can never, ever, ever spawn on melee (50+ tries to my name)<br>
- The only time you think its spawned on melee is when melee is either feared out of hitbox or airbursted out of hit box<br>
- When your melee runs back to dps the boss, they wait for a doomfire to pop when tehy are far enough away. If they see the doomfire pop, they should strafe (there is a small fire arrow in front of the doomfire signifitying its direction) to see who has it and should kite it away; at this point the rest of the melee arcs around the doomfire and moves in</div>

</div>This is slightly wrong - the hitbox for Archimonde is big enough that at least for some races, it is possible to melee Archimonde far enough back that you will eat a doomfire where you are standing.

We too started to take too long on the 4-camp strategy so we went back to the 180 strat. If you have problems with 4-camp strat, it may be worth trying this instead. Once we switched to this it took us no more than 5 attempts to hit the enrage timer with the whole raid alive - after that it was just a matter of improving dps by playing slightly less "safe"<br>
<br>
Here's one of the diagrams I made up for us:<br>

<br>
Basically the only people allowed behind the MT (dark green area) are our best Priest and best Paladin healer who we trust to look after themselves and dodge/kite doomfires coming their way. The Priest carries a bunch of Purification potions in case he runs out of range of a decurser.<br>
<br>
Put a raid icon on every decurser<br>
Call out every incoming Fear and tell people to get the heck away from any fire trails.<br>
If anyone sees a Doomfire infront of them they run in the direction of the arrows, NEVER sidestep a Doomfire<br>
Melee are told to stay out after Airburst until they are over 90% HP.<br>
With the 180 strat we put a Shaman and Druid on top of the melee. This means that the melee ALWAYS have a Decurser and a Fear totem with them. On top of this I ensure that all melee groups have a Fear totem on top of Racial/PvP trinket.<br>
<br>
It's all about personal survival - the enrage (dps) requirement is not huge.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_668101"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Probably one of the most important things for people new to this fight to recognize is what is bad luck and what is not bad luck.  Bad luck is when you get air burst and land right next to some doomfires just as fear is going off, use your trinket then on the next fear you somehow manage to run cross country, even though you purposefully ran way out of range just before the fear went off, through a doomfire and just as you hit the doom fire you picked up grip.  Bad luck is not I got grip right before an air burst or I had doomfire and got air burst or I got trapped between two doomfires just before a fear or whatever.  If you can explain it in under 40 words it wasn't bad luck.  Most of these things are from a lack of planning ahead of time.  In our case if you got gripped and then air burst you should have your decurser right next to you because you are supose to stay with your group, and in the case where you didn't, or couldn't you should still have your healthpot, healthstone, and maybe even a purification potion if you were ballsy and brought one with you to help you get back in range in time.  If you get air burst when you have doomfire you need to first figue out why did you get doomfire, odds are you got it because you didn't pay attention, and once again you should still have your healthpot and healthstone to help you get through it, not to mention you should have a healer in range of you because, one again, you should have been with your group.  And if you get caught in between two doomfires you didn't run away from the first one like you should have, and if you turned and ran only to find a doomfire already behind you you weren't looking ahead to begin with, and in worse case scenario you still should have your trinket up.  I've done this fight over 200 times since we first started learning it and the difference between then and now is that I can go whole fights without ever using my trinket or a health pot or a healthstone, and even if I do I never, ever, have to use any of those three things more than once every two minutes.  So they are always up.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_668804"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Tonight, my guild got our first kill of Archimonde. We had worked for a week or two using the four corners method, and were getting Archimonde sub 70% and slowly getting better. We stopped for a few weeks due to attendance issues and just worked on BT, but tonight, we came back (due to bad group makeup for Gurtogg/RoS), and used the mountain strategy. It took about an hour and a half from first pull to collecting loot, and personally, I felt bad about cheapening the encounter.<br>
<br>
Although loot is great, and progression is great, at what cost? Although we did have previous experience with the boss, with a radical tactic change, it is a very different fight. I was wondering how other people felt about using the mountain "strategy" on Archimonde. On one hand, Blizzard has stated multiple times that it is not an exploit. On the other hand, it takes one of the more difficult bosses, and dumbs it down to a 2ish hour learning curve. Even though staying with the 4 corners strategy would have taken longer, and more repair bills, when he finally dropped, I honestly felt like we had just dropped a trash mob. When you can minimize WoW from 24% to go check your dkp, and come back with a dead boss, there is something very wrong.<br>
<br>
With this in mind, how many people out there would like to see Archimonde changed? Personally, I feel that he should be changed. The mountain "strategy" cheapens the experience far beyond anything I have ever experienced in this game. Blizzard said that standing behind the spears on Mandokir was not an exploit (although standing between spears and wall was an exploit if I remember correctly), and they eventually removed a few spears and sloped the earth to remove that "strategy". Even though it would be a setback for my guild to have to go back to the 4 corners strategy, it would make Archimonde seem much more like an end boss, instead of a larger, tree draining version of Prince, except without infernals.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Links to said statements, please? Id like to see them change it such that you have to tank him in the field, with your choice of positioning in the field (AKA either him in middle and you spread out around him - or him on the side and raid in a big semicircle arc). And remove the bloody logs.<br>
<br>
Even if something is stated 'not an exploit' in terms of game mechanics - it could clearly be a highly unintended way of beating an encounter, such as the Mandokir example you described. The encounter designers surely didnt design the Arch encounter in a massive open field, with huge airbusts - for people to huddle in a very specific spot behind a tiny log or on a mountainside.<br>
<br>
The thing is.. (speaking for myself) Archimonde is one of the best encounters in wow. It can be relatively easy or incredibly frustrating/difficult - and what dictates that will be your strategy, communication and player skill/awareness. What might seem 'random' or 'totally unavoidable' at first will eventually be much more controllable than you first thought - with just a little practise. Thats the hallmark of good encounter design for me - like Cthun: its skill, communication and coordination that make the fight tangibly transform from difficult to relatively easy over time - not simply outgearing it or getting lucky. <br>
<br>
Executing the fight in a certain (unintended) way to change or trivialise any or part of that - could be depriving yourself of a enjoyable and satisfying boss encounter.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I don't have any links to the statements. A number of people said (I don't remember if they attached screenshots) that their conversations with GMs resulted in the statement that it was a clever use of in game mechanics, not an exploit.<br>
<br>
This mainly came to mind because as we were clearing Gurtogg trash, I realized that I quite honestly didn't feel anything when we killed Archimonde. My favorite part of raiding has always been the rush of killing a new boss. The last time I really felt that rush was killing Kael (after nerf). Bosses since then have provided small amounts of enjoyment, but Archimonde was something different. For the rest of the raid, I quite honestly felt dirty for using the mountains. Sitting there, throwing my knives at Archimonde, watching doomfires sit in one place at the bottom of hills not moving anywhere, and readjusting my junk and/or scratching it for 10 minutes did <i>not</i> seem like a boss fight.<br>
<br>
Using the 4 corners method, Archimonde seemed like a challenging, yet temperamental boss fight. It was not overly challenging, it just required people who only had 2 copies of their 21'st chromosome. The fight hinges on 20 people's (the 4 ranged groups) ability to turn 180 degrees, and run for 15ish seconds, then turn 180 degrees again, and return to their original place. It was not so much fighting a boss as it was fighting yourself and your guild, and working together to overcome yourselves. With your average raiding guild (and even the above average), this provides a hefty challenge. I wholeheartedly agree with you that you should not be able to trivialize an encounter like this simply by standing on a small hill or behind a log.<br>
<br>
After tonight, I felt like I had to go to confessional. Seeing how the EJ forums are like the Vatican of raiding, I felt that I should come clean about the dirty feeling i have had here, and hopefully help people reading this thread.<br>
<br>
If you are going to be fighting Archimonde, please use the 4 corners strategy. The mountain strategy takes a crucial part out of this counter, and removes any enjoyment from the encounter (in my experience). If you want to preserve your enjoyment of raiding content, <i>please</i> reconsider if your guild is planning on using the mountain strategy. Although the allure of quick, easy epics may be hard to overcome, for your own good, don't do it. This is coming from a member of a guild that just downed Archimonde using this strategy. If you raid strictly for epics, then by all means go ahead, but any of your motivation for raiding comes from the enjoyment of beating challenging content and feeling like you accomplished something, stay far, far away from this so called "strategy".<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Yea I have read similar comments about GM discussions. <br>
<br>
Ultimately the GM's didnt design the encounter - nor are they the ones who really would know whether something is should be deemed a exploit, <i>in terms of encounter design</i>. Standing on a log, or on a hillside (without really knowing how it affects the fight) might not be seen as a obvious exploit to a GM or passer by - but passing this information along to the Encounter Designer could potentially result in a very different answer. <br>
<br>
(To me) its glaringly obvious that stumphump/mountaineer are 'unintended'. In terms of Game mechanics, they might not be considered exploits by GM's - but in terms of the spirit of the encounters' design, it could be considered an exploit by the Designers, regardless of what any GM has said. Personally, I think that blizzard designers are so busy with 2.4, Wotlk etc to worry about devoting any resources to this matter - or it wouldve been fixed a few patches ago.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_669190"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Well, if you needed over <b>two </b>weeks just two bring him under 70%, several dozen hours of raiding... then is just something very wrong with your strategy. <br>
We needed about 80 serious trys, not counting the pull -&gt; tank's death or slackers dying before first fear. So, that's over 30 hours of wiping without counting breaks, waiting for disconnected people and so on. You really did it with 110% devotation and not just running three times against a wall and struggled?<br>
<br>
There are some ways to easily hit the enrage timer (eg. stay and die together as a assigned group, melee stay out of raid and are replaced with more healers or stay over 100 yards away, noone is dealing any damage and just heal the maintank). <br>
If you don't manage this, you should have to talk to your movement crippled players and solve the problems rather than using exploits like abusing mountains or the water to avoid doomfire.<br>
<br>
If you just can feel, that you are going to exploit something, why do you hold on that road? Killing chromaggus while abusing los to a critical amount (who remembers the drama?) or killing him while los'ing only the breaths felt completly differnt for every one of us.<br>
<br>
Just imagine you could do teron without becoming a ghost with just using di/soulstones or something like this. Wouldn't it be a completly different battle? Or bloodboil with no felrage phase and/or aggro reduce.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Sorry, didn't really explain our schedule. Tues/Wed/Thurs/Sat 6-10pm. two days in Hyjal, two in BT, first night would be rage-azgalor, and 30-60 minutes on Archimonde. Next day was all Archimonde. 2nd week we had better time on first 4, so more time for Archimonde. Wednesday we were sketchy on attendance, (0 mages, 1 feral+1 resto druid), so we went to BT instead, and stopped going to Archimonde for a couple weeks. This Saturday, we didnt have a good raid for RoS, so we went to Archimonde. My point with this is, we got a number of hours of attempts (although with a changing lineup of raiders, so we would have 2-3 new people on each night). We didn't try it for 30 minutes and decide it was too hard, and we didnt spend 30 hours getting him to 70%. In between (probably about 8 hours of solid attempts) there we decided it was worth more of our time at the time to focus on getting some progress in on BT.<br>
<br>
Anyhow, did you read my post? I came here confessing to my sin, and suggesting that other's not use the mountain strategy, as it cheapens the encounter, not looking for a critique on what I can't change at this point (although I hope we go back to using the 4 corners strat in the future).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_669227"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I understand that you wasn't trying him for two weeks constantly. But if you are looking for further progress in bt, there will allways be an officer who is trying to convince to take the easy way without that much trouble. <br>
<br>
We have a huge rooster (about 50 raiders, no core group) and had several replacements during our progressing on archimonde, slowing us down a lot. If you want it badly, you can do it. But it will take a lot of time and you will have to only do the farm bosses in bt and no progress raids there until your problem is solved.<br>
<br>
I didn't want to critisize you that badly, just wanted to point out that it may take a <u>lot</u> of time to kill him. Some guilds with smaller rooster and with excellent players will kill him in half of the time, but the real problem of that special fight is that every raider in your group have to understand what's the goal (surviving) and when they have gotten it you can really start progressing. Everything else is luck. <br>
We needed about two more month after our first kill until we had reliable first oder second try kills. No other fight should give you that much trouble besides illidan.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

This is a fact, however; if a person willingly sits out a raid due to the direction their moral compass is pointing, it is quite possible they will be removed from their guild, or the guilds raiding roster.  This can be a very tricky situation, as getting into another guild in that same caliber on the same server can be very difficult... especially in a class that is in general overpopulated.  So while it is easy to say just don't do it !  There are other things to consider.  <br>
<br>
I am glad you feel that way Lokthra, I can maintain my respect for you !  I went to bat for you on our own forums as a matter of fact.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_670879"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I spent a fair afternoon playing around in hyjal a few weeks ago and watching doomfire, as I mentioned there - the mountain positioning doesn't remove the fire from the fight, it simply increases the path time for the fire to your ranged, such that they are far less likely to be hit.  In turn it increases the hits per airburst and potentially forces your tank to stand in doomfire.<br>
<br>
SC kills him week in week out with a fine "stand in the field, don't burn to death" strategy, but the people saying "mountaineering is an exploit" strike me as having never actually seen a real exploit.  I won't comment on blizzard's intent, I'll simply mention that I spent enough time convincing myself that the fire could climb the hill (no matter others anecdotal experiences) to feel confident that the benefit to positioning near a mountain was purely hypotenal, not exploitive.<br>
<br>
If you're taking 80+ attempts to kill him, something is fundamentally wrong with your raiders or your strategy.  Either they fail at recognizing the burning fire or you have failed at properly assigning them to tasks.  I certainly can see how a change in positioning would force a reordering of assignments and could fix issues that had not been acknowledged, but I don't believe the line of "it's a totally different fight".  Spend a few hours in your empty hyjal with a paladin buddy and watch how doomfire will happily climb the walls.  It certainly takes longer to reach you than it does at max range on the ground, but not by more than a second or two.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>This is like saying "Tanking prince at the doorway didnt remove infernals from the fight". No, it doesnt remove it - but drastically changes the fight mechanics. Its easy to say in passing, 'it simply increases the path time" - but thats a huge and important part of the fight altered greatly. The infernal <i>could</i> still land on the tank, but who are we kidding... it obviously wasnt intended.<br>

</div>People draw two different ways to define what they call 'exploit' generally<br>
<br>
- Obvious game mechanics expoit. Example would be flying above the ground or something stupidly obvious like that.<br>
- Encounter exploits which go against the spirit of the intended encounter design. This is more what the prince/infernal, heigan/safespot, archimonde/log/mountain one fall more into. People might consider them 'Creative' etc - they might not necessarily be blatent game exploits like flying, but that doesnt mean its not exploiting the intended way the designers wanted you to experience the encounter.<br>
<br>
The authoritative answer, of course, would have to come from the designers - but Im sure they have better things to do (Like making WOLTK, Sunwell) than bother themself with a meeting discussing the merits of the log/mountain in Archimondes room. <!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I don't know what mountain positioning you used, but what I saw, was that on our kill, a grand total of 2 doomfires, the <b>whole</b> attempt went around. The vast majority of the doomfires consisted of 24 patches of fire stacked on top of eachother at the base of the mountains. Just because they <i>can</i> go around on rare occasion doesn't mean that they will. If you are using this logic to convince yourself that this "strat" is completely legit, you are delusional. With the mountain strat, people can go afk during the fight, and still profit. I left in the middle to take a piss, and then at low % I alt tabbed out of the game to check forums/dkp. In normal Archimonde, this will result in a wipe. With the mountain "strat", it doesn't matter. The mountain strategy takes the individual human element out of the fight to such a degree that it is embarrassing to me watching it. This fight goes from a complex movement oriented fight where all 25 people have to pay attention, to a tank sitting in the trees, some healers healing him, and 15 of those little bird toys bobbing their heads up and down on your [insert spell/shot here] key. That is really all that the fight comes down to. One decurser can handle all of the decursing, a few healers can handle the tank, and you don't even have to fucking use your tears to survive the airbursts.<br>
<br>
Are you seriously saying that this strat is legit?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_675773"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->So this may be my first post on these boards (been lurking here forever).<br>
<br>
I'd have to say the single most important advice I can give to any guild still working on this asshole is patience!<br>
We killed Archimonde last night for the first time (attempt #73 which seems around average) with zero deaths.  <br>
<br>
Our biggest issues were (prior to the death) brain-farting and cratering and being too embarassed to call out if you got doomfired.  Honestly, if there's a couple of people that are doomfired it's not the end of the world.  A couple of hots and they're fine.  Once I stressed to players to avoid the fires but call out if you get them things went much smoother (especially from a healer's perspective).<br>
<br>
As for the 'retard check', if you can get this boss to at least 50% with zero people dead, you can get him to 10% with zero people dead.  Once everyone gets airblasted / feared a few times they figure it out (well, most of them do).<br>
<br>
BTW if anyone is interested, we enforced the 2min trinket rule (had only 2 shaman in the raid last night) and we used the 4-corner method.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

your healer's desire is an adjustable raidframe like eg. grid where they can see all those doomfires and/or curses. Should raise the reaction reflexes. Don't abuse your vent/teamspeak and create an input overflow with calling out every doomfired person.<br>
<br>
What really helped us was seperating the groups on different teamspeak channels and let them have some relaxing trash talks during the encounter. Having 8-12 eyes watching for exactly your spot and the first one seeing it calling out the incoming doomfire works excellent.<br>

Don't think there's much about it. I guess everyone including Joe Casual should realise what's to do after his 5th attempt at last. But assembling this can take a looong time, especially when you are only really challenged every few attempts.

				<div style="font-style:italic">People draw two different ways to define what they call 'exploit' generally<br>
<br>
- Obvious game mechanics expoit. Example would be flying above the ground or something stupidly obvious like that.<br>
- Encounter exploits which go against the spirit of the intended encounter design. This is more what the prince/infernal, heigan/safespot, archimonde/log/mountain one fall more into. People might consider them 'Creative' etc - they might not necessarily be blatent game exploits like flying, but that doesnt mean its not exploiting the intended way the designers wanted you to experience the encounter.<br>
<br>
The authoritative answer, of course, would have to come from the designers - but Im sure they have better things to do (Like making WOLTK, Sunwell) than bother themself with a meeting discussing the merits of the log/mountain in Archimondes room. </div>

</div>Standing in a spot the game allows you to walk to without any wall jumping is obviously not an "exploit" in any truly abusive sense, but there is a reasonably well confirmed rumor that an invisible barrier has been placed at the hill base making it imposible to even walk up the hills at all in 2.4. When I say reasonably well confirmed, a guildmate of mine zoned in on PTR before it got taken down just to look around and see.<br>
<br>
So apparently, the development team didn't like people standing there and felt this was easily fixed with an arbitrary barrier. But it's kind of offensive to kind standing in guy's field an exploit. Lazy? Sure. Intended? Unlikely. Exploitive? I'd say no more say than beating Loatheb with 5 people at lvl 60 using the shadow priest gimmick. Archimonde is in many ways a less ridiculous fight than Loatheb was (lack of ridiculous consumables), but the somewhat unique feature of being able to make so many rapid attempts -- you can be back dying again and pulling awfully quickly -- and having nearly any individual kill your raid is doubtless what led someone to look for alternatives in the first place.<br>
<br>
Anyway, it may well be fixed in a week.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_678486"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I'm having some difficulty finding an exact explanation regarding the nature of doomfires. So far, I've realised that "some follow" "some follow than change target" "some are random". Could anybody provide a rock solid 100% accurate description of them.<br>
<br>
My guild have been killing archimonde for a few months now, yet it always takes a few hours to kill him. We have tried 'take risks but get him down faster' and we have also tried 'take no risks but tickle the enrage timer'.<br>
<br>
We use the strategy where we tank Archi to the right of the tree debris (looking from the back, towards the well). We split the raid into 4 groups, spread out over a 180 degree arc behind archimonde. We have no problems with the tank dying in fears or other trivial deaths like these. Our problem sources from doomfires curling around and into the melee, which are doing the majoritory of the damage.<br>
<br>
As far as I know, we are all running from the doomfires in a linear fashion, and even moving as groups instead of individually to avoid problems with the doomfire switching targets. <br>
<br>
Has anybody else hit a brick wall like that explained above? <br>
Any feedback would be fantastic.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
As far as constant Doomfires in the melee, well, I've seen it happen on a few attempts, but it usually means that you've got people who still think they can strafe. I know it happens a lot with us. Speaking of which, has anyone else noticed that this is the <i>only</i> fight where the ranged group seems to understand strafing away from things that want to hurt them? It's kind of frustrating to see people deftly sidestepping Doomfire so that they get feared along the entire length and it chains back into the melee, but utterly incapable of, say, getting out of a giant burning patch on Al'ar if they aren't on the edge.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I moderately disagree.   I only really see Doomfires in melee in two situations:<br>
<br>
(a) a healer, moderately close to the MT and Melee, is near doomfire and runs forward, thus kiting the fire towards the melee.<br>
<br>
(b)  Doomfire chases a ranged dps, who 'jukes' the Doomfire to turn it a bit inside.  Doomfire then wanders randomly and happens to get near melee.<br>
<br>
Both problems are remedied by having people run *away* from the raid just a little bit before they sidestep.  <br>
<br>
Honestly, when I dps on Archimonde it's so profoundly boring (immune to fear and airburst) that I don't even bother to move when a doomfire spawns two feet behind me (you can attack Archimonde and be 'within' the doomfire spawn radius) because I have *never*, *ever* seen a Doomfire spawn and turn towards melee without first heading 'out'.   To me, Melee is the safest place to be in the fight.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_678671"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Doomfires always head out after spawning, this is true, but after they head out they may come back again. I've seen them spawn and then head straight into the hills with absolutely no one in front of them, and have never had consistent success kiting them myself (they always seem to follow me for a while and then lose interest and head elsewhere). So what we do is tell the melee to watch and tell everyone else to call doomfires that head melee-ward, and if one wanders in there the melee gets out.<br>
<br>
Edit: That they can head off following no one does not refute that they might be kitable. I've just never managed to kite them with confidence, and I consider myself a much better player and faster learner than many of the people in my raid, so I concluded that it wasn't worth trying to teach my entire raid to kite them.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Doomfires appear to switch between two modes randomly:<br>
a) Follow a random player<br>
b) Move in a random direction.  <br>

So when people say 'kite the doomfires' people shouldnt be under the impression that means it will follow you until it despawns.

</div>Yeah, I've operated under the theory that the doomfire has a 90 degree (or something bigger than 90 degrees, perhaps 150 degrees or so) cone from which it can select people to follow, when following it faces toward the person it is following and it will periodically pick new targets to follow, thus side strafing makes it very easy to turn the doomfire towards another one of your groups (imagine it's facing west, half way to your west group, and the person being followed dodges north, turning the doomfire north enough to pick a target in the north group, from there the doomfire is facing north-west and this places the melee and tank at archimonde within the cone of available targets, on the next target selection, one of them is randomly picked, and the doomfire has now looped back at melee.<br>
<br>
I don't think inward turns and loops ever happen naturally, I think the doomfire always naturally travels forwards in a straight line, it only appears to curve when it randomly selects a new target and alters it's heading to face the new target.  I do think it can change target selections fairly often (but doesn't always do so.)<br>
<br>
Of course this is just the mental model I operate with, and while I've seen this fight plenty of times, I can't claim to have enough observational data  to know how accurate/inaccurate this model is (particularly since as the tank, since I never experience running from the doomfires personally.)  That said, I find it useful to think about doomfire like this, and certainly I think it'd be useful to refine the model, the better we can describe the characteristics of how a doomfire paths/targets the easier it will be for people learning the fight in the future.<br>
<br>
Along these lines we found that making sure our groups stay close together dramatically reduced the risk of a doomfire curving back towards melee (I imagine because it would rapidly switch from people a bit too spread out and manage to turn itself inwards in the process.)  By having each group really hug a marked person in their assigne direction we dramatically reduced the number of doomfires we see hit our melee.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Yeah, that has been my experience as well. When I see a doomfire heading towards me I don't strafe or try to do anything funny... I just turn 180 degrees and run away, usually at least until I'm outside of fear range. Most of the times it'll either be still following me or targeting some random tree stump, which is much better than having it curl and destroy the melee. It also means that I spend a lot of time on Archi just watching the scenery as I wait for doomfires to despawn - ranged DPS really just has to learn to be patient and trust the melee to kill him.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

In a situation where you have 25 people fairly evenly spread out over an area any randomly chosen direction is more than likely going to point towards someone.  <br>
<br>
The nature of doomfire isn't important.  The fact that no one has ever been able to 100% control doomfires given even perfect execution testifies to this.  What is important is properly preparing and knowing how to react to doomfires.  Melee should assume every doomfire is going to head their way and be looking for it ahead of time.  Ranged should always run back to avoid a doomfire initially, not to "kite" the back but because that is the place least likely to have another doomfire in it, running to wards the side is what leads to people getting boxed in.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Yes, the nature of the doomfire <i>is</i> important. Simply because they arent <i>100</i>% controllable doesnt mean any techniques used to help control the doomfire should be thrown out the window. Properly preparing and knowing how to react etc - is complementary to this, not mutually exclusive.<br>

</div>Not really - in a 4-point square setup with Archimonde in the middle... if a doomfire is at one of the four points, the rest of the raid (aka the other 3 points)  is within a 90degree arc only. If it really does move in a 'random direction' frmo there , chances are it will head into the 270 degree arc area where nobody is anyway. The only real time what you said holds true (with this positioning anyway) is when the doomfire is within the square itself - which is why kiting it away in a straight line as far as possible (during the period it decides to actually follow you) is most important.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>
