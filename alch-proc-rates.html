</div>Edit: being boneheaded - by "1x", you mean that the mastery didn't proc...<br>
<br>
<br>
The simplest model would be a single probability to proc, and that it can then proc off itself, thus generating 2x, 3x... etc. procs.  Presumably capped at a quad-proc (i.e. 5 items), since I've never heard of getting more than that.<br>
<br>
The above figures are roughly consistent with a 15% proc probability, but there's a lot of variability, presumably due to the sample size.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_330888"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->The key problem is that they seem to be using the same percentages for elixirs and potions as for transmutes, presumably on the reasoning that the same percentage increase in output for all masteries is "fair".<br>
<br>
It isn't - because the extra stuff you get from a proc is essentially pure profit. <br>
<br>
Thus what the masteries actually do is increase your profit by a set percentage of your total turnover.  Total turnover is an order of magnitude less for transmuting.<br>
<br>
The market will correct this in the end (if it hasn't already), in that the returns from potions and elixir masteries will end up factored into the sale price.  Potions will sell for less than their "true" price, in exactly sufficient proportion to negate the gains from mastery.  Thus instead of being a bonus for those with the mastery, it actually ends up as a penalty for those *without* the mastery.<br>
<br>
When a sufficient number of people (say a dozen or so per server) have a given recipe, craters cannot make a profit on that recipe any more.  It's simple economics.  The value added by crafting is essentially nil.  I'm not sure how to fix it, and I don't think Blizzard have a clue either.<br>
<br>
Crafting professions are a wash - and I say that as one who's made quite a lot of money jewelcrafting.  Because it's the gathering (prospecting)  that makes me the money, not the crafting.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Looks like generally transmute masters are the ones keeping tabs, which makes sense since it's such a gamble considering the time between xmutes. I'm hoping the 1 day turnaround time for the transmuted gems will prove to be somewhat profitable if you have a mining alt come the patch, but with all the new stuff out there, probably not.<br>

		<div id="post_message_331011"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I thought I read somewhere that the proc was a simple 1/6 with each item being able to proc another proc.<br>
<br>
However I think that they need to change how this works for transmutation specialization. As others have mentioned, transmutes have an extra constraint that limits them -- cooldown. You can roll that die over and over as long as you have mats for potions/elixirs, but transmutes limit you to at best one roll a day.<br>
<br>
Pretty lousy. I've done a transmute every day since I started to get them and have had two procs of my specialization. No double procs or beyond. I hardly feel like this is worth it. I should have just gone into potion specialization and gotten free mana pots.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_331036"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Air generally goes on my server for 30~ gold, where water tends to go for 20~.  Transmuting earth to water is definitely more profitable for me as a daily transmute when I just need to burn my timer.  (And, Sporregor revered is quite easy to reach.)<br>
<br>
The only thing that I could see being better would be Transmute Primal Shadow to Water, but as far as I know that is a discovery recipe.<br>
<br>
As far as transmuting Primal Might...  its only good if you are farming the mats for it yourself.  If you take the time to farm your might mats (1 primal of each) daily, or do what I did and farm 5-6 water and fire on Saturdays and 5-6 mana and air on Sundays, you are set to make at least 450 gold in that week just from your timer (miners in your guild will likely give you earth for free, worst case is you farm/AH those too).  And if you are a transmute master, you may proc for even more, which makes up for the fact that the mats themselves may be worth more than the mights.<br>
<br>
And while its true that selling the mats themselves might bring a better profit, keep in mind that the primal fire/water/air/mana markets are generally more competitive than the might market due to AH inventory.  There are times you can get 110+ for a might on the AH due to low/no inventory, and other times when you will have to settle for 85-90g.  But with primals like fire and air, if you wish to sell you are usually going to have to undercut 10-20 other people on the market rather than the 5-7 at most you will usually see with mights.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I'm sure the people offering free transmutes are the same as I am -- they're taking a Might they already have, trading it for mats, and then transmuting those mats whenever the clock is up in hopes of a proc. It's the only way I can actually make money transmuting, but with the proc rate so low even that just feels like a waste.<br>
<br>
I'm horrible about things like rep grinds (if you look at my armory, everyone is pretty much a tick above revered) and so I don't have Earth &gt; Water yet, but with the absolutely dismal results I'm getting with my mastery I should probably follow advice and just buy Earth to transmute to Water instead of wasting my time on Might.<br>
<br>
I don't even want to talk about how ALL THREE of those procs I got were transmute for guildmates, which I can't in good conscience keep the extras from.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

My Mongoose enchant cost me over 1100g too.<br>

Then again, mine is also the type of server where you can easily still turn a profit buying greens, DEing them and selling the results. Ditto for prospecting ore. It's a bit weird really.<br>

My most recent moneymaking scheme was Netherweb, which is insanely easy to farm outside Shattrath in between BGs / Arenas. I've probably sold at least 30 at 8g each in the last 2 weeks. Though the price is now slipping towards 5g at last (all the tailors are finished, maybe?)<br>

</div>You're not really sitting in trade -- I generally see "WTB Might Xmute" at some point during the evening when I'm in a major city. If not, then I either use my mats (which I try to stockpile for just this scenario), see if anyone in guild needs an xmute, or transmute a gem (it won't hurt nearly as much to do this come 2.1).<br>
<br>
And honestly, I'm suprised not more xmute masters do this. If I'm not burning a cooldown I also don't charge for the xmute though either, so I have repeat business I can count on as well.</div>

</div>Ditto for me.  I specced Transmute I believe week two of the expansion.  It was painful to burn some cash on those early Mights.  But over the next three weeks or so, I had 3 - 2x mights.  So I'm thinking hey, almost payed off my initial investment, and soon it will be all profit.<br>
<br>
Then the RNG turned evil on me.  I went the next 20-23 transmutes without a single proc.  I started to grumble like many others.<br>
<br>
But then I hit a 3x and a 2x on back to back nights. (And finally made my Alchemist Stone from this)<br>
<br>
Now I don't sweat it so much.  I've made back my initial investment, and the mights for my Alchemist Stone.  The procs will happen, and I'll take the profit as it comes.</div>

		<div id="post_message_331527 intelliTXT">I can see why people are dissapointed in the transmute spec because of the large start up costs and random rewards, but I personally don't have any complaints.<br>
<br>
Before TBC I didn't bother with arcanite transmutes and instead transmuted essence of water to air for a steady source of income I was happy with.  Now I ignore primal might transmutes and instead make a steady income from earth to water or earth to air.  I got a bit lucky with the transmutes for my alchemists stone, so transmute spec has already paid for itself.  Now it contributes about 5g of the 15g a day I make from transmutes, and I will get this income essentially for free for over a year.  When I need to make raid consumables I send the mats to guild alchemists with a different spec and they are happy with the extra chances for discoveries.<br>
<br>
If I didn't like my alchemist's stone so much I might drop alchemy, but as it is I have an alt  with the gathering professions anyway.  The only odd thing is the temptation to get the epic mount for my gathering alt instead of my main.</div>

</div>I hate giving away secrets, but your scheme is terrible.  Go buy a primal earth for 4-5g, transmute it to water and you've just made at least 15g per transmute (primal water is 20g on my server).  That's double what you're getting.  You can do your same "stockpile" trick and wait for a good time to dump them all on the AH.</div>

</div>That is, you can do this on the PTR, I haven't seen any confirmation that this is going live. I'd be very surprised if they made it that cheap and simple.<br>

As for my transmutes, I've done ten and I've seen one proc (2x).</div>

		<div id="post_message_332210 intelliTXT">Y'know, it occurs to me that there's another way to make a little money off of Mights.  If people really are taking Mights they already have and trading them for the mats rather than doing the transmute, then you don't even need to be an alchemist to profit it from it.  If Mights sell for less than the constituent mats, just buy a Might, trade it for 5 primals, and sell those.<br>
<br>
The market should eventually correct for this, and it won't work on every server economy, but hey it's worth a shot.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Water-&gt;Air is currently more profitable than might on my server anyway.<br>
<br>
I don't have a total # of transmutes performed, although I'd guess it somewhere in the 20-30 range, but I've seen 3 x2 procs, 1 x4 proc, and the rest have all been single.</div>

</div>Per xmute, Water&gt;air is more profitable.  But you get most of the profit from water &gt; air without xmute spec.  A proc is worth ~35g on my server.  A Might proc is worth 100g on my server.  Of course, the base xmute of might currently loses money anyway.<br>
<br>
Thus, I just sell my xmute for free or really cheap.   If someone spams "selling primal might xmute, 5g" I just spam it for 1g.  I get 3 to 5 tells sometimes, and -- trade mights for the more valuable primals without xmuting.   Profit!</div>

Heck, why even bother having alchemy at all when you can sell primal "transmutes" and reclaim the more valuable primals to resell?</div>

Arcanite bars, however, are solidly 10-15g above the buyout price of the thorium and crystal, so until I finish grinding Sporeggar rep, that's where I'll be spending my cooldown on.<br>
