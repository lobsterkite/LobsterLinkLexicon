		<div id="post_message_321903"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Engineering seems very tame, that epic helm must be insane for it to be any point in taking :\<br>
<br>
Alchemy<br>
<br>
<br>
* Elixirs now stack in two categories, Battle (Offensive) and Guardian (Defensive) Elixirs. You can only have one of each type of Elixir up at a time. As a result Elixirs now stack with class abilities such as "Arcane Intellect."<br>
* Four new defensive elixirs have been added. Two are on trainers, one is in Halaa and one is in Cenarion Expedition.<br>
* "Flask of Petrification" can no longer be turned off during its duration, but it now will clear all threat from all monsters for the duration of the effect. Though monsters may reaquire you after the effect ends.<br>
* The cost to purchase Imbued Vials has been reduced.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Enchanting<br>
<br>
<br>
* Enchant Bracer-Spellpower had its primal costs reduced slightly.<br>
* Enchanting recipes that increase spell damage now also increase healing as well.<br>
* The "Major Defense Bracer" enchantment has been moved from Ethereum Researchers to Ethereum Nullifiers.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Engineering<br>
<br>
<br>
* A recipe for "Frost Grenades" and the "Icy Blasting Primers" needed to make them are now on engineering trainers.<br>
* Engineering recipes can now be placed in engineering bags, as can engineer made fireworks.<br>
* Many engineering recipes will now give skillups for longer than the previously did.<br>
* "Seaforium" now opens locked chests as well as locked doors<br>
* The Poultryizer and Nigh Invulnerability Belt now cause mishaps less often.<br>
* The Goblin Rocket Launcher cooldown has been reduced significantly.<br>
* 11 new epic goggles have been introduced at 350 engineering skill and are available from the trainer. They range from cloth to plate, and have a variety of stats to appeal to most talent specs.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Fishing<br>
<br>
<br>
* The fishing timer has been reduced from 30 to 20 seconds and it now takes less time to fish.<br>
* The fishing timer can no longer run through its duration without a fish biting.<br>
* Fishing has been removed from Arathi Basin and Alterac Valley.<br>
* You can now fish in Underbog.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Jewelcrafting<br>
<br>
<br>
* The jewelcrafting UI now has gems split up by color so it is easier to find gems of a specific color to create.<br>
* A number new gem cuts to existing gems have been added to the game. Included among them are a spell hit gem and more multi-stat gems that have attack power on them.<br>
* Jewelcrafters can make two new melee oriented meta gems. One is found randomly as a world drop and the other sold by the &lt;Faction&gt; reputation vendor.<br>
* Thorium requirements for most recipes has been reduced.<br>
* Prospecting now always yields at least 1 gem. Overall, the amount of gems received from prospecting has been increased.<br>
* New recipes have been added that use the Jaggal and Shadow Pearls.<br>
<br>
<br>
Leatherworking<br>
<br>
<br>
* Skinning higher level creatures will give more leather; you will no longer get a single leather scrap.<br>
* "Knothide Armor" kits now require less leather to make and give skill increases for longer.<br>
* Leatherworking made primalstrike set now has an attack power set bonus rather than a strength set bonus.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
Also...Primalstrike using AP instead of STR eh?  Prolly good for rogues...potentially worse off for feral druids unless they consider the face druids get more then 2 AP per STR.<br>
<br>
But what concerns did they Completely miss?  The fact to level from 350+ EVERYTHING requires Primals?  Or the fact that skinning still pails in comparison to other gathering professions?

</div>I'm thinking the price for blue quality gems are going to come down a bunch. <br>
<br>
Right now gems are going for 60g a pop and 90g cut on the AH. 20-30g Seems like a much more reasonable price. The cost of upgrading 10 gems from green quality to blue quality is approx. 600g for 10 approx 10 dmg/crit.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I'd like to see more blue gems and fewer greens.  It's a pain in the bum having to vendor the green ones, and the price differential green-&gt;blue is ludicrous given how small an incremental stat gain it is.<br>
<br>
Personally I'd have given a combine recipe to turn greens into blues, but I guess that would be hard to explain in lore / geology terms. :-)    Tweaking the percentages should have a similar effect - if they tuned it so greens sell for 4-5g and blues for  25-30g, I'd say that's about right.<br>
<br>
What would be really nice is some better yellow or blue effects to boost that side of the spectrum.  Right now, red has all the most desirable stats except stamina.  Blue is useful for stamina and nothing else, while pure yellow is almost never wanted.  The mixed gem prices reflect that too, with purples and oranges selling much better than green.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_321962"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->The elixir change is only a bandaid on a very large wound.  So you save the equivalent of 2-3 elixirs per death, but you die more because you have less elixirs...  Sigh.<br>
<br>
Consequently, so is the engineering change.  The biggest problem with engineering consumables, by far, is that the cost outweighs the rewards.  Seaforium charges for blowing open chests is nice...  But if it costs more to open a chest than you can get from its contents (and it certainly will if you're sharing the loot between five people), what's the point? If it takes elemental blasting powder to create (motes of fire are ~1.5 g EACH), this idea is worthless.  <br>
<br>
As far as frost grenades &amp; epic goggles go...  If that's the best they can come up with, Blizzard has really lost its edge.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Agreed.  All this change will do is make 4-5 different elixirs the only ones ever made and drive the price of the herbs used in those few up quite a bit.  Making them last through death or cut materials in half would have been a much better change<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Great, so now instead of using Fel Strength + Major Agi + Flask it'll be Fel Strength + Flask.   Still +480ap from potions - this is such a minor nerf, they don't even need to retune encounters (past what is already necessary due to all the broken raid bosses). <br>
<br>
Flasks need to be removed from the game, and elixirs need to last through death.  Add some more BoP frills to Alchemy to compensate and call it a day.<br>
<br>
As a side note, Fel Strength Elixirs aren't correctly flagged as elixirs right now, so this change will have even less of an effect on melee than it's supposed to, unless that's fixed.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
edit: since flasks proc off elixir spec, maybe they do qualify as elixirs?  I sincerely hope so.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>This was my thought exactly, and it might mean that this is more of a change than it sounds like. If flasks are elixirs, then you have, at most, one flask, and an elixir of the opposite type.<br>
<br>
You still face problems of scaling (even those two consumables dwarf gear progression upgrades) and of potion chain-chugging, but the decrease in the amount of effort involved in fully buffing does get pretty heavily reduced: a single flask, or a single elixir, in your primary area, and possibly a contrasting elixir.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

The prospecting change is also interesting.  It is already more profitable to prospect your ore and sell the gems than sell it in bar form.

<i>The 2.1 Alchemy Checklist</i><br>
1. Casters chain chugging Mana potions still? Check.<br>
2. Tanks chain chugging Stoneshields still? Check.<br>
3. Full flasking of raids still? Check.<br>

Update: God responses are fast. I hope this preview is not all there is, and admittedly, the 'General forums concerns' are not the raiding community concerns so I can understand to some extent why they would focus on what they did.

This change is decent, but we still actually have to farm for them, plus now it feels like we would be expected to have them at all times. Any one of the above I believe would fix things right up.<br>

As for Engineering, I thought it was very disappointing. Unless the Goggles have some incredible stats and bonuses on them, I don't see too many making them. Hopefully they will be meaningful items, rather then just 'toys', but we'll see.<br>
<br>
What I was hoping to see with Engineering was Gun/Wand/Relic/Trinket epic patterns (something which benefits more then one class), which can be upgraded through Primal Nether and Nether Vortexes, just like the Blacksmithing patterns. I think that type of thing would be very popular.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Capping players to two elixirs is the 'big' alchemy changes then? So one Flask of Relentless Assault/Supreme Power/Titans will still be the price of raiding each night then. Since when was the cost of Imbued Vials really the problem with raiding consumables?<br>
<br>
<i>The 2.1 Alchemy Checklist</i><br>
1. Casters chain chugging Mana potions still? Check.<br>
2. Tanks chain chugging Stoneshields still? Check.<br>
3. Full flasking of raids still? Check.<br>
4. Herbalism still the most important raiding profession? Check.<br>
5. Full buffs is two elixirs + food + flask + world buffs? Check.<br>
<br>
<b>Meet the new Alchemy, same as the old Alchemy.</b><br>
<br>
Update: God responses are fast. I hope this preview is not all there is, and admittedly, the 'General forums concerns' are not the raiding community concerns so I can understand to some extent why they would focus on what they did. But right now, I don't see anything groundbreaking.</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->It's almost as if they have no clue why people were upset about alchemy. As you noted, potions are still going to be a huge part of raiding consumable usage for many classes. Maybe flasks count as an elixir, maybe not, but they are still going to be needed. Plus now this removes the ability to really pot up to the absolute gills in order to get a first kill, which is something that many people didn't mind and found fun. So I have to use fewer consumables on old content, but with the lack of gear scaling, <i>I still have to use them, and that's the problem.</i> <br>
<br>
Also, say goodbye to ever seeing certain elixirs...Empowerment and Strength for starters, and quite possibly Mastery, depending on how it is classed.</div>

Looks like it is a combat elixier. A few weeks ago with the old client my elixiers were already classified and Mastery definitely was a combat elixier.

I don't know about you guys, but I can't wait for the raiding game to pick back up to the point where you have Loatheb/Sapphiron style encounters where you get to chug these pots every 2 minutes.  25 gold per primal + the cost of mana thistle every 2 minutes sure sounds appealing to me.</div>

The Hunter/Shaman one is stam/int/ap/crit/mp5/sockets, so I don't think it's unreasonable to expect Primalstrike to get MUCH better.<br>

One band-aid to LW that would INSTANTLY make the tradeskill much more appealing? Drums of Restoration trainable. Those things just scream overpowered -- 31 mp5 / hp5 for the PARTY. The fact that the recipe is an un-farmable world drop is ridiculously asinine.</div>

Everyone is going to obviously want to best elixir possible, and for all melee, this probably means Fel Strength and lots of competition for the mats for Fel Strength. I don't want to be 'forced' into taking a less powerful elixir because its impossible to get the herbs for the best one, and im sure neither does anyone else. On the other hand, lesser is better then nothing and im sure the difference isn't THAT huge, I could potentially use Moongoose Elixirs.</div>

The change to skinning is nice but doesn't address the main problem with gathering materials for LWing...the goddamn primals.  You have to farm SO MANY primals and spend so much time to get your LWing to 375...and then all you get is poorly-itemized sets that will be obsolete in a few months with absolutely NO prospects for further advancement.  Just a one-shot deal.  The Dragonscale LWing sets are okay on their own (let's ignore the fact that there is exactly ONE kind of dragonscale that you can possibly get in Outland).  But they're still underbudget and there's some totally asinine mistakes that suggest Blizzard didn't even double-check the itemization.  +Agi for the socket bonuses on the ELEMENTAL SHAMAN set?  You kidding?  The only 2 items I regularly craft are Drums of Battle (recipe requires exalted Sha'tar) and Drums of Restoration...AMAZING consumable, really shows the potential of the profession, but as mentioned not farmable.  I was just lucky enough to have a guildmate's alt stumble upon the recipe in HFP.</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->It's the worst issue, but even after fixing that Skinning is still <b>by far</b> the worst gathering profession.  You can't just fly, drop, skin, mount, and fly away.  There's no motes to speak of.  There's probably more mobs to <b>herb</b> than to skin in all the instances.  There's no little bonus like gems, or quirks like herb gathering buffs.<br>
<br>
Also, unlike Herbalism or Mining, Skinning cannot stand on its own.  The tiers of Knothide force you into at least having a friend in Leatherworking to make it so that one stack is actually worth anything.<br>
<br>
Actually bringing Skinning into Leatherworking is the first idea I've heard that would make me not think it's strictly inferior to the other gathering skills.  It might need tweaking to balance the extra profession space people would gain, but, hell, tailoring is incredibly powerful right now without requiring any gathering profession/ability whatsoever.</div>

		<div id="post_message_322161" class="post_message_underline" style="min-height: 183px;">As a LWer and a Skinner I've been personally ticked off to get that one damn scrap so many times I can't even remember.  However, some people have been pointing out that skinning is unlike all other gathering professions in that you actually have to kill stuff to farm it.  This, in and of itself, makes skinning a much more time intensive gathering profession and, as has been mentioned, doesn't grant any of the other perks like gems, motes, random buffs, etc.  However, the one thing that I've comfortmed myself with is the other random crap that drops of mobs that I skin.  Especially in outland the stacks of teeth, tufts of fur, ocassional random drops, etc all have a fairly good vendor price per stack.  The other thing I like is the fact that I've coupled Cooking nicely with Skinning so that I can pretty much bring a stack of stat food per person to any given raid.  <br>
<br>
While this is in no way an arguement to keep skinning as it is, perhaps these are the "balancing factors" that Blizzard uses to rationalize the skinning profession.  I mean, at least there is SOME exterior benefit to actually having to kill mobs in order to gather from them.  <br>
<br>
Not withstanding, I'd love to see skinning incorporated into LWing and thus freeing up a second profession slot for something else.</div>

Theres just never really been much justification to be a skinner unless you were a LW'er, herbing or mining is alot more useful &amp; profitable, heck even fishing is more valuable imo.</div>

		<div id="post_message_322189" class="post_message_underline">Regarding flasks vs elixirs, I would definitely take Tigole's post into consideration.  He deliberately states flasks and elixirs as two separate entities and goes on to state that BOTH will be changed.  The listed changes really only change elixirs and have no mention of flasks, therefore I think we can logically conclude that there are upcoming changes for flasks, we just don't know about them yet.<br>
<br>
2 Elixirs max is a nice change, although I do see many elixirs never being used again.  Still, it will be much better than carrying around 20 stacks of elixirs to a raid and chain chugging them all night.  Granted I wouldn't use this amount of consumables on anything but first kill fights, there were just so many different elixirs you could use it was ridiculous... defense, mastery, strength, onslaught, fortitude, agility...  <br>
<br>
So now that the relative power, dps, survivability , etc of a raider has decreased with the elixir change, flasks would become even more powerful and desireable than before.  I think this really has to lead to a pretty significant change to flasks.  Seems to me that they will have to lower the bonuses that flasks give if they want to ballance things out properly, but we'll see how things play out.</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->While current content may not be tuned to support it, I too think it's an excellent idea and something for Blizzard devs to work towards.  In a 10-minute fight, Super Mana Potion is reduced from an average maximum of 100 mana/5 to 20 mana/5.  That's a reasonable but not overpowered gear-gap power gain.  Timers for other combat consumables like protection potions could be moved to a separate timer as well, with a similar use constraint.<br>

Shouldn't you be able to do a weekend flasked-up marathon raid lasting longer than 2 (or the recently suggested 4) hours if you had the means to obtain it?  I don't understand putting a cooldown on the item at all.  Even someone clicking off the flask [while of course moronic] seems like harsh punishment when considering the cooldown.</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->Revisiting old issues here, bear with me.<br>
<br>
The reason for the timer being that long is so that people with the flasks cannot run around the game world constantly flasked.  Permaflasking would lead to the power level disconnection experienced in WoW Classic between raiders and nonraiders, only this time around it would be between people with flasks and people without flasks.<br>
<br>
As for the earlier Jewelcrafting being functionally invalid comment, I suppose it does look like a whole different ballgame from the melee perspective.  From a person who plays a caster and a healer alt, Living Ruby Serpent and Talasite Owl are very alluring trinkets.</div>

<br>
If they'd remove flasks, as some suggest, from the game to satisfy a few of the hard core raiders they'd upset a much larger number of non-raiders who couldn't care less how flasks and consumables "affect" others raiding experience. Many non-raiding alchemists "make a living" from their products and finance their mounts, crafted gear, etc etc.<br>
<br>
Also, there are many more small guilds who lack the Naxx gear and experience they never had a chance to obtain. Why take away some of their toys to feel good and beat some encounter?<br>
<br>
And yes, I do understand your concerns, but many of the suggestions here have a selfish feel to it. Some posts seem to convey a message like "get rid of stuff so we can have an even bigger gap between us and the mere mortals in lesser guilds".<br>
<br>
I know what I am talking about as I have been in both extremes and speak from experience. Before TBC I was raiding Naxx 5-6 nights per week until we hit the Four Horsemen (all other wings clear, so yes, I was there for the Loatheb madness) shortly before TBC release.<br>
<br>
After TBC I changed main (my priest was sick of healthbars) and moved to a very small "casual" guild. We can field one Karazhan group (working on Shade of Aran at the moment), raid 3 nights per week and don't have enough people willing to try Maulgar.<br>
<br>
So I have seen both sides up close and can only say that some of the "demands" and "suggestions" here seem to forget that there are other people around as well.</div>

The very casual of our raiders certainly won't care to make cash for craftables or pamper a profession to create income. They want to log in, raid, learn, have a chance at success, progress and log out after raid time is over. Certainly don't see them shed a tear over alchemy as profession gone from the game, or any other profession for that matter.<br>

Selling trash to vendors is income for them. The people I do know making money of professions I wouldn't call casual.</div>

		<div id="post_message_323670" class="post_message_underline">I would agree there - mine is also a 3 raids a week guild, and we're now in the process of keying up for SSC. our most hard core players are those with all the pots and potions - it's our more time restricted players who are at most risk because of the policy of "flask or die" that seems to be inherent to TBC raids.<br>
<br>
Also Caryna, I have to say, despite what you said - your post comes across as a bit "one sided" as well. No-one is complaining about flasks and potions in Karazhan - I think everyone here would agree that apart from mana potions, that place is perfectly balanced, and being able to use flasks &amp; potions to push over the edge in a fight you are having difficulty with is exactly the sort of situation where they are viable. <br>
 But what happens when your little guild finishes Karazhan and kills Gruul? Because right not, that's *it* in terms of TBc content. End of the wall - you aren't going to be able to pot and flask for every raid post those fights, as you're in the same boat as I am and play to a much lower playtime than the more cutting edge guilds. <br>
<br>
Just because something is balanced in one instance, doesn't neglect the fact that they aren't balanced anywhere else - and sooner or later, you are going to run into the same wall everyone else is hitting and wish that it was fixed. Blizzard can't direct the entirety of TBC content balancing based purely upon one 10 player zone.</div>

		<div id="post_message_323678" class="post_message_underline">Slight derail - my guild too has a mixed level of consumable usage.  We flask our tanks, spot our healers a few Super Mana Potions, and beyond that it's every man for him- or herself.  At a typical raid, we range from a rogue with Relentless Assault, Major Agility, Mastery, Agi food, and Rumsey Rum, to some of the more casual players who only have Stam food and Rumsey Rum.  Of course, a couple of people in the guild are avid cooks and bulk Rumsey Rum  importers, and we don't mind spotting some of the more casual players.  We make public each person's performance after each boss, and it definitely shows who potted out of the ass and who did not.  Some of us are hoping some of the more casual players would step up and would at least pop an Adept's or an Onslaught for a pull, and we hope those players would motivate themselves after assessing their own performance, but we never require it.  <br>
<br>
With that said, I agree using consumables should be a power trip, not a necessity.<br>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->It's a nice argument and all but if you leave them in game, then you are "forcing" the top end of the raiding community to use them whenever engaged in a new encounter. The option is nice, when it's optional.<br>
<br>
Balance is not the issue, as people would still use them to speed through content to allow more time on new content or something similar, the "edge" they give will always be desired one way or another. If flasks and elixirs remain in game, they will continue to be abused by raiding guilds. The extent of abuse will be determined by 1) how large an effect they have and 2) how much effort it takes to farm them. Changing either of these two variables doesn't alter the problem.</div>

Huge stacking consumables are fun in a single player RPG, one where you can hit the Save Game button right before you drink all your various concoctions and rub your various charms and call forth the spirits of your ancestors and then spend a few hours flying around the world smiting evil. <br>
<br>
Not in a game that (evidently) purports to be a competitive endeavor. Who the hell wants to play a game where success is determined by weekly time investment in tedious activities? I'll come right out and say it: Idiots and losers, that's who. Everyone *else* wants this game to be based around execution and, to a lesser extent, a feeling of *permanent* character improvement, and are willing to put up with a reasonable amount of tedium if it lets them engage in the part of the game that they enjoy. A reasonable *and* predictable *and* class-independent level of tedium.<br>
<br>
Blizzard can't design this game around jerks whose life goal is to one-up and guilt-trip their teammates over how much "grind time" they put into a game whose basic structure is already very time-consuming by the standards of anyone with gainful employment or other real-life responsibilities.</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->It's an old argument, and doesn't really work in practice within the current schema of consumables. <br>
<br>
"Brute Forcing" things is not really a design option, because the best of the best will always be willing to do this, thus trivializing content not designed around it. Had SSC and TK not been broken and buggy and tuned around a raid using no consumables, the DnT of the world would have already cleared them weeks or months ago because they would just overpower it all almost every time. The moment you can brute force something is the moment guilds will do it and plow through content, and thus it must be designed around the assumption that you are fully potted. I'm not sure brute forcing can really be an option if you don't want consumable usage to spiral down to the level we are faced with today.  <br>
<br>
Without consumables, or at least very minimal ones, all you are left with is your skill and gear. And that is much easier to balance content around.<br>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->Maybe, but I'd be willing to chalk this up to a lack of knowledge about just how powerful consumables really were. I mean, in many stages of vanilla wow, even the best of us were noobs. Knowledge of game mechanics has increased significantly over time. I think they got away with not balancing encounters around consumables up until the Twin Emps or so simply because people don't realize how powerful they were, for one, and also because of the basic shifting design of boss fights - in MC and BWL, you didn't really have enrage timers, so the pressure wasn't there to optimize DPS at all times, which is where much of the potting issues comes up.</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->It's not clever at all. It's a basic technique of RPG's stretching back dozens of years. Moreover, Blizzard's current system is anything but clever; practically the only thing they've done to make it anything less than completely trivial is (a) have a potion cooldown, and (b) make flasks last through death. Do either of these seem particularly clever to you? <br>
<br>
Players have basically nothing to be proud of if they brute-force an encounter with potions. Why even bother to allow that path, given the consequences? <br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">It's an old argument, and doesn't really work in practice within the current schema of consumables. <br>
<br>
"Brute Forcing" things is not really a design option, because the best of the best will always be willing to do this, thus trivializing content not designed around it. Had SSC and TK not been broken and buggy and tuned around a raid using no consumables, the DnT of the world would have already cleared them weeks or months ago because they would just overpower it all almost every time. The moment you can brute force something is the moment guilds will do it and plow through content, and thus it must be designed around the assumption that you are fully potted. I'm not sure brute forcing can really be an option if you don't want consumable usage to spiral down to the level we are faced with today.  <br>
<br>
Without consumables, or at least very minimal ones, all you are left with is your skill and gear. And that is much easier to balance content around.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>
<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->Is this really an issue, though?<br>
<br>
a) Make technical fights where stats/brute force is less effective<br>
b) When all else fails, don't get overly concerned what the top 0.01% does?<br>
<br>
I mean, I'll give an example... My guild waited for the Gruul nerf before spending any time on him, simply because we did not support the notion of full-raid flasking at all. Another guild on the server had been flasked attempting him for 2 weeks with very little luck. On the day of the nerf, they went in full-flasked and beat him pretty easily for "server first", then talked about how "trivial" it was. <br>
<br>
Our guild went in there 2 days after they did that and killed it the 2nd try without heavy raid-wide consumable or flasks usage due to pretty good execution after practicing the first night, and were perfectly happy with our kill. I didn't much care that another guild felt the need to rely on 3k gold worth of consumables to land a kill, and I don't think many others in my guild did either.<br>
<br>
Somewhere along the line, it almost seems that the design shifted from making fun and challenging raid encounters to simply making well-calculated timesink roadblocks, meant to hinder the population for X amount of days/weeks/hours. I look at the current raids and see a distinct lack of emphasis on "fun" design. Gruul got 10 times more fun IMO when the encounter became possible just to concentration on the execution rather than skimming out every last point of damage from your raid via any means humanly possible.<br>
<br>
I see it as a massive mistake to balance around the worst-case and get -so- concerned about what the max flasked/potted/etc. raids may possibly "trivialize." The problem is assuming that getting flasked/potted is trivial, which we all know it is not. I don't ever remember this being so much of a problem in classic WoW, and I rarely saw widespread abuse of consumables even if raids technically "could" do it.<br>
<br>
Some guilds kill Curator on the first evoc, while I've seen plenty of other Kara groups struggle with even bringing him down before the 10 minute enrage timer. I think we should all be pretty used to the fact that different guilds clear content at different speeds, and honestly I wouldn't be bothered if Nihilum had already cleared out TK/SSC by now due to it being "trivial" for them when raid-flasked and buffed to the max.</div>

I think their testers need to test the "raiding experience" as opposed to simply testing the bosses.  They need to Raid their 4 nights a week and 5 hours per night and farm up all their mats.  They need to be limited to a window of time to do this to simulate the sleep and work required by the playerbase.  This is the experience they need to report back to the developers, not just bosses with the trash despawned and unlimited consumables.</div>

</div>I completely agree, Naxx was a great instance.  That doesn't remove the fact that people did have complaints about the shadow resistance BS for Loatheb and an overall increase in consumables.  Looking back on it knowing what we know now those mat requirements are pretty laughable.  Four Flasks of Titans for Patchwerk on the tanks and maybe a few more fights and a few shadow pots for each person.  <br>
<br>
My point/question was this, if those complaints were out there, warranted or unwarranted, would you as a developer think it was a good idea to completely ramp up the need for mass consumables?  There's a lack of understanding or listening there.</div>

When you use consumables in raids, you should feel powerful, like you have some kind of unintended advantage.   Things should fall over around you.  Why should this happen?  Because as meticulously described over and over, the buffs that pots provide dwarf every gear upgrade you will ever get in a year.  The relative increase in power needs to be appropriately difficult to achieve.  I still remember when our tank first cracked TEN THOUSAND hit points in BWL when he flasked and everyone was like "oooooo".   Bring back the exotique of consumables and make them damn hard to get, then tell the raid designers that pots don't exist.  If hardcore guilds want to continue flasking raids, and devouring new content faster than intended, thats totally fine with me.</div>

</div>Yeah... I am really looking forward to a fight that requires the use of 30g one use pots.  Not sure what Blizzard was thinking with those pots requiring a Primal... maybe in the pre-nerf Elemental Plain, but where the average price for a Primal Fire is 28g according to wowhead (which sounds right), I can't see anyone ever using those... not even tanks.</div>

		<div id="post_message_323164" class="post_message_underline">Well, considering karazhan + gruul/magtheridon are fine without pots/flasks for the majority of the raid, pretty much besides a flask on the MT on most fights at least until SSC the elixir change wont do much. I can't speak much of SSC but it's not like they have to redo completely TBC raid encounters, at most they have to redo 3-4 fights in SSC and maybe some of the yet undefeated bosses in TK. <br>
<br>
What I personally hope for is the additional changes they want to reveal possibly before the end of the week make that a flask takes the spot of offensive elixirs at least. <br>
<br>
I'm kinda hoping for a new flask of supreme power. Pre TBC I was happy their was none, considering blizzard would balance encounters around it, but seeing how the price of non outland herbs has skyrocketed and how annoying it is to go back to the old azeroth and farm herbs on a 100% speed mount I really hope they offer a new alternative for casters, at least mages and shadow priests can use the mana regen one which I think is decent but warlocks have nothing new, 50-70g for a flask of supreme power is really expensive considering that the new flasks have a chance to provide additional ones if a elixir spec alchemist makes it while requiring cheaper herbs to start with!</div>

For one thing, the changes to alchemy don't mean anything unless flasks are somehow included in the notes... even then, does 500 armor for your MT break an encounter for you?  They just missed the nail badly on this one... massive disconnect between decision makers and the flower pickers on the ground (I mean raiders).</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Alchemy changes actually make things worse.  I knew they'd fuck it up.  The problem is people who work at blizzard and make these decisions are probably not spending hours a day farming for the mats for potions in a raid.  And the QA people almost guaranteed are not doing it.  <br>
<br>
This post sums it up best:<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
So we can still flask our raid, and thats considered a fix?  Stupid.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>Not only that, you need to farm for more mats for the 4 new elixirs that will most likely be needed depending on the encounter! So, we will actually have an increase to the amount of time farming and our mats will be spread out over more pots. This is two steps backwards - we didn't need new pots to waste our time on......and to waste more spots in our inventory with since they don't stack past 5. Think about it - load up on pots for SSC or TK and realize you need pot A for fight 1, pot B for fight 2, etc. I have to admit, I'm not surprised they didn't understand what our complaint was and then initiate a fix that made things even worse.<br>
<br>
Bottom line to WoW endgame: You still can't raid if you are not an herber with 3-6 hours a free time per week spent flying in circles. Who put Dogbert in charge of WoW?</div>

</div>50-70g for supreme power is quite reasonable.  Most of the new flasks go for 10-20g more than that.  (Fort is at 110 on my server.)  And I can think of very few situations where it would benefit a mage to forsake 150+dmg in favor of 70 mana/5, much less a shadowpriest who would see almost half that in increased mana return from VT.<br>

</div>Whether competent healerss can get by (i.e. keep the raid alive) without flasking or not, you're not going to find DPS that do the same DPS without flasks as with. So when the push comes to kill something ASAP, people will want to flask DPS. And with encounters as they currently are, that push comes more often than it ever used to, since bleeding-edge gear 4 months into TBC is not much butter than bleeding-edge gear 4 weeks into TBC.</div>

</div>The idea is fine. It just cant stand alone.<br>
Flask power needs to be reduced.<br>
Guess its still an open question whether or not flasks counts as elixirs in this new change, but it doesnt matter much here. If nothing else is changed flasks will be required for "everything".<br>
What was best would really be, 1 elixir or flask (or maybe 2 elixirs OR one flask, if such a system was possible). Flask power nerfed. For wipe nights a flask might be cheaper and more powerful. For farming, the elixir would be cheaper, but also slightly less powerful.<br>
<br>
All in all, the only real reason to go for a flask instead of elixir would be for the "last through death".<br>
<br>
On top of that a longer cd on potions would be really good, but I guess such a change could still come too.</div>

		<div id="post_message_323563" class="post_message_underline" style="min-height: 183px;">Alot needs to be fixed. <br>
<br>
Right now, in order to raid, you have to pot up for several encounters. You could argue that you don't "Have" to. But its moot, because it behooves you NOT to pot up. Alot of boss's while having "neat" abilities are still poorly designed around the --Enrage Timer--. Im sorry but i fucking hate this mechanic. Its like you see dev's sitting around the room at thier table trying to think of a way to make a boss harder, and there is like this 1 guy at the end of the table who's sole job is to say "Lets add a Enrage timer to it!". He prolly makes 40k a year. <br>
<br>
Hydross (the real way) i mean if your guild does this the real way and wins, do you HONESTLY need a 10minute or your fucking boned timer? How many guilds use the pure Nature phase now??? I know we do, it saves us time, potions, flasks and headache's. I know Blindelf and Snake-man have 10min enrage timers. We first started seeing these timers i think in AQ40. To put an end to guilds dinking away at bosses till they died. Im just curious, but if you fixed Hydross to where you have to do switchs' and removed the 10 minute timer, would he still not be difficult? Hell im sure he'd still kick a good 2/3rds of Wow's entire player population.<br>
<br>
Blizz has proven that they can make unique encounters that are challanging that dont require a time limit. Sometimes i can live with a Enrage Timer but it shouldn't become the Norm to force a wipe after a certain period of time. Take for example, Gruul, Vael and a few others i can't think of because its 5am. <br>
<br>
Back on the Consumable fix. I am not sure its going to actually fix anything. I dunno, i personally have gotten to the point where i truely hate farming and making pots, so i can raid during the week. Part of me enjoys the boost i get from consumables during the raid, the other part of me wish's every boss was Garr.<br>

</div>Doing that for a tank was once a point of pride and a sign of guild/raid solidarity.  At that point in time it was palatable.<br>
<br>
Flasking for everyone is just an insult.<br>
<br>
Edit: it was funny when the guild alchemist (and not even an official position) would hand me Gifts of Arthas to "use" for Golemagg.  Now it's expected for the guild bank to hand me a flask just so we wouldn't risk wiping on a 10man boss.</div>

		<div id="post_message_323575" class="post_message_underline">Enrage timers are certainly overused. I don't mind them when they're a non-issue unless things begin to go wrong - I liked Hakkar's enrage for example (I was a little late to the raiding scene so that's not as long ago as it is for most of you) but you sure didn't need consumables to beat it. It only became a factor if you were badly undergeared or if you let him heal too much.<br>
<br>
The enrage timer should be used sparingly. There are other options - Ragnaros for instance doesn't have an enrage but I don't think any guilds opted to outlast him - the Sons phase was so taxing that you didn't want to see two of them, but if Rags submerged at 5% or less you could try and scrape through a second one to finish him off. Another way to prevent healer-stacking is to give the boss some ability that while avoidable has a good chance of mucking up everything. Prince Malchezaar (at least for us) is like this - sit out on that terrace for too long and bad infernals will happen.<br>
<br>
Scrap flasks, allow us to take one mana potion per combat (cooldown doesn't expire until combat breaks), and heavily restrict elixirs (one of any type per character, lasts through death sounds good to me). Since a huge part of healer longevity comes from consumables you'll have solved a portion of yourneed for an enrage timer just by restricting consumables. Healers can no longer heal forever and the prospect of oom looms once more. Then throw in adds that must be controlled, adds that must be DPSed down before they do something bad, or some clever "you-don't-want-this-fight-to-go-on-forever" mechanic to prevent stacking a raid with healers and you're fine.<br>
<br>
I'd be completely happy if the only consumable allowed in a raid instance was a heavy netherweave bandage. I much prefer measures of "preparedness" that only have to be done once - resist gear is okay with me. Chain-potting is not (and my guild hasn't even reached the point where flasking beyond the MT is necessary).</div>

		<div id="post_message_323584" class="post_message_underline">A funny thought that just came to me.<br>
<br>
Isn't alchemy the only profession where the real high-level goodies of the profession are not BoP? Seems with the recent move to BoP high end BS, tailoring, leatherworking and engineering (soon more). Jewelcrafting shows that by trinkets and figurines going BoP at all levels there seems to be a move to make at least part of the profession personal utility only (the way engineering feels probably a tad too much).<br>
<br>
How would herbalism feel if flasks and top end elixirs were BoP, ala JC consumable figurines? It's an interesting thought because if that would kill all other professions it's kind of clear how out of tune the profession is with the rest.<br>

The only profession alt I'm currently pampering is my alchemist for obvious reasons. Virtually anything my alchemist produces has broad utility and a persistent market.</div>

</div>While current content may not be tuned to support it, I too think it's an excellent idea and something for Blizzard devs to work towards.  In a 10-minute fight, Super Mana Potion is reduced from an average maximum of 100 mana/5 to 20 mana/5.  That's a reasonable but not overpowered gear-gap power gain.  Timers for other combat consumables like protection potions could be moved to a separate timer as well, with a similar use constraint.<br>
<br>
One obvious scenario that needs to be considered if such a change were to occur is a hunter's ability to feign death to get out of combat.</div>

Shouldn't you be able to do a weekend flasked-up marathon raid lasting longer than 2 (or the recently suggested 4) hours if you had the means to obtain it?  I don't understand putting a cooldown on the item at all.  Even someone clicking off the flask [while of course moronic] seems like harsh punishment when considering the cooldown.</div>

</div>Revisiting old issues here, bear with me.<br>
<br>
The reason for the timer being that long is so that people with the flasks cannot run around the game world constantly flasked.  Permaflasking would lead to the power level disconnection experienced in WoW Classic between raiders and nonraiders, only this time around it would be between people with flasks and people without flasks.<br>
<br>
As for the earlier Jewelcrafting being functionally invalid comment, I suppose it does look like a whole different ballgame from the melee perspective.  From a person who plays a caster and a healer alt, Living Ruby Serpent and Talasite Owl are very alluring trinkets.</div>

</div>So youre telling me that the DnTs and Nihilums of this world should be the design goal of WoW Raiding?<br>

And as for designing around full potted raids.<br>

Did you progress through AQ full potted?<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">It's an old argument, and doesn't really work in practice within the current schema of consumables. <br>
<br>
"Brute Forcing" things is not really a design option, because the best of the best will always be willing to do this, thus trivializing content not designed around it. Had SSC and TK not been broken and buggy and tuned around a raid using no consumables, the DnT of the world would have already cleared them weeks or months ago because they would just overpower it all almost every time. The moment you can brute force something is the moment guilds will do it and plow through content, and thus it must be designed around the assumption that you are fully potted. I'm not sure brute forcing can really be an option if you don't want consumable usage to spiral down to the level we are faced with today.  <br>
<br>
Without consumables, or at least very minimal ones, all you are left with is your skill and gear. And that is much easier to balance content around.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>Is this really an issue, though?<br>
<br>
a) Make technical fights where stats/brute force is less effective<br>
b) When all else fails, don't get overly concerned what the top 0.01% does?<br>
<br>
I mean, I'll give an example... My guild waited for the Gruul nerf before spending any time on him, simply because we did not support the notion of full-raid flasking at all. Another guild on the server had been flasked attempting him for 2 weeks with very little luck. On the day of the nerf, they went in full-flasked and beat him pretty easily for "server first", then talked about how "trivial" it was. <br>
<br>
Our guild went in there 2 days after they did that and killed it the 2nd try without heavy raid-wide consumable or flasks usage due to pretty good execution after practicing the first night, and were perfectly happy with our kill. I didn't much care that another guild felt the need to rely on 3k gold worth of consumables to land a kill, and I don't think many others in my guild did either.<br>
<br>
Somewhere along the line, it almost seems that the design shifted from making fun and challenging raid encounters to simply making well-calculated timesink roadblocks, meant to hinder the population for X amount of days/weeks/hours. I look at the current raids and see a distinct lack of emphasis on "fun" design. Gruul got 10 times more fun IMO when the encounter became possible just to concentration on the execution rather than skimming out every last point of damage from your raid via any means humanly possible.<br>
<br>
I see it as a massive mistake to balance around the worst-case and get -so- concerned about what the max flasked/potted/etc. raids may possibly "trivialize." The problem is assuming that getting flasked/potted is trivial, which we all know it is not. I don't ever remember this being so much of a problem in classic WoW, and I rarely saw widespread abuse of consumables even if raids technically "could" do it.<br>
<br>
Some guilds kill Curator on the first evoc, while I've seen plenty of other Kara groups struggle with even bringing him down before the 10 minute enrage timer. I think we should all be pretty used to the fact that different guilds clear content at different speeds, and honestly I wouldn't be bothered if Nihilum had already cleared out TK/SSC by now due to it being "trivial" for them when raid-flasked and buffed to the max.</div>

</div>I'm pretty low on whiskey... you lazy flasker!!<br>
<br>
I always thought the purpose of consumables wasn't to pot and flask up every encounter (titans for tanks excluded), but to let guilds practice encounters until the execution was perfect and then pot up to beat the encounter. If Blizzard tested encounters with no consumables first then with full consumables, I think they would have a much better idea of how to tune encounters and consumables.<br>
<br>
Just like the vast majority of WoW 1.0, encounters should be doable without any consumables. Hopefully the new consumable nerfs will but things back to this state.</div>

		<div id="post_message_323771" class="post_message_underline">The design goal should be to put pots in the hands of the casuals, not the hardcore.  This is obviously flipped from the current situation.<br>
<br>
If blizzard can find something that prevents hardcore people from using pots, then everyone wins.  Encounters are tuned for <br>
1.  Min-max players with great strategy and execution with no buffs<br>
-or-<br>
2.  "Average" players with decent strategy and execution, potted up for an extra tier of gear.  <br>
So at any raid that is failing, you as a player feel that you have the OPTION to a) step it up, figure out how to improve your numbers, respec harder pve, pay more attention or b) go farm some pots.  <br>
<br>
The tricky question is of course, how do we prevent the hardcores from using pots?  My humble suggestion: Heroic raids.  Bosses tuned the same as normal, but no consumables allowed at all (arena rules) ... and better loot or more loot.  People can "experience new content" potted up on EZ-mode, then once they understand the fights, go back without the training wheels to earn the real shiny purple loot.  The tuning is key.  A normal-mode raid for a hardcore guild should be EASY for them if they pot.  <br>
<br>
I really do think heroic instances as a concept are an outstanding addition to the game but I think the implementation of them leaves a lot of room for improvement, but thats a separate thread.</div>

</div>The difference really is that Blizzard apparently doesn't like the potential for their content being trivialized. Because of that, they have to design with consumables in mind, otherwise the potential is there that their beautifully balanced content for a raid using no consumables gets ripped to shreds very easily with the use of consumables.<br>
<br>
There's a few ways of dealing with it for Blizzard, the designers will most likely want to keep the encounters challenging in all cases for a guild that's expected to do it, so making changes to consumables is a logical choice; if you can stack less consumables, the amount of difference they make is also logically smaller, allowing for a more natural progression of consumable usage versus gear levels. Currently the amount of consumables as well as the level of the gear upgrades (Or lack thereof as some would say) basically means that it'll take a very, very long time before someone gets into the 'Consumables are optional' part of doing any of the later raid encounters.<br>
<br>
Of course, lowering the impact of consumables might also mean that Blizzard can balance encounters better along people simply never using consumables, assuming guilds have spent the time doing the previous content. That way consumables turn into something trail-blazing guilds will be using, while more casual guilds that take more time gearing up will also have less need for using them.<br>
<br>
The issue in general really is simply within the power of consumables... Though I'll add that unless more is revealed the hammer is missing the nail quite a bit, while it's annoying to have to use a lot of individual elixirs, a lot of the power of consumables really lies within the 2 minute cooldown potions.<br>
<br>
<i>Edit:</i> I'm trying to look at it from a designer's point of view; personally I wouldn't mind consumables being kept as they are as long as content gets retuned to not needing them. But I don't see that as being as attractive an option for a designer as it is for a player.</div>

Did you flask your whole raid in MC/BWL/AQ or Naxx?<br>
At that time the pots gave no lesser adge than they do now.<br>
Cost was a very effective way to prevent that happening. As long as potting was not really *needed* it was purely optional. Proof for this lies in the history of the raiding game.<br>
(Correct me if Im wrong, but Drama flasking the whole raid for Nef Firstkill was a grave exception ... world firsts usually follow entirely different rules)</div>

</div>The raid endgame changed quite a bit from the Molten Core days, to BWL, to AQ40, to Naxx. The encounters have gradually gotten more complex, and the margin for error has gradually decreased, and the raiding player base has become more and more competitive amongst itself as the game has matured. Over the last 2+ years the raider player-base has become better at the game in general, and Blizzard has responded by creating more and more challenging encounters. At this point any edge that is reasonably available and offers a significant advantage to raiders will be used, whether it's a mod or a consumable.<br>
<br>
The problem from Blizzard's perspective, with making the current encounters easier (so people don't feel compelled to use consumables) is that of course at this point many guilds would tear through most of the content, and probably use consumables anyway to absolutely trivialize encounters.</div>

Theoretically, what difference does it make between the new alchemy and old alchemy if you are going to flask up the raid anyway? <br>
<br>
You saved the 100(20*5) elixirs that you are going to throw in.<br>
<br>

They are introducing new Elixirs, most likely there will be fights that are balanced around the buff they give you. On these fights you will most likley kill the Flask and use 2x Elixirs instead. This means even more farming when you think it out. You will need to farm for all the new elixirs as well as the flasks....both will be required no matter what as we know officially know that every enounter is balanced around flowers and not skill. They are tuning fights around a profession that most people will not pick up instead of skill and gear obtained through normal progression....doesn't that seem just dumb to most? Why is Alchemy/Herb considered an optional profession when EVERYONE that wants to make progress needs to have them.  Why isn't this the same for the other professions? Why are professions more important than how well your raid plays together since all the skill in the world won't make up the major gains you pick up via pots/flasks/elixirs.<br>
<br>
I think Quigon has a very valid argument.</div>

		<div id="post_message_324345" class="post_message_underline">There's a lot of overreaction going on here. I hate flasks with a passion, but Blizz isn't too far off from where they should be in terms of the new elixirs/flasks. They just need to reduce the power and cost values of flasks by about 1/3 so the benefit of using a flask over two elixirs is mostly relegated to the fact that flasks don't disappear on death.<br>
<br>
The problems with TBC raiding aren't just with consumables. It is a combination of consumables, overtuning, and lack of gear progression. The consumables issue only mask the other two issues. A lot of the complaining about the new consumables are mostly due to problems with roots in the other two issues, and you are just looking at the consumable changes in the vacuum assuming that nothing else is addressed. Even if they put a bullet to the head of flasks, overtuning and shitty gear would still mean a shitty raid game. Just a less time consuming shitty raid game.<br>
<br>
Bringing it back to the sanity of the earlier game where potting all the way up is only necessary to try to eek out a first kill if you are a bit undergeared or underskilled requires making encounters tuned towards that, and a consumable spread small enough that they can achieve it without trivialization. This elixir change brings it a lot closer to the reasonable spread to facitate proper tuning. They just need to follow through with the other aspects, of which they are at least are aware.</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->Look at it from this view: Once they tune the encounters, remove the bugs and increase gar rewards you are still stuck with this 'fix' for alchemy. The fix being that it is still 100% required for you to progress. They didn't solve anything and we still have the other two issues.....so a lot are skeptical at how well those fixes will be.<br>
<br>
Just an FYI on my perspective to this. I was every at every 'first' kill for my guild from BWL up to KT. I was there for a world first and was on many top 5/10 kills on the rest of Naxx. However since I do not have any time to farm for consumables nor farm for the gold to pay for them.....I am no longer raiding. I don't even try to make it home in time for the raids since I would be the only one there without consumables. So, TBC raiding has been almost non existent to me simply because of fucking virtual flowers (and that pesky anti-melee thing didn't help either). I get to watch my guild progress from the sidelines now.</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->I think it's undeniably a step in the right direction.  They are lessening the number of consumables it's possible to use and tuning encounters for fewer consumable usage than they are currently.<br>
<br>
Whether it's sufficient or not is arguable, and really it comes down to what they mean by "balancing to take into account the use of a single flask".  Does that mean that the fights are going to effectively require a flask?  Or does it mean that a flask will help when you're undergeared, but you'll be able to farm a boss flaskless with a few gear upgrades and the clean execution that comes with practice?<br>
<br>
Admittedly, a single flask is still more powerful than a tier or two of gear upgrades, but coupled with just plain getting better at fights, I can see bosses being tuned to the point where skilled players don't need a flask at all, ever.  Given Blizzard's track record I'm not putting money on that, but based on what they've said, it's entirely possible.  Assuming that the single comment that's been made with respect to flask usage means the absolute worst case of "every boss will require every raider to use a flask every time" seems a little excessive.</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->Don't mistake 'glad this isn't an even stupider decision than it is' for contentedness. There are still a laundry list of problems involved with consumables in raids but without knowing what Blizzard's definition of 'tuned' is (which seems to vary in every single instance they put out) or seeing any other changes to the recipes in 2.1 it's hard to know exactly where things are going to go, other than "Not Away From Removing Chain Chugging Mana Potions" which matters a hell of a lot more than the number of elixirs on your DPS. This isn't a solution and I don't think that's a secret to anybody. I'm still not going to farm for potions other than PVP pots on my free nights and this change makes it slightly easier for me, but that doesn't mean I'm ecstatically overjoyed that I <b>only</b> would have to flask and chain chug mana pots.</div>

Consumables should be used if you're struggling to do a fight and you need that extra little pick-me-up to make up for what you might lack in skill/gear, but subsequent kills of a boss should be absolutely doable without the need of them.</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->I don't think enough people realize this.  If this change goes through without people kicking and screaming over how terrible it is, consumables will probably stay this way forever.  Meaning that in order to progress in raiding, everyone is going to need multiple flasks per week.  This is barely better than what currently exists, and I believe that people seeing this "solution" will just quit raiding entirely.<br>
<br>
How Blizzard can have pvp on one hand, with it's amazing reward structure (which incidentally gears your entire team in parallel), no gold sinks (one time charter fee of 20-40g per person is  cheap).  Then on the other side we have.... raiding, and this absurd risk/reward system even before we take into account consumables.  Add in consumables, time, organization, repair costs, resist gear, etc etc, and it is a little absurd how these two systems are supposed to be "equal".<br>
<br>
Blizzard used to have a motto: "Is this fun?".  Personally, I miss that Blizzard sorely, because raiding is NOT fun, and it is why I've turned most of my attention to arena pvp.</div>

		<div id="post_message_324360" class="post_message_underline">I really wish content was tested with squibs, zero profession characters with no talents spent, geared only in gear that dropped in the preceeding zone.<br>
<br>
I want to raid content so that I can raid more content so that I can raid more content.  Nowhere in that mainstream line of pve progression is there a stop at the pinecone palace of potions.<br>
<br>
I'm in favor of any change to raiding that makes it realistic for a group with zero professions and zero talents and a whole lot of skill and persistance to overcome the cutting edge content at the peak of the game.  This probably means that raiding needs a meaningful gear progression.  This probably means that with regards to consumables they are either nerfed into oblivion in relation to said gear progression, a stat cap is imposed, or they are stripped at the zone in.  As I find stat caps to be boring, and nerfing outdoor activities to also be boring, I favor stripping the consumables at the door.<br>
<br>
Personally, I feel that farming terrocone is a direct progression from PVPSandLOL and should probably be an important factor in world pvp/pve.  Let world pvp fight over resource nodes, and be influenced by full out flask/elixir abuse, and there's a niche for the crazy alchemical potions.  It's even one that gives those zany alchemists a real alchemical benefit.  Hell, give the person who mines the most sand/dreamfoil/etc a shot at bonus herbalism recipes from the darkmoon faire while you're at it.<br>
<br>
I'm completely ok with leaving alchemy in the game for people that really enjoy running around staring at their minimap, but I am not ok with basing my progression - the progression for people who enjoy killing dragons in organized groups, to be tied to running around staring at the minimap.<br>
<br>
Bandaids, maybe a baked egg and a health pot or 3, that's the most consumables I ever want (and I'd be pissed about bandaids if first aid were not a "free" profession for all characters)</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->  Personally I'm not even sure why this is reegarded as acceptable.  Certianly it's not overly taxing, but it doesn't add anything to the game.  Why do I even have to describe it as, "not too bad"?  If it's not "good" why is it even in the game.<br>
<br>
Alchemists and Herbalists are people too, and They want a useful and productive tradeskill.  But that shouldn't be carried on backs of other players and their enjoyment.  <br>
<br>
Too expand slighty, my guild raids a lot, nearly everyday.  We can regularly kill Gruul, and are probably starting Mag this week.  Consumables help us beat things that we struggle on, undoubtedly.  But, I would much, much, much rather wipe for days on a boss perfecting it in a consumable free environment, then wipe even once, when every death means I have added to my mindless farming requirements.  (Flasks are still stupid, even if they do last through death.)<br>
<br>
Wow is supposed to be a fun, and enjoyable hobby, and raiding should be a viable part of that.  Requiring me to invest a certian ammount of effort in gear and stuff one time is fine.  Having to do it before every raid is beyong unbearable.  And makes my inarticulate with anger and disapointment.</div>

		<div id="post_message_324364" class="post_message_underline" style="min-height: 183px;">A little background info before the rest of my post. I've been an alchemist since beta. Pre-TBC I had every recipe for months, and I will have every recipe again very soon(I've discovered 4 of the 5 discovery recipes). I'm an elixir spec alchemist with almost every recipe in the game, and as such I make literally <i>thousands</i> of potions/elixirs every week for my guildmates and various other people on my server. I'm probably as hardcore about alchemy as anyone there is.<br>
<br>
This shit needs to change, and I would not oppose huge nerfs to specific elements of alchemy.<br>
<br>
Elixirs and flasks are the problem with alchemy and need to go or be nerfed significantly. They require no skill to use or obtain whatsoever, and they are overpowered. Alchemy should be about <i>potions</i>, not elixirs. Potions do require an amount of skill(however small it may be) to use properly, just as any class ability would. It's an extra ability for you to use and keep track of, that is limited by a cooldown. This is what alchemy should be about.<br>
<br>
View alchemy as a 'buffet' of new class abilities that all share a 2 minute cooldown. Give us more options, and make sure they're options that reward intelligence and skill. Give us potions that we have to use reactively, and make all potions easier to obtain. The alchemy specializations were a step in the right direction. After you've given us a bunch of cool <u>potions</u>, give us a few more with slightly superior effects and make them BoP. That can be our version of ring enchants.<br>
<br>
This elixir shit has got to go. It is not fun. It's retarded. Change it.</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->At this point, for me, "acceptable" would be back to the MC/BWL days.  Bring a stack or two of health pots, and enough bandages to last the night.  Back when MC was new (to me) the Rogues had many DPS competitions which resulted in some rogues coming in with Songflower Serenade, Mongoose pots, and an Onyxia buff every possible raid.  It was novel for about 1-2 months before I said "screw it" and depended on my own gear and skill to stay at/near top.<br>
<br>
The more I think about it, the more absurd it seems to me that I'm now numb to throwing two elixirs up for random boss X, repeating the same mistakes as in my early raiding days.<br>

		<div id="post_message_324367" class="post_message_underline">Despite raid encounters being tuned for consumable usage(and they have been), my guild has been able to progress just fine with moderate usage of consumables.  Everyone flasked for the world first c'thun kill; our first c'thun kill had probably 3/4th of the raid flasked, and I'd be willing to bet that's on the only time in a raid we had more than 5-6 people flasked.  It just took us much longer to learn the fight than Nihilum, of course, but we got it eventually, and with less consumables and less overall skill.  <br>
<br>
As bekah noted earlier in the thread, I wouldn't want consumables eliminated; it allows me to flask, so that a casual player in my guild who isn't as skilled as I am doesn't get me killed when he chains a green eye beam or a shatter(or to make up for his lackluster dps).  We're not going to kick someone out because they aren't doing well on a fight, we always aim to help them progress, which sometimes can be more painful than clicking herbs now and then.  Keeping this in mind:<br>
<br>
1) Alchemy is ideally a "patch" for gear progression, lack of player skill/group cohesion, and plain old "getting over the hump" it takes to get a boss on farm sometimes.  This should not change, and I'd argue it currently serves exactly this purpose for less-than-hardcore guilds.<br>
<br>
2) Because it's available, guilds wanting to be world firsts are going to use it to maximum effect.  This should be expected.<br>
<br>
3) Recently, due to the lack of decent itemization increases and the relative power of consumables to gear, consumables make up a larger part of the numbers game than "how many times have we farmed bosses before this."  As a result, content seems overtuned.<br>
<br>
4) Blizzard's solution seems to be slowly buffing itemization(so they say) and limiting the top end of what alchemy can do.<br>
<br>
Nothing seems unreasonable to me.  Just because they say "We keep in mind that every player could be flasked and balance accordingly" does not mean "You must flask to progress."</div>

</div>
<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->However, those issues relate directly to consumable usage. Suppose the spread of consumable usage is 'small enough' such that it is possible to make encounters that potting up can give you an edge but isn't required for advancement unless you are undergeared. Then the the difference between being forced to use consumables to win or not is a matter of tuning.<br>
<br>
The current issue of being forced to pot up on farm content is caused not just by overpowered consumables, but overtuning so that you need to go all out to win and lack of gear progression such that you cannot advance past the consumables. <br>
<br>
Take hydross for an example. He requires a good amount of coordination, but he also requires very high amounts of dps (or healing/tanking if you do the 250% nature trick) to beat the enrage timer. However, if he was retuned such that his enrage timer was say, 15 minutes, then he would still require coordination and skill, but you wouldn't have to fully pot to down him before he instagibs the raid. And if he dropped good upgrades then the amount of potting you have to do goes a lot faster over time.<br>
<br>
The way they have to solve the issue is not just by weakening consumables (which is a necessary component), but downtuning the 'bigger numbers' aspects of the fights so you don't absolutely need them.</div>

<br>
Totals: 334 dmg, 24 crit, 28 mp5, 30 spell pen, 33 int, 53 spirit, 15 sta<br>
<br>
Now, I doubt anyone would do that... but... anyone technically -could- do that. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Their new Testing ProtoMage will have on:<br>
Flask of Supreme Power (150 dmg)<br>
Superior Wizard Oil (42 dmg)<br>
Basilisk Food (23 dmg/20 spirit)<br>
Totals: 215 dmg, 20 spirit<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
So not only does it hardcap the amount of consumables you *can* use, it means encounters will require you to "cap" yourself with consumables less because they expect you to be getting about 1/2 as much benefit from consumables as they currently do.</div>

</div>Yes, raid encounters will all be designed on a raid being Fully Flasked.  Still misses the point entirely that people want BWL or AQ40 back.<br>
<br>
You know what buffing myself for AQ40 used to mean?  Mageblood + Mongoose + Winter Squid/Nightfin.  Throw in some Mana Pots and it was good to go, Cost of raiding a night?  About 20g and only on bosses not on farm or Cthun.</div>

</div>Moving fast but i'll risk it.  Praetorian, why shouldn't I just pop Flask of the Titans instead?  It's equivalent to 120 stamina and I don't recall Titans not stacking with PW:F.<br>
<br>
I can see it being done to lower the cost of farm status content, perhaps.<br>
<br>
My personal thought was on the possibility of +resist elixirs that stack with resist auras/motw.</div>

I read that as "even more shit to farm for" because you will be farming some content during the week and some new content and will most likely need the flask and elixir. I also don't see a solution to resolving the issue that if you don't have an herber at your disposal you most likely can't raid new content. <br>
<br>
We asked for changes that would require less consumable stacking so you could spend more time playing the game instead of flying around in circles looking for yellow dots on your minimap. I don't really see a hint of that in the preview given to us. The massive gain from pots and consumables are still there and will still be required to perform.</div>

</div>Heh. The secondary effects on mana pot consumption are also potentially tragic. With fewer DPS buffs available, one would expect encounters to last somewhat longer, which implies that healers will use more mana, which means the obvious.</div>

</div>Yeah I was certainly hoping they'd address the issue of mana pots providing 100 mp5--effectively doubling my mana regen otherwise.<br>
<br>
These changes are good I guess if you consider 1 Flask or 2 elixirs vs 1 Flask + 4 elixirs previously.<br>
<br>
I am disappointed that they didn't make any changes to the flask herb requirements or charges per use that would reduce the farming strain in that regard. Looking forward I wouldn't see it being unheard of to go through 5+ Flask of Supreme Powers in a week and I imagine tanks using more.<br>
<br>
Yes the system will be better, but when you started with a system that was astronomically bad it still might not be enough. I think we need to see the itemization/trash changes. I think people would be more eager to flask up if the loot they were getting was the <b>best</b> in the game.</div>

		<div id="post_message_324038" class="post_message_underline">Slight derailment: what is everyone's feeling on the lack of TBC replacement for Night Dragon's Breath and Whipper Root Tuber? I've heard that healers are hurting for old world Demonic/Dark Runes, but what about the two consumables people used to scour for in Felwood, sometimes in full groups so everyone can get some on the same timer?<br>
<br>
On one hand, an upgrade to Night Dragon's Breath would ease up the current, nigh exclusive reliance on Super Mana Potions and/or Fel Mana Potions as the healer consumable of choice.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, "it's just more shit to farm for."<br>
<br>
Another somewhat more random thought:<br>
<br>
Mana Thistle restores mana upon picking.  Wouldn't it be simply fantastic to have a long boss fight where people have to rely on picking herbs that spawn during the fight for longevity? You'd get to keep the herbs of course. </div>

</div>Of course not, a flask is a big bang-for-your-buck consumable.  But, there are situations where I am not always going to be flasking, yet will probably pot up just to be safe (considering the fact that gear advancement doesn't look like it will be enough).<br>

</div>She's fudging her numbers, you'd have to be pretty masochistic to want to stack that may pots to down an encounter for the first time (i.e, wipe night):<br>
<br>
Flask of Supreme Power (150 dmg)<br>
Superior Wizard Oil (42 dmg)<br>
Basilisk Food (23 dmg + 20 spirit)  <b>(no changes for these three)</b><br>
<br>
so:<br>
Adept's Elixir (24 dmg/crit)<br>
Elixir of Major Firepower (60 dmg)<br>
<b>*Greater Arcane Elixir (35 dmg)</b> <b>(only adds 11 damage w/adepts)</b><br>
Elixir of Mastery (15 all stats)<br>
<b>*Elixir of the Sages (18 int/spirit)</b><b> (Only adds 3 SPI/INT w/Mastery)</b><br>
<b>*Elixir of Empowerment (30 spell penetration)</b> <b>(Adds nothing Vs. majority of NPCs)</b><br>
Elixir of Major Mageblood (16 mp5)<br>
Mageblood Potion (12 mp5)<br>
<br>
I'll point out that the current DPS gods, sPreists and warlocks, probably skip last two pots as well.  I'll miss my 80 damage and my one crit, but she's got a strawman on her hands there.</div>

Flasks... remove them.<br>
Elixirs.. if you're popping more than 2 consumables per attempt, something is horribly wrong.  <br>

But all of the fixes here overlook a fix that is: <br>

<br>
And that fix is: <br>
<b>Make Flasks and Elixir's not stack with player buffs.</b>  The entire problem is fixed.

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->I'm 1 hop from a blizzard dev  and its not going to happen.  The game is not designed by committee or suggestion box, the lead designers have some very strong philosophies and ideas that carry through the entire game.<br>
<br>
The simple flaw in your idea is that it doesn't allow Blizzard to design end-level bosses (Kael, Vashj, BT wing bosses, etc) with consumables in mind.  Yes, many are also skill based fights but many will also be farm-based (resist gear, consumables, itemization).  No one is going to run a 25 man raid without a few priests, pallies, mages, druids, etc to give the baseline buffs so its kind of silly to say "well... flask is there in case you don't have a pally!".  Flasks/elixirs should be there in case your players aren't 100% PVE spec, good, geared, and class-comp balanced.<br>
<br>
I think people are way over-reacting to these changes.  I saw a demo of 2.1.0 internal build earlier this week, SSC and TK are tuned to be a lot better.  My WoW sub is currently cancelled because I have no desire to spend more time farming herbs than raiding, from what I saw I'll probably renew my sub when 2.1.0 hits.  BT and Hyjal are beautifully done and definitely have more the Naxx style of raid design than the shit that is SSC (ok the bosses are decent but the trash is obnoxious).  IMO this is really a good time to check out LOTRo free, have fun with its lore, etc and then come back to WoW in 1-2 months when 2.1 hits.  I really have no idea why anyone would subjucate themselves to SSC right now other than perhaps some S&amp;M rp guild.</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->Unless they change their stance and make it so that Flasks are not a requirement for each person to raid, there will be a problem.  I said it before and I will say it again.<br>
<br>
Lets say a boss is tuned thinking everyone is going to be Flasked and it can truly only be beaten by a Flasked raid.  360 AP/1500 HP/70 Mp5/150 Spell Damage is not made up for in one tier of gear.  If you can barely beat an encounter in full flasks, you will have to continue to Flask until you get past the gear that boss is dropping and into the next tier.<br>
<br>
Flasks on months old content = Stupid.<br>
<br>
Also, all this does is create a requirement to raid.  Why not implement a change where to zone into any 25 man raid instance, people must use a consumable item only created by Leatherworking?  It would be the exact same principle.<br>
<br>
Requiring consumables is stupid and a time sink.  Its not even an enjoyable time sink unless you are very Masochistic.<br>
<br>
Unless you can come in here and tell me, an entire raid will be able to get by with the MT flasked and everyone using 2 elixirs, I will not be satisfied and I am pretty sure others will not be as well.</div>

The idea behind this change seems to be reducing the absolute power gain that a raid can achieve from consumable use.  I suppose that my question/concern is the same as that expressed in other places:<br>
<br>
The flasks are just too damn powerful.<br>
<br>
So my suggestion was more about toning down their effects (take them from +20% power gain to 5%).<br>
<br>
Essentially - consumables getting tuned down or gear getting tuned up (or both) is fine.<br>
<br>
I don't mind a touch of farming - and I admit that I like being able to buff my character - I can't imagine farming up 6+ flasks a week for each person.  And if that's what this change means - it fails utterly.</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->But Flasks and elixirs are not the only problem either.  Potions are going to be a pain in the ass.  What is the average for Super Mana Potions right now?  About 10g per stack of 5?  I think they sell for even higher then that on my server.  Healers are required to chain chug these things.  Hunters like to even go for the Fel Mana Potions which are even more expensive.<br>
<br>
But lets not forget these little magical things called Ironshield Potions...according to Wowhead, 10g is the average AH price for 1.  Imagine any encounter where the tank is required to chain chug these a la Patchwerk.<br>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->Well this is exactly the idea they are going off of: testing with teh assumption every raid member is using a flask (even after the alchemy changes).<br>
<br>
EDIT: @ Grogzor: Mana potions per stack can reach 25g a stack at raid time (i've heard of people selling them for 30g for 5) and average around 20g on Zul'jin at off-raid times.  Fel mana potions are just as bad and buying the mats to circumvent the crafting overhead is no cheaper.  I've been trying to keep up but it's hard to raid, farm, and maybe try some other aspects this game has to offer. I hate telling my friends I can't go run a heroic with them because I need time to farm stuff so I can pay for my consumables.  In a learning week it's is no problem to go through 25 elixirs without blinking.  I'm estatic we're at the point where I can worry about mana pots only since our Gruul's-lair clears, and kara clears are done with only "normal" consumable usage.  Meaning: Some people will throw on an elixir or something, but overall noone is using anything beyond mana/health pots, but tank consumables are still, as always, sky high.  Still holding out hope that Blizzard will address the necessity of a fully-potted tank.  It's almost funny to hear on vent "sweet, we killed gruul completely unpotted" "Well, the we still had titans and crap on the MT"  "Well....that doesn't count, you need that for everything."<br>
<br>
EDIT 2: Commenting further on mana pots and health pots.  The basic super mana potion or health potion, imo, should be available on a vendor besides the combat elixirs.  It shouldn't even need a "zone token" like some have suggested.  Leave the fel mana pots and such for alchemists, but I'd be thrilled to be able to go to a vendor and pick up pet food, ammo, and a couple stacks of mana pots.  Say.......5g per stack? thats pretty fair, i'd think in relation to other vendor purchasables.  I already accept the above (ammo, repair bills, pet food, non-mage food/water) as part of my day to day costs, it would be nice if plain old mana pots were on the same order.</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->I've read this post 4 times now and I can't decide towards which game your agenda leans, but it permeates this post and makes me distrust you. This post screams shill. <br>
<br>
Even assuming that Hyjal and BT are the bee's knees, you forget that we will all have to struggle through SSC and TK to get to at least Hyjal. Stop telling us there's a light at the end of the tunnel. There should be no god-damned tunnel to begin with.<br>
<br>
This game has been out for 2+ years now. The fact that every single instance they ever release has to be tuned and retuned after release smacks of borderline incompetence. I understand it is quite the undertaking to design and balance a raiding instance, but for christ's sake,  <b>this should not keep reoccurring over and over, especially given the long and documented recommendations of hundreds if not thousands of the most avid customers </b> that seek nothing more then to help in the creation of their own fun. Resources are not a question for a company that makes millions of dollars a month in subscription fees. <br>
<br>
Please don't feed us lines about how the developers have their own vision of the game and this is unbending or unyielding. There is instance after instance of reversals under intense public pressure, not to mention non-publicly triggered design flip-flops. Please show me those strong philosophies still at play from launch, because at this point, knowing what we know, the excitement of going further in the game is next to nil. This game is slowly turning into the very game it sought to redefine. Instead of the leveling treadmill, we have the raiding treadmill. Instead of simple, summon and go instances, we're back to overly demanding keying processes to simply enter places. We were promised clear and fun tradeskills to augment our playing, and now we're turning into the same kind of slog that crafting in EQ was. Virtually everything that was fun and unique and drew everyones interest is either being slowly bled out of the game, or replaced completely with old, outdated and unfun mechanics. The sole highlight in all of this is the Arena system, which has been a rousing success, but the model was already there from SC/War2/3, so there really was little original about the system. <br>
<br>
When you can provoke white-hot rage from one of the most level-headed intellectual players in the game, you know something is terribly, terribly wrong. I don't think I'm out of place when I believe that guild morale virtually world wide is generally pretty low at this point. It doesn't have to be this way, and many of us miss the old feelings that this game used to give us. Perhaps they're just fated to be gone forever, perhaps not. <br>
<br>
2 years is a very long time to consistently deliver content, and in many cases the game has been moments of absolute brilliance in the genre and in game design in general. Perhaps it is the fate of all giants to eventually rest on their laurels, I just remember when WoW had a chip on its shoulder and was trying to prove something to the rest of the gaming world. Now that it's become an institution onto itself, it almost seems like any decision that is made is made in an echo chamber where people reassure each other of what a good idea things can be. <br>
<br>
Perhaps it is a failure in leadership, but if one looks at the design decisions of much of the last few months, one comes to the inescapable conclusion that there is no consistent design theory. One needs only to look on the ceaseless waffling on druid design to see a prime example of this. <br>
<br>
"Is this fun" used to be the design creedo and marketing buzz phrase that drew so much interest in the game. You took the game and every single part of it and asked, "is this fun?' and if it wasn't, it was imperative to redesign the mechanics in a way that made it fun. Vanilla created a world where leveling and even making money and crafting never felt like chores.<br>
<br>
So with that in mind, I wonder, if the company still has that design vision in their head, and still asks:<br>
<br>
Is this fun?</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->The lead designers have also shown a tendancy to be completely stupid on occasion.<br>
<br>
Meetingstones? Fractured server communities by making factions unable to communicate with each other? Consumables? Rampant, joy destroying, consumables?<br>
<br>
They have also demonstrated a strong desire to hold on to ideas far beyond the time they have been proved silly, damaging, or just pointless.<br>
<br>
The basic premise of consumables is the problem. If using X is a notable gain then you must either tune around X and make it a requirement or tune around the absence of X and make the encounters trivial. Blizz is forced to tune around X because trivial does not a challenging and rewarding endgame make.<br>
<br>
The suggesting (that you implied certain devs would dismiss out of hand) would solve this but making the risk v reward for a 25 man group marginal, and thus not necessary but instead optional. Yet at the same time outside raiding they would be just as powerful as they were previously. Surely it might have flaws when you put it's through its paces, but it's not an idea that deserves to be dismissed out of hand.<br>
<br>
As for the person above; don't worry, level grinds will be back next expansion! It will be lots of fun rerolling once the level cap goes up again!</div>

<br>
Having been detached from raiding for a while, I don't know whether to laugh or cry at people's reactions sometimes. There was a time when the idea of flasking whole raids would've been thought simply absurd. Now that we'll "only" be required to do that, I see cheering of all things.<br>
<br>
So far the sweeping consumable changes are going to save a raiding healer a mageblood elixir and an elixir of healing power per try, totalling 16 mana / 5 and 50 healing. That still leaves a flask, manapots, dark runes(why are these even usable on 70?), mana oils, food and booze buffs to worry about and a gain of about 250 mana / 5s from consumables. Not quite the sweeping change I'd have wanted to see, so far.<br>
<br>
It'll actually be interesting to see what happens to the server economy. I expect to see the amount of people using flasks rise as people who formerly sticked to using elixirs will be turning to flask users. Mana thistle seems to be going at an affordable price of 100g per stack atm on my server, can't wait to see how it'll be a couple months from now.</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->For guilds that are behind the curve slightly like mine (working on magtheridon and getting people their SSC keys), our morale is fine since we're not beating our faces against insane content in SSC/TK25, hats off to you folks at the level and dealing with it.  But.......that in no way makes it right at all.  It's only a matter of time before an even larger number of guilds get into SSC and see what everyone is really up in arms over.  The only relief in sight is 2.1 going to the PTR and players being able to test and give feedback.  The longer the gap between now and that happening the more turnover will occur in top end guilds.<br>

		<div id="post_message_324731" class="post_message_underline">I believe we saw that clarification. And the resounding cry was - why should we have to farm one flask per two hours of raiding? In what possible permutation of logic is this "fun"? Is one flask better than one flask + elixirs? Yes. Have I heard a convincing argument as to why that flask should be there? Nope.<br>
<br>
Scrap non-reactive consumables. If they can't figure that out then scrap all consumables in raid zones. And if that's too complicated then scrap alchemy altogether. I'm an alchemist/herbalist. I won't cry. Trust me.<br>
<br>
(Yes, there are better options then scrapping alchemy, and many of them have been mentioned already. But if it's a choice between scrapping alchemy and the proposed 2.1 situation of "Oh, you just need one flask each" I won't hesitate for a second.)<br>
<br>
On a more cheerful note, maybe they'll tune SSC down to the Gruul/Mag level of no consumables beyond the tank required? We're certainly not going to be going near the place until they do...</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->How, exactly, can you call this awesome?<br>
<br>
You are still forced to farm loads of herbs for every single raiding night. If you read closely the Blizzard quote you posted, you will see it states "We will be balancing to take into account the use of a single flask on each player in an encounter". This Flask will be there even after the boss is on farm, unless the gear is being buffed A LOT.<br>
<br>
Also now that you're "expected" to have 2 Flasks for every raiding night, Mana Thistle/Fel Lotus will skyrocket to incredible prices. People will still have to farm nearly/exactly the same amount (in time) than before this "change", because there will be more people herbing the few nodes.<br>
<br>
I can't understand how people think it's "ok" to be forced to Flask for every single boss encounter? Is there really so few people who remember when Flasking your MT was the only consumable needed?<br>
<br>
As an Alchemist/Herbalist, I say remove the damn profession from the game, or at least make Flasks/Elixirs unusable in raids.<br>
<br>
Definitely with Quigon on this one.</div>

		<div id="post_message_324756" class="post_message_underline">Really I see the vast majority of posts everywhere asking for alchemy to be severely limited Basically I'd say that alchemy should be in line in day to day utility as any other profession. It isn't. People are right that the proposed changes don't address the problem at all because if tuned that way we still look at 3 high end pots and off-consumables for everybody. What people say is, and what the game provided until mid-Naxx, was an occasional pot here or there while learning/early farming is about right.<br>
<br>
If someone above is right and the design philosophy is that "alchemy" checks are part of boss designs now, then clearly there is a disconnect between what I hear the vast majority of raiders find acceptable and what the game designers want.<br>
<br>
TBH if Blizz announced a change that usually what we get. The only immediate reversal I can remember (correct me if I missed some) was the recent pala upset.<br>
<br>
There are many good ways to fix alchemy. Make some pots BoP (every other crafting profession has this). Give flasks a chance of failing and causing negative side-effects (ala engineering goodies). Tune most encounters to be beatable without pots and with sensible amounts of regen pots. Protection or special function pot encounter designs are fine if they are the rare exception not the norm, best they can be grown out of by gearing. Make sure that no encounter ever needs BoP pots.<br>
<br>
Remove some i.win pots like limited invulnerability pots or lower the encounters where such pots are needed to make the situation viable. Make all pots that stack on the same stat or function (spell crit/int, AP/AGI/STR, AGI/crit, SPI/MP5, AGI/Armor/dogde etc) not stack. Overall cap the total gain of consumables to roughly 0.5 to 1.5 tier levels of gear, best not exceeding 1 tier of upgrades (guarantees gear substitution with progression). Only sensible exception I can see is stamina through food.<br>
<br>
I think we'd get an alchemy profession that's more in line with other professions that way.<br>
<br>
Beside repair bots nothing an engineer can do is honestly useful for raiding. Why is there one single profession that's allowed to dominate the raiding game really? Makes no sense and if that's the design philosophy it's pretty broken.</div>

Hmm actually the change of player buff stacking is interesting. Maybe this does mean that one finally gets another handle on the chain mana regen potting issue by potting int heavily.</div>

Intellect is a completely trivial stat, and the amount of mana it adds is only relevant at the start of a fight, or as a multiplier for ability that scale with int (shamans / paladins with crit, etc).<br>
<br>
The initial size of a mana pool is usually a very small fraction of the mana that one ends up using on a raid, buffing the initial size won't allow you to not use mana potions unless the content is trivial to begin with.</div>

<br>
I use Elixir of Major Agility twice per week, presently. One is on Aran, because it's the one time I get to DPS so I enjoy the little race. It's entirely optional, though. The other, that I don't consider optional (but it probably is) is Prince Malchezaar.<br>
<br>
I mail every single mana potion I find to a guild healer (whoever I feel has gotten the least potion love from me recently). With a 2 tank/3 healer/5 dps breakdown in Karazhan, if everyone is doing that, the chain chugging isn't terrible. 5 minute cooldown and we'd probably break even or have a profit, at that.<br>
<br>
Could Blizzard please post a sign outside instances they're going to tune like a-- - I mean, to require more than that - so I know to never take my guild there? If Blizzard is afraid of us getting bored and quitting WoW for want of content because it's exactly after Karazhan, maybe they should recognize Terokkar Forest is significantly <b>before</b> Karazhan. We do, and I can't even stand <b>leveling</b> there.<br>
<br>
Like others have said, the arena system is vastly more appealing. My 5's team should be called "Ten Losses A Week," and hey, for an hour and a half of "effort" a <b>month</b> (less then we put in <b>a night</b> in PVE), we're going to get our epic chestpieces before the guild does. All five of us. We never need to get better, we never need to get lucky (yay for second ever priest/druid/warrior token drop...) we never need to farm herbs... heck, if I had a sufficently heavy dipping bird thing, I wouldn't even need to BE THERE to get my sweet epics.<br>
<br>
And that's what it's all about, isn't it? The phat purpz. I mean, you've never met someone in real life, and gone, "Wow dude you play WoW too? Do you raid? Wow sweet! How far are you? Having trouble with ThatGuy? Have you tried ThisThing?" ... for values of ThisThing being, "LoS healers away from Chromaggus" versus "Farm Terokkar for a hundred herbs... every night."<br>

We always had a few members that wanted to stand out from the pack go nuts on elixirs and flasks, but we got through Grobby pre-TBC without mass required consumables.  Now we are having a big internal debate.  A lot of members simply don't want to raid if they have to farm for hours for each raid - the idea of an entire raid flasking up is ludicrous to them.  We have required flasks on a couple mag attempts, and it generally worked out but many people were very unhappy with the prospect of "flasks required" becoming a trend.<br>

In the end, barring any major potion nerfs, cutting edge guilds will always fully pot up and power through encounters tuned for an average, mostly-unpotted raid.

</div>It comes down to Blizzard not wanting to destroy Alchemy like they have destroyed other professions. Its Blizzards way of you investing extra time of course and adding extra timesinks. You don't need flasks to beat any encounter I know we have killed. Not one of them requires it the only reason we used them at one point was to make sure we killed the boss and moved on as fast as possible.<br>
<br>
If the bosses required you had flasks to even kill them would be one thing instead its just some part of an equation on learning time in which if you spend more time prepping you in theory kill the boss faster for your first time. If you spend less time prepping you expect then to spend more time on perfecting your execution.<br>
<br>
<br>
Edit: I know its a game and you can argue you shouldn't have to do unfun stuff to do fun stuff but apparently Blizzard disagrees and unless you convince them otherwise of this its going to be hard to get them to change the system. <br>
<br>
I have to say though I wouldn't mind a system where you walk in and work on how to beat the boss then kill the boss once and never ever kill it a second time with no extra things needed from ingame (so you might have to spend time working on stuff but it would be out of game). But, I don't see people arguing for we shouldn't have to farm bosses here either :-/</div>

</div>Well for my part.. I personally believe a better solution would be to nerf the relative power of flasks and increase the prevalence of herbs - basically transform flasks + elixirs into a readily accessable speedbump, as opposed to a farm-intensive necessity.<br>
<br>
I agree that this is leading to a situation where raid encounters are tuned to the implicit assumption that everyone is flasked.  But by implication isn't the current situation possibly worse?  Are current raid encounters tuned to the assumption that we have even more alchemy buffs than 'just' a flask?<br>
<br>
At some point, elixirs et. al. stopped being useful and started becoming necessary.  It may be better, in the long run, not just to fix the profession, but to break the underlying mindset - that bringing a bunch of pots and blitzing an encounter is a time investment you make to for the benefit of peace of mind, as opposed to a necessary evil you undertake to make the encounter beatable.</div>

Alchemy / Herbalism still has numerous benefits, like other trades. And, if it's that bad after the fact, throw in or make a few potions (destruction, haste, etc) BoP.

Okay - what I said is probably incorrect - I doubt that's their philosophy.  I'm sure they want to cater to both hardcore raids and casual raids, right?  Maybe with the itemization buffs next patch, we can expect for casual raiders to be able to outgear the encounters?  They never said they weren't nerfing flasks.  Maybe they're actually nerfing the max potion buffs to be equivalent to one tier worth of equipment, and buffing the tiers in the meantime to make it so that if you farm your previous tier, you can beat a next tier raid "tuned for flasks".</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">My guild has never done any significant potting other than the MT until TBC.  We always had a few members that wanted to stand out from the pack go nuts on elixirs and flasks, but we got through Grobby pre-TBC without mass required consumables.  Now we are having a big internal debate.  A lot of members simply don't want to raid if they have to farm for hours for each raid - the idea of an entire raid flasking up is ludicrous to them.  We have required flasks on a couple mag attempts, and it generally worked out but many people were very unhappy with the prospect of "flasks required" becoming a trend.<br>
<br>
In the end, barring any major potion nerfs, cutting edge guilds will always fully pot up and power through encounters tuned for an average, mostly-unpotted raid.  Blizzard is fixing nothing other than lowering the farming requirements for those cutting edge guilds.  They are not making any encounters more accessible to the other 95%.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">What exactly is your complaint beyond flasks else than the upfront large cost which should be adjusted more if they expect everyone on the raid to have it (as has been shown in that recent blue post)?<br>
<br>
You keep looking at this huge upfront cost then say flasks should be gotten rid of while ignoring the cheaper use once things that are more expensive. If you want to say get rid of flasks then you probably better be going for getting rid of alchemy completely.</div>

</div>I'm not trying to tackle everything in one sentence.  <br>
<br>
Flasks have a myriad of problems, and that is SEPARATE from elixirs.  Flasks alone are a problem, even if no other elements of alchemy existed.<br>
<br>
1.  They cost too much to have 25 people in a raid maintain every 2 hours.<br>
2.  They take too much time in man hours to sustain (related to #1), and create too much burnout for players to maintain indefinitely... this is tedious, and unfun to pick flowers for your flasks.  <br>
3.  They're too powerful.  The differences in encounter difficulty are markedly different with even a few flasks popped in a raid.  <br>
4.  They screw up the ability for the developers to tune an encounter appropriately due to this power shift.  <br>
5.  They cannot be compensated for through other means, other professions, or sometimes even through gear.  <br>
<br>
What is gained by having flasks?<br>
1.  An ability to greatly increase player strength through time spent outside of a raid - rather than through execution or "skill" during a raid.  <br>
2.  Blizzard is able to create a time sink for players to feel like they are doing something meaningful.  <br>
<br>
Now #1 and #2  in cons may be discussed in relation to elixirs.  I don't care... the fact that elixirs are screwed up also doesn't mean flasks are magically OK...  If we want to talk about whats most efficient and optimal, thats fine, but that doesn't make any of this nonsense OK or acceptable (this is why this patch makes things worse).  Most people will readily agree that popping a flask is more cost effective on a wipe night.  That is really the crux of the problem, not the solution to the issue.</div>

</div>Just because everyone else is doing it doesn't mean you have to participate in it just because you want to be up at the front. If the time spent perfecting your execution is less than the time saved by flasking then you shouldn't be using flasks, but no guilds bother doing an evaluation of the best way to save guild time (though there is additional benefits of course in consumables its time that can be spent not all together).<br>

At the moment most our raid members spend a total of 1 flask a week on Leotheras and prolly not even there shortly since looking like having enough time on our kills before enrage that its unnecessary.</div>

Exactly.  Can we stop spazzing about how "OMG flasks r required nowz!!!" They are no more required now than they were before; Blizzard was already balancing around all available consumables... overtuning is less possible in 2.1 than it was before, though still a legitimate concern.<br>
<br>
I still advocate a real solution being the outright removal or significant nerfing of flasks (halving their material costs and strength would be about right); the power differential between flasked and unflasked is too great to balance around properly.  However, this change is MUCH better than no change at all.<br>
<br>
Mana potions also need to change, and haven't at all.  Sigh.   Upping the mana potion cooldown to 4min instead of 2 would be a huge leap forward, and you'd actually have to think about what potions to drink if health/prot potions were left at 2min.</div>

		<div id="post_message_325065">The problem is that while it was clear that it was an incomplete preview, it wasn't clear whether the incompleteness was a matter of depth or breadth.  The flask/elixir changes were presented fairly comprehensively, in a manner that made them seem like "This is the Official Blizzard Solution regarding raid consumables."  The parts to be filled in later were things like the new elixirs being introduced, and things like that.<br>
<br>
But if there are in fact other major mechanics changes coming down the pipeline that weren't hinted at, then that's good.<br>
<br>
But the Preview definitely came across as presenting a complete picture of the raid consumable changes.  <br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">There's a very simple explanation for the disparity between arena "ez-mode" epics and pve: content consumption.<br>
<br>
PvP is what some like to call 'player-made' content - I think it's a stupid way to describe, but it captures the main point. There's very little dev work involved and it lasts for a long long time. <br>
<br>
PvE is different. PvE content is consumed - and can run out. Hence, various time-sinks and blocks are put in to slow consumption: repair costs, consumables, attunements, lock-out timers/raid ids, trash, etc. <br>
<br>
The loot in pvp serves to give people temporary goals and keep them interested. Hence it needs to be available for everyone (or the "lower end" wouldn't bother), and it needs to be doled out regularly. The old honor system fiasco showed them that a system like the current one is what is needed to get people to pvp.<br>
<br>
The loot in pve is a progression device. It serves to increase the power of characters so they can  consume more content. However, it is my opinion, that this progression devices was basically removed (or neutered to the extreme) in order to maintain pvp balance. In essence in raid-pve they can have gear curve which goes from 5-man blue gear -&gt; arena gear. As the top pve and pvp gear is approximately equal (gross generalization, but in principle) - gear cannot be the primary progression device, as that would allow "easy" acquisition of gear through pvp for rapid consumption of pve content.

I think it is much more likely that the people designing pve and the people responsible for pvp are not the same, and don't talk nearly enough.  As a result we have basically the complete opposite of the old game, where instead of the absurd rank 14 grind, we have pve consumable grind.  Then instead of fairly easy to learn pve content and lots of good epic loot drops, we have the arena system.<br>
<br>
Blizzard needs to apply the same sort of model the pvp designers used to pve.  Low time sinks, high fun, and parallel rewards (which have NO random factor).</div>

</div>So flasks essentially act as a "through-death" alternative to elixirs with an appropriate cost.  I think this could be a great solution.  <br>

Nice change Jeff... I think this one has some serious, long lasting meat to it.  Someone above posted almost exactly this as a suggestion and a few people quoted it as liking it.  I know you guys didn't use his suggestion, but its reassuring at least to see that one of the suggestions above which was well respected matched so closely to the ultimate solution.</div>

</div>This is the single huge point that needed to be in the preview.  Thanks. <br>
<br>
If flasks become more akin to stronger Wizard/Mana Oils where a modest investment gives a long-term buff, and where the buff isn't grossly disproportionate to gear upgrades, then that's what we've all been wanting.<br>
<br>
As originally presented, I think everyone was envisioning two Relentless Assaults (or Supreme Powers, or Fortifications, or whatever) a night from now until Illidan, and that was understandably disturbing, I think.</div>

</div>Tigole, man, if you greatly reduced the power and the *reagents* so flasks only have the benefit of lasting through death, you are really awsome.<br>
<br>
I don't think you can blame people for freaking out though, you know, as well as any poster on this board that the problem is *that bad* right now..Giving such a small snipet without these other changes was pretty rediclous, of course people were freaking.<br>
<br>
I know there is probably a lot of red tape, but man, how hard could it have been to get this information out with the preveiw? (thats not sarcasim btw, I know its probably something like your bosses bosses boss tells you not to, or your marketing dept ect.)<br>

Those first two actually make a HUGE difference, and change considerably the perceived balance issues people have been complaining about in this thread.

</div>Fair enough; perhaps we've been a bit eager to critique what 2.1 will and won't be. You have to keep in mind though that it has been a LONG time since the last content patch so it's understandable that people are a bit antsy.<br>
<br>

EDIT: I'd also agree with Mael's comment, Tigole, though I'd not call it selfish. Even giving us misleading information was better than giving us none. The fact that we had some concrete info on changes in the pipeline gave us some hope, and I think the majority of this thread was meant as an attempt to dialogue with you about what else we'd like to see.<br>

Had there been no post, there would have been less noise, but more bitterness and account cancellings, imo.</div>

In this case it was more a matter of substance and solution, rather than words and rhetoric.  The fact that the solutions are so sweeping and exacting, and really go straight to the heart of the problem actually reassures me that the devs understand the situation better than I had thought.

Yah, thats the kind of stuff thats made of gold.<br>

Tigole posting shows that he understands the issuue and is changing it with a real understanding of it, which is what counts (Sorry to repeat you, I am just excited right now).</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->I think the SSC trash drop was likely a loot table error.  No one has seen one from trash since then, afaik.  They're from Vashj and presumably Kael.  I don't think it's that unreasonable given that they make a guaranteed tier 6 weapon.  <br>
<br>
I also would not be surprised if you could get them more readily in actual tier 6 zones.<br>
<br>
Kind of like how you CAN get Primal Nethers from nonheroics, but if you tried to get all 10-12 you need to upgrade your gear from nonheroics only, you'd shoot yourself before you got halfway there.  Vortices give you gear that is better than tier 5, so it's to be expected that the primary means for obtaining them should be beyond tier 5.  The point of smithing is to guarantee smiths a good epic piece of roughly the current tier of content, not to give them something worlds better.</div>

		<div id="post_message_325159" class="post_message_underline">I don't see it being 'useless' but 'less useful'. It'll put it more on par with most of the other professions, where it is almost certainly a requirement now to have many alchemists, but you can get by with only a few enchanters, tailors, blacksmiths, engineers. Enchanting -- weapon enchants make or break, but the rest of the enchants are simply icing. Blacksmithing, weapons are the big bump, followed by stones, etc, but not a huge thing for a raid. Engineers.. fun trinkets, some good scopes, but nothing game-breaking for a raid to have.. Tailors have very little they get to do. Leatherworking for the most part, too. Leg 'enchants' from the various professions are also Very Nice Things to have, but nothing so near as critical as alchemy has been.<br>

I think this is turning flasks into less powerful entities to make them less daunting. The idea is probably that you flask when you expect to wipe a lot, but you want just a bit of a bump to get past a hurdle of some kind. An extra 500-1000 HPs or something like that. Maybe a little extra damage. Elixirs/potions will now become a 'do I take X or Y'? You'll still have cooking (I assume) to help stack a little bit.<br>
<br>
Of course, now the Alchemists are starting to sound like Engineers did when TBC's recipes came out a few months ago...</div>

List ALL the changes now to the professions. Posting here for those who can't read the wow boards.<br>
<br>
 Due to popular demand, we are revealing all of the current notes for professions in the upcoming content patch. Please remember, all notes may be subject to change.<br>
<br>
Alchemy<br>
<br>
<br>
    * The chance of a discovery occurring while making potions has been substantially increased.<br>
    * Elixirs now stack in two categories, Battle (Offensive) and Guardian (Defensive) Elixirs. You can only have one of each type of Elixir up at a time. As a result Elixirs now stack with class abilities such as "Arcane Intellect."<br>
    * Elixirs now stack to 20.<br>
    * Four new defensive elixirs have been added. Two are on trainers, one is in Halaa and one is in Cenarion Expedition.<br>
    * "Flask of Petrification" can no longer be turned off during its duration, but it now will clear all threat from all monsters for the duration of the effect. Though monsters may reacquire you after the effect ends.<br>
    * Cooldown time on "Earthstorm" and "Skyfire Diamond" transmutes has been reduced to 1 day.<br>
    * "Invulnerability" potions now stop the first 120 damage per hit for 8 seconds, rather than making the imbiber physically immune.<br>
    * The major protection potions made by Alchemy now require more "Mana Thistle" and vials, but create 5 potions instead of just one.<br>
    * "Fel Strength" elixirs now work correctly with elixir mastery.<br>
    * "Elemental Absorption" potions now have a 2 minute duration rather than the 60 min duration they used to have.<br>
    * Alchemy transmute of "Heart of Fire" to "Elemental Fire" changed to 15 minute cooldown.<br>
    * Reagent costs and potency of all flasks has been reduced.<br>
    * The cost of "Imbued Vials" has been reduced.<br>
    * The chance to find a "Fel Lotus" while picking an herb has been increased.<br>
    * "Juju Chill" and "Juju Ember" are now considered Guardian Elixirs and do not stack with other resistance buffs.<br>
    * "Juju Flurry" is now considered a Battle Elixir and has been converted from haste to haste rating.<br>
    * "Ground Scorpok Assay","Juju Might","Juju Power", "Lung Juice Cocktail", and R.O.I.D.S are now considered Battle Elixirs.<br>
    * "Crystal Force", "Crystal Ward","Gizzard Gum", "Infallible Mind","Juju Escape", "Juju Guile", "Sheen of Zanza" and Swiftness of Zanza are all now considered Guardian Elixirs.<br>
    * "Sheen of Zanza" is now considered a Guardian Elixir. Stamina and Spirit bonuses have been reduced to 25.<br>
    * "Elixir of Fortitude" now correctly displays its name in its buff tooltip.<br>
    * The "Alchemist's Stone" bonus now works on potions that restore both health and mana.<br>
<br>
<br>
Enchanting<br>
<br>
<br>
    * Enchant Bracer-Spellpower had its primal costs reduced slightly.<br>
    * Enchanting recipes that increase spell damage now also increase healing as well.<br>
    * The "Major Defense Bracer" enchantment has been moved from Ethereum Researchers to Ethereum Nullifiers.<br>
<br>
<br>
Engineering<br>
<br>
<br>
    * A recipe for "Frost Grenades" and the "Icy Blasting Primers" needed to make them are now on engineering trainers.<br>
    * Engineering recipes can now be placed in engineering bags, as can engineer made fireworks.<br>
    * Many engineering recipes will now give skillups for longer than the previously did.<br>
    * An engineering recipe to make "Fused Wiring" can be found in both Everlook and Shattrath.<br>
    * Engineering Skill required to make the "Felsteel Stabilizer", "Hardened Adamantite Tube" and "Khorium Power Core" have been reduced slightly.<br>
    * "Adamantite Shells" now require less adamantite and do slightly more damage.<br>
    * The recipe for "Elemental Blasting Powder" now gives 4 powder when creating it, though it now requires an additional mote of earth.<br>
    * Engineers now make 3 "Smoke Flares" instead of just one when they create them. Also "Smoke Flares" now have a buy/sell price.<br>
    * "Seaforium" now opens locked chests as well as locked doors.<br>
    * The Consortium Vendor Karaaz now sells the engineering recipe for an "Elemental Seaforium Charge" if you are revered with them.<br>
    * The "Poultryizer" has a smaller chance of getting malfunction effects and is now a superior quality item.<br>
    * The "Nigh Invulnerability Belt" now has a smaller chance of failure.<br>
    * "Healing Potion Injectors" and "Mana Potion Injectors" created by engineers now have new icons.<br>
    * "Goblin Rocket Launcher" now has a 2 minute cooldown, and had its casting time reduced to 3.5 sec.<br>
<br>
<br>
Fishing<br>
<br>
<br>
    * The fishing timer has been reduced from 30 to 20 seconds and it now takes less time to fish.<br>
    * The fishing timer can no longer run through its duration without a fish biting.<br>
    * Fishing has been removed from Arathi Basin and Alterac Valley.<br>
    * You can now fish in Underbog.<br>
<br>
<br>
Jewelcrafting<br>
<br>
<br>
    * The jewelcrafting UI now has gems split up by color so it is easier to find gems of a specific color to create.<br>
    * A new set of more powerful gems can be found by raiding Hyjal and Black Temple. Their stats exceed those of previous gems that could be found.<br>
    * A number new gem cuts to existing gems have been added to the game. Included among them are a spell hit gem and more multi-stat gems that have attack power on them.<br>
    * Jewelcrafters can make two new melee oriented meta gems. One is found randomly as a world drop and the other sold by the reputation vendor.<br>

It is a case of paying more for getting more than one benefit, an option i would like to have. I guess i just view the increased price of using 2 elixirs as an opportunity cost.</div>

The changes listed are by no means the extent of the changes going into the patch. They are a mere preview of *SOME* of the changes to come.<br>

	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>
<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->Posting this after reading all the replies (including the flask changes, etc.) I have to point out that the community reaction here was to be expected.<br>
<br>
You, Tigole, are the steward not only of a big part of an engaging MMO, but also of a legacy of greatness (Blizzard's fantastic video games) that you were not around to help create. People are passionate not only about WoW but about the fact that they expect stellar games from Blizzard. I would wager that a vast majority of the people who become so emotional about any video game are also the kind who pursue the raiding game in WoW. Introduce a raid game with major flaws, and boom, you have a powder keg.<br>
<br>
For the past 3 months, WoW has failed to deliver on the great legacy of Warcraft, Starcraft, and Diablo, and there has been <i>almost no communication</i> from anyone about the problem. Before today it required the <i>stars to align</i> for you to post on the official forums or these boards.<br>
<br>
You see that even a tiny post with real information and actual dialogue can have enough impact to bring EJ's servers to their knees. People like Quigon and Jager (and I include myself) are simply ecstatic over the changes and the communication from your side. I feel like singing a good spiritual or two for Pete's sake. (Free at last, free at last, thank God Almighty, we are free at last!) <br>
<br>
The same people who are passionate about this game are thirsty for some communication. For the history of WoW, that communication has been sorely lacking on Blizzard's part. Especially when it becomes clear to the more astute raiders that your CMs are underinformed or have a gag order, they want to hear info from the horse's mouth. For the raid game, that's you.<br>
<br>
If you and the rest of the dev team had simply come out and said, "We didn't really get to finish major sections of TBC's content, including outdoor content and big changes to the raid game and professions, before we had to ship the game," then a lot of people would have been patient with you and waiting with little bitching. (At least on these boards, I can't speak for the cesspool of the official forums.) But there was nothing. What we got was near to stone-cold silence.<br>
<br>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->One of the ideas of TBC was to make it so that non-gathering professions didn't fall into "one for the group and done".  They're supposed to have perks for each profession - BoP items - that add some value beyond being the guild's enchanter, or jewelcrafter, etc.<br>
<br>
Enchanting -&gt; Ring enchants for enchanters only.<br>
Weaponsmithing -&gt; Great, upgradeable weapons (epic).<br>
Tailoring -&gt; Specializations for BoP sets (epic) for various caster types.<br>
Leatherworking -&gt; Okay, so the BoP sets (epic) aren't so great here, but they're there.<br>
Alchemy -&gt; Falls flat, but a BoP (epic) trinket.  Maybe with the coming consumable nerf they'll be given more.<br>
<br>
Jewelcrafting -&gt; BoP (rare) trinkets.<br>
<br>
So the two that don't get epics directly are Enchanting and Jewelcrafting.  The enchants can be put onto epics, and essentially have value over the life of the game, no matter how good the gear its.<br>
<br>
Edit: Let me add that this isn't a game-breaking issue for me.  It's just a tweak that would be nice.  It feels like JC didn't get some of the "make it glamorous" changes the rest got simply because it was new.</div>

Its pretty retarded that consumables provide a significantly larger statistical benefit than gear upgrades. If I wanted to *equal* the amount of armor I get popping Major defense, I'd need to upgrade my shield + 1-2 armor slots. For as much hp as a flask, I'd basically need to replace my entire gear set. No mage/warlock is going to gain 150 spell power in less than, well, a fuck load of upgrades.<br>
<br>
The sky isn't falling, alchemy is going to still be good because its stats you get on top of your gear/buffs, and something is still better than nothing, and if mats costs are going down, thats a good thing too. Its just a shame it didn't happen sooner and content wasn't tuned around that.</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->Actually, something very clear came through with that 'partial preview.'  The information they disclosed, the way they presented it, the phrasing, etc. shows either poor 'translation' from dev to CM or further evidence of the somewhat tenuous grasp on understanding that Blizzard seems to have about the playerbase.  Nobody at the office thought that the phrase "Content will be tuned assuming just one flask per raider" would generate such a malevolent backlash?  It didn't occur to them that what was posted there not only didn't help assuage player fears, but made it worse by basically signing off on ridiculous consumable necessity for progression?<br>
<br>
While I certainly share in the relief that they're actually aware of some of the problems in this game and actively trying to iron them out here and there, I still can't overlook the fact that we still have a ways to go before Blizzard sees eye to eye with the players.<br>
<br>
A ways to go, but here we at least observe a good step.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">One of the ideas of TBC was to make it so that non-gathering professions didn't fall into "one for the group and done".  They're supposed to have perks for each profession - BoP items - that add some value beyond being the guild's enchanter, or jewelcrafter, etc.<br>
<br>
Enchanting -&gt; Ring enchants for enchanters only.<br>
Weaponsmithing -&gt; Great, upgradeable weapons (epic).<br>
Tailoring -&gt; Specializations for BoP sets (epic) for various caster types.<br>
Leatherworking -&gt; Okay, so the BoP sets (epic) aren't so great here, but they're there.<br>
Alchemy -&gt; Falls flat, but a BoP (epic) trinket.  Maybe with the coming consumable nerf they'll be given more.<br>
<br>
Jewelcrafting -&gt; BoP (rare) trinkets.<br>
<br>
So the two that don't get epics directly are Enchanting and Jewelcrafting.  The enchants can be put onto epics, and essentially have value over the life of the game, no matter how good the gear its.<br>
<br>
Edit: Let me add that this isn't a game-breaking issue for me.  It's just a tweak that would be nice.  It feels like JC didn't get some of the "make it glamorous" changes the rest got simply because it was new.</div>

		<div id="post_message_325293" class="post_message_underline">Great changes and finally what the hardcore raiding community wanted to see.  No longer is alot of our raiding time going to be spent farming herbs or having to level alts to farm herbs.  I think this is a very positive step in the right direction and finally brings alchemy in line with all other professions in regards to their power in a raiding environment.  All too long Alchemy was too powerful to begin with in comparison to other professions when it came to buffing raids.  Maybe this will result in alot of herbs going down in price and making raiding that much easier on all of us.  <br>
<br>
I would comment though that if Blizzard was much better about its communication from the get go in regard to these community issues that alot of this would be avoided.  Why is there such a disconnect it seems between yourself at the top and the CM's that are responsible for giving out this info?  Please fix this so that we can avoid these future situations.  Blizzard is much better than this.</div>

I assume they still do.  I assume that this is less CM translation and more the approval department being very picky about what is being released.  I still go back every once in a while and read KDMs posts during the hunter kvetching to really see the frustration she had with being stuck between hunters and the approval department after she had said a date.<br>
<br>
And seriously, who has a more tenuous graps on understanding, Blizzard or us?  Blizzard seems to be working on issues the community brings up while the community goes berserk if it isn't the entire answer to their personal crusade.<br>

		<div id="post_message_325309" class="post_message_underline">I saw an post that looked updated:<br>
<br>
Alchemy <br>
<br>
The chance of a discovery occurring while making potions has been substantially increased.<br>
Elixirs now stack in two categories, Battle (Offensive) and Guardian (Defensive) Elixirs. You can only have one of each type of Elixir up at a time. As a result Elixirs now stack with class abilities such as "Arcane Intellect."<br>
Elixirs now stack to 20.<br>
Four new defensive elixirs have been added. Two are on trainers, one is in Halaa and one is in Cenarion Expedition.<br>
"Flask of Petrification" can no longer be turned off during its duration, but it now will clear all threat from all monsters for the duration of the effect. Though monsters may reacquire you after the effect ends.<br>
Cooldown time on "Earthstorm" and "Skyfire Diamond" transmutes has been reduced to 1 day.<br>
"Invulnerability" potions now stop the first 120 damage per hit for 8 seconds, rather than making the imbiber physically immune.<br>
The major protection potions made by Alchemy now require more "Mana Thistle" and vials, but create 5 potions instead of just one.<br>
"Fel Strength" elixirs now work correctly with elixir mastery.<br>
"Elemental Absorption" potions now have a 2 minute duration rather than the 60 min duration they used to have.<br>
Alchemy transmute of "Heart of Fire" to "Elemental Fire" changed to 15 minute cooldown.<br>
Reagent costs and potency of all flasks has been reduced.<br>
The cost of "Imbued Vials" has been reduced.<br>
The chance to find a "Fel Lotus" while picking an herb has been increased.<br>
"Juju Chill" and "Juju Ember" are now considered Guardian Elixirs and do not stack with other resistance buffs.<br>
"Juju Flurry" is now considered a Battle Elixir and has been converted from haste to haste rating.<br>
"Ground Scorpok Assay","Juju Might","Juju Power", "Lung Juice Cocktail", and R.O.I.D.S are now considered Battle Elixirs.<br>
"Crystal Force", "Crystal Ward","Gizzard Gum", "Infallible Mind","Juju Escape", "Juju Guile", "Sheen of Zanza" and Swiftness of Zanza are all now considered Guardian Elixirs.<br>
"Sheen of Zanza" is now considered a Guardian Elixir. Stamina and Spirit bonuses have been reduced to 25.<br>
"Elixir of Fortitude" now correctly displays its name in its buff tooltip.<br>
The "Alchemist's Stone" bonus now works on potions that restore both health and mana.<br>
Enchanting <br>
Enchant Bracer-Spellpower had its primal costs reduced slightly.<br>
Enchanting recipes that increase spell damage now also increase healing as well.<br>
The "Major Defense Bracer" enchantment has been moved from Ethereum Researchers to Ethereum Nullifiers.<br>
Engineering <br>
<br>
11 new epic goggles have been introduced at 350 engineering skill and are available from the trainer. They range from cloth to plate, and have a variety of stats to appeal to most talent specs.<br>
A recipe for "Frost Grenades" and the "Icy Blasting Primers" needed to make them are now on engineering trainers.<br>
Engineering recipes can now be placed in engineering bags, as can engineer made fireworks.<br>
Many engineering recipes will now give skillups for longer than the previously did.<br>
An engineering recipe to make "Fused Wiring" can be found in both Everlook and Shattrath.<br>
Engineering Skill required to make the "Felsteel Stabilizer", "Hardened Adamantite Tube" and "Khorium Power Core" have been reduced slightly.<br>
"Adamantite Shells" now require less adamantite and do slightly more damage.<br>
The recipe for "Elemental Blasting Powder" now gives 4 powder when creating it, though it now requires an additional mote of earth.<br>
Engineers now make 3 "Smoke Flares" instead of just one when they create them. Also "Smoke Flares" now have a buy/sell price.<br>
"Seaforium" now opens locked chests as well as locked doors.<br>

Guess you might not come back and post more, but anyway...<br>
<br>
I see 2 issues remain:<br>
- Potions. Any changes coming to their cooldown. 3, 4, 5 minutes? They are still really powerful.<br>
<br>
- You say there is now higher droprate for Fel Lotus, okay. But, what about Black Lotus still needed for quite a few flasks. Any consideration to make them more common? <br>
On my server they go for 3-4x price of Fel Lotus. Not only is it a very rare herb, its also in the old world.<br>
<br>
Other than that, the new info posted is nice, its pretty much  my exact wishes from the last few days.</div>

On another note, does blizzard toss darts to decide what info should go into a "preview"?<br>
<br>
Its silly that we got "Content will be tuned assuming just one flask per raider," rather than "Flasks are being re-tuned to be less powerful and much, much less expensive, and raid encounters will be re-tuned to reflect this, along with the other alchemy changes."<br>
<br>
Did they want to start a riot, set us up so Tigole could come in here and knock us all down with a single post and a wash of emotional release?<br>
<br>
I dunno, seems fishy.  Either their relations people are really smart, or really not...</div>

If the wording on the blue post is correct, they are taking a 24 hour or longer cooldown and subtracting 1 hour from it, not actually taking it TO a 1 hour cooldown.  At max, this makes transmuting 1/24 times faster....  /sarcasm Totally Overpowered.</div>

TBC (patch 2.03, technically, but live realms were at 2.06 already) was January 16th, and that was three months ago.<br>

Is 3 and a half content patches a year a place that they really want to be at? It certainly isn't where we want to be at.<br>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->I would actually have to go on the side that this is the wrong fix. The fix would have been as simple as greatly increasing the amount of herb spawns and/or decreasing the mats by a lot. Reducing the power of it simply means that we get to work less for less reward in term of power gained, which isn't really a net gain. That and the tailoring rumors makes me an unhappy raider right now. Let's hope the patch notes are better than this.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I think the real failure here is that somehow they've locked themselves into a 4+ month patch cycle.<br>

2.0.1 came out on December 5, 2006; that was over four months ago.<br>
TBC (patch 2.03, technically, but live realms were at 2.06 already) was January 16th, and that was three months ago.<br>
<br>
<br>
Is 3 and a half content patches a year a place that they really want to be at? It certainly isn't where we want to be at.<br>
<br>
<br>
I think this exercise in videogame brinksmanship (so to speak) could have easily been avoided if they had made 2.1 a patch like 1.8 or 1.10, rather than a 1.9 or 1.11 monster patch.</div>

There are not many companies developing a product with as much code as WoW with a shorter patch/content release cycle.

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->You're thinking about this the wrong way. Conumables are BROKEN, just like 5/4 Windfury. I can bitch till the cows come home about WF getting 'nerfed', but I know it shouldn't have functioned that way in the first place. Same logic applies to consumables. Starting with the creation of flasks they've just spiraled out of control, and the raid game is suffering because of it.<br>
<br>
If they tune boss armor / def around the non-consumable stacked raid, rogues warriors (and enhancement shaman) will still have a place in raids. They did it properly with Gruul, and they can do it with the rest of raid encounters as well.</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->As regards Essences, this is Rampant Speculation, but I'd suppose that most essences <i>were</i> gotten in places that max level characters used to hang out - Silithius and the like.<br>
<br>
If I'm remembering correctly, there's something called.. vertical integration? Or something like that, low level players and high level players impacting each other's gameplay (and not in the "I have 1g... SFK" way). That is, hi, I'm selling you mister level bored 70, 374 tailor some of this netherweave that I have clogging up my level 61 bags that are otherwise bereft of cool things, like, say, money. The problem is, the second someone hits level 58, to Outlands they should go, so there's no natural funnel for essences to continue to join the economy.<br>
<br>
It isn't, at first blush, a max level change. It's simply ensuring that Essence of *, for someone releveling (or leveling in the first place) profession X that optimally could use 16 of them, isn't like finding hens' teeth.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Alterac Valley siege weapons? Hero classes? Blizzard keeps their traps shut for good reason. We'd have been better off with no information at all and seeing everything at once when the patch notes hit than a partial preview that in hindsight was a pretty poor look at the things to come. When they get this kind of backlash for essentially doing what you ask, can you blame them for saying nothing at all?</div>

</div>
<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->No, no information is just as bad as minimal communication.  Basically there is a communication balance that needs to be acheived that we really have not seen in a very long time.<br>
<br>
Giving no communication just leads to complete speculation and makes it appear as if the company is doing absolutely nothing.  You do not want this ever from a business perspective as people will leave or change their business.<br>
<br>
In Blizzard's case giving too much information can lead to disappoint if a feature doesn't get implemented.  Lastly giving very little info when you haven't seen information in a very long time leads to speculation and people picking it apart which is what we have seen here.  After all it was the only thing we really had to go on.<br>
<br>
So you want to strive for a constant steady stream of communication.  People want to see progress and want to know you are still actively doing something.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">No, you're surrounded by people who want to win and if that means flasking they'll do it. I'm sure the habits of most guilds won't change much from what they are right now, simply the output of what their flower picking produces.

</div>So everyone else is surrounded by people that want to lose? No, that isn't it at all. It's a matter of free time and having fun. If your guild is below an age where real life responsibilites do not impact their life, very little of these complaints matter as they have the ability to spend many hours online farming flowers so they can use mass-consumables on broken/over-tuned/bugged encounters. The moment you have debt or more than just a cell phone bill to pay, you are limited in the amount of time you can spend playing video games.<br>
<br>
No matter if you have the free time or not, spending many hours every week farming flower nodes in a virtual world is annoying, tedious, a pain in the ass and certainly NOT fun. I had more fun getting paper cuts while stuffing envelopes at a mass mailing house in high school than I do with any of the mindless repetitive grinds in WoW. I don't know what is worse - the fact that they claimed there would be less of a grind in TBC and we believed them or that we still payed to play out that grind for the last few months.</div>

		<div id="post_message_324335" class="post_message_underline">It doesn't seem to me that flask use (and thus mana thistle prices) will go up significantly.  I tried to think of reasons that people would use more flasks than they do now:<br>
<br>
1) People currently not using flasks and using more than 2 elixirs upgrade to flasks instead of downgrading to 2 elixirs.<br>
2) Blizzard increases encounter difficulty as a result of balancing around flasks, so some people that don't use flasks now start flasking. (My understanding is that they would instead decrease encounter difficulty as a result of not having to balance around flasks + elixirs)<br>
3) Now that Blizzard has admitted that encounters will be balanced with flasks in mind there is a purely psychological effect where people will flask more.<br>
<br>
If point 2 is true, then mana thistle could become pretty scarce.  I think points 1 and 3 are fairly minor.  Am I missing something, or am I wrong about the likelihood of point 2 occuring?<br>
<br>
Oh, something positive is that mana thistle supply should go up, with all the new content in the flying-only zones</div>

Even if you believe, which I do not, that this is a step in the right direction; you need to be careful in realizing blizzard is far less likely to fully fix this at a later time.  This is likely it until this game is dead.  If you can live with content tuned to max buffs (same as before, just max buffs are now barely less... like thats really going to compare to flasks... anyway) then I'm glad you are content.  <br>
<br>
The fact that they even test content with flasks on anyone but maybe the MT is absurd to me.  The fact that flasks change a raid from tier 2 to tier 1 is absurd to me.  The fact that flasks are now essentially encouraged is also absurd imo.  This style of testing is how we got to where we are today kids... and the news flash is that <b>25 man content, not tested by players in TBC, but tested by the fully buffed QA test... sucks</b>, and is largely out of tune.  Our server has 2 guilds that have killed Hydross... one was just last week, and both of these guilds were KT killing guilds.  Is that tuned?  Was Gruul tuned?  Its been 4 months now.  In 4 more months where are things going to be?  Its a sad state of affairs overall, and poor tuning, and statements like this from Blizzard give a strong indication as to where the problem is coming from.  Granted, there are many problems with TBC raiding... but each should be dealt with appropriately... not half assed.  <br>
<br>
2 elixirs is a minimal impact, if any.</div>

Theoretically, what difference does it make between the new alchemy and old alchemy if you are going to flask up the raid anyway? <br>
<br>
You saved the 100(20*5) elixirs that you are going to throw in.<br>
<br>
And they are a lot more expensive than two flasks per night.</div>

</div><br>
They are introducing new Elixirs, most likely there will be fights that are balanced around the buff they give you. On these fights you will most likley kill the Flask and use 2x Elixirs instead. This means even more farming when you think it out. You will need to farm for all the new elixirs as well as the flasks....both will be required no matter what as we know officially know that every enounter is balanced around flowers and not skill. They are tuning fights around a profession that most people will not pick up instead of skill and gear obtained through normal progression....doesn't that seem just dumb to most? Why is Alchemy/Herb considered an optional profession when EVERYONE that wants to make progress needs to have them.  Why isn't this the same for the other professions? Why are professions more important than how well your raid plays together since all the skill in the world won't make up the major gains you pick up via pots/flasks/elixirs.<br>
<br>
I think Quigon has a very valid argument.</div>

I would like them to go with solution B. Besides being easier for Blizzard it makes the professions even in power and desirability. Anything besides solution A or B does not solve the balancing of the professions and anything besides B doesn't solve the grinding consumable problems.</div>

		<div id="post_message_324345" class="post_message_underline">There's a lot of overreaction going on here. I hate flasks with a passion, but Blizz isn't too far off from where they should be in terms of the new elixirs/flasks. They just need to reduce the power and cost values of flasks by about 1/3 so the benefit of using a flask over two elixirs is mostly relegated to the fact that flasks don't disappear on death.<br>
<br>
The problems with TBC raiding aren't just with consumables. It is a combination of consumables, overtuning, and lack of gear progression. The consumables issue only mask the other two issues. A lot of the complaining about the new consumables are mostly due to problems with roots in the other two issues, and you are just looking at the consumable changes in the vacuum assuming that nothing else is addressed. Even if they put a bullet to the head of flasks, overtuning and shitty gear would still mean a shitty raid game. Just a less time consuming shitty raid game.<br>
<br>
Bringing it back to the sanity of the earlier game where potting all the way up is only necessary to try to eek out a first kill if you are a bit undergeared or underskilled requires making encounters tuned towards that, and a consumable spread small enough that they can achieve it without trivialization. This elixir change brings it a lot closer to the reasonable spread to facitate proper tuning. They just need to follow through with the other aspects, of which they are at least are aware.</div>

</div>Look at it from this view: Once they tune the encounters, remove the bugs and increase gar rewards you are still stuck with this 'fix' for alchemy. The fix being that it is still 100% required for you to progress. They didn't solve anything and we still have the other two issues.....so a lot are skeptical at how well those fixes will be.<br>
<br>
Just an FYI on my perspective to this. I was every at every 'first' kill for my guild from BWL up to KT. I was there for a world first and was on many top 5/10 kills on the rest of Naxx. However since I do not have any time to farm for consumables nor farm for the gold to pay for them.....I am no longer raiding. I don't even try to make it home in time for the raids since I would be the only one there without consumables. So, TBC raiding has been almost non existent to me simply because of fucking virtual flowers (and that pesky anti-melee thing didn't help either). I get to watch my guild progress from the sidelines now.</div>

</div>I think it's undeniably a step in the right direction.  They are lessening the number of consumables it's possible to use and tuning encounters for fewer consumable usage than they are currently.<br>
<br>
Whether it's sufficient or not is arguable, and really it comes down to what they mean by "balancing to take into account the use of a single flask".  Does that mean that the fights are going to effectively require a flask?  Or does it mean that a flask will help when you're undergeared, but you'll be able to farm a boss flaskless with a few gear upgrades and the clean execution that comes with practice?<br>
<br>
Admittedly, a single flask is still more powerful than a tier or two of gear upgrades, but coupled with just plain getting better at fights, I can see bosses being tuned to the point where skilled players don't need a flask at all, ever.  Given Blizzard's track record I'm not putting money on that, but based on what they've said, it's entirely possible.  Assuming that the single comment that's been made with respect to flask usage means the absolute worst case of "every boss will require every raider to use a flask every time" seems a little excessive.</div>

This is really looking nice.  I'm almost as emotional as Quigon at the moment, even though I am a much more "casual raider". (Cleared Kara and Gruul, working on getting 25 attuned for SSC)  I went mad with joy when someone in /g mentioned "OMG Tigole just said on EJ flask are getting severely nerfed".  Without these changes this would have probably been it for me as far as raiding goes.<br>

<br>
That said, I'll echo Quigon on his crusade to remove flasks. They're just stupidly overpowered and it's a shame that Blizzard has to balance for them. They should not be the norm, they should be the crutch for "weaker" guilds. When I read Nihilum killed C'thun and they had the whole raid flasked, I also laughed, because it was *that* absurd. So what if the top 50 guilds in the world blow thru the content when flasked? Is that really the standard Blizzard should balance against?<br>
<br>
Edit: read the note about reducing flask power, good. Hope they'll hit the normal potions too, no consumable should equal two tiers of gear upgrades for a single stat.</div>

		<div id="post_message_325746" class="post_message_underline">Wow, amazing changes, I might actually pick up tailoring now to make the sets instead of Alch/Herbalism for my 68 priest alt. This sounds real promising.<br>
<br>
One thing though (There's always one!) that I didn't like was the mining changes. My main income since my farming is a bit slow as a protection warrior, is to ride around on my mount and mine, prospect, and then sell the stuff, or use it on gear upgrades. Depending on how the changes are, having to kill lots of mobs around veins is going to be a pain in the beeehind. I can imagine it won't be as annoying for a prot warrior though as it would be for a resto/holy whatever since I can smack on fury gear. <br>
One thing that speaks in favor for this change is the amusing turn of events PUGs will have with a random Rambo going ahead to mine a vein with a pack nearby.<br>
<br>
Really interested about the primal nether buying too, guessing the cost for nethers will go down now on craftables, I'll just raise the crafting price to compensate though </div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->  Yeah, alternating nigh-invuln belt and limited invuln pots was pretty dumb. It is sad though whenever uniquely powerful things like this are nerfed. <br>
<br>
  Overall it seems they completely missed the point of engineering. I at least, took engineering because of the unique things it provides, not because I wanted to craft cool sets of gear. Even if the helms are amazing(which they probably won't be, given the current epic helms), it'll still just be an imitation of other professions such as Blacksmithing and Tailoring, which provide a wider range of very good weapons/armor. <br>

		<div id="post_message_325775" class="post_message_underline">We wanted to give players a closer glimpse at the changes being made regarding flask reagent costs and potency in patch 2.1. Please see the example below:<br>
<br>
Flask of Mighty Restoration - Current<br>
Instant<br>
Regenerate 70 mana per 5 sec for two hours.<br>
<br>
Dreaming Glory x20<br>
Mana Thistle x10<br>
Fel Lotus x1<br>
<br>
Flask of Might Restoration - Patch 2.1<br>
Instant<br>
Regenerate 25 mana per 5 sec for two hours.<br>
<br>
Dreaming Glory x7<br>
Mana Thistle x3<br>
Fel Lotus x1<br>
<br>
(Please Note: The drop rate for Fel Lotus is also being increased by approximately 15% in the same patch)<br>
<br>
Players will notice that while the effect of the flask has been dramatically reduced, so has the cost to create one. All alchemy flasks will be adjusted similarly. Lets look at an elixir with the same effect for comparison:<br>
<br>
Elixir of Major Mageblood<br>
Instant<br>
Regenerate 16 mana per 5 sec for 60 min.<br>
<br>
Ancient Lichen x1<br>
Netherbloom x1<br>
<br>
While the flask still requires more materials than this elixir, it also allows 9 more mana to regenerate per 5 seconds, lasts twice as long, and persists through death. The flask is probably best used when facing encounters that are especially challenging to your party or raid.<br>
<br>
Also, we've seen players request details on the four new elixirs scheduled to go live with the next content patch and as a result, they've been detailed below.<br>
<br>
    * Elixir of Draenic Wisdom: Intellect and Spirit are increased by 25.<br>
    * Earthen Elixir: Reduces both spell and physical damage taken by 20.<br>
    * Elixir of Ironskin: Resilience is raised by 30.<br>
    * Elixir of Major Fortification: Increases health by 250 and provides 10 health every 5 seconds.<br>

While the alchemy changes are alot better than they first looked, i pretty much figured we didn't have the whole story there.

If the patch goes live as it sits right now this will probably be the end of my 2 and a half year WoW career. That may seem melodramatic and whiney, but my rogue has been a skinner/leatherworker since about an hour after Archimonde went live in Nov 04. And i'm tired of waitign for th next patch  and the next patch and the one after that to get any much needed changes. This will be what the third, forth patch since TBC went live that made itemization changes and primal intent is still ~10ilevels underbudget, and spends those points it does spend in the most idiotic way possible. But that damn set bonus needed fixing, i didn't know whether to laugh or cry when i read the notes this evening in the profesion forums. Not even the courtesy of making it so we could start crafting the sets at 350 instead of 375 like tailorign and blacksmithing. then to ad insult in to injury the friggen tailorign sets got thie chestpeices changed to robes to much cheering. <br>
<br>
Don't think the leatherworkign stuff is all that's got me pissed, it was just the straw that broke the proverbial camel's back. There's a whole plethora of things i look at and wonder "How in the hell has this not been fixed yet, much less make it through beta untouched" that isn't being rectified. Things like the virtual non-existance on non dagger offhands, which really sucks because of the way weapon specialization and combat potency work. And it would have been SO simple to fix, a rep sword/fist here, one of each for badge turnin. All three of which would have taken 5 min max to do if they reused skins/models which would have been just fine. <br>

Wow, /rant off.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Perhaps you dont transmute?<br>
<br>
For me, with my transmutes on a alt between raids ,instances and plain forgetfulness my transmute timer allways ends up drifting to some time after midnight . then I get a early night and boom back to tranmuteing after work around 6pm.<br>
<br>
<br>
So its not a 1/24 increase its not losing a transmute timer every 1-2 weeks.</div>

I've been transmuting Primal Earth to Water every day now for 6 weeks and the time in which I transmute has changed by one hour. (First thing I do when I get to work)  So yea, I do transmute and knocking the timer back an hour nets me one extra transmute every 24 days.  You can try to justify it all you want but in all actuality knocking the timer down by an hour is pointless.  What would be beneficial would be seperate timers on all transmutable items or perhaps keep it how it is but allow you transmute a stack of something at a time.</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->Clearly then, this change is not intended to help you, or people like you who manage their transmutes with extreme precision. Rather, it is aimed at people who are a touch more casual about it and do it "around" the time the transmute timer is up, as this means we won't suffer from a gradual timer creep as our transmute slips later and later in the day. <br>
I personally thought it was an extremely elegant change: this wasn't meant to vastly improve the quantity of transmutes - as you say, it barely changes the real volume of transmutes going on - but greatly increases the convenince of the system for those who don't care to manage it to within a few minutes every day. Very far from pointless for many people.</div>
