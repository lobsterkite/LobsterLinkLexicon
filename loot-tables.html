				<strong>Thesis: How the loot tables work</strong>
			</div>

		<!-- message -->
		<div id="post_message_507325">In the last couple of days, I was thinking about<br>
<br>
„Why is the loot so often identical?“<br>
„How work the loot table?<br>
<br>
<br>
So in the beginning, I was looking on our own DKP System and compare the loots from identical Bosses. I came to the conclusion: “Whenever Item X drops, Item Y won’t drop!”<br>
<br>
<br>
What does that mean?<br>
<br>
For instance, let us take <b>Rage Winterchill</b>. As everybody know, his loot table contains 12 Items, namely<br>
<br>
Blessed Adamantite Bracers, Blood-stained Pauldrons, Bracers of the Pathfinder, Deadly Cuffs, Furious Shackles, Tracker's Blade, Bracers of Martyrdom, Chronicle of Dark Secrets, Cuffs of Devastation, Howling Wind Bracers, Rejuvenating Bracers, Stillwater Boots<br>
<br>
<br>
I was creating two Item pools, based on our previous Rage Winterchill loots:<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Pool A:</b> Blessed Adamantite Bracers, Blood-stained Pauldrons, Bracers of the Pathfinder, Deadly Cuffs, Furious Shackles, Tracker's Blade<br>
<br>
<b>Pool B:</b> Bracers of Martyrdom, Chronicle of Dark Secrets, Cuffs of Devastation, Howling Wind Bracers, Rejuvenating Bracers, Stillwater Boots<br>
<br>
<br>
As we knew, Rage Winterchill will drop two Items. <br>
<br>
My thesis is: “One Item from Pool A and the other from Pool B will drop!”<br>
<br>
<br>
That means, you can killing Rage Winterchill over million times, but you will never see on a kill, that two Items from the same pool will drop! <br>
<br>
For example: Blessed Adamantite Bracers and Blood-stained Pauldrons. Both will never drop on a Rage Winterchill Kill.<br>
<br>
So I checked my thesis with our own previous Rage Winterchill loots and they corespond to a hundred per cent. A comparison with my thesis and the DKP System from well known Raids (like Nihilum, Last Resort, Forte etc.) shows a match of hundred per cent.<br>
<br>
After that, I created these Item pools for every Black Temple and Hyjal Summit Boss and compared them with our DKP System and with the Drops from the same well known raids, . The result was no deviation from my thesis.<br>
<br>
I hope i’m getting feedback, which make my thesis weatherproof or not!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Following are the item pools for each Black Temple &amp; Hyjal Summit Boss<br>
<br>
<br>
PS: I hope you overlook my bad english, because learning english in school is a long time ago.<br>

<br>
edit: on Gurtogg you have Girdle of Mighty Resolve up twice, one in each pool, intentional?</div>

		<div id="post_message_507509">I realize this is straying from the topic a bit, and of course, it's been discounted a million times, but I'm still convinced that "seeding" is 100% legit and completely broken.<br>
<br>
Typically for our raids I start invites.  Going back to when we started Karazhan, SSC/TK, and even T6 content, we noticed *insanely* obviously streaks in loot.  Basically anytime I started raid invites, we would see the same 4 items per boss.  it was like clockwork.  When another officer would do invites (Trouble, some of you probably know him on these boards)  we would see a distinct shift in loot.   Not much, but some.<br>
<br>
So about a month ago we changed things up.  For 3 weeks, we ran with completely different raid leaders.  Grabbed a random paladin to "seed", had our hunter officer seed, and there was a 3rd who I forget now, probably one of our other shadow priests.<br>
<br>
The difference?  Suddenly after months of seeing the same shit, we started seeing loot tables that were complete flips.<br>
<br>
Examples include...  Seeing 80% defender token drops for the first 3-4 months of farming ssc/tk.  Soon as we switched raid leaders, our mages were praising jebus for finally getting their tokens.<br>
<br>
Azgalor dropped the exactly same loot forever.  Swapped raid leaders, got a ton of new loot.  <br>
<br>
And to reinforce this, for the past 2-3 weeks I've been starting raids again and it went right back into our old loot tables that we used to see 2-3 months ago.<br>
<br>
<br>
So I guess to wrap this up, yes, we see the same thing with items holding a specific loot slot in the table.  But in addition to that, I'm pretty pissed off that the loot system is so fucked up that you end up getting the same shit all the time because they can't figure out a creative way to distribute loot evenly.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The fact that some guilds are working on their *third set* of warglaives, and guilds such as ours, EJ(at least, this is what I've heard), and many others have yet to see a single legendary, is complete bullshit.</div>

</div>Its hard to say how it works in instances, so i wont try to reflect from the following statement to how it works there.<br>
But there are mobs in Blasted Lands called Shadowsworn Adpet's (<a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?npc=6006" target="_blank">Shadowsworn Adept - NPCs - World of Warcraft</a>). They usually run around with a staff in their hands, as you can see on the screenshot of the wowhead link. Now if these mobs will drop any weapon, they will have it equipped already and you can see it in their hands instead of the staff they normally wield. This would lead to believe that, atleast outdoors, mobs will have their loot set once they spawn.<br>

		<div id="post_message_507722">Bacon: yes, a completely equivalent way of looking at it, and probably more in line with what's going on under the hood.<br>
<br>
Opioid: One story comes to mind, from way the hell back in the day (when MC was cutting-edge), was when some raid's boss got tagged by the warrior's shield spike and registered as tagged to about half the raid. The boss was unlootable when killed. They contacted a GM and explained their situation; the GM told them what dropped and let them decide who was supposed to get it.<br>
The boss dropped some vendor trash and maybe a lava core.<br>
It was well-known at that point that there was some way in which bosses would know whether not to drop pally loot, or not to drop shammy loot. This incident led to the conclusion that mob drops are determined no earlier than when the mob is tapped. The spike is neither ally nor horde, so it failed to load either drop table and just had the default trash drops.<br>
<br>
In order to make this jive with the above Table A/B/C stuff above, assume that there are five tables:<br>
Aa: Alliance A<br>
Ah: Horde B<br>
Ba: Alliance B<br>
Bh: Horde B<br>
T: Vendor Trash<br>
Upon tap, or upon death, it looks at who has the tap. In any case, drop T. If alliance, drop Aa and Ba. If horde, drop Ah and Bh.<br>
<br>
Now, this was pre-TBC, and the removal of faction-specific classes may have obviated the need for the coding that led to this scenario. It is entirely up in the air if blizzard would have gutten unnecessary code or left it in and largely nonfuctional.<br>
<br>
My assumption is that mobs determine drops upon death, depending on who currently has the tap. This is my only explanation for the current group-loot mechanics, both in and out of instances; the main example is group-loot this-item-starts-a-quest items, which drop for all people present that do not have the quest, but not for people out of range or who do not have the quest available. The fact that the item did not drop, and is not simply invisible, is clearly detectable on any skinnable mob.</div>

		<div id="post_message_507789">Why would they go through the extra effort of figuring out some convoluted system that would obviously produce badly distributed loot?  The leader of a raid is probably going to be the same from week to week, anyone could see that.  I really don't think there is anything more complicated to it than a random number (or several) between X and Y being generated, these index into loot tables.  Presto, loot.<br>
<br>
And really, if no one, across the millions of people that play wow saw streaks, it wouldn't be random, it would be evenly distributed.  There are all sorts of reasons why you remember streaks and why your brain seeks out patterns.  This is just another one.</div>

How this exactly works inside (raid) instances for mobs that spawn not at the creation time of the instance but later is a bit hazy but those who do those raid dungeon solo farm runs can certainly confirm that newly spawned in mobs do have loot later on. (Also respawned trash, of course)<br>
<br>
I'll try to find the blueposting and will edit this post as soon as I find it.<br>
EDIT: This is the thread: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100927021439/http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=46186572&amp;pageNo=1&amp;sid=1#7" target="_blank">WoW Forums -&gt; Perplexing (Unimportant) Question</a><br>
<br>
Please note that the thread is a bit weird to read. Tseric first said that loot is determined on mob kill, was then asked about the Blasted Lands mobs and later added his "I could be wrong". Then he apparently checked with someone and finally edited his first post clarifiying that loot is determined before it dies. He didn't say it's determined on spawn time but that's what effectively happens.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Nope there isn't. It's a computer generated random number (which we do not know how it is constututed), that eventually determines what loot a mob will yield when killed. And that happens when the mob is spawned, as you can read about in the previous post of me in this thread.<br>

<br>
People often fail to realize that he gave the answer in the second paragraph already. Mobs have loot tables, the loot they drop is therefor not entirely random, meaning something out of all items in the game, but limited to that loot table. That's what he hints at. But people read his statements as if he said there is this magic hidden thingie which we don't tell you that influences what you'll get.<br>
<br>
Loot is randomly selected from the loottable from the specific mob. And randomly selected means using a PRNG which is seeded at some unknown time by some unknown value. If there is truely a way to influence this mechanism as a player, it's most likely only the random seed and there probably only a factor of it and not the seed in its entirety which means in normal speak that it's most likely useless even to try.<br>
<br>
I personally have a deep suspicion that Blizzards' implementation and/or use of the PRNG has some weird bias now and then, but even if I were right, it would *still* be completely random.<br>
<br>
Oh and changing master looter never had any influence at all, because for one, the mobs were already spawned once you're inside the instance and for the other, we tended to raid with FFA where there is no masterloot set at all (which could be viewed as the 26/41th setting of it, though).<br>
<br>
If anything influences the seed or PRNG that is ultimately responsible for your Kael'Thas loot, it happens right when the first person enters the instance and spawns it with all mobs contained.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_508150"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Hmm, if I remember correctly, there have been people reporting that the same bosses dropped different loot after server crashes and rollbacks and when the mob respawned after death (Moroes, Lurker..) due to a bug.<br>
<br>
So "spawn" in this case would mean the actual spawn of the game object (the mob) and not bound to the instance id. This would also mean that a soft-reset, also resets the currently assigned loot, since a soft reset probably frees the server memory and removes the instanced objects, which are newly instanciated when someone enters the dungeon after the reset.<br>
<br>
It makes perfectly sense if you look at it from a programmer's perspective in object oriented programming, so the constructor of the spawning mob could already assign the loot.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

But to comment on your thesis there are 100% definitely loot pools. We had people  from dozens of guilds digging through their dkp/loot trackers and no one could find exceptions to the rule. <br>
<br>
Rare drops(war glaives) are in an additional loot pool and represent an additional loot when they drop. <br>
<br>
Loot inside the pool does not need to have the same chance of dropping (though recent dungeons it seems like they maybe do) Back on nef each pool had 4 20% drops and 2 10% drops, I remember that pretty clearly. <br>

</div>That theory stems from a Something Awful thread ("Ask a WoW GM"). <br>
<br>
As previous posters have stated, killing Moroes twice in the same Kara clear can yield different loots.  Hell, the opera event isn't even determined until you talk to the doorman.  We've wiped intentionally and switched the raid leader just to get a change to a particular event. Loot is either on spawn or death, and really, who cares.<br>

		<div id="post_message_508986"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->No offense, but the discussion on whether loot is generated at instance load, mob spawn, or mob death is all kinda pointless, a la Schrödinger's cat [0]. Unless Blizzard's programmers are complete morons (and learned nothing from EQ or Diablo 2), the loot isn't going to be available to the client until the mob dies. Thus, there will be no WoWView for finding rare spawns or resetting instances to get that coveted rare drop.<br>
<br>
That said, the discussion on mutually exclusive loot (i.e., figuring out the exact loot subtables) is interesting and can actually be figured out with enough statistics from different guilds.<br>

<br>
It worked in one of two ways.  The first was running on the same PC as EQ, the second running as a packet sniffer on a second computer on your local network (In this mode it would read the network traffic sent, decrypt the packets.  Since it was a on a second PC and only reading traffic it wasn't detectable in this mode).<br>
<br>
I tried it out once.  Pretty impressive.  It would display a map of the entire zone you were in.  Since Sony made the mistake of broadcasting _everything_ in the zone to each person in the zone you'd see a dot on the map for every NPC and item.  (Imagine being able to see every herb in SMV without having to move and every rare spawn [and rare spawns that drop good items])<br>
<br>
It also took advantage of a second mistake that Sony made...  NPC drops were precomputed at spawn time and equipped on the NPC model.  You could select an NPC across the zone and it would show you weapons/shields/etc that it would drop.<br>
<br>
These are reasons why WoW only informs your client of NPCs &amp; Items within a short visual range of your character and never shows equipped items on the NPC model.<br>
<br>
<br>
Edit:<br>
W.R.T. loot determination @ npc-spawn or npc-death:  It makes no difference from the client perspective and is impossible to test (You'd need control over the server's random seed @ mob spawn &amp; mob death).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_509066"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->People going crazy to find the "secret sauce" of switching the raid leader, mesuring the moon phase or whatever need to ask themselves this.<br>
<br>
You can get an effectivelly random # by looking at the 1/100ths of second on the computer's clok after you requesting one or simply running a counter as a background process that goes up to 1000, resets and does it again really quickly. Want a random? Call Process(WhatAreYouAtInYourCount). Take the number and use it.<br>
<br>
Or you can go through some insane machination that is the function of a raid leader, the number of paladins dancing in Ironforge, how many AV victories alliance had today or whatever. Nothing makes sense at all except for a variant of the first one.<br>
<br>
The "loot pools" explain a lot about the so-called extraordinary frequency of same drops. If there are only 4-6 items in a loot pool, seeing the same one over and over is hardly exceptional from a chance perspective. If there are two dice in your hand, rolling a pair of 3s doesn't make you go "ZOMG TWO THREES THESE DICE ARE LOADED."<br>
<br>
And while everyone who understands the difficulty with computng truly random numbers has a point about the lack of them, it's irrelevant here. Blizzard doesn't need an exceptionally good random number generation for most loot to remain random. It needs an incredibly basic one. There are so many dice rolls, so many kils, so many everythings... <br>
<br>
The reality is that even if there were a massive bug that resulted in streaky loot, you'd never come remotely close to seeing it. You are simply not privy to enough dice rolls.<br>
<br>
The notion that the game somehow is secretly storing the dice rolls from independent raid IDs (i.e. your previous weeks' raids) and getting "stuck" in giving you the same loot is absurd. Why would they do this? Why wouldn't they simply re-seed the RNG each week with an obscenely simple method of approximate a die or pair of dice in your hand? Well, of course they do the latter.<br>
<br>
Period.<br>
<br>
And everything else is a conspiracy theory of the highest order. When you're researching Schrodinger's cat, take a look at Occam's Razor.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

The percentages are either reset or recharge over time (with say, raid tables being reset much later in the week, blue tables hourly, and green tables say every 15 minutes).  And its not just group or raid-wide, it would be server wide.<br>
<br>
Back before everyone hit 70, you could farm mana's at a reasonable rate in Netherstorm from Kirin'var, but eventually the drops would slow down.  You would almost always get generous streaks of motes of mana from the mana thistle in the zone after this occured, and when that slowed down, the ghosts in Kirin'var would be back up to their original rate (or the mana worms and elementals would have them in generous quantities for a while).<br>
<br>
Motes of Fire?  I don't think their drop rates were really nerfed as much as people think, I believe they are shared with mining nodes, and when BC came out the mining nodes out there were picked clean for weeks as people leveled up their tradeskills.  The first few people in elemnetal plateau got riduculous amounts of fire, which I believe were due to the motes getting pushed off the mining node tables and accumulating onto the fire elmental's tables.<br>
<br>
This would make sense, to promote exploration (spread people out by making the resources more optimal to acquire that way), and as an anti-farming measure.   Farming would work but the drop rates would be reduced.<br>
<br>
I've done a lot of the grind quests on an alt recently, and some of the more hellish ones when BC came out dropped a fair bit faster, which is either due to blizzard tuning the drop rates (possible but I really think they don't bother unless its seriously broken) or less competition for the mobs by players.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

As previous posters have stated, killing Moroes twice in the same Kara clear can yield different loots.  Hell, the opera event isn't even determined until you talk to the doorman.  We've wiped intentionally and switched the raid leader just to get a change to a particular event. Loot is either on spawn or death, and really, who cares.<br>

They will actually drink the winterfall firewaters that are in their inventory after a seemingly random amount of time. This is very easy to see just by letting them spawn and watching them, if they grow, they've used the firewater. If you kill them right when they spawn, the firewater drop rate is significantly better, but if you watch them drink it and then kill them, it will never ever drop (or so was the way I experienced it from my enchanting grind).<br>

Feel free to check out the history on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090705015110/http://www.junglefortress.com/" target="_blank">www.junglefortress.com</a> (look at the DKP link and check through and you tell me if you can find the 3-4 weeks in which our molten core drops were radically different from the rest...)<br>
<br>
I'm not an expert and don't proclaim to be, I can only speak from experience and what I do actually know, which is what I ended my last post with: People will convince themselves of anything.<br>
     If you already KNOW that the same person is seeding the instance and KNOW that this is going to cause the same loot to drop all the time, then you will notice those occurences which support this theory.  Anything outside of your theory flies under your radar because basically you just aren't interested enough (ie. the priests happen to get a rare drop they never had before, but you're a mage who cares).<br>
     When the seed is changed all of a sudden you are actually interested and looking for anything new to drop, and you don't notice the same shit dropping in between.<br>
<br>
It's all been said before, I'm not the first person to come up with this theory and I don't claim to be, but I do enjoy discussions even though I doubt anyone will actually truly believe a thing unless Blizzard fully releases the details of their loot system...<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_510793"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I think the real question on everyone's mind isn't whether the loot is random or not, but if the loot is <i>predictable</i> or not. What raid leader wouldn't kill for the opportunity to know how to get x-drop to happen eh, or know if there was a way to figure out the "randomness" of the system.<br>
<br>
You have drop A, and you have drop B.<br>
<br>
You know when you get drop A drop B must follow, and perhaps a drop C(Non-Tier item), and maybe even drop D(Legendary).<br>
<br>
A-&gt;algorithm-result(B)-&gt;algorithm-result(C)-&gt;algorithm-result(D) the result is based on whatever rules the algorithm makes, if it has to be 1-5, or 1-1,000,000, it'll end up there.<br>
<br>
"<b>The generation of random numbers is too important to be left to chance.</b>" <br>
<br>
That was said, because it's pretty difficult to make a working, and accurate random number generator, that's truly random. Computers take an algorithm, and spit out a random number, the random number is determined by the seed, find out the seed and you can work backwards to figure out what's about to be spit out first. That MIGHT be the only one you can predict, but then the question is when does the random number generator start?<br>
<br>
Is it determined by something simple, like raid make-up? Maybe server time? Does it go on an individual basis, with each person having a shadow number attached that it uses, based on past drops? It gives you a headache when you really start thinking about it, but how complex of an algorithm do you think WoW uses to determine all this crap? <!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I realize this is straying from the topic a bit, and of course, it's been discounted a million times, but I'm still convinced that "seeding" is 100% legit and completely broken.<br>
<br>
Typically for our raids I start invites.  Going back to when we started Karazhan, SSC/TK, and even T6 content, we noticed *insanely* obviously streaks in loot.  Basically anytime I started raid invites, we would see the same 4 items per boss.  it was like clockwork.  When another officer would do invites (Trouble, some of you probably know him on these boards)  we would see a distinct shift in loot.   Not much, but some.<br>
<br>
So about a month ago we changed things up.  For 3 weeks, we ran with completely different raid leaders.  Grabbed a random paladin to "seed", had our hunter officer seed, and there was a 3rd who I forget now, probably one of our other shadow priests.<br>
<br>
The difference?  Suddenly after months of seeing the same shit, we started seeing loot tables that were complete flips.<br>
<br>
Examples include...  Seeing 80% defender token drops for the first 3-4 months of farming ssc/tk.  Soon as we switched raid leaders, our mages were praising jebus for finally getting their tokens.<br>
<br>
Azgalor dropped the exactly same loot forever.  Swapped raid leaders, got a ton of new loot.  <br>
<br>
And to reinforce this, for the past 2-3 weeks I've been starting raids again and it went right back into our old loot tables that we used to see 2-3 months ago.<br>
<br>
<br>
So I guess to wrap this up, yes, we see the same thing with items holding a specific loot slot in the table.  But in addition to that, I'm pretty pissed off that the loot system is so fucked up that you end up getting the same shit all the time because they can't figure out a creative way to distribute loot evenly.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The fact that some guilds are working on their *third set* of warglaives, and guilds such as ours, EJ(at least, this is what I've heard), and many others have yet to see a single legendary, is complete bullshit.</div>

It is human psychology to find patterns in random data that do not in fact exist.  So are you really going to argue that for some reason blizzard tied looting to whoever starts the raid, and that on top of that they rigged it so that this person would be screwed and be more likely to have their raids see the same loot over and over again.  OR, is it more likely that you've simply been unlucky.  It is possible to had someone a die and have them roll a 1 many times in a row without those dice being loaded or rigged.  On top of that, you only see the loot off of a given boss, at most, once a week, which just makes trends like seeing the same loot SEEM much stronger than they probably ARE.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_510892"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->For Blizzard's purposes, their loot is random. There is some guy looking at a database in California and the numbers they see show that it is indeed random. The numbers appear random because they have the numbers for every single boss kill. You can go through the DKP sites of the top 50 guilds in the world and see that some items drop more often than others and claim it's not random. But how many kills is that? Several hundred? A thousand maybe?<br>
<br>
As the sample size gets larger, the numbers come to be more and more of what you'd expect. Are people really so stupid to believe that the Rogue/Mage/Druid token off Illidan drops twice as often as the Paladin/Priest/Warlock? (<a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?npc=22917" target="_blank">Illidan Stormrage - NPCs - World of Warcraft</a>)  Because the sample size is so small, it appears that because your raid leader's wife has a level 37 druid named Illy, that your guild magically gets more Druid tokens. But when you increase the sample size to a thousand times the number of Illidan kills, the loot distribution is much closer to what you'd expect I.E.

				<div style="font-style:italic">I remember another interesting example of outdoor mob's loot coding from level 60. It  deals with the Winterfall Vilage Furbolgs.<br>
<br>
They will actually drink the winterfall firewaters that are in their inventory after a seemingly random amount of time. This is very easy to see just by letting them spawn and watching them, if they grow, they've used the firewater. If you kill them right when they spawn, the firewater drop rate is significantly better, but if you watch them drink it and then kill them, it will never ever drop (or so was the way I experienced it from my enchanting grind).<br>
As far as I'm concerned, it's a very good indicator that loot must be calculated on spawn.</div>

</div>From my exalted grind, I haven't noticed this at all. Firewater is just a really rare drop and I've had it drop from every creature, buffed or not.<br>
<br>
What I have however noticed is that after grouping up a green will drop on the first kill the vast majority of the time. I used to get one every 30 minutes or so but one would always drop after grouping up.<br>
This didn't happen when trying to make it happen (repeating the cycle of grouping, killing, looting, ungrouping) and I haven't seen this behavior since 2.0. But I find it very odd that it happened so often to me.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I don't know why people are convinced that loot went to a 3-table system with the 2.2 change for "3 items to randomly drop".<br>
<br>
My honest guess would be that it's<br>
<br>
Loot Table [A] = [A1,A2,A3...]<br>
Loot Table [b] = [B1,B2,B3...]<br>
<br>
Loot Table ["C"] = [A] whatever the stupid sign is for combination of sets [b], other than the item that had previously dropped.<br>
<br>
For example, with Al'ar this week: Phoenix Ring, Claw of the Phoenix, Talisman of the Sun King. That's A, B, A, for comparison.<br>
<br>
Hydross: Blackfathom Warbands, Band of Vile Aggression, Living Root.<br>
<br>
A,B,A yet again.<br>
<br>
I'm not convinced that they've split the loot tables up into an additional group. Be much easier just to put in code to "reroll if non-token double-drop" and go from there.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
One of the draws with the PVP reward system (both Arena and BG), I am sure, is that it gives the player the power to decide their own reward.  You spent your honor or your Arena points how you see fit and you get the reward you want.  How popular would the Arena be if when you spent your points you got a random item from the vendor?  Not very.<br>
<br>
I think raiding would see a little bit of a resurgence if they would make the reward component of PVE more like PVP.  Set loot tokens are a small step in that direction but I think they should do more.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I remember another interesting example of outdoor mob's loot coding from level 60. It  deals with the Winterfall Vilage Furbolgs.<br>
<br>
They will actually drink the winterfall firewaters that are in their inventory after a seemingly random amount of time. This is very easy to see just by letting them spawn and watching them, if they grow, they've used the firewater. If you kill them right when they spawn, the firewater drop rate is significantly better, but if you watch them drink it and then kill them, it will never ever drop (or so was the way I experienced it from my enchanting grind).<br>
As far as I'm concerned, it's a very good indicator that loot must be calculated on spawn.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>This is just a myth. I killed enough of them during Naxx days to know for a fact that whether or not they drank a firewater potion either before or during combat had absolutely no statistically noticeable effect on whether or not they would drop one. I remembered hearing about it, and after that I paid very close attention, and it was definitely not true.<br>
<br>
This is coming from someone who got honored with Timbermaw ONLY from killing Winterfall mobs (starting at unfriendly when I wanted to get through the cave without ruining my rep at level ~55).<br>
<br>
Trust me, there is absolutely no relation between the mob drinking (or not drinking) a fire water potion and them dropping one.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">That was said, because it's pretty difficult to make a working, and accurate random number generator, that's truly random. Computers take an algorithm, and spit out a random number, the random number is determined by the seed, find out the seed and you can work backwards to figure out what's about to be spit out first. That MIGHT be the only one you can predict, but then the question is when does the random number generator start?<br>
<br>
Is it determined by something simple, like raid make-up? Maybe server time? Does it go on an individual basis, with each person having a shadow number attached that it uses, based on past drops? It gives you a headache when you really start thinking about it, but how complex of an algorithm do you think WoW uses to determine all this crap? </div>

</div>A blueposter long ago said once that they are using IBAA as RNG and each process has its own RNG, sharing it with everyone running on this process. However it may very well be that each instance is its own process and thus you really have your own RNG which gets instantiated when the instance spawns. If there is a problem with seeding at this point, you really can get into some trouble from a statistical viewpoint.<br>
<br>
However I don't know if instances all have their own process and if that is still this way (or that information was accurate in the first place).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

We killed Aran once right as he was sitting down to drink, and his door remained closed.  A GM was unable to open the door and told us our only option was to let the instance soft reset and kill him again, so we came back the next night and did just that.  The loot was different each time.<br>

		<!-- message -->
		<div id="post_message_512023"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->One thing that I've been thinking about are the tails of the probability distributions in WoW. If a mob has, say, a 10% chance to drop the quest item you need, then the probability that you have to kill more than 50 mobs to get that item is 0.9^50 ~= 0.5%. This means that if there are 200 people doing that quest, you can expect one of them to need 50 kills or more to complete it; or put another way, if there are 200 servers each with 50 of the quest mobs, on one of the servers none of the 50 mobs will drop that quest item.<br>
<br>
So I was wondering whether WoW in fact cuts these tails off somehow, or whether for some reason, such as generally high probabilities or the fact that new mobs will spawn to replace those that were killed, such cutting isn't needed. The optimal design is obviously one that needs no extra adjustments as those most likely aren't trivial.<br>
<br>
Of course any answer to this probably can't be much more than speculation.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_512128"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->In terms of things like motes from world mobs, it is at least possible that the drop rate is not entirely fixed.  It is at least possible that it varies by time of day/zone crowding/whatever as a way to control the influx of commodity motes into the economy.   Mobs spawn faster when an area is crowded, right? <br>
<br>
It could also be possible that rather than a "one random item from pool A, one random item from pool B", for some technical reason it instead chooses from predefined "sets" of loot - so rather than a 1/3rd chance of each token, there is instead a 1/9 chance of each unique ordered token pair.   If these tables are done by hand, it is at least _possible_ than some item combinations might be more likely or others impossible.   It would be interesting to do an analysis of dkp sites keeping track of the loot combinations rather than individual loot. <br>
<br>
And for everyone who says that it's not possible, why wouldn't they just use a simpler more reliable method, there's always the ridiculous wi flag story as proof that these things can happen in the morass that is MMO code.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_512295"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I'm perfectly willing to admit that I am pattern matching, or whatever the term is called.  <br>
<br>
With that said though, I think it would be nice if a different loot system was put in to place.<br>
<br>
<br>
Loot is obviously streaky.  I'm sure the reason will never be fully known to us because we don't have access to the code, so whatever.<br>
<br>
The problem I see is that from a player perspective, it is a problem when certain drops simply do not drop.  I realize the world is not perfect, but it would be nice to at least see some sort of effort to try and distribute loot a little more fair.  <br>
<br>
Killing gruul for 4 months and never seeing a shield was infuriating to say the least.  After seeing 1 talon of azshara off tidewalker 4 months ago, we didn't see our 2nd until last week.  <br>
<br>
On the other hand, this has worked to our advantage on some items.  We have 5 or 6 DSTs in guild, we've had close to 10 tsunamis drop (3 of which were destroyed because they dropped pre 2.1 patch and it was complete shit back then).  <br>
<br>
But honestly I would gladly trade the "good" for "equal distribution".<br>
<br>
<br>
It would be interesting if they could make a raid ID last a little longer, such as 3-4 weeks.  And instead of resetting the ID at the end of the week, new bosses spawn with different loot, as it would be able to track what has dropped for the last week, etc.<br>
<br>
Obviously something would need to be figured out with locking yourself to a Raid ID, but I'm sure something could be figured out.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
And I want to belabor this point because somehow this thead is losing it to the "pattern maching" or whatever you wish to call it.<br>
<br>
The above poster correctly noted, the quest item example. If chance of item drop = 1/10 there is a 1 in 200 chances you will have to kill 50 mobs to get the item. <br>
<br>
Somehow people fail to grasp what this tells you: Loot is streaky if it is based on a simple random number generator. And the RNG has no memory whatsoever of what your individual character did before, let alone your raid.<br>
<br>
Example: Eye of Shadow used to be farmed on first demon kill or 100th by people. <br>
Example: You get 5 Dragonspines and 10 Tsunamis, but just 2 Talons (nevermind that 2 Talon's in 4 months is almost certainly within a standard deviation of the precisely "predicted" number of Talons)<br>
Example: Insert whatever drop item you want.<br>
<br>
If an item has a 15% drop -- as a lot of these boss loots probably do given the loot pools -- there is approximately a 20% chance you won't see it in 10 kills. Pause on that for a second. You know it's 1 of 6 drops but in 10 kills you have a *reasonable* chance of not seeing it.<br>
<br>
If it's the desired item off a boss, your raid will have several people go apoplectic over the lack of drop, despite the relatively unexceptional event.<br>
<br>
Oh, and the Raid ID is fairly certainly not the seed for the RNG. You don't want to hand someone information they can back engineer into any sort of data. I'm fairly certain it's milliseconds on a server clock somewhere which does a fantastic job of approximating random, especially for purposes as simplistic as randomizing this tiny number of items without producing a pattern.<br>
<br>
People still believe -- not saying any of you do -- that picking their own lottery numbers gives them a better chance of winning than a quick pick (machine generated one). This is obvious false.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Yes, but it's the same raid ID.  <br>
<br>
The theories I've read on loot seed being determined by time say that the seeding occurs when the first person enters the instance.  If that were true, the loot Aran drops wouldn't vary whether you killed him two hours later or two days later.  <br>
<br>
The fact that we killed Aran twice in the same raid ID and got two different lots of loot proves this theory is false.<br>
<br>
Now, if you want to suggest that the RNG is seeded by the time the monster spawns -- that's a definite possibility, and consistant with what happened here.  But it goes against the general wisdom (or perhaps "wisdom") that the loot seed for an entire instance is set at the start.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

When we came back online, golemagg was alive again and loots have disappeared. We killed him again, and surprise, got exactly same loot. Of course it might have been coincidence, but seemed little too good to be such.<br>
<br>
That would speak on behalf that loots are predetermined by something.</div>

</div>I had a very similar experience.  My guild was just about to down Sulfuron when we got the "Server Restart in 10:00 minutes" message.  We downed Sulfy and looted him before the restart.  When the server came online again, the server had been rolled back and Sulfuron and all his trash was back.  The trash would seem to indicate that a soft reset had occurred and that the raid was loaded from it's last "saved" point (the previous boss kill).<br>
<br>
We got the same exact loot after killing him again.<br>
<br>
While this seems to indicate that loot is generated when a boss is first spawned, I would in no way assume it is indicative of how every mob loot table in the game works.  As many people have mentioned, the Blasted Lands mobs clearly seem to have loot determined on spawn and not death, while Aran seems to not.  Two points that come to mind are:<br>
<br>
- Not all mob loot tables necessarily function in the same way.  The Blasted Lands mob seems to be a fairly unique situation, and not one I would perhaps use to extrapolate how loot is handled game-wide.<br>
<br>
- Loot generation does not necessarily occur exactly the same way it does now as it did in 1.0.<br>
<br>
With all the changes to "under the hood" mechanics (sound, UI/LUA, etc) I would not be surprised if BC instances function differently than the original (or even current) MC.<br>
<br>
Also, please let me add my voice to the chorus that would discourage people from drawing any conclusions based on "streaky" loot they've noticed in their guild.  If every guild in the game had a fairly well-balanced distribution of loot and rarely saw the same drops several weeks in a row, only THEN would we know for sure that the loot generation was not random.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I'm pretty sure the Blasted Lands mob have no different loot table functionality. The fact that they show (or showed, I don't know if it's still the case, it's been a long while since I was last there seeing it for myself) the weapon they are going to drop is pretty much certain only a flag on them, just as the "elite" status is a flag or some of their switchable behavior.<br>

</div>There's no reason not to use the same system. There is a subtle difference though. Back in the old raidinstances, Bossmobs generally did reset/evade back when you wiped. In TBC it seems that almost every boss if not every single one despawns instead and then respawns. This may have been done in order to ensure that the boss-scripts do reset properly and there isn't leaking state or some missing cleanup with messy effects (happened every now and then and still does sometimes). Now if loot is determined on spawn, which it is, respawning a boss does reset his loot, evading him back to start does not.<br>
<br>
So if you one hit everything, you get the loot determined on instance creation. If you don't, you don't. In pre-TBC it didn't matter, as bosses were rarely de/respawned. In TBC, about every mob despawns on wipe. And Hyjal is different as it spawns bosses and waves in after instance creation.<br>
<br>
And as a response to a point made further up: The raidID you are bound to and is displayed in the raidtab is related to the raidgroup (raidleader?) and not time or anything else. If you don't believe this, go kill Gruul, then go kill Magtheridon with the same group and then look what it displays (you should have the same ID for both instances). You can also have the same raid ID week for week, however, the raid ID is not the seed, or at most only a part of it, as it certainly does not cause that you get the same drop every week with the same ID.<br>

</div>If I'd have to write some kinda mechanism for determining random loot for mobs, I'd most likely go with some rand and use unix time plus maybe some other info like raidid/realm name. Tho just unix time guarantees "enough" random loot. Also predetermined loot at spawn seems most likely. I'm sure that there are many raid groups which have killed same boss twice due to server crash, even if one of them has gotten different loot, it will debunk this theory.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>No we wouldn't, because that could still be random. If I rolled a dice and got sixes a thousand times in a row, I would suspect the dice of being loaded, but they might not be.

		<div id="post_message_514760"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->As a more general question about the topic as a whole: Is there a good reason to have unpredictable, random loot at all in a competitive MMO with so many players and a widely variant "need" for certain sorts of items between multiple classes? Is there an aspect to it that can't be better solved by another means?<br>
<br>
I try to think of randomness in other games, and it all has a point. If you look at, say, the damage range of an RTS unit, the randomness is there because a range of damage is easier to rebalance for a wider variety of situations than a constant, set, one-number unit, so it has a purpose. If you look at the random distribution of the shots from a hitscan weapon in a shooter game, it encourages better skill with weapon control overall, even if it does make certain encounters totally luck-based.<br>
<br>
I can't make out any similar useful goal for random loot, though. Even if you just want to keep people playing, its still not the best solution you could come up, because true randomness means some people will benefit a lot more frequently too. Some guilds will get everything they want for the first five, or ten, kills in a row, and that certainly doesn't help retain their longevity as subscribers.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

But you wouldn't get everyone crowding around a corpse waiting for the ML to get rezzed and excitedly speculating about what *might* be on there.<br>
<br>
The flip side to this is of course the irritation that people feel when a boss drops loots that were not what was desired by anyone. I would say a combination of guaranteed loots and randomness is optimal. See: the low number of people complaining after you drop Void Reaver, Kael, Vashj etc.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

That's also how randomness works if a system isn't guaranteed to be random.<br>

If you roll a die 6 times and get one of each number, that's a reasonable result for a random die.<br>

If a hundred thousand people roll that same die 6 times, and get one of each number, something is probably cooked.  Yes, it *could* be random, but the less entropy your results contain, the less likely it is that your result is random.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

But the Diablo II loot system was quite predictable at least in single player. It was simply based on the mobs position when it died.<br>
<br>
As for WoW's loot table for outdoor zones I have long been convinced it gives a bonus to people as they enter new zones.  So many times i have taken alts to a zone they have never been to before and got 2-3  greens in the first few kills or even a blue. You get mostly silk of mobs that should drop mostly wool etc.<br>
<br>
Even recently I needed large quantitiies of thick leather to level LW on alt. So after a moments thought I headed to to Azshara, large quantities of level 45 or so neutral deer. First deer I got skinned for Rugged leather, I killed 5 more deer and got rugged leather from them all. I checked wowhead. 75% thick leather 25% rugged leather according to them. After 9 kills I got my first Thick leather. By the time I had filled 2 bags with meat/greys/leather I had more thick leather then rugged. Oh and I got a boe blue from the 3rd mob.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I believe that we've gotten Talon of Al'ar on every kill - multiple months and it has dropped every time. Seeing garbage like that, or like the PvP rings from SSC/TK, drop instead of real loot is disheartening.<br>
<br>
The loot tables almost certainly could use some serious revamping by this point. With PvP and now heroic badges providing literally pick and choose loot, there's no excuse for every single PvE item being completely random. Sure, keep things like the Warglaives on a drop system, but the fact that we've gotten four pieces of tank loot and shard/offspec 30%+ of our loot from SSC/TK points to something being wrong. (For that matter, I'm still using a blue necklace that I got on the ring where I dinged exalted with Cenarion Expedition because in my ridiculous number of maiden kills, I have never seen the necklace.)<br>
<br>
Some things belong on RNG, other things do not, and right now we have entirely too much that does not belong on the RNG being rolled on.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_514844"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->What confuses me is the logic behind this system of pools for raid bosses. What is the advantage of having a system pick two numbers between 1/6, each corresponding to a pool instead of having a system pick two numbers between 1/12. In the second scenario, any two items can be chosen at random (depending on the "randomness" of the generator) instead of having the first chosen item drastically effect the second item.<br>
<br>
If item1/pool1 is chosen, items2-6/pool1 can not be chosen but items1-6/pool2 can be. Under a truly random system, item1 comes on the first roll then any item2-12 can come on the second roll.<br>
<br>
The only advantage would be to split up the pools according to DPS/healing/tanking. I see that, as far as the OP's lists, that is the general pattern. The problem is that it is only a general pattern and the pattern varies. Some are DPS/healing with tank gear thrown in. Some are melee DPS/caster DPS with healing and tanking thrown in.<br>
<br>
What advantage does the system hold if it's pattern is quickly broken on the next boss?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Which is why they adopted it into WoW. The whole [ilvl to mlvl and clvl]* system is very good and allows for lots of customization. Items with random stats - greens and blues from Outland-rarespawns - follow strict rules embedded in this system while customized items, i.e. pvp/quest-items and instance-blues/purples, are made by the itemization team and thereby placed accordingly without regards for the system, but rather where they fit according to progress/power.<br>
<br>
<br>
<i>* D2-terms<br>
ilvl = item level; clvl = character level required to use it; mlvl =mob/monster level required for it to appear on the table</i><br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I'd say it adds suspense, to a certain point. If you know what you're getting no one's too excited about it one way or another, though the recipients may very well be pleased. But you wouldn't get everyone crowding around a corpse waiting for the ML to get rezzed and excitedly speculating about what *might* be on there.<br>
<br>
The flip side to this is of course the irritation that people feel when a boss drops loots that were not what was desired by anyone. I would say a combination of guaranteed loots and randomness is optimal. See: the low number of people complaining after you drop Void Reaver, Kael, Vashj etc.</div>

</div>On the other hand.. the Wi Flag made sense.  It was just a stupid math error, linked with the  fact that characters tended to be processed in a standard order.  The writeup, from srand, the developer who finally found it had the math making it clear.  It was the sort of error I could see doing myself. <br>
<br>
(Monster target selection was pick a person, with a chance inversely proportional to the distance the person was from the monster. So most of the time, the foe should pick the person next to  them. But randomly, it was permitted to run after someone further away.)<br>

				The bug with the Wi flag was incredibly hard to find.<br>
<br>
Apparently the person's character ID number was used in some sort of target selection table and rather than the number of people in the room and distance from the MOB being set to a number from 0-1, based on range, it was somehow being ADDED, so the total would very likely be greater than 1, which it shouldn't have been, and what made that so hard was that some people had no chance of being selected as a target by the MOB, (they came in above the 1 mark which wasn't considered) while others, thanks to their character's ID number, were always in the 0-1 range, and unusually likely to be chosen as a target.<br>
<br>
Poor Wi seemed to always be selected over his compatriots, and wailed upon by said MOB.<br>
<br>
Srand finally tracked down the bug and fixed it in one of those epiphanous "AHA!" moments, and thus the Wi Flag was exorcised from AC forever.<br>
<br>
By the way, I think I still have my official "Wi Flag" card somewhere.

</div>(So basically, you had a 1 roll table created on monster spawn. (Person A (far) = 1%, person B (middling)= 10%, person C (close) = 50%, ..... Person Q = 5%. Total sum= 100%) Roll a number from 0..99%, find who was picked..... Unfortunately, the table summed up to something like 800%, so the actually chances used was  (Person A = 8%, person B = 80%, Person C = 12%, person D..Q = 0%)  And people were just roughly processed by some sort of usernumber. So Person A  with a low number tended to be at the start while Person Z with a high one, tended to the end.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I have long believed this is a great idea that will never happen -- and probably shouldn't happen.<br>
<br>
Who's to say what the group really is that has the "loot string"? Is it the guild? A preponderence of the guild? What?<br>
<br>
It introduces some complexity in "loot memory" and really would please many people. The problem is getting it right, determining when you are finally going to "get something" and worrying about exploiting. If a guild knows it hasn't gotten Superdeluxe Item XYZ for 12 weeks and it's going, it could sell the right to be there... <br>
<br>
Is this worse than what goes one? I guess not. <br>
<br>
But it does make for attendance issues and so many problems.<br>

		<div id="post_message_516918"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->the problem with implementing loot memory is simple. a) it would lead to abuse and b) whose loot memory do you choose?<br>
<br>
Example: We have up to 3 kara Ids in a week, 1 the next week, then 2, whatever. I may not have an Id this week, yet be raidleader next week. Someone from id1@week1 maybe 0@2 and then 2@3. And another member was in 1@2, but also 2@2 with a twink.<br>
<br>
Do you take my memory, or those of the other one? Or those of the twink? or what?<br>
<br>
<br>
Not to mention that this would lead to situations where you could predict and sell the drops with increasing chance of success.<br>
Hey, DST has not dropped for 3 weeks, this week it will drop. Hmm, should I take rogue1  my good buddy, or should I take along the upstart enhance shaman with more DKP? Hmm, let me see...<br>
<br>
Even better, if this was implemented and had not added at least some random element into it anyway, you could be able to MULTIPLY the drops of the specific items. You have 20 people which can force a DST drop, you can sell those IDs to other people.

		<div id="post_message_516947"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Simple solution would be to have the raid ID stay for more than one week. Say you are tied to a raid ID for 4 weeks, but once a week everything in there respawns. This would more or less kill some PUG groups in Karazhan, but keeping loot in memory would be no problem.<br>
<br>
After the 4 weeks, the LDS could reset, this allows for atleast some more varied loot. Not sure how this LDS systsem works, but it makes sense every drop should be able to come each week, but chance decreases if it has already dropped during that 4 week period. It would still be quite likely to get 2 of the same item during the same 4 week period, but chances for getting 3 or 4 would be close to zero (still possible though). This makes it hard to guess what will drop, just you can have some guess of what will not drop.<br>
<br>
I don't see how this will cause any more attendance issues than today. If you know that X is not likely to drop, it would mean the same as you already got the item today and not coming cause of that.

		<div id="post_message_517347"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->And then we have another problem. *Your* raid doesn't want to see an item drop 3x in a row because you lack people that use swords/cloth pants that weren't tailored/wands/whatever who care.<br>
<br>
*Their* raid craves the item 3x in a row because they have no tailors/everyone wants fist weapons/whatever. <br>
<br>
Now are we supposed to pre-program the loot "winnower" to meet the needs of each guild. In Kara it's readily apparent this idea wouldn't even get a nanosecond of consideration from Blizzard (ditto ZA I'd guess). Distributing all the loot from the table isn't particualrly useful for a 10-man nor is denying the raid the same drop more than once.<br>
<br>
In a 25-man it's more pleasing but unless they weight the drops to meet your needs, it's still fairly unpleasing. About the only way this could work is if there were a currency dropped by bosses that could (a) be turned into the items over time -- a guarantee of achieving the items evenutally or (b) some way of using the currency to turn Item X into Item Y when you have enough of it. I don't really like any of these ideas even as a write them.<br>
<br>
And let me be clear, I want "my turn" to come up as much as the next guy instead of waiting 6 weeks for the right pants token to drop or whatever. I want the game to remember that we never got XYZ and give it to us. I just can't see how it's going to do this in a useful, agreeable manner such that people actually prefer it to the existing system.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Well, see your problem is not loot randomization necessarily. It's possible that the proportions should be altered so that oddball niche loot is less common than more uniformly desirable loot.<br>
<br>
I personally wouldn't mind everything being tokenized but under many dkp systems unaltered, that would basically lead to "he with the most points gets everything first". Those problems are far bigger than bad luck loot streaks, from my experience.<br>
<br>
Shrunken loot tables is also reasonable, especially if serendipity is still preserved by the "third drop" off a boss where the oddball loot might come from a somewhat longer table.<br>
<br>
That said, your opinions and Blizzard's about loot is obviously different with the generic you often having a much better idea about what's interesting. I mean we've all seen for 2 years epic boss drops that are just not appealing. And yet a Blizzard itemizer thought they were.<br>
<br>
Would you want Vendorstrike to be one of only 4 drops off the boss?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I agree, though it depends on how the guild handles loot. If bosses drop 2-3 "marks" instead of actual items, then the marks are redeemed at a vendor on 1:1 price for the conventional armor pieces there would be no problem with not getting the right items. Then it would come down to the guild saying you can only get 1 mark per boss and the top 3 people in DKP get a mark. I could see it working but it is much more dependent on effective loot management in guild.  <br>
<br>
However, problems arise such as voids. Crappy loot funds enchants, and if you get no crappy loot until everyone has everything they could possibly need from that boss then that shiny new staff may be shy a Sunfire until 150-200 (assuming crystal prices increased) g for the mats on top of what isn't acquired in raids like the ungodly amount of LP shards needed for high end enchants.<br>
<br>
I see the current loot system as very annoying and could face improvements but they shouldn't be too much. If it is entirely redesigned in to a token system, we'd end up dealing with many more flaws then the current system has. It's the lesser evil but random loot is still a pain.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>My suggestion to this would be to basically keep the t4+ token system, but <br>
a) more tokens! Especially Kara is so annoying as that you most likely won't have one of each class and spec, hell it's not even remotely possible (*moan* Grasp of the Dead *moan*)<br>
or<br>
b) being able to trade them in for an additional "fee" - so all your warriors/druid/priests already got their glove token and it drops again? give it to a shaman and he has to pay some voids (or whatever) to trade it in for the Shammy token. This would counteract the absolute abundance of  having to AH your Voids after a certain point as you don't get enough upgrades to reapply Soulfrost/Sunfire/Mongoose. And I suppose many of the people unlucky with drops would be quite thankful to be able to trade that 10 Kara items they saw drop and be disenchanted repeatedly to trade in for their loot, although it may cost a bit. At least I would have done it all the time.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_519231"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->The loot distribution system is most of the problem, but it's not all of the problem, and not necessarily even the best way to go about solving it. The fact that there is shitty loot on the drop table in the first place is a problem, as is the fact that certain drops are definitely more desirable than others. Sharding your tenth breastplate of annihilation is aggravating, but sharding your very first vendorstrike says it shouldn't be on the loot table in the first place. It's similarly out of line that there are no upgrades for DST, or even nelth's tear, for a long-ass time.<br>
<br>
To an extent, there's also the issue of certain items being very specialist pieces of gear, so you need them to drop some but not much. Having better itemization, and class mechanics that allow for better itemization, can account for a lot. For example, the change to druid mechanics making them favor agi and have no preference for str vs ap means they now share the same dps itemization with rogues--this eliminates the need for specialist str leather, allowing them to tighten up the loot tables a bit.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_524295"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Interesting read regarding percieved streaks written by Shermer, M. about a study conducted by Tversky, Amos in 1985 of 'hot streaks' in pro basketball.<br>
<br>
In fact, what [the researchers] found is so counterintuitive that it is jarring: the number of streaks(successful baskets in sequence) did not exceed the predictions of a statistical coin-flip model. If you conduct a coin-flip experiment and record heads or tails, you will shortly encounter streaks. On average and in the long run, you will flip five heads or tails in a row once every 32 sequences of five tosses. Because Tverky was dealing with pro basketball players, however, adjustments in the formula were made to account for ability. If a player's shooting percentage is 60 percent, for example, chance dictactes that he will sink six baskets in a row once every 20 sequences of six shots attempted. When average shooting percentage was controlled for, Tversky found that there were no shooting sequences beyond what was indicated by chance. Players might feel "hot" or "in flow" when they have games that fall into the high range of chance, but science shows that nothing happens beyond what probability says should happen.<br>
<br>
So if even the guys making millions buy in to the belief that they are lucky or not lucky, it's no surprise gamers experience the same feelings. Basic need to recognize pattern is at the heart of it.<br>
<br>
For any true sports fans out there, a similar study was done regarding Joe DiMaggio's 56 game hitting streak and it was so many standard deviations away from the mean that, as physicist Ed Purcell put, it "should not have happened at all." The more you know.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I had a very similar experience.  My guild was just about to down Sulfuron when we got the "Server Restart in 10:00 minutes" message.  We downed Sulfy and looted him before the restart.  When the server came online again, the server had been rolled back and Sulfuron and all his trash was back.  The trash would seem to indicate that a soft reset had occurred and that the raid was loaded from it's last "saved" point (the previous boss kill).<br>
<br>
We got the same exact loot after killing him again.<br>
<br>
While this seems to indicate that loot is generated when a boss is first spawned, I would in no way assume it is indicative of how every mob loot table in the game works.  As many people have mentioned, the Blasted Lands mobs clearly seem to have loot determined on spawn and not death, while Aran seems to not.</div>

</div>(just my theory)<br>
At the time the first person enteres a raid (ID) instance, most mobs and bosses get spawned (some bosses are random (opera, ZG) aren't visible and maybe they are spawned later when you trigger something, but at the end it doesn't make a difference if they are spawned upon entering instance or when you talk to an npc.) <br>
Every spawned boss gets his own little ID wich saves his status (alive/already killed), loot and some other things wich you should not be able to change with soft-resetting the instance (rnd bosses like opera (wich one you get) in KZ, nefarian adds, chromaggus breaths, ...).<br>
Maybe not the loot for the bosses is saved but there is a reliable formula wich determines the loot by the bosses id and always determins the same loot with the same boss id, like it determines the same bosses abilities when the boss id is the same.<br>
<br>
What happened at Sulfuron? There was complete rollback wich rolled back the save data of the instance ID and the loot in the peoples bags. And a soft reset happened, so the boss was alive again with the same boss id that he had before the rollback and wich was generated when the instance id was generated. So the loot of this boss was the same again. (Although it also could be luck)<br>
At Aran was just the bug, that he didn't got an ID and wasn't saved in the instance. He was handled like a normal trashmob. That's also why the trash normally related to aran also respawned after a soft reset when you had this bug.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Solutions for bad loots/luck from bosses?</b><br>
There are a lot of possibilities but you have to be very careful that there is still some surprise with loot so people not just farm some sort of marks from the bosses and that the system cann't be exploited.<br>
E. g. A system wich prevents mail armor dropps when there are no Hunters/Shamans in the raid, can easily be exploited with bringing only cloth and plate classes to a certain booss to enforce specific loot. (10 man raid instances)<br>
<br>
However, I think there are some solutions possible:<br>
-Removing bad items and duplicate items(e. g. in KZ there are 3 different cloth spell dmg shoes) from the tables and shrink them.<br>
-Increase the dropchances for every item so that series of 20 or 30 weeks where a specific item doesn't drop, gets much more unlikely (there will always be a small chance that an item doesn't drop in 100 runs even when drop chance is 90%)<br>
-Shared loot tables between several bosses (similar to opera event or most trash in raid instances).<br>
-A possibility to exchange unneeded loot to not dropping loot. E. g. a npc in every instance where you get 1 mark for every dropped epic you sell him. 4 such marks together with another mark wich dropps from the endboss you can exchange for an item you wan't but doesn't dropp. (Maybe exclude somt items like mounts, enchants, other endboss dropps)<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I see this crop up quite a fewtimes, and I wonder - how exactly are you tying the frequency of drops per week to anyone? If it's per raid force - well, my raid force changes every week. There's always some people sitting out a week, some on holiday etc.<br>
If it's tied to a specific guild -  what about guilds that run multiple instances? (My Karazhan groups have never had the Lightning Capacitator drop ever. The other Kara team had it drop multiple times).<br>
<br>
There's nothing persistent about raid forces between weeks in WoW, so trying to change the drop tables week after week is never ging to work. The best you can do is implement the system they recently started in EQ2, wherebye if you have already have specific items on classes in the zone, then those items won't drop any more. (At least, I think this is how it works).<br>
<br>
There's no facility or mechanism that could realisticaly be implemented in WoW that would allow any form of dynamic raid tracking to ensure that over time each guild gets the average set of drops.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Yes, but it's the same raid ID.  <br>
<br>
The theories I've read on loot seed being determined by time say that the seeding occurs when the first person enters the instance.  If that were true, the loot Aran drops wouldn't vary whether you killed him two hours later or two days later.  <br>
<br>
The fact that we killed Aran twice in the same raid ID and got two different lots of loot proves this theory is false.<br>
<br>
Now, if you want to suggest that the RNG is seeded by the time the monster spawns -- that's a definite possibility, and consistant with what happened here.  But it goes against the general wisdom (or perhaps "wisdom") that the loot seed for an entire instance is set at the start.</div>

</div>You're making the assumption that the loot seed is based on raid ID.  this is not what the theory says.<br>
<br>
the theory is that the loot tables are determined as soon as the mobs spawn.  it's what determines the loot tables that is in question.  when you killed aran, and then "respawned" him, that didn't prove the theory wrong.<br>
<br>
if the raid ID does not determine the loot tables, then of course you'll get different loot.  but that doesn't mean that the tables weren't chosen when he was spawned.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>You can just make the players saved in the same instance for 4 weeks instead, then have all bosses respawn once a week.<br>
<br>
Another way is to to have like "raid ID", if more than half of the player who enter the instance at the first time was the same as last week. The raid ID will be the same and certain loot will have smaller/higher chance to drop. Of course this can easily be exploited, but what would the point be?

		<div id="post_message_526483"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I dont see any need for a complicated Raid ID system at all really.  I think they did the drops things right in AQ40 with each of the set piece dropping bosses dropping a possible piece for every class every kill and weapons being shared drops across the zone with higher chances on later bosses.  I still dont understand why the stupid tokens for tier pieces can't just be shared for all classes so people dont get vast differences in class gearing because defender never drops for raid X while Hero never drops for raid Y.  Weapons should be something similar to tokens so the raids e.g. dont end up with 5 2H drops for the one dps warrior in the raid and most of the casters still using pvp weapons and hunters using their prince bow...<br>
<br>
They do this right in PvP and they did this mostly right in AQ40, not sure why they went away from the model for rest of PvE.  It is fine for early bosses to have their random loot drops but at least for tier pieces and weapons there needs to be a more non random system introduced.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_527013"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->You guys have done a good job of showing what is indeed a bit broken. It really doesn't make sense that someone needs to spend &gt;5 months in the same raid instance. It was "soul draining" back in the Molten Core days and perhaps the only thing worse was repeating it again in BWL. I think Raiste may be onto something very intriguing, however, although I'm not sure his idea goes far enough.<br>
<br>
For argument's sake, let's presume it takes &gt;15 weeks to beat an instance entirely and kill the end boss once (or a small handful of times). This would be an average of 2 1/2 weeks per boss and in an instance like SSC, I'm not sure it's a terrible estimate. Yes, the Nihilum's of the world (and the EJ's and many of you) can do it faster, but figuring on an average of 1 1/2 weeks for the first 5 bosses and 4-6 weeks for Vashj is not so awful a guesstimate.<br>
<br>
Now, in a world where that represented some kind of endgame, you'd kill Vashj 12-14 times to get all the set gear from her. It's a bad example with Vashj because of the relatively easy progression in Hyjal/BT's early sections but bear with it. Once upon a time, we all accepted the mechanic I'm describing as "part of WoW". So if it was 16 weeks to first Vashj kill and 14 weeks to farm her to death for set pieces, you'd be at 30 weeks for the instance or ~7 1/2 months.<br>
<br>
Essentially, based on the math above off of Vashj you'd have seen the 15% drop item with a 90% certainty once and if the dice played kind with you, you'd have seend it twice in most cases (non-lumpy distribution). But 7 1/2 months is a WoW anachronism for hanging out in the same place absent there being no place else to go. <br>
<br>
To this end, chest pieces that drop before end bosses -- and helms for that matter based on the TBC model of 2 instances = 1 tier -- make an awful lot of sense. Guilds that are now in SSC and TK are going to kill Vashj/Kael even less than those that came before as they try to play catch up. There's a guild on our server that just got Kael after 9 weeks. It means they have an exceptionally high number of Vashj kills (10 already?) and are attuning a few new recruits and killing Kael at least a few more times. But I doubt they get past 6 Kael kills and I doubt anyone on our server really does.<br>
<br>
Given the "pyramid model" of boss kills -- Lurker dies a lot to Guild UberLeet but Vashj dies relatively rarely -- maybe the loot tables should also pyramid. Put a lot of the quirky stuff on Lurker who has a relatively long loot table and put a shorter table on Vashj. In fact, maybe Vashj drops 3 tokens and 2 items that are from a not-particularly-long list of particularly wonderful items. You want them all? You're gonna have to farm her. But with the 3 tokens, you are looking at a rough maximum of 9 weeks for your first 27 to get helms (the 3 tokens are simply one of each... you've beaten the big boss, the big boss is stocked like a Nordstroms with all the goods). <br>
<br>
I'm not sure it would be so awful to have this bottom up approach to loot. Cross class items sit on the bottom bosses where you are getting in a lot of kills, increasingly the likelihood of the loot dropping not just once but a few times. <br>
<br>
A few of the "Qiraji Armaments" mechanisms would hardly be tragic as well as it worked pretty darned well in AQ40 I though. If it means the ridiculous off-spec/PVP/hybrid item that really can't be used by many people is replaced by a token that can be used for 1 of 5 items ensuring it's definitely useful, then all the better.<br>
<br>
But a system that acknowledges how often the bosses are actually killed might help a bunch. And when you decide to stop killing the end boss, you at least walked away with set pieces if not all the items on the table.<br>
<br>
Note that the better loot is, the shorter in supply void crystals will be and Blizzard ought to keep that in mind with any change to "better loot". Today, voids are a joke of course -- we got 30 in Karazhan the other night -- but if the first 6-8 weeks of loot in Lich King are all useful and there is no way to enchant things, well boo. I'd propose that enchanting has a "make me into something better or worse' as a matter of course in Lich King anyway. In other words, keep the Nexus --&gt; Small Pris --&gt; Large Pris mechanic in place for whatever the future holds but also include voids. So today, 3 large pris --&gt; void. Yes, I know that's ridiculously expensive today, but that's not the point.<br>
<br>
When TBC was new, voids were rare but prismatics flowed like water from all the 5-manning. If 3 prismatics could be made into a void, it'd be a nice perk for enchanters to do something else useful and also mean that Karazhan loot -- which if you all recall sucked incredibly badly at the beginning -- could've been enchanted without some of it reqiring disenchanting.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>The problem is in convincing Blizzard that this is a good idea.<br>
<br>
According to Blizzard loot tables:<br>
* There must be 6 items per loot table (with rare exceptions). Tokens count as 2 items and a quest reward drop counts as 6. Legendaries exist in a loot table with a lot of blank spaces.<br>
* An end boss will have 1 more loot table than any other boss in the zone, or 2 if one of the extra tables contains a legendary or a quest drop.<br>
* Loot from an end boss must be about 1 tier more powerful than any other loot in the zone.<br>
* There should be rarer drops that give players a reason to keep coming back to the zone.<br>
<br>
The first 3 of those guidelines are derived from observing the loot tables themselves. The last guideline is based on CM/Dev comments of the past. Given those guidelines, what changes do you make that aren't negative to players?<br>
<br>
If you take an item off each end-boss loot table to increase the drop rate of each of the remaining items, then some players will miss out on a nice item for their class to give the rest of the players a better chance. While you have to clear the zone fewer times to get all the "good" drops, that's because there are simply fewer good drops to be had.<br>
<br>
A better option would be to take 2 items of each end-boss loot table and make a 3rd table. That would be great for players because you still have all the possible loots and they are dropping far more often. You could even make the third table a "single player quest starter drop" with known rewards. There may be some reluctance on the Blizzard side of things to give an extra loot per kill, but in the grand scheme of a zone, it doesn't really seem that terrible. It's important to note that you really wouldn't want to do this on the current final boss of a zone. It's only something you'd do when the next zone is released to encourage players to keep coming back a few more times rather than just dropping the zone completely.<br>
<br>
That being said, the problem then becomes rare drops from earlier mobs that are just very well itemized and/or highly desirable. At some point, the players themselves have to realize that not every item is going to drop enough times to supply every player that wants one.<br>
<br>
On a side note, the reason why Void Crystals are so undesirable at the moment has very little to do with the numbers dropping and a lot to do with their utility relative to Large Prismatic Shards. Void Crystals are used in 4 rare weapon enchants, an enchanter only ring enchant, the Surefooted enchant (which nobody really uses because it's simply not as good as the alternatives) and shadow resist gear. You only need the shadow resist gear once per character, so it has a very small impact. The enchants all take equal or larger amounts of LPS. LPS is also used in a huge variety of other enchants. So basically you use your Void Crystals in weapon enchants and nowhere else repeatably. Arguably, Void Crystals need a repeatable use to soak up the excess numbers there are. Whether that's a recipe to turn them into 3 LPS (and wouldn't that make the value skyrocket!) or a new temporary buff item that uses them, it would all help to make Void Crystals more useful.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

This is coming from someone who got honored with Timbermaw ONLY from killing Winterfall mobs (starting at unfriendly when I wanted to get through the cave without ruining my rep at level ~55).<br>

</div>You two actually made me go and check this, sweet jesus.<br>
<br>
My sample size is only about 100 mobs, and I really don't care enough to go any further.<br>
<br>
When you mind control them, the firewater is on the pet bar. You can also (obivously) see the firewater buff if they have it on. If they don't have the buff on, you can use the firewater on the pet bar, and they gain the buff.<br>
If you dispell them, and then mind control them, and try to use the firewater after they have used it, it won't let you. It says it is not ready no matter how long you wait.<br>
<br>
The ONLY ones I got firewaters off of were the mobs that I could not dispell (who were not buffed), and High Chief Winterfal. When you mind control High Chief Winterfal, he has 3 abilites, but no firewater to drink. And surprise surprise, he drops the firewater almost every time when you kill him because he can't use it.<br>
<br>
I sat around and waited for some to spawn and insta gibed them before they could do anything and the firewater drop rate was 7 out of 8.<br>
<br>
I could be wrong and just had extremely coincidental rates just now, but empirically, every condition I originally stated is true as far as I can tell.<br>
<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">On a related topic, why is PVE loot so...random?  Because its always been that way?  Is that the way it always should be?<br>
<br>
One of the draws with the PVP reward system (both Arena and BG), I am sure, is that it gives the player the power to decide their own reward.  You spent your honor or your Arena points how you see fit and you get the reward you want.  How popular would the Arena be if when you spent your points you got a random item from the vendor?  Not very.<br>
<br>
I think raiding would see a little bit of a resurgence if they would make the reward component of PVE more like PVP.  Set loot tokens are a small step in that direction but I think they should do more.</div>

		<div id="post_message_528510"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Ive only heard heresay of double-spawned bosses occuring, such as 2 Nefarians in the same instance Pre-TBC, but im wondering if theres any record of this having happened and said bosses being killed. In this sense the player influenced events, such as RaidID, time of first player entering the instance and raid leader would be identical and show that loot isnt predictable simply from one of these factors.<br>
<br>
Its strange though how the Blasted Land mobs seem to be the only ones in game to wear their loot as if it were predetermined. I guess though it would be possible to have variants of the mob for a few weapon types, or something that says for example spawn it with Weapon Skin #10001 and loot table #704.<br>
<br>
From a programming/data point of view, is the concept of the server creating and remembering a specific drop for every mob in every zone on the server at spawn time, aswell as all the mobs in an instance when it is created not somewhat inefficient, as many of the mobs may never even be killed. Even as the small amount of data to store upto say 6 item codes, it would seem more sensible just to store the id of a corresponding loot table.<br>
<br>
Im much more comfortable with the idea that a boss is spawned with limited data, an ID to draw his appearance/behavior/scripting from, location, and the ID of his loot table. The loot table would be the list of the 6 pools of things he can drop. Then on his death, the loot is randomly (seeded by time of kill and whatever else,) selected from the pools and hes looted.<br>
<br>
The pumpkin bag in naxx, several days after halloween is interesting though, but i guess its also possible that that mob was somehow flagged for halloween special loot, or created and linked to a loot table containing the pumpkin bag. <br>
<br>
Its a massive amount of speculation really, as we dont know when/if things behind the loot system changes, nor do i believe if we could ever proove that the loot is selected at spawn time, or if the mob is just linked to its loot pools at that time, for selection upon death.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Well every spawned mob needs to have some data anyway, such as location, type (shared spawn points), FSM-state, current health, probably an empty threat list, timers, etc. Aditional 0 to 10 itemids are not going to kill you there memory wise. And from a performance view: You really get killed if you allocate/deallocate lots of memory continously. It is in general better to allocate once and not change it. Allocating / deallocating memory is a rather costly operation.<br>
<br>
But just for fun, let's say one drop is 2 32bit ints (one for the ID and one for count) and we have a maximum of 10 drops per mob. That's 640 bits or 80 Bytes per mob maximum. 1000 mobs thus require ~80KBytes of memory. That's in todays day and age of GB's really no problem at all.<br>
<br>
Now I have no clue how many mobs are on a given world server, but I guess somewhere below 10'000, so that's less than 800KBytes and thus less than 1 MB memory required for all the loot in the mobs. Really no problem there.<br>

</div>Well, that's been beaten to death. Loot is determined on spawn. We have the Blasted Lands mobs, we have blue confirmation and it would be really stupid to have several loot generating mechanisms instead of just one.<br>
<br>
What happens on kill time is that the loot becomes "materialized" if you can say that for virtual items, and also at this time if it is a boss mob, logs it somewhere. Or rather, it's logged in any case, as that top-list feature on the official website demonstrates, they log that stuff anyway.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

In this sense the player influenced events, such as RaidID, time of first player entering the instance and raid leader would be identical and show that loot isnt predictable simply from one of these factors..</div>

</div>It isn't any of those factors. There have been multiple spawns of many bosses with different loot.<br>
<br>
The nutcases all then claim "those bosses didn't spawn with the instance" but others do. Then they argue its still based on Raid ID or some other gibberish.<br>
<br>
Even if it were based on these things -- and it isn't -- you can't control the Raid ID. You can't enter the instance at a precise fraction of a second etc. The notion that it's set by the raid leader is the most idiotic of them all. Why doesn't the raid leader get the same loot every week from every boss? Then we here it's the raid leader plus some interaction effect with the time. Alas, we still can't control the time.<br>
<br>
People need to stop believing they influence random events. It makes them sound stupid or insane or both. And people need to stop worrying about controlling the mythical "seed" because we've all seen the same loot from the same boss. And yet we've almost never seen all the same loot from every single boss. Nor have we ever had a boss that drops the same exact loot every time through an instance's history with our guilds.<br>
<br>
Stop looking for something in the tea leaves that isn't there.<br>
<br>
Loot is random. Stating that computers can't make "true random numbers" in no way changes this fact.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">A blueposter long ago said once that they are using IBAA as RNG and each process has its own RNG, sharing it with everyone running on this process. However it may very well be that each instance is its own process and thus you really have your own RNG which gets instantiated when the instance spawns. If there is a problem with seeding at this point, you really can get into some trouble from a statistical viewpoint.</div>

</div>I'm aware that I'm stepping on shaky ground with mere anecdotal reference and conjecture, but I can't remember ever being kicked/disconnected out of an instance without everybody else on our realm being kicked/DCed as well -- unless it's based on connection issues on my side, obviously. To me, this leads to the conjecture that most likely, instances share a common process, since by now, I'd expect to have seen a process crash vs. a full instance server crash. <br>
<br>
Also, it seems to me that it's just good design to have everything that needs random numbers to sip them from a common pool, especially in a case like WoW. Because, as you have pointed out indirectly, the more different sources tap into the RNG pool for different purposes, the less important it actually gets how random your numbers really are -- because the sequence of random number requests is random in itself, depending on hundreds of players hitting buttons on their keyboards, client-server lag, etc. To me, this sounds almost as good a RNG source as the proverbial RNG box that monitors radioactive decay. <!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_530869"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->My working “on spawn” theory involves a MobID field.  I use to be an application modeler for VB applications a few years ago and each mob having its own unique ID tag seems normal to me.  I would also not be surprised if “on spawn” the MobID was given a property that contained a RND that correlated to predetermined loot table positions.<br>
<br>
For example, when Ragnaros #56745 spawns he is given a LootRND property of let’s say “12345478912271”.  When he dies the corpse does not need to generate the loot it simply runs the query to gather each item from the loot list.  One way to do it would be to break the RND down to seven 2 digit numbers used to determine loot.  I’m behind on database performance but an “equals too” query is usually faster than a conditional query and both would be faster than calling code to /RND and select the item.  We hammer the /RND less by just giving the MobID the property on spawn.<br>
<br>
So we grab itemID at position 12 on Loot Table A (legs 1), 34 on Table A (legs 2), 54 on Table C (epic 1), 78 on Table D (epic 2), 91 on Table E (legendary chance),  22 on Table F( trash drops), and 71 on Table G (trash drops).<br>
<br>
I think with the last patch the MobID maybe available to the client for mods like Omen to tell the difference between 2 mobs of the same name.  If this is true, my theory could be proven by being able to see that number before and after this server crash or soft reset events.<br>
<br>
This system hides the property for LootTag and the Loot Tables for that mob from the client so we can’t “peek”.  This also allows them to build generic loot tables and just have mobs pull from that shared table.  The RND could be 16-32 characters or use some sort of quick math to generate the same number each time out of one 16 digits long but still correlate to a 99 or 100 position loot table.  I bet the RND in that property is even used to determine the silver value on the fly. (300 copper + last 3 digits ) = 301 to 1299.<br>
<br>
When we soft reset an instance, I think boss mobIDs are saved to the RaidID.  If we kill that MobID and the instance does not get flagged that he is dead.  He is later spawned with a new LootTag.  The relationship between the RaidID and the “saved” MobID objects could generate these situations depending on the type of error is occurring.  On server crashes, we see the exact same loot because the MobID and lootTag have not changed.  When we kill Shade of Aran 2-3 times in the same RaidID, we are getting new MobIDs and LootTags each time because they relationship to the RaidID is not getting updated.  I wonder if when those situations occur if they see in the raid data a Raid ID with 3 shade of aran kills or if some of them simply got lost in some sort of overrun error or write error and they might only see the one that made it.<br>
<br>
I’m rambling.  If there is a way to record the MobID now though, it would be cool to see if the same MobID generates different loot.  If the MobID persist the whole week on the same boss and other such things.  Not that it matters to the mental goal of wanting to be able to predetermine the loot since the LootTag property and the correlating Loot Tables are not accessible without finding a DB hole to drill and I’m sure that would get attention of their legal department if you have a subscription or not.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
If you search long and hard enough you can create a fake pattern to fit anything you want to explain.<br>
<br>
Of course, when the Cowboys fail to cover that weekend, the handicapper isn't explaining how his 14-4 "sure thing" just went to 14-5. Similarly, when you draw Hero 9 weeks in a row -- and many guilds have -- it's not because they inverted the alphabet.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I'm pretty certain those wouldn't accurately present what happens on a real WoW server; the private servers are reverse engineered based on the things a WoW client expects to receive, and so they wouldn't accurately recreate things which happen purely server side.<br>
<br>
That is, mobs on private servers drop loot, and the code to show which loot is on the mob to the client is probably basically the same. But the actual calculation used to determine what each mob drops is going to be different; that's because that part of looting is calculated exclusively server side.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>
