		<div id="post_message_304661"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->So, from the moment I first saw Dragonspine Trophy start dropping for people, I've been sort of curious about it - it's clearly good, but the mathematician in me has always been curious about just *how* good.  Well, the other day I saw someone post a combat log for half an hour in the blasted lands, so decided to run some analysis on it.  If you want to see the source material, it's linked from the wowhead comments on the item - url is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080406121950/http://putstuff.putfile.com/57121/1853616" target="_blank">http://putstuff.putfile.com/57121/1853616</a><br>
<br>
Now, there were a couple of interesting revelations here.<br>
<br>
First off, lets look at the duration of the procs.  There were 51 periods of haste all told:<br>
<br>
9.86<br>
9.89<br>
9.906<br>
9.922<br>
9.937<br>
9.953<br>
9.953<br>
9.968<br>
9.968<br>
9.969<br>
9.969<br>
9.984<br>
10.0<br>
10.015<br>
10.016<br>
10.016<br>
10.016<br>
10.031<br>
10.031<br>
10.031<br>
10.046<br>
10.047<br>
10.047<br>
10.062<br>
10.062<br>
10.062<br>
10.063<br>
10.063<br>
10.063<br>
10.141<br>
10.156<br>
10.156<br>
10.157<br>
10.157<br>
10.157<br>
10.172<br>
10.172<br>
10.828<br>
12.453<br>
14.266<br>
14.39<br>
14.453<br>
14.968<br>
15.594<br>
16.188<br>
17.5<br>
17.562<br>
19.203<br>
20.812<br>
20.859<br>
23.344<br>
<br>
Now, 37 of those are 10.2 seconds or under - presumably the 10 seconds that it's supposed to run.  But 14 of them are longer than the usual duration - 3 of them by more than a factor of 2.  Hence, these must reflect it proccing and refreshing itself while already up.<br>
<br>
Observation 1: Dragonspine Trophy has no hidden cooldown like Hourglass of the Unraveler does.<br>
<br>
Counting in the (at least) 17 refreshing procs, there were actually 68 procs all told.  Hence the proc rate, massaging some numbers around, is about 1.7 PPM in this test.  Unfortunately, there's not enough information here to determine if it's a fixed percent chance or a proc per minute chance.<br>
<br>
So, that's all pretty basic stuff, and I'm sure someone has already figured it out.  The interesting (and in fact, concerning) part of it is what happens when the actual effect of the haste is measured.<br>
<br>
So, the methodology of this is as follows: I wrote a python script that went through and stripped out the time between each two offhand swings (I chose offhand swings rather than MH so as to remove the effects of sword specialization).  I then compiled two lists of swing spacings, one for swings that occurred when haste was not active, and one it was.  I through out any swing that spanned the start or end of haste.  That is: haste starts (and stops) between two swings.  Since that attack is "partially hasted" I chose not to count it towards either list.  The only swing timers included are those that lie entirely inside or outside a hasted interval.<br>
<br>
Now, there were a few high outliers in this data.  Some of these were due to gouge/bandages with intervals of order 20 sec.  However, there were also a handful of shorter ones, still well above the usual swing interval.  My interpretation of these were that they were indicative of times when an attack missed or was dodged, since there are no misses or dodges listed in the log.  Hence, I removed these from the data as well.<br>
<br>
These corrections made, we're left with 961 unhasted swings (ranging from 1.125 to 1.953 seconds) and 452 hasted swings (ranging from .859 to 1.469 seconds).  Computing the average swing duration in each case, we find that the regular swings averaged 1.422 seconds between attacks, while hasted swings averagesd 1.169 seconds between attacks.  This means, that in a given interval of time, with the haste effect active, one will land roughly 21.64% more swings than one would unhasted.<br>
<br>
But wait!  325 haste rating was, at level 60, 32.5% haste rating.  This was reduced by the standard factor of 1.577 to 20.61%, and then buffed by 50% in patch 2.0.7, so it *should* be giving 30.91% more attacks - why, then, is it only giving 21.6% more attacks?  I see only once possible explanation:<br>
<br>
Observation 2: Dragonspine Trophy is not benefitting from the 50% buff to haste that theoretically occurred in patch 2.0.7.  Note that is *says* it gives the right amount - see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080406121950/http://hem.bredband.net/perwin84/AFGM/dragonspine.gif" target="_blank">http://hem.bredband.net/perwin84/AFGM/dragonspine.gif</a> (linked from Thottbot entry for the item) for instance - but the actual attack rate is not consistant with this display<br>
<br>
It is undetermined as of now whether this is true of all items that give haste rating, or just of dragonspine trophy.  It would be interesting to test with another item that gives haste rating (Abacus of Violent Odds, for instance) and see if it exhibits the same behavior.<br>

Regardless, throwing out the attacks that span a parry, we still have 433 hasted attacks and 912 regular attacks, the means are 1.422 and 1.168, and the speed increase is 21.77%.  On the whole: this does not appear to be a significant effect.<br>

According to the combat mechanics testers parrying an attack resets your melee swing timer to 0 (or some very low figure) ie if you are half way between two swings, and parry an attack you now get to attack right away, instead of having to wait for the remaining half of your timer.<br>

IIRC the posted data on these threads, a parry does not reset your swingtimer but reduces it significantly by a given percentage. <br>
But my common sense says this would only apply to your mainhand swings. So parsing OH swings only should be not affected by "parry haste".<br>
<br>
Just unequip any haste items, and test your parser. Should give an accurate measurement of your OH weapon delay.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Last we saw in the hunter math threads, there's no such thing as partially hasted swings. The swing timer works by using your current haste to determine time until your next swing. If you have a haste effect up when swing1 is fired, that haste will be used to calculate when swing2 lands, even if the haste expires before that time. However if the haste does expire before swing2 lands, then the time between swing2 and swing3 will not be reduced by haste.<br>

Would it be helpful to post a combat log from a hunter? We can guarantee no misses/dodges/parries, no sword spec or off-hand/mainhand filtering, and probably no bandaging/gouging either - I assume your scripts could be run on other combat logs without much trouble?<br>

</div>Sure, I can run numbers on other data sets.  However, see below for an interesting update on the nature of this bug.<br>
<br>
I made some additional modifications today to run on main hand attacks.  I threw out all the stuff that I threw out before, but I additionally dropped any attack where the swing time was interrupted by a parry or sword spec.  This resulted in 193 hasted MH attacks and 407 unhasted OH attacks, with the following result:<br>
<br>

</div>i have to agree with this statement. the trinket is going of very often, and im not surprised if its not procs per minute, but rather %-based. that would also sort out the issue of not having it proc for several minutes, due to unlucky streaks. that is, unless ppm works similairly to %-based.<br>

ive been getting the general feeling that it procs more often the more attackspeed-increasing skills i have active, hence the more attacks and through that bigger chance of proc (if it is indeed %-based). i have not tested this however, merely a feeling i have <!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Hunters have the most frequent non white attacks of any class (excluding spamstring warriors which I am pretty sure is no longer useful).  If the dragonspine is PPM, the proc % is applied based on the non hasted weapon speed.  Because of ranged weapons being relatively slow, and the number of extra attacks a Hunter uses (approximately 4 steadies, 2 arcanes, and 1 multi in 10 seconds), they have a better chance to proc dragonspine than other classes.<br>
<br>
Edit: Quick PPM lesson.  <br>
<br>
Assume Dragonspine is 1ppm.  Assume 3.0 speed bow.  Game converts 1ppm to 1 attack out of 20 (60/3), or 5% proc chance.  Now apply quiver haste, so 23 shots per minute.  Assume steady every 2.6s (hasted bow speed), arcane every 6s, and multi every 10.5s.  Add those together and we now have 61.7 shots per minute.  We have trippled our number of total attacks, yet each attack still has the same 5% proc chance, yielding a fairly high uptime.  I have ignored imp AoTH but it would also grant a few more shots per minute.<br>
<br>
Doing the same thing for a Rogue with a 2.7 speed MH.  Game converts 1ppm to 1 attack out of 22.2(60/2.7), or 4.5% proc chance.  Apply SnD haste, so 28.9 swings per minute, assume Sinister Strike every 4s, evisc every 30s.  Add those together and we now have 45.9 swings per minute.  Windfury and sword spec can potentially give us an extra 25% swings, yielding a total of 57.4 swings per minute, all at a 4.5% proc chance.  To be fair I've ignored additional rogue haste benefits such as blade flurry, assas bonus and blacksmithing mace (which would negate sword spec of course)<br>
<br>
<br>
Of course all of this depends on dragonspine proccing on steadies, arcanes, multis, sinister strikes, windfury attacks and sword specs.  But if it works anything like crusader did, and I suspect it does, there is no reason to think it wouldn't.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Yes, but that doesn't mean his point is wrong. Slow weapon speed means instant attacks will have a higher % of proccing the effect, than if you would use a faster weapon, which could very well mean that hunters (slow weapon speed, a lot of instants) have more uptime on the proc than rogues (faast weapon speed, not that much instants)<br>

*fingers crossed for the thread not getting sidetracked into another "better for my class than yours" or "haste works on GCD!" thread*<br>
<br>
edit: just for discussion's sake, even if haste doesn't affect the GCD, until you get enough haste to reduce your autoshot speed below 1.5s haste still helps since with bows that are slower than that normally, you're still wasting time between steady shot and autoshot by not firing steady again till the next auto has fired. Haste makes the next auto fire sooner, and also makes sure your steady shot shortens in cast time so as not to prevent that auto casting sooner.</div>

</div>As I understand it, the delay from firing the steady begins when the steady ends, not when the GCD ends. Since haste appears to affect both steady and auto in the same ratio, if you weren't clipping your auto while unhasted, you won't be clipping it while hasted either, since the steady finishes casting sooner too.<br>
<br>
Anyway, we have the hunter thread to talk about this!</div>

</div>I believe (from reading the mage thread which has some haste effect stuff in it) that haste effects are different from bloodlust/heroism. Both shaman casts reduce everything by 30%, while haste effects are a percentage based upon the level and the haste size. Bloodlust and heroism basically don't count as haste effects for the purposes of GCD.</div>

Spamming Steady Shot - an ability with 1.5 second cast time (affected by hastes) and no cooldown (excepting the global cooldown) - have, both on its own and combined, given me the error message "That ability isn't ready yet"*.<br>
Trying to use Steady Shot while another Steady Shot is firing (which is the only scenario without any hastes and when the Shot has fired yet) prompts: "Another action in progress"*.<br>
<br>
In other words, haste effects do not reduce the global cooldown for Steady Shot, even though it speeds up its casting time<br>
<br>
<i>*Error messages not verbatim.</i><br>
<br>
-----<br>
<br>
You need a delay of 0.5 seconds after Steady Shot is fired to fire an Auto Shot. This delay is fixed (not affected by hastes).<br>
<br>
-----<br>
<br>
Auto attacks can easily be viewed as an ability with a cooldown, which automatically triggers once the cooldown is up. Attack, set cooldown, when cooldown expires: attack again.<br>
This means there is no such thing as a partially hasted attack.<br>
At the moment of attack, the cooldown (delay until next Auto Attack is possible) is set, based on your current Weapon Speed. This Weapon Speed includes any and all haste effects currently affecting you.<br>
I do not know if dual wielding is handled differently somehow, nor how the Parry time reduction interacts with this.</div>

		<div id="post_message_306268">I apologize for deterring this thread off the hunter subject, but I thought it might be decent data to add to the original topic, with my own experience with my Dragonspine Trophy and procs. When I picked this up, I was kind of on a haste rating kick, and thus wanted to test to proc rate for myself. I went out to the Blasted lands, and for roughly about 40 minutes, just auto attacked (duel wielding) no specials, no Slice and Dice, no instant attacks, with two 1.8 speed weapons. I found the average ppm of the trinket to be for my session at ~2.25ppm, for the whole duration. Granted, like was commented on earlier, there was a significant number of "extended" procs, where the proc just refreshes itself, so I'd be in agreement with the statement that the proc itself has no hidden cooldown - which is nice. I'm at work currently so can't post my procwatch screenshot, but I can do so when I get home this evening, if it will help add anything to the discussion about the trinket.<br>
<br>
I've found the uptime on the buff to be fairly substantial, and an earlier poster in here commented about how a rogue picked it up, and was dissatisfied with the trinket, and banked it - I would say that he just wasn't paying close enough attention to the actual uptime of the proc.<br>
<br>
<i>Edit: Here's the SS</i><br>

<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302183039im_/http://i10.tinypic.com/4d5d8ph.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<br>
One thing to note, was the 'events' as are registered was just the time taken for me to vanish, bandage, and re-initiate combat, but since it was all auto attack anyways I dont think it should effect the data, so you can just add the event times, swings, hits, and procs together.</div>

</div>I think the mod only checks combat messages tied to you, since most similar mods do that. However, note that the effects from Abacus of Violent Odds and (I think) Haste Potions are also named "Haste" - but I doubt he'd accidentally use those while testing this.</div>

I made sure the only item I had equipped that would grant a buff with the word "Haste" in my combat log was infact the Dragonspine Trophy. I also did this very late in the morning, only two people I saw throughout the duration was a fresh 60 warlock running to the Dark Portal, and a leveling guildmate's Shaman who came by to heal me a couple times. I believe I was the only one in the zone other than those people. Also I don't have my combat log set to the maximum range via the command. So it wasn't picking up anyone, but my own procs of the trinket. I'm quite busy with work lately, and Hydross progression, but when I get some spare time (hopefully this weekend) I will get a longer parse for you all.</div>

</div>I've been stacking the haste lately too. Have had problems with accurate parsings though, due to the fact I have 3 effects called Haste (Assassination 2p, Dragonmaw, and Dragonspine Trophy). Is there a mod that differentiates between them?<br>

Definetly fun getting everything stacked up at the same time though. Broken +260% total haste a few times now.</div>

		<div id="post_message_321406">I did some further parsing on this trinket today, and while the results I got weren't as conclusive as I might have liked, we can say a few things about it.<br>
<br>
Test methodology involved blasted lands mobs and straight autoattacking with no proc effects on other than Dragonspine Trophy, and autoattacking until I got low on HP, whereupon I'd vanish, bandage up, and pull him again.<br>
<br>
I kept only a single weapon equipped so as to not have to contend with MH vs OH issues.<br>
<br>
I did this with two different weapons: Warp Splinter's Thorn (1.3) and Demonblood Eviscerator (2.6)<br>
<br>
I assumed that any proc over 11 seconds in length was actually two overlapping procs, and, likewise, any proc over 21 seconds in length was actually 3 overlapping procs.<br>
<br>
With Warp Splinter's Thorn, I attacked 2220 times and got 40 procs, for a proc rate of 1.8%.  Applying elementary statistics indicates that the true proc rate is thus most likely between 1.25% and 2.35%<br>
<br>
With Demonblood Eviscerator, I had 1215 attacks and 39 procs, for a proc rate of 3.2%.  Again, statistics indicate that the true proc rate is between 2.2% and 4.2%<br>
<br>
Converting this into PPM based on weapon speed, we find that Warp Splinter's Thorn procced once every 72 seconds indicating a true average time between procs of somewhere in the range of 55 to 104 seconds; meanwhile Demonblood Eviscerator procced once every 81 seconds, indicating a true average time most likely between 62 and 117 seconds.<br>
<br>
Looking at this, a fixed % proc rate seems unlikely.  The data doesn't rule out a fixed proc rate of 2.3% or so, although it does seem a bit unlikely.<br>
<br>
Similarly, 1 PPM seems unlikely - it falls outside the range of the data for Demonblood Evisecerator, and is right on the edge of the range of Warp Splinter's Thorn.  It is not impossible, but it does seem unlikely.<br>
<br>
So far, the best model for the behavior seems to be a proc rate of around .75-.8 PPM (i.e. one proc every 75 to 80 seconds).  However, more data would be needed to confirm this.  I'll take additional data as I have time to see if I can pin this down further.</div>

		<div id="post_message_321526">I did some testing today and saved the combat logs if you'd like to parse the info. I ran 2 5 min long tests. The first test was a 5s/5r cycle using full talents available to me except bloodfury (as it shouldnt have any effect on proc rates). The second test I ran was the same except for  using 5s/5e cycles. The change in cycles was part of another test and shouldnt effect the outcome of procrate testing I would believe. Anyways....The last 5 minute session here is the procwatch info:<br>
<br>
hits: 478<br>
procs:17<br>
time: 5:00<br>
hits/proc: 28.1<br>
procs/min: 3.3<br>
<br>
<br>
I did not save the in from the first session but i remmeber the ppm was at 3.1<br>
<br>
So the data was similar. Now I am new to all this and just wondering what exactly that means. I am full combat rogue with and was using AR to start with then spamming the cycles previous mentioned. I alos used blade flurry when it was up throughout the 5 mins. This data was teaken with full raid gear on and no other haste procs available through Assasition set, Blackout truncheon, etc. <br>
<br>
Am I to believe that  this is telling me thatbased on 2 weapons the proc rate is close to 50%? Reading back in the original post that would fit with the expected percentage of 25% with the buffed haste proc rating couple patches ago.<br>
<br>
Thanks for all insight. Just trying to understand this trinket a little better and how the PPM rating works.<br>
<br>
If you'd like a copy of the combat log PM me here with contact info and I"ll send it to you.<br>

</div>Quick math says around a 10.8% chance to proc per swing, assuming 1.7ppm. Speed increase is on par with top ranked flurry, 10 seconds gives you 3-4 hasted swings, depending on what procs it and when in the swing timer.<br>
<br>
It's essentially like having flurry with an 11% crit rate. Seems like an "oooh, shiny!" bid, or a future scoop for a DW fury respec.</div>

I came up with about 3.8 raw ppm but it counted every proc twice and I don't know why.<br>

So with adding the refresh procs and dividing through 2 because of the double counted events I'd say 2.5 to 3.0 PPM.<br>

		<div id="post_message_352917"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->in further use of this thing, I've found the proc rate to be much closer to 2.0 ppm, and definately not 1.7ppm.   But since it can proc off itself, and its likely modified by attack speed, it will go over 2.0ppm while haste is active... so  with the time i am @ .75 attack speed, i have better chance to proc again.<br>
<br>
in the end 2.0-2.5ppm is what I experience.<br>

As for bear form, it provides excellent TPS/DPS gain if you are willing to sacrifice the trinket slot.<br>

I'm looking for references to good analyses, all in one place, as to exactly how much impact this trinket has for each class, and what the alternatives do. I could not find a topic dealing with this specifically on these forums.<br>

#1 -- Rogues, Fury Warriors, Enhancement Shaman (highest dps take priority)<br>
#2 -- Hunters (MM?)<br>
#3 -- MS warriors, BM hunters<br>
#1000 -- Feral druids<br>

We have 4 rogues, and potentially 2 or 3 hunters whose dps justifies this trinket. The current proposal is that the first 2 go to rogues, the 3rd goes to a hunter, and the 4th becomes an open roll among the classes who most need it. Feedback, and links to good analyses are better.

</div>Yes... however, when you have guilds like mine that have seen 1 since March.... you really don't even consider that option.  Our Enhancement Shaman has aggro issues anyway, you need to give it to the person who will get the most benefit out of it, which is going to be your highest DPS Rogue.  Haste doesn't help BM Hunters because it just leads to clipping, and warriors are threat capped as well.<br>
<br>
So, unless you have been uncommonly lucky (in which case I hate you), you should give it to your rogues first.  The benefit there is so much higher then anyone else, because first off you are doing more damage or should be so the % increase is higher, and the fact that we get more energy when it procs due to Combat Potency Procs.  Linking Abacus, Haste Pot, Drums, Heroism and this procing you better have your finger on evasion/vanish.<br>
<br>
I should be getting the next one that drops, but Gruul hates us and has only dropped 1, and has dropped the rogue legs once in the last 3 months, which were given to a F&amp;F because the officers figured we wanted T5...<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Agreed, having haste does absolutely nothing to the value of Sinister Strike or Backstab they are still based off of your normal weapon sweep and attack power.<br>
<br>
However, it is my understanding the the amount of rage a warrior generates per hit is reduced when they have haste, aka hitting with a 2.8 speed weapon for 500 and hitting with a 2.8 speed weapon hasted to 2.5 speed will not generate the same amount of rage... which is what I think Malan is getting at.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
A dps warrior is in the same position as a shaman threat wise, but with a half decent tank it is not a problem for either.<br>
<br>
Do you give all your caster items to your warlocks? Fuck off the mages and spriests because they do less damage, No you wouldn't and if you did they would leave for a decent guild.

Some guilds like to make sure items that drop from bosses that don't necessarily make the scheduled raids when working on new content go to the people that will benefit raid dps the most. This means both reliable players who aren't going to loot and scoot, and the players that have proven to be top dps in the past. If there is a rogue that is dependable and consistently tops the charts, hell yes he should get it.<br>

		<div id="post_message_423515"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Part of being in a successful guild is keeping members happy, we dont have people "loot and scoot" so that is not an issue for us.

<br>
Pissing off your shaman or dps warrior will go along way to them not enjoying the game, replacing either with equal geared/skilled players would not be easy, same goes for all classes.<br>

I would suggest it maybe comes down to the type of person that plays a rogue, often (but not in all cases) the rogues i've been in guilds with have been selfish and perhaps what you may call a "loot whore" not always a bad thing, pixels are what drives some people so thats fine.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Less blanket statements that are completely wrong thanks.<br>
<br>
The dragonspine trophy is pretty much the best DPS trinket for any class, and which scales very very well (I believe that tsunami talisman/madness are better for feral druids but not entirely sure on that due to haste rating interaction with procs). When everyone uses different systems (multiple styles of DKP or loot council systems) arguing over who should get the trinket in class-specific terms is just stupid. <br>
<br>
People in Celebrity are likely to be more aggressive over the trinket than other people may be due to us having had one drop since the start of doing Gruul.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

My point was only to say that it's not the same percentages between classes.  5% can make quite a difference during a fight.  Last morogrim I was at 107% at the end according to Omen during executes.  <br>
<br>
Regardless, I was agreeing about it being stupid to limit it by class...people can leave those kinds of comments to thottbot.

I just want to emphasize this, Hit is great and all but you really need to be smart about your gear decisions (or simply use the spreadsheet and look at all the pretty numbers).  <br>
<br>
Getting hit capped simply because everyone is doing it or because you think you should is quite wrong.  I had one rogue show me his gear and exclaim that now that he was hit capped he was going to do SOOO much more dmg, relevant here because he had taken off his DST for a DFT for the last few points of hit rating.  Needless to say I yelled at him for about 10 minutes before he got over the whole ideology of needing to be hit capped.<br>
<br>
Currently im trying to maintain about 22.5% hit for the somewhat rare occaisions that we do utilize a moonkin in raids.  Our guild is quite big and we use a bidding system for loot, meaning that I dont have the opportunity to pick up spare sets of gear and really dont want to gem my main dps gear solely hit which is pretty much unnecessary for grinding/questing.<br>
<br>
Back on topic - Our guild has also gotten just the one DST and we do Gruul/Mag only when we have no other options &lt;missing essential personnel for specific fights etc&gt; for additional anecdotal evidence I really really love my trinket, it makes me happy.<br>
<br>
It really is a shame that something so good is going to become even harder to get for each and every rogue.  When asked how good it really is I always reply the same, "I'm going to continue to use it until i'm lvl 80."<br>
<br>
Also /wave to the lil gnome rogue from shattered hand.  I dont think i've ever seen you around, ill be lookin <!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_424020"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->My reason for asking how beneficial this item is for each class is not to say that some deserve it and some don't; obviously if scarcity weren't an issue, anyone who wanted it should get it.  The point is that some guilds use a loot council, and that loot council makes decisions on who gets gear for a variety of reasons.<br>
<br>
It's an absolutely valid question to try to figure out exactly how good it is for each class.  If it were the best trinket in the game for both combat rogues and enhancement shaman, with equivalent dps upgrades for each, then the loot council would take into account other factors as well.  What other trinkets are available or will soon be available to each class?  What is the raid attendance of each member?  How much has each player done on their own to improve personal dps?<br>
<br>
Conversations such as these CAN turn into misinformation fests and name-calling, but that definitely doesn't mean that it's not worthwhile to attempt to determine just exactly what the impact is to each class.  As a rogue, I see it as a responsibility to find out what items are upgrades for me, and attempt to quantify them (using great tools such as the rogue dps spreadsheet).  That way, I feel confident passing minor upgrades for myself to other players who benefit more from them.<br>
<br>
I could simply choose to say "this is the best trinket in the game right now for a rogue by a ton, I should get it."  I think that would be greedy and immature.  Instead, I want to find out how good it is for other classes before I make any statement on it.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>This sentence kinda stood out for me, the threat dumping abilities that some classes get cant be matched unless a warrior or shaman kill themselves during a fight or you have unbelievable threat generation on your tank.

</div>What you're saying is completely true &lt;combat rogue&gt; what you mean to say is "this trinket is best utilized by a rogue by far, i should get it!"  Saying that pre-emptively without full facts would be greedy and immature.  However - in my own anecdotal opinion it is correct.  <br>
<br>
I dont have any real idea about a hunter, there has been alot of discussion about it clipping shots and messing up rotations and it seems with certain variables it may be a very good trinket.  For a fury warr or enhancement shaman it is the same trinket that it is for a rogue (procs notwithstanding) but in a raid environment those two classes are threat capped and forced to hold back at times whereas 90% of the time a rogue has a way out to continue dps.  Most of that is of course situational and maybe even flat out wrong for other guilds, but thats been my experience with both fury and enh specs.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_425478"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Thank you for the input.  I'm trying to get closer to the hit cap while keeping my crit and AP up, but things like the DST, WSC and other such effects are a little newer on my list of prioritization, so the help is appreciated.<br>
<br>
I'll be trying out the Thundering Skyfire tonight and will keep my eyes peeled for a DST the next time we do Gruul.  I've played with an old version of the DPS calculator, but unfortunately work seems to have the site it's currently available at blocked, and I haven't set up my home computer for such files yet.<br>
<br>
Perhaps to kill time tomorrow I'll mail the file to my work computer, or just stop being lazy and get the excell alternative mentioned.  Either way, I'm trying to gear intelligently and avoid wasting gear and dkp on trinkets I won't get the most out of.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_425505"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Anecdotally, the haste procs are a nice boost to my damage that are less prone to huge aggro pulling crits.<br>
<br>
Between Mongoose, Thundering Skyfire, Dragonspine and Flurry, it's very rare that I swing at "normal" speeds.  However, I realize that often my offhand, Malchazeen, ends up at a sub-1.0spd on my character sheet.  I've seen numerous comments that your swing timer doesn't actually go below 1.0, so this puts an interesting twist on the value of haste.<br>
<br>
I find that Thundering Skyfire is drastically limited by it's internal cooldown; reviewing WWS from our raids, it has about half the number of instances as DST.  Given that it's a much smaller haste boost, it may be that the Relentless Earthstorm actually provides more benefit for a class with a substantial crit value.  I need to investigate this with some math.<br>
<br>
While I'd be thoroughly excited by the Tsunami Talisman, I think it's far more prudent to keep the damn Fetish of the Sand Reaver in my other trinket slot, eat the dps loss compared to the Tsunami and try to keep my ass alive.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I don't know much about feral druids, but I don't see how this could possibly be bad for them either. In the end, it should be awarded to the person who will make the most raid wise usage of it. If it's a druid with 100% attendance and more DKP, than fine. He earned it.

</div>Doesn't a substantial chunk of hunter DPS come from the pet? That's the only thing that comes to mind.<br>
<br>
Our DSTs went to an MS/slam warrior first, due to the fact we had no DKP set up at the time and we were /rolling. He actually only rolled to keep it out of the hands of a new/unreliable rogue, but his damage appears to have gone way up (uses a Gorehowl and beats the Fury warrior with T3 axe). <br>

		<div id="post_message_425850"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Yeah after looking over some of our WWS parses I think I've changed my mind about hunters. I thought a larger portion of their total damage came from sources that DST won't affect. Apparently even BM hunters are getting a decent chunk of their damage(about 60%) from auto shot and Steady Shot, and haste will improve both of those.<br>
<br>
I think the item is still noticeably more effective in the hands of a combat sword rogue than any other class. They get a huge portion of their total damage from auto attacks, sword specialization and Windfury procs. Rogues also just plain deal more damage than the other classes, and as such net a larger benefit from percentage based damage increases.<br>
<br>
Hunters, enhancement shaman and fury warriors all appear to benefit about equally from the item. I think feral druids gain the least from it. A huge chunk of their total damage comes from special attacks, and they just deal less damage than the other physical dps classes. They also spend a lot of their time in raids as a tank, and not a damage dealer.<br>
<br>
I'm still not sure how good haste is for arms spec warriors. I know ours does a ton of damage via Slam, and even though haste reduces the casting time of Slam, I'm not sure how that all works after the talents and global cooldown come into play.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_425918"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Actually, after looking into it a bit more I might have re-convinced myself that haste is not as good for hunters as it is for rogues, warriors and enhancement shaman. <br>
<br>
Even though haste rating reduces the casting time of Steady Shot it still doesn't allow you to Steady Shot any more than you already were, because the global cooldown is the limiting factor. Haste basically makes it easier to fit Steady Shot's in between your auto shots.<br>
<br>
Our BM hunters rarely do more than 40% of their total damage via auto shot, and I bet they average closer to 35% or lower on a lot of encounters. Our sword rogues and fury warrior on the other hand do about 65% of their total damage via melee attacks that benefit from haste. I personally do about 55% of my damage via attacks that benefit from haste.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
The item in question is ridiculous for classes that can claim a large portion of their damage comes from auto-attack, as all haste effects are for those classes, see the treatise on haste in the mechanic's forum for details.  It becomes less ridiculous the further away from auto-attack you migrate, to a low end of presumably mage/warlocks who recieve very little real benefit from it indeed.<br>
<br>
As with all loot-council type decisions, you should award your raid's loot to the people who show up and are valuable to your raid.  That's basicly the point of loot council.<br>
<br>
In case you somehow missed the theorycraft amid all the "best for me" posts:<br>
<br>
<b>The largest numerical/theoretical gain from it is going to be a hamstring spamming warrior, then a combat potency rogue.</b><br>
<br>
Many factors will mitigate the theorycrafted "best use" (not the least of which is that noone performs at their full theorycrafted potential in real play) and in the end the trinket is highly desirable and should probably have been a quest reward "always drops" type item given that desirability.<br>
<br>
Lastly, expect to see this item nerfed - as it's out of place in terms of desirability vs difficulty.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<!-- message -->
		<div id="post_message_426629"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Again, this discussion for me has never been about "best for me"--it's an attempt to understand the impact for each class.  Value per class is one of the main factors involved in determining who gets an item.  Since ideal hunter dps with haste is not modeled anywhere that I can see, I have become more interested in going down that path.  I am posting what I have posted in my guild's loot council forum.  I would appreciate if anyone can correct me where I have gone wrong:<br>
<br>
"I believe completely that this is a strong upgrade for any spec of hunter; the reason that I have turned my focus towards exactly how haste mechanics work is because it illustrates why hunters generally choose to avoid haste procs given similar dps gains through other items, and why rogues receive continued bonuses from haste procs. Hunters will always benefit from extra haste (up to their cap), but don't want to stack haste beyond that, so they a) don't receive full benefit from the multiplicative aspects of haste, and b) don't receive full benefit from the chain-proccing aspects of haste.<br>
<br>
In order to maximize the impact of haste (separate from how each class benefits from it) you would attempt to have all of your haste affects up at the same time. There are 2 reasons for this-- The first is that each separate effect that "increases attack speed" is multiplied together. Anything that says "haste rating" is added together to form one number that creates one effect (Attack speed % increase = Total haste rating/10.52)-- Each separate "Attack speed" effect is multiplied by that amount.<br>
<br>
If you have a weapon with 1.0 attack speed and 100.0 dps, here is the impact of using Slice and Dice and Blade Flurry:<br>
<br>
1st 10 seconds -- Slice and Dice (130% increase) -- 1.0 speed weapon becomes 1/1.3 = .769 speed. It will hit 13 times in 10 seconds, giving 1300 damage.<br>
2nd 10 seconds -- Blade Flurry (120% increase) -- 1.0 speed weapon becomes 1/1.2 = .833 speed. It will hit 12 times in 10 seconds, giving 1200 damage.<br>
<br>
Total Damage for 20 seconds --&gt; 1500.<br>
<br>
If you used them together, you get different results:<br>
<br>
1st 10 seconds -- Slice and Dice (130% and Blade Flurry 120%) -- 1.0/(1.2*1.3) = .641 speed. It will hit 15.6 times in 10 seconds, giving 1560 damage<br>
2nd 10 seconds -- no haste effects --&gt; 1000 damage<br>
Total damage for 20 seconds ---&gt; 1560 --&gt; 4% increase in damage.<br>
<br>
Simply by using these 2 effects together, you gain a 4% increase in damage. Adding a 3rd "effect" into the equation by combining all of your haste rating effects at once, you get a geometrically larger number of damage.<br>
<br>
The second reason why it's beneficial to attempt to stack haste effects is that each time you gain extra haste, you do more hits, which increases the likelihood that you will activate another haste proc, which in turn increases the likelihood that you will activate another...ad infinitum. Think of it like a car--it takes a while to get it started, but once you start the haste rolling, it keeps going at faster and faster speeds. The more procs that are possible for you to achieve, the higher the value of each point of haste, and the more beneficial adding extra haste is.<br>
<br>
Rogues who have geared up appropriately have the following ways to increase haste in PvE:<br>
Slice and Dice -- 30% increase to attack speed (finishing move; a rogue will keep this ability up about 99% of the time they are hitting a target)<br>
Blade Flurry -- 20% increase to attack speed (2 minute cooldown)<br>
Abacus of Violent Odds--260 haste rating for 10 seconds (every 2 minutes)<br>
Haste Potion--400 haste rating for 15 seconds (consumable, useable every 2 minutes)<br>
Drums of Battle--80 haste rating for 30 seconds (Leatherworking, 2 minute cooldown)<br>
Thundering Skyfire Diamond -- metagem that gives 240 haste for 6 seconds (proc)<br>
Mongoose Enchant -- One on each weapon--120 agility, 2% weapon speed increase (proc, can stack, so 2 possible)<br>
Dragonspine Trophy -- 325 haste rating for 10 seconds (proc, no cooldown)<br>
Heroism-- 30% increase to attack speed for 40 seconds (Shaman ability--10 minute cooldown--only ability in game that reduces the global cooldown)<br>
<br>
<br>
Hunters have the following haste options (correct me if I am wrong):<br>
Quiver/Bullet Bag--15% Ranged Attack speed increase -- always active<br>
Rapid Fire--40% Ranged Attack speed increase (15 seconds, 5 minute cooldown -- 3 with talents)<br>
Improved Aspect of the Hawk (First Tier BM)--15% Ranged Attack speed increase (10% chance on hit)<br>
Abacus of Violent Odds--260 haste rating for 10 seconds (every 2 minutes)<br>
Drums of Battle--80 haste rating for 30 seconds (Leatherworking, 2 minute cooldown)<br>
Thundering Skyfire Diamond -- metagem that gives 240 haste for 6 seconds (proc)<br>
Dragonspine Trophy -- 325 haste rating for 10 seconds (proc, no cooldown)<br>
Heroism-- 30% increase to attack speed for 40 seconds (Shaman ability--10 minute cooldown--only ability in game that reduces the global cooldown, so has no negative affect towards haste-capping)<br>
<br>
BM spec only:<br>
Serpent's Swiftness (requires 40 points in BM)--20% ranged combat attack speed -- always active<br>
<br>
Separate from any other benefit, every hunter has the effects of haste capped when their auto-shot speed gets down to 1.5 seconds. The reason for this is that the ideal shot rotation is auto-shot--&gt;steady shot when you hit appropriate haste levels. You activate the global cooldown of 1.5 seconds at the beginning of each steady shot, and your auto-shot can't hit for another .5 seconds after you finish casting. This means that the highest number of steady shots that you can possibly cast are 1.5 seconds apart (which you attempt to cast right after your auto-shot hits).<br>
<br>
A hunter with a 2.9 speed weapon hits their effective haste cap whenever they get their multiplicative increases above 193% (2.9/1.93 = 1.5). A MM hunter with a quiver (115%), with Imp Aspect of the Hawk procced (115%), who has just activated Rapid Fire (140%) is already operating at 185% weapon speed (1.15*1.15*1.4=1.8515). Any other haste effect that increases weapon speed by 3% is pushing them past their cap, and is wasted. A DST proc would be wasted in this case; a hunter does not want to use a haste potion, as this will push them past their cap, as will using the drums of battle. A thundering skyfire gem proc would also push them past their cap, and be wasted. At the time when the hunter would most be able to benefit from the multiplicative aspects of haste, they are not able to make use of any haste procs or on-use effects.<br>
<br>
In fact, any time that a hunter with a 2.9 speed weapon has a quiver and Imp Aspect of the Hawk procced, an extra haste rating of 474 pushes them past their haste cap. (1.15*1.15*(1+474/(10.52*100))) = 1.93. A MM hunter with DST would exceed that cap any time that DST and IAOTH procs while using a haste potion, or the abacus, or get a thundering skyfire gem proc--and definitely would never want to combine any of these effects.<br>
<br>
Alternatively, a rogue would attempt to use all procs at once. With only on use effects (and not counting any procs), rogues achieve (1.3*1.2*(1+740/(10.52*100))) = 266% increase in attack speed every two minutes, not counting heroism. Haste procs become increasingly likely as you achieve this attack speed, which bolster their effectiveness by 120% as much as if they happened separate from all of these other effects. A DST proc at this time would send the attack speed to 314%, any thundering skyfire or mongoose proc would keep increasing attack speed.<br>
<br>
Again, by stacking haste effects and haste procs, rogues achieve maximum dps. By stacking haste effects and haste procs, hunters quickly reach a haste cap. Additionally, hunters have to alter their shot rotation in order to achieve maximum benefit from any haste proc. This is not a trifling matter; the hunter becomes limited both by their skill as well as by lag. This doesn't mean that haste doesn't increase hunter dps, but it does mean that hunters make the maximum use of their haste when they can anticipate it, when they have minimal lag (in order to time steady shots immediately after auto-shots fire), and when they can be sure that they will not go over their haste caps. Rogues do not have anything that limits the impacts they receive from haste procs; they benefit from a proc-based system."<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_427099"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I'll start my reply by saying that I have a Dragonspine Trophy; in fact, I have the first one that ever dropped for my guild.<br>
<br>
This thread sounds a lot like the discussions on my old raiding guild's forums about who deserved a Drama Fang Talisman more. Whereas once we argued about how Hunters reached the Hit% cap easily and rogues didn't, now we (meaning the EJ forums) talk about how Hunters reach the Haste% cap easily and rogue's don't (ever).<br>
<br>
I'm a BM spec hunter, 41/20/0, and I read on the forums all the time about how this trinket is "useless" for us. This couldn't be farther from the truth, really. Gone are the days where loot would be "wasted" on a Hunter; properly geared and specced, we have just as much damage potential as any other class. This fact alone screams louder than all the others that there should no longer be any "class priority" on such a trinket.<br>
<br>
By far the most prevalent argument is, of course, that we reach the Haste% cap easily. That doesn't mean we shouldn't be allowed to find more efficient ways to reach that cap, so that we might improve our personal dps. In ye olden days, a DFT instead of my Royal Seal of Eldre'Thalas would have allowed me to drop 2% hit from other pieces of gear and wear crit% gear in it's place; effecting an increase in dps.<br>
<br>
Ounce, you wrote down a list of possible haste buffs and equips/talents for hunters, then talked about how we already had "more than enough" options for Haste to hit the 1.5 second barrier. Unfortunately, many of the things you listed (the trinkets and Rapid Fire, mostly) have long cooldowns and have other items that are superior to them for dps. The reason we want DST is precisely the same reason everyone else wants it; for any class with autoattacking white damage, it's the best trinket in the game.<br>
<br>
DST procs more often than Imp AotH does (YMMV), and has a greater effect than Imp AotH. This has allowed me to take points from that talent and place them in Endurance, which doesn't sound like much yet has saved me many times. DST has no internal cooldown, no cooldown whatsoever, which makes it superior to trinkets like the Abacus, far superior to Rapid Fire.<br>
<br>
Thundering Skyfire is a decent option for hunters, but we're much better off with a +12 Agi / +3% crit chance meta paired with a DST anyway. Not everyone is a leatherworker, not everyone has a Shaman, and it doesn't matter anyway because DST is exceedingly better than Drums or Heroism anyway.<br>
<br>
If I may repeat myself, we want it for the same reason everyone wants it. It's the best physical dps trinket in the game and seems like it will be for a long long time. I daresay even with an internal cooldown (which Blizzard had a chance to add in 2.1 and didn't.. in fact, they buffed the trinket even further with the +40 AP) it would still be the best physical dps trinket in the game.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>The math the hunter in my guild put up indicated that the issue is more that it isn't a 1.5 second barrier, it is closer to 1.7 due to lag, etc.<br>
<br>
Here is the math he posted:<br>

				So first off let's lay on the basic hunter mechanics. For Bm hunters.<br>
<br>
Basic Mechanics for Hunters = GCD = 1.5 seconds<br>
                                            Autoshot delay = .5 seconds<br>
                                            Steady shot time = 1.5 seconds<br>
                                            Steady shot time w/ Serpent's swiftness = 1.3 seconds<br>
<br>
                                            GCD w/ Serpent's swiftness = 1.5 seconds<br>
                                            Autoshot Delay w/ Serpent's Swiftness = .5 seconds<br>
                                            <br>
                                            <br>
<br>
                                      <br>
Standard Bow/Gun Speed = 2.90/ 3.00<br>
<br>
Standard Bow/Gun Speed w/ 15% Quiver = 2.5 / 2.6        [2.9/115 x 100] and [3.0/115x100]<br>
Standard Bow/Gun Speed w/ 15% Quiver + 20% haste <br>
                                                             = 2.10/2.18      [2.9/115/120 x100x100]<br>
                                                                                    [3.0/115/120 x100x100]<br>
<br>
At these speeds with the current autoshot delay as well as the new steady shot timer.<br>
<br>
steady shot = 1.3 seconds + 0.5 second delay. You leave .30 or .38 seconds in between steady shots.<br>
<br>
Now hasted with Imp hawk = 15% more haste.<br>
Steady shot time = 1.2 seconds (rounded up as caclulated by blizz) + 0.5 second delay = 1.7 seconds<br>
<br>
autoshot = 1.82  leaving .12 or .19 in between steady shots. <br>
<br>
at any form of latency here you are going to clip your autoshots and effectively delay it. ALso screwing up your shot rotation and putting you in a poistion where you really have to monitor too many things.<br>
<br>
This is why it is not beneficial to stack haste because as the GCD stays the same and the steady shot timer diminishes its haste return the more haste you have, the more likely you are to clip autoshots and the haste benefits become less and less of a positive return to your dps. Ie instead of adding 15% dps as it should for those 8 seconds it effectively adds in realistic terms with human error about 3% for those ten seconds.

</div>The main issue is that a hunter has to catch the proc perfectly to make the most of it, where as a rogue just has to keep spamming his normal rotations and make sure he isn't wasting energy/combo points.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_429082"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Hanos, that math is flawed. How to explain... The problem is the post you copied isn't written very well, but I'll get to the point as best I can.<br>
<br>
In that post, a 2.9 speed bow is shown to have a 2.1 attack speed with a 15% quiver and 20% from Serpent's Swiftness. This is correct. However, at that point in the post, Steady Shot is still shown to have a 1.3 second cast time, and this is <i>incorrect</i>.<br>
<br>
Put it another way. I have a Sunfury Bow, 2.9 base speed. Here's a little chart.<br>
<br>
<br>
<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px">
	<div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom:0px"><img src="assets/code_html.gif" border="0"></div>
	<pre class="alt2" dir="ltr" style="
		margin: 0px;
		padding: 3px;
		border: 1px inset;
		width: 694px;
		height: 114px;
		text-align: left;
		overflow: auto">Sunfury Bow of the Phoenix

             Base Cast Time      +Quiver Haste    +SS Haste    +DST Haste

Autoshot     2.9                  2.52            2.10          1.60
Steady       1.5                  1.30            1.08          0.82</pre>
</div>Thus, you can see, with Quiver, Serpent Swiftness, and Dragonspine up, the gap between Steady and Autoshot is a healthy (as such) 0.8 seconds... plenty enough time to fit an autoshot "cast time" in.<br>
<br>
There are a few arguments that come in here.<br>
<br>
1) What if Imp AotH procs alongside DST? Then your autoshot cast time is below 1.5 seconds, shorter than the GCD, forcing you to clip/clobber autoshots?<br>
<br>
      Answer to this is simple. Don't spec Imp AotH.<br>
<br>
1a) If you don't spec Imp AotH, aren't you losing all the dps that DST gives you?<br>
<br>
      Also a simple answer; DST procs off all shots, Imp AotH only procs off Autoshot. DST gives 31% haste, Imp AotH gives 15%. In my experience, DST is a much better buff than Imp AotH is... Speccing out of Imp AotH allows you to keep Hawk up for the RAP without worrying about rotations. And you can funnel those points into Endurance for greater survivability.<br>
<br>
2) What if your ping/lag/connection is too slow, or your computer's framerate is too slow?<br>
<br>
     My connection is great and so is my computer, these problems do not apply to me. Your mileage may vary.<br>
<br>
<br>
EDIT: All theorycrafting aside, honestly. I have a DST and am BM spec, and have consistently been able to keep up a 1.6 second autoshot/steadyshot cast cycle, with Kill Commands.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I understand the jist of your argument, but in this case, you used an item to replace your need for Imp AoTH, and then took a talent that's going to net you somewhere around 400 more health.  <br>
<br>
Aside from probably very rare cases where that 400 health would have prevented you from dying, how does that improve your personal DPS?<br>

Couldn't you have achieved similar results by keeping Imp AoTH, and using the netherwing Commander's Badge trinket (+45 stam)?

</div>Having extra points in Endurance is the LEAST benefit that results from having DST.  I simply mentioned it along with the rest. Namely, the reason for having DST over imp AotH is that DST provides double the haste and procs more often. I thought I said that already &gt;.&gt;<br>
<br>
Additionally, I look ahead to a time (though I didn't have any idea about it back when I actually GOT my DST) when I can equip several pieces of Black Temple +haste gear, switch to MM, and use DST for a nice 1:1 cycle instead of the standard, more difficult 1:1.5 cycle.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Namely, the reason for having DST over imp AotH is that DST provides double the haste and procs more often. I thought I said that already &gt;.&gt;</div>

	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>The obvious follow up question to that is:<br>
<br>
Is using DST with no Imp AotH better than using Imp AotH + another trinket, such as Tsunami Talisman?  <br>
<br>
Say you have 33% crit, you have the Sunfury, are BM spec, thus fire two shots every 2.1 sec, that's three shots every 3.15 sec.  Tsunami will proc after at most 31.5 sec (time it takes for 10 crits).  You then get 340 AP for 10 sec, and a 45 sec cooldown.  We can assume, for the sake of simplification, that over time, it will average out to about 1 proc every minute.  That makes an average of 56.7 AP a second.  I'm ignoring Imp Hawk procs for right now, as they will decrease the time it takes to proc Tsunami.  <br>
<br>
So, we get a constant 38 crit, 10 hit, and 56.7 AP.  I'll ignore the contribution to Pet DPS because I'm not sure how to figure it out (though if someone can, I would be most appreciative).  Doing a bit of hand waving, I'll convert the 38 crit and 56.7 AP into raid DPS.  Specifically, from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080618031336/http://lanfiles.williams.edu/~mbobes/wws/1007fl/" target="_blank">my WWS logs</a> I can estimate that 1 DPS increase increase on my character sheet will translate into a 2 DPS raid damage increase (ignoring my pet's damage).  38 crit translates roughly into 76 ap, 10 hit into 20 ap, and 152.7 AP will translate into 15.27 DPS on the character sheet, into 30.54 DPS in a raid.  If we subtract out the 40 AP on DST, we get 22.54 DPS.<br>
<br>
So Tsunami is getting us 22.54 DPS as compared to DST.  Is the difference between using a DST or using Imp Hawk going to give us a bigger DPS increase than the 22.54 DPS we could be getting from the Tsunami Talisman instead?  On Wowhead people are reporting DST as 1.5 procs per minute.  Again, from looking at WWS logs for our hunters, we end up averaging about 1.5 procs per minute on Imp Hawk too.  I admit, the PPM aren't very accurately computed, and if someone has better figures, I'd be glad to use those instead.  <br>
<br>
In any case, assuming they both proc about the same, then 1.5 times a minute we get a haste proc.  In one case, it's 15%, we go from two shots in 2.1 sec to two in 1.83 sec for 12 sec.  In the other, two in 1.62 sec for 10.  Taking my DPS from the same log, 780, we can figure that in 2.1 sec I'm normally doing 1638 damage.  Same amount of damage in 1.83 sec is 895 DPS, in 1.62 is 1011 DPS.  So, for Imp Hawk we get 18 seconds a minute of 115 extra DPS, or 34.5 DPS.  For DST, we get 12 sec a minute of 231 extra DPS, or 46.2 DPS.  The difference of using a DST over Imp Hawk is less than 12 DPS.  Say DST procs more often, like 2 PPM, that's 16 sec, 61.6 DPS total, 27.1 DPS more for DST than for Imp Hawk.<br>
<br>
So it depends on proc rate.  At 1.5 procs per minute for both Hawk and DST, Tsunami + Imp Hawk is the winning combination.  If the proc rate for DST is higher than 1.5, or the proc rate for Imp Hawk is lower, than DST may well be the better choice.  Hmm, guess I need to find more accurate proc rates for them.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Because instead you could use Tsunami + Bloodlust Brooch + Imp AotH, for example.<br>
<br>
But my general question was, is DST + some trinket better than Imp AotH + some trinket + some other trinket?  From what I can figure out, Imp AotH + Trinket + Trinket is better than just DST + Trinket; the loss of Imp AotH (which you need to give up to make DST viable) is enough to make DST not worth using.  But it depends on the respective proc rates.  If DST procs sufficiently more than Imp Hawk, it may very well be worth giving up those talents and the trinket slot.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Then there's the difference between me and you.  I view Surefooted as an enabler.  Getting surefooted means that I can go after different gear.  Effectively, it buys me item points equivalent to 54 hit raiting that I can convert from hit into agility or ap or crit. <br>

</div>Your rogue comparison is incorrect.  Rogues don't need to weave their specials in between auto-attacks, thus they are not hindered by a change in their auto-attack timer.  Hunters are limited by reaction time, latency, and the GCD in how fast we can weave shots in.<br>
<br>
Regardless, I went with Rhius' statement that you should have Imp AotH, or DST, but that having both would cause problems.  You bring up an interesting point.  If you do have both, you have 4 possible cases at any given time:<br>
1) no proc is up, you're just DPSing like normal<br>
2) Imp AotH is up, you're DPSing like normal with a DPS boost due to haste<br>
3) DST is up, you're DPSing like normal with a DPS boost due to haste<br>
4) Imp AotH and DST is up, your auto-attack is faster than the GCD, so you're either pushing back all your auto-shots and thus voiding the haste benefit of Imp AotH, or you're changing to a different cycle for the duration of the overlap.<br>
<br>
That 4th scenario is the one Rhius was looking to avoid.  It's beyond me to model their interaction to see how often you have 1 up but not the other, and how often you have both up.  However, what if you just stick to your normal cycle?  When they're both up, you end up pushing back your auto-shots to beyond the GCD, thus nullifying the benefit of the Imp Hawk proc.  Maybe you don't care?  Imp Hawk becomes a haste buff you're happy to have between DST procs.  And if Hawk procs during a DST proc, it's wasted, but oh well.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

From what I can figure out, Imp AotH + Trinket + Trinket is better than just DST + Trinket; the loss of Imp AotH (<b>which you need to give up to make DST viable</b>) is enough to make DST not worth using.  But it depends on the respective proc rates.  If DST procs sufficiently more than Imp Hawk, it may very well be worth giving up those talents and the trinket slot.</div>

You are totally wrong, dropping IAotH will be a net dps loss. You act like the 2 procs are tied together somehow and will only proc at the same time. Sometimes they will proc at the same time and IAotH will be wasted, however when IAotH procs any other time its +dps, a lot more than a little more stamina will get you.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I agree with you.  I took Rhius post that you should get a DST and spec out of IAotH, and just ran with it to see where it would take me.<br>
<br>
You're suggesting using both IAotH and DST, figuring that it will mean more haste procs are up for a damage boost, and at worst case you waste an IAotH proc when it overlaps with DST's.<br>
<br>
So then here's the next question as I see it:  Does using IAotH + DST, assuming you stick to the same cycle and delay your auto-shots to 1.6 sec when they're both up, net you higher DPS than using IAotH + Tsunami?<br>
<br>
For this, we would assume that our normal auto-shot speed is 2.1 sec, our auto-shot speed with Hawk up is 1.83 sec, our auto-shot speed with DST up is 1.6 sec, our auto-shot speed with Hawk &amp; DST up is also 1.6 sec.  And then we'd need to figure out how often Hawk would be up, how often DST would be up, and how often they would overlap (and thus subtract from the Hawk uptime).  I'm not sure how to do that last part yet.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_437234"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I just received this trinket yesterday, and so far I'm impressed with it. We did VR just after we finished Gruul, so forgive me if my experiences with the trinket are slightly incomplete.<br>
<br>
First impressions:<br>
<br>
1. It procs a lot. I didn't have Procwatch loaded or anything similar, but it definitely does proc and stay up for a remarkable amount of time. The effect is fairly obvious, looks a lot like Crusader proccing; crossed swords with a silvery halo around you.<br>
<br>
2. When I stacked haste (Rapid Fire/Abacus of Violent Odds/Dragonspine/Imp Hawk) it was certainly overkill, as my haste was far far faster than the GCD would allow me to weave shots. I'll probably replace my Abacus with Romulo's Vial (Never drops for me QQ) or the badge trinket to help mitigate this. Despite this, I would recommend it for any hunter or melee dps. The trinket is massively terrific.<br>
<br>
EDIT: Er, not to boast or anything, but I see a lot of people whining about the drop rate. We must be lucky then, because (just a quick guesstimate) out of the last 15 or so Gruuls, we've had 4 drop. First two went to warriors, third to our enhance shaman, and fourth to me (hunter). However, we have never seen the caster sword nor the shield. Our casters are screaming bloody murder over this ;-).<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Going back to the topic of actually analyzing this trinket, this little gem of a mod stumbled my path today:<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080618031336/http://wow.curse.com/downloads/details/8103/" target="_blank">Flurry Uptime Meter | World of Warcraft @ Curse.com</a><br>
<br>
This addon measures flurry up time, with an easy bit of lua editing you can have it measure up time for any effect you wish.<br>
specifically the lines:<br>
		if (arg1 == "You gain Flurry.") then<br>
<br>
		if (arg1 == "Flurry fades from you.") then<br>
<br>
Can hope the maker of this addon builds up on it and improves it to include other user defined auras through a gui/at the same time. It makes analyzing procs without cooldowns so much easier than the standard "ppm" that doesn't count back to back procs and the by hand log parsing.</div>

</div>It is a threat increase, but generally in BT/Hyjal it's not threat that is the issue, it's survivability. There have been many times that our tank has only lived because he burned dual avoidance trinkets. With proper use of misdirect and a tank that knows how to generate threat, it shouldn't be necessary. <br>
<br>
My opinion may be biased by the fact that I am a rogue, but I feel it should go to a DPS class over a tank.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_440074"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->If you think about it, every damage item increases a tank's aggro while reducing survivability.<br>
I don't think DST is much different from other such items. The only reason why a tank could want it is because it is an awesome trinket for damagedealing and so it may be worth it to use it on some farm-status encounters and trash mobs to maintain aggro more easily. But that doesn't give him the right to take this awesome DPS trinket from damage-dealers in my opinion.<br>
As you can see in my Armory, I have a DST and I'd call it my best item besides Dragonstrike and Tsunami Talisman which have great proccs as well. It's so awesome that I even use it in the arena as 2h MS because it gives such a great boost to DPS in fights against Healer/DD teams.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
Offhand, the following trinkets are ones which would technically or realistically increase TPS:<br>
<br>
- DST (AP, haste proc)<br>
- Tsunami Talisman (hit, crit, AP proc)<br>
- Bloodlust Brooch<br>
- Gnomeregan Auto-Blocker (shield block rating)<br>
- Styleen's Impeding Scarab (shield block rating)<br>
- Abacus of Violent Odds (AP, haste use effect)<br>
- Hourglass of the Unraveller (crit, AP use effect)<br>
<br>
I know this doesn't really belong in this thread, except as a comparison between the Trophy and the others; just curious if anyone can point me to another thread or website where such analysis has been done from a *tanking* perspective. Losing mitigation to gain threat is a common thing to do ... I want to see if DST actually is the best such trinket to use in a situation like that.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Is it? From what I've heard I wouldn't even consider reducing mitigation for fights like Mother Shahraz.<br>
Compare the Dragonspine Trophy to Drake Fang Talisman, they're both very good damage trinkets and obviously increase threat as well but I never ever heard about tanks going for either of them. You can only use those items for bosses you already have on farm status since it's too much of a risk reducing your mitigation on new bosses. And why should you take an item you use on farm runs over someone who would use it in every encounter he's going to fight in BC?<br>
<br>
Edit: I just saw you're a priest, you know that Dragonspine Trophy is currently the best Fury Warrior/Rogue/Enhancement Shaman/Hunter Trinket ingame? It's not one of many options you can take as a melee, it's simply the best and on the same level as the Illidan Trinket, in front of Tsunami Talisman in SSC, the class trinkets, and the Ignore Armor proccing trinket from BT which would by the way be the only good alternatives you could use.<br>
If a tank had gotten that trinket while I was in raid and not having it, I'd have probably /gquitted.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>As a matter of fact, the DFT was simply fantastic for tanking. In anything remotely threat sensitive the then-2%-hit with 56ap was godly - not to mention the 1% dodge at 60 to boot. Pairing DFT with Styleen's was something I began doing much more frequently once we had established that random burst on an encounter wasn't as much of an issue as TPS; in other cases it was LGG+Styleen's back then. The DFT was by far one of the best itemized items for Warriors period at the time imo - both from a DPS standpoint and from a tanking standpoint. Hell, I still use it on occasion.<br>
<br>
DST on the other hand I would hardly ever use for tanking - I'd love one for the encounters where I get to DPS, but I couldn't see myself ever equipping it on any high end encounter to tank. No defensive stats at all, and feeling fairly comfortable with my TPS vs. our DPSers DPS output there's just not reason of equipping it, ever.

		<div id="post_message_440217"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I used a DFT for tanking too.  People were pissed at me for taking it.  This was when Horde had no Salv (or Tranquil air even...lol?).  Hit was really hard to come by on tank gear, no sockets back then of course.  56 AP on a trinket is still nothing to sneeze at, at 70.  And topping all of that off, it had dodge too. It was an awesome tank trinket.  Its still a good trinket.<br>
<br>
I think the DST is also a good threat trinket.  There is no way the auto-blocker is more threat.  Wars throw an instant every GCD when tanking, the uptime on it would be good.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">As a matter of fact, the DFT was simply fantastic for tanking. In anything remotely threat sensitive the then-2%-hit with 56ap was godly - not to mention the 1% dodge at 60 to boot. Pairing DFT with Styleen's was something I began doing much more frequently once we had established that random burst on an encounter wasn't as much of an issue as TPS; in other cases it was LGG+Styleen's back then. The DFT was by far one of the best itemized items for Warriors period at the time imo - both from a DPS standpoint and from a tanking standpoint. Hell, I still use it on occasion.<br>
<br>
DST on the other hand I would hardly ever use for tanking - I'd love one for the encounters where I get to DPS, but I couldn't see myself ever equipping it on any high end encounter to tank. No defensive stats at all, and feeling fairly comfortable with my TPS vs. our DPSers DPS output there's just not reason of equipping it, ever. I'd probably equip my DFT over it.</div>

	</tbody></table>
</div>DFT is a good example of my statement that every damage trinket increases Threat as well, it had 1% Dodge but that's not nearly as much as compareable tank trinkets. As Alliance I don't think it was necessary back then to use it as an aggro trinket and with BC I don't think pure damage trinkets are necessary for maintaining aggro at all.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Actually that is incorrect about hunters. If I am calculating this out correctly, averaging 1 shot per second (counting both specials and white damage), we will proc this item a minimum of 4.8 times per minute (some will be reprocs, of course). A MM is allowed to move into a 1:1 shot rotation during haste procs and pick up Improved Aspect of the Hawk to supplement the haste, which gives him much greater mana longevity and higher sustained DPS. A BM hunter will occasionally clip shots when both the DST and iAotH are up, however it is still a theoretical minimum gain in total DPS of 8%. If my DPS modeling is correct, a MM build with the DST can over-take a BM for the title of Top End-game DPS. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080617134421/http://elitistjerks.com/f31/t14843-hunter_haste_rating_analysis_end_game_builds/" target="_blank">http://elitistjerks.com/f31/t14843-h...d_game_builds/</a><br>
<br>
As a side note, I am waiting on pet Glancing blows to be fixed to rework the numbers and MM DPS was being affected slightly upwards; however, I do not believe those factors could have yielded that level of difference in those builds.<br>

				The dragonspine trophy is pretty much the best DPS trinket for any class, and which scales very very well (I believe that tsunami talisman/madness are better for feral druids but not entirely sure on that due to haste rating interaction with procs). When everyone uses different systems (multiple styles of DKP or loot council systems) arguing over who should get the trinket in class-specific terms is just stupid.

</div>My sentiments exactly. Which is precisely why this whole "all melee loot belongs to rogues and warriors" mentality is so mind numbingly silly to me, and it has been around since the game began. I mean, I can understand druids not getting this, because most of the damage has nothing to do with white hits, but when its the best trinket in the game for 4 different DPSers laying claim to it being better for one over another is ludicrous.<br>

They are on the same cooldown as our mana potions (which we are requried to chain chug every 2 minutes), and as such any analysis you attempt with haste pots in the mix is going to be completely biased and totally off-base.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Indeed, but why did they do that? haste rating for melee vs casters isn't the same.<br>
<br>
Casters have their all of their spells with cast time affected by haste, destro locks and mages have atleast 80% of their damage affected by haste, while melee only have their white damage affected (true, warriors gets rage and rogues procs more combat potency, but that has nothing to do with it)<br>
<br>
anyway; I just don't see the reason behind this nerf, they just recently "hotfixed" WF, wasn't that nerf enough?<br>
<br>
Well, maybe, if we're lucky, it was a bug in the PTR that when they changed spell haste melee haste was also changed to the same value.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Incorrect.  The power of DST and Twinblades was way too high.  Haste as a bonus on the items that just had a passive +haste on them was fine; these items were generally of appropriate power for where they were obtained.  Now, with the haste nerf, most of the BT haste item drops are inferior to the drops in SSC and TK for the same slot, which makes them sort of a waste of time.<br>
<br>
I freely agree that DST was probably in need of a nerf.  But I do think it would make more sense to nerf DST (give it an internal cooldown or whatever) rather than nerfing haste rating in general.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

It's really annoying when fundamental and significant changes such as this are slipped in without mentioning them in the patch notes.<br>
<br>
In case people don't know what we're talking about, Haste rating on PTR was standardized. Melee haste rating was dropped from 10.5 rating:% to 15.7 rating:%, and Spell Haste was boosted from 21 rating:% to 15.7 rating:%.<br>

</div>Thing is, melee haste *wasn't* stupidly good.  It really wasn't.  When you work out the optimal end-game rogue gear, it included a grand total of 2 passive haste items: Shadow-Walker's Cord and Band of Devastation.  The other items with haste, while certainly good, were not disproportionately good for where they dropped.<br>
<br>
Now, DST and the Twinblade set bonus *were* stupidly good - the problem is, <b>they still are</b>.  This nerf affects a whole bunch of items that were actually fairly well balanced, but doesn't actually fix the two items that were legitimately overpowered.<br>
<br>
Upon contemplation, I think the real problem is that the way blizzard values haste procs is incorrect.  My suspicion is that they value (in terms of item budget) a 1 PPM haste proc as though it procs once per minute; for instance, DST is now believed to be a 1 PPM haste; if it *actually procced* once per minute, it'd be comperable to 54 passive haste; and a trinket with 54 passive haste and 40 AP would still be one of the best trinkets, but would be in the same league as the other good trinkets as opposed to as good as 2-3 other trinkets put together.<br>
<br>
The problem is, in real raid situations, DST is equivalent to more like 150 passive haste rating, making it vastly better than it's "supposed" to be.<br>
<br>
Hence, I think the real solution is that Blizzard needs to reevaluate the stat-point cost of haste procs.  If they took up a portion of the item budget commensurate with how often they *actually* proc (rather than how often they proc with a single weapon on autoattack), it would correct all imbalanced haste effects without needing to nerf the passive-haste items that are, honestly, roughly in the right place in terms of relative power.  Having the best rogue belt drop in BT instead of off Vashj strikes me as wholly sensible, on the whole.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I feel the change isn't really warranted. I myself am just beginning to have access to haste rating items in BT (hopefully this week, well not now...). I can understand some problems with items like Dragonspine Trophy and possibly the Warglaives set having stupidily high haste gains and seemingly many procs though.<br>
<br>
Myself, I don't have a Dragonspine Trophy. The fact I still want to go get one now that im starting Hyjal/BT is a little troubling from a balance point of view. The fact that its the best trinket in the game warrants a nerf to it.<br>
<br>
I really hope Blizzard changes they're minds before this goes live. Baby steps should be taken instead of a massive jump like this. Nerf the items that were actually legitmately overpowered like Dragonspine Trophy and the Azzinoth Haste proc. Don't nerf the haste rating items that people went outta the way to get. Its like not wanting to nerf the tailoring sets because so many people already had them, but still achknowledging they were overpowered. While on a smaller scale I bet theres a lot of people upset in Hyjal/BT who passed on a lot of stuff just to acquire this haste rating set.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Yet at the same time, given the nature of haste - it scales very well. Projecting that haste will be a nice stat on t7 or so gear is fairly sensible, given the levels of AP/damage/crit/whatever will obviously rise too - haste just makes sense.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_454075"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->The problem isn't melee haste. It's sword spec and windfury and how they interact. They realized that and addressed it. Were dagger rogues, ANY dagger rogue putting up 2.5k dps numbers like the sword rogues were? I'm asking because I don't know of any who did, but now is the opportunity to put up parses.<br>
<br>
Melee haste won't get you to that point, but sword spec + windfury + melee haste will. Take out the static haste items and I bet you could still do well over 2k dps. <br>
<br>
So, they have already hotfixed windfury. They are changing sword spec. They should leave it at that (and I agree with bumping up spell haste, though I don't think it's enough to make it "equal" to melee haste, even with the melee haste nerf) and then look at melee haste after those fixes go in.

		<div id="post_message_454121"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I really don't get too mad about nerfs to be completely honest, but the sword spec change (AGAIN), the windfury nerf, and on top of that, the haste nerf have really made me utterly furious at this game.  <br>
<br>
I know everyone has their reasons for playing this game and my only reason is to do the most damage in raids and consistantly be #1 on damage.  I do this, and I do it well, and have for 2 years now.  I just feel like whenever I complete the warglaive set, I won't even be doing my current dps on bosses with all these nerfs combined and its so aggravating.<br>
<br>
I really feel like Blizzard does not see the big picture when some of these items hit live servers and people actually start posting the results (WWS).  Also what was with the haste BUFF about 3 patches ago, now they nerf it again because the top tier rogues get perfect gear and start posting wws'?  It's a sad nerf since this hits already struggling fury and 2h warriors in raids too.<br>
<br>
Also, individual haste items are HORRIBLE now, even now using all of the melee haste items together isnt a great choice, there are some clearly superior items for every slot except the belt (for rogues).<br>
<br>
Whatever though, the proper way of doing this was to nerf dragonspine or nerf the actual haste rating on it.  As much as i love my dragonspine, it is clearly overpowered especially for where it drops.  Nerfing melee haste across the board is just STUPID.  But don't worry Blizzard doesn't listen to the 1% of people that actually don't like this change and rightfully so i suppose, 50% of the people that play this game dont know a patch is even coming, much less READ the patch notes that are associated with it.  Oh wait, this isnt even in the patch notes so it makes it even that much worse!<br>
<br>
Edit; Also what Alacrity said, we haven't done Vashj in 2 months, I sure wish I had that belt to use now.  Guess I'll settle for the Anetheron one if it ever drops .<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_454138"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->A nerf is in order, if a particular mechanism is unbalanced. Fact is, haste is neither overpowered nor unbalanced. Haste comes at a cost, the cost of lowered hit rating and attack power, and while haste initially is superior to hit rating, it will serve its purpose around 75.<br>
<br>
It is not the haste rating from gear (DST, S-WC, BoD and so forth) which really makes an impact. Getting OH from 1.5 to 1.46 or 1.44 really doesn't have much impact. It is what Slice and Dice, Heroism, Blade Furry, Haste Potions does that really makes an impact; but these elements are bursts.<br>
<br>
Nerfing Haste will cause two things: Rogues drop haste gear towards hit / crit gear, and gear dropping in BT/MH will be either par or below with items from SSC/Karazhan; and THAT is the real issue. Shadow-walker's Cord is now a worse belt than Belt of Deep Shadow, Band of Devistation is now on par with Violet Band of Master Assassin, and Dragon-Spine Trophy will be on par with Tsunami, assuming DST procs twice per minute and Tsunami once.<br>
<br>
Why make superior gear from end game instances inferior to gear from instances every lesser guild now have access to. Apart from tier6, you will not see any difference in gear from a Karazhan/SSC raiding rogue vs a rogue who has BT/MH on farm. And that really attacks the idea of progressing in gear while progressing in high end instances.<br>
<br>
This is a half brained, rather desperate, attack on both gaming mechanisms and raiding itself; and with sword specialization nerfed to insignificance now, fist specialization is the only way to go - ohh yeah, there are no fists in BT/MH.<br>
<br>
In the end, this is yet another demonstration from Blizzard, that they have no idea what they do, and just make band-aid adjustments, rather than fix problems and allow high end instances to provide gear which is superior to that from lesser instances.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>A lot of blue gear was equal, if not superior to purple in the same slot before they did the last overhaul.  This seems like a step backwards.  They already upped melee haste rating because it wasn't as good, now they are nerfing it back slightly.  They need to either lower the item budget value of 1 haste rating while increasing how much haste rating is required for 1% haste (like they are) or only target the main items in question.  I was looking forward to something more than just hit, crit, AP, but now it doesn't seem like it will really matter.  I can just go hit, crit and AP or sub in some haste for one of those stats but get the same results.<br>
<br>
And yes, Rogues should be topping the meters, because the meters don't show the raid damage increase from buffs and debuffs.  You can figure out all of that from WWS, but just looking at who is on top doesn't really show how much they contributed.  What does a Rogue really do other than DPS 99% of the time?  They don't buff the group and only a Hemo Rogue would be considered a raid buffer.  They don't really debuff anything either (they *can* use mind numbing...rarely) and only occasionally CC in raids.  Interrupts are their other main function, which isn't needed for most fights.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<!-- message -->
		<div id="post_message_454233"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Most posters here, and on other forums, try to discuss whether certain items, or certain stats are overpowered or not. This is not the issue. The only issue is *scaling*. Now scaling seems to be a hard concept to understand for most people. Even for Blizzard.<br>
<br>
It seems the dps requirement to progress through content is a linear requirement.<br>
It seems that the dps increase of casters is linear too.<br>
It seems that the dps increase of rogues (and warriors) is beyond linear.<br>
<br>
Linear means: if you get twice the stats on your gear, you will do twice the damage that you used to do.<br>
<br>
Beyond linear means: if you get twice the stats on your gear, you will do more than twice the damage that you used to do. Exponential increase is beyond linear. Rogue dps doesn't seem to be exponential. It is partially multiplicative.<br>
<br>
There was a similar problem with dps warriors. When they did more damage, they got more rage. When they got more rage, they did more damage. This effect makes the dps of warriors scales beyond linear. Changing rage mechanisms has somehow changed this. But warrior's dps still doesn't seem to be linear. Low geared warriors do crappy dps compared to casters and rogues. High geared warriors still do better dps than a linear increase. The recent WF nerf has brought warriors in top gear down below caster dps. But as soon as the next set of gear is available, warriors will get a larger dps increase than casters again. While lower geared warriors are screwed.<br>
<br>
We are seeing the same problem with rogues now.<br>
When rogue's dps scales in a non-linear way beyond caster dps, Blizzard implements a linear decrease in dps. This will bring top end rogues in line with casters. But as soon as the next set of gear is available, rogues will go beyond casters again. While at the same time, all rogues below max gear will receive a nerf.<br>
<br>
So what is this scaling problem ?<br>
<br>
Stats like +crit and +attackpower give a near linear increase in damage. Weapon damage does so too.  Double your attackpower (and weapon dps), and you will see your dps double. Double your crit-rate, and you will see a linear increase in dps.<br>
<br>
Other stats go beyond that. 5% extra hits from Sword Specialization will give roughly a 5% increase in white dps. 20% extra hits from Windfury will give roughly a 20% increase in white dps. But there is more than that. More hits from SwordSpec and WF will cause more procs, and more hits. It will cause more mongoose procs. More trinket and meta-gem procs. This is the same effect that warriors have with rage and damage interacting. The effect goes beyond a linear increase.<br>
<br>
Now add haste. Haste amplifies that effect. Haste gives more hits. More hits gives more procs. More procs give more haste and more hits. Which gives more procs. We scaled beyond being linear.<br>
<br>
The current haste nerf is a linear nerf. Linear changes will *never* fix a an exponential scaling problem. Getting a cpu that is twice as fast will give you twice the framerate in a game. But it won't give you twice the solutions for problems of O(n^2).<br>
<br>
So if nerfing haste rating in a linear way isn't good, what should have been done ?<br>
I think there are 4 issues that needed to be fixed.<br>
<br>
1) Different types of haste need to be brought inline<br>
Currently there is haste rating, and there is raw haste percentage.<br>
DST and warglaives have haste rating. So does Abacus, haste potions, mace procs.<br>
Slice&amp;dice, blade flurry, mongoose have fixed haste percentages.<br>
Haste rating scaled in a linear way. Haste percentage goes beyond that.<br>
200 haste rating (20%) + 200 haste rating (20%) is 400 haste rating = 40% more swings.<br>
20% raw haste + 20% raw haste = 1.2*1.2 = 1.44 = 44% more swings.<br>
All raw haste percentages should be converted to haste rating.<br>
<br>
2) Procs off of procs.<br>
Some procs cause extra swings. These extra swings can cause more procs. The precise rules change every patch. But the effect is that combining WF and sword spec is stronger than each effect on its own. Result: scaling beyond linear. Haste enlarges this effect. Solution: make it so that extra swings from procs can not proc more of these effects. If you want to make it simpler, then you could even make it so that extra swings can't proc poison or even proc mongoose. This nerfs rogue's dps. But at least it would keep scaling linear.<br>
<br>
3) Limit the multiplicative effect of chance-on-hit-gives-haste effects.<br>
More haste causes more hits. This gives a linear dps increase for things like white damage and poisons. But when haste procs can cause more haste procs, the overall effect goes beyond linear. It goes multiplicative. When haste is active, you can't see whether a hit is a regular hit, or an extra hit because of haste. Therefor you can't implement the same solution that could prevent procs off of procs. But there are other ways. Some trinkets (Hourglass) and meta-gems (TSD) have hidden internal cool-downs. An internal cool-down will make the scaling of these items more linear.<br>
<br>
4) Nerf the few items that are overpowered.<br>
At the moment those are DST and the warglaives. You could lower the proc-rate or lower the haste rating. That would make them less overpowered. It would still keep them scaling beyond linear. So you could introduce hidden internal cool-downs to make them (almost) linear.<br>
<br>
Making rogue's dps scale in a linear way would fix the problem. This would probably cause an overall dps decrease, which would be unfair. This could be fixed by giving some items or abilities a linear improvement, while removing all exponential scaling effects.<br>
<br>
Implementing a linear nerf while maintaining exponential scaling properties does not fix anything. When the next raid dungeon gets released, the exponential dps increase of rogues will make them seem stronger than casters again. And in the mean time, all rogues that do not have the best gear yet, will fall further behind other dps classes.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I agree, just because you picked an extremly needed narrow role you cannot argue that you should dominate by an obscene amount at that role.

		<div id="post_message_454324">It's not like non-melee classes don't have haste "on hit" procs which benefit from haste and can benefit in an superlinear manner. I know that the Ashtongue Talisman of Insight is being talked about a lot in one of the Mage theorycrafting threads.<br>
<br>
Superlinear scaling isn't necessarily a problem in and of itself. It's differential scaling between classes (and specs) which is problematic. I can't speak much for which classes scale better than others, but it's definitely not as simple as "class X scales linearly, class Y does not", unless you water down classes to a few abilities, which may or may not be safe to do.<br>
<br>
I do think it is a shame, however, that Blizzard does not always see the role of scaling behind class imbalances... and hence when buffs or nerfs are targeted at balancing players with a certain level of gear, even if those changes are effective towards the given end, they might negatively impact balance at other levels due to differential scaling. I believe that this is the source of many of the complaints at hand here.<br>
<br>
It's actually interesting to break it down into scaling of individual stats. As a caster, in terms of raw DPS increases:<br>
<br>
+crit/hit scale in a very slightly-sublinear manner.<br>
+dmg scales in a sublinear manner as well, I'm not sure if it's more than +crit/hit or the same.. it may vary by spell.<br>
+haste scales in a superlinear manner (though you'd need a ton of haste for this to really be noticable).<br>
<br>
Is this a problem in and of itself? Probably not, if only because the sublinear/superlinear scaling effects are very tiny with reasonable gear levels.<br>
<br>
But is the problem exacerbated when +X procs are improved by X? Maybe... because that leads, again, to superlinear scaling. When the proc rate of a haste effect benefits from more haste, you have scaling issues. When the proc rate of a crit effect benefits from more crit, you have scaling issues, etc. etc. And since procs tend to have more significance than passive effects, they threaten to have more noticable effects on gameplay.<br>
<br>
I think it would generally be a good idea for Blizzard to try to steer away from these kinds of loops which could get out of hand (see the Mage arcane theorycrafting thread, where people are now speculation that they'll be able to keep the Ashtongue buff up 100% of the time, which would effectively equal a 10% DPS increase using 2.2 haste figures.) While I'm a fan of creative itemization, there's really no need to go into these dangerous waters.... avoid crit bonuses proccing off of crits, haste bonuses proccing off of hit rates, etc. Or at least add internal cooldowns to these effects - which imo is a lame way to balance them, but certainly better than nothing.<br>
<br>
There's probably a lesson to be learned here.</div>

		<div id="post_message_454340">Nerfing DST might have made sense from an itemization perspective, but this addresses a larger issue than one overpowered item.  Haste rating is extremely valuable for melee classes and pretty worthless for caster classes right now.  In response, Blizzard makes Haste rating better for casters and worse for melee (making them both equally valuable point-for-point).  That makes total sense as far as I'm concerned.<br>
<br>
As a healer at least, the only piece of gear with haste on it that I want is the Blessed Band of Karabor, which is an aberration (Illidan-level drop from BT trash).  The rest of the healer haste gear that exists completely sacrifices regen for haste rating, so F that noise.  Maybe I'll craft a piece or two when we have hearts coming out our ears.</div>

</div>Not sure if there's an analysis in general, but for rogues the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302101710/http://elitistjerks.com/f31/t11882-rogue_gear_spreadsheet/" target="_blank">Rogue Gear Spreadsheet</a> does a decent job of making the comparison; 0.7.4 has the option to evaluate gear pre- and post-nerf, and what you find is that the nerf makes all the passive-haste BT drops pretty much useless, in that they're comperable or inferior to SSC/TK drops in almost all cases (the exception being Swiftstrike Shoulders, which are still only beaten by Slayer's).  In particular, post 445 has a summary of what happens to the passive haste items.<br>
<br>
Looking through said sheet a little more, one finds that there are more items than just Dragonspine Trophy and the Warglaives with haste on them that are arguably overpowered.  In particular, it seems to me that the following items are *also* too powerful for where you get them:<br>
<br>
* Blacksmithing Maces<br>
* The Bladefist<br>
<br>
This is where my "haste isn't overpowered, haste procs are overpowered" theory comes from, and a few minutes playing around with the spreadsheet.  Further inspection also reveals that the 10.5 -&gt; 15.8 nerf doesn't really change this; Dragonmaw (not Dragonstrike, Dragonmaw) is still superior to Syphon of the Nathrezim, which still seems a bit off.<br>
<br>
An additional point I might add is that the only haste proc that isn't overpowered is Thundering Skyfire Diamond, which, coincidentally, is the only one with an internal cooldown.<br>
<br>
So, to summarize: from the rogue perspective, the analysis is that the haste nerf for rogues takes all passive haste itemization and renders it mostly useless, while all haste procs remain somewhat overpowered (with the possible exception of The Bladefist).  As such, I feel a far better solution to the current problem would be to give all haste procs an internal cooldown of ~40 seconds, which would bring them into balance without ruining perfectly well itemized passive haste items.</div>

</div>I wonder how hard it would be for them to scale the proc chance for all on-hit or on-crit procs according to your current haste rating.  That would automatically subtract out the effect of haste rating on procs.  Haste would still scale well, but it wouldn't amplify all your pre-existing gear as well, which is the real issue here.</div>

</div>For enhancement shaman our testing has shown haste rating to score right in line with strength, crit rating, agility, AP and a bit better than hit rating. With this change it will drop well below hit in value and since haste items to this point feature large amounts of the stat they'll go from being small upgrades from SSC/TK items to clear downgrades. If the stat had been worth 50% more than comparable ones the nerf would be justified but since it only scores averagely any item with large amounts of it will become useless.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Not sure if there's an analysis in general, but for rogues the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302101710/http://elitistjerks.com/f31/t11882-rogue_gear_spreadsheet/" target="_blank">Rogue Gear Spreadsheet</a> does a decent job of making the comparison; 0.7.4 has the option to evaluate gear pre- and post-nerf, and what you find is that the nerf makes all the passive-haste BT drops pretty much useless, in that they're comperable or inferior to SSC/TK drops in almost all cases (the exception being Swiftstrike Shoulders, which are still only beaten by Slayer's).  In particular, post 445 has a summary of what happens to the passive haste items.<br>
<br>
Looking through said sheet a little more, one finds that there are more items than just Dragonspine Trophy and the Warglaives with haste on them that are arguably overpowered.  In particular, it seems to me that the following items are *also* too powerful for where you get them:<br>
<br>
* Blacksmithing Maces<br>
* The Bladefist<br>
<br>
This is where my "haste isn't overpowered, haste procs are overpowered" theory comes from, and a few minutes playing around with the spreadsheet.  Further inspection also reveals that the 10.5 -&gt; 15.8 nerf doesn't really change this; Dragonmaw (not Dragonstrike, Dragonmaw) is still superior to Syphon of the Nathrezim, which still seems a bit off.<br>
<br>
An additional point I might add is that the only haste proc that isn't overpowered is Thundering Skyfire Diamond, which, coincidentally, is the only one with an internal cooldown.<br>
<br>
So, to summarize: from the rogue perspective, the analysis is that the haste nerf for rogues takes all passive haste itemization and renders it mostly useless, while all haste procs remain somewhat overpowered (with the possible exception of The Bladefist).  As such, I feel a far better solution to the current problem would be to give all haste procs an internal cooldown of ~40 seconds, which would bring them into balance without ruining perfectly well itemized passive haste items.</div>

</div>agreed. Haste by itself was a good concept in that its a scalable attribute with your gear at level 70 (this will change at next expac). However it is very reasonable other than the fast that haste procs all have zero internal cooldown. Rather than nerfing the hell out of melee haste, giving internal cooldowns to said procs are much more reasonable. They have already done this to many items, so it is not a hard concept to apply</div>

</div>If the dps contribution of a point of haste rating is comparable to the dps contribution of a point of any other relevant stat how can the nerf be justified? I can only speak for my class but haste rating was definitely <b>not</b> overpowered, it was right in line with other stats, all this change will do is make the items that have passive haste borderline useless. Can rogues, hunters and warriors comment if their theorycrafting showed haste to be way out of line in value?</div>

</div>It's the same for warriors. The items with passive haste rating on them sacrifice a LOT of stats. As such they were barely (if at all) better than comparable items without passive haste on such slots.<br>
<br>
Take e.g. <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32278"><span><span class="purplename">[Grips of Silent Justice]</span></span></a> and <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32608"><span><span class="purplename">[Pillager's Gauntlets]</span></span></a>. Both BT drops. Both ilvl 141 The former was already considered to be superior or at least on par to the later. That was pre nerf.<br>
Now they're not in the same league. I'm wild guessing here, but even <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28824"><span><span class="purplename">[Gauntlets of Martial Perfection]</span></span></a> from Gruul are not a clear downgrade from <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32608"><span><span class="purplename">[Pillager's Gauntlets]</span></span></a> anymore.<br>
<br>
I have all three gauntlets, but my play time as DPS warrior is very limited, so correct me if I am wrong.</div>

As a rule, items with haste on them had no sockets.

I really don't get where people claim "stacking" haste right now is out of control.  The only thing out of control is dragonspine.

Does Blizzard think we won't use every tool at our disposal to do more damage?  Thats what rogues are designed to do, help you kill bosses faster doing whatever we can to get the job done.<br>

</div>I believe a similar conclusion can be drawn for the plate items with Haste on them, from a DPS Warrior perspective.<br>

I would agree that the issue is really that of certain haste procs being overpowered.  The DST and Warglaive for sure, perhaps the Drakefist line of maces.</div>

IIRC the ruling was out there which of the plate DPS gauntlets were the better one. I e.g. used <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32278"><span><span class="purplename">[Grips of Silent Justice]</span></span></a> and had <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32608"><span><span class="purplename">[Pillager's Gauntlets]</span></span></a> sitting in the bank (for the few occasions I tend to do damage). Could have been the wrong decision though ... in any way the difference was very miniscule. Now, it's not.</div>

</div>I've always just thought it was better because you're trading 2AP/19 crit for 25 weapon skill, and since weapon skill is itemized for the same value as crit/hit/2xAP it's just plain more stats. I don't count the stam of course because frankly I have enough HP as-is to live through anything. It also helps that the spreadsheets are supporting my claims, but that's hardly all I've gone by.</div>

The only way that the link is incorrect is if mobs have dynamic combat statistics.  While there is evidence to suggest that some mobs, of odd levels, appear to have adjusted crit/hit/dodge rates, it hasn't been proven, so it's generally best to stick with what has been proven, several times.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Indeed, but why did they do that? haste rating for melee vs casters isn't the same.<br>
<br>
Casters have their all of their spells with cast time affected by haste, destro locks and mages have atleast 80% of their damage affected by haste, while melee only have their white damage affected (true, warriors gets rage and rogues procs more combat potency, but that has nothing to do with it)<br>
<br>
anyway; I just don't see the reason behind this nerf, they just recently "hotfixed" WF, wasn't that nerf enough?<br>
<br>
Well, maybe, if we're lucky, it was a bug in the PTR that when they changed spell haste melee haste was also changed to the same value.</div>

</div>Actually hunters have all of their DPS increased with haste, so a hunter sees 100% of haste translate into his DPS. The only exception is MM with a 1:1.5 special rotation (mixing in arcane and multi to artificially boost DPS), however this rotation is incredibly mana intensive and unsustainable without a personal shadowpriest on top of constant mana potting and regen buffing at all times. Needless to say, the DST and haste allowing MM to move to a 1:1 rotation is a huge gain and allows him to become the highest Hunter DPS build. <br>
<br>
But I digress, hunters gain full benefit from +haste, and using the slow end-game bows available it is near impossible to reduce shot times under the 1.5s GCD.<br>
<br>
Now look at what haste did to rogues in the end-game: topping out at 2k DPS or more. Comparatively, mages were getting left way behind in the DPS curve as mythic has stated they are supposed to be one of the highest single target DPS right behind rogues (which they were not).</div>

</div>You're quoting really outdated information here.<br>
a) Glancing Blows have been reduced to 24% or 25% (can't remember exactly).<br>
b) The miss % is 28% and not 27%<br>
c) 0.04% per point of weapon skill may have been true for pre TBC, but is not now, at least for hit.<br>
d) It is very likely that weapon skill has an effect to dodge and crit (and maybe parry as well), but as I've said, the value is completely unknown so far (we haven't even figured out how much 1 point of weapon skill is worth for the first 5 points so far!) and therefore each and every assumption regarding it and regarding its effect on DPS is just a guess.</div>

</div>I did not point to any rogues in particular. I have seen WWS parses from a great number of rogues that are doing 2k DPS, while the highest I have ever seen from a mage was ~1500 on an AE intensive fight. <br>
<br>
Now haste being nerfed is perfectly fine in my opinion, because different classes benefit from haste in very different ways. When haste is an incredibly strong stat for some, and weak at best for others it creates a divide, especially since there is nothing comparable to stack for classes lower benefits from haste. Now that haste is comparable to hit rating, is normalizes things to the point where people have options for what they stack to see a similar gain for their class. The problem is they need to itemize it better, and in its nerfed form it will be much easier to itemize without overpowering. When haste takes over for Hit Rating as the optimum raiding stat for classes that have no limitations (mana bars), I think there is a problem. With Haste being normalized to be the same as Hit, it opens up avenues for differentiation in spec, gear, and mentality. It would simply be nice to see haste with better itemization, and I think the new dungeons might be the place for Blizzard to do that. <br>
<br>
With haste in the old form where 10.5 points equated to 1%, it would have been difficult to itemize without making haste completely overpowered, and as such you can see the items with haste having sub-optimal stats to keep the gear from being over the top.</div>

</div>Do you really believe that nerfing the hell out of haste rating is going to drop these 2k dps rogues down to 1500-1600? A lot of the ones I've seen don't even use very much haste if at all. By the way, hit rating isn't the end all stat for every melee class, for myself it's currently the <i>worst</i> way to budget items, until the haste nerf goes live at least then haste will take the bottom spot. And why should haste be the same for every class? Crit rating, hit rating and AP certainly aren't the same value for everyone.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Do you really believe that nerfing the hell out of haste rating is going to drop these 2k dps rogues down to 1500-1600? A lot of the ones I've seen don't even use very much haste if at all. By the way, hit rating isn't the end all stat for every melee class, for myself it's currently the <i>worst</i> way to budget items, until the haste nerf goes live at least then haste will take the bottom spot. And why should haste be the same for every class? Crit rating, hit rating and AP certainly aren't the same value for everyone.</div>

	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>No, but combine it with the windfury nerf and we'll see a significant decrease in rogue damage. <br>
<br>
Care to explain how hit rating is the worst way you can spend your points? Until you reach the hit cap it is the cheapest and most effective item stat to increase DPS. Only haste could beat it before, and now haste is equal to it. 15.7 item points to increase DPS 1% vs 22 is a no-brainer. Once you reach your hit cap, you now have a decision: stack crit at 22 rating per point, or stack haste at 15.7 per point. I'd take haste. The only exception comes when analyzing the entire item vs just 1 stat on said item. <br>
<br>
An overpowered stat is an overpowered stat no matter how much people are utilizing it. How many of those rogues actually would go to the trouble of crafting those extremely powerful items? Obviously not many since leatherworking is considered by and large to be worthless. When was the last time you saw a LWing rogue? Most I see are weaponsmiths. I wouldn't expect to see very many capable of crafting the T6 level Haste gear. If you actually take the time to look at it, Haste items are itemized poorly and have fewer worthwhile stats because the haste itself on the item is so powerful. If I'm choosing a ring in the old system with 30 haste and 20 agility versus a ring with 30 hit, 20 agility, and 20 crit, obviously I'm going to take the second because it is over-all a better item even if by a small margin. This change opens things up to allow for greater itemization, but if they choose to avoid itemizing haste in a useful way, then I fail to see the reason for nerfing haste when they could have easily changed the few overpowered items. However, I simply cannot see them making this change based on 2 items, and must assume that they have plans for the future of haste if they are to make this large a change to haste as a whole. <br>
<br>
Whether or not people were aware of how strong haste is also plays a very large role. I don't know if you've noticed this yet, but people are sheep. One well-known and respected person in the community does something or places a talent point somewhere arbitrarily, everyone else follows suit whether it is the most intelligent use of that point or not. They emulate that person's gear and spec choices, and you see guilds doing the same trying to copy Nihilum's raid composition whether it is the best possible mix or not. <br>
<br>
What I am saying is this: the prevalence of something does not equate directly to its strength. They want to nerf haste for melee and buff it for casters, I'm fine with it. You want to argue that different classes get different amounts out of stats, the only thing that's true for is str and agility. Crit rating, hit rating, and haste are all the same across physical damage classes, and the same applies across magical damage classes. Agility comes in different amounts for different classes based on gear and focus, and has different strengths based on talent spec and what affects their damage. As such, things like agility and strength have to be balanced on a class-by-class basis. What kind of crit rate will a hunter or rogue see that gets lots of agility on his gear if it were normalized to what warriors/shaman get? Well over 50-60%. That would be overpowered. Meanwhile a the shaman/warrior are down around 20-30%. The stats are different because they are itemized differently for the classes. Hit rating, Crit rating, and haste on the other hand are not itemized differently based on class. All physical classes generally have equal access to the three stats, and as such they have equal impacts on the classes. <br>
<br>
The problem here is that the same iLevel points were not being applied to casters in a way that made haste, or any other stat, a comparable DPS upgrade. So you had a divide between casters and melees. As icing on the cake, casters take a substantial hit to their mana longevity to stack haste, while rogues, warriors, and shaman do not. This is the same argument used for the nerfing of windfury, and to be honest I see exactly where casters are coming from. Why bring a mage when you can stack 4+ rogues, 2 shaman, and 2 dps warriors in their respective DPS groups? <br>

</div>You have nothing to back a statement about hasting being well balanced, so trying to call out evidence to the contrary strikes me as quite hypocritical. If anything the strength of the DST and Glaives are evidence enough. Even if they were nerfed to 1PPM they would still be more powerful than any comparable item based on the fact that haste has the same iValue as crit and hit, which allows for it to make a much larger impact. As we all know, Blizzard creates items based on level and stat distributions. If they were to make a large number of end-game items with haste, the actual DPS increase would be much larger for a piece of gear with the same iLevel. Obviously that was a fairly debilitating limitation for item generation when you are already increasing the strength of items beyond the prior tier.</div>

</div>No, the strength of the DST is evidence that haste procs were undercosted. It's an important distinction to make - the Dragonspine Trophy gives <b>325</b> haste rating. It's counted as a point of hit/crit, yet something like <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32492"><span><span class="purplename">[Ashtongue Talisman of Lethality]</span></span></a> only provides 145 crit. Same with the Warglaive proc - those specific procs are too cheap, and the proc-increasing nature of haste is what pushes them from "very good" to "way too good." Ordinary haste rating, however, doesn't have that problem. No matter how many timers I pop, my gloves are still only going to give me 37 haste.<br>

		<div id="post_message_455545">Excuse me, I was not aware that shaman have some mysterious mechanic that causes hit rating to be less worthwhile to them than it is to every other class. The shaman AEP valuation shows haste to be the #1 DPS stat in its pre-nerfed state. The hunter AEP calculations show the same, as do the rogue and warrior valuations. Prior to haste, the #1 DPS stat varied from class to class. The valuations you just linked to me reinforce my point that haste was too powerful for all physical DPS classes.  You claim it was 'balanced' while the actual DPS contribution from haste is calculated at a much higher value than anything else for physical DPS, while haste for casters was by far the worst stat across the board. I fail to see how you can argue against a nerf to haste, or claim that it was simply one or two items that were overpowered when haste was valued so highly by every single one of us. <br>

</div>I could have sworn I had already proven that haste increases hunter DPS substantially in my Haste rating thread, where moving from 1:1.5 to 1:1 for a MM with DST and haste had substantially higher DPS. If you want to argue over semantics be my guest. <br>
<br>
Pets gain from haste my increased number of crits over X period of time. Technically the only stat pets really "gain" from is AP, and as we all know, AP is the least valued of all hunter stats for every build. Pets gain nothing from Hit Rating, yet it is still the highest valued damage stat for hunters short of haste (I'd prefer to avoid the MP5 and int debate here).</div>

But once again don't take my word for it, feel free to test it for yourself. They may not be perfect but they're a hell of a lot better than your gut instinct. I know which one I'll put more value in.<br>

				Excuse me, I was not aware that shaman have some mysterious mechanic that causes hit rating to be less worthwhile to them than it is to every other class. The shaman AEP valuation shows haste to be the #1 DPS stat in its pre-nerfed state. The hunter AEP calculations show the same, as do the rogue and warrior valuations. Prior to haste, the #1 DPS stat varied from class to class. The valuations you just linked to me reinforce my point that haste was too powerful for all physical DPS classes. You claim it was 'balanced' while the actual DPS contribution from haste is calculated at a much higher value than anything else for physical DPS, while haste for casters was by far the worst stat across the board. I fail to see how you can argue against a nerf to haste, or claim that it was simply one or two items that were overpowered when haste was valued so highly by every single one of us.<br>

You guys wanted evidence? Well you just provided it for me. Thanks.

		<div id="post_message_455558">If haste is so worthless when you get to T6, why would you care so much about it getting nerfed? If different classes are to value stats at different levels, again I ask, why do you care if something that was clearly overpowered for most classes gets nerfed? Congratulations on turning the topic of haste to be entirely about shaman and no one else. I stand by my point that haste in its current form is far too powerful. Maybe you want a special case to be made for shaman to keep it as is, but seeing as how both hit and crit give the same amounts across the board, I don't think you are going to be successful (THAT was my point about hit/crit having the same value, ie: 22 CR for 1% for all of us, I am well aware that 1% crit affects everyone in a slightly different manner). <br>
<br>
Fine, I was wrong about shaman getting the biggest return out of haste, I do not bother researching them because I have never had a need to, so excuse me for making generalizations about physical DPS across the board (before someone hops in about druids, I am well aware they gain less from haste than most). However, Rogues, Hunters, and Warriors (with the exception of slam spammers) all gain an incredible amount with haste. When it gets to the point where classes would gain so much more by stacking haste over everything else, there is a problem. At least with Hit rating there is a cap on it's effectiveness, so one cannot simply stack it ad naseum over other damage stats. Whether or not these people were utilizing the haste is another story, and has no bearing and is not evidence to "haste being a poor stat choice." <br>
<br>
You can have your argument about shaman not getting much out of haste, but once again, why should a haste nerf have anything to do with you if it is such a poor stat?<br>

</div>Yes, Haste increases Hunter DPS. I am not arguing this.<br>
Contrary to your claim, 100% of Haste does not translate to DPS (especially for procs), due to using abilities which are not affected by Haste.<br>
When it comes to this trinket especially, you have a set amount of time where you're under the influence of a Haste effect. When you, under this effect, choose to use an ability not affected by Haste (e.g. Arcane Shot / Multi-Shot, both more damaging options in most cases), some Haste will be lost. Additionally, as far as I know, the Auto Shot cooldown of 0.5 seconds is not affected by Hastes. When a lot of Hastes are flying around, you will delay shots, again reducing the benefit to less than 100%.<br>
 <br>
I know full well that a lot of this is more pertinent to BM Hunters. As an example:<br>
The DPS loss (post-nerf compared to pre-nerf) for this trinket is much greater for other specs. In other words, for BM Hunters, 100% of Haste does not translate to DPS. If it did, we'd see a much larger gap pre- and post.<br>

</div> The pet gain from our Haste is very small, which is why I said 'close to' nothing. Again, this is especially true with the trinket in question in this thread. Extreme hastes, like the one you can get with this trinket = very high chance for focus gained on crits to be wasted/not being used fast enough. Pet global cooldown is a limiter.</div>

</div>My whole point was that it isn't worthless <i>right now</i>. Currently it's a good stat, not quite as good as str but pretty even with crit and clearly better than hit. If the changes go through as planned it will become worthless. And since I've already collected several pieces of it, which included leveling LW I'm a little peeved at having the rug yanked out from underneath me. By the way, I'm still waiting for your evidence that haste is "clearly overpowered" for other classes. I mean you just keep repeating it, but that doesn't make it true.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">If you understood itemization half as much as you think you do you'd see what a terrible pointless example that is. Your first ring spends 50 stat points, the second spends 70 so of course it's the superior item. To simplify, when an item designer is making an item each "stat" costs 1 point, that includes agi, str, int, spi and crit, hit and <b>haste</b> rating. Stam costs 0.66 per point, and 1 point will also buy you 2 ap. Don't take my word for it though go to your favorite item database site and use those values to add up items of similar ilvls they'll score roughly equal, even the ones with haste.</div>

</div>Davia is talking about stat weightings for dual wield fury. Haste is a useful stat, roughly about as good as crit. The problem for warriors is that a lot of our haste gear is very narrowly focused in stat distribution. Belt of seething fury and swiftsteel bracers are the perfect examples, all they have is stamina, strength, and haste. So when you reduce the effectiveness of haste by 33%, these items that are already modest upgrades over the T5 crafted pieces become downgrades. I've stacked passive haste up to almost 20% and seen no extraordinary dps gains over stacking crit and strength. If this rating change goes through I'll probably go back to using T5 level pieces in place of my current bt/hyjal level haste gear in several slots.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I am well aware of how iLevel stats are taken into account and iLevel on items. My example may have been poor, but I was trying to make a point about how poorly haste items are actually implemented, which the poster above you speaking of warrior haste gear has made a much better example of. Your 2 page long flame about how I do not understand iLevels is off the mark, as it is very easy to see stat valuations simply by looking at the trend gems follow. Yes, it was a much too hasty example on my part as I did not actually account of iLevel in it, but if you compare the bands of devastation to rings with the same iLevel, you will find the stat distributions are much better for most other rings from a DPS standpoint. <br>
<br>
The fact that you repeated almost verbatim my sentiment about mages not getting the same investment out of haste as though you were contradicting me indicates to me that I probably did not state my position as clearly as I could have. My point is if a mage had 20 points on haste on an item and a rogue had 20 points on the same item, the mage gained far less of an actual DPS increase while spending the same iLevel points. <br>

In the T6 gear level a hunter with hastes out DPSes one without by anywhere between 8-15%.

Every class has stats that aren't very useful to them, and for shaman its going to be haste. Big deal, you can gain the same amount of benefit from other items so you will not see a change in DPS.

				<div style="font-style:italic">If haste is so worthless when you get to T6, why would you care so much about it getting nerfed? If different classes are to value stats at different levels, again I ask, why do you care if something that was clearly overpowered for most classes gets nerfed? Congratulations on turning the topic of haste to be entirely about shaman and no one else. I stand by my point that haste in its current form is far too powerful. Maybe you want a special case to be made for shaman to keep it as is, but seeing as how both hit and crit give the same amounts across the board, I don't think you are going to be successful (THAT was my point about hit/crit having the same value, ie: 22 CR for 1% for all of us, I am well aware that 1% crit affects everyone in a slightly different manner). <br>
<br>
Fine, I was wrong about shaman getting the biggest return out of haste, I do not bother researching them because I have never had a need to, so excuse me for making generalizations about physical DPS across the board (before someone hops in about druids, I am well aware they gain less from haste than most). However, Rogues, Hunters, and Warriors (with the exception of slam spammers) all gain an incredible amount with haste. When it gets to the point where classes would gain so much more by stacking haste over everything else, there is a problem. At least with Hit rating there is a cap on it's effectiveness, so one cannot simply stack it ad naseum over other damage stats. Whether or not these people were utilizing the haste is another story, and has no bearing and is not evidence to "haste being a poor stat choice." <br>
<br>
You can have your argument about shaman not getting much out of haste, but once again, why should a haste nerf have anything to do with you if it is such a poor stat?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
That is exactly what I said, if you took the time to actually read my words we wouldnt be having quite this big an issue.</div>

</div>When you act like an ass about mechanics, it helps to be right about them. It also helps to not make excuses about being wrong about them. You've already had people respond and tell you that haste isn't optimal for Enhancement Shaman and Warriors. You've had priority of shots for Hunters wrong.<br>
<br>
Of course the haste nerf influences us. It's not an optimal stat, but since we don't get to choose the distribution of stats on gear, it impacts our gear choice, just like +dodge on rogue gear did. That should be obvious.<br>
<br>
I'm undecided on the reasonability of the haste nerf, but your arguments are absurd.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Currently it's a good stat, not quite as good as str but pretty even with crit and clearly better than hit. If the changes go through as planned it will become worthless.

</div>Well it seems to me that the problem hasn't so much been melee scaling too well as much as casters just haven't scaled enough. I know many of ours complain that their DPS stats have only increased marginally over the tailoring gear they had shortly after reaching 70, at least compared to our melee and hunters. Maybe if negative resists came back that would help, giving spell penetration some real value. But looking back now the coefficient changes for mages and the sp/warlock nerfs probably weren't needed. I always suspected those nerfs had more to do with the tailoring gear being too well itemized than with the classes themselves being overpowered. Lets hope they're not making the same kind of mistake with melee haste right now.<br>
<br>
I also do think DST probably needs to be looked at, I love mine dearly but it really is too good for just a trinket slot. The warglaives might need tweaking as well but keeping in mind they're a legendary set they should probably be very good.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_455865"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->While casters got some coefficient nerfs melee got some buffs directly (glancing) and indirectly (less cleaves etc) since the start of tbc. Removing the coefficient nerf for mages will put em quite a bit higher, 10% of 1200-1500dmg (not-buffed/buffed) times all the % modifiers is quite a big difference.. like popping 2 flasks.<br>
<br>
The crafted tailoring sets were really strong, with the tailoring set + some random items you would be around 900-1000 +fire dmg for a mage. The only hard part was to get enough hit on the rest of your items.<br>
<br>
Nowadays mages are around 1200-1300ish general spelldmg (can go a bit higher) but it's easier to cap hit. The gear we get now is more about getting int/sta/spir and not that much focused on extra dmg (compared to straight up +fire/arcane on spellfire). Tailoring didn't have much stats which resulted in the evoc whines, but at the same time were really efficient on the dmg stats.<br>
<br>
For the tier pieces to come close to how good tailoring items were they have to make different +dmg sets, like a fire set for fire mages.. arcane for arcane. Other classes already can turn in pieces for different spec sets, so why not make it for the more basic classes as well. This will suck when you want to switch spec ofcourse, but it's the only way of upping the dps by a lot. Dropping random stats for dmg stats would help as well, but the tier sets always were the balanced items and you would just add random cloth to get extra dmg instead of stats.<br>
<br>
Generally rogues win in dmg, but i don't mind. It's just that sometimes they seem so far ahead that i can't even dream of doing that much dmg even with the biggest crit streak. On another note, BM hunters seem to get ridiculously strong as well with the gear they get now. That is with a cat, not the cheesy scorpion.<br>
Hope this isn't too much of a whine post, but some information about scaling <br>
<br>
Waiting for the next itemization round is not really a solution, cause the same thing will happen again. Maybe blizz won't introduce new tailoring sets and all the casters will be behind from the start with no hope to get even or past the melee. If they want to fix it they can just look at how all the classes turn out now at the end-game and fix it.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_466635"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I was doing some testing on trinket values for enhancement shaman and it was suggested I post the DST results here as well.

<br>

				I just finished testing DST uptime on the PTR(then on live for comparison) and according to my 30min test the proc rate has been lowered substantially. I measured 22.79% uptime over the 30mins. That seemed pretty startling so I repeated the test on the live realms and with identical gear and testing as close to the same as I can manage it scored 41.88%. I 'm sure the sample is small enough for there to be some pretty significant variation, but I'd be surprised if that much of a difference came down to chance.<br>
<br>
For the testing I swapped out all my passive haste and haste-proc gear so the haste nerf itself should have a fairly minimal impact in the results. Here's the screenshots:<br>

<br>
I don't have the combat log but I am almost 100% sure the trinket has a 20-25 second internal cooldown on the test server. I never saw the buff refresh itself during that test, and on live servers it happens all the time.<br>
<br>
This is just a rough estimation, but using the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080316031515/http://elitistjerks.com/f31/t11882-rogue_gear_spreadsheet" target="_blank">Rogue Gear Spreadsheet</a> and cutting the value of this trinket by 40% (in addition to the haste rating nerf), it still appears to be the best trinket by far. <br>
So yeah, like the above poster said it was only a matter of time.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I can't say for rogues but I know for shaman it's no longer the best. The Ashtongue trinket and the one from the council will both be better, the changes put DST about equal with the one from Leo. Since rogues get a little more value out of haste and a little less out of ap, I'd suspect they're in a a similar position.

</div>IMO it's more because there are a distinct lack of epic quality options in the trinket slots. If you think about it, what trinkets are available? Kara, theres romeo's vial (haha yay) then the only other epic quality trinket before Black temple (for all classes minus rogues) is tsunami and the threat one off vashj which is mediocre at best.

		<div id="post_message_467244">What bothers me about the changes to haste and DST so far is it's all being done at once. The nerf to DST wasn't surprising, it was perhaps too good for its position in progression, but it seems to be that it was designed as such, given the total lack of other trinket options from pretty much Gruul on through BT. Such an item is not without precedent, things like LGG and Reguv Gem come to mind.<br>
<br>
So they nerf it, fine, we can then test that in a real raid setting, see how it works out. But no, they nerf haste effects across the board as well, changing gear priorities entirely. We're now in a situation where we are essentially playing an entirely different game as melee. Where once we said X stat was more valuable than Y unless under certain circumstances, and gear was itemized as such, we now say X stat is not worth sacrificing Y unless under circumstances unattainable with current itemization.<br>
<br>
I hate to be a whiner about nerfs, but this one seems rather short sighted. We've all seen the WWS of Twin Blades of Azzinoth rogues tearing up the meters, and pulling numbers that really couldn't be considered balanced. But is the fix for that making most of the unique gear from BT and Hyjal worse than gear from a tier below it, making months worth of gear selection choices useless, and forcing us to re-equip almost entirely? I think not.</div>

		<div id="post_message_467246">This is a new and original point.<br>
<br>
Counterpoint:  Haste is still a fine stat.  The problem is that the haste items from BT/Hyjal are horribly itemized.  Put haste on an item with sockets and a mix of haste/AP/+hit for example, and suddenly you have a good item.  Almost all the +haste items that are now inferior are socketless items that barely spread their budget around.  That's the problem.  The fact that those items used to be the best in the game despite being horribly designed is because melee haste was too good -- it was strictly than any other possible use of budget, point for point, which makes no sense.  There should be tradeoffs involved.  Redesign the haste items, with haste at 15.75, and they can still be just fine.<br>
<br>

		<div id="post_message_467256">I absolutely agree with you, I wasn't trying to play off the arguments made against the haste nerf as something new and my own, they've been stated numerous times here and on the WoW forums. Rather, I was trying to say the haste nerf, combined with the DST nerf that, while may have been expected, was only recently shown to actually be on the PTR, is perhaps too much. Not that either one taken separately are unreasonable, but together, the effect they may or may not have on raid selection and certainly gear selection is a bit extreme. Perhaps the math models and internal QA team say it's not too big, but when numbers like 50% nerf, and 33% nerf start getting tossed around, people become concerned.<br>
<br>
With the patch coming out in the next couple weeks, it's likely far too late for any significant changes to be made. If it does turn out to be too severe of a nerf, things may be changed in 2.3, like itemization updates, as you mention.</div>

</div>This simply isn't true for warriors and shaman; haste is <b>not</b> the best way for a T6 geared player to spend item points. Don't get me wrong, it's a solid stat pre-nerf but to say point for point it's the best stat is just false. Were the new value balanced those items would still be competitive with non-haste alternatives. The nerf is severe enough that haste is now the <i>worst</i> way to spend item budget for those classes, that's why those items are now looked down upon. <br>
<br>
I don't know the details on how effective haste was for rogues or hunters, maybe it's still good for them, but that won't be true for the other physical damage classes.</div>

</div>Well as someone else mentioned when the trinket is so ridiculously overpowered that you can nerf it into oblivion and its STILL the best trinket, then there is something wrong and a change was needed. The bad thing is that one part of the nerf almost makes every passive haste item from BT totally shit. &gt;.&lt;</div>

		<div id="post_message_467374">Exponential scaling.<br>
Flat nerfs.<br>
<br>
I'm in a slow guild. That started raiding past Gruul only recently. Maghteridon down 8 days ago. VR down 6 days ago. Lurker almost down yesterday. I picked up a DST 4 days ago. I'm in Karazhan/T4 gear.<br>
<br>
On some single-target fights I do good damage. Still mixed with mages, warlocks and hunters. On other fights (like the Lurker), my damage is a lot lower than ranged dps. This has always been the case for melee dps, they have more positioning requirements, need to dodge aoe more, dodge cleaves and whirls. As a result, we used to get more single-target dps.<br>
<br>
The balance between ranged and melee dps was completely broken when TBC was released. many rogues rerolled. I personally didn't come back to the game until 2.1. Many Karazhan groups refused to bring rogues. After the 2.1 buf the majority of rogues (in blues or Karazhan gear) were at par with ranged dps again. The exponential scaling factor made it so that after a certain point rogues scaled better than intentional. The fix should be a fix for the exponential scaling. (Yes, O(n^1.01) is also exponential scaling).<br>
<br>
Now we are getting flat nerfs. This will bring the dps of T6 rogues back onpar with T6 ranged dps. However, it lowers the dps of T4 rogues by enough so that they will be considered useless again. Maybe we won't be the mana-sponges that we used to be pre-2.1. But the lackluster dps in static single-target fights, and the below-par dps on other fights, will bring us back to the situation of pre-2.1.<br>
<br>
Now you might consider this a whine-post. But my point is: you don't fix exponential scaling problems with linear solutions.<br>
<br>
In another thread people report that they think proc-rates are now changing with haste changes. So that ppm stays ppm, regardless of the current weapon speed. If that is the case, then it remains to be seen what procs will be affected by this change. If all procs are affected, then even things like poison procs or windfury procs will get reduced, as rogues usually always have s&amp;d up.<br>
All these nerfs together are becoming huge overkill. Especially for T4-level rogues. Not fun.</div>

</div>(Emphasize mine.)<br>
For warriors it was not the case as you make it to be. The (haste) belt/bracers/shoulders and gloves were not univocally considered the best against (better itemized) alternatives for the slot. They were adequate. Even with massed haste stats (that you consider best prenerf for melee) passive haste items were not overpowered per se. They were on par.<br>
Now they are clearly not.<br>
<br>
And keep in mind that DST was nerfed (understandable). Melee haste gets nerfed.<br>
<br>
And now some tests appear that indicate that haste does not beget procs. If it is really changed the way the tests by the OP indicate, and proc chance does consider the <b>current</b> weapon speed (hasted and all), then in fact haste negatively affects effective PPM values (via the instants). See <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304071815/http://elitistjerks.com/f31/t15553-proc_per_minute_mechanics_haste/" target="_blank">http://elitistjerks.com/f31/t15553-p...chanics_haste/</a> for referance.<br>
<br>
As you certainly know, a multitude of concurrent changes can result in an unintended synergy. This is not the correct procedure to change a stats value. <br>
Just as weapon skill stat was once fine by itself (as a PvE stat), and the itemisation was horrible wrong, Blizzard <b>seems</b> to overreact to voiced change wishes.</div>

</div>That is just not true.<br>
I'm not saying anything about other classes. You are probably right that they don't deserve it. I can not judge, as I don't know as much about shaman or warrior dps as I know about rogue dps.<br>
<br>
But saying "rogues need nerfs" is non-sense too.<br>
Some rogues need nerfs.<br>
Some rogues don't.<br>
<br>
I am a rogue in T4 gear. In some fights our rogues out-dps mages, warlocks and hunters. In some other fights the mages, warlocks and hunters out-dps us. I don't see rogues at T4 being overpowered compared to the other dps classes. There is no justification to nerf all rogues in a flat way. And that is what is happening now. It's the exponential scaling at T6 level that needed to be fixed. All rogues below that get punished now.<br>

</div>Ok, so maybe any procs that have a straight percentage mentioned in their tooltip will not be affected by a nerf ? Like poisons and windfury. But maybe all the procs, trinkets, meta-gems, enchants, etc, that don't have a specific percentage mentioned will be affected by these 2 nerfs ? 1) hidden cooldowns, 2) procrate reducing under haste. That's still pretty bad.</div>

</div>I'm sorry - but I really don't see a problem with rogue damage being scaled back a touch.  I'm still in mostly T4 gear.  I have a SSC Sword (Talon), PvP S2 OH and SSC belt.  A non-SSC raider can replace the Sword with the PvP S2 MH, and the belt from Gruul or Treachery from Kara.<br>
<br>
I'm leading the DM on every single fight, and in many cases by a large margin.<br>
<br>
This isn't epeen stroking, this is just how rogues are right now.  Sure you could say that the other dps in my guild sucks, but I don't think that's the case, as comparing WWS parses from guilds with the same gear, you see similar effects.<br>
<br>
If you have DST, and are currently not destroying everything in your path, then you probably need to evaluate how you're structuring your dps cycles, positioning, gemming or some other factor such as general fight strategy.</div>

</div>While I agree with the sentiment that scaling needs to be looked at, can we please stop throwing around words like "exponential scaling". I havent seen any proof or even indication that rogues scale in O(x^n). There was an assumption that haste proccs could scale in a non linear manner but with it now being shown that increased haste reduces PPM that is no longer the case.<br>
<br>
Rogues scale better than other classes but they arent scaling exponentially by any means.</div>

		<div id="post_message_467467">SSC and TK fights are, in general, more caster friendly than melee friendly, especially if you use certain tactics. All the AoE fights (i.e. Hydross dependant on strategy, Morogrim, Solarian) automatically bias themselves towards mages and warlocks. Karathress has a number of short range nuke/stun effects. Leotheras has Whirlwind which disadvantages melee a lot more than casters. Lurker has a significant drawback for melee (threat cap, especially on adds). Al'ar just screws over melee in p1. Kael phase 1 is 50% melee unfriendly to the point of sitting over in a corner afk. Vashj is generally melee unfriendly too (roots, p2, static charge). <br>
<br>
SSC and TK are clearly both biased directly away from melee, and yet (in general) melee hold their own. Once you move out of SSC/TK the fights start to become very melee friendly, or caster unfriendly (first 3 in Hyjal, Teron, Gurtogg (no moving in/out in general), RoS (zero armour), Shahraz (hi casters)). The effect of gaining haste gear and moving from melee unfriendly/caster friendly into zones where the fights are melee friendly/caster unfriendly is quite phenomenal. The raid game seems to have been balanced at the point where people leave SSC/TK, as at that point our melee were starting to slightly edge ahead, even on the melee unfriendly/caster friendly fights. If you're smart in where you position yourself to maximise DPS time and use bloodlust at the right point, you can do extremely well with the melee synergy that is in the game. <br>
<br>
This is why you get what you call "Exponential scaling" while the rest of us are arguing that it's not exactly clear cut. The fight mechanics make it very hard to tell just what is going on, apart from rogues being obviously at the wrong point in T6 content.<br>
<br>
<br>
When you get to the T6 level and see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304071815/http://www.lossendil.com/wws/?report=2ichpb2upqn4q&amp;s=2503-2738" target="_blank">rogues doing 50% more damage than anyone else in the raid</a>, it's pretty clear the balance is out of whack. From my experience and WWS parses I've seen, it's mostly rogues who are over the line. Everyone else is pretty well balanced, with the exception of particular fights for particular specs, which is just a "strength vs weakness" argument rather than things being amazingly out of balance (arcane mages on RoS as an example).</div>

</div>As I've posted before, I don't mind if Blizzard fixes the scaling being better than linear. I don't mind if they nerf the two haste items that are most overpowered, the DST and the swords from Illidan.<br>
<br>
But since 2.1 they have nerfed sword spec (yellow-&gt;white, no procs of procs), windfury, flat haste nerf. Now they are introducing hidden internal cooldowns on many items. But if they indeed are adjusting procrate on the fly regarding current weapon speed, that gets really beyond what I can accept. It goes against everything rogues have done over the last 2.5 years. Every rogue knows to keep slice&amp;dice up. Stacking haste was a nice strategy if you knew something about your class. I know many rogues (with better gear than me), who always follow these rules: "BT loot &gt; Hiyal loot &gt; TK loot &gt; SSC loot &gt; Karazhan loot &gt; any blue loot". They don't think, they don't compare, they just take the loot dropping from the hardest boss.<br>
<br>
I always liked it that you could compensate lack of gear a little bit by picking the right gear. All these nerfs basically make it so that the simplistic rogues are right when they say "BT &gt; Hiyal &gt; etc".<br>
<br>
How does the haste nerf affect me ?<br>
<br>
There is another thread about pvp weapons. And how hard it is to get a good pve mainhand weapon.<br>
<br>
I was at over 25 Garr kills. Saw one Brutality blade drop, and was very lucky to get it.<br>
I was at over 25 Onyxia kills. Never saw a Vis'Kag drop.<br>
I was at 10 Chromaggus kills. Never saw a CTS drop.<br>
I was at 10 Fankriss kills. Never saw a AQR drop.<br>
There is was, at the first bosses in Naxx, with my mighty Brutality Blade.<br>
After I left the game, my guild split up. 2 guilds, both killing Chrom and Fankriss for 3 months. Combined they got one AQR and no CTS.<br>
<br>
I have a Vindicator's Brand. Got it the day I hit level 70. I killed Netherspite a few times, and never saw a Spiteblade. My guild doesn't do Kazzak.<br>
<br>
I have learned from this. I don't expect to get a decent mainhand sword ever in this game. I'm not gonna wait for Morogrim to drop me a sword. Besides, it will take a while till we get there. And I'm not the only rogue.<br>
<br>
I'm not gonna wait for it. I had decided to go blacksmithing and make a Dragonmaw/Dragonstrike. Those are good maces, and the haste proc balances the drawbacks that those maces have no others stats, and that mace spec is sub-par compared to sword spec.<br>
<br>
I have done 4 weeks of arena games. I'll pick up my offhand sword on wednesday. I really dislike pvp. I refuse to act as content for other players. I am not gonna go through 8 more weeks of shitty pvp for the mainhand sword. If I have to do that, I rather go play another game. (BioShock is waiting).<br>
<br>
Well, it turns out my reply turned into a whine-reply. Bye bye cruel world, I'm probably gonna get banned now.<br>
<br>
But for me, these haste nerfs, and proc-rate nerfs all come together with the choice of my mainhand weapon. Now that we can expect Dragonstrike/Dragonmaw to be on par with my Vindicator's Brand, I'll be doomed to keep using my Vindicator's for a few more months. Like I have done since I hit level70. I guess I'll have to follow the same strategy as every other rogue: spend your dkp on T5 gear, and get pvp swords.<br>
<br>
I feel more pushed into a "middle of the road" position in a game, then I feel that pressure in real life.</div>

</div>I'm sorry, my mistake. I didn't mean exponential (O(2^n)) but polynomial (O(n^2)).<br>
<br>
The way it used to work, rogues scaled better than O(n). And you should realize that exponential does not only mean O(n^2). Even O(n^1.001) is polynomial.<br>
<br>
There is a ceiling to proc-based haste rating. And that is when you have so much haste that all your haste items are proccing constantly, giving you a 100% uptime of all your haste-effects. Then the scaling goes back to a flat line. Someone called this a "S-curve" before. However, we haven't reached that yet. So for me, and my limited mathematical lingo, scaling beyond linear is called polynomial. Maybe there is a better term ?<br>
<br>

</div>Yes, I've read that only  a few days ago. And this is another noticeable nerf. All nerfs together give rogues a substantial reduction in their dps. Which was maybe necessary at T6 levels. But I don't see the need to nerf rogues at T4 level. (Except nerfing the DST itself).<br>

</div>The scaling graph of rogues is curved. When you compare it to the graph of other classes. And probably also when you compare it to the graph of dps required to defeat harder bosses. That makes it beyond linear. Polynomial is the only word I know to describe it.<br>
<br>
Introducing internal cooldowns reduces the polynomial effect. The reduced proc-chances under haste reduces the polynomial effect too. A flat haste nerf does not. I don't understand why they had to do the flat haste nerf, when the other two, in combination with a DST/glaives nerf would have fixed the problem. They are just throwing all possible solutions at the problem, and doing huge overkill.</div>

</div>What you have stated, has NOTHING to do haste nerfs. It is just a whine about how badly the dice roll has screwed you over in terms of PvE weapon, which I can relate to, but does not help your argument.<br>
<br>
At your current standing in progression, there are 2 items that actually affect you, which are Dragonspine Trophy and the Dragonstrike Mace chain. Before 2.2 nerf, Dragonspine Trophy beats every trinket in the game, by a gigantic margin. Dragonmaw (the middle tier mace) was better than EVERY weapon in black temple, save for The Twin Blades. Do you really think it is justified that a Tier 2 Black smith weapon, with item level lower than Prince Malchezzar's drop table, should be more powerful than every other epic weapon in the game? Even as it stands right now on test server, Dragonstrike is STILL fine in terms of its place on loot progression: You can use it all the way through at least Kael'thas and Vashj. For Dragonspine Trophy, it is STILL the best trinket in the game, just not by huge margins anymore.<br>
<br>
If you have further reasonings and evidences to back yourself up, feel free to. But so far what I have seen are whinings backed up by no evidence even from other threads. I do feel that they have gone a bit much with haste nerfs, but not by such a large margin that you have shown, especially when you don't even have access to most haste gear yet.</div>

</div>Well, now I'm worried about the collateral damage to other classes. I'm 100% based on a PPM mechanism here, to the degree that a significantly lower DPS weapon is better if it has that last .1 or .2 weapon speed.<br>

Counterpoint:  Haste is still a fine stat.  The problem is that the haste items from BT/Hyjal are horribly itemized.  Put haste on an item with sockets and a mix of haste/AP/+hit for example, and suddenly you have a good item.  Almost all the +haste items that are now inferior are socketless items that barely spread their budget around.  That's the problem.  The fact that those items used to be the best in the game despite being horribly designed is because melee haste was too good -- it was strictly than any other possible use of budget, point for point, which makes no sense.  There should be tradeoffs involved.  Redesign the haste items, with haste at 15.75, and they can still be just fine.<br>
<br>
And of course DST was too good.  Everyone knew it was too good.</div>

</div>I agree with Gurg, they were terribly designed, based upon a single stat that was only so powerful because of the stacking effects of it with other attack-speed increase effects (Slice and dice, flurry, blade flurry, procs).<br>
<br>
There are still some examples of the haste itemization that are strong pieces. Dragonspine is, obviously, one example even with the newly surfacing internal cooldown.<br>
<br>
I also would not complain at all were someone to give me a pair of the swiftstrike bracers, because it's still probably a flat 3% (2% white, maybe 1% yellow) DPS upgrade from the haste alone, whereas with hit or crit socketed into Deadly Cuffs or Insidious Bands, you'd only wind up with about 1.25% white-DPS increase, and a marginal yellow DPS increase from increased combat potency procs.<br>

Shadow-walker's Cord, Grips of Damnation and Swiftstrike shoulders? Yeah, those are now relatively useless compared to comparable items, but Haste has not, in and of become a useful stat, and I'm sure that if it weren't for the min/maxiness of the haste items (ie. no hit, no crit, little AP, little agi, boatloads of stam), we would be kinda annoyed  by this, but not so much as seems to be the case with the present situation.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>If you refer to a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080615042443/http://elitistjerks.com/f31/t9816-hunter_spreadsheets_development/p27/#post466407" target="_blank">link Lactose posted</a> further down the PPM mechanics thread, it indicates that pre-2.2 hastes are not affecting Proc rates based on testing Cheeky and others did with Don Santos' rifle. They did not come to a definitive answer as it was discovered late in the thread, but the theory and analysis look solid. <br>
<br>
Since I have the Mark of Conquest, Don Santos' rifle, iAotH, and a few haste items I can take a long test run at Dr. Boom this coming weekend to see what I find on live servers (assuming 2.2 does not go live before I get a chance to do this). If there is an undocumented change in the way haste affects PPM it would certainly be a fairly big change for melee and archery. However, based on the findings in the spread sheet analysis thread it would seem that procs on the PTR may be acting the same as they currently do on live.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Tested a couple things:<br>
instants still proc weapon enchants- Shived til mongoose procced with no auto attacks. Yay.<br>
Mongoose procs went up with only auto attack and sinister strike but ppm went down when running slice and dice.<br>
<br>
I have to go back and do a larger sample but if I can believe procwatch (annoying since I cant click off mongoose to catch the refreshes) then instants are unaffected by this change but there is indeed a very real problem with haste causing an actual drop in proc rate.<br>
<br>
PPM increased from using 1 weapon with mongoose to using 2 so the ppm isnt linked or anything silly like that. I'll get a large sample tomorrow hopefully.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Sometimes nerfing is necessery. It is often easier, and a better way of restoring balance. You often read posts saying that developers shouldn't nerf classes, only buff others to the same level, but that logically can't always work. <br>
 For example - everyone agrees that rogues were doing far more damage than other equivalent classes at the tier 6 level. If they raised every other class up to that standard of damage, they would have to rebalance the entire raid content spread at tier 6, as it would be trivialised by the huge gains in dps every raid would get. So, nerfing rogues is the logical step to take.<br>
<br>
Morally, it's nice to be able to say "Nerfing something to bring it in lin with something else has never been good news". Practically, and in the context of the bigger game, sometimes it is necessery.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I'd have to agree that, by the looks of WWS mind you and not first hand experience, rogues in T6 needs adjustment (nerf), my comment was aimed specifically at nerfing PPMs in relation to haste and daggers vs sword/mace/fist.<br>

Making sword/mace/fist rogues worse to bring them in line with a spec that needs attention is not the right way of doing things.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I think the issue here is not that rogues need a nerf, but that this nerf may have side effects that you would be fairly safe to assume the developers are not aware of. It also impacts a specific type of rogue (daggers) more than the SS spam specs. I.E. The nerf is needed, but might be going about it the wrong way. Of course as it is not yet confirmed how haste affects PPM, this is still all pure conjecture. <br>
<br>
I agree completely that sometimes it's necessary to nerf rather than buff to restore balance.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Your math is flawed. An assumed 2% increase in white damage and 1% increase in yellow damage do not equal a 3% total DPS increase. But something between 1% and 2%, depending on your white/yellow ratio.<br>

I despise the mindless buff things to match overpowered circumstances motto people through around. Sometimes a Nerf is what should be done, and buffing the underpowered aspects is not. I am also extrapolating here, I am not saying that Inkm is falling under the situation I just laid out.

</div>Notice I mentioned "If"<br>
<br>
Also, just to clarify. Chance to proc is (PPM/(60/Speed of weapon)). So with a 2.0 mainhand and a 1ppm, you'd see  (1/(60/2)) = 1/30 = 3.333 chance to proc per hit.<br>
<br>
With a 1.0 speed it would be 1/60 = 1.667 chance to proc per hit.<br>
<br>
With the 2.0 speed MH you would have 3.333 per SS to proc "Outside the white ppm". With SnD active the chance would be reduced to (1/(60/1.4)) = 2.333% chance to proc.<br>
<br>
Thus reducing the procs we'll see by quite a lot. Depending on how much haste you have you'll see a drop of ~30-45% in total procs if this goes live.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Another thing. The cooldown of 20 seconds being thrown about. Usually I start counting the cooldown once the affect fades, I guess that may be incorrect. However, from the log when I was testing a few minutes ago:<br>

		<div id="post_message_468497"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->1) Internal cooldowns are generally stated from proc start to proc start.  So the cooldown on this bugger is 20 seconds, meaning that no two procs can start within 20 sec of each other.<br>
<br>
2) What does this mean in practice?  Well, previously, the average time from start of one proc to start of the next was about 14 seconds for a combat sword rogue.  This has been increased to 14 + 20 = 34 seconds.  Now, since some of the procs overlapped pre-nerf, the actual loss of DPS isn't the factor of 2.5 implied by that calculation; however, it drops it from ~52% uptime for a sword rogue in a sustained DPS situation down to ~29% uptime, which is a fairly significant nerf.<br>
<br>
3) That said, even with the 33% effect nerf and 45% uptime nerf, it's *still* clearly the best rogue trinket.  Which means a) there's a reasonable chance it'll get nerfed yet again, and b) it very much needed a nerf to start with.<br>
<br>
Personally, I'm hoping they increase the internal cooldown to ~45 seconds, do the same for the warglaive set bonus, and revert the haste nerf.  But we'll see what happens.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>A change from 14 sec to 20.5 sec per proc is not a significant nerf. However, you just got lucky on that proc. If the average time-to-proc stays at 14 sec after the PPM change (which I'm doubtful of, to be honest), then you're now looking at an average of 34 sec to proc the trinket, as opposed to the previous 14 sec. Its effective PPM rate is more than cut in half.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_468516"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->The lower uptime you saw on Live servers could be explained by the generally accepted theory for ppm-procs. Your instant attacks were getting a lower proc chance because of the faster weapon speed (dagger).<br>
As for the 32% on PTR: I just went back to make sure nothing was changed and I found an uptime somewhere around 25% again, so I'm not sure how there could be such a large difference between the other 3 tests and yours.<br>
<br>
The 20 second cooldown is just something I guessed by manually observing the buff on the PTR. The quickest refreshes were around 21-22 seconds after the previous proc and never faster than 20 seconds (or 10 seconds after the effect expired).

The first DTS went to a hunter in the guild and there was alot of fuss from the rogues being that DTS is probably the best rogue trinket in the game. The hunters on our forums say that DTS will increase their total dps (as BM) by upto 15%. <br>
<br>
I was wondering if anyone knew rough number range of how DTS will effect combat rogues (swords/daggers) and if it really is significant increase over how it effects hunters. Hunters on my forums are also saying that clipping really isn't a bad thing and a hunter (BM) with .1s lag can incrause their dps by 100+.<br>
<br>
Any help would be appreciated.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>If you take it on a class by class basis, you end up with "this is the best trinket in the game for rogues" and "this is the best trinket in the game for hunters". What he seemed to be asking for was clarification on whether it actually is good for hunters, and I merely stated that it's the best trinket for any physical DPS class as of this point in time. <br>
<br>
That aside, yes rogues gain the most advantage out of it, but that's partly due to their ridiculous DPS in the first place. It's an amplification trinket rather than a set damage trinket (haste scales a lot better than other stats in general for rogues, and rogues, especially non-dagger, have a very high percentage of white damage) so it's a substantial gain to whoever is your top DPSer.<br>
<br>
Obviously, taken in context, if your hunters are outDPSing your rogues by 200-300 DPS, it should probably go to a hunter for pure min-maxing RDPS. Or just give it to a rogue and slap them round the face 'til they learn how to DPS properly.<br>
<br>
It would of course be nice if it dropped more often. We've still only ever seen one.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I have yet to see an analysis on the DST across all classes that was not flawed in some way or showed a definitive "winner" that determines who gets the most out of the DST. The problem with most of them is that people know their own classes very well, but start trying to analyze other classes without a full understanding of them and do not have a solid grasp on how the other class works (which you can see me doing earlier in this thread like a moron). <br>
<br>
I would like to see each class fully analyze their own total DPS increase from the DST, and once we have that we can compare everyone's results across the board. We have to keep in mind that if a rogue saw a 5% increase in DPS, then they would probably beat out an 8% increase from hunters because their base DPS is already much higher, and the DST only applies to the hunter's personal damage rather than their over-all damage.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>This isn't entirely true. There are lots of proc-based things (<a class="itemlink q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=31323" target="_blank">[Don Santos' Famous Hunting Rifle]</a>, Go For theThoat, etc.) that directly translate into increased pet DPS as well. Also, for a Hunter this trinket will, in most cases, increase both white and yellow damage. For MM/Survival Hunters it has a nice side effect of improving mana efficiency through dropping from a 1:1.5 rotation to 1:1. Or increasing the benefit from Judgment of Wisdom. The hunter spreadsheet <i>should</i> be accurately accounting for all of these things.<br>
<br>
I think if you want to look at allocation from purely a raid-DPS standpoint, give it to the Hunter or Rogue who is doing the most damage without one. They are probably more likely to get a higher % of the potential this trinket unlocks.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Much higher? Depends on your level of progression. Pre-BT, rogues and hunters can be entirely comparable. The difference is a maximum of 20-25% for personal dps - hunters hover around 950-1050 + pet, and rogues hover around 1150-1250. You could make the argument that BT scales it even more, which is true, but using your percentages and those figures ...<br>
<br>
Hunter: 8% = 80 dps<br>
Rogue: 5% = 60 dps<br>
<br>
Hunter wins.<br>
<br>
Now, scale the rogue up over 1450 personal dps, and keep the hunter fixed, and then the biggest upgrade goes to the rogue. But I have yet to see a WWS of a rogue breaking 1450 dps in pre-BT gear. I'm not even sure it's possible without gimmicks -- multiple heroisms, etc..<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_472115"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Well, raiding hunters that are interested in DPS maxing are currently spec-ed BM, not MM, so in terms of min-maxing, the benefit to MM hunters is interesting, but not to your guild really. <br>
<br>
And a random haste proc for hunters can be something of a mixed blessing. Clipping is a real hunter issue and not conducive to dps maximization. Dynamically altering what you're doing based on a random proc is not an entirely easy thing to do optimally.<br>
<br>
For rogues, the DST is retardedly simple to gain the full benefit from. You don't do anything differently other than perhaps wait till the DST procs again before smacking Blade Flurry. You are keeping up SnD ahead of all anyway.<br>
<br>
I'd be very reluctant to give this to a hunter over a decent rogue in a loot council. I'd be very annoyed with a guild hunter that took it over me playing my rogue. I'd be annoyed if I as a hunter of melee shaman couldn't use my DKP to take the trinket if I wanted it and had the points. But if the rogues were still without it, I might consider spending my points elsewhere in the meantime. I mean if there is spell damage gear with crit on it while I raid on my shadow priest, I kinda like to make sure the mages that want it all have it already before I make my move. Crit is largely wasted on me, even if the piece is otherwise an upgrade. In fact, spell hit is wasted on me until I can get enough to re-deploy a talent point so I treat hit gear similarly.<br>
<br>
Even with the nerf, rogues are going to want this thing badly. Hunters generally value it somewhat less highly. If they want it, however, and are comparably skilled to your rogues, well, you probably shoudn't do anythign extraordnary to stop them from getting it too.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Problem with hunter DPS is that you need to be VERY lucky to have good hunter in guild. Normal hunters do 600-800 dps (yes with pet). Good hunters will do 1000-1200 but are almost impossible to get.<br>
<br>
On the other side rogues doing 1000+ are easy to get as there are more of them and mastering rogue is just much easier.<br>
<br>
And that is pre-BT, hunter scale like shit and is blowed up by rogues in BT. Therefore it is better to "invest" DST in rogue.<br>
<br>
Anyhow we got 3 DST, 2 went to dps warriors (both are not raiding now), one went to ench shammy (that quit soon after). Next one will go to dps warrior too as he have saved dkp for that since forever. Problem is it will never drop and we don't do gruul anymore anyway. Well not much to care about with incoming 2.2 nerfs it will not be THAT THAT much better anymore so I think I will stay with tsunami + warp coil until next expansion.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

- BM hunter doing 1385 dps<br>
<br>
Note that both of these kills, our rogues were not giving an Enh Shaman (he's away for 3 weeks), so had to settle for a resto. We're currently working on Kael, and neither of those hunters has more than 3 pieces of T5 (just to give a scale).<br>
<br>
It's good to see that 1500 dps is doable from rogues. That does make the balance lie slightly toward rogues over hunters, assuming the 5% / 8% thing is actually correct (it isn't, most likely).<br>
<br>
Just wanted to show that hunters aren't as useless as most people have experienced. We have *very* good hunters, and they earn their raid spots through top-notch dps.<br>
<br>
Our DSTs have gone to hunter, rogue, rogue, just in case someone was curious. <!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Well, raiding hunters that are interested in DPS maxing are currently spec-ed BM, not MM, so in terms of min-maxing, the benefit to MM hunters is interesting, but not to your guild really. <br>
<br>
And a random haste proc for hunters can be something of a mixed blessing. Clipping is a real hunter issue and not conducive to dps maximization. Dynamically altering what you're doing based on a random proc is not an entirely easy thing to do optimally.<br>
<br>
For rogues, the DST is retardedly simple to gain the full benefit from. You don't do anything differently other than perhaps wait till the DST procs again before smacking Blade Flurry. You are keeping up SnD ahead of all anyway.<br>
<br>
I'd be very reluctant to give this to a hunter over a decent rogue in a loot council. I'd be very annoyed with a guild hunter that took it over me playing my rogue. I'd be annoyed if I as a hunter of melee shaman couldn't use my DKP to take the trinket if I wanted it and had the points. But if the rogues were still without it, I might consider spending my points elsewhere in the meantime. I mean if there is spell damage gear with crit on it while I raid on my shadow priest, I kinda like to make sure the mages that want it all have it already before I make my move. Crit is largely wasted on me, even if the piece is otherwise an upgrade. In fact, spell hit is wasted on me until I can get enough to re-deploy a talent point so I treat hit gear similarly.<br>
<br>
Even with the nerf, rogues are going to want this thing badly. Hunters generally value it somewhat less highly. If they want it, however, and are comparably skilled to your rogues, well, you probably shoudn't do anythign extraordnary to stop them from getting it too.</div>

	</tbody></table>
</div>I would be annoyed if you were in my loot council. I gained over 100DPS (with DST) from my WWS on sustained DPS fights. I have several posts in hunters threads showing "before/after" WWS links.<br>
<br>
The trinket is single handedly the best trinket in game (even post nerf) for hunters. With my tests on the PTR, I havent noticed much of a nerf. The haste nerf doesn't really affect BM since we are limited by the 1.5 sec global cooldown. THe new haste numbers (with a 2.9 sec wep) put me right where I want to be and not clip shots. Previously I was slightly clipping with DST. So I could actually see a bit of a buff. I also (after over 1 hour of DR. Boom combat) am noting as a BM it is almost always re-procing in the 20-40sec range. Now that it doesn't proc on top of procs, I think I will not be seeing "wasted procs". 20 sec cooldown seems like a blessing in disguise. I can now safely use rapid fire (right after a proc finishes) without worrying about it being wasted. Thats even more time I can be hasted. So it appears to me the PPM on the DST is basically the same for BM with nerf. With less wasted procs. The haste nerf affects melee dps, but not a BM due to the global cooldown being our limit anyways. So IMO it actually is better for a hunter then a rogue (post nerf). However, I say give it to who has the DKP as long as they are a good DPS'er. I hate hearing guilds giving this to only rogues. Talk about short sited. Do some research. This trinket is very high on most hunter's lists.<br>
<br>
Edit: Here are the WWS links as they havent expired yet:<br>

</div>I could provide a WWS of myself in blues/Karazhan/T4 pre-WF nerf breaking 1800 on Tidewalker. Gear has progeressed since then, and Windfury has changed, but 1500 dps in that gearing stage is more than do-able if conditions are met.<br>
<br>
Edit: As far as the Rogue vs Hunter vs Anyone else debate, for our guild we decided that due to our Rogues being the backbone of our raid's dps that the Trophey would be going to them first. Our hunters are traditionally... less than optimal as far as min maxing, gearing, and preformance so giving them to our hunters was never even really a consideration. In addition, our one great hunter had deemed that the trinket due to its random proc rate and non consistant haste would do more to hinder his shot cycle than would do him good. Being unable to time the haste with QS, I guess was his primary concern. I'm sure however if we had still been doing Gruul he would have picked one of them up at least to test. A few of our DPS warriors picked them up after our Rogues had theirs, to round out how we've given them out.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
It's certainly a bit of a love/hate with my DST. I'm an aussie BM hunter, so with 450-500ms in raids, temp haste buffs can really piss me off at times. Then again, when DST procs when IAotH doesnt proc, its amazing. I get almost full use out of the haste. It is still great even with BL or IAoTH, but every time it happens it reminds me just how fucked hunter shots are atm.<br>
<br>
At the moment (up to Sharhaz) I am usually topping dps above rogues/locks, aside from encounters where I am kiting/tanking/etc, or some other restriction. Najentus, Teron, Souls, and similar tank/spank fights, our rogues are usually behind me and sitting around our marks hunter, just above the Survival. Whether or not that is because of me having DST and no rogues having it.. I'm not sure. Ive only ever seen once drop, my own ~6 months ago.</div>

This WWS parse does not include damage while ghosted.  I had one other person in my group with drums of battle, so they were up approximately 50% of the time.  I was also in an absolutely optimal group setup.  I had an enhance shaman, a battle shout and a feral druid, although I believe both the drood and warrior got ghosted at some point before the end of the fight.  The warrior also was an arms warrior, so I was getting an extra 4% damage there.<br>
<br>
On Morogrim, with a resto shaman, and either LotP OR battle shout (we often run with 3 rogues), I usually pull 1350-1400 single target dps (we aoe the murlocks away from morogrim).  I'll try and find a parse for this.<br>
<br>
It is <i>very</i> possible for a rogue in pre-BT gear to pull out numbers in the 1400-1500 range with an optimal group.</div>

- Survival hunter doing 1370 dps<br>

<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071231133035/http://www.lossendil.com/wws/?report=3p261aqj4n5ze" target="_blank">Wow Web Stats</a><br>
- BM hunter doing 1385 dps<br>
<br>
Note that both of these kills, our rogues were not giving an Enh Shaman (he's away for 3 weeks), so had to settle for a resto. We're currently working on Kael, and neither of those hunters has more than 3 pieces of T5 (just to give a scale).<br>
<br>
It's good to see that 1500 dps is doable from rogues. That does make the balance lie slightly toward rogues over hunters, assuming the 5% / 8% thing is actually correct (it isn't, most likely).<br>
<br>
Just wanted to show that hunters aren't as useless as most people have experienced. We have *very* good hunters, and they earn their raid spots through top-notch dps.<br>
<br>
Our DSTs have gone to hunter, rogue, rogue, just in case someone was curious. </div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>I was throwing out numbers as an example, I have not seen an analysis from rogues yet, so I really have no idea what kind of gain they see. All I know is I plugged it into their spread sheet once and saw a 2.5% DPS increase, but I do not know how accurate that is (and 8% is accurate for BM hunters. Up to 15% for MM - and the DST can make MM a better raid spec than BM because it creates a mana efficient rotation in conjunction with iAotH, though post-nerf we will see).<br>
<br>
As for the way we determine who gets this item: whoever has the DKP to get it, does. But our officers are kept informed by class leaders (and most of the officers are class leaders anyway) about bad decisions on loot. If a rogue that can barely do 600 DPS wanted this over one of our other DPSers that regularly breaks 1k, we would stop that from happening. Currently we have 2 shaman and 1 rogue with it. I'm pretty low on the totem pole for DKP, but I would push for our MM to get this item next since he has the DKP and he would benefit a lot more than anyone else at this point.</div>

</div>The biggest difference between the two spreadsheets seems to be that they disagree on items with haste rating and procs. The rogue gear dps sheet seems to give more worth to items like Dragonstrike Trophy and Dragonmaw/Dragonstrike. If you had checked the rogue gear spreadsheet, you would have seen more than 2.5%. With my gear (T4 level), switching from Hourglass to DST gives a 10% increase.<br>
<br>
A simple estimate for the effectiveness of the DST for a rogue.<br>
DST gives a 30% haste increase.<br>
Assume 50% uptime.<br>
Assume a combat rogue does 65% white dps, and 5% poison dps.<br>
DST means that 70% of his dps will be boosted 15% on average.<br>
That is an overall 10.5% increase in dps.<br>
On top of that, there will be more combat potency procs for more sinister strikes.<br>
And there will be 15% more procs like Mongoose, Dragonmaw/strike, meta-gem, etc.<br>
<br>
This should show that a DST is at least a 10-11% increase for any rogue.<br>
Not 2.5%.</div>

Now, scale the rogue up over 1450 personal dps, and keep the hunter fixed, and then the biggest upgrade goes to the rogue. But I have yet to see a WWS of a rogue breaking 1450 dps in pre-BT gear. I'm not even sure it's possible without gimmicks -- multiple heroisms, etc..</div>

So if Rogues are seeing 10%, it is fairly comparable to what Hunter's currently see (spec dependant of course), and a BM will actually be capable of making full use of the DST post-nerf which should remove what little gap there currently is between a BM and combat rogue. So if rogues/hunters are seeing similar gains, then I would agree that it should go to whichever can make the most use of it. I'd hate to see it go to anyone that can't break 700 DPS heading into SSC and TK.</div>

</div>The Rogue Gear sheet values haste proc items more because it has a more accurate model of how they work, I believe.  However, I have no updated that sheet with the new findings regarding haste and procs yet, so the value of those items will be coming down somewhat.<br>
<br>
Also, the sheet is not updated to include the forthcoming Dragonspine Trophy nerf, so the value of it will be dropping as well.<br>
<br>
Hence: while I do believe that historically the haste items were as good as indicated by that sheet, the values are likely to come down significantly with the incoming changes to the class.</div>

The only PPM proc tested in that thread which improved with haste was Fiery Weapon, tested by a rogue.  Unbridled Wrath and two trinket procs, tested by a warrior, and <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=31323"><span><span class="purplename">[Don Santos' Famous Hunting Rifle]</span></span></a>, tested by a hunter, did not see increased procs per minute with haste when tested on Live.<br>
<br>
So, either there's class dependent stuff going on, or some (old?) enchants see benefits from haste, while other (newer?) enchants and items do not.  But there is no evidence showing different behaviors between Live and the PTR.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">As it stands my guild has 3 gruul kills under our belt so far. Most of the time on Gruul's we have 2 hunters (sometimes 3) in the top 3 dps spots then followed by a mix of the other DPS classes (usually depends who is on their A-game that day as well as the group setup they have). <br>
<br>
Apparently we are very lucky because all 3 of our Gruul kills has resulted in a DST dropping. The first two went to hunters ( myself included) and the third went to our highest DPS rogue. The rogue is dagger specced however, and I have read that DST is best for combat rogues. Would it be worth him respeccing to take better advantage of the DST's proc or would it probably not make much of a difference?</div>

	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>3 DST's from 3 kills? DAMN.  In my old guild we saw 1 DST in 4 months.  In my current guild they saw 2 in 5 months.  Considering he drops 2 items out of ~14 every week, getting 3 in 3 weeks is very extraordinary.<br>
<br>
Having a DST go to a hunter over a rogue does hurt.. if they two are equally skilled players, your guild will see more benefit from it by putting it in the rogues hands.  A crappy rogue vs a very well played hunter, ok.. I can see the merit in giving the hunter DST.  Oh, and yea.. dagger spec means he is combat.  Unless of course he is Mutilate..  Check his armory, if he's 15/41/5, he's combat daggers.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Just a note on the damage increase for rogues.. a few corrections to the post a little above mine:<br>
<br>
30% haste, 50% uptime - average of 15% haste (good starting point)<br>
65% white damage (yep)<br>
5% poisons (yep - but deadly poison should be fully stacked always anyways, haste won't make it tick faster or get higher stacks)<br>
25% Sinister Strike - affected via combat potency<br>
5% rupture - not really affected, unless the rogue struggled to keep rupture up without the haste<br>
<br>
*Note* Those numbers can vary a bit, rupture should be in the 7-8% range, upwards of 9% if the rogues doesn't have windfury.  White damage will shrink a bit without windfury.  Poison dmg will shrink a bit as the rogue's stats increase.  (no amount of AP, crit, hit, etc makes your deadlies tick higher).<br>
<br>
15% * 65% white = 9.75% increase (this already incorporates more sword procs)<br>
poisons stay the same<br>
rupture stays the same or goes up a hair - count it at no change<br>
<br>
15% more combat potency energy:<br>
base is 10 energy per second.<br>
1.5spd OH = 40 attacks per minute<br>
SnD up 100% = 1.15 speed = 52 attacks per minute<br>
DST proc = 0.88 speed = 67.6 attacks per minute<br>
Extra 15 OffHand attacks per minute while hasted.  We assumed 50% uptime, thats an extra 7.5 attacks.  20% chance to proc Combat Potency, so an extra 7.5 * 0.2 * 15 = 22.5 extra energy per minute.  Thats half a Sinister Strike.  Most rogues get about 19-20 SS's per minute otherwise, so a 2.5% increase in sinister strike dmg.<br>
25% of total * 2.5% increase = 0.625% increase<br>
<br>
So yea, 10.5% increase in damage for a rogue seems about right to me.<br>
<br>
<br>
For hunters, as far as I understand it you basically get auto steady auto steady auto steady etc.  If you toss in Multi shot or arcane shot, well those are on a fixed CD and won't be affected by haste, so the auto/steady rotation is what will show the biggest increase in dps.  Reducing the time your auto takes effectively makes your steadies happen that much more often, assuming your auto doesn't go below the 1.5sec GCD (plus latency).  Thus, all of the HUNTER's damage is theoretically affected by the haste, but the pets damage remains pretty much static.  What percentage of a hunters damage is caused by their pet?  Yes, I realize BM and Marks will have different answers.<br>
<br>
That said, even if the hunter gets the same 10% dps increase a rogue gets from DST, proc-based haste really IS a mixed blessing for a hunter.  Any time that auto shot dips below 1.5 sec, you lose all benefit of the haste.  Not to mention it is a lot harder for a hunter to vary his shot timings to achieve maximum benefit from the haste, as opposed to a rogue who.. really doesn't do anything differently (in general).  Meh, even if the hunter and rogue will see the same theoretical percentage increase from DST, and do the same dps pre-DST.. give it to the rogue unless another outside factor (raid attendance, etc) suggest otherwise, just purely based on the fact that a rogue will ALWAYS get max benefit from haste, while a hunter will not.</div>

</div>Depends on the fight, but generally a BM sees 20-30% (40% with the scorpid bug) from the pet, and a MM seeings around 15-20%. How much benefit a BM sees is dependent on other hastes thrown into the mix, and their weapon's shot time. <br>
<br>
Here's the analysis of the DST on hunter builds (first post is T4, 2nd is T6) - just be aware this was done at 0 armor, so rather than picking over the DPS numbers themselves look at the ratios and percentage increase: <br>

Stick with rogues..thats what you know. Don't try and say you know what it does for a hunter. I have gained over 10% damage increase as a BM, would be even more as a MM/SV. The trinket is equally viable for both classes. IT IS NOT BETTER for a rogue. You just calculated a 10% increase. I got more then 10% as a BM. The GC issue is averted by the fact a SV/MM will not get there unless they stack alot of haste. A BM as well (especially post nerf) with a 2.9-3 ish speed bow. You talk about us having to adjust rotations when it procs making it less efficient? A BM hunter only does steady/auto, when it procs i continue to steady/auto...whats to change? I don't change a damn thing when it procs. I get the same benefit a rogue would spamming whatever. <br>
<br>
I have posted my before/after WWS logs showing my increase. How about some rogues do the same? So far all I have heard is theorycratfing. Not that I don't think rogues get a good benefit from it, would just be interesting to compare.<br>
<br>
Regarding who it is best for I think we are splitting hairs. I hate hearing people cry that this trinket should only be theirs...talk about greedy. It is awesome for alot of classes. Deal with it.</div>

</div>As BM, you're already coming very close to clipping your shots when your IAotH and DST procs are active, and practically speaking you probably are, due to latency.  Nobody's arguing that hunters don't reap a massive benefit from haste.  They're saying that classes with no diminishing or negative returns from stacking haste get more benefit, especially as they stack more and more of it.

</div>The point is whethere i clip or not (and post haste-nerf I won't be) I gained over 10% increase in DPS. In fact I can show you some logs which make me think I gained closer to 15%+ just from the DST. I still haven't seen anything but theorycrafting from rogues and that theorycrafting says about a 10% increase.<br>
<br>
I don't care if I only benefited from 50% (post patch I will be benefiting 100% BTW) of the trinkets haste. The bottom line is the % increase in one's DPS. Both classes are looking at double digit % increases with this trinket. Saying one class deserves it more is idiotic.</div>

</div>No need to get all hostile about it.  It's not about who deserves it more, merely about where it's more effective.

Naturally, in 2.2 this will no longer apply to the extent it does now, but that doesn't change the fact that for the last 7 months, the DST was <i>incontravertibly</i> the most effective (read: the most net DPS increase) in the hands of a good rogue.  You can't really argue with the WWS reports of rogues with the trinket doing 1500+ DPS pre-BT, and 1600-3000 DPS with varying degrees of Hyjal/BT gear.

</div>If a hunter is already able to maximize his DPS, argueing that: "the hunter doesn't deserve it because shot rotations are tough," is attributing a mechanic our hunter friend has already overcome as the reason for being held back. That really does not make any sense to me. Any hunter breaking 1k DPS knows their rotation, they are capable of timing their shots, they have the tools to make themselves successful. They are already capable of getting everything out of their class that they can. To tell a hunter that he cannot have the DST because you do not believe he can make full use of it, when that hunter has already proven himself, strikes me as fairly ignorant. <br>
<br>
What hunters are saying is that this belief currently held about us not making full use of the DST while other classes can, is just plain false. A rogue can, at best, use 65% of the DST. A Hunter can at best use about 85% of the DST (and then some, given that more shots = more crits = more procs from Kill Command and Go for the Throat, among other things). If an item is just as powerful for Hunters as it is for Rogues, why would you keep Hunters from getting it, unless it was about greed under the guise of fair play?<br>
<br>
If you claim the DST does more in the hands of a rogue than a hunter, you had better believe that we are going to ask tough questions. I do not see how requesting proof about something that is currently being withheld from a class by numerous guilds is too much to ask. You say it is better in a rogue's hands, I'm still waiting for evidence that it is actually true.</div>

</div>You fail at reading comprehension.  I didn't say hunters couldn't make full use of the DST, or that they didn't get a massive benefit from it.  I did say that haste rating is nowhere near as valuable to a hunter as it is to a rogue.  Hunters can only stack so much of it before they start getting negative returns.  This won't happen with just a DST, true, but with IAotH, QS, and the 20% BM haste, not to mention any other haste rating items, it will.  Rogues don't have this problem.  I can stack DST, Slice n Dice, Blade Flurry, Bloodlust, Abacus, etc ad nauseum and I can only benefit.  The only cutoff point is 0 speed.<br>
<br>
You're underestimating the usage a rogue gets out of just the DST, as well.  You say 65% because that's the normal percentage of a rogue's total output that is white damage.  You neglect to mention that if the DST only buffed white damage output, that white:yellow damage ratio would be much, much higher.  Combat rogues have this awesome talent called Combat Potency.  Maybe you've heard of it.  20% chance on any offhand hit to regenerate 15 energy.  More haste = more offhand hits = more energy = more yellow damage.  Pretty neat how that works, right?<br>
<br>
Maybe you've also heard of weapon procs.  I don't know, it's not something hunters have to worry about. Lucky fellows!  Mongoose procs 120 agility, which is, wait for it, 120 attack power and 3% crit.  Per proc; it can also stack.  When it stacks we have a whopping extra 240 attack power and 6% crit.  Guess how it procs.  That's right, off weapon swings.  What does haste buff for a rogue, again?  Oh yeah.<br>
<br>
Anyway.  It's great for hunters.  It's great for rogues.  I already have one, and so does every raiding rogue in my guild, so it's not like I'm arguing about this because I'm jealous of those bastard hunters stealing my DST.  It's just irritating (and actually somewhat amusing, because it's basically just a few hunters bitching; everyone else has a brain) seeing post after post of people saying crap like "zomg i dont' believe dst is better for a rogue than a hunter because hunters can use it too and anyway i do 5 million dps with it and the rogue in my guild who's specced shadowstep and has it too only does 20 dps so obviously ist better for hunters so there and if you want to prove me worng don't just shove math in my face because i'm too fucking stupid to understand it, i want you to go back thru every combatlog you've ever saved and compare and contrast your damage now with vs your damage then and all your hunters damage too because i'm just too goddamn lazy to bother listening to people with a fucking clue."<br>

<br>
read it and weep. this hunter is in T5 with the trinket doing 2085 dps. I can find more if you want. Hunters can dps with the trinket with the best of them. I would like to see how many T5 DST rogues hit much better then that.<br>
<br>
The math involved and proof through WWS shows this trinket gives hunters as much as a 10-15% dps increase. Just as viable as any rogue got pre nerf even. <br>
<br>
Just cause some guilds have allocated this trinket to rogues only doesn't make them right. Far from it actually.</div>

I already have one, and so does every raiding rogue in my guild, so it's not like I'm arguing about this because I'm jealous of those bastard hunters stealing my DST.  It's just irritating (and actually somewhat amusing, because it's basically just a few hunters bitching; everyone else has a brain) seeing post after post of people saying crap like "zomg i dont' believe dst is better for a rogue than a hunter because hunters can use it too and anyway i do 5 million dps with it and the rogue in my guild who's specced shadowstep and has it too only does 20 dps so obviously ist better for hunters so there and if you want to prove me worng don't just shove math in my face because i'm too fucking stupid to understand it, i want you to go back thru every combatlog you've ever saved and compare and contrast your damage now with vs your damage then and all your hunters damage too because i'm just too goddamn lazy to bother listening to people with a fucking clue."<br>
<br>
And stuff.</div>

</div>There is no need for you to get defensive and start throwing out insults. You still have not shown that a rogue gains a larger amount of pure DPS from the DST than a hunter. We currently have theory-craft on the potential percentage gains from both hunters and rogues. The max potential damage a Hunter can see is 15%, while the max potential damage a rogue can see based on all this math I aparently do not understand, is 10.5%. And we have WWS of a BM Hunter, who has the least to gain from the DST of all Hunter builds, increasing by 10-12% in DPS from 900 to over 1000. What we do not have is a WWS of a rogue doing the same as Tict. <br>
<br>
As for a hunter not doing 1500+ pre-T6, this is Cheeky in mostly T4: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071230224312/http://www.havoc-guild.us/WWS/Magtheridon/09-09-2007/Magtheridon%20Kill/index.html" target="_blank">WWS</a>. <br>
<br>
<br>
Oh, and about Weapon Procs increasing with hastes. Maybe you haven't been paying attention to this thread since I have already had to mention this at least 3 times, but <b>hastes do not increase proc rates</b>: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071230224312/http://elitistjerks.com/f31/t15553-proc_per_minute_mechanics_haste/" target="_blank">Proc Per Minute Mechanics &amp; Haste</a>. The only exception is Combat Potency. Though having both Kill Command and Go for the Throat doing the same for hunters would appear to even things out. <br>
<br>
"I did say that haste rating is nowhere near as valuable to a hunter as it is to a rogue" is about where I stopped reading your post and just started skimming. You fail at understanding hunter mechanics if you actually believe this. Not to mention you have nothing to back it. You keep referring to the Global Cooldown as the one and only reason for a hunter not getting as much out of haste. You simply do not have a grasp on hunter mechanics and gear selections if you think this is true. <br>
<br>
What you fail to realize is that a hunter operating under haste sees a dramatic increase in total DPS. Much more than if he were to stack crit, agility, or even hit. Your point about Rogues gaining more from haste has absolutely no basis and no backing aside from a string of poorly reasoned references to game mechanics that you do not understand. <br>
<br>
The Global Cooldown is a valid point *if* the hunter stayed BM at the T6 level with a DST in the mix. If you actually took the time to analyze what happens to Hunter DPS with haste, you might realize that with a DST and enough haste, the Hunter raid spec switches from BM to MM and their total DPS increases substantially. MM is already a higher DPS spec (18/43/0) than BM - the reason it is not a raid spec is because it is terribly mana inefficient. A MM runs out of mana long before BM, and as a result has to choke back their DPS, use Aspect of the Viper, down-rank shots, and to top it off their shot rotation is horrible. The DST and haste creates a condition where a MM can switch from the standard 1:1.5 shot rotation to a 1:1 mana efficient (and more forgiving) rotation, maintaining higher over-all DPS than BM. Haste has a double effect for MM: mana efficiency, and the ability to switch to a higher DPS build. It is impossible with any set of haste gear currently in the game to get down to the Global Cooldown as MM, so there is no point where a MM has to stop stacking haste. <br>
<br>
To get all this information, all you had to do was read the thread I linked earlier analyzing the effects of Haste on Hunter builds. Not to mention everything else you attempted to cite as evidence has already been hashed out over the course of this thread. <br>
<br>
Before you post try reading the last few pages. You bring nothing new to the debate aside from flame-baiting.</div>

</div>This is a guild by guild decision. Saying "in general" doesn't quite agree with that. I believe several here have said give it the person that a.)is a good DPSer and b.)has the DKP for the item. That is all we have been saying. Limiting by class is just short-sighted. Saying "rogues do more dps then hunters in general" does nothing for the converstaion. I can show u tons of logs with BM hunters smoking rogues. I am sure there are tons of logs of rogues owning BM hunters. Thats not the point. Unless you ran some formal poll and have some numbers I am unaware of "in general" both classes can beat eachother. Both classes do great DPS. I also don't think there are as many crappy hunters out there as you guys think. Maybe just on your server *shrug*.</div>

The 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 6th highest dps kills (Yes, some feature rogues with [multiple] Fel Rages, ignore them if you want)<br>
Yes, hunters will (likely) have to move in/out to soak bloodboils, rogues have to move away from fel acid and spread out much earlier to avoid cleaves when he runs to the Fel Raged person.<br>
<br>
Basically, just click on any fight and you got a pretty high chance of seeing a rogue at the top.  The occasional one shows hunters ahead of rogues, but by-and-large you see rogues ahead.<br>
<br>
Oh, and then theres Supremus.. a fight which is HEAVILY anti-melee.  Yet I can find parses with rogues toping the meters:<br>

</div>Yea, that link has probably floated around a lot lately. I'm very proud of those numbers.<br>
Did that with 1 piece of T6 gear HoD instead of Legacy, I wasn't using my timeless arrows either. <br>
That is one of the highest dps hunter logs on Teron in the game I believe, and I will add it was an exceptionally perfect fight as far as luck goes. Quick shots and DST were rotating perfectly I kept haste up for most of the fight, but yes it does show the extreme power of the DST which is the reason it was linked in this thread.</div>

		<div id="post_message_476926">Our guild made the somewhat controversial decision to give Hunters a fair shot at the DSTs.  The first 6 ended up going to hunter/rogue/hunter/rogue/rogue/fury warrior.<br>
<br>
Our hunters do great DPS, have 100% attendance, and have been in the guild for two years so it was not reasonable for us to theorycraft them out of contention.  We recognized the arguments that the DST likely mathematically benefits the raid more on a rogue, but pragmatically the percentage difference bonus between the rogue and a hunter was not great enough for us to go down this path of drama.  <br>
<br>
Example log of a recent Teron kill with our hunters, rogues, and myself all using DST:<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071230224312/http://www.lossendil.com/wws/?report=swsktcfwtonw5&amp;s=3144-3402" target="_blank">Wow Web Stats</a><br>
Edit: I believe the hunters did even better this week with concentration aura, I'll update this post when the WWS is up. WWS: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071230224312/http://www.lossendil.com/wws/?report=ehgearloyce63&amp;s=2621-2858" target="_blank">Wow Web Stats</a> 100-150 DPS improvement with conc aura, 1900 BM hunter<br>
<br>
Do the rogues win the meters?  Yes.  Are the hunters dead weight?  Far from it.  In the end you have to ask yourself whether pissing off your hunters is worth the marginally better raid DPS.</div>

</div>This is pretty ridiculous to use as proof. Looking at this first log, all 3 Rogues have the DST and none of the Hunters do. And each one of those Hunters used a sub-optimal rotation or DPS spec (Retro is Survival). You've only proved that Rogues with a DST out-DPS Hunters without one. I don't think that's news to anyone.<br>
<br>
I have not looked through the rest of the logs provided, so there may be better evidence in there to support your claims.<br>
<br>
My opinion is that a good player gets more out of this trinket than a bad player. Rogue/Hunter toon not withstanding. This pissing contest that has erupted between the Hunters and Rogues is pointless, and belongs more <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071230224312/http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/board.html?forumId=10016&amp;sid=1" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071230224312/http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/board.html?forumId=10020&amp;sid=1" target="_blank">here</a>.<br>
<br>
Each guild is going to have to decide for itself how to deal with this trinket. As far as I know, my model for the DST is the only one out there for Hunters right now, and it makes it incredible for us. I'm sure it is incredible for Rogues as well, the logs listed clearly show impressive DPS numbers. But generalizing it for one class over the other is a waste of time, and people are starting to get a bit too emotional about it.</div>

</div>Well, if that's what you said, you're wrong. Combat Potency, rogue poisons, sword specialisation and Windfury totem all benefit from haste. You can also add any on-crit procs to that such as Hourglass of the Unraveller.<br>
<br>
Things a rogue might use that are ppm-based are: Dragonspine Totem, Thundering Skyfire Diamond, Mongoose Enchant, Romulo's Poison Vial.<br>
<br>
I have no particular view one way on the other on which class benefits most from DST, however you don't help your cause by being wrong about proc effects. Haste significantly benefits the vast majority of procs that matter to a rogue.<br>

<br>
About the WWS parses.. I just clicked on some random ones.  Did you use armory to check that the rogues had DST or haste proc counts in the log? (remember, abacus and potions also proc 'haste').  Also, add a generous 15% dps to each of those hunters - they still don't beat the rogues.  My point was merely that instead of few, rare and exceptional parses where hunters do incredible dps (a lot of skill mixed with some luck).. rogues doing well is more the "common" pattern.<br>

As has been mentioned already, rogues and hunters both benefit tremendously from this trinket.  I'm still of the opinion that the raid will see a greater boost giving it to a rogue over a hunter, but that assumes your average hunter and average rogue.  There are certainly some hunters who shine above the rogues in their guild.. congrats to them, those guilds could likely be better of having the DST in the hands of the hunter.<br>

</div>I think our hunters were still using snake trap in the WWS parses you linked. We don't do that anymore. Here's a link to a Teron kill in which they didn't have to waste time dropping that trap: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080429231611/http://www.juggernautguild.com/wws/2.1/wws-20070829-1950/index.html" target="_blank">WWS</a><br>
<br>
Crat upgraded a bunch of gear since that parse, including his bow, by the way. I seem to remember an EJ parse with hunters breaking 2k dps as well. <br>
<br>
Also, yeah, all of our rogues have DST and none of our hunters do, so you can't really use our parses to prove that DST is better for rogues. These days I think DST is probably slightly better for a rogue than it is for a hunter, but there are factors which are much more important when awarding loot anyway, unless your loot system is terrible(very possible!)<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

It provides a solid single target threat increase when chain spamming Maul.  It had an awesome uptime too, though I suppose that'd be nerfed now with the internal cooldown.<br>

</div>Except that the proc does not always instantly occur when the internal cooldown expires.<br>
<br>
Also, 1 PPM generally applies on a per weapon basis, i.e. your main hand generates approximately 1 PPM, <i>and</i> your offhand generates approximately 1 PPM, and your special attacks also generate some fractional PPM based on the frequency you perform them relative to the speed of your main hand weapon. Those things considered, the "actual" PPM is easily pushed to around or over 2. However, the base proc rate is still calculated as 1 PPM.<br>
<br>
Modeling it as given above with 1 PPM and a 20 second cooldown, I come up with 24.77% uptime for it for a sword rogue with <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30082" target="_blank">[Talon of Azshara]</a>, <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32027" target="_blank">[Merciless Gladiator's Quickblade]</a>, and Windfury.<br>
<br>
(edit) Also note that internal cooldowns on procs are considered to begin their duration when the proc occurs, not when the proc expires. Thus, a 20 second cooldown would imply that Dragonspine Trophy would have "10 up, 10 down," rather than "10 up, 20 down."<br>
<br>
(edit 2) I believe <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32505" target="_blank">[Madness of the Betrayer]</a> was calculated to also have 1 PPM with no internal cooldown. My modeling thus puts it at about 39.67% uptime, very close to the number mentioned above.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
The implies a horrible chance of proc. Effectively, if the thing is up 25% of the time and the effect lasts for 10 secs... If you are saying that the "cooldown" starts with the proc itself, then it has what I'd call a 40 sec cooldown.<br>
<br>
I suppose if someone proved that it procs as soon as 10 sec after the last one ended, then we know indeed its 20 secs. I'm just stunned to learn the next proc is so extraorindary unlikely that the trinket is only up 10 secs out of 40 and yet it could be up 10 secs out of 20.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_499783"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Well, I guess the post on page 15 of the thread "answers" my question, tho I confess its entirely not intituitve. If the average "start till to proc" was 14 seconds before, they surely implies a lot more than 1 proc per minute. In fact, it implies something dramatically higher.<br>
<br>
If the proc per minute is down to 1, the cooldown is irrelevant at 20 seconds, it's that the cooldown destroys the proc rate. Only if the thing procs in the last 1/3 of the minute would it even matter. And then, still, on average you are getting your next minute's proc within your next minute. <br>
<br>
I don't see how the proc before 2.2 wasn't ~3 ppm.<br>
<br>
And if that's the case this was "triple nerfed""<br>
<br>
(1) Haste change overall<br>
(2) Proc per minute cut from 3+ to 1<br>
(3) Internal CD added<br>
<br>
Effectively (3) is irrelevant it's that (3) creates (2). Before you'd have slightly better than up 10, down 10 (according to the post I just reread). If ppm is really 1, then you'd have up 10, down 50 on balance anyway. (Yes, I get the 10 seeconds up can fall anywhere within the minute). The cooldown is enforcing a cycle time on the proc that didn't exist....<br>
<br>
I was going to understand how this went from 55% uptime to 25% uptime based on an alleged 20sec internal cooldown, but I can't make the math work, so perhaps someone will.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
Let's make some extreme simplifications to attempt to explain how it works. Assume it had an average of 20 sec between procs before, giving 50% uptime, with 20 sec cd it will have an average of 40 sec between procs, giving 25% uptime. How can this be so hard to grasp? And how is it not intuitive?<br>

		<div id="post_message_500339"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Dragonspine Trophy has a 20 sec hidden cooldown, and is 1 PPM.  In a raid environment, it typically takes about 20 seconds once it comes off cooldown to re-proc; hence procs are spaced by about 40 seconds, yielding the noted 25% uptime.<br>
<br>
Madness of the Betrayer is a 1 PPM effect.  It therefore runs 40-50% uptime.<br>
<br>
Based off this information and the Rogue Gear Spreadsheet, we draw the following conclusions:<br>
<br>
For a rogue, Dragonspine is still the best trinket in the game.<br>
<br>
At late T5/early T6 type itemization, Warp Spring Coil is the 2nd best trinket for a rogue; however, as one moves into late T6 itemization, Madness and Ashtongue Talisman compete for the #2 slot; I believe Ashtongue to be slightly ahead for most rogues.<br>
<br>
I can't comment for other classes, but given that other classes can't use either Ashtongue or WSC, it seems likely to me that Dragonspine Trophy/Madness of the Betrayer is the optimal combo for them.<br>
<br>
However, it should be noted that a warrior will typically contribute more DPS to the raid by using Solarian's Sapphire over Madness of the Betrayer, assuming said warrior is placed in a group with at least 2 other melee DPSers (which, in my experience, is fairly common)<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
If the thing used to be up 55% of the time, it proced -- for the player -- 3x per minute. While it's fine to theorycraft how many procs per minute per type of attack (OH, MH, specials) that yields, unless I'm mistaken, the proc affects your white attacks regardless (both hands, hunters auto-shot, whatever).<br>
<br>
So back on earth, before out of every 20ish seconds, it was up for 10 of them. In other words, 3x per minute you got a proc and you were hasted.<br>
<br>
Now, apparently, the uptime is 25%. So for every 40ish seconds, it's up for 10 of them. This is 1.5 procs per minute -- for the player. <br>
<br>
You were hasted for &gt;30 secs per minute, you are hasted for 15 seconds per minute. What type of swing or special generated that haste is interesting when you are trying to understand the finer adjustment of how something like windfury affects (or doesn't if it turned out to be irrelevant0 the uptime.<br>
<br>
That said, the only thing actually interesting to the player is the # of seconds per minute that it's working and / or the %age uptime, which are really one and the same.<br>
<br>
What confused me was that, well, the mechanics are kind of convoluted once you get the answer. And you could've largely gotten the answer without every understanding the mechanics.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_598794"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Napkin math on estimated item budgets (DST vs MOTB):<br>
<br>
<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28830" target="_blank">[Dragonspine Trophy]</a><br>
40 ap passive<br>
81 haste (325 * 25% appx uptime with 1.5ppm)<br>
<br>
<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32505" target="_blank">[Madness of the Betrayer]</a><br>
88 ap passive (+44 over dragonspine)<br>
20 hit passive (+20 over dragonspine)<br>
120 armor penetration (300 * 40% appx uptime)<br>
<br>
Now the extra hit, ap and armor penetration are nice, however, look at the total amount of "budget" on each item with these approximations:<br>
<br>
Assuming 1 stat budget point = 2 ap = 1 haste rating = 1 hit rating = 7 armor penetration<br>
<br>
Appx budget for DST: 20+81= <b>101</b><br>
Appx budget for MOTB: 44+20+17= <b>81</b><br>
<br>
Although hit is the best stat for rogues to stack up to cap, other stats are close to as good overall, and in terms of total stats MOTB is behind significantly (~20%) compared to DST. I think blizzard needs to make the 300 armor penetration passive rather than a proc, then MOTB would basically be tied with DST instead of inferior in terms of budget. Either that or nerf DST again.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>It is probably one of the many fail safe tricks to keep old content from not being skipped entirely, with the arrival of high level gear for most other slots.<br>
<br>
And to be honest, people farmed Onyxia for ages for a bag.<br>
Plus, Blizz did the same with BWL, when people still cleared it for trinkets even when having Kel on farm. Heck, <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=19379" target="_blank">[Neltharion's Tear]</a> and <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=19406" target="_blank">[Drake Fang Talisman]</a> are still viable options to this day in some cases.<br>
<br>
And last but not least, it was nerfed, twice even. Firstly, the haste effect from haste rating was reduced, and then the DST got an internal 20 sec cooldown, if I'm not mistaken.<br>
<br>
EDIT: beaten to it, and I got the nerf wrong, too :/<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>There are two trinket slots, I realize that. Like Enova said, its usually a good idea to have a passive and active as opposed to two passive.<br>

I didnt say that DST was horrible for hunters, just that Warrior/Rogue/Shaman will probably NOT replace it while hunters will have a higher chance to replace it. The discussion was about what classes it is THE BEST IN THE GAME for, not who its good for.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Actually, if the +10-20% tps increase in bear was confirmed (I do not believe it has been) I think a good argument could be made that bears should get it first if you play the "what benefits guilds the most" game. Beyond the situational MT usage where you need the extra threat and can afford to lose some mitigation/survivability by swapping out whatever trinket is opposite the badge of tenacity (the options are good but not spectacular)...it would be incredible for offtanking fights where the druid shifts between bear and cat (huge aggro boost in bear, best dps trinket in cat).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Some fights are threat capped. Some fights need for OTs to build threat quickly. Rogue in my guild says that if I did +15% more threat he could forgo salvation (faster farming ftw). In certain situations a +15% threat would allow for a similar increase in dps from the entire raid. ( &gt; +50dps from a single rogue). Again, situational but very powerful if true but...<br>

</div>Why would they?<br>
<br>
In fact, given that your other major threat gen abilities are on the GCD and unaffected by the DST haste proc, an average of 5% melee haste would result in a less than 5% increase in TPS.<br>
<br>
For someone to claim 10-20%, they must be:<br>
<br>
- talking about the uptime period for the haste proc, rather than the average of both uptime and downtime together;<br>
- dealing with a very specific cirumstance in which you are highly rage-starved, to the point where you can't use your threat abilities every GCD and thus more white attacks will give you a significant increase in available rage/threat; or<br>
- wrong.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Any fight with multiple threat resets would allow DPS to go all out faster. Fury warriors, Enhance Shammies, Ret PLDs, warlocks... Any high DPS class with no reset button on their aggro would benefit from a tank having more threat. In my TPS set (nearly maxed Expertise, high hit and crit), I still can have problems versus Full T6 DPS classes when they can go all out. Druid threat is high, but like PLD/Warrior, it can't keep up with Glaive equiped classes and crazy crazy warlocks.<br>
<br>
I find the Feral DST argument amusing everytime an uninformed poster makes it. To me, it seems that everyone that claims Feral should pass on it is the loot hungry one, looking for less competition. DST is the best in slot DPS trinket for nearly every physical DPS class in the game. End of story. Unless you are a cookie cutter, cutting edge progression guild, give the trinket to whoever has earned it.<br>
<br>
Feral white DPS typically ranges between 30-40% white. However, the use of Haste increases 2pc T4, which every Feral druid uses until 4pc T6, and even then its a toss up. In 2.4, Druids will combine the two set bonuses. The only gear set up that beats 2pc T4 in Sunwell is literally having the best DPS leather pieces (the rogue ones) in every slot. Even then, its a tiny upgrade.<br>
<br>
I hope that clears up some misinformation for you.<br>

</div>No, the guild is benefited by rewarding good players with the gear they have earned. Following the "who gets the most/best use of an item" logic is a quick way to make raid members feel trivialized because they are given loot not on their attitude, skill and attendance, but what class they decided to roll two years ago. Class discrimination creates drama, drama causes raids to crash.<br>
<br>
As Ferals are pretty much the only class expected to play two roles within a raid, they would never be given gear based on the fact they are playing their class well. "You only tank 50% of the time, loot goes to Warrior/PLD!". "You only DPS half the time, loot goes to Rogue!". See the problem? I am not suggesting that Ferals are given twice the loot, but ignoring the fact that they are expected to DPS when not tanking breeds the ignorant opinions that Ferals cannot DPS end game. Fact of the matter is I never received a DPS upgrade for all T4/T5 content, so it was hardly a suprise when my DPS started to lack. Now that I am in a fairly decent DPS set, I can get some respectable placements on the meters.<br>
<br>
If I tally up all my DPS and tank loot I received in T6, I still dont match the "pure" classes, because Blizzard neglected to give Feral Druids more than 1 offset piece per entire Tier (thanks for the boot upgrade in T4/5/6!). Most Druid ares in the same boat. Think on that before denying a class an item.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_685009"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->6000 AP is possible, if you average out AP procs, buffed out in an feral/enh/war/2xRogue group.    Include adamantite weightstones, as they'll work for druids next patch. <br>
<br>
Some points on the scaling of haste rating for feral druids: <br>
<br>
Simply, very few stats actually scale well for feral druids.  Agility is far and away the best.  Since only one trinket has on-use agility (and it's primarily an armor trinket), we don't get our ideal stat on trinkets.  Agility tends to be 30-50% better point-for-point than most other stats. Armor penetration is also slightly better than other stats.   All the other stats are fairly bunched together-- especially at endgame, you can call haste, hit, crit, AP, and Strength have at most a 20% spread between all of them at endgame.  A haste proc is more or less as good as an AP proc, equally itemized.  <br>
<br>
Since DST is still "overitemized" even compared to T6 trinkets, it is the best trinket out there for feral druids.<br>
<br>
The most important factors for giving it to a feral is the percentage of time the feral will use it, and the DPS upgrade it will give them.  If you prioritize DPS trinkets to classes that they're best for, ferals will be waiting a LONG time to get them.  If they're using a <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32654" target="_blank">[Crystalforged Trinket]</a> because TTs and MotBs have also been going to DPS classes, CfT-&gt;DST for the feral could be a larger upgrade to raid DPS than MotB-&gt;DST or WSC-&gt;DST for a rogue if the feral DPSes often enough.  The ferals don't get DPS trinkets just for being their class like rogues do, either.  <br>
<br>
So-- 20 DPS for a (3rd or 4th tank) feral who DPSes 75% of the time or 10 DPS for a rogue that DPSes 100% of the time?  If you've always been prioritizing DPS trinkets to "pure DPS" classes, this case might come up, and it becomes optimal to upgrade the feral.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_685444"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I'm actually often persuaded by Allev's argument. It's kinda foolish to put such a vauable item in the hands of a class where it's "less optimal" as a general rule. That said, if said class has been has been kept down by "the man" enough times, eventually his day comes. It's just worth considering what your guild actually does in your raids. And making your own decisions accordingly. Our ferals dps some. In our case, it'd be somewhat ridiculous for them to pick up the Dragonspine over, say, myself still sporting a Romulo's, never haven gotten a WSC, etc. etc. In another guild, YMMV.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_685490"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->First off, I have to echo the sentiment that when measuring a "min-max" scenario for distribution of this trinket, that you have to look at replacement value coupled with attendance.  Obviously, if a rogue already has Madness (and has Ashtongue exalted, or nearing it), the replacement value compared to a druid with Hourglass just does not compute.  I hate the argument that "its wasted", when a 20 dps upgrade is the same no matter what class is wielding it.  With that said, I'm a feral druid with a DST (only got it last week).  I am also the guildmaster of my guild... before anyone crys holy hell, hear me out.<br>
<br>
I don't mean this as anything but a suggestion, but what I've done for my guild is that I've encouraged people to form "PUG Gruuls" in order to farm this trinket, with intent that the trinket is reserved for guild members only.<br>
<br>
While we've been killing Illidan since October, it's clear that this trinket is better than anything available in BT for every physical dps class I can think of.  Even the class that benefits the least, Feral Druids (with 40-45% dps as white dmg) finds this as the #1 dps trinket by far in raid buffed situations.   It would be silly to not continue to farm gruul, but the fact is, if your entire guild gets saved to 1 gruul, you have exactly 1 chance at the trinket per week (with a drop rate of 20%).  Currently, my guild has something like 12 reliable physical dps, of which only 3 had this trinket before a couple months ago.  If I want to equip my guild with as many DSTs as possible, would it not make sense to try to separate us into 4 different gruul groups to get 4 chances at it? <br>
<br>
Now what I've found is that you don't need 25 people in T6 to kill gruul.  In fact, you don't need any.  You don't even need to be fully epic'd to kill Gruul in this fashion.  I've found that plenty of "half blue/epic" players are willing to come to gruuls if only for a chance at the T4, not to mention things like the caster sword or the warrior shield. <br>
<br>
B/c of this, my guild has been running "PUG Gruuls" for the past 2 months now.  We usually have 3-4 guildies in each one, and maybe another 1-2 alts.  We then fill the rest of the raid with Karazhan level pugs, who with good leadership, can destroy Maulgar and Gruul.  The only challenge you sometimes need to overcome is finding a capable Mage tank.  But having 2 of your main mages in your guild perform this can handle it for 2 groups at the minimum.<br>
<br>
Of course, Blackrock is a high population server, so this might be more difficult for people on less populated servers.  But nevertheless, since we've started encouraging the 4-pug-gruul marathon, our guild has netted 4 more DSTs in 2 months.<br>
<br>
(In preparation for each of the pugs I run however, I do spend about 20 min gathering 25 sorcerer and beast flasks.. its not free, but its a relatively cheap price to pay for such an awesome trinket.  If you think about how difficult it is to claw up the DKP for a Madness of the Betrayer, compared with the relative ease of organizing a 45 min pug gruul run, pug gruul wins... my motto for the guild is basically, every physical dps should have one, since its so easy to get)<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Furthermore, assuming you run with at least 3 paladins what exactly is your rogue going to gain by not having salv? Light? Honestly, a feral druid taking this trinket from a "dps" class is just loot-hungriness.

<br>
On average Catform normal melee damage is 40-45% of overall damage, not to mention the T4 bonus gain potential  from faster attacks when DST procs.<br>
<br>
I have to agree with the previous post - if your Rogue already has Madness and Ashtongue trinket, then giving DST to the Druid stuck with Hourglass or similar (as many including myself are) would potentially benefit the raid more on boss encounters where they are in a dps role. Honestly, how long do you expect your Ferals to "pass" items? Until WotlK?<br>
<br>
I've passed DST and TT to our dps classes so far despite being able to out-bid them usually but it's a decision based on what they currently use - not any perceived "greater benefit" in absolute terms.<br>

		<div id="post_message_467467" class="post_message_underline">SSC and TK fights are, in general, more caster friendly than melee friendly, especially if you use certain tactics. All the AoE fights (i.e. Hydross dependant on strategy, Morogrim, Solarian) automatically bias themselves towards mages and warlocks. Karathress has a number of short range nuke/stun effects. Leotheras has Whirlwind which disadvantages melee a lot more than casters. Lurker has a significant drawback for melee (threat cap, especially on adds). Al'ar just screws over melee in p1. Kael phase 1 is 50% melee unfriendly to the point of sitting over in a corner afk. Vashj is generally melee unfriendly too (roots, p2, static charge). <br>
<br>
SSC and TK are clearly both biased directly away from melee, and yet (in general) melee hold their own. Once you move out of SSC/TK the fights start to become very melee friendly, or caster unfriendly (first 3 in Hyjal, Teron, Gurtogg (no moving in/out in general), RoS (zero armour), Shahraz (hi casters)). The effect of gaining haste gear and moving from melee unfriendly/caster friendly into zones where the fights are melee friendly/caster unfriendly is quite phenomenal. The raid game seems to have been balanced at the point where people leave SSC/TK, as at that point our melee were starting to slightly edge ahead, even on the melee unfriendly/caster friendly fights. If you're smart in where you position yourself to maximise DPS time and use bloodlust at the right point, you can do extremely well with the melee synergy that is in the game. <br>
<br>
This is why you get what you call "Exponential scaling" while the rest of us are arguing that it's not exactly clear cut. The fight mechanics make it very hard to tell just what is going on, apart from rogues being obviously at the wrong point in T6 content.<br>
<br>
<br>
When you get to the T6 level and see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120809212939/http://www.lossendil.com/wws/?report=2ichpb2upqn4q&amp;s=2503-2738" target="_blank">rogues doing 50% more damage than anyone else in the raid</a>, it's pretty clear the balance is out of whack. From my experience and WWS parses I've seen, it's mostly rogues who are over the line. Everyone else is pretty well balanced, with the exception of particular fights for particular specs, which is just a "strength vs weakness" argument rather than things being amazingly out of balance (arcane mages on RoS as an example).</div>

</div>As I've posted before, I don't mind if Blizzard fixes the scaling being better than linear. I don't mind if they nerf the two haste items that are most overpowered, the DST and the swords from Illidan.<br>
<br>
But since 2.1 they have nerfed sword spec (yellow-&gt;white, no procs of procs), windfury, flat haste nerf. Now they are introducing hidden internal cooldowns on many items. But if they indeed are adjusting procrate on the fly regarding current weapon speed, that gets really beyond what I can accept. It goes against everything rogues have done over the last 2.5 years. Every rogue knows to keep slice&amp;dice up. Stacking haste was a nice strategy if you knew something about your class. I know many rogues (with better gear than me), who always follow these rules: "BT loot &gt; Hiyal loot &gt; TK loot &gt; SSC loot &gt; Karazhan loot &gt; any blue loot". They don't think, they don't compare, they just take the loot dropping from the hardest boss.<br>
<br>
I always liked it that you could compensate lack of gear a little bit by picking the right gear. All these nerfs basically make it so that the simplistic rogues are right when they say "BT &gt; Hiyal &gt; etc".<br>
<br>
How does the haste nerf affect me ?<br>
<br>
There is another thread about pvp weapons. And how hard it is to get a good pve mainhand weapon.<br>
<br>
I was at over 25 Garr kills. Saw one Brutality blade drop, and was very lucky to get it.<br>
I was at over 25 Onyxia kills. Never saw a Vis'Kag drop.<br>
I was at 10 Chromaggus kills. Never saw a CTS drop.<br>
I was at 10 Fankriss kills. Never saw a AQR drop.<br>
There is was, at the first bosses in Naxx, with my mighty Brutality Blade.<br>
After I left the game, my guild split up. 2 guilds, both killing Chrom and Fankriss for 3 months. Combined they got one AQR and no CTS.<br>
<br>
I have a Vindicator's Brand. Got it the day I hit level 70. I killed Netherspite a few times, and never saw a Spiteblade. My guild doesn't do Kazzak.<br>
<br>
I have learned from this. I don't expect to get a decent mainhand sword ever in this game. I'm not gonna wait for Morogrim to drop me a sword. Besides, it will take a while till we get there. And I'm not the only rogue.<br>
<br>
I'm not gonna wait for it. I had decided to go blacksmithing and make a Dragonmaw/Dragonstrike. Those are good maces, and the haste proc balances the drawbacks that those maces have no others stats, and that mace spec is sub-par compared to sword spec.<br>
<br>
I have done 4 weeks of arena games. I'll pick up my offhand sword on wednesday. I really dislike pvp. I refuse to act as content for other players. I am not gonna go through 8 more weeks of shitty pvp for the mainhand sword. If I have to do that, I rather go play another game. (BioShock is waiting).<br>
<br>
Well, it turns out my reply turned into a whine-reply. Bye bye cruel world, I'm probably gonna get banned now.<br>
<br>
But for me, these haste nerfs, and proc-rate nerfs all come together with the choice of my mainhand weapon. Now that we can expect Dragonstrike/Dragonmaw to be on par with my Vindicator's Brand, I'll be doomed to keep using my Vindicator's for a few more months. Like I have done since I hit level70. I guess I'll have to follow the same strategy as every other rogue: spend your dkp on T5 gear, and get pvp swords.<br>
<br>
I feel more pushed into a "middle of the road" position in a game, then I feel that pressure in real life.</div>

</div>I'm sorry, my mistake. I didn't mean exponential (O(2^n)) but polynomial (O(n^2)).<br>
<br>
The way it used to work, rogues scaled better than O(n). And you should realize that exponential does not only mean O(n^2). Even O(n^1.001) is polynomial.<br>
<br>
There is a ceiling to proc-based haste rating. And that is when you have so much haste that all your haste items are proccing constantly, giving you a 100% uptime of all your haste-effects. Then the scaling goes back to a flat line. Someone called this a "S-curve" before. However, we haven't reached that yet. So for me, and my limited mathematical lingo, scaling beyond linear is called polynomial. Maybe there is a better term ?<br>

</div>Yes, I've read that only  a few days ago. And this is another noticeable nerf. All nerfs together give rogues a substantial reduction in their dps. Which was maybe necessary at T6 levels. But I don't see the need to nerf rogues at T4 level. (Except nerfing the DST itself).<br>

</div>The scaling graph of rogues is curved. When you compare it to the graph of other classes. And probably also when you compare it to the graph of dps required to defeat harder bosses. That makes it beyond linear. Polynomial is the only word I know to describe it.<br>
<br>
Introducing internal cooldowns reduces the polynomial effect. The reduced proc-chances under haste reduces the polynomial effect too. A flat haste nerf does not. I don't understand why they had to do the flat haste nerf, when the other two, in combination with a DST/glaives nerf would have fixed the problem. They are just throwing all possible solutions at the problem, and doing huge overkill.</div>

</div>What you have stated, has NOTHING to do haste nerfs. It is just a whine about how badly the dice roll has screwed you over in terms of PvE weapon, which I can relate to, but does not help your argument.<br>
<br>
At your current standing in progression, there are 2 items that actually affect you, which are Dragonspine Trophy and the Dragonstrike Mace chain. Before 2.2 nerf, Dragonspine Trophy beats every trinket in the game, by a gigantic margin. Dragonmaw (the middle tier mace) was better than EVERY weapon in black temple, save for The Twin Blades. Do you really think it is justified that a Tier 2 Black smith weapon, with item level lower than Prince Malchezzar's drop table, should be more powerful than every other epic weapon in the game? Even as it stands right now on test server, Dragonstrike is STILL fine in terms of its place on loot progression: You can use it all the way through at least Kael'thas and Vashj. For Dragonspine Trophy, it is STILL the best trinket in the game, just not by huge margins anymore.<br>
<br>
If you have further reasonings and evidences to back yourself up, feel free to. But so far what I have seen are whinings backed up by no evidence even from other threads. I do feel that they have gone a bit much with haste nerfs, but not by such a large margin that you have shown, especially when you don't even have access to most haste gear yet.</div>

Counterpoint:  Haste is still a fine stat.  The problem is that the haste items from BT/Hyjal are horribly itemized.  Put haste on an item with sockets and a mix of haste/AP/+hit for example, and suddenly you have a good item.  Almost all the +haste items that are now inferior are socketless items that barely spread their budget around.  That's the problem.  The fact that those items used to be the best in the game despite being horribly designed is because melee haste was too good -- it was strictly than any other possible use of budget, point for point, which makes no sense.  There should be tradeoffs involved.  Redesign the haste items, with haste at 15.75, and they can still be just fine.<br>
<br>
And of course DST was too good.  Everyone knew it was too good.</div>

</div>They weren't horribly designed prior to the haste nerf.  The items were providing similar dps as other non-haste itemized gear in the same slots from the same instance.  Now they are providing similar dps to non-haste itemized items from lesser instances.<br>

</div>I agree with Gurg, they were terribly designed, based upon a single stat that was only so powerful because of the stacking effects of it with other attack-speed increase effects (Slice and dice, flurry, blade flurry, procs).<br>
<br>
There are still some examples of the haste itemization that are strong pieces. Dragonspine is, obviously, one example even with the newly surfacing internal cooldown.<br>
<br>
I also would not complain at all were someone to give me a pair of the swiftstrike bracers, because it's still probably a flat 3% (2% white, maybe 1% yellow) DPS upgrade from the haste alone, whereas with hit or crit socketed into Deadly Cuffs or Insidious Bands, you'd only wind up with about 1.25% white-DPS increase, and a marginal yellow DPS increase from increased combat potency procs.<br>
<br>
Shadow-walker's Cord, Grips of Damnation and Swiftstrike shoulders? Yeah, those are now relatively useless compared to comparable items, but Haste has not, in and of become a useful stat, and I'm sure that if it weren't for the min/maxiness of the haste items (ie. no hit, no crit, little AP, little agi, boatloads of stam), we would be kinda annoyed  by this, but not so much as seems to be the case with the present situation.</div>

</div>My understanding of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120809212939/http://thottbot.com/s32182" target="_blank">Heroism</a> is that it is percentage based, so it should not see any change at all from the haste rating nerf. It was 30% before and will remain 30%. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120809212939/http://elitistjerks.com/f40/t10343-mongoose_enchant/" target="_blank">Mongoose</a> has an incredibly small haste boost when it procs, and is also percentage based as far as any testing I have seen shows (2%).

In any event, recent testing has shown that the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120809212939/http://elitistjerks.com/f31/t15553-proc_per_minute_mechanics_haste/" target="_blank">PPM mechanic</a> is actually unaffected by hastes, so you should see no net change in the amount your abilities proc. If you are worried about seeing fewer white attacks for Seal of Blood, the DST is shown to currently have a 40% uptime with 30.95% haste for a total increase of white attacks by 12.38%. With the nerf dropping it to 25% uptime and 20.7% haste, you would see an increase in white attacks of 5.175%. Roughly 40% of it's original power. If you have the Dragonspine Trophy, yes it will certainly be a nerf and it may no longer be the best trinket in the game for Ret (I will leave that analysis to the Paladin theorycrafters); however the rest of your DPS (and any subsequent procs) should be completely unaffected.</div>

		<div id="post_message_500339" class="post_message_underline">Dragonspine Trophy has a 20 sec hidden cooldown, and is 1 PPM.  In a raid environment, it typically takes about 20 seconds once it comes off cooldown to re-proc; hence procs are spaced by about 40 seconds, yielding the noted 25% uptime.<br>
<br>
Madness of the Betrayer is a 1 PPM effect.  It therefore runs 40-50% uptime.<br>
<br>
Based off this information and the Rogue Gear Spreadsheet, we draw the following conclusions:<br>
<br>
For a rogue, Dragonspine is still the best trinket in the game.<br>
<br>
At late T5/early T6 type itemization, Warp Spring Coil is the 2nd best trinket for a rogue; however, as one moves into late T6 itemization, Madness and Ashtongue Talisman compete for the #2 slot; I believe Ashtongue to be slightly ahead for most rogues.<br>
<br>
I can't comment for other classes, but given that other classes can't use either Ashtongue or WSC, it seems likely to me that Dragonspine Trophy/Madness of the Betrayer is the optimal combo for them.<br>
<br>
However, it should be noted that a warrior will typically contribute more DPS to the raid by using Solarian's Sapphire over Madness of the Betrayer, assuming said warrior is placed in a group with at least 2 other melee DPSers (which, in my experience, is fairly common)</div>

<br>
If the thing used to be up 55% of the time, it proced -- for the player -- 3x per minute. While it's fine to theorycraft how many procs per minute per type of attack (OH, MH, specials) that yields, unless I'm mistaken, the proc affects your white attacks regardless (both hands, hunters auto-shot, whatever).<br>
<br>
So back on earth, before out of every 20ish seconds, it was up for 10 of them. In other words, 3x per minute you got a proc and you were hasted.<br>
<br>
Now, apparently, the uptime is 25%. So for every 40ish seconds, it's up for 10 of them. This is 1.5 procs per minute -- for the player. <br>
<br>
You were hasted for &gt;30 secs per minute, you are hasted for 15 seconds per minute. What type of swing or special generated that haste is interesting when you are trying to understand the finer adjustment of how something like windfury affects (or doesn't if it turned out to be irrelevant0 the uptime.<br>
<br>
That said, the only thing actually interesting to the player is the # of seconds per minute that it's working and / or the %age uptime, which are really one and the same.<br>
<br>
What confused me was that, well, the mechanics are kind of convoluted once you get the answer. And you could've largely gotten the answer without every understanding the mechanics.</div>

Now the extra hit, ap and armor penetration are nice, however, look at the total amount of "budget" on each item with these approximations:<br>

I think blizzard needs to make the 300 armor penetration passive rather than a proc, then MOTB would basically be tied with DST instead of inferior in terms of budget. Either that or nerf DST again.</div>

		<div id="post_message_649308" class="post_message_underline">According to Bellator's dps spreadsheet in the Retribution DPS Theorycrafting post in the Class Mechanics forum, the DST is indeed the best trinket for a Ret Paladin currently in the game.<br>
<br>
Link to the DPS thread: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120810132914/http://elitistjerks.com/f31/t17193-paladin_retribution_dps_theorycraft/" target="_blank">http://elitistjerks.com/f31/t17193-p...s_theorycraft/</a><br>
<br>
Based on my personal Retribution set (currently Protection specced for Hyjal) the DST is the single largest dps gain from any item, other than moving from Jin'rokh to Torch of the Damned. My guild is just starting T6 content.</div>

</div>If I recall correctly, it has already undergone 2 nerfs.  The buff used to not have an internal CD and could refresh itself, and that got nerfed to a 45sec internal CD.  Then melee haste overall took a nerf.</div>

</div>It is probably one of the many fail safe tricks to keep old content from not being skipped entirely, with the arrival of high level gear for most other slots.<br>
<br>
And to be honest, people farmed Onyxia for ages for a bag.<br>
Plus, Blizz did the same with BWL, when people still cleared it for trinkets even when having Kel on farm. Heck, <a id="itemlink" class="q4" style=" font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=19379" target="_blank">[Neltharion's Tear]</a> and <a id="itemlink" class="q4" style=" font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=19406" target="_blank">[Drake Fang Talisman]</a> are still viable options to this day in some cases.<br>
<br>
And last but not least, it was nerfed, twice even. Firstly, the haste effect from haste rating was reduced, and then the DST got an internal 20 sec cooldown, if I'm not mistaken.<br>
<br>
EDIT: beaten to it, and I got the nerf wrong, too :/</div>
