		<div id="post_message_284345"><!-- google_ad_section_start --><u><b>Step 1: Enter your gear</b></u><br>
On the 'Gear' tab you can select for every item/enchant/gem your character currently has. If you find you have an item that is not currently listed, you can enter stats for it in the 'Custom Gear' tab, and then select "Custom" for that slot. The spreadsheet automatically checks for valid gem combinations for socket bonuses and meta gem requirements.<br>
 <br>
It is also possible to import gear from the armory. This is still fresh, and might have some bugs. It currently does not include enchants.<br>
 <br>
There are 5 profiles available to use. You can select a profile name, and either save the current gear set up to it, or load in a saved profile. The profiles contain gear, talents, pet specifications, and shot rotations. You can change the name of your profiles on the 'Settings and Results' tab. The buttons marked "Save" and "Load" do just that.<br>
 <br>
The "CalcAttributes" button is used to refigure the DPS increase of each specific stat. This happens automatically as gear is changed, but not when talents, shots, or pet information changes, or a new profile is loaded. Clicking the button will recompute the results shown on the 'Settings and Results' tab.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
<u><b>Step 2: Enter your talent spec</b></u><br>
On the 'Talents' tab you can enter your current talents. Anything with a red background means it has no effect on any of the spreadsheet's calculations. These can be filled in purely to track the information for you. There is no enforcement of total talent points or their distribution. A "Reset" button is provided to clear all talents back to 0.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
<u><b>Step 3: Enter Shot Rotations</b></u><br>
This is the most complicated part of using the spreadsheet, but done in a systematic manner isn't too hard to deal with. There are 4 Shot Rotations that can be specified. They are as follows:<ul><li>Normal haste. This one is found on the 'Shot Rotations' tab, and bases timing off of the static haste and weapon speed your character has. On this sheet you can also specify your latency (or reaction time if you hand-time shots) and what Aspect you want to be in. There are buttons provided to assist in building standard rotations <i>(please note that these do currently not work for Open Office users)</i>:<ul><li>Reset - clear all shots to None. This is best used when building your own shot rotation from scratch.</li>
<li>AutoOnly - sets every shot to Auto Shot.</li>
<li>1:1 (Steady) - A standard Auto, Steady repeat rotation.</li>
<li>1:1 (Priority) - A standard 1:1 rotation where you can assign different specials to be prioritized if they are off cooldown.</li>
<li>1:1.X - This allows you to quickly build a shot rotation that will factor in 2 specials between autos as appropriate. You can indicate whether you want Arcane, Multi, or both included. If both are selected it picks the highest damaging shot if both are available at the same time.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Quick Shots. This is located on the 'Quick Shots' tab. In all respects it is identical to what you find on the normal 'Shot Rotation' tab. Latency and Aspect are used based on the values set on the 'Shot Rotation' tab. (If you do not use Aspect of the Hawk, or have no points in Improved Aspect of the Hawk this entire rotation doesn't matter.)</li>
<li>Dragonspine Trophy. There are 2 rotations available on the 'Dragonspine Trophy' tab. One is for the DST proc without Quick Shots active, and the other is for both Quick Shots and DST proc active simultaneously. The Dragonspine Trophy's effect is modeled by determining your time spent in different haste states, and the damage you do while they are active. If you do not have a Dragonspine Trophy equipped you can ignore this tab.</li>
</ul><u><b>Step 4: Enter Pet data</b></u><br>
The 'Pet' tab allows you to pick your pet's type (Cat, Ravager, etc.) and assign training points to all possible abilities. You get warnings if you pick abilities not applicable to your pet, or if you exceed the total number of training points available. You can also select a mood and loyalty level for your pet.<br>
 <br>
There is a "pet bar" feature where you can prioritize your pet's abilities based on how you want them to consume focus. It displays average cast times for each ability based on available focus, the ability cooldown, and the pet's global cooldown (1.5s). This is a handy way to see if Bite + Claw is better than Claw or compare other abilities head to head. <br>
 <br>
 <br>
<u><b>Step 5: Check results</b></u><br>
The 'Settings and Results' tab provides summaries of a bunch of different information. Most of it should be self-explanatory. There is also a DPS equivalency matrix comparing different statistics. This is useful in determining which next item will provide the most "bang for the buck."<br>
 <br>
As you modify any value in the spreadsheet the results will update automatically. You also can see summary information from your saved profiles. Clicking in the profile name box allows you to rename it. There are also control setting to average out some talents, and to control the Dragonspine Trophy mechanics.<br>
 <br>
The "Export" button creates a file in your "My Documents" directory called CheekyHunterDPS.log that contains the data of all 5 of your profiles. The "Import" button loads this file into the spreadsheet. You will still need to use the "Load" button on the 'Gear' tab to bring the profile data into the active set of gear, talents, pet, and shot rotations. These files will be supported in future spreadsheet versions.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

- Provide for three Buff Profiles. These are Loaded/Saved on the 'Buffs' tab, the names are controlled on 'Settings and Results' and they are Imported/Exported properly.<br>
- Users can select from 3 types of shot rotations - Hand-Weaving, Castsequence, and Spam. These refer to the common methods of timing by hand, or using some of the various macros available.<br>
- Using Castsequence macros results in latency being added to the start of every shot cast to account for server&lt;-&gt;client communication.<br>
- Using either Hand-Weaving or Spam macros results in latency being a factor when computing GCD based on whether or not the previous shot was an Auto Shot. This means the Shot Rotation matrix will now try and mimic the behavior seen of the GCD being client-only.<br>
- Added a button to build the Auto, Steady, Steady, Auto, Steady (usually referred to as "3:2") shot rotation automatically.<br>

		<div id="post_message_284406"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->* Moved this from other thread when I saw spreadsheets were branching off *<br>
<br>
My spreadsheet I linked earlier in this thread (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080330030620/http://www.havoc-guild.us/Cheeky/Hunter_DPS_Calc.xls" target="_blank">Worksheet</a>) allows for each person to set up their own shot cycle, so it can be tailored to their weapon speed.<br>
<br>
In my latest version most of the Survival talents have been modeled. Yep, they still seem very underwhelming, but they are there.<br>
<br>
Still missing a lot of base statistics for different race/level combinations, and the crit/hit/agility ratios for levels 68 &amp; 69 (I'm level 67, everything up to then seems accurate.)<br>
<br>
If you have some free time, please take a look at this and let me know if you find it useful. It's mostly done just as I have discovered things that would be useful to me, but I wouldn't mind adding features for other people too. If you find any gear, enchants, or gems I'm missing please let me know to, and I'll get them added.<br>
<br>
I've been told it's pretty confusing. There are instructions on the first tab for what the other tabs are used for. Also all gear is set up for what my character is currently wearing, so change out what you need.<br>

</div>To be honest, I'm not 100% sure. I'm calculating them using the (1 - (chance of not)^(number attempts)) math and then averaging their results over that. I use the shot rotation page to compute the number of shots/second the Hunter is doing for their rotation.<br>
<br>
I know it's not going to be as exact as a simulator (mostly because mine assumes a steady state, so even your first shot is getting some benefit) but it should be a close enough approximation to see what the benefit it. Also on Master Tactician I don't have any logic in there for increased chance of re-proc due to the increase crit chance while it is active.<br>
<br>
If you have better ideas on how to model these I'd love to hear them.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_284453"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->It would be nice to be able to compare rapid fire (+quickshot if you have it) dps (which will be too fast to weave steady unless you chose a ridiculously slow weapon) to not using rapid fire, or chosing to waste (most of) the benefit by still weaving steady regardless.<br>
<br>
That is, maybe when your between autoshots time falls between 1-1.5 sec, it's better to steady (and auto) every 1.5 sec, but when it's &lt;1 sec, you do better with just arcane+auto (multi would slow the auto as well) ... also keeping in mind that with rapid fire on, quickshot is likely to refresh itself toward the end as well.<br>
<br>
I've considered *not* taking imp aoth just so I don't have to adapt so much.<br>
<br>
If switching bows specifically for rapid fire or quickshot, the ideal time to do this is immediately after an autoshot fires, right?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Cool, I'm not the only one who saw a stair-step function when they did this.<br>
<br>
I like this idea better than what I did, where I just figured in extra % damage from the uptime.<br>
<br>
So if I were to model this, would I want to just reduce the cooldown of autoshot, and the casting time of Steady by the uptime*bonus? I think that would be the best way to "average" out the effects, which is what I'd be looking for in a spreadsheet.<br>
<br>
Did this test get performed with a full 5 ranks in Improved Aspect of the Hawk? I only ask because there are different "steps" I've found with lower ranks. And slightly different amounts of "proc within a proc" due to the extra shot at different weapon speeds. I'm pretty sure that would all be noise though.<br>
<br>
I'm going to compare these results to what I currently have in my spreadsheet and see how close we are. I like your methodology better, and the fact that you regressed it to a single equation that's pretty accurate is great!<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Yeah, test was with all 5 ranks of IAotH.  It doesn't really make sense to me to get less than 5/5 if you are going to get it, since each point builds on the last.  Although I can see why you would want to model that for completeness sake.<br>
<br>
Using the same methods, for 4/5 IAotH I get: y = 0.7721x^-0.7275<br>
<br>
So there is a change, albeit a minor one.  If I have time later I might run it across all ranks.<br>

I've been messsing around with it abit and I stumbled upon a few questions (2 so far xD)<br>
<br>
First of all, is the weapon skill rating working? Doesn't seem to effect DPS if I play with the numbers there. <br>
<br>
Secondly, I'm quite confused with how the Shots fields work (i.e. Seconds between Auto Shots). I have some idea, but it would help alot if you could explain abit how to use it properly. :)<br>

		<div id="post_message_284601"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Back when the first changes were announced I briefly considered *not* taking the Improved Arcane Shot talent. Have you been considering any potentional benefits of a 6 sec Arcane Shot over 5 sec Arcane Shots? Being able to spend 5 points elsewhere might improve overall performance. I know this is not directly related to the spreadsheet, but then it would affect your cycle.<br>
<br>
On the subject of Beast Mastery, I would definitely consider implenting a section for pets. Most of the pet DPS is not dependant on hunter actions, it would depend on gear and with Kill Command, you can affect your pets DPS with your ranged weapon. Besides that tho, seeing how viable the tree is and with the announcement of more pet abilities, I would've been interested in being able to calculate pet specific things.<br>
<br>
I think you'll know what Talents to include from the BM tree ( :P ) and the other trees and the model will be complete once one could take into account the pet specific ability (Lightning Breath etc.) and Kill Command.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I'm glad you are enjoying it.<br>
<br>
I included some newer gear in the version I posted yesterday afternoon (Version 3). There are a couple of reasons why I have the gear listing hidden:<br>
1 - I'm a bit of a control freak.<br>
2 - By forcing people to tell me what gear/gems/enchants are missing, I learn about them. If anyone could just change it themsleves they probably would, and no on else might benefit (also see #1).<br>
3 - Those pages aren't exactly in the nicest format. And there are a lot of them. I use a separate page for each slot, and 1 for gems. I figured no one really wanted to see all that junk. If you spot a bug in the numbers you see for a specific item, it's easy enough for me to correct and re-post. (also see #1 - there is a pattern here)<br>
<br>
I'm hoping to update the spreadsheet every couple of days for new gear. Thottbat and Kaliban's (the 2 sources I've been using) are being updated daily. I don't think even all the items from the heroic 5 mans are in the sheet yet.<br>
<br>
If there are sets of gear or specific items you'd like added you can send me a private message here (when they are back up) or at my guild website (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080330030620/http://www.havoc-guild.us/" target="_blank">Havoc</a>).<br>
<br>
I'm also still looking for accurate racial stats and base health/mana for non-Trolls. Right now those are all way off. (I actually think my health totals are off even for Trolls...)<br>

</div>Plugging this into my spreadsheet I've found your numbers work out to be about 20-25% less than what I was using. Yours do "feel" more correct, as well as being based on a more solid method of simulation. I have always thought I was overestimating the impact of a tier 1 talent. My next version will remove that huge lookup table and just substitute in your equation.<br>

		<div id="post_message_284800"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->So Lactose thanks for the spreadsheet. Quick question though, as noted above would it be correct to believe that a quick ranged weapon is really that much better then a slow/medium speed one?<br>
<br>
The Consortium Blaster is showing to greatly lose out (I am a MM build) to the Wrathfire Handcannon:<br>
<br>
Consortium Blaster<br>
111 - 207 Damage Speed 2.40 <br>
(66.3 damage per second)<br>
+15 Stamina<br>
Durability 75 / 75<br>
Requires Level 70<br>
Requires The Consortium - Revered <br>
Equip: Improves critical strike rating by 7.<br>
Equip: Increases attack power by 36. <br>
<br>
Wrathfire Hand-Cannon<br>
Binds when picked up<br>
Gun90 - 168 Damage Speed 2.00 <br>
(64.5 damage per second)<br>
Durability 75 / 75<br>
Requires Level 68 <br>
Equip: Improves critical strike rating by 15.<br>
Equip: Increases attack power by 40. <br>
  <br>
The numbers I am seeing are 830 DPS versus 912 DPS, quite a huge difference IMO.<br>
I was under the impression because I am speced for multi shot dmg, the slower wep would help me do more dmg per MS.<br>
<br>
Would it be wise to go with slower weapons in BC now then? Thos Karaz epics included?<br>
<br>
Thanks alot.<br>

		<div id="post_message_284814"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->@Lactose. Apologies If I have the wrong version or am missing something, I'm sort of rushed. But,<br>
<br>
1. The formulas for both arcane shot average and multishot average appear incorrect.  For example, B176 upon simplification appears to return B175*B151, which is Multishot crit.  This explains why changing entries in Improved Barrage have no impact on the final DPS calculations. Likewise, B164 returns B163*B151, basically arcane crit.<br>
<br>
2. The logical statements you use to build the raw numbers from row 157 onwards are sensitive to B94 and B97, which are sensitive to B29 and B31 (also the C column for new DPS I suppose).  You might want to change the default return on, for example, B97/C97 and B94/C94 to be max rank because as written with no entries in B29/C29 and B31/C31, the arcane and multishot damage gets computed as zero literally (not simply min zero added damage).<br>
<br>
Nice work as always.  <br>
<br>
This should impact the agi/crit/rap tradeoffs (assuming there are indeed errors and I am not missing something).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
That way, a cryptic formula like  <br>
( ( C:C + D:D ) / 2 ) / E:E<br>
<br>
would look like <br>
( ( LowDmg + HighDmg ) / 2 ) / Speed<br>

which is a lot easier to understand and troubleshoot.<br>
<br>
The option to name a column or cell can be found on Insert &gt; Name &gt; Define or simply use the name box at the upper left corner of the spreadsheet.<br>

		<div id="post_message_285762"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I'm debating whether to switch from Scryers to Aldor just for the shoulder enchant (20 AP 15 crit for scryer, 30 AP 10 crit for aldor). On your spreadsheet the Scryer one is only better at very high levels of RAP and low levels of crit. I don't think I'll ever be running 5k AP and 15% crit, so the Aldor one would be a better choice.<br>
<br>
Lactose, how accurate do you think your spreadsheet is right now? I'd hate to switch over and then find out there's an error and the Scryer one is better.<br>

</div>Disregarding a couple of minor bugs that I've corrected locally (Focused Fire not being applied, corrected average damage for Multi-Shot and Arcane Shot), and the stuff I obviously haven't added yet (lots of talents, pet stuff, etc), it should be pretty darn accurate, to be honest.<br>
My main problem is finding a way to put numbers on shots; how many you use and how long it takes (DPS issues...). Basically, if you input stuff and you're able to reproduce that "rotation" ingame, it should be accurate.<br>
Keep in mind I haven't documented it all yet though, so you might be missing something I'm not seeing ;)<br>
<br>
At the moment I feel like I'm at a minor road block with those shots. No ETA on new update.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I think its a very nice sheet wit a lot of work in it. I have one little suggestion. You even went through the trouble to enter the colors of slots of the items with their respective socket bonus. As far as I'm concerned I find it hard to see a use in socketing the sockets with something else then red gems, maybe a yellow one here and there. But using blue ones, which appear a lot makes me loose more dps then the socket bonus can compensate, if the bonus gives dps at all.<br>
So it would be great if you left the option to use all kinds of gems for any slot.<br>

Each race gets exactly the same stats as they level up, so just figure out how much you gained from lvl 1 and use that number and add it to the base value which is listed on this page to determine the lvl 70 stats of other races.<br>

		<div id="post_message_305658"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I added a small windserpent section to the spreadsheet to see the total damage done by hunter and the pet. Since the LB nerf, since LB is almost not scaling at all with AP, the value of hunter AP to pet dps is a lot les contributing than before while the crit chance of the hunter still plays a big role due to GFTT. Now after putting in the first numbers to see how much AP and how much crit rating gives the same overall damage boost, with no additional pet dps talents in BM tree, 1 crit rating is worth 1.48 AP for me.<br>
<br>
Without contributing the pet part, it was 1 crit rating = 1.35 AP for me. I'll add some of the pet talents to the spreadsheet, stuff like Unleashed Fury and Ferocity. I'll stay away from the pet procs for this time being.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I've just tested this on version 7, and it seems to be working. I get the start of the arcane at 0, the end of the arcane at 0, the start of the Auto at 0, and the end of the auto at 0.5. I think you may be looking for the cast start time to be delayed 0.5 seconds with a 0 second cast time. What I have implemented it as is a 0.5 second cast time. The DPS will be calculated for both shots over 0.5 seconds of time, which is accurate with what you'd see in game.<br>
<br>
Your changes would put a 0.5 second cast delay on Arcane shot. It wouldn't effect Auto shot at all.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>No need to apologize. It's important to me to get this working as well as I can.  I use it myself for deciding what gear to focus on getting or spend DKP on. Please continue to put it through it's paces. I'm sure there are tons of flaws and bugs in it still. Latest version (8) fixes (among other things) the upper damage of the Wrathfire Hand Cannon (168 vs. 186 - typo) which had been looking like the best ranged weapon in the game with the bug.<br>
<br>
I am wondering if anyone knows the math behind proc over time items. I specifically ask because the Mark of Conquest trinket is working out to a ridiculous amount of mana regeneraton. I'm seeing a proc rate of between 8-9% on all shots. It would be nice to figure out if this scales based on weapon speed or not. I'm just not familiar with the TheoryCraft behind this mechanic.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_309557"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Well given that this is the Hunter Spreadsheets thread, I'm moving all further discussion to this thread:<br>
<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080423065336/http://www.lurchington.com/misc/hunter_list.xls" target="_blank">http://www.lurchington.com/misc/hunter_list.xls</a> (updated pretty often)<br>

<br>
Goal:<br>
Provide a summary of what items I should be looking for in each slot, where they're from, and a quick snapshot of what they're worth. This was originally a personal project, so it was Horde, scryer only, with no profession BOPs, but I've completed enough that I'm trying to fill it out.<br>
<br>
Currently:<br>
Has a selection of items in each of the inventory slots, with what I've deemed as relevant stats for each. The front page has a set of constants up for a Pawn-style ratings estimate. You're encouraged to use your own constants for ranking. Includes gems at the front, and enchants per slot.<br>
<br>
To add:<br>
Fill out missing alliance, aldor and profession BOP items<br>
Include leather<br>
Include key items from pre-tbc<br>
Add better logic for using gems in their correct slotted color, and handling gem bonuses better<br>
Create some sort of summary page that shows what you have per slot, versus best available<br>
Add in some sort of Item level / item level estimate similar to the calculator posted in public discussion<br>
<br>
Suggestions that might be beyond the scope of this spreadsheet:<br>
<br>
Combining it with other spreadsheets, especially Lactose's.<br>
- I'll attempt to keep my lists updated, but I'm not intending this as an all-in-one solution.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_309906"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->First, assume you already know your relative value for RAP and crit rating.  How much RAP do you effectively get from a 12dmg scope?  I'll only look at one scenario: a steady shot and auto shot every 2.3 sec (yes, I know you can fit an arcane/multi instead of a single steady, or other variants).<br>
<br>
"damage" below is before crit, of course.<br>
<br>
dps added per real RAP = 1dps/14rap+((.2 dmg/2.3 sec)/rap)) = .158 dps/rap<br>
dps added from 12dmg scope = (12dmg/2.3sec) = 5.2dps = (.158dps/rap)*[33rap]<br>
<br>
That is, you can value the scope like 33rap.<br>
<br>
Except at retard-gear values of weapon dps and rap, 28 crit is at least as good as 37rap (i.e. better than 33rap).   So the crit scope wins, barely (not considering GFTT or other crit based effects).   Crit looks even better as you increase your rap and ranged weapon dps.  On the other hand, very fast (BM) hunters should probably value the two premier scopes about equally for now.<br>
<br>
The accurascope is, of course, better than both if you somehow can use all that hit rating.  I can't.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Yes, that's the consensus (haven't checked it myself).  Sorry if I wasn't clear.  The above calculation did indeed only consider a khorium scope increase in damage for autoshot; it's just that the dps is turned into faux rap since I'm used to comparing crit and rap for value.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_312450"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Hi all. First, thanks Lurch for all the work. You have made my life much easier as a Hunter. I do have a question for all the Hunters out there. I realize that stamina has no affect on one's dps, and is therefore not accounted for in Pawn or the AEP figures from the other thread. But, I can't help but feel that stamina is somewhat important; how much, I don't know. My question is this. Are any of you changing the constants, whether it be Pawn or AEP, and assigning any weight to stamina, and if so, how much? For example, 2 items are within 3 Pawn rating points of one another, but the lower item has 30 stamina associated with it. I would assume everyone would go ahead and take the lower of the two items.

Just curious if I am the only one out there thinking this way, or if others are reworking the numbers with a small value for stamina? Thanks in advance.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_312489"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Thank you Bryne. Yes, I understand precisely what you are saying. An example if I may. If you had two items to choose from. Item (a) was 'worth' 200 and item (b) was worth 190, but item (b) had +30 stamina. Which item would you choose? If you say item (b), then you are placing a value on stamina, however small. But, I totally understand what you're saying.

		<div id="post_message_312521"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Honestly, I see it as very much identical to wearing resistance gear, when you need it, you put it on. I'd gladly use cloth with -stamina as long as I didn't die, if it gave the most DPS.<br>
<br>
I always try to keep a little stock of items that, even thought they might not offer as much pure DPS as my current gear, serve their use otherwise. Examples might be +hit gear after you're hitcapped, just in case you need to swap out some of your regular gear for resistance / stamina, etc.<br>

Cheeky: I've been playing around with your spreadsheet, but I've run across a strange phenomenon and I'm not sure whether it's "true," or simply an artifact and/or error (whether mine or the spreadsheet's). I selected a full set of tier 2 gear, full MM talents (including IAotH), and a GM bow. I used your prioritization for shot rotation (multi&gt;steady), and came up with a hunter-only DPS of 841.28. I then started to play around with alternate bows (recalculating the shot rotation each time), but discovered that the GM bow gave me a higher DPS than <i>every</i> other ranged weapon on your list (again, hunter DPS only - it was even further ahead when you considered pet DPS, probably due to GftT). <br>
<br>
I figured that faster bows would have a slight edge due to the increased IAotH proc, but there's something not quite right when a 55.8 DPS/1.8 speed bow calculates a higher DPS output then the  73.8 DPS/2.8 gladiator crossbow. I ran these numbers without IAotH and obtained similar results, which makes me think that there's something fishy about the calculations somewhere. Or are faster bows really <i>that</i> much better?<br>
<br>
(Edit: If I only use autoshot and/or multishot, the values look more reasonable. I think the reason the GM/HW bow gives such a high DPS output is that you're basically able to fit in a steady shot between each autoshot without any "wasted" time. This means less longevity, I'm guessing, but higher DPS output during that time since the ratio of steady shot damage/autoshot damage is much higher.)<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>The Shot Rotation has a couple of modeling weak points, and your specific comparisons hit them pretty squarely.<br>
<br>
1) There is no allowance for lag. I have had a request for this, and I am going to allow users in the next version to specify a delay to be added to all triggerable cast start times. Putting 0.1 or 0.2 seconds in for that should lower the HW bow DPS by quite a bit.<br>
<br>
2) I model IAotH by averaging out the haste gains into a static effect. What this does is put each autoshot cooldown and Steady Shot cast time into a "middle ground" that is not achievable in the game. You are either not in Quick Shots, in which case everything is slower; or you are, and things are much quicker (and the HW bow clips every auto shot, nullifying the benefit entirely.)<br>
<br>
Your specific example looks real good because you have a 0 second reaction time, and the averaged Autoshot cycle time for the HW is 1.45 seconds. But Steady Shot cast time is averaged to 1.21 seconds. In effect the HW bow is clipping each autoshot by 1.21 - (1.45 - 0.5) = .17 seconds. If you have even a slight lag/reaction time this is going to be much worse, and the bow looks as crappy at level 70 as it really is.<br>
<br>
To really see what the normal cast times are I would recommend turning off Hawk as an aspect on the Shot Rotation and adding 155 RAP to the Gear page's hand adjustment field to get a better idea of the shot times. This will turn off the IAotH effects without costing you the RAP.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_340539"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->For the past couple weeks I've been working on developing my own spreadsheet, mostly for my own enjoyment and use.  I take all the stats on an item and convert them to their equivalent value in Attack Power.  I don't, however, use a static value for each stat, but I calculate it using partial derivatives of the damage formulae.  When I had started working on it, I didn't see a spreadsheet that came at it from this angle.<br>
<br>
The spreadsheet itself is similar to Lactose's in that you manually enter your stats and the stats for the items you want to compare, however I also provide a section for you to input your own shot rotation (it must repeat), as it can play a role in the relative value of a stat.  In the talents section, it is currently set for the proposed talents in 2.1.<br>

Anyhow, just thought I'd share.<br>

</div>Lag is irrespective of the macro. Just because you mash it continuously and get it to trigger as soon as the <i>client</i> allows you to does not mean the <i>server</i> gets it at the same time. If it takes 200 ms for the client to communicate to the server you see a 200 ms delay in whatever you do.<br>
<br>
This is why for high-latency environments it is better to hand-cast your shots and time the Steady Shot so you press the key <b>before</b> the autoshot timer has expired. The latency from your client to the sever allows the server time to complete the effects of the autoshot cast and then processes your Steady cast immediately. Of course, if you go too early you just interrupt the auto and get the clobbered auto shots we're all such big fans of.<br>
<br>
I believe latency will always punish faster weapons more than slower weapons. Unless you happen to be playing on the same LAN as the sever. <!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_341600"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I hope I'm not asking too much with this:<br>
<br>
We have some really really stubborn hunters. I've been getting a debate started about their dps (some use AoTV and AS+MS spam.. :'( constantly clipping autoshots aswell) and already posted some tips about steadyshot/auto macro and the spreadsheet. <br>
<br>
Still, I dont think the information I gave them was enough. Would it be possible to set up a small list of tips ('best practices: hunter dps' if you must :p )? If they dont believe that what you say is true, I'll just scan every hunter topic on this forum -again- and slap them with math.<br>
<br>
Much appreciated<br>
<br>
ps: I've used the search function and has read most of the latest hunter topics, but my knowledge about hunters is far from sufficient to come up with this kind of 'small list'.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

(I'm running WWS on all our dps from now on :p )<br>

Just need some baselines.. Like: Dont even bother using AS/MS with a 2.6 or faster (pre quiver) bow. (if this is even correct?)<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

1) Get LittleTrouble or zHuntermod.  Something to give them an auto shot cast bar.<br>
<br>
2) Use a steady shot in between each auto shot.  If they resist getting an auto shot cast bar, have them use the following macro.  They can just mash it to the same effect.<br>

I've been toying around with your spreadsheet a bit, and I was wondering if there's a way to access the gear lists. While I CAN use the hand adjustment, it's not the most convenient way to do things. If possible, can you give users more clear access to the gear lists? There are a number of items I'd like to add, but it's unclear to me how to even access the list. Along the same lines, is it possible for users to help update the gear library to keep in up to date while alleviating some of the work for you? If not, I understand. Thanks for the work you've already done.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I think this would be a great idea as well. I realize that it'd create a slew of new tabs (since based on your calculations, you have a separate tab for each gear slot), but I think the additional customization would be useful.<br>
<br>
A couple of other potential improvements (other than the latency issue that I know you're already working on) would be the addition of standard buffs (including kings, which requires a bit more hardcoding) and factoring in glancing blows/dodges/parries for pet DPS. A method of direct gear comparison might also be helpful as well (i.e. look at the change in DPS if swapping one piece of gear for another).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I have been hesitant to open up the gearing sections for a bunch of reasons. The largest of these are selfishness. If I let anyone go ahead and fix the mistakes and ommisions I'll never learn about them. Right now I get a few messages a week of things that are missing or wrong. I can then fix/add those changes and re-release. To me everyone wins that way. (And I am an incredible control freak, and like protecting the mind-numbing hours it took to input and maintain that data.)<br>
<br>
There was a movement a while a go to standardize the gear lists in the various spreadsheets. Does anyone know what happened to that effort?<br>
<br>
Here is a preview of the features already implemented for version 12. I am holding off on releasing it because it has all the 2.1 changes in it.<br>
 - Corrected bug in Expose Weakness. Updated rates to 2.1 talents<br>
 - Added Combra Reflexes<br>
 - Modeled Kill Command DPS. See <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080317231731/http://forums.tkasomething.com/viewtopic.php?p=40187#40187" target="_blank">thread on TKASomething</a> for explanation of the math.<br>
 - Modeled new Hunter's Mark. (currently as having to be reapplied, but will just assume 440 RAP with changes on PTR.)<br>
 - Added armor mitigation to pet's attacks.<br>
 - Added in Gronnstalker Armor for shits and giggles.<br>
 - Added Raid Buffs. Blessings/elixirs/flasks/etc. Enforce 2 Elixirs or 1 flask rule. R2.1 flask stats, and added in buffs for pets.<br>
 - Added in Helath/Mana enchants for chest<br>
 - Added Dodge and Glancing Blow calculations to pet's DPS.<br>
 - Changed Survival Instincts to be as it is in 2.1 (Better per point than Master Marksman in a lower part of the tree...)<br>
 - All pet data sheets have been hidden to reduce clutter.<br>
 - Calculations for Romulo's Poison Vial have been added. This just computes DPS gain right now, but is not factored into DPS listed for the Hunter.<br>
<br>
I guess there are quite a few changes. Now would be a good time to ask for new stuff.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Can't say I blame you. A possible compromise would be to add a tab for the addition of a limited number of new items (for example, a block of 3-5 for each gear slot that would be reflected on each of your hidden tabs). This would prevent mucking with your hard work while still allowing atypical (green resist pieces, for example) or theoretical items to be compared.<br>

</div>Wow, lots of nice additions! You didn't include latency in your list, which is the change I'm most interested in, but I think you've already said that it'll be included in your next version. (Sidenote, did you model it by adding latency to the cast time of every non-autoshot?)<br>
<br>
When hiding tabs, you might also consider hiding the Race and Level tabs as well (Level could be combined with the Calculations page if you wanted it visible).<br>
<br>
Oh, and one possible error: Ravager is listed as not having bite, when Petopia says it's a trainable skill. I haven't trained one myself, so not sure which is accurate. Also, Gore will need the 1.5x damage modifier.<br>
<br>
Thanks again for all your effort, this really is a quality piece of work!<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Can't say I blame you. A possible compromise would be to add a tab for the addition of a limited number of new items (for example, a block of 3-5 for each gear slot that would be reflected on each of your hidden tabs).

</div>I haven't worked much with drop-down lists myself, but something that might work is to simply add a few lines at the end of your current gear lists that simply refer to the custom gear page. Include those referencing lines from your individual tabs in your drop-down list (i.e. widen the range to include those extra lines) and then you don't have to worry about directly looking up from multiple tabs. (NB: It may require that the custom lists all receive dummy names for selection purposes, such as Neck 1, Neck 2, etc.)<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I'm not sure the best method for modeling dragonspine trophy. One method would be to determine the average added haste, but given the low attack speeds that you get with BM this may not yield accurate results (that is to say that you are required to adjust your rotation to priority when speed gets too low to avoid clipping autoshots). If you're willing to accept that as a simplistic model (it would probably not be representative of a real life situation due to the adjusted rotation) I reckon it's around 9% time averaged haste (325 haste * 10s/60 s/m*1.7ppm = 92 haste rating = 8.76% haste). Honestly, though, I'm not sure what the best method of modeling it is.<br>

</div>Hmm. I'll think about this a while. I'm not thrilled with what we have for Quick Shots for the same reason. It's a binary effect that we are smoothing into an average. Only problem is the average is not something you'd ever see at any one point.<br>
<br>
The way I handle ppm is to figure out what the precentage would be based on the un-hasted auto shot speed, and then compute up time based on the shots per second I can derive from the Shot Rotation. So if it is a 1.7 ppm trinket a Hunter is going to see a hell of a lot more benefit than 8.76%.<br>
<br>
Some simple math:<br>
2.8 speed weapon - 1.7 ppm means 7.93% chance on any hit.<br>
<br>
2.8 speed with quiver and trinket proc'd is 1.86s<br>
Simple Auto/special rotation is still possible, but tricky. 2 shots every 1.86 seconds.<br>
Chance to be in proc is the chance any attack in the last 10 seconds proc'd it. That would be: 1-(1 - chance)^floor(10/.93) = 1 - (.9207 ^ 10) = 56.23% uptime.<br>
<br>
Wow, that's a lot of uptime. Is this the kind of effect people are seeing? That's an average gain of 182.75 haste rating, or 17.4% haste. It's like having another quiver. Since you can still maintain a steady/auto roatation with slower bows this is a 17.4% DPS gain. Good lord that's sweet.<br>
<br>
Of course, it wouldn't be possible to handle it with Quick Shots, Berzerk, or Rapid Fire at the same time. And Serpent's Swiftness would really be a pain in the ass without the Arena Xbow.<br>

</div>I agree using the average haste is probably a bad idea. I'm really not great at modeling probabilistic events, but the percentage time under effect (up time) seems rather higher than I anticipated. Using the converse probability seems to be the way of determining up time, but it definitely strikes me as odd that it would have such a high up-time.<br>
<br>
Indulge me as I step through your math (mostly for my own gratification).<br>
Weapon Speed = 2.8<br>
Shots / Minute = 60 / 2.8 = 21.4<br>
Proc / Minute = 1.7<br>
Procs / Minute / Shots / Minute = 1.7 / 21.4 = 0.079 Procs / Shot<br>
<br>
This is assuming procs / minute gives a percentage based purely on weapon speed (that is, discounting special shots). My question is this: does the chance to proc dynamically look at attack speed for each attack (thus changing the chance to proc depending on if quick shots is up, etc) or does it just use the base weapon speed? If it uses the base weapon speed, Dragonspine is pretty much godly for hunters. If not, I don't know - I'd have to see empirical data or a thorough model. If it uses attack speed rather than weapon speed, up time would be something like this (assuming only autoshots):<br>
<br>
Weapon Speed = 2.9/(1.15*1.20)=2.10<br>
AutoShots / Minute = 60 / 2.10 = 28.6<br>
Procs / Shot = 1.7 / 28.6 = 0.059 procs/shot<br>
<br>
Uptime During Rotation (using auto/steady rotation)<br>
Hasted Speed = 2.90 / (1.31 * 1.15 * 1.20) = 1.60 / 2 = 0.80 (steady/auto rotation)<br>
Uptime = 1-(1-0.059)^floor(10/0.80) = 1 - (0.0.941^12) = 51.8% uptime<br>
<br>
I used a different weapon speed than you did (wanted to model for Sunfury speed, since that seems to be the most common weapon used), but the difference will only be slight. Even if attack speed is used instead of weapon speed the up time is significant (assuming it can proc on yellow hits, of course).<br>
<br>
My gut feeling is that every time you shoot the game determines the chance to proc based on attack speed. If not then this trinket is retardedly good for a hunter, in terms of percentage time under effect (and uniquely so, as hunters have more haste effects available as a class through talents and quivers/ammo pouches than other classes have). Obviously some testing is in order to verify this (I didn't have the DKP to get the dragonspine we had drop last night or I'd gladly do it...QQ). Can someone verify if it can proc from yellow hits or only white hits and what the approximate chance to proc per shot is (try not to use quick shots / AotH for consistency)?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I include this only for completeness - I'm not sure it would really make that large a difference.<br>

I'd really like to improve the iAotH calculations, I'm too German to accept the approximations. I'm going to try and math it from an individual shot standpoint.  I want to improve the calculations, no offence is intended to those who did the current calculations.<br>
<br>
But first I want to clarify the mechanics of iAotH so we are all on the same page.<br>
<br>
- iAoth has a 10% chance to proc on auto shot<br>
- It procs the instant the shot leaves the bow, so travel time is not an issue.<br>
- The first shot (the shot it procs off) does NOT receive the haste bonus (I tested this awhile ago, but not 100% sure)<br>
- If the proc expires directly after an auto, the auto will still receive the haste bonus, the next auto will not be hastened.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I hope you do come up with a better way to model it. If you do I'd love to incorporate it into my spreadsheet. Please post your model and thought process here. There are a lot of smart people (Lactose, Glau, etc.) who might be able to help you out.</div>

</div>Time averaging is a valid method of modeling a probabilistic effect over a very large sample size. Unfortunately, I think the issue here is that given the mechanics that hunters have (i.e. shot rotations that do not proportionately scale down with haste due to GCD/clipping problems) you will see increasing divergence between theory and practice as speed scales down. It seems to me that the best method of modeling would be discrete modeling (which is essentially what Glau did in his simulations). Unfortunately, discrete simulation can't be done easily by a spreadsheet. Unless someone wants to write simulation software (which, to me, would be the most accurate way to do things, but also the least convenient to revise) that takes information from a character sheet and then simulates an arbitrarily large number of combat sequences to determine average dps, we pretty much are going to have to live with approximate models based on continuous functions.<br>
<br>
Perhaps this belongs in the hunter mechanics thread, but I'll share it here [admin move it if deemed necessary]; one thought that has been rolling around inside my skull for a while is modeling the shot rotation as overlapping waveforms. I haven't fleshed out the idea completely (or, in my opinion, adequately enough to warrant sharing yet, but nonetheless...), but depending on your first shot you can model autoshot as either a sine or cosine function of attack speed (For example, values of 1 would correspond to autoshot fires whereas values of -1 would be 90 degrees out of phase with auto shot - the ideal time to fire a special shot). Likewise, any shot in your rotation can be modeled using sine or cosine (again, depending on which shot you lead with; ideally values of 1 would correspond to a value of -1 on the autoshot waveform). The real bugaboo seems, to me, to be determining how to best use such a model. Perhaps someone can share thoughts regarding this (or am I way out in left field on this one)?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_345607"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Here's my thinking:<br>
<br>
We can calculate the average length of a 'no-proc streak'  That's easy, it's just 10 shots since it's a 1/10 chance.<br>
<br>
Then we can calculate the length of a 'proc steak' or how many hastened shots we get when iAotH does proc.  It's slightly more complex because it will proc off itself.<br>
<br>
If you have the averge # of shots in a 'no-proc streak' and the average number of shots in a 'proc streak'  then it's a simple to find the effect of the procs.  The thing I really like about this, is that the average effect is the same for close bow speeds which makes intuitive sense to me.  <br>

I'll crunch some #'s and post a formula.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>That's a good point, I guess I was unclear on that. You certainly wouldn't want to start a shot 90 degrees out of phase with an auto, but rather at some point during that gap (I used 90 degrees out of phase as a rough ideal point, since obviously that's exactly the midpoint between two autoshots). I know enough about waveforms to poke around, but it's certainly not my specialty. I only mention it because, as I said, it occurs to me that more often than not the shot rotation (or, at least, the BM rotation of priority replacement) resembles out of phase waveforms. A MM rotation with two specials would certainly be an interesting set of waveforms - one that I'm by no means going to tackle in the near term.<br>
<br>
As for the casting time, it's somewhat simple: the casting time is a function of haste and you can tell when you need to start casting by subtracting the time for casting from the time at which you need to fire to maintain a non-clipped rotation. As I said, I am very very far from fleshing this out, it's the germ of an idea currently. It may not be worth pursuing, but I thought I would get comments/suggestions.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Warning: wild speculation ahead<br>
My feelings on the best way to model that would be to use an alternating series that accomodates for the delay from previous shots. My gut reaction is that because you're using sine/cosine to model shot time (which is continuous) but are really more interested in discrete events (shots) you would use a series that is essentially a time function that accounts for the time delay on the nth shot - for this case it would be a relatively (note: heavily stressing relatively) easy task to determine shot delay. As alluded to before, at this point I can only speculate on possible methods to account for delay, since I haven't worked out the math yet. Hopefully you kind of see where I'm headed with this line of thinking, though.<br>
<br>
Despite all the mathematical masturbation, I maintain that discrete simulation is just going to be better than a generalized model. Likewise, empirical evidence from gameplay will surpass simulation in accuracy. It's just the order of things, really. Nonetheless, it would be valuable to have a reasonable model of shot rotations that does not rely on time averaging (which, unfortunately, appears to be a nontrivial task).<br>
<br>
As for iAotH, here are my feelings: if you want to use average time of non-proc streaks, you're using time averaging. The 10% proc rate is only a valid number for extremely large sample sizes. Given that, as I understand it, your goal is to eliminate time-averaged accounting for haste effect and replace it with a more accurate model (which I can only gather would have to be discrete), you're on the wrong foot here. I can only echo the thoughts of others: I dislike modeling iAotH as a time-averaged percent increase in haste, but I don't have an alternative model that doesn't rely on simulation. I think Glau more or less did the best work possible in terms of describing it generally - if you want more accuracy, you have to independently simulate it for yourself.</div>

		<div id="post_message_345696">The idea I'm currently working on regarding IAotH would be to have the user specify 2 shot rotations. One with no Quick Shots and one with. We can then determine the uptime of Quick Shots (pretty simple function) and ratio the DPS between the 2 rotations by that value.<br>
<br>
This wouldn't be exact, but it does cover the cases where you don't clip in non-Quick Shots, but do clip when you look at the current averages. BM Hunters could specify a every-other auto/special QS rotation, where MM could drop down to 1 special/auto for QS rotation.<br>
<br>
It also has the benefit of seeing the exact effects of Rapid Fire, Beast Within, trinkets, and racials both in and out of QS. Just playing around with the rotations could let you know exactly when to pop what.<br>
<br>
It wouldn't be too hard for me to add, but might be a large pain in the ass to configure 2 rotations. I could add in buttons to speed that up with some standard stuff like I have now.<br>
<br>
I figure uptime is calculated no different than Frenzy or Expose Weakness would be, and we seem to have a pretty solid handle on those abilities.<br>
<br>
Any thoughts?</div>

</div>I may be misunderstanding you, but I'm not sure I see the added value of this method. We already know (maybe not? My impression is that we've accepted converse probability as a method of determining uptime as a community at large) that the average up-time on iAotH is 1-0.15^floor(10/ attack speed under QS) so I'm not sure how the ratio of the dps between the two rotations would be any different. If you're modeling Quick Shots as % uptime * % haste to get the average haste and using that as a flat increase in dps (as a consequence of being a flat increase in haste) then the ratio of the two rotations is going to be just % uptime * % haste.<br>
<br>
More clearly, let<br>
A = rotation dps w/o QS<br>
B = % uptime * % haste for QS = average haste benefit of QS<br>
A*B = rotation dps w/ QS<br>

(A*B)/(A)=B<br>
<br>
Am I grossly misunderstanding what your intention is or is there some breakdown in communication? I'm not sure this would give us any more information than we have now - other than providing redundant sets of data for QS and non-QS rotations.<br>

As for just providing the option for a second rotation while under haste, it might be nice to have something like a checklist of haste buffs - as BM I frequently have stacked haste, resulting in small attack speeds.

What you have is pretty much exactly what is done now. The only problem is you take a weapon with speed X, then figure that IAotH adjusts to Y over very long periods of time. And that's fine, as far as auto shot DPS goes.<br>
<br>
But in reality you have either X or Z (X/1.15) all of the time, you never actually see Y in game. Tuning a rotation around Y is problematic because that is a timing pattern that doesn't exist.<br>
<br>
Right now my spreadsheet says you'll do D DPS using a Steady + Special/Auto rotation, but it's not really true. For some bows the Quick Shot proc prevents you from actually maintaining anything more than auto/special. While it probably doesn't have a huge effect in the grand scheme, of things my entire methodology in the spreadsheet breaks down for very fast bows. It makes them look better than they already are. I'd like to explore some ideas on fixing that.</div>

But in reality you have either X or Z (X/1.15) all of the time, you never actually see Y in game. Tuning a rotation around Y is problematic because that is a timing pattern that doesn't exist.<br>
<br>
Right now my spreadsheet says you'll do D DPS using a Steady + Special/Auto rotation, but it's not really true. For some bows the Quick Shot proc prevents you from actually maintaining anything more than auto/special. While it probably doesn't have a huge effect in the grand scheme, of things my entire methodology in the spreadsheet breaks down for very fast bows. It makes them look better than they already are. I'd like to explore some ideas on fixing that.</div>

</div>Ah now I understand. As far as the 'never attained speed' argument, I wholeheartedly agree. The problem with modeling iAotH as a time-averaged haste increase is that it isn't. You never see the speed you calculate as average because your data set is bimodal - either the speed is hasted or it isn't. Using the mean doesn't really reflect reality IF you have to alter the shot rotation (if you don't, then you could actually model iAotH as a flat haste increase and get away with it).<br>
<br>
I'm starting to see your point about differentiating shot rotations based on haste. Let my reiterate what I understand your idea to be and see if I'm following you now: construct two rotations with and without haste and determine the dps of each. Determine the time under effect for iAotH as a percentage of time as a whole, then weight each of the rotations accordingly and add them together to get total dps. Is that close?<br>
<br>
Assuming the last paragraph is true (or close to true) I'd like to propose a more general method (although strongly based on your last post - admittedly I misunderstood your idea originally and I want to acknowledge that this is strongly based on your post). My suggestion would be to allow a user to select gear/buffs that you have previously modeled to establish time under effect. For example, abacus of violent odds and iAotH; You can easily determine the average time under effect for either of these. What I would then suggest is determine the percentage of time, on average, that you would be under the effects of each permutation thereof - either iAotH, abacus, both, or none - and assign shot rotations to each permutation (and thus to each state of haste). Then weight each rotation based on percentage of time under effect. The sum of these weighted values might more accurately reflect the rotation mechanics while still maintaining their respective weights for up-time.<br>
<br>

</div>This becomes an unbounded problem as more and more haste effects are possible. IAotH is something 95%+ of Hunters seem to have, so it makes sense to have special consideration for it. But you could have Abacus, Dragonspine, Kiss of the Spider, etc. that all come into play. And you could have them stack. I'm not sure I want to add the complexity of modeling them all as separate rotations. It doesn't scale well.<br>
<br>
I provide for triggered effects right now from trinkets. The chance procs are a pain in the ass. And it seems like there is becoming more and more of them around.  I've already decided it's probably worth it to handle IAotH. (I'm sure if that fucking Abacus ever drops for me I'll be in more of a hurry to include it too.) Could we generalize that at most 2 other "on chance" haste effects could come into play - based off of only trinkets exhibiting this property? If so I can include an additional sheet for those and crunch the permutations you discuss. I just want to make sure I don't work beyond the point of diminishing returns with this tool, there is a good chance I passed that line a while ago. </div>

		<div id="post_message_345899">I certainly understand the problem of scaling the modelling problem. The only limitation I see is the limit of only two trinkets available during combat (lets pretend feign/switch doesn't exist, because then you're correct - the problem has no practical upper bound). Perhaps I was overly general in stating the requirement to calculate for all permutations of gear. Rather, calculating based on what gear the player has more or less dictates that there will only be at most 2 on chance haste effects possible (are there non-trinkets that effects ranged haste or proc from ranged attacks? I'm not sure they exist). I do realize that's a tremendous amount of work - I don't honestly expect you to implement that kind of over-arching calculation to the spreadsheet (although it sounds like accomodating iAotH is a feasible option). From a purely theoretical standpoint, however, weighting rotations for time is probably more accurate than modeling iAotH as a flat haste increase.<br>
<br>
Thanks for indulging me in the conversation of that - I realize I occasionally get long-winded.</div>

		<div id="post_message_346253">All well and good for theorycraft but I'd venture that 99% of the time if you tried to drop into new rotations when quick shots came up, being in a variable place in another rotation, you will lose DPS overall.<br>
<br>
Also people keep mentioning that you can be firing so fast that you have to stop steady, why?  Suggesting you stop steady unless you are firing an auto shot every ~0.75 seconds is a drop in DPS.<br>
<br>
If you find yourself in an extreme haste situation (firing shots faster than the global cool), most of the time it is best to drop into spamming your steady/auto macro with a reset of 2 and stopping to toss a special when you can/if you want to.  You won't get a shot off in between every auto and you will delay some autos but your overall damage is much, much higher.</div>

		<div id="post_message_346712">The latest version of Cheeky's spreadsheet attempts to model the new 2.10 Kill Command.  Since Kill Command is fueled by crits, crit rating (and the crit part of agility) become massively more valuable in 2.10 if you plan on spamming Kill Command everytime it's up.  Lactose's spreadsheet still uses current game mechanics, so it doesn't value crit nearly as much.<br>
<br>
That's most likely where the majority of the difference is coming from.<br>
<br>
For my gear and build pre-2.10, stat priority based off itemvalue cost was:<br>
Hit Rating &gt; Agility / AP &gt; Crit Rating<br>
<br>
Using Cheeky's spreadsheet with 2.10 Kill Command Mechanics, this has changed to:<br>

</div>If you are a Survival build the new Expose Weakness rates make Agility very, very valuable. It increases your chance to keep EW up, and increases the benefit from it.<br>
<br>
Survival Hunters are pretty much going to be stacking Agility like hasn't been seen since 1.X again. The advantages to it just scale so well now. You reach a point where each point of Agility is effectively 1.15 * 1.25 * 1.04  = ~1.5 RAP effective on target.<br>
<br>
I break down the differences between character sheet RAP, and the effective RAP on target. Are you seeing changes in the character RAP that are out of line? I won't discount the possiblity of bugs in the sheet, there have been a lot of changes, and not nearly enough time for me to test all talent combinations.</div>

		<div id="post_message_346777">No I'm comparing pure pve MM builds. For Surv both show that +8 AGI &gt; 16 AP for example. But for MM Lactose: 16 AP &gt; 8 AGI but yours other way around. Thats what boggles me. The difference isn't minor.<br>
<br>
What I'm using is comparing the dps change compared to no socket, 8 agi socket and 16 AP socket and see the ratio between the difference. While Lactose's table already have in installed (*hint* wish list ) And shows it I had to do it manually.<br>
<br>
I actually just noticed you are using new Imp mark (440 rap) so I put it in Lactose table. I notices there is a huge difference about fighting 0 mitigation mobs (not using arcane for rotation) So I entered 32% mitigation for both tables:<br>
Lactose: 1 agi = 1.66 RAP (Straight from table)<br>
<br>
Using Cheeky's (Data for hunter only)<br>
+1 AP = 0.183758864 dps<br>
+1 AGI = 0.380008956 dps<br>
AP to AGI ratio: 2.067976194<br>
<br>
Merged with pet dps:<br>
<br>
+1 AP = 0.205799736 dps<br>
+1 AGI = 0.439491411 dps<br>
AP to AGI ratio: 2.135529521<br>
<br>
As you see HUGE difference.<br>
<br>
Now here is something interesting. Removing all mitigation from all calculations (Make Cheeky spreadsheet remove Arcane shot from rotations, and do that same to Lactose by forcing rank 0 on the shot)<br>
<br>
Lactose 1agi = 1.84 rap<br>
<br>
Cheeky (hunter only) 1 agi = 2.068073999 rap<br>
Cheeky (Merged with pet) 1 agi = 2.135723783 rap<br>

		<div id="post_message_346838">It's interesting that you are trying to ratio the DPS gains of the 2 types of stats that way. I don't think I would have thought to do so quite like that.<br>
<br>
Are you using the exact same numbers of the different shots in your rotations? Fundamentally the way we compute damage should be identical based on individual shots, RAP, crit%, talents, etc.<br>
<br>
Did you factor in the +44 more RAP Master Marksman gives you on the new Hunter's Mark? <br>
<br>
To be honest I haven't looked at Lactose's HICS in a while. Looking over it now, he and I use different assumptions in the frequency of shots. I don't think you'll have an easy time lining up much more than a Steady/Auto rotation between the two of them.<br>
<br>
Looking at the way Lactose computes things he handles the combat results table better than I do. Mine allows for you to only crit what hits, instead of treating your crit% as absolute and misses coming from non-crit shots. If anything though, that should increase the value of Agility in his tables.<br>
<br>
I also cannot find any place that Improved Aspect of the Hawk is covered in HICS. It shouldn't really make much of a difference in a steady/auto rotation since it's just a % increase if shots don't get clipped. Your ratios of Agility to RAP to DPS should remain fairly constant.<br>
<br>
Ok, after punching my gear stats, talents, and weapon into Lactose's HICS &amp; setting 0/5 IAotH in mine I get the following results:<br>
HICS - 930.98 DPS, mine - 950.18 DPS - Pretty damn close. I'll investigate what average shot values are later.<br>
HICS - 1 Agility = 2.01 RAP<br>
Cheeky - 1 Agility = .44 DPS, 1 RAP = .24 DPS, 1Agility = 1.83 Agility<br>
<br>
So there is a 10% difference in there. I'll try and delve into the guts of both spreadsheets and see where any discrepencies lie.</div>

And yeah... my suggested rates of firing skills is <b>completely</b> messed up, don't look too much into that.</div>

		<div id="post_message_346901">My numbers before included a screwup on the ammo DPS I put in for HICS.<br>
<br>
Also, HICS does not factor in Focused Fire to damage totals, using the correct ammo and my gear HICS computes the average autoshot to 1099.61, mine 1121.92.  Thats 102% plus some rounding errors. Steady Shot averages are HICS - 1144.97, mine - 1168.19.<br>
<br>
The downside to my shot rotation mechanic is that it is finite. After 50 shots it ends the time computations. This is going to skew the DPS calculations a tad. For the example here of a auto/steady rotation the Shot Rotation grid computes a time of 60.24 seconds for 25 Autos, 25 steadys. With the damages computed above this is 950.42 DPS. Just calculating DPS based on a 2.43 second cycle forever yields 942.43 DPS. I figure 1% difference is enough of a sacrifice in accuracy to allow for complicated shot rotations.<br>
<br>
HICS DPS is 921.88, which is pretty much exactly what you'd get in my sheet by disabling FF and factoring in the Shot Rotation rounding.<br>
<br>
Ok, so we've established Lactose and I are using almost identical formulas for shot damage. Now lets look at how we handle additional stats.<br>
<br>
HICS adds in an additional RAP * LR * CE * MM to the RAP value. He then modifies the crit percentage based on one more agility * LR * CE. HICS computes average autoshot to 1000.18, disabling FF mine is 1000.15. Steady is 1145.55 to 1145.52 to mine. Sicne my sheet derives everything from gearing I don't have anything special to handle an extra stat. It just uses the aggregate you provide through gear and hand adjustments.<br>
<br>
Total DPS computed is +0.48 for HICS, +0.43 for mine. I believe this is due to rounding errors in my calculations. I tend to use floor functions for some things to match tooltip values. It might be worth seeing where I can remove them.<br>
<br>
Doing the same things for +1 RAP is +0.24 HICS, +0.24 mine. Bingo there.<br>
<br>
So you see a few rounding errors in my spreadsheet, which for very minor changes (like 1 Agility or 1 RAP) can be magnified based on how you use them (especially ratioing them against one another). I still feel my spreadsheet works well when comparing different gear/talent/shot rotation combinations. But it's not as exact as HICS on the very fine level.</div>

I have not used Cheeky's at this point so I can not comment on his yet.<br>
<br>
Lactose - I use your spreadsheet primarily as a way to compare possible gear.  I.e. do I want AP gems or crit, gloves #1 or gloves #2 etc.  So what I'll do is enter in all my stats according to my armory info.  I put the same damage values in for weapon excluding any bonuses (no +AP, stamina, crit. .. etc).  In the same weapons section where you can add bonuses, I will input the stats from the two items I am comparing to see which one offers the most benefits based on my toons set up.  That being said, I would really like to have a section where we could enter a piece of armor (very similar to comparing ranged weapons).  <br>
<br>
<br>
On a further tangent, has anyone looked a graphing the AP vs Crit vs DPS to see if a local max can be found?</div>

		<div id="post_message_346977"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->For each individual shot, iAotH is either on or off, so I tried thinking about the problem shot-by-shot instead of per-second.   What I did was calculate the average number of shots a proc lasts, counting reprocs and everything.  I also calculated the number a shots a 'no-proc' streak lasts.<br>
<br>
If we know the average number of shots in a proc chain and the average number of shots between procs we can easily find the average number of hastened shots.<br>
<br>
<b>No-proc Streak:</b><br>
Pretty simple, Hawk has a 1 / 10 chance to proc, the average length of a 'no-proc' streak is 10 slow shots.  The fact that Quick Shots doesn't add haste to the shot it procs off of is accounted for.<br>
<br>
<b>Proc-Streak</b><br>
The length of a chain of procs is a bit harder to model.  But it can be done by calculating the number of fast shots inside a proc, and calculating the chance that one of those shots will chain the proc a second/third/fourth time.  Each extra chained proc adds (on average) half of the duration of the proc. I modelled up to 15 procs in a row.<br>
<br>
One small twist, is that the first shot is not hastened when iAotH procs.  That makes 1st time procs and chained procs behave slightly differently depending on the bow speed.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
After modelling it, I recalculated the probabilities using a Taylor Series and got the same answer.  If you don't know what that is, don't worry, because, I don't really know either I just know it works.<br>
<br>
Here's my calculation Spreadsheet:<br>

<br>
If people like my approach to this, I'll work it into the original spreadsheet.  I could get the whole thing down to 2-3 lines easily, but I don't want to do that before I think people agree with my approach.  I'm always very bad at explaining my mathematical thinking to people, I apologize I'm sure this is confusing.<br>
<br>
I'll be on tomorrow to answer any questions etc.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I guess it all dpends with what you are looking for. I'm going to remove some of the explicit rounding in mine and just scale what the cell shows in terms of precision displayed. Excel keeps all the true values through the calculations to the end. That should eliminate the discrepencies between the output of Lactose's and mine.<br>
<br>
I never really bothered to provide much of a 1 more X or X is equal to so much Y function to mine. I figured you could just make the change at the item/enchant/gem/talent level and see what the result is. If you are comparing 3-4 different item sets of gear I think mine is a bit easier to use, but for heads-up compares Lactose provides both sets of results simultaneously.<br>
<br>
While mine requires me to keep on top of gear stats, it does have the advantage of not requiring you to have Armory, Wowhead or your character available to use. Just pick the gear by name and you're done.<br>
<br>
I have also used my shot rotation to figure out exactly what the best way to use trinkets, racials, rapid fire, etc is. It's nice to be able to say in 12 seconds I can deal X amount of damage every 3 minutes. Without having to hand count shots and total damage up on my own.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I made a 3D graph at one point of crit vs rap at one point, with damage as the z axis, its hard to really infer anything through it though.  There is one for auto shot, multi shot, steady shot, and one for arcane shot, and I used weighting with the results of each to get a combined (rough) "shot rotation" type graph, (4 auto, 3 steady, 2 arcane, 1 multishot) based off the rotation I generally repeat.  I suppose I can divide by a time element to get it for dps as well.<br>
<br>
It showed a definate "sweet spot" in the ap/crit ratio, but by the time I was finished, I wasnt really sure what I was looking for.  I can see where my current stats are on the graph, and decide oh, if I add 40 attack power, and take away 4 crit rating, I'll be right on the sweet spot.  But how do you accomplish that?  I guess you could to a small degree with gems, but what does that accomplish?<br>
<br>
Adding crit always increases damage.  Adding rap always increases damage. Moving towards the sweet spot is fine, but moving away from it will increase your damage as well (as long as its a positive change to ap or crit, depending on which side you fall).<br>
<br>
If I could figure out an exact equation for the crest of the curve, it would be useful, at least for getting an ap/crit ratio, and all the math/calculus I did in college was theoretical, not practical.  Too many Number Theory classes, not enough applied math classes.  Give me real numbers and I'm at a loss.<br>
<br>
Anyways, I can check if I still have them laying around, and post them if you're interested.  They're pretty rudimentary, and I've yet to really find a use, other than looking at pretty colors.  I'll dig around and see if I still have them.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>That's a damned good idea. I'm going to add that now and see if I can get it to match the theoretical DPS. You'll still run into issues with Multi-Shot and Arcane Shot Cooldowns if you haven't taken them into account for your "finishing" shot, but that becomes user error then.<br>
<br>
Doing that and using a Auto/Steady rotation gets my DPS calculated to 922.14 vs. Lactose's 921.88. I think 0.03% difference is pretty negligable. I'm going to look into tweaking the code that builds the priority rotation to try and find Steady Shot patterns between Multi and Arcane, maybe I can have it stop early when it has completed a cycle.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Norwest, I think you may be complicating it a bit more than you need to. [later - but after working through the numbers, maybe not.]<br>
<br>
Rather than solve for the uptime, lets solve for the chance on any on shot that you are <b>not</b> in Quick Shots.<br>
<br>
To do this you need to figure out how many shots have happened that you know it hasn't proc'd. This would be floor(12/quick speed), quick speed for a 2.8s weapon with quiver and SS is 1.76, so 6 shots.<br>
<br>
Then we know that the chance all of those 6 shots did not proc Quick Shots is (1-chance for QS)^(shots), or .9^6 = 53.14%. That means there is 46.86% chance that one of those 6 proc'd Quick Shots. This chance is true for any shot S in an infinite series of shots. So we can generalize the up time to 46.86%<br>
<br>
Using a 2.7s weapon like in your spreadsheet yields an uptime of 1 - (.9)^floor(12/(2.7/(1.15 * 1.3 * 1.2))) = 52.17% uptime.<br>
<br>
The only difference is that you are trying to account for the fact that for some weapons there is a difference in the number of shots that can fit into the 12 second window when it is Quick and when it is normal. I think we can account for this by averaging the two values, which while not exact is pretty easy to do. Doing this for a 2.7s weapon yields 49.58%, about 2% off from your calculations. This methodology fails in assuming half the time QS won't be up before our shot and 1/2 the time it will be, when in truth it's the same ratio as QS itself.<br>
<br>
In the interests of accuracy we should try using your calculations, but they make an assumption too, they assume there is 0 auto shot clipping in the shot rotation. We can account for this by using the Shot Rotations matrix to compute autoshots/second, which works even if there is clipping.<br>
<br>
This is very interesting, and good work on your part. I'm going to think about this a bit more, but so far I think your procedure is superior to what I am using now. (Maybe it's worth looking at Frenzy the same way.)<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">For each individual shot, iAotH is either on or off, so I tried thinking about the problem shot-by-shot instead of per-second.   What I did was calculate the average number of shots a proc lasts, counting reprocs and everything.  I also calculated the number a shots a 'no-proc' streak lasts.<br>
<br>
If we know the average number of shots in a proc chain and the average number of shots between procs we can easily find the average number of hastened shots.<br>
<br>
<b>No-proc Streak:</b><br>
Pretty simple, Hawk has a 1 / 10 chance to proc, the average length of a 'no-proc' streak is 10 slow shots.  The fact that Quick Shots doesn't add haste to the shot it procs off of is accounted for.<br>
<br>
<b>Proc-Streak</b><br>
The length of a chain of procs is a bit harder to model.  But it can be done by calculating the number of fast shots inside a proc, and calculating the chance that one of those shots will chain the proc a second/third/fourth time.  Each extra chained proc adds (on average) half of the duration of the proc. I modelled up to 15 procs in a row.<br>
<br>
One small twist, is that the first shot is not hastened when iAotH procs.  That makes 1st time procs and chained procs behave slightly differently depending on the bow speed.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
After modelling it, I recalculated the probabilities using a Taylor Series and got the same answer.  If you don't know what that is, don't worry, because, I don't really know either I just know it works.<br>

</div>I've played around with both, but ultimately decided to create my own based on your formulas. <br>
<br>
I've primarily used Cheeky's - not only because it was easier to "steal" formulas from, but I liked the way that everything was laid out so that you could see the "guts" of how various changes in gear would affect different variables of your play. I've been going with simple rotations, so the ability to model a more complex rotation is a non-factor for myself, but that's also a great tool (though I think I would have gone with a time cut-off rather than an arbitrary number of shots). I also liked how easy it was to compare various talent setups.<br>
<br>
Overall, I think both are great tools, but what I found lacking in both was an easy way to compare multiple pieces of gear to determine how much of an upgrade various options are. Lactose's allows a small comparison sample, whereas it's very cumbersome with Cheeky's as you have to write down the DPS values for each individual piece of gear if you want to compare them. This is actually why I created my own, which lists a fair number of potential upgrades, then calculates the resulting change in DPS for each one so that I can prioritize which pieces of gear to go after. I didn't bother putting in a lot of options relating to talent setup or rotations, so it's a lot simpler for me to do, but it filled the need of being able to compare multiple options at a glance.<br>
<br>
So basically, I think both are great tools, but since they didn't quite fit my own personal needs, I ended up crafting my own. But I couldn't have done it without the guidance of both of your great spreadsheets.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I'd like to come back to this idea. I've thought about it more, and I like it a lot. Has anyone found any flaw in the reasoning or math behind it. I've added it into my spreadsheet (to go along with the new Quick Shots rotation and DPS ratio idea.) It's kind of difficult to describe some of the terms easily, but I don't think that's a big deal. I'm much more interested in accuracy of information.<br>

		<div id="post_message_348955"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I understand it conceptually, I haven't gone through the math to check for errors. Conceptually it makes sense to me, but calculating the length of a streak that falls within a proc is a little tricky. The obvious way to do that would be to calculate the chance of NOT getting a proc in a streak for an arbitrarily long string of attacks. However, the time issue makes this tricky. You have to figure out if and by how much the time under effect from procs overlaps.<br>
<br>
From the start of the first buff you'll have a 1-0.10^(floor(12/attack speed)) to refresh the buff. As getting a new buff overwrites the old one with a fresh duration, the likelihood of getting a string of new buffs that are contiguous would be [1-0.10^(floor(12/attack speed))]^n, where n would be the nth buff in the string. This can be made into a sequence like<br>
<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px">
	<div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom:0px"><img src="assets/code_html.gif" border="0"></div>
	<pre class="alt2" dir="ltr" style="
		margin: 0px;
		padding: 3px;
		border: 1px inset;
		width: 694px;
		height: 34px;
		text-align: left;
		overflow: auto">n=1...infinite [1-0.10^(floor(12/attack speed))]^n</pre>
</div>This assumes that if you proc on the last shot of the buff the buffs would be overlap enough to be continuous, but this is not TOO unrealistic.<br>
<br>
The problem I'm having, and I think Norwest addresses it better than I do, is determining how many shots fall within a string of hasted shots. I'm having a fair amount of difficulty digging through the spreadsheet (norwest's, that is) because things just aren't labeled in a fashion in which I can make sense. There's a column labeled "chance of ending quick shots" in which the probability has a limit of 0 as the number of extra procs gets higher. I assume he means this is the likelihood of getting a second proc during the duration of QS and how this effects the extension of the time under effect, but it's unclear to me from the spreadsheet.<br>
<br>
So, here's my request: can you (or someone who understands your work) more clearly articulate what you're doing? I can sort of see the direction, but the spreadsheet really isn't aiding me in understanding your model. The Taylor Series you have (by the by, I'm not sure it's actually a Taylor Series, but rather just a series (correct me if I'm wrong). Purely a terminology thing, but precision in terminology will help in this conversation) looks to be, from cell b18,<br>

</div>Can you explain from whence this comes? I know it's Monday, but I'm having a hard time figuring out how you derived that equation for the series. Understanding where this is coming from would really aid me in participating in this discussion (maybe I'm the only one who's not following your math, but could you humor me?).<br>
<br>
As for the uptime calculation itself, it looks like it's the number of shots from a single proc plus the product of the probability of a second proc and the number of shots from a second proc is being used as the average length of a proc streak. You're dividing this by the sum of the length of a no-proc streak and the average length of a proc streak (that is, you're determining what percentage of the aggregate of your shots are in a proc streak). This stuff all makes sense to me (everything in this paragraph).<br>
<br>
Anyway, having someone clearly articulate what the rationale behind each step would be great, I'm just not able to follow it from the spreadsheet.<br>
<br>
Also, a nitpick: you use roundup for determining reproc chance rather than rounddown. Either is valid, however I'm inclined to use rounddown as a more conservative estimate. I changed it in my copy of the spreadsheet, but this is incredibly minor.<br>

</div>He subtracts it, because that shot doesn't (for initial proc) get hasted. So it has a different timing to it that the hasted shots (and hence, isn't simply a division operation.) So you have number of shots S = (12 - unhasted shot)/(Hasted Shot Speed) + 1. He just seems to use the Roundup() function to add 1 back in.

He carrys the same forumla through on the re-proc case, but I don't think he needs to.<br>

You add the one back in because it is still a shot firing, and when it shoots and lands it has the same 10% chance to proc Quick Shots again.<br>

</div>Right, I noticed that when he determines the number of shots in the second effect duration he's still timing the first shot as though it weren't hasted, which, as far as I can tell, is unnecessary. If you're assuming that the two effects overlap, the shot that procs the second effect has to be hasted by necessity.<br>
<br>
Again, apparently today is not my day when it comes to math or theory, so I may just be missing the need to account for the shot in boundary cases.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_349069"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Cheeky, please feel free to use my calculations, that's why I wrote them.  I did notice one thing, the +Haste leg and hand enchants may be in accurate, since it is 10.5 haste rating for 1% I believe.  The haste enchants are interesting with iAotH since depending on bow speed you can bump yourself to fitting in an extra shot with an iAotH proc.<br>

				There's a column labeled "chance of ending quick shots" in which the probability has a limit of 0 as the number of extra procs gets higher.  I assume he means this is the likelihood of getting a second proc during the duration of QS and how this effects the extension of the time under effect, but it's unclear to me from the spreadsheet.
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>Ok. What that column is, is the chance of ending the proc streak after 'X' chained procs.  The value of 6.10% on 3 procs means there is a 6.10% chance of QS ending after a chain of 3 extra procs.  <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The reason I add that shot back in, is because when iAotH expires right after a shot, the full shot gets the effect of the QS.  The 'extra shot' is the ending shot.<br>
<br>
I just realised that I don't like my 'fshots in proc (2nd + proc)' formula.  I subtracted 1 shot from the formula because the first shot is technically getting its haste from the previous proc.  But when I look at the 'Extra Duration' column I've counted the extra 7 shots starting in the middle of the last proc.  Cell E32 is not correct, if you write out the timing the average haste length is 10.5 shots not 9.5.<br>
<br>
(It's the damn boundary conditions that are messing me up).<br>
<br>
It's a fairly easy fix, but I need to go over my shot timing again and do the timing manually for a few cases.<br>
<br>
Thanks all for the feedback and checking my math.  feel free to ask me for explanations on fields etc, I know my math is confusing even to me sometimes.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_350004"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I derived the series when I only had one re-proc chance because I wasn't considering the different timing on the first/second shots.  I was just screwing with the old formulae and I found that what I have now seems to work.  I wish I could be more helpful than that and produce some genius mathematic proof.  I tend to model something, then reverse engineer a formula and test it.<br>
<br>
<br>
I've been taking another look at my boundary conditions, and I made a few errors.  I missed a fast shot every 2nd, 3rd, 4th etc proc so the series calculation is wrong anyways. <br>
<br>
Here's my new math, the length of the second proc is:<br>
(First proc length + 1 bonus hastened shot) / 2 + Chain proc length<br>
<br>
The / 2 is because the first proc is cut in half by the second, the bonus shot is to account for the 1 shot delay in iAotH.  (Now that I look at it again, the bonus shot is needed because the chain procs have 7 chances to refresh Hawk, but last for 8 autoshots.  I subtracted the first shot for the purpose of calculating reprocs, but I have to add it back in)<br>
<br>
<br>
Each additional proc past 2 will cut off an average of 1/2 of the last proc.  So each chain proc adds on average half it's length.<br>
Last Chain Length + (Chain proc length + 1 bonus hastened shot)  / 2<br>
<br>
I've checked these formulae for 2.6,2.7,2.8 speeds and they math the numbers I get when I count every case with individual shots.<br>
<br>

</div>Strictly speaking, you DO have the same chance to hit on the 7th hit as the 2nd hit. The difference you're referring to is "What is the chance that I will get 7 non-procs consecutively" versus "What is the chance the I will get 2 non-procs consecutively". The probability of each independent event is the same, the probability of consecutive events is different.<br>
<br>
I haven't hashed it all out yet, but my feelings are that you'd have to ask "what is the probability that I haven't YET had a proc in a series of shots?" and "what is the probability that this shot will be a proc?". The second question is easy to answer (10% proc chance) whereas the first appears simple, but is actually complex when you consider whether or not you're within the duration of a prior proc. I don't have good answers, but just a little insight.<br>
<br>
As for the number of shots in a proc, I think you're on the right track. The first proc will lose time equal to the unmodified attack speed before the first auto shot, which you've accounted for. The subsequent procs, if overlapping such that the effects are contiguous, won't lose the first shot.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Yeah Glau, as I said before I think simulating it is probably the easiest method to do this (which you've already done). It is an interesting academic question, though, so if someone is able to decipher things and create a nice little equation or set of equations, I'll happily support that effort.<br>
<br>
Getting back to the original question of "how do we model iAotH?", I want to reiterate my support for determining average up time and then weighting a QS and non-QS rotation accordingly. It won't be perfectly accurate, but it'll be more representative of the potential alterations required to the shot rotation while QS is up.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

The flaw in the simulation is that the proc gives you a whole number of shots gained (non continuous), the simulation is continuous.  This non-continuous nature of the proc (in relation to weapon speed) is part of what makes it difficult.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>1 - Orc base stats fixed!<br>
2 - Dive cost fixed!<br>
3 - The new way I model IAotH (upcoming version)  allows for the Hunter to build 2 shot rotations. One in normal speed, and one with quick shots. It then ratios DPS, MPS, and shots per second between the 2 based on IAotH uptime. This should meet your needs. One way to remove Quick Shots in the current released version is to turn Aspect to Viper and then hand-code in +155 RAP on the gear page.<br>
4 - Orc racial to pet damage added!<br>

I made the corrections to the average number of shots added by a re-proc.  I did that by calculating the relative probabilities each shot will re-proc, then assumed that one of the shots DID proc.<br>

I'm fairly confident of my numbers.  Compared to Glauron's numbers they are a bit high though.  I blame this on the fact that final shots in the rotation extend the bonus of iAotH past 12sec.  Without knowing Glauron's calculations I can't really say.<br>

</div>Thanks Norwest. I'll look over these equations and move them to my spreadsheet. By separating out the 2 rotations like I did I can compute autoshots/second for both rotations. This will include clipping, so we get an accurate pricture of how frequently auto shots will be fired, rather than relying on the base weapon speed and static haste.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Ok, I've looked this over and I have a few areas I need help understanding. In cell B15, what is this equation trying to do, and where do you derive it from? Also I'm at complete loss to understand what C17 is doing too. <br>
<br>
In cell B9 - where you are calculating the number of shots in the re-proc of Quick Shots you subtract off the time of a hasted shot, then divide what is left by the hasted speed and round up. Wouldn't you get the same result by just dividing by the hasted speed and taking the floor?<br>
<br>
Ex. 12 seconds and 2.5 hasted speed - Original equation = roundup((12 - 2.5)/2.5) vs. new = floor(12/2.5). Both yield a result of 4. Doing the same thing on a boundary condition, a hasted speed of 2 works the same: Original = roundup((12-2)/2) vs. new = floor(12/2). Both yield 6.<br>
<br>
I am not saying any of your numbers are wrong. I just don't understand your math enough to know if they are right. <!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_353043"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I've tried to compare lactose's and cheeky's spreadsheets because I felt if they came up with close to the same results that would be a good thing . I had to add a few things into lactose's spreadsheet, such as blessing of kings buff and the value of +hit rating compared to other stats. <br>
<br>
Basically what I found is everything seems to be about the same, except the value of +rating. With my gear and buffs, lactose's sheet showed 1 +hit to be worth about 2.15 ap, while cheeky's showed 1 +hit to be worth almost 3 ap. This is a pretty big difference, especially considering that everything else,(in terms of comparing stat choices), seemed to be almost identical between the 2 sheets. Now since I had to manual add this into lactose's spreadsheet, I could have made a mistake, but I don't think that's the case. I was thinking it could be how each spreadsheet handles the "roll" system differently for crits/hits/misses, etc. I'm definately not an expert on this, so maybe someone else has some insight on it.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Ok, I've looked this over and I have a few areas I need help understanding. In cell B15, what is this equation trying to do, and where do you derive it from? Also I'm at complete loss to understand what C17 is doing too. </div>

</div>The difficulty of modeling iAotH is that when you chain procs the last one gets overwritten.  The question becomes: how many shots did the first proc get off before it was overwritten? That's what B15/B16 is.  I previously had that number as half the length of the 1st proc, since I assumed the 2nd would on average proc halfway through the 1st.  But in reality, it procs slightly earlier. The calculations are on the 'Average Shots' Sheet.<br>
<br>
C17 is the average number of Hastened shots from the first proc, until the last hastened shot.  Basically that's how long a chain of procs lasts on average.  That number is really the key to the whole calculation.<br>

</div>Expose Weakness is present (for you) if any of your shots in the last 7 seconds triggered it. You're right in that for the raid the uptime is going to be slightly higher, since for them partial shots count, but for you they don't.

</div>You can verify the gear stats on any of the updated websites (Thottbot Test, WoWHead, etc.) if you think they are wrong. Since the spreadsheet is designed to the 2.1 mechanics in sustained fights I count Hunter's Mark as a full +440 RAP (I'm assuming a raid can keep it refreshed.)<br>
<br>
Without knowing your exact gear and what buffs you added I have no idea what your stats should be, but if you are in top-of-the-line stuff and have every buff imaginable I'd say it's entirely possible to reach those numbers.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_354919"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I've talked and seen with a hunter from Forte (Kazzak/EU) on the PTR yesterday, and with the fully AGI gem'ed test gear and a Survival spec he had around 2200 RAP and 36% crit self buffed. He didn't have any enchants on the gear (except the stuff you can get from CE and Aldor), so he was missing a bit of RAP and crit here and there.<br>
<br>
So yes, with proper Kara/SSC/TK fully gemed and enchated gear, fully raid buffed and potted a Survival hunter can pretty surely hit 2600 RAP with 44% crit i think.<br>
<br>
He pushed around 1150 DPS on Dr Boom btw (including Multi-Shots, so a bit lower on single targets), which is pretty impressive imo.<br>

</div>Bloodlust Brooch is fully modeled. Just select it's ability in your shot rotation and see how it changes your DPS for the next 20 seconds. Abacus's on-use ability should also be modeled corrcetly the random chance requires the same type of information I need for Don Santos (I don't have an Abacus either, because Pathaleon hates me). For the Hourglass I need to figure out what the exact cooldown is and %chance to proc on crit. I <i>should</i> be able to model it as an average +AP with that data.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I downloaded your spreadsheet, great work, but i have some comments and questions.<br>
<br>
It seems I'm missing Imp.HM in pet data. <br>
Thing is I'm BM but leeching HM from MM hunter. <br>
<br>
<br>
Maybe you could make extra tab: Target<br>
* level - already done<br>
* mob/boss - already done<br>
* armor - already done<br>
* debuffs (Imp.HM, CoS(arcane), Arms warrior 4% debuff, gift of arthas , Hemo,...) - the hard work... but would imho be interesting insight on hunter synergy. I'm specially interested in question, what if target has dazed effect all the time (blade twisting, shield bash, concossive barrage...).<br>
<br>
Tab: Equip compare<br>
I know i can always change things in gear tab and compare. But socketing 3slot items 10x in row can be fun <br>
<br>
Something like:<br>
Item1 vs Item2<br>
*agi<br>
*ap<br>
*hit<br>
*crit<br>
<h1><a href="#top" class="nuwiki_top_link">[top]</a> Erap or dps, or change VS current gear. <br>
<br>
I don't remember or i didn't saw. Agi </h1><br>
Crit = AP conversions with final gear/talents/rotation.<br>
(something i find extremely useful in Lactoses sheet, that provides Item1 vs Item2 with next to 0 tinkering)<br>
<br>
How do you model TBW in? I always fire TBW up with Rapid Fire / Trinkets(abacus/kiss) / Troll Zerking or Bloodlust. It results in more shots fired with +10% damage modifier, and also that means pet usually has far better focus regain at that time (doing more specials at 50% boost, in case of BL with greater speed also). I'm no math expert but seems logical to me that damage should be better this way instead of giving haste and tbw some static average % increase.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I model it based on a 1.3 PPM rate, and that it applies to all shots. I have a special section for it in the Calculations tab with all the math. I then add the DPS from it into the Hunter DPS totals. I do assume a 5% crit rate. If it turns out to be based on spell crit for the Hunter I can modify that in the future.<br>

</div>I'll look into adding Improved Hunter's Mark to the pet buff listing. That shouldn't be too hard to do. I'm not sure when I'll get around to researching all the other debuffs you list and figuring out exactly how to incorporate them. But they are good ideas for future development.<br>
<br>
I <i>have</i> thought about modeling Concussive Barrage to see how often a target will be dazed by a Hunter and it's effect on his Steady Shot DPS in a long fight. But I don't know any Hunter who actually put any talent points into it. If I do a target debuff table I'll make sure to incorporate daze into it.<br>
<br>
Doing an equip compare is problematic in a presentation sense. I'll think about how I can do that in a way that makes for simple comparisons. I probably will not have the items full effects modeled into a complete DPS total. For anything with a speed differential (haste, weapon speed, etc.) it requires rebuilding a shot rotation. But just doing normal calculations requires me to double the effort made to compute DPS. While doing that isn't prohibitive, keeping both sets of equations up to date is more maintanence than I'm willing to undertake. Others have pointed out that making copies of the spreadsheet is the best way to do full equipment set compares.<br>
<br>
The same comment reagrding multipe equation sets applies to adding in Lactose's X AP = Y crit = Z Agi matrix. It's easy enough to hand code in 1 extra stat in the blue row on the Gear page and see what the benefit is.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>It's easy to do this; simply autoshot on Dr Boom for some large number of shots (5-10 minutes) with a quiver equipped, then count the number of procs by parsing the combat log. Do the same WITHOUT a quiver (ergo with a different attack speed). Divide the number of procs for each data set by the total time of each data set; they should be roughly equal. Make sure you don't have AotH/iAotH up.<br>
<br>
Edit: You can easily verify overlapping procs with this same method, just look for a proc that occurs less than the duration of the buff from the previous proc. A very easy method to verify this.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I was thinking about something else... PPM:<br>
Let's say you have a 1 PPM weapon, with a 1.0 speed (no hastes). On average, you'll see 1 proc per minute (PPM). Hastes and special attack affect how many procs you actually get. PPM is converted into a chance of proc per attack (PPA). The PPA of said example weapon would be 1/60 --&gt; ~1.67% chance of proc per attack.<br>
 <br>
With hastes and special attacks, this value stays the same, but amount of attacks increase, resulting in more procs within a set amount of time.<br>
 <br>
Saying a weapon like this is PPM based or not is actually just silly of me, since they convert to each other (and is based on original weapon speed). For enchants, which can be used on weapons with varying speeds, this is something to consider.<br>

</div>Yes, if the combat log prints on refreshing procs, which is what I'm uncertain of. A combat log check if it does <b>not</b> print on refreshing is to check whether or not you have a GAIN and FADE message with a bigger gap than the actual duration.<br>
 <br>
If it does refresh, and does not print, a large enough sample would be enough to reverse engineer the PPM rate (although probably not 100% accurately).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_360247"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->When testing the proc there is a problem. So far I used Procwatch and Procmeter, but both fail to adress selfrefresh as a new proc. I checked the combatlog, and the refresh does not get listed as a new proc in there as well.<br>
<br>
A refresh would also make the uptime of the proc more unreliable to predict I think, since it clears the 10 seconds from the proc before. One proc, and at 8 seconds before end another proc means two procs, but only 12 seconds with the buff up, and not 20.<br>
<br>
I think the only reliable way is to sit back and count the procs myself, for lets say 10 minutes. And then I can see how many shots I fired, and how many procs I had. I hope someone has a better idea <!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_360257"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->That's interesting; I am fairly confident that there is some event corresponding to gaining the buff (clearly, as there is an animation). Likewise, I'm fairly sure SCT will register when a buff refreshes; consequently, it might be worth having someone who writes proc measuring mods explore using events to count procs rather than watching the combat log (I'm not a programmer, however, so I'll leave that to the professionals).<br>
<br>
Regardless of whether combat log parsing is not the best method, it should still work. Just look for durations longer than the duration of a single buff and do ROUNDUP(duration of buff/base duration of buff) to get the number of procs during the duration of the buff. If there are overlapping buffs, clearly there is no internal cooldown. If there are, you need to count each proc in order to accurately determine whether it's PPM or flat percentage.<br>
<br>
Lactose: I realize PPM is converted to PPA based on attack speed, that was my point. You can intentionally vary the attack speed by equipping/removing a quiver. If it's PPM then the number of procs / unit time will be invariant. If it's a flat percentage then the number of procs / unit time will change based on attack speed. Not having AotH/iAotH just ensures that your attack speed will be invariant during the duration of the test.<br>
<br>
I do see your point regarding the proc linked to the weapon, but I disagree. A weapon-based proc is analogous to an enchant like Mongoose; if it's PPM then PPA is a function of attack speed. If it's a flat percentage then PPA is a constant. It still merits testing.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

the surprising thing was doing a full rotation of only stead shots and a full rotation of everything  ie arcane shots and multi yields about the same dps. the difference was like 10 dps max. <br>
<br>
is this true? does that mean if i go builts like survival i just spam steady/autos since i dont have improved multis.<br>

i messed with it for quite some time with different gear and builds. but the results were the same. Stead/auto rotation yields better or slightly lesser maybe ard 10 dps compared to full rotations.<br>

Also, note that I tend to differentiate between weapon speed and attack speed - the terminology seems to be confusing. Perhaps as a group we should adopt something of a standard - whether it's "modified weapon speed", "attack speed", or whatever.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">hi i tried the spreadsheet and was pretty surprised with the results<br>
 <br>
i tried a survival built and a marks built <br>
the surprising thing was doing a full rotation of only stead shots and a full rotation of everything ie arcane shots and multi yields about the same dps. the difference was like 10 dps max. <br>
 <br>
is this true? does that mean if i go builts like survival i just spam steady/autos since i dont have improved multis.<br>
 <br>
i messed with it for quite some time with different gear and builds. but the results were the same. Stead/auto rotation yields better or slightly lesser maybe ard 10 dps compared to full rotations.<br>

</div>Thanks for your compliments. True Shot Aura gets applied either through the buff, or the talent. If you specify the TSA talent I add it in on the Calculations page that way, and I set the Buff value to 0 on the buffs list. That is intended for BM/Survival Hunters who want to "leach" TSA from the Marks Hunter.I don't want to "double count" the benefit.<br>
<br>
Feel free to send me questions via personal message here. It keeps the thread free of clutter.</div>

		<div id="post_message_371274">I've looked through both spreadsheets and this thread but i can't find any maths which calculated the difference +to hit makes on bosses.<br>
<br>
Lactose's sheet includes to hit up to a 5% cap (so presumably 70 vs 70) but also notes that it isn't integrated correctly.<br>
<br>
I’ve got these results so far:<br>
Using Lactose’s sheets everything else at default:<br>
RAP 1800 at 0% versus 5% to hit gives:  641 vs 668 DPS  (difference of 27)<br>
RAP 1900 0/5 gives: 661 vs 689  (28)<br>
RAP 2000 0/5 gives: 680/709  (29)<br>
<br>
<br>
Basically i'm trying to convince our hunters of the import of running with the 8.6%/126 to hit rating on bosses.  But people are arguing anecdotally that they aren’t missing on bosses etc.<br>
<br>
What I’d like to calculate is actually the value of  “to hit” versus RAP.<br>
I’ve always ran under the impression it’s vital to max out to hit (probably a throw back to tranq shotting) but I’ve really no idea what it’s exact value is now.<br>
<br>
So what difference in DPS against a lvl 73 mob is there between 5% and 8.6% to hit at 2k RAP against the difference in DPS between 1900 and 2000 RAP. <br>
<br>
Is this in the sheets and I’m being a user?  <br>
Or can someone point me at some maths on this somewhere?</div>

</div><br>
If you look at the Calculations tab in my spreadsheet you can see how hit rating and mob level work together to generate a chance to hit. Against level 73 mobs with typical Defense you need 8.6% hit to not miss. And 136 (not 126) rating is needed for non-Survival Hunters to get +8.6% ranged hit.<br>
<br>
You can hand code in different levels of RAP and hit on the gear page (blue section) and see how that changes overall DPS. It is not going to be a linear relationship.<br>
<br>
Without running a tool like WWS or Recap it's very hard to tell if you miss a few shots on a long boss fight.</div>

</div>Cheeky would you mind including the dps bonus from TBW?  If it's up 18 seconds out of every 120 (15% of the time), increasing the hunter's dmg by 10% and pet's by 50%, then it is a straight 1.5% bonus to the hunter's personal dps, and 7.5% bonus to the pet's dps.

</div>Thanks Cheeky.<br>
<br>
I was being a user.  <br>
<br>
The sheet i'd downloaded before was just a list of items(?!).<br>
<br>
But i downloaded the new one and made perfect sense.<br>
I got some rough figures on base DPS at different RAP/to hit.<br>
<br>
It must of been a huge job of work so thank you very much for your efforts!<br>
I'm pointing all our hunters at the sheet to go learn!</div>

I'm not sure if one or two WWS logs is enough of a sample size to draw conclusions from.

</div>Well its in the 2.1 patch notes ^^<br>
That they reduced glancing rate. Anyway wasn't there a paladin (on this board) that hit kurinax like 100.000x to test glancings/weaponskill on PTR/Live?<br>
<br>
Edit:<br>
Gathering some data: <br>
1. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304051610/http://elitistjerks.com/364114-post14.html" target="_blank">http://elitistjerks.com/showpost.php...4&amp;postcount=14</a><br>
~25% glancing, and glancing reduces damage ~25%<br>

<br>
The logs in the weapon skill thread in the class mechanics subforum place the glancing chance at ca 20% post patch and glancing penalty still ca 24%.<br>
<br>
So neglecting crits and nonconnecting swings you are looking at<br>
<br>
pre patch white damage: 0.6*1+0.4*0.76=0.904<br>

post patch white damage: 0.8*1+0.2*0.76=0.952

This is probably in at least 1 other place on the forums, but the equation for autoshot damage is (barring misses):<br>
(((WeaponDPS + AmmoDPS + RAP/14) * WeaponBaseSpeead) + ScopeDamage) * (1 + (Crit% * CritDamageModifier * SlayingCritModifier)) * FocusedFire * RangedWeaponSpecialization * SlayingTalents<br>
<br>
Divide that by your actual autoshot speed (on character sheet) and you have DPS.</div>

For those interested, I've made a small spreadsheet that calculates your average Auto, Steady, Arcane, and Mutli Shot values with some basic input parameters.  It also calculates those values for +2AP, +1Crit Rating, +1 Agi, +1 Agi with LR, and +1 Agi with LR and BoK.  If someone wants I can add in +1 Agi with BoK.  xls link <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304051610/http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=pbPO7HEBoEyLS3ksBHeULBA&amp;output=xls" target="_blank">here</a>.<br>

 - Adjusted critical hit rating to 22.0765 points per % crit.<br>
 - Fixed Custom Item usage for melee weapons.<br>
 - Corrected items. (Belt of the Black Eagle, Mantle of the Tireless Tracker)<br>
 - Added in my initial modeling of Scorpid Poison.<br>
 - Adjusted Tauren base stats, oh and spelled their name correctly….<br>
 - Fixed a really stupid bug where Steady Shot cast times were getting an extra 100% haste effect.<br>
 - Added training points for Avoidance<br>
 - Added new gear (Necklace of the Deep). This meant adding a second gem slot to neck items.</div>

		<div id="post_message_379261">Oh, and an idea I had in the vein of valuation of stats, would be to create a tool that takes the same input as my mini-spreadsheet, and creates three curves for each shot, one that is damage by crit change starting from your current crit, one that is damage by rap change starting from your current rap, and one that is damage by rap and crit change starting from your current rap and crit (this last one would of course be a 3d graph).  Each could have a given range (I'd think based on itemization points, maybe 10 item levels worth of points or something).  It could also be extended to have a shot cycle as input and create a 3d graph for dps changes based on those two axis.<br>
<br>
The reason I think this would be useful is because the single-increment valuation is useful for a gauge, but if you add more than that increment your valuation starts losing more and more accuracy (because for each variable the valuation actually depends on that variable, savvy?).  I mean, while people dish out the idea that 14RAP = 1DPS the reality is that the RAP-DPS graph is a curve when taking fluctuating crit values into consideration (14RAP at x crit is really zDPS, but at y crit it is aDPS).  With the curves you could get a feel for relative slopes and figure out at any give point when to shift your focus for itemization.<br>
<br>
Does something like that sound useful to you guys?  I kinda think so, since it would be gear-independent and allow for a better sense of what kind of upgrades are more beneficial (instead of what specific upgrade is best buy guess and checking it in one of the inclusive spreadsheets).<br>
<br>
Update: I think I settled on the best visualization for it.  A single 3d graph with DPS, Crit %(rating?), and RAP as the axises.  It'd take the same inputs as my spreadsheet plus a shot cycle/duration and pop out the proper graph.  For spice the agi curves for each of the buff-states could be drawn on as well.  Maybe allow for the suspension of one axis (dropping it down to DPS and Crit for instance) and the isolation of the agi curves (so the axises would be DPS and agi).  Hmm...yes, I think those would be interesting.  Could a spreadsheet do that?  Or would it need to be a 3d graphing tool?</div>

</div>You're essentially asking for plane curves that lie in a plane that crosses the AP/CRIT/HIT axes at certain values. For each shot, it should be possible to determine the formula dictating damage (this is done already for pretty much all shots as it stands). If nothing else, having the partial derivatives of each of the major players (ap/crit/hit) in the equation wouldn't be too difficult. Honestly, though, given how dependent hunter dps is on the sequence of abilities rather than maximizing the individual ability, I'm not sure how much practical value this would have.</div>

</div>I don't have that diamond, was trying to account for slaying talents, but I see in the earthstorm diamond thread that slaying works differently too, so I'll probably adjust it to 2.44 (2.3 *1.03 *1.03) and drop the damage modifier down to 1.03 (I'm looking at damage with FI up also).<br>

</div>That distributes for a one roll system (crits are not hits, hits are not crits). IF it uses a two roll system (crits are hits, not all hits are crits), critical strikes are the product of hit and crit. This would look like:<br>
<br>
[(hit%-hit%*crit%)+hit%*(crit%*CritMod)]*DamageFromShot<br>
<br>
So the sum of hits and crits is equal to the hit%, which may be less than 100% of all attacks (it doesn't account for misses, but with 100% to hit it is the same as your last formula, which we would expect). Anyway, you could simplify that equation but I think that form is most demonstrative of my point. This is why I asked; again, I haven't confirmed it's a two roll special / one roll auto system yet, but that's the mathematical line of reasoning with which I approached it.</div>

		<div id="post_message_380062">There's some good info in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080228212727/http://elitistjerks.com/f40/t12667-dps_warrior_hit_hugely_overrated/#25" target="_blank">[dps Warrior] Hit is hugely overrated</a> if you want to read more. It <i>appears</i> that the consensus is that it is a 1 roll system, but I don't want to put words in mouths. Essentially, this is what the info in that thread says:<br>
<br>
* There is 1 roll to determine if something is a hit, miss, crit, glance, etc.<br>
* 1% crit has no effect on the miss %, but subtracts 1% from your chance to hit<br>
* 1% hit has no effect on the crit %, but subtracts 1% from your chance to miss<br>
<br>
Make sense? I think I have that correct. Assuming it is, the formula should be<br>
<br>
(ChanceHit+Crit%*CritModifier)*ShotDamage = TotalDamageFromShot<br>
where<br>
ChanceHit = 1 - (ChanceMiss - %Hit) - Crit%<br>
ShotDamage = whatever the shot damage formula is for the given shot<br>
<br>
So your Hit% converts miss chances to hits, and crit% converts hit chances to crits. I believe this is correct, but again, math mistakes may have been made.</div>

		<div id="post_message_380131">I think you are complicating it there.  For a 1-roll system you can just do what I'm doing and use:<br>
<br>
(Crit%*CritMod)*Damge + (Hit%-Crit%)*Damage<br>
<br>
What this does is for your %crit multiplies the damage by the crit mod, then it takes and subtracts out your crits from your total hits and multiplies that % by shot damage.  Or if you reverse the order maybe it would make more sense:<br>
<br>
(Hit%-Crit%)*Damage + (Crit%*CritMod)*Damge<br>
<br>
So it's how many hits will I get that are not crits, and then how many crits will I get.  If you add up (Hit%-Crit%) and Crit% you of course get Hit%, and if you subtract that from 100% you get your miss%, which is in line with a 1-roll system.</div>

(with a level 73 boss, this time with 0 armor)<br>
Sunfury Bow of the Phoenix - Hunter DPS (no pet) 1143.70  (weapon speed 2.90, dps 83.3)<br>
Wrathfire Hand Cannon - Hunter DPS (no pet) 1156.57  (weapon speed 2.00, dps 64.5)<br>
Wolfslayer Sniper Rifle - Hunter DPS (no pet) 1175.39  (weapon speed 2.70, dps 79.1)<br>

The Sunfury Bow has the highest dps of those 3 weapons, but it's also the slowest.  Dunno if it's still acting funny or not, but I wouldn't think that the dwarf racial bonus to guns would make the Wrathfire gun do more damage than the Sunfury bow.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Thanks for the reply Cheeky!  I was/am using version 19 and getting the same results:<br>
(with a level 73 boss, this time with 0 armor)<br>
Sunfury Bow of the Phoenix - Hunter DPS (no pet) 1143.70  (weapon speed 2.90, dps 83.3)<br>
Wrathfire Hand Cannon - Hunter DPS (no pet) 1156.57  (weapon speed 2.00, dps 64.5)<br>
Wolfslayer Sniper Rifle - Hunter DPS (no pet) 1175.39  (weapon speed 2.70, dps 79.1)<br>
<br>
The Sunfury Bow has the highest dps of those 3 weapons, but it's also the slowest.  Dunno if it's still acting funny or not, but I wouldn't think that the dwarf racial bonus to guns would make the Wrathfire gun do more damage than the Sunfury bow.</div>

</div>Try plugging in a non-0 value for lag on the Shot Rotation. I can see the Wolfslayer being a bit better theoretically than the Sunfury. You loose just 11.76 damage from the Steady Shot, but gain a 6.9% greater frequency on Steady Shots. Once your Steady Shot damage is higher than 170 (so, all of us) your going to do more Steady Shot DPS with the Wolfslayer.<br>
<br>
Hmm, thinking about this more, if you have no haste effects besides quiver you <i>could</i> achieve a 1.8s cycle with the wrathfire, so your steady shot damage is 52.64 less per shot, but you are getting them at a 31.03% increased rate. The damage cut off is again, ~170 for the Wrathfire to be higher Steady Shot DPS.<br>
<br>
If you can get your Steady Shot DPS high enough with the faster weapons it can overcome the autoshot DPS difference (just ~20 between the Wrathfire and Sunfury.) I'm sure we could derive the point this happens for any 2 weapon's speed and DPS values. Of course to do this you are going to bleed mana out of your ass.</div>

		<div id="post_message_380586">Ahh, with even 20ms latency, both the Sunfury and the Wolfslayer stay at their dps, but the Wrathfire drops about 16 dps.  Push the latency up to 40ms and the Wrathfire gets even worse, but the other 2 stay the same.  Good times.  I think I'll try out the Wolfslayer tonight and see how it works  =)<br>
<br>
Also, I noticed that you didn't have a damage listed for an Owl's screech ability.  The highest is Rank 5 and it does 33-61 physical damage (according to wowhead) and costs 20 focus.  I tend to use an owl for raids due to the AP debuff.  I hear there's a cap to how much you can debuff a boss, although I don't know what it is.</div>

</div>when using my scorpid, I found it had a hard time maintaining the all-important debuff when any other dps ability was set to autocast (namely claw).

		<div id="post_message_382736">I just recently found the EJ site -- wow, great stuff.  I feel like Tarzan seeing fellow humans for the first time and realizing that I'm not just a funny looking ape.<br>
<br>
I've been solo theorycrafting for a while and have developed an equipment evaluation spreadsheet that  focuses on accounting for effects of individual variability in shot cycle.  Before I risk wasting anyone's time on what may or may not be a contribution here, I want to check my understanding of a few things, esp. haste effects.  Apologies if this isn't the place to ask (the topic seems to come up in many places) or if this info has been covered (though I've read through hundreds of posts + wowwiki articles without managing to figure it out...).<br>
<br>
Specifically:<br>
<br>
1) Which cast-time/cooldowns of which shots are affected by haste effects (esp. the big 3: quiver, SS, IAotH)?  Here's my current, probably flawed understanding:<br>
<br>
auto cast (.5 sec): no<br>
auto CD (wpn speed): yes<br>
steady cast (1.5 sec): yes<br>
steady CD (0): n/a<br>
arcance cast (0): n/a<br>
arcane CD (GCD=1.5 sec): no<br>
multi cast (.5 sec): no<br>
multi CD (10 sec): no<br>
<br>
2) Is damage per shot from AP haste-adjusted for any shot type other than autoshot?  <br>
<br>
In case the question isn't clear, I know damage/shot is reduced by increased haste to keep AP DPS contribution constant (14 AP / 1 DPS before adjustments).  Does haste cause similar reductions for any other shot type?<br>
<br>
<br>
And while I'm at it, a couple even more noobish questions...<br>
<br>
3) Does miss rate increase at exactly 1.2% per level above self?  (so 5% at even level, 8.6% at +3 levels)  I saw something on wowwiki indicating that the increase is discontinuous.<br>
<br>
4) What's the formula for increased crit% from agility?  I know it's 1% per 33 at level 60 and 1%/40 at 70.  Perhaps it's a constant 1/33 up to 60, then linear after that?<br>
<br>
Thanks!</div>

</div>1 - You have them correct.<br>
<br>
2 - Haste has nothing to do with damage for special shots, just the cast speed of some of them. And the bonus damage to Multi-Shot, Aimed Shot and Auto Shot are <b>not</b> scaled down based on haste. RAP and Ammo gains are based off the weapon base speed alone.<br>
<br>
3. Pretty much. It's actually 0.04% per point differential in Weapon Skill vs. Defense, and 1% per level difference.<br>
<br>
4. It varies for every level. I had the ratios for levels 61-69 at one point, but I threw them away when I hit 70. And it was not a linear rate of progression.</div>

		<div id="post_message_383575">Hey guys, I've been using this spreadsheet for some time and its quite amazing, with its help i did maximize my dmg .<br>
     <br>
But i think that u calculate scorpid poison wrong for version 19, since +dmg to dots is calculated as : <div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px">
	<div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom:0px"><img src="assets/code_html.gif" border="0"></div>
	<pre class="alt2" dir="ltr" style="
		margin: 0px;
		padding: 3px;
		border: 1px inset;
		width: 694px;
		height: 34px;
		text-align: left;
		overflow: auto">(spelldmg)*(duration of dot)/15</pre>
</div> meaning that not all spelldmg is added to it, only a portion of it. Scorpid poison Rank 4 gains 66.6% of spelldmg and rank 5 gains 53.3% of it.<br>
     <br>
I did some calculations and testing on my char and im sure this is corect. With this new formula scorpid is still the most superior pet in terms of dmg, but not as much as the spreadsheet calculates.<br>
<br>
P.S. I used formulas from: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080115232044/http://www.wowwiki.com/Formulas:Plus_damage_and_Plus_healing" target="_blank">http://www.wowwiki.com/Formulas:Plus...d_Plus_healing</a></div>

</div>Could very well be. It might also speed up the frequency of Kill Command usage to make the difference too. Without knowing all the details of your spec and gear I can't say which reason is the dominating one, but if you look at the Pet calculations tab you should be able to figure it out.</div>

</div>Well, what I can do for now is, have everything done and ready, write down my own dps and the one of the pet separately, then give me a custom ring which has 500RAP above the real ring, and then I see how the pet dps is changed through the ~100AP it got from scaling.

</div>Maybe you are right at the point where 2 AP and 1 Agility are "balanced". Then if you add too much Agility you find AP would be better.<br>
<br>
I can't imagine the spreadsheet is showing much difference between Agility and AP in either case. Anything less than 1 DPS could be the result of rounding errors.</div>

First the bug report. When I apply abacus of violent odds in my shot rotation it breaks the damage totals from that point on in the rotation.<br>

If i set up a normal priority rotation with just Multi and Steady it lists my total dps as 1609.93dps. If i set up the same rotation but use Multi and Arcane it lists my total dps as 1558.94. Obviously the difference in mitigation types (arcane resist/armor) would change these numbers. Will you be adding the ability to factor in the differences in damage mitigation any time soon?</div>

</div>Thanks for the bug report. I tracked it to a column problem in the Trinket database. Next version will have this fixed.<br>
<br>
Arcane resist is a mechanic I don't have enough information to model. Right now I assume no resists at all. For armor, you can set the target's armor value on the gear page. All physical damage takes the armor into account.</div>

</div>Ive tried that as well, and even downloaded it a third time, and selected, reselected it.<br>
Still the windrunner stats, ive added them as custom (very neat function), so no biggie.<br>
And since i seem to be the only one with this porblem, ill leave it at that.<br>
Cheers for the replys though, appreciated.</div>

		<div id="post_message_403197">I have created another Hunter spreadsheet with a smaller scope.  It calculates average noncrit and crit damage for ranged attacks, then provides a 'shot average.'  Shot average being the result of weighting crit, hit, and miss rate.<br>

The effects of Haste and shot rotation in general are purposefully left out.  My goal was to provide a lightweight alternative, accurate within its limits.  I also find the act of creating a class spreadsheet personally educational.<br>

</div>Try the Blasted Lands mob and see if you miss at all. If you are still seeing a 3.65% miss rate then there is definitely something screwy going on with hit%. (Even the miss rate you are seeing seems too high.)<br>
<br>
I would assume a Troll would have a 1.4% miss rate (at 0.24% skill vs. defense), or a 2.4% miss rate (1% per level difference, 0.04% per skill vs. defense) using a bow against Dr. Boom.<br>
<br>
My numbers have not been verified by me personally. I plan to do so tomorrow, doing the same sort of tests you are. Using both a bow and a gun I'm hoping so see either a 1.2% or 0.2% difference. I figure 4K shots a piece should be enough of a sample size.</div>

First of all, thanks! I love this spreadsheet.<br>
<br>
I noticed that you don't have sockets included for the TwinBlade of the Phoenix. It should have 1 red, 1 yellow, and 1 blue.<br>
<br>
Concerning sockets - would it be possible to include a gem tally on the gear tab that shows how many of each color you currently have? This would be very useful in seeing where we are in meeting our metagem requirements, especially when you factor in multi-color gems.</div>

</div>Ok, with 3915 shots (forgot to turn on logging first 85) I got the following with 0 hit rating, and no surefooted. This was against Dr. Boom with a 350 weapon skill (gun):<br>
3170 Hits - 80.97%<br>
596 crits - 15.22%<br>
149 misses - 3.81% miss<br>
<br>
This means +10 weapon skill vs. Dr. Boom's assumed 340 Defense is good for +1.2% hit.<br>
<br>
I am testing now with a bow (have to raise weapon skill from 335 to 355 first) and around 3K shots.<br>
<br>
I think the numbers Khanate and I are getting are enough to handle any sample size concerns. Not sure if Dr. Boom has a higher than average defense either, since my crit rate on the paper doll is 15.36% and I would assume the weapon skill difference should have made it 15.76%.<br>
<br>
Once I get bow data we can see if the +5 weapon skill difference had any effect. I will update this post when I get the second data set.<br>
<br>
Update:<br>
After leveling my bow skill, I managed to get the following results:<br>
2717 hits - 79.96%<br>
570 crits - 16.77%<br>
111 misses - 3.27%<br>
<br>
So getting +5 more weapon skill worked out to +0.54% gain. This is completely out of line with previous numbers seen, before the 2.0 patch. It seems to be very close to the .12% per point of weapon skill with the gun test above.<br>
<br>
Another difference is in crit rate. The paperdoll rate for the bow I was using was 16.20%. I saw a good deal higher value at 16.77%. The difference in the gun and bow tests, factoring out paperdoll was 0.71% with 5 more weapon skill.<br>
<br>
I wonder if even these exhaustive tests are still going to have issues with sample size. I don't know enough statistics to derive the confidence for these numbers based on rates seen and number of shots.<br>
<br>
I am re-running 4K more shots with a gun to test Don Santos proc rates, but I'll record the data for crit/miss here as well.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Edit: I appear to have a small bug with my crit rating in the spreadsheet as well. The sheet accurately (minus the 3 agility error on base stats) lists my crit bonus from agility and my 201 crit rating, but is calculating my crit at 22.77%, wheras my in-game character sheet is at 23.30%.</div>

</div>Did you adjust the target to be level 70? I usually save the sheet with the target being level 73. That makes a 0.6% difference in crit rating.<br>
<br>
For everyone who sees a derived stat incorrect, please look at the Calculations tab and see exactly where the error is, in base agility, crit from gear, talents, or level/weapon skill adjustments.</div>

		<div id="post_message_417054">Cheeky:  To repeat what Seipher said, why is the spreadsheet password protected on unlocking the cells?  Rather frustrating particularly since for some reason you've got Hunter's Mark down as 440 attack power in the calculations sheet when it's only 110?<br>
Please can you post the password so this thing can be played with a bit more properly.  I'm trying to add a sheet that will allow me to calculate how much mp5 I need for X maxdps shooting time (most commonly 10mins as most fights last 10mins).</div>

		<div id="post_message_417112">Just a quick comment:<br>
Hunter's Mark <b>starts</b> at 110 RAP, but stacks to 440 RAP (+11 RAP per ranged attack against target, 30 shots to max it out). Refreshing the buff keeps the stack, making the average RAP gain from it ~440 RAP (closer and closer as fight duration increases).<br>
<br>
Although my memory might be deceiving me, I also seem to remember Cheeky commenting on the password stuff earlier - somewhere along the lines of wanting to both gain knowledge (if something is wrong, he'll know about it when he's fixing it), and to ensure that the spreadsheet is kept up-to-date. If everyone were to correct minor stuff locally, this would be harder.</div>

		<div id="post_message_417202">That's cool.  I can understand the reasoning for the password and so I'll try to add to the functionality of the spreadsheet by saying what I'm trying to get out of it:<br>
<br>
1) Crit vs Ap - the great armor choice discussion<br>
It would be EXTREMELY useful to any hunter who's looking through his gear to be able to just very simply check how much attackpower is 1% crit worth given his current stats.  I mean...I know that you can mess around with your gear in the gear sheet (lovely work there by the way), but that's a bit too fiddly for someone who's just browsing items.  Also, for people like me who use AEPmod it's very handy to be able to numerically convert the value of crit into ap based on the stat's effect on final dps output.  We all know that the more ap you get the more 1% crit is worth, I would just love to see this in a "With your current gear, another 1% Crit is worth X AP" equation.<br>
<br>
2) Mp5 - what do I need??<br>
This is more of a personal interest I don't know how many people do this.  I've noticed you've built a rather nice part into the Shot Rotation part of the spreadsheet which breaks down your mana useage and time-to-oom etc.  The only thing is, it doesn't account for mana pots (or more accurately, for me, Fel Mana pots).  Fel Mana pots are 133mp5 +/- for example.  After playing around with some figures I managed to work out that in 10mins of spamming the rotation calculated in the Shot Rotation sheet I would still need around 100 extra mp5.  Basically, it would be nice to have a table where you could work out how much mp5 you would need in a fight with X seconds, with X pot, +/- Viper aspect etc etc.<br>
<br>
3) Serpent Sting<br>
I know serpent sting is a bit crap and all that but I do have an elemental dps shammy in my raid who likes to keep his debuff up which does make serpent sting a worthwhile cast instead of a steady shot somewhere in the rotation.  Would be nice to be able to factor it into the calculations.<br>
<br>
The password would however still be useful for being able to manual play with the numbers here and there.</div>

</div>I will take your ideas under consideration, but realize that somethings which sound easy (such as Ap/crit ratios) are actually a fuckton of work to implement. I try and add requested features as my availability to put the time in is available.<br>
<br>
1 - I most likely will not be putting in the Ap/crit calculator, because it requires my doing 3 sets of all equations. 1 for the current gear, 1 for some extra amount of AP, and 1 for some extra amount of crit. That is 3 times as much that can have a bug, and 3 times as much effort to maintain. You can always hand adjust in extra AP or crit rating on the gear page (blue cells) and see the result easily enough.<br>
<br>
2 - You can hand code in +133 mp5 on the gear page and see how that effects you time to OOM. <br>
<br>
3 - Is the Shaman buff enough to make Serpent Sting worth a GCD or the mana? I can add the shot in as a straight damage with a cooldown equal to the total time the DOT lasts easily enough. I'll try and get that into the next version. I once did some work to incorporate the "ticks" into the shot rotation, but it's not worth all the effort. Everything in the sheet assumes infinite length combat, this should too. <br>
<br>
I do not, and will not provide the password. Ever. This is my work, and I know that any versions people have are done by me. My name and a good deal of my reputation in the Hunter community is tied up in this spreadsheet. I do not what variant versions of questionable quality (no offense, but I don't know you) floating around. I have also devoted almost 1000 hours of my personal time to develop this. If my protecting the intellectual property and version control are too annoying for you, don't use it.</div>

</div>Good for you I say, bravo!<br>
<br>
It is a fantastic piece of work.  Your comments on the ap/crit ratios are good to hear.  With regards to the mp5 I'm a bit disappointed.  If you want though I can whip up a spreadsheet to show you what I meant, it's one thing to calculate how much you need of X stat to reach satisfaction level by "experimenting" by plugging in values until you reach said level, but something to reverse calculate it would complete the whole thing quite nicely I think.<br>
<br>
Serpent Sting...well it depends on how you function, at the end of the day what you are trading is the 666 dmg of serpent sting for whatever you get from a Steady shot.  However serpent sting is easier to weave into autoshots, the same way you might find an auto and multi stacked followed by a steady before the next auto, and it is extra dps.<br>
<br>
Again, it is a fantastic piece of work and I will retract my request for passwordage, only hope my comments can help you make it better </div>

</div>Just to recomment what I just wrote...<br>
<br>
It may not be worth a GCD or the mana when you have either Steady/Multi/Arcane available.  But somewhere in the rotation you will find that you get about 1sec which ticks over an Auto cast (this will happen when both Arcane and Multi are on cd) which could be more efficiently used with a serpent sting.<br>
<br>
YES it is a lot of mana but at the same time I'm trying to nuke, I'm not trying to save mana.  Can talk about mana once the maxdps equation is figured.  Also, with Stormstrike activated (a common dps shammy talent) Serpent Sting does just under 800dot.</div>

</div>It seems odd to me to hear talk about whether a shot is worth the mana or not. Mana is something that is renewable and totally replacable by the use of potions/oils. Surely if people are willing and able, to go to extroardinary amounts of effort, to simulate the potential of the hunter class, then they should be willing and able to go to that extra effort in game to maximise their potential. The best way I have found is to spec Herbalism. With minimal effort I have Fel Mana Pots by the dozen.<br>
<br>
As I read more and more about AEP and people views of how to represent it, it seems more and more obvious to me how we should be approaching things. We're a DPS class and will always be compared to the rogues/mages/locks out there. When we fire a shot, there are only five factors that determine how hard it hits. Weapon Damage, Ammo, Attack Power, Crit Rating and Hit Rating. We should also include Haste in this, as if we fire one shot, we're probably going to fire a second.<br>
<br>
If people are willing to put as much effort into providing endless mana in the way of potions (which isn't that hard), doesn't this open up a lot more potential? and allow us to solely focus on what matters the most ..... DPS?<br>
<br>
Or maybe I'm talking nonsense. I'm kinda new to all this theorycrafting business </div>

</div>I pointed out the mana efficiency as a brief summary of how horrible it is.  If you have a 1sec window over an autoshot then firing Serpent Sting is going to trigger the 1.5s GCD and delay your next special by .5s.  Given the extremely low damage of Serpent Sting I contend this will not be worthwhile.<br>
<br>
In the best case it's doing 800 damage.  On average, Stormstrike will not be up for a portion of the time and your shot may be partially (or fully) resisted.<br>
<br>
If you still think it's useful, can you give me a timing breakdown of an optimal situation. including weapon speed?</div>

</div>I think mana potion use is pretty much a given since 2.0.  I agree with you that it's important, but I don't think serious DPS hunters are ignoring it by making spreadsheets <br>
<br>
Also, proactively using Fel Mana potions does not supply one with "endless mana".  3200 mana / 120 sec cooldown = 133 mp5, or 26.6 mana per second.  I usually use much, much more than 26.6 mana per second.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I'd be more concerned about what you're replacing in order to fire Serpent Sting. For Beast Master Hunters, you'll probably more often than not have better / more damaging abilitites at your disposal, while Marksman / Survival Hunters might have some time now and again to throw it up there, due to having more 'dead time' between shots.</div>

	</tbody></table>
</div>With SV spec and 2.9 bow I have time for extras. Next Serpent Spine Bow is mine so even "more" slack time inc. <br>
<br>
I use those free times for mark / mend / pot / scorpid sting if possible. Largely depends on lag that night and situation of course. <br>
<br>
auto<br>
steady+multi<br>
auto<br>
steady<br>
auto<br>
steady+arcane<br>
auto<br>
steady<br>
auto<br>
steady+free<br>
auto<br>
<br>
This is kinda idea behind my rotation and would produce 11shots/10seconds if perfect while in reality its more like 10/10 or 9/10 looking at my WWS logs.<br>
<br>
At time of that steady+free you get MS cooled down but sometimes not quite yet and its safer to do something else. Next combo (after +free) would indicate steady+multi but at same time you have arcane cooled down and you just had "specials duo" so its safer to go for arcane... chaos rotation  (explained later)<br>
<br>
There are 2 steady shots in upper model without special there in and they act as GDC dampener after dual specials, only thing I can imagine putting there is KC witch I intend to try.<br>
<br>
Fubar rotation (to show why no dual specials):<br>
<br>
0.0 Auto<br>
0.2 Steady Cast (0.2 lag)<br>
1.5 Steady Fire<br>
1.9 Multi Cast (0.2 lag and 1.5 GDC starts)<br>
2.5 Multi Fired (0.5 auto cast begins)<br>
3.0 Auto<br>
*0.4 of GDC transfers in next part<br>
<br>
Results in: (starting each part with 0.0 for easier comparison)<br>
0.0 Auto (or 3.0 if you wish)<br>
0.6 Steady Cast<br>
1.9 Steady Fire<br>
2.3 Specaial (serpent, arcane, scorpid)<br>
2.8 Auto<br>
*1.0 GDC transfers in next part = bad<br>
<br>
Result: (steady+multi here would be disaster)<br>
0.0 Auto (or 5.8)<br>
1.2 Steady Cast<br>
2.5 Steady Fire<br>
3.0 Auto<br>
*0.0 GDC transfers in next part<br>
<br>
First batch of shots is good, second is also good but price is third that completely sux... except if you replace steady with instant (serpent/scorpid/arcane) witch I sometimes do because of poor GDC management and auto fires at 2.54 then with clear GDC on next batch where you have "Steady+free" time till CDs come up again. <br>
- This is one part where its possible to replace steady with sting.<br>
<br>
Try to avoid "steady+GDC, auto, steady+multi". With extra GDC move besides Arcane, Steady, Multi this might mean managing dual specials+GDCs with extreme precision (due CDs being ready more than you can probably handle) <br>
And because Steady+Multi takes ~2.2 seconds (0.2+1.3+0.2+0.5) and is not generous for having GDC lock on start of its auto shot from previous special. (needs clear GDC at start to work)<br>
<br>
Dead time is rare due GDCs and fast CDs, but I dare to say that with 2.9 weapon i have managed to pull 1  extra instant shot/move each ~20sec. (scorpid sting duty). Its time when i have both Arcane and Multi on "same" CD. (producing 2x auto,steady, auto in a row).<br>
- This is second part where its doable<br>
 <br>
**<br>
Can anyone please convince me going on 1:1 rotation and stack haste after entering BT? <br>
Or try and find issues/improvements in this rotation I have set up.</div>

</div>Mana considerations aside, serpent sting is a waste of the GCD 99.9% of the time.<br>
<br>
As to why we wear mail, because that is our gear niche.  If the hunter mail is designed so poorly that we would rather wear rogue leather we should be bugging designers to change it.  Jumping into other classes loot will create unnecessary drama.  It also takes any flexibility out of your group/raid setup and cuts what you can do outside of raid time.</div>

</div>Excluding the shadow priest with all of those other things it is still very possible for an SV/MM hunter to run out of mana before the end of the fight.  Maybe a resto shaman w/ tide would also be enough to push you into the "infinite" mana realm too if the timing of the tides was done right.  Regardless, using full consumables I still have to switch to viper or drop to a lower special-count rotation while waiting on mana pots on the longer boss fights.<br>

Also, for people like me who use AEPmod it's very handy to be able to numerically convert the value of crit into ap based on the stat's effect on final dps output. We all know that the more ap you get the more 1% crit is worth, I would just love to see this in a "With your current gear, another 1% Crit is worth X AP" equation.</div>

</div>I feel like this discussion is a little OT and might be better suited in another thread, but for now we can continue it here.<br>
<br>
"Proactively using Fel Mana potions" means exactly what you said.  Yes, there are many ways to increase mana regen.  It's unlikely you'll be getting mana from them all at the same time, for example:<br>
- You will rarely have both a shadow priest and shaman in group, and sometimes neither.<br>
- In a 25-person raid having more than one TotH hunter since TotH is deep Survival and having multiple Survival hunters is poor DPS compared to BM spec.<br>
- Hunters get negligable regen from Spirit and none from Int.<br>
<br>
In practice, mana is a very real issue for hunters, particularly when a shadow priest is not present.  Diligent potion usage does not make the issue disappear.<br>

</div>In many cases leather armor is better.  When you're raiding, for leather armor you need to compete with an entire class (Rogues) and in some cases an offspec (Feral Druids).  For mail armor you only need to compete with a single offspec (Enhance Shamans).  So from a distribution standpoint, Hunters need to take mail items unless they are substantially worse than leather.<br>
<br>
Also, Int does have an impact on mana for short fights and fights where you have breaks to drink.  So it is not completely useless.</div>

</div>This is the single biggest obsticle I'm finding right now. Rogues and droods still get upset when I want to need on leather drops, despite me repeatedly passing on epic mail items.<br>
<br>
For example, the two Kara gloves that we like are Gloves of Dextrous Manipulation and Gloves of Quickening. Now, any hunter with half a brain should prefer the former by a mile, but convincing a raid of that is very hard. All people see is leather=rogue loot. We're being made to settle for sub-standard gear by blizzard.<br>
<br>
I realise that I've drawn the thread OT and I'll cease the conversation there. My apologies </div>

		<!-- message -->
		<div id="post_message_425761"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Version 23 is now available for download.<br>
<br>
Here is the changelog:<br>
 - Fixed some item values (Steallaris, Merciless Gladiator's Crossbow, Pristine Fire Opal)<br>
 - Added in proc calculations for some trinkets (Hourglass of the Unraveller)<br>
 - Added in new buffs (Flask of Draenic Wisdom)<br>
 - Fixed Bracer socket bonuses for Resilience.<br>
 - Added new gear (Cowl of Defiance)<br>
 - Updated Blood Elf Racial stats. (Agility and Intellect were incorrect).<br>
 - Added Serpent Sting to the shot selection. I model this as the total damage of the sting with a cool down of 15 second. This isn't ideal, but works with the spreadsheet. If you are casting Serpent faster than once every 15 seconds (or pretty much at all) this spreadsheet isn't really going to help you.<br>
 - Separated out the +RAP gains from passive "on-proc" trinkets and items into their own section in the Calculations tab. I did this to better allow for people to compare paper doll RAP figures with the spreadsheet. I include the averaged out effects of on use +RAP gain for equipped trinkets, but only for informational purposes, they are not added into the RAP total.<br>
 - Added Scroll of Agility (level 5 only) in the buffs tab.<br>
 - Most of the sheet should work in OpenOffice now. Thanks to Paegan of TKASomething for his assistance.<br>
<br>
Next features I plan:<br>
4 piece set bonus for Beast Lord<br>
Making it easier to identify gems stats<br>
Items that effect pet stats properly accounted for (Such as <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=31328" target="_blank">[Leggings of Beast Mastery]</a>)<br>
Flags to average out on-use Trinkets<br>
Flag to average out The Beast Within for Hunter and Beastial Wrath for Pet<br>
Gear updates as I learn about them<br>
Sheet of timing information for <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28830" target="_blank">[Dragonspine Trophy]</a><!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_426891"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->First, great work Cheeky.  Your efforts are greatly appreciated.<br>
<br>
I just downloaded the newest version of your spreadsheet and there appears to be a phantom red gem, Delicate Living Ruby, somewhere in the calculations.  <br>
<br>
My crit should be 22.56%, but keeps calculating out at 22.76%.  Additionally in the gear tab, under the gem counts I show 2 red gems, but I only have one.<br>
<br>
I have gone over my inputs several times and I don't think I missed anything, right now I have just resorted to subtracting 8 agility manually.  Is this a bug, or just user error?  I am leaning towards the latter myself.<br>

Have you looked at updating for the AoV changes on the ptr currently?<br>

Is it possible to add something for Surv that lets you see the net DPS provided by EW with X number of melee in the raid. For example i was comparing my current spec with my old mm spec and found that with ideal buffs i would need 7 melee types in the raid to get equivalent dps. If i had average buffs i would need closer to 13 melee types in the raid. Now i do realize that white dps will have varying effects based on class and spec.

</div>Honestly, I have no idea how to handle the changes to Aspect of the Viper. Even if I knew what the changes in rate were, I'm not sure they are meaningful to a tool such as this spreadsheet. I think I can provide different regeneration rates, and maybe be able to compute mana longevity. We'll see if someone does the research and gets the rates, and cut-off points.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I have to agree with post #470 regarding the different weapons and the dps disparity. It is confounding to me that Wolfslayer Sniper Rifle beats out Sunfury Bow, Steam Pistol and Serpent Spine. It's not even really close. It really has me scratching my head.

</div>Please feel free to look over all the equations and see where I might be in error. I have no problem believing that a 0.2/2.9 (6.9%) increase in shot frequency can overcome 4.2/83.1 (5%) DPS difference in base weapon damage. The percentage is actually much lower when you factor in RAP, ammo, and scope.<br>
<br>
I think I mathematically proved in a thread on the TKASomething.com forums that it would take lowering your RAP to -300 or so in order to have them equal out, stats on the weapons not taken into consideration. For any hunter, eliminating dead time in your rotation is a huge difference.<br>

</div>Given that there are 2^n combinations of things that can happen, and given that dps can stop increasing over some haste regimes, perhaps you can just consider the dragonspine proc as something the user explicitly inserts into a shot rotation (with an associated cooldown related to its expected trigger frequency.)<br>
<br>
I'd do the same thing for quickshots, too -- you would have to insert that as well. But what you have there isn't broken, so it's probably easier to leave it alone.<br>

The idea is to model the damage from a particular series of events (shots selected, procs triggered) that the user chooses, and which the spreadsheet can choose to enforce with a cooldown matching the proc or shot frequency. If you take that approach, the only thing you need to model is the cooldown (don't even have to model a quickshot rotation any more -- just the quickshot's expected cooldown. This is longer with 1/5 talent and shorter with 5/5 talent, of course.)<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Yes, I saw your previous post. Updated ammo stats and the bow will be in the next version. You can set the Quick Shots rotation to anything you'd like. Feel free to make it identical to your normal shot rotation. I'd just verify that the cool downs for Arcane and Multi shot aren't forcing you to wait till the point you are missing a potential extra auto shot.<br>
<br>
Armor penetration <i>should</i> be working just fine. You can see the Effective Armor on the Calculations page. I now also support the 4-piece Beast Lord set bonus.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Adding th <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28830" target="_blank">[Dragonspine Trophy]</a> involved a fair bit more changes than any other trinket would. Don't hesitate to point out mistakes if you find them.<br>
<br>
Change Log:<br>
 - Added new gear (Quickstrider Moccasins, Cobrascale Hood, Primalstrike Belt, Primalstrike Bracers, Primalstrike Vest, Primal Intent set bonus, Black Bow of the Betrayer)<br>
 - Fixed a bug in the table that calculates effective rates of pet specials.<br>
 - Corrected gear stats (Pristine Fire Opal, Timeless Arrows, Timeless Shells)<br>
 - Modeled the proc of the Black Bow of the Betrayer.<br>
 - Serpent Sting now triggers the Global Cool Down.<br>
 - Fixed an issue with Furious Howl not accessing the correct ability rank.<br>
 - Added modeling for the Dragonspine Trophy. The user can input Shot Rotations for both under the effects of Dragonspine Torphy's haste as well as that combined with Quick Shots. The calculations tab computes the uptimes of the 4 potential states based on a user-supplied ppm rate of the Dragonspine Trophy.I am using a 1.7 ppm rate for the DST, but it is user settable right now, until I can confirm the numbers.<br>
 - Total Hunter DPS, MPS, and Shots per Second calculations are now done factoring in the effects of the Dragonspine Trophy as well.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_442623"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->A quick question re: Weapon Speed Cheeky (et al).<br>
<br>
I just saw your comment for the first time (a few posts up) that due to its speed the Wolfslayer Sniper Rifle beats out Sunfury Bow of the Phoenix.  I was a bit surprised--not to mentioned saddened because I like bows--but could believe that the greater frequency of shots makes up for a 3-4 dps difference.  <br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">A quick question re: Weapon Speed Cheeky (et al).<br>
<br>
I just saw your comment for the first time (a few posts up) that due to its speed the Wolfslayer Sniper Rifle beats out Sunfury Bow of the Phoenix.  I was a bit surprised--not to mentioned saddened because I like bows--but could believe that the greater frequency of shots makes up for a 3-4 dps difference.  <br>

The <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=27526" target="_blank">[Skyfire Hawk-Bow]</a> is a 1.74 second rotation unhasted, and 1.51 with Quick Shots.

It's a great weapon. It's on an almost perfect speed for a 1:1 cycle and MM/Survival Hunters. I never got one to drop, so I can't say what DPS I'd see with it. I do trust the math though, and believe it to be a far better weapon than some of the earlier epics.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<!-- message -->
		<div id="post_message_442897"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->This is because of the way you have specified your latency/lag - the 2.4 weapon series under quick shot haste state (quiver/pouch, serpent swiftness, quick shots) gives you a tuned fire rate that eliminates any down time between steady shots (i.e. removes any wasted time from dealing damage with steady shot), and does not clip autoshot (i.e. the end of the steady shot and the beginning of the autoshot 0.5 seconds later does not exceed the normal autoshot frequency of the weapon).  That is an autoshot cycle time of 1.51s and a steady shot time of 0.94s.<br>
<br>
If you introduce human interface lag of 0.1 seconds (i.e. it takes you about 0.1s to tell the game you want to shoot your next shot) and a latency time of 0.2s (i.e. it takes your computer 200ms to tell the WoW server that you have requested a shot), then you are no longer have a perfectly tuned auto/steady shot timings.  Latency does not translate directly into lost shot time in practice, but Cheeky has a latency factor (0-1) that simulates these delays (maybe not up to Australian standards over 1 second latency  - but should work to model most states)<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I thought about it being a latency thing after I took off for work.  I guess I had always ignored that part of the spreadsheet because I've seen mine jump around so much at times.  It seems, as of late, to have settled to about 200-300ms.  At these values, the Skyfire Hawk Bow was outpaced by the Steelhawk/Wolfslayers/Sunfury and I'm sure most everything else.  <br>
<br>
Interestingly (to me) at .2secs lag, Wolfslayer still beast out Sunfury as you claimed.  At .3secs, however, the Sunfury once again outpaces the Wolfslayer.  While I still agree to some extent that Blizz has really botched hunter itemization when I see that in a perfect world a SH/early Kara weapon destroys all of the others, in a non perfect world it seems to fall back into place the way Blizz intended.  For my part, I think I will probably still try to pick up that Sunfury for fear that I would confidently use the Wolfslayer but find out that lag is gimping me.  Regardless, thanks for the great spreadsheet Cheecky, it never ceases to amaze me with its amount of detail!<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I sort of took a short hiatus from posting, but I believe the numbers posted from the rogue spread sheets are going to be the most accurate. I was under the impression that a glancing blow cause a 50% damage reduction, but the rogues are going to be our best source here so I would go with whatever numbers they have on it.<br>
<br>
edit: also, I do believe that glancing blows only apply to level 73 elites. I could be mistaken, but the rogue that told me about them said they only apply to elite raid bosses. The goal was to reduce the insane DPS rogues/warriors were putting out in a raid setting (because of how well they scale with group compositions and buffing), while their DPS in a 5man or solo setting was fine. I will pick our rogue class leader's brain later for more information.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

While it's near impossible to show all the various combinations, it'd be nice to look at the list of 10-20 helms, for example, and say "taking this one will increase my DPS by X, this one by Y, and this one is inferior to what I have now." Even simple comparisons between two items is fairly clunky with your system if there's a need to reset gems for each of the two.<br>
<br>
Any chance you could add in a direct item comparison, either for a class of armor, or just a side by side comparison of 2 items?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Because shot rotations figure so prominitely in the calculations it would require me replicating the work for each place I wanted a new DPS value for. There are a lot of calculations involved. This is the same reasoning why I don't provide a +1 &lt;insert stat here&gt; number. It makes maintenance a real pain.<br>
<br>
If you use Excel, you can "Save" a gear set for quick comparisons. It's not really elegant, but it's much easier for me to manage.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>In all honesty, while it would be a great feature, it's certainly not one that's worth spending a lot of time on, which is why I said if it's not too much trouble.  The reality is, as hunter's we'll only be using a small subset of gems.  I'm sure the majority of users have the names memorized at this point, and the letter shortcuts would simply shave a few seconds off each time we rearrange gear.<br>
<br>
Edit: The workaround for typing the first letter then hitting the down key requires that you actually put entries for the letter headers into the list it seems.  Basically, they suggest putting into the list containing all the gems a letter heading before each group.  Your list would look something like this then:<br>
<br>
B<br>
Balanced Nightseye<br>
Balanced Shadow Draenite<br>
...<br>
Brutal Tanzanite<br>
D<br>
Dazzling Chrysospace<br>
...<br>
Delicate Tourmaline<br>
E<br>
Enigmatic Skyfire Diamond<br>
...<br>
<br>
Then, you could type the first letter in the cell, and since it would match an entry, the cell would select the D entry.  Then you can hit the arrow that pops the list up, and you'll be on the D entry to start, since it's a valid list entry, and can begin searching for your match from there.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_451013"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I am not certain where to post this as it deals with Cheeky's spreadsheet, Hunter Help, and BM Hunter raiding so I will go with them all.  I hope this doesn't get me in trouble.<br>
<br>
First off let me state I use Cheeky's spreadsheet extensively and very much appreciate him taking the time to put together a spectacular tool (been using it since around revision 17 or so I think).  I am stuck at the point were I may be considering going after a DST.<br>
<br>
I currently use the Sunfire bow (2.9 spd), I have the Wolfslayer but never was able to show the actual gains from using the faster weapon in blasted lands and I hate the gun animation and I noise I have to admit.  An example WWS is given below, this one for Lurker:<br>
<br>
1193 dps on Lurker (Scorpion)<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080411050306/http://www.lossendil.com/wws/?report=obkqk23urgx5q&amp;s=9008-9602&amp;a=76" target="_blank">Fola - WWS</a><br>
<br>
1099 dps on Gruul (Ravager)<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080411050306/http://www.lossendil.com/wws/?report=crulwsnqkiaps&amp;s=872-1264&amp;a=14" target="_blank">Fola - WWS</a><br>
<br>
Using version 27 of the spreadsheet and replacing the hourglass with DST along with taking 4 points out of improved aspect of the hawk I pickup ~95 dps.  If that truly is the dps increase I will definitely wait for it to drop.  My struggle is with that being the actual value.<br>
<br>
2.1 speed (15% static quiver and 20% serpent swiftness)<br>
<br>
2.1 speed/1.3092 (dragonspine haste effect) = 1.604 spd<br>
<br>
I use a 1:1 Rotation, Steady/Auto with KC (double macro setup)<br>
<br>
Here is where I get a little leery, when I start plugging points into Imp Aspect of the Hawk what concerns me is having them both up at the same time leading to bad clobbering at unpredictable times.<br>
<br>
If both up:<br>
1 point in Imp Aspect of the Hawk:   1.604/1.03 = 1.557<br>
2 points in Imp Aspect of the Hawk: 1.604/1.06 = 1.513<br>
3 points in Imp Aspect of the Hawk: 1.604/1.09 = 1.472<br>
4 points in Imp Aspect of the Hawk: 1.604/1.12 = 1.432<br>
5 points in Imp Aspect of the Hawk: 1.604/1.15 = 1.395<br>
<br>
The spreadsheet does show diminishing returns<br>
0 talent points to 1 = 37 dps gain<br>
1 talent point to 2   = 21 dps gain<br>
2 talent points to 3 = 13 dps gain<br>
3 talent points to 4 = 6 dps gain<br>
4 talent points to 5 = 6 dps gain<br>
<br>
My question is thus:  Is the reduced gain of the imp aspect of the hawk talent points due to clobbering?  Is the clobbering modeled?<br>
<br>
If not the trinket is still a 53 dps gain over previous builds using 5/5 imp hawk and taking it to 0/5 imp hawk (leaving attack speed at 1.604 which I can handle with my ping).<br>
<br>
Looking at it the max I would go would then be 2 points in Imp Aspect of the Hawk and deal with a little clipping to pickup 58 more dps on top of the 53 dps gain from the trinket alone.  I am just trying to get some discussion that I should focus very hard on getting the trinket over any other upgrade as it is a 111 dps upgrade much larger than any single slot ever will be again.<br>

Definitely don't do that again. I'm sure the moderators don't appreciate triplicate posts.<br>
<br>
In answer to your question, I model clobbering based on the latency and shot rotation you provide. The <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28830" target="_blank">[Dragonspine Trophy]</a> is going to be a huge advatage for you with the <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28772" target="_blank">[Sunfury Bow of the Phoenix]</a>. If the ppm numbers are accurate (I can't test myself to verify) then the math is pretty close to spot on.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

That being said if you can't reorder the gems maybe just add another gems called "N Delicate Living Ruby", "N Bright Living Ruby",  etc so it shows up next to the default gem (None).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Dude, just scroll down.  I'm not adding more entries I have to manage the stats for, it's complicated enough. I know the gem selection process isn't pretty, but it does work right now, and the gem stats seem to be accurate.<br>

If I do anything with gems it would be to start enforcing metagem requirements, since I've burned myself on this suggestioning gem choices to guildmates that canceled their 3% crit damage.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
Breakdown: pet had 25% glancing, damage reduced to 73.6% of original on average (not including crits). Claw recieved <u>no</u> glancing blows (this gives precedence to pet focus dumps ignoring standard melee rules). <br>

<br>
Breakdown: 22% glancing, 73.5% of original damage, claw and kill command, once again, do not suffer any glancing blows. <br>
<br>
<br>
It seems a glancing blow reduces damage to 74% on average. However, that does not account for critical hits (as I am 99% sure when you glance you cannot crit), which will reduce the damage further. The rogue number of 74% reduction seems fairly accurate. It is too early and I havent had my coffee yet, so I won't attempt the math on crits and total damage reduction at the moment.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_451960"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Special attacks do not glance.<br>
[Edit] Nor do crits.<br>
 <br>
On the first WWS, we see the following:<br>
Average damage for normal hits: 129<br>
Average damage for glancing hits: 95<br>
 <br>
Normal*x = Glancing<br>
x = Glancing/Normal<br>
x = 95/129<br>
x = 0.736<br>
 <br>
Reduced to 74% of normal damage.<br>
 <br>
[Edit] 26 out of 94 attacks were glancing hits. I.e. 27.7%. Keep in mind these are very small sample sizes, but they indicate pets following the same as Rogues / Warriors (not surprising).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>You can change the shot rotation to anything you want, the timings will adjust automatically.<br>
<br>
The Sunfury does more damage, but the Wolfslayer does it's damage in a shorter period of time. Short enough that unless you are clipping will out-DPS the Sunfury. Don't look at total damage, look at DPS. By the way, these are not rumors. They are the result of the basic Hunter shot mechanics.<br>

And latency is in seconds. 1 second latency would be brutal. I tend to use 200 ms (0.2 in the spreadsheet) personally.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_456173"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Cheeky, I have a simple question. I'm trying to determine ways to help other hunters and want to research it a bit before sending in a suggestion.<br>
<br>
How much, if any, would DPS be impacted if Steady Shot had it's cast time reduced from anywhere from 0.5 to 1.0? I'd imagine that clipping wouldn't be as abundant and should bring the perfect timing issue down a notch. I tried to emulate it on your spreadsheet, but due to permissions I was unable to. Of course the GCD would prevent rampant abuse, but those that are excellent hunters that manage their timing to a 0.2 delay could see an improvement and those that are terrible could even see an improvement.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Since the Gem locations are unprotected, you can modify the Validity for the cells yourself. Select all the gem cells simultaneously and change the Validation to be =Gems (default will be =INDIRECT(xxx) - different for each cell). You should be fine doing that,<br>

Open Office doesn't support as many nice features as Excel does. I will try and include some simple directions for handling some of the Open Office deficiencies.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Cheeky, I have a simple question. I'm trying to determine ways to help other hunters and want to research it a bit before sending in a suggestion.<br>
<br>
How much, if any, would DPS be impacted if Steady Shot had it's cast time reduced from anywhere from 0.5 to 1.0? I'd imagine that clipping wouldn't be as abundant and should bring the perfect timing issue down a notch. I tried to emulate it on your spreadsheet, but due to permissions I was unable to. Of course the GCD would prevent rampant abuse, but those that are excellent hunters that manage their timing to a 0.2 delay could see an improvement and those that are terrible could even see an improvement.</div>

</div>Steady Shot cast time is part of the core mechanics. I never envisioned anyone wanting to change it. From a theorectical point of view you should be able to peform the analysis you want yourself. The damage doesn't change, so you can use the spreadsheet for that and do your own timings for shots.<br>
<br>
Personally I don't think you'll see much DPS change (or any) unless you have a very high latency value specified. Decreasing the cast time just makes using a /castsequence macro much easier and less prone to clipping. It won't buy you more shots because of the global cool down, as you identified.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_456286"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->That is what I expected, but what I'm looking in to is making a suggestion to send to Blizzard to hopefully make the class a lesser hassle to deal with when attempting to DPS in a raid setting while having little to no impact on PVE DPS and especially PVP.

<br>
I don't really want to change the mechanic of the cycles or cast time of Steady Shot, but just try to do what I said above. To maintain a perfect rotation in comparison to a mage is night and day..

</div>Bad news: Extracting the items from the armory looks like it would be a painful ordeal!  It uses a database lookup table somewhere and then populate the xml with an ID and an icon.  When you mouse-over the item, the database is queried for the entry with the corresponding ID and then the item's details are returned.  It would not be easy to extract the name (Cheeky's identifier) of each item from the XML.  <br>
The good news (you knew this was coming): the talent build would be easy to extract!  Clicking on the Talents tab loads XML that contains a tag called talentTree, which is a simple number with an entry for each talent. At 57, here's my talentTree entry (41/0/7):<br>
talentTree value="2320300051521215210510000000000000000000011302000000000000000000"<br>
<br>
Also this value is the same as the one that is used on the Talent Calculator page (Export Build produces the same number appended to the url).  Seems that it would be straight forward to have a cell that accepted a number like the one above and filled in the talent section of the spreadsheet.  I know, I'm too lazy to do this manually (like any good programmer). <br>
<br>
Disclaimer: I don't know if Bliz frowns on/forbids us to extract this information automatically.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Hmm... I have the averging out of ap trinkets/BM off...<br>
<br>
I'm not saying what you wrote is wrong, just that I am probably missing something here.<br>
<br>
Because even with crits... thats only +~20% damage or so (With a 20% crit)... and 555-692 damage is 623.5 average... *1.2=748.2.  I can't see where the spread sheet is getting 921 auto shot damage from that... thats an extra 175 damage almost (All buffs should be off... Hunters mark gives some if it is counting that there but not 175 damage).  Add in the talent for crit but thats an extar 30% damage on crits which would be... 623*.2=124*.3=37...damage... (738+37=785) So thats still over 130 more damage to account for that I can't find...<br>
<br>
I'm just trying to figure out how to work it because I can't be doing it right and getting that I can do nearly 1k dps when I've never come near that before.<br>
<br>
OK I just tested it with NO ARMOR except my weapon and I STILL at 632 DPS!!!! At 5000 armor I'm doing 430 dps with NO armor except my bow!  What am I missing?<br>
<br>
BTW whats a fair armor value?  Most bosses have somewhere between like 15-30% reduction don't they?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_465802"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Hello Cheeky,<br>
<br>
Thanks for making your spreadsheet working with openoffice, as I don't have office Ms Office... Amazing work <br>
<br>
So I was playing around it a bit, and tried to configure my character with it's current gear, enchants and gems.<br>
<br>
It came up with a few problems while comparing the results with my armory profile:<br>
<br>
- the agility value is wrong (609 instead of 607). <br>
- same for the intellect : 237 instead of 233<br>
<br>
I couldn't find any reason for this  <br>
I double checked the gear configuration and it seems to be the same. Still I can't log into the game to check if the armory values are *really* correct.<br>
I can send you the filled spreadsheet if you want.<br>
<br>
Another thing I don't understand about the %hit chance:<br>
9% is the new hit cap on raid bosses. With surefooted 3/3 and the draenei racial, I need only 5% hit from gear, that's about 79 hit rating.<br>
<br>
I have 80 hit rating with my current gear, if the previous numbers are correct I should be at 100% chance to hit. But the spreadsheet give me only 99.08 chance to hit. <br>
In the calculation tab, it seems the Daenei racial is counted, so I'm confused about this. <br>
<br>
Any insights ? are my calculations wrong ? or is it a problem in the spreadsheet ?<br>
<br>

9% is the new hit cap on raid bosses. With surefooted 3/3 and the draenei racial, I need only 5% hit from gear, that's about 79 hit rating.<br>
<br>
I have 80 hit rating with my current gear, if the previous numbers are correct I should be at 100% chance to hit. But the spreadsheet give me only 99.08 chance to hit. <br>
In the calculation tab, it seems the Daenei racial is counted, so I'm confused about this.</div>

		<div id="post_message_466407"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Hello Cheeky,<br>
<br>
This morning I checked again the thread mentioning your test:<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081110032406/http://forums.tkasomething.com/showthread.php?t=9717&amp;page=3" target="_blank">Sunfury Bow of the Phoenix or Wolfslayer Sniper Rifle - Page 3 - TKA Something</a><br>
<br>
And I noticed this:<br>
<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px; ">
	<div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom:0px"><img src="assets/citation.gif" border="0"></div>
	<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" border="0" width="100%">
	<tbody><tr>
		<td class="alt2" style="border:1px inset">
			
				My last bout of exhaustive testing put it at a minimum of a 7.6% proc rate (1.7 ppm).
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>I didn't notice the 1.7 ppm part last time when I compared test results. Now considering the 1.7 ppm:<br>
<br>
X = shots per minute<br>
X * 7.6/100 = 1.7<br>
X = 22.37<br>
Y = auto shot speed<br>
X = 60/Y<br>
Y = 2.68<br>
<br>
Auto shot speed 2.68 is close to firing Don Santos without quiver(15% haste) and serpent swiftness(20% haste). There may be one 1% haste gear or enchant which brings down auto shot speed from 2.7 to 2.68. Now fom Cheeky's test, proc rate 7.6%(refresh not counted) resulted from a 0.37 shot per second test. From my test, proc rate 2.98%(refresh not counted) resulted from a 1 shot per second test. Does it mean a PPM proc model would be better to model Don Santos proc?<br>
<br>
Here are some further calculations:<br>
<br>
[Cheeky's Test assuming 2.68 auto shot only]<br>
Shots per minute : 22.37<br>
Proc rate (refresh not counted) : 7.6% <br>
PPM (refresh not counted) : 1.7<br>
<br>
[Peter's Test]<br>
Shots per minute : 5400/5376*60 = 60.27<br>
Proc rate (refresh not coutned) : 161/5400 = 2.98%<br>
PPM (refresh not counted) : 161/5376*60 = 1.80<br>
<br>
Now both test results are more consistent if we consider in PPM not proc rate.<br>
<br>
From my test with manual monitoring refresh comparing to UI record. 36.36% proc is a refresh which can't be detected by UI. Assuming there is also 36.36% proc can't be detected by UI in Cheeky's Test.<br>
<br>
[Cheeky's Test assuming 2.68 auto shot only]<br>
Estimated PPM (refresh counted) : 1.7/(1-0.3636) = 2.67<br>
<br>
[Peter's Test]<br>
PPM (refresh counted) : 253/5376*60 = 2.82<br>
<br>
These two results are close to each other too.<br>
<br>
It seems Don santos proc can be modeled by a 1.7~1.8 PPM (refresh not counted) and 2.67~2.82 PPM (refresh counted) model.<br>
<br>
But there is still some questions in my mind:<br>
<br>
1) 36.36% is obtained from my Test shooting 60.27 shots per minute. And Cheeky is shooting 22.37 shots per minute. Under PPM proc model, will I get more or less buff overlap than Cheeky's Test? Is 36.36% a good estimation for refresh not counted in Cheeky's Test?<br>
<br>
<br>
2) Referring to wowwiki, PPM proc model calculates Procs per hit base on weapon speed.<br>
<br>
Procs per hit = Weapon speed * Procs per minute / 60 <br>
<br>
Special attacks is not counted in this formula. It means that comparing PPM with a auto shot only test to a auto/steady shot test causes some inaccuracy. <br>
<br>
It seems that I should start another test with manual monitored proc with auto shot only.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>The way ppm based effects work is that the game creates a % chance per hit based on the unhasted weapon speed. Having a quiver and Serpent's Swiftness shouldn't factor into it at all. So it shouldn't matter that you fired extra shots (unless there is something like a 2 second global cooldown.)<br>
<br>
You have aroused my curiosity in this gun again, since your tests seem much more thorough than mine were. I think I'm going to have to run another several thousand shots and see what I can get this time.<br>

</div>I heard about a tank-addon that cancels specified buffs. For example a tank isn't interested in pulling with a Powerword: Shield.<br>
This addon just cancels such buffs automatically.<br>
<br>
If we go shot Dr. Boom with a proc-meter and this tank-addon to cancel Don Santos' buff we should receive accurate data about the proc-rate.<br>
<br>
Here are the downloads:<br>

</div>I really appreciate these tests. They are much better than what I have run in the past. I'm going to update the proc rate in the spreadsheet based on your final results when you total all of them together. I'm curious to see if the differences in proc rate based on Auto only versus Auto + Steady are maintained. The only thing I can think of that would account for that (based on what I know about ppm mechanics) would be if the Don had a 2-3 second internal cool down. Seems unlikely, but it would explain the results.<br>
<br>
Can you montior the re-procs to see how close together you can get them? I'm not sure how to get refreshes to appear in a combat log so we have time stamps. I'm assuming there is an event for proc refresh, since UI mods pick up on it. Does anyone have the Lua skills to write a small AddOn that will dump them to the comabt log?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I have all my options checked in my combatlog window. But there is no message when a refreshes occurs. I believe this is the reason why there is no UI for tracking refreshes. This makes massivly testing Santos very hard.<br>
<br>
I didn't formly record the behavior of refreshes. From my experience, I always see "Buff up-&gt;count down to 9 Sec remains -&gt; Reproc -&gt; count down to 9 Sec remains -&gt; Reproc". This leads me to believe there is no internal cooldown.<br>
<br>
Here is my thinking about how to estimate Refresh/Total proc percentage if we only know auto shot speed and proc chance, using data of Test 2.<br>
<br>
a) Assumes there are only two cases "Proc-&gt;Reproc" and "Proc-&gt;Reproc-&gt;Reproc".<br>
<br>
b) In Test 2, 1 shot per 1.96 second, it means there are 5 shots between a Santos buff up and Santos buff off.<br>
<br>
c) There is 5.63% chance for these 5 shots to proc. It means there is 1-(0.9437*0.9437*0.9437*0.9437*0.9437) = 25.15% chance to have at least one Reproc after a Proc.<br>
<br>
d) Reproc extends the original buff time minimum 1.96 second maximum 9.8 second. The average buff extended time is 5.88 second, allowing 2 shots before the extended buff is off.<br>
<br>
e) There is 5.63% chance for these 2 shots to proc. It means there is 1-(0.9437*0.9437) = 10.94% chance to have at least one Reproc after a "Proc-&gt;Reproc". And 0.9437*0.9437 = 89.06% chance to have no Reproc after a "Proc-&gt;Reproc".<br>
<br>
f) Assumes RECAP records X Proc. There shoud be 0.8906*0.2515*X = 0.2240*X "Proc-&gt;Reproc" and 0.1094*0.2515*X = 0.0275*X "Proc-&gt;Reproc-&gt;Reproc".<br>
<br>
g) It means 1*0.2240*X + 2*0.0275*X = 0.279*X cannot be recorded by RECAP. This is the estimated Refresh/Total proc percentage 27.9%<br>
<br>
h) In Test 2 the actual Refresh/Total proc percentage is 28.29%. This is quite close to 27.9%.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
There is another Santos test in #72. The result is UI counted 1.3 PPM under 2.25 auto shot speed.<br>
<br>
To estimate the PPM with refreshes. Assumes proc chance is 1.72/60*2.25 = 6.45%. There are 5 shots between Buff up and off. Average buff extended time is 4.375 second, allowing 2 more shots. The estimated Refresh/Total proc percentage is 26.33%. It means the estimated PPM with refreshes is 1.64. This is close to the result in my Test 1. <br>
<br>
I believe the PPM of Santos is between 1.64~1.72 under auto shot only rotation. But how the PPM changes after we fires steady shots between auto shots?<br>
<br>
If we assume the proc chance from steady shot is the same with proc chance from auto shot under a specfic shot speed, we should expect the PPM under Auto/Steady rotation to be 1.64~1.72 * 2 = 3.28~3.44.<br>
<br>
But Test 1 shows 2.87 PPM. This leads me to believe the proc chance from steady shot is lower than that from auto shot.<br>
<br>
Comparing Test 1 and Test 2, firing steady shots every 1.96 second contributes 2.87-1.72 = 1.15 PPM to the total PPM. Proc chance from steady shot is 3.76%.<br>
<br>
I hope results from Test 3 will verify this 3.76%/1.15 PPM results. But to have steady shot only rotation I have to fire steady shot every 1.5 GCD to prevent auto shot firing. This means that in Test 3 I am firing steady shot every 1.5 second, much faster than 1.96 second in Test 1.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_471651"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I believe you can eliminate steady shots from the PPM calculations.  If we find the base PPM of the rifle we should be able to extrapolate the % chance to proc by our hasted auto shot speed and apply that same % chance to all steady shots fired.<br>
<br>
The constant proc % and increase in PPM between your two latest tests support this theory.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_471893"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I was testing out different specs with my gear and I found a possible bug. My current 18/43/0 spec is built with Endurance Training instead of imp AotH. If i move the 5 points in ET to Imp AotH my total dps actually drops from 1032.49 to 988.07. Since one has no effect on damage and the other is proc based there shouldnt be a difference. i get the same result when trying a 5/21/35 build i'm considering. I'm currently using version 22 of the spreadsheet. <br>
<br>
<br>
I also have a feature request.  Is it possible to add a page that calculates time to mana exhaustion? I know that you have one on the shot rotation page but that doesn't account for pot usage. Basically I would like to be able to see how long i can extend my mana pool accounting for mp5, pot usage timer, and shot rotation.  <br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I was testing out different specs with my gear and I found a possible bug. My current 18/43/0 spec is built with Endurance Training instead of imp AotH. If i move the 5 points in ET to Imp AotH my total dps actually drops from 1032.49 to 988.07. Since one has no effect on damage and the other is proc based there shouldnt be a difference. i get the same result when trying a 5/21/35 build i'm considering. I'm currently using version 22 of the spreadsheet.</div>

</div>Well that would explain it. It never occured to me that the quick shots tab was used for that. I sort of assumed that it was for testing a shot rotation while Quick Shots was active. Sorry for the misinformation then. Should the quick shots tab be used for all shot rotation testing only if you have imp Hawk instead of the shot rotation tab?<br>

		<div id="post_message_472738"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Although it wasn't listed in the changes, I've noticed a difference in the DPS calculations for armor negation between version 27 and 28.  I'm just curious what the math is now (it doesn't list the armor of the target as it did previously, I used to set it at 8000) and how good of an indicator it is.  For example, for a 41/20/0 BM hunter like myself it currently says that Gronnstalker's Spauldors (w/ 10crit / 7agi gems) are about on par for DPS with Mantle of the Tireless Tracker, which I find strange.  I would've imagined Blizzard intended Tier 6 to do more damage.<br>
<br>
My guild is just starting to clear Black Temple/Hyjal, and I'm trying to pick out the gear I want before it drops, and I use a lot of the information on these forums and the spreadsheets to make decisions. Doing my best to be an informed PVE hunter.<br>
<br>
Edit: I'm a huge noob, I just realized that all you did was move the location of that field (it's in the settings tab now, not the gear tab). The math looks more accurate now.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

The problem with trying to create a spread sheet for this (which you can find <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080514153143/http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=pb1fNrANhw3ESW331zCx1UA" target="_blank">here</a> by the way) is that the entire thing is spec, gear, and stat dependent, so there is no list that will tell you what's best for you unless you happen to have whatever spec and gear everything was modeled off of. If this were to be done it would need to be a spreadsheet with close to the same level of complexity as Cheeky's spread sheet. You would have to be able to enter spec, current stats/gear, pet, among other things and base the weighed outcomes on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080514153143/http://forums.tkasomething.com/showthread.php?t=9542" target="_blank">Arcazua's AEP 2.0 </a>values to get something that would be accurate for everyone.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
I understand that it's not perfect but it's certainly easier to rank gear on a first run based off AEP then it is to try and put everything all together at once.  For someone like me who is running things as groups can be found.. it's nice to be able to pull up quick upgrades.. and personally the armory upgrade recommendations are flat out wrong most of the time from my experience.<br>
<br>
I am not a newbie.. just not been a hunter before, so I am trying to find some equivalences between what I am used to and the new class to hopefully make the migration easier.<br>
<br>
However, with that being said, that was the information I was attempting to find and I appreciate it!<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I did a few searches for 'hunter's gear guide' and 'hunter excel gear list' and came up empty on both regards...<br>
<br>
I have looked at Cheeky's excel sheet and it's pretty neat but for someone just hitting 70 and not familiar with the plethora of gear options.. a simple gear ranking sheet would be extremely helpful.  Is there something I am not finding because of my search parameters?  <br>
<br>
I know the rogues have an excellent gear ranking guide based of AEP, MAEP, DAEP, etc.. I used it a whole lot making my rogue and it truly helped immensely.  Is there something comparable for hunters?<br>
<br>
If there's not would anyone be interested in working with me to create one?  I have the template done for one, just need some help adjusting the weight of stats in order to get an appropriate AEP rating for hunters.</div>

</div>Yep.  Using Cheeky's spreadsheet and my current gear, with my typical raid buffs, I came up with the following values:<br>
<br>
<br>
1 agi = 0.639 dps<br>
1 ap = 0.276 dps<br>
1 cr = 0.530 dps<br>
<br>
<br>
I just multiplied by 10 when setting the values to make things a bit easier, (1agi = 6.39, 1ap = 2.76, 1cr = 5.30), and estimated some values for hit rating (because it caps), intellect, mana/5, and stamina.  Really these values fluctuate from fight to fight, depending on your assignment and group setup...since sometimes you might have a shadowpriest and then as BM, intellect and mana/5 become useless.  Some fights stamina is worth more than others.  On Vashj you don't need to max out your hit rating really to kill elementals and bats effectively.<br>
<br>
I just used:<br>
<br>
1 agi = 6.39<br>
1 ap = 2.76<br>
1 cr = 5.3<br>
1 hr = 5.0<br>
1 int = 1.0<br>
1 stam = 1.0<br>
1 mana/5 = 6.39<br>
<br>
and feel fairly confident with the results so far.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Hunter's Mark would be my first guess. It's amazing how much damage you loose when it falls off. For a 2.7s weapon that's ~85 damage before modifiers.<br>
<br>
Also, different bosses have different armor values. Try a bit of Dr. Boom testing to see how accurate the numbers are for you. I think Boom has between 25-30% armor.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_476426"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Okay to clear up a few things...<br>
<br>
1. I like the AEP system because for me not knowing what gear I want at all helps me narrow the list.  Right now Cheeky's spreadsheet has A LOT of gear.. and I don't know where a lot of it is.  So the AEP system allows me to narrow the gear to 5 mans only to start, then move on to Kara and above... It helps me at a glance learn what's available for each slot.. and then I know if I want Head Slot A from say BM, then there is no reason to take Head Slot B from Arc, unless no one needs it and it's an upgrade.  I prefer to pass or greed on items I will only consider temporary items, because I would rather someone be given a shot at an item, if nothing else for the gold, then upgrade only to turn around and vendor sell it an hour later when I get the piece I really want.  At higher instances it's less of an issue because you don't progress as fast as you do through the 5 man stage.  <br>
<br>
2. I appreciate all the links of information, I am researching them now.  Cheeky again great job on the spreadsheet, it's just a bit overwhelming when you have no clue of what's available to you as an unguilded hunter trying to get geared before app'ing to a guild.<br>
<br>
Side Note: I recently returned to the game and transferred off a PvP server to a PvE server, to play with a real life friend.  We are both unguilded at the moment and want to make sure we get our gear in order and present ourselves as respectable players before app'ing to a guild.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_476605"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Just to give some more info on how I have been testing:<br>
<br>
1) In the spreadsheet<br>
    - I have double checked that the values derived from gear match those on my character sheet<br>
<br>
    - I've turned off things like TBW and +AP from on-use trinkets<br>
<br>
    - When making the comparison I've taken into account that I won't have FI on Dr Boom<br>
<br>
2) Testing against Dr Boom<br>
    - I keep Hunter's Mark refreshed. I realize that the first 30 shots will average out a little lower, but that this effect will be fairly minimal over a longer period of time. If I did the math correctly the AP contribution from hunters mark should be 110 + 330/2 = 275 instead of 440 for those shots. I just did some back of the envelope calculations and the 30 initial shots should not impact the average accross 400 shots by more than 1%.<br>
    <br>
    - My averages are for around 400 auto shots. The average does not seem to move a whole lot at this point. I'm not using trinkets/TBW<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

This has gotten me a little closer to actually observed numbers, but I am still finding I need to put in 37.5% mitigation to get my observed numbers. Still doesn't seem right. Maybe there are input ranges for which the spreadsheet is less accurate?</div>

Looks like the problems you were seeing in raids are through HM expiring. We tend to give one Hunter the responsibility to keep it up. Same guy who does Scorpid Sting, so he's used to watching cool downs.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Yep.  Using Cheeky's spreadsheet and my current gear, with my typical raid buffs, I came up with the following values:<br>
<br>
<br>
1 agi = 0.639 dps<br>
1 ap = 0.276 dps<br>
1 cr = 0.530 dps<br>
<br>
<br>
I just multiplied by 10 when setting the values to make things a bit easier, (1agi = 6.39, 1ap = 2.76, 1cr = 5.30), and estimated some values for hit rating (because it caps), intellect, mana/5, and stamina.  Really these values fluctuate from fight to fight, depending on your assignment and group setup...since sometimes you might have a shadowpriest and then as BM, intellect and mana/5 become useless.  Some fights stamina is worth more than others.  On Vashj you don't need to max out your hit rating really to kill elementals and bats effectively.<br>
<br>
I just used:<br>
<br>
1 agi = 6.39<br>
1 ap = 2.76<br>
1 cr = 5.3<br>
1 hr = 5.0<br>
1 int = 1.0<br>
1 stam = 1.0<br>
1 mana/5 = 6.39<br>
<br>
and feel fairly confident with the results so far.</div>

</div>I would recommend using Hit's actual value in the spread sheet until you reach cap and then 0 it out to get more accurate results. You may be devalueing Hit items that would be an upgrade.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_477238"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Well, I spent a ton of time (too much actually) on this tonight. I've gotten a lot of suggestions from everyone for fixes/feature/comments. Here is a listing of the change log right now:<br>
<br>
 - Fix Draenei racial to actually be counted as +1% to hit.<br>
 - Added new gear (Halaani Razorshaft, Halaani Grimshot).<br>
 - Fixed the fact that Madness of the Betrayer was always in effect, even if you didn't have the trinket.<br>
 - Updated model of Dragonspine Trophy to include a user-provisionable cooldown. Default is 20 seconds. The model had to completely change to support the internal cooldown, setting it to 0 will not generate the same numbers given previously. Please use verison 28 of the spreadhseet to get numbers for 2.1 with the Dragonspine Trophy<br>
 - Provided the user the ability to select 2.1 or 2.2 Haste Rating conversion rates. (This will be removed when 2.2 goes live.)<br>
 - Corrected some equations that would cause "Divide by 0" errors in certain shot rotations.<br>
 - Allow for multiple, user-named gear sets. 5 different sets can be maintained. The last DPS value of that set is stored as well. (This feature not available to Open Office users.)<br>
 - Added AutoOnly buttons to the Shot Rotations. This should make it eaiser to hand-build custom rotations. (This feature not available to Open Office users.)<br>
 - On a brilliant suggestion from Lactose, there is now a button (CalcAttributes) on the gear page which will instantaneously give you the DPS advantage of adding one more Agility, AP, crit, or hit. You can also enable this feature to recalculate the values every time you change gear or hand adjustments. Set Loads are exempted from this recalculation because it made loading agonizingly slow. (This feature not available to Open Office users.)<br>
<br>
<br>
Please post any additional suggestions (or pm me) that you may have that I've missed. There's a lot of cool stuff in here which should make it a little easier to evaluate future gear and compare whole sets of items. If I don't get anything major, I'll have this out tomorrow evening or early Saturday (depending on how much drinking I do tomorrow.)<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>The <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28830" target="_blank">[Dragonspine Trophy]</a> is going to make difference, I'm just not sure how much of one. When I do this same test for my gear I get numbers that are exact for AP, and 0.01 off (probably rounding/display error) for Crit and Agility. Also, try re-generating the "+1" numbers after putting the -50 hit, but before adding in the other stats, to give yourself an accurate baseline.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I just tried it looking more at the MM talents.  I get this 2x result until I put points in combat experience at which point it goes away.

<br>
I would suggest you add int, haste rating, and armor penetration as well, as they also affect dps (that's what I use in my item rating spreadsheet.)<br>
<br>
I heard a rumor that the Blizzard developers are using your spreadsheet to analyze hunter dps. Maybe you can check if the computer running the spreadsheet is in the blizzard domain and silently degrade dps by 15%... <br>

In the sheet linked above, I have no talents defined.  I have my gear under the gear tab.  I have BOK, GOA, LotP, Gift, and Elixir of Greater Agility selected.  Dropping LotP does not change the result.  Dropping any of the +agility buffs, setting the agility for a custom offhand to +1 or -1, or putting points in combat experience changes the first set of results to the second set of results.

In the sheet linked above, I have no talents defined.  I have my gear under the gear tab.  I have BOK, GOA, LotP, Gift, and Elixir of Greater Agility selected.  Dropping LotP does not change the result.  Dropping any of the +agility buffs, setting the agility for a custom offhand to +1 or -1, or putting points in combat experience changes the first set of results to the second set of results.  I am clicking the calculate button on the gear tab each time.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>I figured it out, I believe. I use a Floor() function on the final attributes of the 'Gear' tab. This is adding some problems, because with everything you set up the first point of Agility added translates to +2 Agility after Kings and Lightning Reflexes, but the second point of agility translates to +3. It adds a stair-step look to the data that shouldn't be there.<br>
<br>
In the next version I will remove the floor() function, but change display settings to not show decimal values, even though I'll carry them through the rest of the equations.<br>
<br>
Cool problem to find. Maybe I should change the macro to add +10 of each, and then divide the difference by 10? This would suck for hit rating, but I can do it for the others.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>There are going to be times (because of the floor function) where +1 Agility is seen as +2 through multiplicative buffs and times when it is seen as just +1. This is exactly what you were seeing in the version you hosted. Those times it translates into +2 are going to provide double the DPS gain as when it is +1.<br>
<br>
The fix is to carry more specific digits of data through all of the calculations. I'm doing that in the beta version and it seems to address the problem, as well as be more accurate overall.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>This is exactly what I was doing by hand prior to ver. 29.  Seemed to really help smooth out the value of each stat and minimize the times Lightning Reflexes/Master Marksman/Survival Instincts will be at a point that +1 Agility/AP is enough to change a rounding down to a rounding up and report a value that is more inline with a +2 stat increase, instead of just +1.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_478536"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Makes perfect sense, thanks =)  For things like hit where +10 could waste points by going over the cap, would it work to just subtract 10 and compare the smaller value against the current value.  It would be the same as saying your last point of the stat got you this much dps instead of saying gaining a point would increase it by this much.  I think the actual numbers would be the same.  Can also just add dps to the end of the x axis on the attribute matrix rather than having two windows.  i.e. an agi is worth x ap, crit, hit, int, armor pen, dps.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>You're right!  I had it set to a lvl 73 mob.  Once I set it to lvl 70, my Crit jumped to 27.22% which matches my armoury.  Thanks!<br>

Unfortunately, my RAP still reports 1848 on the spreadsheet but 1816 on my Armory.<br>

</div>Well, that's the real trick, ain't it. <br>
<br>
Lactose is in the process of tracking down armor values for different raid bosses. I hope to add a feature where you can select a boss and get an accurate armor value. I'll also provide Fairy Fire and Sunder Armor as mob debuffs. For now, I'd use 30-35% reduction, about ~5000 armor.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_489867"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->version 30 bug: There's a problem with the relentless earthstorm diamond in that if you don't have the correct gems it will remain active for the purposes of increased critical hit damage.<br>
<br>
RED also doesn't increase the total critical hit damage for arcane shot like other shots. If you have mortal shots the critical hit damage will be 233% unlike the other shots which would be 236.9%<br>
<br>
Mark of conquest seems to be listed as 42.8 mp5? I'm sure this is just a typo, it's closer to 32 mp5, definitely between 30-35.<br>
<br>
Choker of Serated Blades is incorrectly listed as having 154 armor penetration when in fact it is 175.<br>
<br>
On a different note, would it be possible to make public the calculations for attributes + 1? Specifically haste, it seems … incorrect.<br>
<br>
edit: Calculations!D32 has a typo Ranged WeaponWeapon DPS<br>
<br>
edit: After looking at the mark of conquest calculation it seems like the problem is that you have it as a flat chance on hit. From my testing the internal cooldown is 17 secs (very confident of that number) with a 13% chance to proc (reasonably confident of that number.)<br>
<br>
edit: The problem with the +1 haste attribute was that I had <i>just</i> passed the quick shots "haste cap" effectively halving the +1 haste value.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>There is no "definitely" because it's a hitproc and therefore it's dependant on your attackspeed/shotfrequency. Theoretically there are quite higher effective mp5-values possible than 42,8.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">edit: After looking at the mark of conquest calculation it seems like the problem is that you have it as a flat chance on hit. From my testing the internal cooldown is 17 secs (very confident of that number) with a 13% chance to proc (reasonably confident of that number.)</div>

</div>Okay I see how it works now... Pick a pet.. train it... pick it's abilities.. catch your DPS.<br>
<br>
Also, it's still using the Scorpid pre-patch if I am correct.. so I can just go ahead and discount it.  <br>
<br>
I really appreciate all your work Cheeky, I honestly have no idea how you do it!<br>
<br>
Looks like Ravager and Wind Serpent are the highest DPS pets but I worry about pathing and certain encounters such as Void Reaver for the Wind Serpent...<br>
<br>
Now it's time to start searching on the appropriate way to spec a pet.  I here some saying get 3 of the same pet and have 2 of them with certain resistances.. and the other with none.  Want to find some data to help me make a decision on what to do.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

This wasn't designed to find the proc chance just the internal cooldown, the problem is I took mana breaks and didn't record them so 13% is kinda sketchy.

		<div id="post_message_491297"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Hi Cheeky, great work on the spreadsheets.  I have a couple of suggestions:<br>
<br>
You can easily use your model to create a really powerful gear searching tool tailored to the hunter.  The basic concept is to work out the personalised relative value of each stat, and then create automated (for example) allakhazam search links from that; or just ordering the gear by relative value.<br>
<br>
There are a few relatively easy (but kind of major) tweaks you need to make to allow this to happen.  <br>
- Create a simple macro that creates an array with the relative merit in terms of both DPS and "time till oom" for every stat.  You do this by setting the base dps and time till oom, then increasing each stat by 1 in sequence and recording the impact on dps/time till oom.  This is actually much easier than it sounds.<br>
- from here, you have scores for each stat and can create weighted allakhazam searches (eg my personalised base search for dps armor would be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081109225942/http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/itemadvsearch.html?itemclass=4&amp;quality=3&amp;quality=4&amp;itemname=&amp;binds=-1&amp;minlevel=&amp;maxlevel=&amp;mindps=&amp;maxdps=&amp;speedmin=0.0&amp;speedmax=999.0&amp;effect=0&amp;showall=0&amp;rd=o&amp;dep=n&amp;source=Live&amp;stat1=0&amp;statval1=&amp;stat2=0&amp;statval2=&amp;stat3=0&amp;statval3=&amp;sort1=agility&amp;sortwt1=0.598620942814932&amp;sort2=attack&amp;sortwt2=0.308056655067958&amp;sort3=rangeattack&amp;sortwt3=0.308056655067958&amp;sort4=critrating&amp;sortwt4=0.526278230538537&amp;sort5=hitrating&amp;sortwt5=0.479700522306302&amp;sort6=s_red&amp;sortwt6=4.92890648108732&amp;sort7=s_yellow&amp;sortwt7=4.92890648108732&amp;sort8=s_blue&amp;sortwt8=4.92890648108732&amp;sort9=s_meta&amp;sortwt9=7.39335972163099&amp;locale=enUS&amp;search=1<br />" target="_blank">this link</a> which i automatically generated knowing agi is worth 0.6, AP 0.31 etc etc (with some assumptions about the best gems, and for me excluding raid drops due to current time zone constraints on my raiding).  You can then make simple changes in allakhazam to sort by slot etc.  The search for weapons is slightly different.<br>
- you can then create a column on each of the gear sheets that has the same weighting, and use this to sort gear in terms of merit rather than alphabetical order.  You could also include perhaps a "score" for the gear selected on the gear spreadsheet including both the dps score and "time till oom" score to make the new selection simpler.<br>
- to allow this sorting to happen you have to use "vlookup" rather than "lookup".  Lookup is quite limited in that your lists have to be alphabetical to find the linked value.  vlookup just looks for matches - so your list can be sorted in any way.  Basically this involves changing every lookup on the gear sheet - which sounds major, but only takes an hour or so with some smart search/replacing.<br>
<br>
Like I said I've kind of had a dodgy go at this.  If you want to see what I've done I can email my crappy version of the spreadsheet file to you.  I have to admit and apologise up front that I've done a dodgy crack of your spreadsheet to make these changes myself - excel security sucks :/.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_493129"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->With respect to the macros in Mac OSX, the problem with the buttons is that they are implemented using activeX controls, which are not available on the mac. It is possible to use a different type of button which works on both Mac and PC using the forms toolbar (so I understand). It would probably be a lot of work changing it over (and since I can't run the macros manually there are probably more problems than just the buttons). Anyway whilst some of the convenience of the spreadsheet isnt available to max excel users its still a fabulous tool.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
How does your spreadsheet calculate the hit cap? I was under the impression that a hunter's base hit cap against a boss is 9% (taken from the sticky in this forum) and according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081109225942/http://hunterguide.wikispaces.com/Theorycraft" target="_blank">Lacoste's info</a> one point of weapon skill (not rating) gives 0.24% hit. That'd put a dwarf with a gun (or a troll with a bow, I suppose) at a cap of 7.8% or 123 hit rating. I have exactly 123 hit rating equipped and a gun, but yet when I unequip hit rating in your spreadsheet it still reports a 100% hit chance. According to your spreadsheet, the hit cap with specialization taken into account seems to be at 91 or 92 hit rating (and yes, I have set the mob lvl to 73 in the settings). What have I missed? Thanks in advance.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I did not yet incorporate all the bugs found here, there were a few infrastructure changes I focused on. There is also a set of basic instructions which should get posted to the top of the thread soon.<br>
<br>
Change Log:<br>
 - Corrected item stats (<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=29301" target="_blank">[Band of the Eternal Champion]</a>, <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=23542" target="_blank">[Fel Edged Battleaxe]</a>, <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28614" target="_blank">[Grand Marshal's Chain Gauntlets]</a>)<br>
 - Converted gear matrix to use VLOOKUP instead of LOOKUP. This will allow for more features to be added later.<br>
 - Gear sets now save race, talent spec, shot rotations (all 4), and Pet details.<br>
 - Added ability to Export and Import all 5 profiles. This only loads them into the database, to see the information you need to Load the specific profile back on the Gear tab. The file CheekyHunterDPS.log is created/read in the My Documents directory.<br>
 - Corrected bug in calculating shot numbers for DST rotations.<br>
 - Renamed Shot Rotation buttons to better correspond with common naming.<br>
 - Changed MaxSpecials rotation to build 1:1.X rotations based on whether or not the user wishes to include Multi or Arcane Shots.<br>
 - Changed PriorityRotation to not allow clipping, but only sub in Arcane and/or Multi when the next Steady Shot will not clip because of GCD.<br>
 - Provide a 1:1.X rotation button for Quick Shots.<br>
 - Updated Scorpid Poison rank 5 to be 55 damage over 10 seconds.<br>
 - Changed the Spell Coefficient for Scorpid poison to be 0.1<br>
 - Moved custom target information in 'Settings and Results' tab. Display effective reduction values for both Hunter and Pet.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

One weird thing that I noticed though, was that I got got two different buffs from it; one larger expected stack of extra ap, and sometimes a smaller stack of exta spelldmg would start building. It didn't take long for me to realize that it was Kill Command which initiated that spelldmg-stack. I guess this means that Kill Command does spelldamage. As this is pretty minor, I can realize if Cheeky simply says "no, this is to minor for a fix", I'm curious if this is taken into account while modeling the Crusade card in the spreadsheet ("this" being the fact that Kill Command would deal more damage if you have the card, especially in a longer fight where the pet is just hitting the boss, like Void Reaver or Morogrim).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I did an analysis on the official forums on the 2.2 DST and it really doesn't help MM/Survival Hunters anymore from a DPS standpoint. You don't get enough of a haste effect with the 2.9s-3.0s weapons to out DPS the 1:1.5 rotation unhasted. It's a good way to recover a ton of mana efficiency at the cost of some DPS, but it won't increase your damage done.<br>
<br>
For BM Hunters the haste proc isn't up enough with the internal cooldown to make up for the DPS lost staying in a 1:1 rotation unhasted with slow weapons.<br>
<br>
Whatever the intent to control Rogue DPS was, the changes to haste/DST pretty much wrecked it for Hunters. For really high DPS slow weapons it is nice (BM Hunters only), but it's not a whole lot better than other trinkets.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
I play survival spec with 1:1.5 rotation.<br>
I noticed a 80dps loss when going from 100ms lag to 300ms lag in the spreadsheet.  The reason for this is that autoshot is delayed by about .3 seconds every step of the way in my rotation.<br>
<br>
Since fixing the lag isn't really a reliable option, I was wondering if a stop casting macro would be viable like the mages use.<br>
<br>
has anyone messed around with different ways to eliminate down time in the rotation in such a way?<br>
<br>
Like i said, eliminating the lag from a rotation, could yeild 80-100 dps difference for a 1:1.5 rotation that is so dependant on lag time.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>you can see where i let 2 auto shots go off without casting any other spells.  the delay was 2.56  which is VERY close to the 2.52 target time.<br>
<br>
as soon as the rotation starts, most are 2.8-2.9 some worse some better.<br>
<br>
I have a macro for steady auto, the same one that everyone uses, while steady is going im spamming my arcane shot.<br>
<br>
the rotation i use with 0 lag, should not interrupt auto shot.  but we can see here in the log that its being delayed by almost half a second every time.  I attribute this to the 300ms lag I normally get to my wow server.<br>
<br>
edit: this leads me to believe that autoshot dps might not be much affected by lag on its own, but cast lag and gcd lag have a major affect.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Any macro gets punished by lag.  There is also a fair bit of jitter in combat logs. <br>
<br>
The log you link has a bunch of long delays between shots, so it's not real useful to draw conclusions from. Getting a similar log from a stand-still fight like Dr. Boom is a better way to generalize. You have periods with 4-5 seconds between Auto Shots, I'm assuming this is from movement, bandaging, etc.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>You can find your RAP in the 'Calculations' tab. Good idea on moving that to the 'Settings and Results' though, I'll try and get that done in the next version.<br>
<br>
If the buttons don't work it's usually 1 of 2 problems:<br>
<br>
1 - You are not using Microsoft Excel, but Open Office. Open Office does not support Visual Basic, which is what the buttons use.<br>
<br>
2 - You are using Microsoft Excel, but you have the security settings set to not use macros. The buttons are macros, and in general macros could do potentially bad things to your computer. Mine do not (and it's one of the reasons I password protect the whole thing.) You can enable macros for the spreadhseet and the buttons should do what they are supposed to.<br>

When you click the buttons, it saves the set to whatever the set name currently is in cell B6 on the Gear Tab. You can use the drop down box to select a different set to save or load in that cell. You can change the name of the sets in cell H27-H31 on the Settings and Results tab.

</div>Hmmm. I'm using Excel 2003, it could be compatibility issues, but I had a 2005 version at the job I had over the summer that worked fine, and I'm confident it was working for me on this computer with 2003 no more than a few weeks ago. Maybe it was an earlier version of the spread sheet I'm thinking of (27-29?).

</div>IIRC this was added as in 2.2 as a drop in BEM, I got it off a friendly guildie. FWIW Cheeky had it in the spreadsheet well before 2.2, I reported it as not existing at that time so he removed it - bah!<br>
<br>
The other new 2.2 patterns are: <a class="q2" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=31870" target="_blank">[Design: Great Golden Draenite]</a>, <a class="q2" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=31871" target="_blank">[Design: Balanced Shadow Draenite]</a>, <a class="q2" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=31873" target="_blank">[Design: Veiled Flame Spessarite]</a>, <a class="q2" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=31874" target="_blank">[Design: Wicked Flame Spessarite]</a>.

<br>
A little off topic, but still about Hunters:<br>
When I think about it. Is it possible, that this internal auto-casttime is affected by quiver and/or serpents swiftness (or even by IAotH)?<br>

A little off topic, but still about Hunters:<br>
When I think about it. Is it possible, that this internal auto-casttime is affected by quiver and/or serpents swiftness (or even by IAotH)?<br>

		<div id="post_message_521239"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->This version incorporates a few new big features. I have less faith in this being bug-free than any recent version, so don't delete your current version just yet. I'm going to need a lot of feedback to get the new Armory stuff just right.<br>
<br>
If it works out, I'll add scraping talents specs as well. And expanding it to EU Armories. There is little error handling done yet, so if you specify invalid character names or realms all bets are off.<br>
<br>
No new Open Office version yet. I anticipate a bunch of quick fixes this week.<br>
<br>
Change Log:<br>
 - Added Sunder Armor and Faerie Fire to target debuff list.<br>
 - Cleaned up some validation lists to remove spaces. This was causing Open Office to fail a bunch of string comparisons.<br>
 - Updated the VLOOKUPs in the Gear page. This should remove any issues with alphabetizing the gear sets. (So yes, I was an idiot when I did it the first time.)<br>
 - Corrected math behind the effects of special pet attacks on frenzy uptime. This will result in a lower % time spent in Frenzy than previous versions.<br>
 - Fixed problem where Custom Bracers were not using the supplied values for Resilience and Armor Penetration.<br>
 - Corrected the description of the Unstable Citrine to be correct (8 AP, 4 Crit).<br>
 - Corrected a bug in the Pet Special Attacks table that resulted in negative rates of use for low focus regeneration.<br>
 - Fixed all issues with Resilience, Haste, and Armor Penetration on Custom Gear.<br>
 - Added new gear from 2.3 PTR.<br>
 - Consolidated all Arena gear set names to "Gladiator's Pursuit".<br>
 - Removed Weapon skill.<br>
 - Added in Troll/Dwarf racials<br>
 - Provide for a drop down choice of different raid Bosses to get armor values. These values have no been verified, and anything with a value of "9999" is still unknown. Custom target (armor supplied by user) is still available. These can be selected by choosing your Target on the 'Settings and Results' tab. I would like to thank Lactose of Talinvarr (EU) and Dayve of Gorgonnash for providing the values so far.<br>
 - Corrected some spelling mistakes in item names.<br>
 - Added ability to load gear from Armory for a character. This is still in initial development, and will probably be very buggy for a while. Each item/gem is validated. Sometimes there are spelling mistakes in this spreadsheet and the item will not be loaded properly. Please contact Cheeky with those mistakes and I will correct them as soon as I can. Item enchants are not currently supported. These still need to be updated manually. I would like to thank Mikla of Burning Legion for providing me examples and modules to make this feature possible.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>The rep rings are going to be a royal pain in the ass. I'll see about how hard it is to compare stats. They may just have to be a special case.<br>
<br>
In all cases, drop down menus should work fine. The enchants not working is a limitation to my understanding of Armory's interfaces.  I can get a number for the enchant, but no way to turn that into a name. (The idea of my researching the mapping myself is a non-starter, I don't have the time. If someone else wants to do it, I can map from those numbers to the enchant's name.)<br>
<br>
<br>
I'm using all of you as my test team on this one. There are just too many things that need testing for me to do it myself. Keep the information coming. I'm provide updates every couple of days, I think. If you find spelling problems, please use the item tags feature in your response, so we guarantee the proper spelling.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_522957">Cheeky - Thanks for your hard work.  As hunter class officer of my guild, Ive been putting your spreadsheet to good use, which has been instrumental in maximizing our hunter crew's DPS capabilities.  The improvement that I've seen since using your spreadsheet is nothing short of remarkable. <br>
<br>
I'd like to know if anyone has been successful with using this spreadsheet on the Mac OS X version of MS Office.  I find that the spreadsheets work in every respect except for the buttons which appear to be inoperable.  <br>
<br>
I can certainly continue to manually input gear, and shots in the shot rotation table, but being able to use the buttons to automate some of this would definitely be nice.</div>

		<div id="post_message_523164">Hi Folks,<br>
<br>
I am a first time poster but a fairly long time reader of the Elitist Jerks forums. This and other threads have been highly instrumental in helping me improve my gear and shot selection immensely, so first of all can I just say a big thank-you to the community for being so great! <br>
<br>
Now for a quick question. Can anyone tell me how to get the armory load feature of the latest version (35) of Cheeky's spreadsheet working? <br>
<br>
I see the tab for load armory profile but cannot see how I input my particular realm and toon info. I have tried changing the name and realm information on the settings page but to no avail.<br>
<br>
Personally I am happy enough using manual inserts of gear, particularly as drops are often few and far between, but would nonetheless be keen to try it out in the hope it might make persuading other guild hunters to use the spreadsheets more that bit easier.<br>
<br>
Many thanks</div>

</div>I'll have more spelling mistakes fixed shortly.<br>
<br>
I'm at a dead-end in regards to scraping enchants. I can get an ID for an enchant, and I can get the text discription of the effect, but I cannot get the enchant name. I really, really don't want to translate the effect description back into the name, that would be a real pain in the ass. (I'm also running into similar problem with reputation-based rings.)<br>
<br>
My current thinking is that I'm just going to set all enchants to "None" on a Armory scrape and let the user punch them in. Not ideal, but I'm out of good ideas. If anyone can figure out a way to take the ID back into a enchant name I'd be grateful.<br>
<br>
Talents are easy, I should have that ready shortly. As well as verifying the EU URLs. (I imagine I only need to worry about the base character sheet. The item descriptions should work fine from the US servers. Slower performance for EU users, but much easier for me.)</div>

		<div id="post_message_525762">question on the calculated DPS values.  I notice that changing the bosses affects the damage done by Kill Command but not the damage done by any of the hunter's shots.  <br>
<br>
I've been wondering for a while about the actual calculated numbers - eg average steady shot damage for me is calculated as 721, while I think it hits in practice for more like 400 than 700.  I figure the spreadsheet calculates paper doll dps, but if it now includes mob armor can it then determine the actual dps on the mob selected rather than a theoretical?</div>

		<div id="post_message_526311"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Cheeky, I like the spreadsheet. I have one of my own, very similar to yours. I'd like to make couple of suggestions though. Add a worksheet for quik comparisons of the differents saved sets, showing dps, crit rate, mana, hp, rotations, etc. This will make it a lot easier for people to view the differences between the created sets. Also in my spreadsheet I set up the talents with several preset, cookie cutter specs, which I can quickly loadup and tweek from there if need be. Also I have a reset for BM talents, MM talents and SV talents.<br>
<br>
Just some ideas I thought you maybe intested in. Also the armory link downlaod is a great idea. Nice job on the sheet.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I just wanted to say the same thing. ^^<br>
<br>
1. KC delays the autoshot.<br>
2. KC isn't used as often as calculated, because you can't use it while you cast steady and you shouldn't use it while your autoshot is casting.<br>
<br>
I think the best methode to calculate the time-to-use-kc is to add it to the shot rotation with the former calculated time as cooldown.</div>

		<div id="post_message_535765">This spreadsheet is a huge help. To all those that had a hand in creating it, thank you. Really good job fellas, and then to share it here for anyone to use is very much appreciated, it makes the whole process of choosing and comparing so much more tolerable for me at least. The load from armory feature is just an added luxory.<br>
     I was wandering which ones <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33527"><span><span class="purplename">[Shifting Camouflage Pants]</span></span></a> or <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33538"><span><span class="purplename">[Shallow-grave Trousers]</span></span></a> would be more of a benefit to a BM hunter with my gear and attack speed, and I can plainly see the latter is the best.   If it wasn't for this spreadsheet that could have been a much more difficult task. Keep up the good work, and keep on a checking that math!<br>
<br>
P.S. One quick silly question, how do I link an item so I can just scroll over it here and see the stats ect.? Thanks in advance.<br>
<br>
Edit: Fixed the links. </div>

I can get the flavor text for each one, and I can translate that back into the enchant name, but I need help tracking them all down. Please PM me with any you have on your gear. Here are some examples:<br>

Minor Aesthetic thingy. Setting and results tab, haste break down 1:1.27272727272727 returned to the shot rotation column when a 1:1.3 is being used. <br>
<br>
Also, can verify that the + int enchants show in the stam column. And Major Int shows only a value of 9. Guessing it's the same problem though. <br>
<br>
<br>

Great work by the way. And the armory scanning function made this a TON more flexible for helping to compare yourself to other guild hunters without the trouble of transcribing form armory. Appreciate the hard work!</div>

<br>
I load my gear from Armory, then remove your enchants and add mine (I have only a few pieces enchanted) it says: Total DPS 853.82<br>
<br>
When I change my shoulders (<a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30055"><span><span class="purplename">[Shoulderpads of the Stranger]</span></span></a> with <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=24028"><span><span class="bluename">[Delicate Living Ruby]</span></span></a>) to anything then put back mine the Total DPS changes to 854.83<br>
<br>
It seems the socket bonus (+2agi) stays when I remove it and adds again when I put it back, total agility is 681 instead of 679 after I change shoulders. If I repeat this the socket bonus doesn't add anymore, only once.<br>
<br>
I tried to change from Stranger to shoulders with and without socket bonus (Gronnstalker / Hidden Predator) and I had the same error.<br>
<br>
Also tried items with gems (with and without socket bonus) and without gems.<br>
<br>
I only get this problem with shoulders, (I didn't try every slot though)</div>

Is there any way of implementing a threat estimation to the spreadsheets? Basically, since you can implement the rotation and estimate damage, it shouldn't - IN THEORY - be too difficult to assign threat values to regular hits and crits. <br>
It's not really any use for anything other than ranged tanking (maybe just for knowing how much threat you can get when you resist a feign or two or how much an MD amounts to halfway through the fight), and I'm really not sure it's worth the effort, but a scientific (ish) approach is always welcome, if it's not out of your way too much<br>

</div>Your TPS is identical to your DPS, unless you wanted to start throwing Distracting Shots in as part of your rotation. With no inherent threat reduction, you should stay comfortably ahead of any ranged class with BoS on them. I know I easily top 1000-1100 TPS on a fight like Morogrim, much higher than our tanks produce.

Change Log:<br>
 - Corrected more spelling mistakes for Armory compatibility.<br>
 - Added new gear (Mysterious Arrow, Mysterious Shell, Cursed Vision of Sargeras, Vengeful Gladiator's Longbow, Vengeful Gladiator's Rifle, Mystic Dawnstone, Steady Talasite, Mystic Bladestone, Steady Crysophase)<br>
 - Added Judgment of Wisdom to Target Debuffs on 'Buffs' tab.<br>
 - Support Relentless Earthstorm Diamond in first socket for helms that put Meta socket first.<br>
 - Factor miss rates into calculations in "on hit" procs for Quick Shots, Don Santos Famous Hunting Rifle, and Dragonspine Trophy. (This makes hit more valuable with those abilities/items than previously shown.)<br>
 - Corrected Aspect of the Monkey to be +8% Dodge.<br>
 - Corrected some item stats (Vengeful Gladiator's Chain Helm).<br>
 - Race is now scraped from the Armory when gear is loaded.<br>
 - Added ability set default gems for each color that will be input for any gear you select that has sockets. You can still change the gems out afterward to anything you'd like.<br>
 - Added in new food buffs (Kibler's Bits, Spicy Hot Talbuk).</div>

</div>This is great!  Maybe the spreedsheet will tell me 1 hit &gt; 1 agi now.<br>
<br>
Just a note, though, Quick Shots procs on firing, not on hit (but it doesn't take effect until the next shot -- that's why they buffed it to 12 seconds rather than the 10 seconds it used to be back in the day).  I can produce a combat log proving this if you like. <br>
<br>
EDIT:  Here's the patch note from 1.10:<br>

</div>I believe the moment you fire is also the moment hit/crit/miss is calculated. A missed ranged attack will, visually, very noticably be different than a successful ranged attack (you'll miss your target completely). Since there is no apparent teleportation or crooked movement of the projectile, this indicates the trajectory (and thus the outcome of the attack) being known from moment of fire.<br>
 <br>
Updating main posts.<br>
EDIT: Main posts updated.</div>

		<div id="post_message_544306">Good point, Lactose.  I guess the thing to do is get a low-level hunter with iAotH and go shoot Dr. Boom or something high level and see if it can proc off a shot that later misses.<br>
<br>
EDIT: Interestingly, the text for Master Tactician specifically calls out 'your successful ranged attacks' whereas iAotH says 'all normal ranged shots.'  Of course, textual differences in talent and spell descriptions has been a red herring before.  I'm taking my old level 60 hunter to Dr. Boom now. </div>

</div>Wait, you took your gear and changed your talents to Survival and saw 800+ Agility and 37% crit. Then you went and raided with the BM spec in your armory and didn't see those numbers? Honey, that's not a bug, it's not realizing that a BM spec has different Agility and crit rates than a Survival build.<br>
<br>
Your build in the Armory clearly states 41/20/0. If you use that in the spreadsheet do the numbers match up?</div>

I would mainly use it to "study" and play around with group synergy (we sometimes have 1 feral druid, some times two, same with Enh. Shamans, and so on).<br>
<br>
Every time you release an update, I am truly amazed by what you manage to do with this spreadsheet. If what I suggest is too time-consuming, pointless, or simply annoying for you, just tell me to shut up, and I'll still be happy with what you gave us. </div>

</div>Ive got to take a terrible calculus test but before i go i must say these exact numbers.  With my gear plugged exactly as it is on the armory, with zero buffs, i get 608 agility, and 27.22% crit chance.  On armory, and on my character sheet i get 585 agility and 26.44%crit.  I just realized i had put points into expose weakness which made for the false crit ratings.  Sorry.  I took it out and the numbers there reflect that.  Ill check all the gems and thing to make sure but im quite sure everything is right.  Oh P.S  Why dont the macros work on Excel for mac?  I enabled macros but i cant actually click anything...<br>

With my gear plugged exactly as it is on the armory, with zero buffs, i get 608 agility, and 27.22% crit chance.  On armory, and on my character sheet i get 585 agility and 26.44%crit.  I just realized i had put points into expose weakness which made for the false crit ratings.  Sorry.  I took it out and the numbers there reflect that.  Ill check all the gems and thing to make sure but im quite sure everything is right.  Oh P.S  Why dont the macros work on Excel for mac?  I enabled macros but i cant actually click anything...<br>
<br>
Thanks in advance!</div>

		<div id="post_message_554481">Hey there,<br>
Firstly, thanks for putting so much time into such an invaluable tool for all us hunters. I don't know what I'd do without it now.<br>
<br>
I have but two questions though.<br>
1. I was wondering if there were any plans to average out the AP gain from bloodfury like you can with trinkets?<br>
2. Are there any plans to increment the AP gain from Hunters Mark? Currently it is treated as a flat 440AP. In reality though it starts at 110 and increases by 11 for each hit up to 440, therefore a faster weapon/shot rotation would reach the 440 AP cap quicker than a slower one, give a higher average AP over the 2 minute duration of Hunters Mark than a slower rotation would.<br>
<br>
Once again, thanks for giving us such a great tool.<br>
<br>
-----------EDIT----------<br>
Actually, I do have two more questions...<br>
3. Concussive barrage isn't currently taken into account. It's a 2%/4% chance to daze the target for 4 seconds. Steady shot does an extra 175 damage to dazed opponents. So providing your target isn't immune to daze effects, it's an extra 1-2 x 175 damage (depending on weapon speed and rotation) when it procs. Which is a minimal dps increase in reality, but an increase none the less.<br>
4. Serpent sting is still only doing 660 damage in the spreadsheet. It now does (0.1*RAP)+660 damage, which although still means it's hugely mana inefficient for the damge it does, it may possibly be useable in a rotation now (??) as that damge is not mitegated by armor.<br>
<br>
Although I guess they weren't really phrased as questions...</div>

		<div id="post_message_554526">There's always one other thing, which is more of a musing really...<br>
<br>
I'm wondering how the Shots per 8 seconds is calculated for Master Tactician?<br>
<br>
I have a 3.0 speed weapon (2.609 actual speed), 4/5 imp Arcane shot, and using a 1:1.x rotation (arcane only) with a 0.2 second latency, and I'm working on the assumption that you are using Uptime = 1 - (ChanceNotToProc^Attacks)<br>
<br>
My shots per 8 seconds in the Master Tactician section of the calculations sheet shows 7.4. However, I think this value is too high, certainly in my situation.<br>
<br>
I have gone through my full rotation and worked out how many complete shots can be landed within an 8 second window after each shot is fired. Any incomplete shots will not effect the proc chance of Master Tactician so should be disregarded.<br>
<br>
My rotation consists of 5 shots, so it was a fairly easy pattern to work with. <br>
<b>Autoshot</b><br>
 7 shots can be landed after this shot within 8 seconds.<br>
<b>Steady Shot</b><br>
 7 shots ...<br>
<b>Arcane Shot</b><br>
 6 shots ...<br>
<b>Autoshot</b><br>
 6 shots ...<br>
<b>Steady Shot</b><br>
 8 shots ...<br>
and the pattern repeats.<br>
<br>
This gives me an average of 6.8 shots per 8 seconds. Then you have to factor in my miss rate of 0.73% giving 6.8*0.9927, giving me an average "Shots per 8 seconds" of 6.75.<br>
<br>
Unless I'm missing something obvious?</div>

</div>It seems like all other shots still scale way better. That means that depending on your enemies armor at some point there´s a break even where the other shots will do more damage. From my personal observation I´d say this break even is somewhere around T4ish quality gear.<br>
Nevertheless I agree serpent sting should be modelled correctly as soon as Cheeky finds some time to integrate it into his spreadsheet. </div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Couple things I noticed:<br>
<br>
--Major Intellect Enchant to 1handers appears to add 9 stamina instead of 30 intellect<br>
--No PvP trinkets (Intentional? Ignore this comment if so.)<br>
<br>
--Third thing: it's possible I'm not looking in the right area, so bear with me.  Background: I'm mainly focused on PvP. While trying to determine the Careful Aim vs. RWS decision (and likewise, the 2hander-agi enchant vs. 1handers-intellect enchant), I noticed there is no indication that total RAP is increased in the Gear table when CA is maxed out (3/3).  I'm not sure if this is an oversight or not.  I have manually added the potential RAP increase (hand adjust row).  In doing so, it sways the talent-spec decision.  I just don't want to be doubling up RAP if its already hidden somewhere I'm not looking.<br>
<br>
Other than those few things, the spreadsheet is a godsend.  Amazing work.</div>

</div>The question on Careful Aim was answered correctly above. Thanks for spotting the melee enchant fuck up. I'll get that fixed. The PvP trinket will be added, just so resilience can be tracked (and Armory scrapes.)<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Hey there,<br>
Firstly, thanks for putting so much time into such an invaluable tool for all us hunters. I don't know what I'd do without it now.<br>
<br>
I have but two questions though.<br>
1. I was wondering if there were any plans to average out the AP gain from bloodfury like you can with trinkets?<br>
2. Are there any plans to increment the AP gain from Hunters Mark? Currently it is treated as a flat 440AP. In reality though it starts at 110 and increases by 11 for each hit up to 440, therefore a faster weapon/shot rotation would reach the 440 AP cap quicker than a slower one, give a higher average AP over the 2 minute duration of Hunters Mark than a slower rotation would.<br>
<br>
Once again, thanks for giving us such a great tool.<br>
<br>
-----------EDIT----------<br>
Actually, I do have two more questions...<br>
3. Concussive barrage isn't currently taken into account. It's a 2%/4% chance to daze the target for 4 seconds. Steady shot does an extra 175 damage to dazed opponents. So providing your target isn't immune to daze effects, it's an extra 1-2 x 175 damage (depending on weapon speed and rotation) when it procs. Which is a minimal dps increase in reality, but an increase none the less.<br>
4. Serpent sting is still only doing 660 damage in the spreadsheet. It now does (0.1*RAP)+660 damage, which although still means it's hugely mana inefficient for the damge it does, it may possibly be useable in a rotation now (??) as that damge is not mitegated by armor.<br>
<br>
Although I guess they weren't really phrased as questions...</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>1. Good idea. Will add it in the next version (due out later today, actually.)<br>
2. I model an instantaneous point in an infinite length encounter. I'm not really interested in looking into build-up times and all the work that would take. I can provide a rough "time to maxed out mark" though, I'll look into it.<br>
3. See <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302184514/http://elitistjerks.com/f40/t9274-hunter_mechanics_v2_0_tbc/p45/#post359558" target="_blank">here</a> for the math on how useless that ability is. If I'm really bored one day I'll add it in. <br>
4. Corrected in the next version.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">There's always one other thing, which is more of a musing really...<br>
<br>
I'm wondering how the Shots per 8 seconds is calculated for Master Tactician?<br>
<br>
I have a 3.0 speed weapon (2.609 actual speed), 4/5 imp Arcane shot, and using a 1:1.x rotation (arcane only) with a 0.2 second latency, and I'm working on the assumption that you are using Uptime = 1 - (ChanceNotToProc^Attacks)<br>
<br>
My shots per 8 seconds in the Master Tactician section of the calculations sheet shows 7.4. However, I think this value is too high, certainly in my situation.<br>
<br>
I have gone through my full rotation and worked out how many complete shots can be landed within an 8 second window after each shot is fired. Any incomplete shots will not effect the proc chance of Master Tactician so should be disregarded.<br>
<br>
My rotation consists of 5 shots, so it was a fairly easy pattern to work with. <br>
<b>Autoshot</b><br>
 7 shots can be landed after this shot within 8 seconds.<br>
<b>Steady Shot</b><br>
 7 shots ...<br>
<b>Arcane Shot</b><br>
 6 shots ...<br>
<b>Autoshot</b><br>
 6 shots ...<br>
<b>Steady Shot</b><br>
 8 shots ...<br>
and the pattern repeats.<br>
<br>
This gives me an average of 6.8 shots per 8 seconds. Then you have to factor in my miss rate of 0.73% giving 6.8*0.9927, giving me an average "Shots per 8 seconds" of 6.75.<br>
<br>
Unless I'm missing something obvious?</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>I use a weighted Shots per Second over all haste states. This won't be perfectly accurate, since in general you don't have partial shots in the real world. Like most models in the spreadsheet this is an approximation. You can trace the "Shots per Second" calculation back to the different Shot Rotations. If you find a bug, I'd love to hear about it, I'm not 100% positive it's all completely correct.</div>

</div>The spreadsheet displaying the avarage of hits+crits, so if you hit for 500 and have 25% crits for 1150 (500*2.3) damage, it will display the auto shot damage as 662,5 (if i did the math correct).<br>
I think the spreadsheet asumes Sunder Armor and Curse of Recklessness as default, disable those and other target debuffs and you will see numbers close to your Dr. Boom testing case. I don't know how high armor Dr. Boom has, but i think Lactose has posted the numbers on this forum sometime in the past, you maybe should adjust this in the spreadsheet. The spreadsheet also count hunters mark as fully stacked (440 AP) so you have to hit the target 30 times before getting the right numbers.<br>
<br>
There are still a few target debuffs missing, like Misery and Blood Frenzy, guess they will come into the sheet soon Cheeky?</div>

		<div id="post_message_559223">I am curious how people have set up shot rotations for their spreadsheets.<br>
<br>
How often do you insert a KC? Do the BM hunters include multi-shot (due to not being able to use it during fights with CC or  due to mana efficiency)?<br>
<br>
I guess my best bet would be to run a 3 minute test on boom (seems it would be an accurate depiction since Rapid Fire is on a 3 minute cooldown), then go back through my log and insert all the data that way.<br>
<br>
I would appreciate to find out how exactly others have set their shot rotation up for their spreadsheet though.</div>

		<div id="post_message_559524">@Sorrugis: Firstly, I do everthing manually (KC is bound to a mouse-button - MX518 just rocks  ). I use a 1:1 Auto-Steady-Rot with Arcane when it fits. I have been using Multishot everytime although being BM, but after doing a bit of research in here and in our Logs (other BM-Hunter in our Raid basically did the same DPS without using Multi at all) I dropped the Multi - a good choice, since it didn´t affect my DPS at all and made the rotation a bit more mana-efficient. I just use Multi on Trashmobs now, where real multi-hits are guaranteed.<br>
<br>
Besides that I also use Scorpid-Sting normally when mana allows it to help the healers a bit.<br>
<br>
I use KC anytime it´s availabe (normally every 5 - 7 seconds).</div>

		<div id="post_message_559575">The shot rotation you set up in the spreadsheet (and the one you will be using) depends on the fight, what mana regen you will get, if the fight relies on a constant, steady DPS, or on 'DPS phases' during which you need to burn, etc.<br>
<br>
This is what will determine what rotation you need to use.<br>
I make systematic use of KC.<br>
I Scorpid-sting a boss on my tank's request.<br>
Both my Arcane- and Multi-shots inflict more damage than an auto- or steady-shot, while consuming more mana.<br>
<br>
A priority rotation, with Arcane and Multi whenever they're up, and KC all the time (KC is almost always up, the cooldown is the the limit here), is the one that nets me the best DPS.<br>
A standard Auto-steady rotation is good, sustained DPS "that can last forever".<br>
<br>
What and when you use it is situational.<br>
If you take, lets's say, Tidewalker : it's a long fight, you might want to go with a standard auto-steady-KC rotation.<br>
If Morogrim is JoW-ed, and/or if you have a SP, or mana-tide totems, you might want to go for a higher damage rotation (we tank murlocs on top of Morogrim, so Multishot is a winner when murlocs are here).<br>
<br>
Basically, as a BM hunter, auto-steady is your base "DPS sequence" and once you start knowing the fight, you squeeze in as much DPS as you can (for me, that means replacing steady shots by arcane or multishots), depending on your mana bar, your tank's aggro, your positionning, and so on.</div>

		<div id="post_message_559597">Personally, I am lucky enough to be able to run with a SP in my group for 90% of my runs. Last WWS I have recorded ( <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080117125406/http://wowwebstats.com/ren5y1nqntytu" target="_blank">Wow Web Stats</a> ) was unfortunately one of the days when our SP was out on vacation, but I have never been one to be afraid of chain chugging mana pots for optimal DPS.<br>
<br>
I guess my main question is not that of which Shot Rotation everyone uses, but whether or not there is an "easy" way to sync up my spread sheet's shot rotation tab as close as possible to my true in game shot rotations.<br>
<br>
Maybe there a mod other than Recount (for some reason it flashes like a disco ball for me, I imagine another mod is messing with it's ability to read me as in or out of combat), that will allow me to go back and look at a complete shot rotation log for the night?<br>
<br>
Mainly, I just want to make the tab as precise as possible. I hate to keep my spread sheet at Auto--&gt;Steady--&gt;Auto--&gt;Steady when this isn't what is actually going on.<br>
<br>
Any advice would be greatly appreciated. If anyone can save me from an all night spread sheet shot rotation project, I would be in your debt.    </div>

</div>It seems to be pretty speedy this morning, the numbers fly in.  However, I'm still getting the timeout message immediately after the speadsheet hits a custom piece of gear.  (Ring of Ghoulish Delight).  A soon as I hit OK on the custom gear warning (I'm not letting it sit for any time at all) I get a timeout.<br>
<br>
Don't know if that's helpful for bug squashing or not, but I wanted to let you know.<br>
<br>
Love the spreadsheet, thank you.  I've been working with it all week and the results were very apparent on our last raid.</div>

I've been looking around on the internet to some how disable the VB debugging becuase it also detects a run-time error with the WoW Launcher but I've had no such luck either. I think both errors are directly related this VB Debugging program.</div>

My hunter shows 708 agi on character sheet but 714 in your calc in the same gear.<br>

708 - 170(Base Agility from character sheet) = 538 / 1.15 = 467.something - adding my gear up by hand you would get 468.<br>

468+153(base agi shown for Draenei in spreadsheet) = 621 * 1.15 = 714.somthing -  The number that shows up in the spreadsheet.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Okay, after all my other thousand and one edits I think I know where your deviations of agility are coming from Cheeky.<br>
<br>
My hunter shows 708 agi on character sheet but 714 in your calc in the same gear.<br>
<br>
708 - 170(Base Agility from character sheet) = 538 / 1.15 = 467.something - adding my gear up by hand you would get 468.<br>
<br>
468+153(base agi shown for Draenei in spreadsheet) = 621 * 1.15 = 714.somthing -  The number that shows up in the spreadsheet.<br>
<br>
Pulling base agi of a non surv spec Draenei hunter from Armory their base agility is 148 which multiplied by 1.15 = 170.2<br>
<br>
My apologies to any mods that saw my 8billion edits of this and so on, less math at 1am helps.<br>

		<div id="post_message_564767">Quick question Cheeky (or anyone, really):  I was playing around with different gear sets on your spreadsheet, mostly comparing high-end bows with the Wolfslayer.  As a 41/20 BM hunter following a 1:1 rotation, I was wondering if using a strict priority rotation (arcane/multi &gt; steady shot) with, say, the Ancient Sin'Dorei Longbow would be better than an auto/steady rotation with the Wolfslayer.  Long story short, when playing around with this, I noticed that even with the Wolfslayer a strict auto/steady is actually coming out as 25 dps better than the priority rotation on your sheet Cheeky.  Why would that be?  I double checked to make sure that sunder x 5 and FF were up on a target, and made sure that your default value (7700) is input on your sheet to be certain that it wasn't a 0 armor mob.  <br>
<br>
Am I misunderstanding the way your sheet compares dps compared to dmg until oom, perhaps?  I was under the impression that dps is dps is dps, and time until oom is something the hunter needed to weigh into consideration and offset with consumables.  Does your sheet actually calculate dmg until oom then divide by time until oom or am I missing something more obvious?</div>

</div>Check to make sure the spreadsheet is timing the specials correctly. There was a bug in earlier versions where the automatic rotations were ignoring the potential to clip the shot+2 Auto Shot by waiting too long to get a Special in before the current Auto Shot. This pushed back the start time for the next Steady Shot and led to clipping. It was fixed at some point when I redid the shot rotation buttons to how they are now. (The bug still exists for DST rotations.)<br>
<br>
Other than that, check shot damages, total damage, and total time for the 2 rotations. There has to be some reason the numbers are coming out like they are. Do you have 4 piece T5 or T6, both of which greatly favor pure Auto:Steady rotations?</div>

</div>1 - As far as I am concerned, I never felt the need to make simulations with level 60 items (save maybe a couple of trinkets).<br>
2 - I don't. I could never make it work (I rename the .xls files once downloaded, so that the filename shows the version. That might be why). To be honest, the Import from Armory feature, and the time I spent playing around with your spreadsheet allow for very fast full re-filling in of the sheet. And I like to follow your gear upgrades avery time I get a new version </div>

<br>
I don't know if someone already asked you this, but do you think it would be possible to add a feature to manage burst effects in the spreadheet. Currently, the various trinkets &amp; hunter abilities are modelised to represent an average value over time when used alone. There is no burst management that modelise the benefits of using them at the same time. (ie: rapid fire + bestial wrath + trinket will provide more dps than rapid fire, then bestial wrath, then trinket)<br>
<br>
I know if would be quite difficult to modelise this since there are different cooldowns but it would already be a nice step to have a way to modelise a customizable burst mode. For example, let us define what trinkets, abilities or buffs we want to use and see how much dps it adds to use them alltogether.<br>

		<div id="post_message_566303">That´s an interesting question you raise enia. I´ve also been thinking about that for a long time. Especially the question, if it´s better to wait one minute with rapid fire (from the second on) to be able to use it combined with BW &amp; BB (meaning a tripel-activation every 4 minutes) or to use rapid fire on every single CD, and therefore only have an activation of all 3 combined every 6 minutes. I haven´t yet come to a conclusion which provides better results, though. Can anybody provide a model to approximate this case?</div>

I have 2 problems to report:<br>

- I was unable to load my gear from the Armory (EU), but I'm not sure if the problem comes from the sheet or the armory website. The armory seems to work fine though.<br>

</div>If you turn off averaging out trinkets and TBW, you can hand activate all of them (except <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32658"><span><span class="bluename">[Badge of Tenacity]</span></span></a>) along with Rapid Fire, TBW, etc. from the Shot Rotation. The best way to do this is to clear all shots, skip the first one, and start selecting effects and shots after that. You'll be able to see in the Proc Expire matrix when your effects will end. At that point leave the rest of the Shot Rotation blank and you can see the DPS during your "burst" time.<br>
<br>
Doing that for my gear takes a typical 868.21 DPS Auto:Steady rotation to 1114.92 DPS over 18 seconds. (I did not carefully watch different shot cool downs to optimize this, just a quick check of the ability to do analysis like this with the spreadsheet as it is now.) This ability is available in all shot rotations in the spreadsheet.<br>
<br>
You skip the first shot because I use it to close the timing loop for the whole rotation, and Rapid Fire has a 3 minute cool down, not something you want factored into the DPS calculations for this exercise.<br>

		<div id="post_message_566491">Cheeky, I've been able to modelise bursts with the hunter abilities using the method you explained and it works pretty well. However, there are still some burst effects that I cannot insert in the process. Do you think it would be possible to add custom burst effects somewhere or add the common burst effects such as bloodlust/heroism, haste potions, drums of battle, drums of war, ... ?<br>
<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Cheeky, I've been able to modelise bursts with the hunter abilities using the method you explained and it works pretty well. However, there are still some burst effects that I cannot insert in the process. Do you think it would be possible to add custom burst effects somewhere or add the common burst effects such as bloodlust/heroism, haste potions, drums of battle, drums of war, ... ?<br>
<br>

</div>For the effects you list, I'd add them as temporary haste through the hand-modifiable blue row on the 'Gear' tab. It's not ideal, but I really am avoiding having to add more abilities to manage in the Shot Rotations. It gets very complicated, very fast.<br>
<br>
If you can come up with a good model for the <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=21670"><span><span class="purplename">[Badge of the Swarmguard]</span></span></a>, I'll add it. But I don't have one to test out proc rates,  etc.</div>

First of all thanks Cheeky, the spreadsheet is awesome and has saved me so much time, effort, experimentation and gold.<br>

Now if i recall correctly serpent sting gets a damage bonus based on attack power, so proc trinkets like HotU,etc.. should increase the total damage of serpent sting. Does that make it worthy of inclusion into a shot rotation?<br>
<br>
(Not directed to Cheeky specifically) I'm survival/MM 41/20 and have been messing around with 1:1.5 macros but can't seem to get it to work properly. I know latency has some role to play, but the latency variations in the spreadsheet says i should be able to use a 1:1.5 since my latency averaged 300-500ms. As is now i'm choosing my shots manually and it does okay but i based on the discussions here a macro seems to be the way to go, so i want to get that working a.s.ap. Any ideas?</div>

</div>While the base damage is pretty decent, Serpent Sting only scales with 10% of your AP, the mana cost is pretty high and it cannot crit.  All together these make it inferior to all of your other options in a 1:1.5 rotation.</div>

And since you asked a question related to something that has been bothering me for awhile, I have a request, if possible, to unlock the spreadsheet (or parts of it) so that we could delete items from the dropdowns.

</div>1 - I don´t really mind. IMHO improving gear pre-70 to the extend of using your spreadsheet is overkill considering you´ll outgrow it pretty soon.<br>
2 - I actually like this feature a lot. In addition to my status-quo profile I do have a few other "wishlist" profiles. Wheras I can use the armory button for the former, I´d always have to hand input the others if it wasn´t for the import function. That beeing said if it´s only once between two specific versions I won´t complain - even less considering it´d take an efford of 8 hours on your side to do so. <!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I'm guessing you're wearing gear that, for some reason or another, isn't in the spreadsheets' data base. As Cheeky said, non hunter gear (ie Gorehowl, Hellreaver, etc that virtually no hunters use) or simply green quality items with hunter stats, that aren't in the spreadsheet because it's too much work to implement all the possible combinations. So, to put it more clearly, when you load one of those items from the armory, the spreadsheet won't identify it. That means you'll get an error, and since there is no matching entry for that gear slot, it should be displayed as empty.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Part of the problem is that the spreadsheet does a single load for all talents, but there are separate loads for each item, plus one more for the overall listing, with race, gems, etc. So if there is a short network problem you have a much higher likelihood of seeing it in the gear scrape.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_570566"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I've noticed this in the last 3 versions (and also found in the new 12/4 version) that <br>
Ranged Weapons which are (or should be) superior to the <a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28581" target="_blank">Wolfslayer Sniper Rifle</a> greatly reduce DPS totals<br>
with no reasonable explanation I can find.  I have to assume this is a bug, and I've<br>
read the last 6 pages of forums but didn't see any mention of the issue.<br>
<br>
For instance, if I were to upgrade my Wolfslayer Sniper Rifle for the <a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28772" target="_blank">Sunfury Bow of the Phoenix</a> or the <a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=34530" target="_blank">Vengeful Gladiator's Rifle</a> on the sheet, <br>
I would lose 14.66 or 6.95 DPS respectively.<br>
<br>
I realize my gear isn't much for anything outside of KZ but I don't know of any reason that additional<br>
damage &amp; +agi (in the case of the bow) should reduce.<br>
<br>
Just wanted to point out a bug now that I've researched enough that I think<br>
I know what I'm talking about.  As my luck is nil, please excuse me if this<br>
was discussed further back in the thread ... I apologize as I have missed any<br>
such mention.<br>
<br>
Hope this helps.  (Bnang of the Voodoo Gurus on Medivh if you would like to test with armory)<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_570582"><!-- google_ad_section_start --><b>Bnang</b>: Congratulations, you have re-discovered how critical weapon speed is to hunter DPS.  Without adding haste rating, the Wolfslayer does do better for a BM hunter than many other weapons with better stats, specifically because its shot speed is extremely close to 2.0 seconds after Serpent's Swiftness and quiver modifiers.  The fact that it removes just about all dead time from a shot rotation trumps the smaller incremental DPS gains you would get from stats or white damage on other weapons.  This has been well established and discussed to death in the BM theorycrafting thread.  This is not a bug in the spreadsheet.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
Checking the armory i've seen where the Wolfslayer i rated 9th overall and the sunfury is rated 5th overall (over TK, Hyjal and BT ranged weapons), the Vengeful gladiator weapons being next and Lady Vaj's bow at the top. Now i've been working the spreadsheet's shot rotations, etc.. and found that Wolfslayer still gives me a better overal dps even tho i'm Surv/MM so my question is simply this.. should i bother to try and get Sunfury or the bow from ZA? My guild is past Kara now, doing ZA and gruuls/SSC so if i want Sunfury i'm gonna have to get it on my own time. Is it worth the effort or just try and get to Vaj and squeeze her till her bow drops?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>The armory appears to rank the items based on their budget, the item level or "ilvl" and that's one of the things that breaks hunter damage.  The feature that leads to amazing BM hunter damage is haste because it reduces the cool-down time on auto shot.  The wolfslayer sniper rifle has just the right cool-down time that the BM spec's passive haste ends up with a very tight shot rotation that has very little (or zero) wasted time. Weapon speed is something that's not considered by the armory.<br>
<br>
Might as well wait on Vashj's bow.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Okay, i know this the debate between the Wolfslayer and Sunfury has been going on for a while now, and i honestly don't tant to add to it, i just want some feedback.<br>
<br>
Checking the armory i've seen where the Wolfslayer i rated 9th overall and the sunfury is rated 5th overall (over TK, Hyjal and BT ranged weapons), the Vengeful gladiator weapons being next and Lady Vaj's bow at the top. Now i've been working the spreadsheet's shot rotations, etc.. and found that Wolfslayer still gives me a better overal dps even tho i'm Surv/MM so my question is simply this.. should i bother to try and get Sunfury or the bow from ZA? My guild is past Kara now, doing ZA and gruuls/SSC so if i want Sunfury i'm gonna have to get it on my own time. Is it worth the effort or just try and get to Vaj and squeeze her till her bow drops?</div>

</div>Statistically your chances of getting Sunfury are far greater than Vashj bow. The gun from TK or ZA are not bad either. It's up to you to decide what/where you want to farm. As for the Armory ratings, I can assure you that the Illidan bow (among others) is better DPS for MM/Surv so take the armory with a grain of salt. Last but certainly not least, as a Surv/MM hunter you should not be seeing higher DPS from Wolfslayer over Sunfury. You may need to reconsider your shot rotations.</div>

		<div id="post_message_572134">Thanks for the feedback Kamaa... i reworked the shot rotations and realized the error in my thinking. Looking through the season 2 gear i realized the Merciless crossbow gives me a significant boost over Sunfury and Wolfslayer, so i guess i'll work on that for the time being until something better drops. Thanks again.<br>
<br>
Cheeky, with so much time being put into your spreadsheet, when do you find time to play... lol<br>
<br>
Edit<br>
Was playing around again and found that my Wrathtide (which has been parked in my bank for months) does more effective dps than the Wolfslayer. Made sure to rework the shot rotations and all... what gives?</div>

The chance to miss is not allowing for AH (which I believe affects LB in much the same way Ferocity affects it, which is to say, pet chance to hit and crit talents are not spell or physical exclusive); spreadsheet says 17% chance to miss, pet is missing consistently closer through the boss attempts (apart from attempt 12, where 20% misrate was observed) to 13%;<br>
<br>
Additionally, spreadsheet says average damage should be 133.25 with my 2344 rap. Full log average was 206, Kael attempt averages were consistently all over 200. The 4% hit and TBW use is not enough to cover this 133 vs 200+ differential, leading me to believe that the RAP -&gt; LB damage factor is inaccurate.<br>
<br>
Further supporting this theory was simple grinding on the eleganku plateau last night, where combat log normal LB hits (no TBW) were landing consistently between 160 and 190.

SSC / TE as survival spec, still with the serpent, with an average blow of 156, times miss rate (@ 17% miss) 129.5. Spreadsheet expected damage, with better gear plugged in than I had back on the 2nd (im pretty sure thats the run I picked up my T5 helm), gives an expected average of 102.5. AFAIK there is no special magic or nature vulnerability to be had across Leo, Vash (x2), Alar and VR, yet the actual damage being markedly higher than spreadsheet-crafted damage is consistent across all fights.</div>

		<div id="post_message_575862">Wind Serpents' LB in raids will do more damage than the spreadsheet says for a few definite reasons:<br>
* Misery - +5% magic damage debuff.  If you have a spriest, this is up 100% of the time.<br>
* Improved Divine Spirit - Most disc priests who take Divine Spirit also take Improved.  Wind serpents don't have a ton of base spirit, but it does increase their +dam a bit.<br>
* Totem of Wrath / Wrath of Air totem - +3% spell crit and +101 dam, respectively.  If you're in a elemental or some resto shaman group you likely have at least Wrath of Air.<br>
* Stormstrike - increases next direct nature damage spell by 20%.  If you have an enh shaman, two stacks of this are up every 10 seconds.<br>

</div>I'm guessing you're a beast master, and you used a 1:1 rotation. The results are then rather normal; Wolfslayer is just that good because it's a 2.7 speed. So, the wasted time between a steady and the subsequent autoshot is at a minimum. <br>
Get a good few haste items and plug the data in; Wolfslayer should now clip your autoshots, and Arcanite or Vengeful gladiator should outdps it constantly.<br>
<br>
EDIT: Wolfslayer is indeed 2.7 speed. Side effect of typing late at night. I'm editing my post accordingly. However, compared to 2.9 or 3.0 weapons, everything I stated still remains valid.</div>

May be Vengeful gladiator can outdps it if you add arcane shots for 1:1.3 rotation and to compensate for lower speed, but until I can prove it in spreadsheet, Wolfslayer is top DPS weapon for BM.<br>

		<div id="post_message_580255">So.. here's a question for heavy users of the spreadsheet, and perhaps Cheeky himself.<br>
<br>
How closely does your spreadsheet predicted DPS correspond to your real-world (WWS) DPS?<br>
<br>
I've been using the spreadsheet forever and mostly considering it a 'relative' measure -- X item is better than Y item, Z rotation is better than A rotation, etc.  It works great for that and I've checked over the math enough myself that I believe it when it tells me what's better.<br>
<br>
However, very consistently, the actual dps numbers have always been significantly above anything I've actually achieved.  Obviously part of this is fights with movement, or adds and target switching, or any of the other various things that make boss fights more interesting than the situation modeled by the sheet.  However, the latest series of updates have added a lot of things aimed at making the simulation more accurate (target armor, extra debuffs, etc), and the discrepancy still stands.<br>
<br>
Since the spreadsheet models a perfect rotation on a totally stationary target, I think it's a given it will provide somewhat inflated numbers.  The question is, how much inflated?  In my current gear and with minimum raid buffs, the sheet pegs me at 1600 DPS against a 7700 armor boss.  While in a few groups with awesome synergy I have topped 1400 or 1500 DPS, my typical dps is much more commonly around 1000-1200.  I'm well aware of the deficiencies of my cursed human hands and their faulty adherence to the ideal rotation and timing -- but is that enough to explain a 30% gap between expected and observed?<br>
<br>
So: a lot of excess verbiage aside, how closely does the spreadsheet model your actual DPS?</div>

</div>That's.. impressive.  Hmm.  I notice you have imp AotH but are not using a Dragonspine.  Maybe the spreadsheet's modeling of Dragonspine (or else my own issues with continuing to weave properly during random proc hastes) is to blame.<br>
<br>
I suppose the thing to do is test vs. a known target, e.g. Dr. Boom, where I can actually maintain the full rotation I have modeled in the sheet and see how close it gets.  If I really am pissing away 400+ DPS through inaccurate weaving that's something I need to look at.</div>

</div>This was posted a while back, but it's been nagging at the back of my mind. I don't believe you. Can you show a WWS to confirm this? I suspect if you even came close to the DPS theorized based on Cheeky's spreadsheet then it's due to things you didn't addd to the spreadsheet, ie blood lust and drums of battle.<br>
<br>
EDIT: My apologies if my doubt seems hostile, but the spreadsheet says I am capable of 1800 DPS and I'm hitting about 1600 tops. I haven't fought gorefiend, but I have had fights where I didn't have to take a single step against Rage Winterchill because he never targeted me once. I had to mend pet a couple times, but nothing serious. If you're able to be within 6 DPS of you spreadsheet, then I am doing something terribly wrong.</div>

		<div id="post_message_583447">Hi there, <br>
<br>
I've found the spreadsheet quite useful but I'd like some clarifications about it, hence this is why I'm posting. Hope somebody can help me out with this and maybe the OP can take some suggestions in consideration for the next versions of this nice tool:<br>
<br>
1) Rapid Fire: Am I wrong or rapid fire isn't accounted for in any way in the spreadsheet? I believe there should be a switch to consider its dps potential and to average out its power.<br>
2) Readiness: same as before, is it accounted in any way for dps potential? Ok, it doesn't do much, more or less 1 more rapid fire over five mins, but once you enable rapid fire calculations in the spreadsheet (which basically are already there), putting a switch for readiness shouldn't be that difficult<br>
3) Ferocious Inspiration: If I'm BM and I do have this talent it's dps potential is fully considered. Problem is if I'm surv and grouped with BM hunter (which is always the case for me), I believe there should be a switch in the hunter and pet buffs to account for it (and maybe for multiple stacks, ie in case of 3 bm hunters in same party)<br>
4) Heroism or Bloodlust: I believe it should be included in the buffs framework. Probably here you should consider switches to average out its potential, and maybe consider a further switch to average it out on a period inferior to its cooldown<br>
5) Improved Judgement of the Crusader: I don't see many retribution paladins around but maybe it should be considered to include as target debuff. Just to realize its dps potential or lack of <br>
6) Unleashed Rage: same as before, consider putting it under pet buffs<br>
7) Blood frenzy: same as before, consider putting it under hunter and pet buffs<br>
8) Curse of Shadows: I see there is no switch for 10% vs 13%; under calculations tab it is at 105% for arcane shot, is it that for real?<br>
<br>
If anybody knows more about this please let me know, thanks for reading anyway <br>
C ya<br>

Doh!  Missed that Q section of the calculations tab somehow! In all honesty, I had not checked this version thoroughly: I did a check on a previous version (don't remember which one), that I got of somewhere else...<br>

Still, blame's on me for not properly checking and following the formulas! <br>

</div>Perhaps it has, but none of the answers have helped me yet, unfortunately.<br>
<br>
1. Yes.<br>
2 - I have all macro support turned on, still doesn't work. Maybe there is some hard coded security or something in the work version of excel.<br>

If this question keeps coming up, perhaps a note in the Intro tab might be a good idea?</div>

</div>I would like to confirm this happens with my 2007 Excel, but no matter, I'll just use the old one.<br>
<br>
And also, for me the buttons do not change or look clickable when I try with 2007 Excel. I suspect this is a compatability issue with the versions. <br>
<br>
I can see now that this spreadsheet will be very handy for me, once I can use it fully. <br>
<br>
Thanks, <br>

</div>Well, if we assume that the proc has a 45sec internal cooldown. (which seems popular these days) The average passive AP bonus would be (10/45)*(160AP) = 35.55AP I believe. And in reality it'll be a bit less overall.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

May be some rotation sets be chosen from dropdown in case there will be more of them invented?<br>
I myself do not use 1:2, but would want to model claimed dps increases with this rotation.<br>

In tests 1:1.5 worked better for me on dr.Boom, but 1:2 was better than 1:1 with slow weapon, because 1:2 can be forced now to ignore latency.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_602551"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Well it depends, are you trying a Survival based spec? If so then haste effects will actually screw your dps based on a 1:1.5 shot roation. Haste effects are better for BM and MM hunters, which is why you almost never see a Surv spec with IAotH. For Surv hunters the slower your attack speed better, which is why 2.90-3.10 weapon speeds are preferred over 2.70 or less.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I can think of 2 reasons:<br>
<br>
- maybe you have to recalc your shot-rotation after selecting the new item<br>
<br>
- it may be, that the relatively low amount of haste that 1 single item grants you is too low, to result in a better rotation. On the other hand the higher petcrit on the beastmaw-pauldrons might result in a higher frenzy-uptime and therefore grant a not unsignificant higher pet-dps.

</div>Wow, that looks like some sort of major bug.<br>
<br>
Any chance I could get a listing of the values in the "Focus Regeneration" section on the 'Pet Calculations' tab shows?<br>
<br>
You should still have 24 - Base for 4, and Beastial Discipline and Go For the Throat should work out fine (Unless you have a negative crit rate, which should be impossible without hand adjusting a very big negative crit rating, but that breaks other sections of the spreadsheet too.) I think there must be something screwy there.<br>
<br>
Also, you have both Claw and Gore selected as abilities. I don't think that's possible on a single pet. That shouldn't be causing the problem either.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">You say you are using a 1:1-rotation? I can´t seem to find a reason for not using 1:1.5 as SV. You should normally be lacking 25 - 30 % of total shots compared to 1:1.5<br>
<br>
I also feel the autoshot-mechanic has somewhat changed but has it even become viable for SV-hunters to go 1:1?</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>Well its not a 1:1, but more like 1:2 as it shots 1 auto, then two steady without (!) delay between them before an autoshot again. So it actually clips your sutoshots, BUT it queue up the std to go without delay, so you increase you dps alot compared with a 1:1. It burns alot more mana, but the dps is worth it. But as I understand it, it isnt much of an dps increase for BM becasue of they very high speed, but for slower SV and MM its pretty good. Especially for when there is a CC up. Cant come close to its DPS with a auto, steady, arcane rotation. <br>

</div>Well I tried that, but you spreadsheet make a delay ( even if I set latency to 0 ) between the steadyshots. And thats the whole point of this new macro. It makes no delay between the steadyshots, it quese them up instead. Much like casters that set of the next cast just before the previous is done. So if you could make an option to remove the delay, I could set it up myself, but not as it is now.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_607018"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Yeah, I noticed that as well, but still. Look at the time between the shots. There isnt much wasted dps there since the steadyshots goes without delay. But still I agree it can be even better if the macro can be ran properly. I have read somewhere that if you remove the Kill Command from it, it should behave better, but havent come around to try it in a raid environment yet. But I think when I tried it at Dr. Boom it went more correct, but then the pet was inactive at my side.<br>
<br>
And that still out dps a auto, steady, arcane cast sequence makro... Constant dps, with no delays.<br>
<br>
Dont know if it is posiible to manually time these shots so fast an accurate than it can be recreated without macro. The cast sequence macro will casue delays, so that no good.<br>
Its a shame its so hard to be able to dps as hunter that human fingers and timing cant keep up. But the hardness of the class is maybee why so many of us still study and still enjoy it.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Found out the problem:<br>
<br>
If you forget to enter a shotrotation in the "quickshot" tab, then in the tab "pet calculations" F25 (=weightedshotpersecond) can become negative...<br>
<br>
with trinkets equiped I get the following:<br>
<br>
no quickshotrotation added: F25 = 0.69<br>
With quickshotrotation added: F25 = 1.08<br>
<br>
Without trinkets I get:<br>
<br>
no quickshotrotation added: F25 = -2.50<br>
With quickshotrotation added: F25 = 1.08<br>
<br>
Is the quickshot tab required to have a shotrotation added?<br>
<br>
Btw, I did remove the gore, didn't affect the calcs.<br>
<br>
If you need more info/screenshots, I can give them <br>
<br>
<br>
Edit: Blegh, I'm really crap with excel, sorry. The problem starts I think in B6 on the quickshotrotation tab. When no trinkets equiped and no shotrotation set, that number suddenly becomes -100. With 1 trinket equiped it becomes -50, 2 trinkets makes it 0 (all with no shotrotation set for quickshots).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Are you sure this is not just because of the way the servers now handle latency? Basically your display might show you are on GBC, but it might also be behind the server, so what you see is the GCD going off earlier when the reality might be that the server triggered the event before your display caught up. And would you not get better DPS using arcane and multi shot instead of that second steady shot? They do comparable damage on arcane and more on multi with the added benefit of not clipping auto shots.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Found out the problem:<br>
<br>
If you forget to enter a shotrotation in the "quickshot" tab, then in the tab "pet calculations" F25 (=weightedshotpersecond) can become negative...<br>
<br>
with trinkets equiped I get the following:<br>
<br>
no quickshotrotation added: F25 = 0.69<br>
With quickshotrotation added: F25 = 1.08<br>
<br>
Without trinkets I get:<br>
<br>
no quickshotrotation added: F25 = -2.50<br>
With quickshotrotation added: F25 = 1.08<br>
<br>
Is the quickshot tab required to have a shotrotation added?<br>
<br>
Btw, I did remove the gore, didn't affect the calcs.<br>
<br>
If you need more info/screenshots, I can give them <br>
<br>
<br>
Edit: Blegh, I'm really crap with excel, sorry. The problem starts I think in B6 on the quickshotrotation tab. When no trinkets equiped and no shotrotation set, that number suddenly becomes -100. With 1 trinket equiped it becomes -50, 2 trinkets makes it 0 (all with no shotrotation set for quickshots).</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>Ok, I figured this out. It's because I allow you to select trinket procs in the shot rotation (for things like the <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28288" target="_blank">[Abacus of Violent Odds]</a>) and your trinket name, "None", matches the selection of no shots.<br>
<br>
I'll correct this in the next release. Good find.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_607914"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Greetings,<br>
<br>
I have browsed through the different posts concerning Hunter theorycrafts, looking for a way of calculating how Mp5 translates into DPS, but haven't found it. I might have missed the answer somewhere...<br>
<br>
As I see it at the moment, using a 1:1 Steady rotation and with my own stuff:<br>
Mana cost: 99<br>
Average Damage:  564<br>
Average Crit Damage: 1201<br>
Average Crit chance: 24.50%<br>
Average Damage including crit: (564x75.5+1201x24.5)/100=720.06<br>
DPM: 720/99=7.27<br>
DPS: 720/1.5=480<br>
<br>
Since 1Mp5 means that we need 5 secs to gain 1Mana, I calculate this as DPM/5=7.27/5=1.45.<br>
It seems logical to me, but I might be looking in the wrong direction. Does anyone come with the same result or a different one? This is calculated with Steady Shot and doesn't include Kill Command for instance, which has a slightly lower DPM for me (around 6.50).<br>
<br>
I've gone through the spreadsheet and didn't see this value Mp5=DPS, so I thought that it might be interesting to add it there. The spreadsheet is a great tool, keep on the good work. <!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_608073"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->You can only translate mp5 to dps, when you would have gone oom without mp5.<br>
What is nearly never the case, if you are BM-specced.<br>
<br>
For MMs / SVs you have to calculate the dpm of each shot (or even rank).<br>
<br>
Example:<br>
With 0 mp5, you can only use Auto/Steady.<br>
With 30 mp5, you can add Multi Shot rank 1.<br>
With 60 mp5, you can add Arcane Shot rank 9.<br>
With 90 mp5, you can add KC.<br>
With 120 mp5, you can increase your Multi Shot's rank to 6.<br>
<br>
Now you have to calculate the DpM of every spell / rank.<br>
Let's say your Multi Shot rank 1 does 1k (average) damage with manacosts of 90.<br>
1000 / 81 = 11.1 DpM<br>
Your Arcane Shot may does around 800 damage and costs 230 mana:<br>
800 / 230 = 3.5 DpM<br>
KC does 300 damage , for 75 mana.<br>
300 / 75 = 3 DpM<br>
Increasing your Multi shot does 200 extra damage, for 117 additional mana.<br>
200 / 117 = 1.7 DpM<br>
<br>
<br>
So, the first 30 Mp5 will give you<br>
30 * 11.1 / 5 = 67 additional DpS.<br>
The next 30 Mp5 will give you<br>
30 * 3.5 / 5 = 21 additional DpS.<br>
<br>
30 * 3 / 5 = 18 DpS<br>
<br>
30 * 1.7 / 5 = 10 DpS<br>
<br>
As you can see, you can't determine the benefit of Mp5 easily.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>1 - Not at all here.  I feel any gear that wouldn't be used beyond Karazhan should be removed as there aren't as many options pre-Karazhan to really need the spreadsheet.  Not to mention the custom option os more then capable of handling any gear not listed.<br>
2 - I have not used the Import/Export feature but mostly because of the read from Armory feature.  However, I will probably start using it since the Armory seems to be unreliable at best.  <br>

</div>That sounds like a good idea. I am removing the set bonuses from D0, D1, T1, T2, T2.5, ZG, and AQ20 gear. I can't imagine any serious Hunter is still keeping those pieces for the set bonuses (or even equipping them at all.)<br>

It cleans up the gear lists a decent amount. Especially for the melee weapons.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_609578"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Change log:<br>
 - Added new items (Insignia of the Alliance, Insignia of the Horde, Ring of Ghoulish Delight, Void Sphere)<br>
 - Corrected some item stats (Bladed Shoulderpads of the Merciless, Crown of Cinders, Timelapse Shard, Vengeful Gladiator's Chain Helm)<br>
 - Started removing level 60 gear.<br>
 - Added in target resilience to all calculations.<br>
 - Added support for Resilience-based Chest enchants.<br>
 - Fixed bug with Improved Hunter's Mark debuff and pet AP.<br>
 - Provided a better model of Romulo's Poison Vial on-proc effect.<br>
 - Tried again to make it so the Armory returns English names for gear by default.<br>
 - Make it clearer on the Gear/Talents tab exactly which character is being read from the Armory<br>
 - Reworked layout of the 'Settings and Results' tab to put information in an easier to understand format.<br>
 - Default target to level 70. This will prevent roughly 5 messages a week from people complaining to me it is 0.6% off from their character sheet.<br>
 - Renamed Cruelty and Determination to Battlemaster's Cruelty and Battlemaster's Determination.<br>
 - Used Vaxum's model for the Band of the Eternal Champion proc effect.<br>
 - Fixed the Minor Haste enchant on Hands to be 10 haste rating.<br>
<br>
There is a new OO version as well.<br>
<br>
I have not made any changes to account for the screwy behavior being seen with GCDs starting early Client-side. Once we have a better handle on how to model that I can make changes to support it.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>You can set Custom target resilience on the 'Settings and Results' tab cell C34. Then select the Custom Target in cell A43. If you select a special target you get a raid boss who has 0 resilience. And because I'm extra nice, I brought you next year's version today. Be happy.<br>

</div>Whoops. That's a bug from my changing the layout of the 'Settings and Results' tab. I'll have that corrected in the next version. Kaelvanas is special because I didn't update him; the Armory said he hadn't been active in a while. I'll also change the layout to fit "Wind Serpent" in the pet name cell.<br>
<br>
<br>
More feedback about layout and ease-of-use is appreciated.</div>

Apparently you programmed this in Excel 2004 (according to the message I got), and the way it handles macros for some of your features is vastly different than Excel 2003 for some reason. So the Shot Rotation, DST, and another page or two become completely disabled. I was able to enter rotations by hand, but I do not know if it actually changed any of the calculations within the spread sheet. I do not believe there is anything you will ever be able to do to make your spread sheet work in 2003, short of reprogramming it entirely which would probably force you to lose features that '03 does not support. As such I wonder if it would be beneficial to add a note that the sheet does not work for that version of Excel just to squash any further issues.<br>

</div>Hmmm. MY home version of Excel (where I've done 90+% of the development) is Microsoft Excel 2002 (10.6834.6830) SP3. <u>Everything</u> works in that version. When I first converted from Open Office to Excel a year ago I used my work version which might have been 2004, I'm not entirely sure.<br>

<br>
Two things I noticed in the most recent spreadsheet, both minor.<br>
<br>
Under shoulders, the leather Sun-Gilded Shouldercaps are there with correct stats, but there is a typo in the name.  You have them as "Sun-Gilded ShouDLercaps" so when loading gear from the armory they are not recognized.  Not a big deal to manually select, but thought I'd mention it since it's a very simple fix.<br>
<br>
Also, as a poster noted above, Demon Stalker Shoulderguards seem to have disappeared from the list.<br>

		<div id="post_message_614576">Hey Cheeky, I don't know the inner workings of your spreadsheet so don't take this the wrong way..  But how hard would it be to add a page that would have a button for running the calculations of multiple different shot rotations for side-by-side comparison with the currently selected gear?  Even if all it did was the built-in ones.  The hardest thing for me at the moment is switching weapons and clicking through all the pages to set up shot rotations; I always seem to forget.<br>
<br>
On a side note:  Now that you set the target's level to 70 you might not get 5 questions a week asking why it's off from the character sheet, but you can bet you'll get 10 asking why the spreadsheet says they are hit capped when they "aren't,"  Since people are so used to seeing hit cap at 142.  I almost posted a bug, but before I did I checked your first release notes and saw the note.  </div>

<br>
I've just a couple of questions for you:<br>
1) Will you ever implement switches for Unleashed Rage (enhance shaman buff) and other buffs like Imp. Judgement of Crusader, Blood Frenzy and Ferocius Inspiration from other hunters? I'd especially like to see Unleashed rage to gauge how it buffs BM pets' dps.<br>
2) I see that Curse of shadows gives only 5% additional damage to arcane shot, is that correct? Does having it improved to 13% change anything?</div>

As I posted above, the problem is that the 'Custom Target Level' value is always used in the hit% calculations, even if you have selected a non-custom target, for example Morogrim Tidewalker.

According to Cheeky's spreadsheet I found out that WSS still do better than those superior bows. Is it the fact or theres smth wrong with your spreadsheet? I have been arguing with some hunter for a while about these weapons. <br>

I do understand that BM need faster weapon to fit in our Steady shot between auto shot. However, does item's tooltip DPS have more effect than weapon speed?<br>

Hit becomes vastly more valuable now. And this is with a base hit chance on level 73 mobs of 99.19%. And because of my miss rate, my other stats are depressed in value.

</div>Cheeky changed it from default level 73 mob to default level 70 mob just because SO many people asked all the time why their crit chance was lower than their paper-doll crit.  Now, I have a feeling there will be just as many people wondering why their hit % is at 100 even though they're not capped.  QQ.

<br>
Regarding the default level (I know, sore topic!).<br>
<br>
When you select a boss target, eg Azgalor (6200 armor), he remains a level 70 until you change the Custom Target's level. I checked to see if the armor of Azgalor/other bosses still works, and it does. It is just the level that sticks with the Custom Target even if the Custom Target isnt selected.<br>

		<div id="post_message_621451"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->When I add mp5 to gear, it works fine, like normal.  When I add Judgement of Wisdom to buffs, it works fine, like normal.  When I combine the two, weird things happen, in a sinergistic effect.<br>
<br>
For example:<br>
Given my gear set, base time to mana exhaustion is 118 sec.  <br>
If I add 40 mp5 to my base gear, TtME is 136 sec.  40 mp5 added about 18 seconds.<br>
If instead I add JoW to base, TtME is 308.  JoW added 190 sec.<br>
If I add 40 mp5 and JoW to base, TtME is 463 sec.  <br>
<br>
Thus, adding JoW to 40mp5 gives me an additional 327 sec, 70% more than JoW without 40mp5.  Likewise, adding 40 mp5 to JoW gives me an additional 155 sec, about 8.6 times as much as adding 40 mp5 gave me without JoW.<br>
<br>
Starting with JoW buff and base gear's TtME of 308:<br>
Adding 1 mp5 gives 2 sec to base TtME.<br>
Adding 2 mp5 gives 5 sec to base.<br>
Adding 10 mp5 gives 28 sec to base.<br>
<br>
If I turn off JoW buff, mp5 addition goes back to being linear.  With JoW up, adding mp5 to gear starts giving you exponentially increasing benefits.  I don't know where the multiplicative bonus for having both is coming from, but it seems like a clear bug to me.<br>
<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">When I add mp5 to gear, it works fine, like normal.  When I add Judgement of Wisdom to buffs, it works fine, like normal.  When I combine the two, weird things happen, in a sinergistic effect.<br>
<br>
For example:<br>
Given my gear set, base time to mana exhaustion is 118 sec.  <br>
If I add 40 mp5 to my base gear, TtME is 136 sec.  40 mp5 added about 18 seconds.<br>
If instead I add JoW to base, TtME is 308.  JoW added 190 sec.<br>
If I add 40 mp5 and JoW to base, TtME is 463 sec.  <br>
<br>
Thus, adding JoW to 40mp5 gives me an additional 327 sec, 70% more than JoW without 40mp5.  Likewise, adding 40 mp5 to JoW gives me an additional 155 sec, about 8.6 times as much as adding 40 mp5 gave me without JoW.<br>
<br>
Starting with JoW buff and base gear's TtME of 308:<br>
Adding 1 mp5 gives 2 sec to base TtME.<br>
Adding 2 mp5 gives 5 sec to base.<br>
Adding 10 mp5 gives 28 sec to base.<br>
<br>
If I turn off JoW buff, mp5 addition goes back to being linear.  With JoW up, adding mp5 to gear starts giving you exponentially increasing benefits.  I don't know where the multiplicative bonus for having both is coming from, but it seems like a clear bug to me.<br>
<br>
P.S.  Thanks so much for putting together this spreadsheet.  It's a fantastic resource.</div>

</div>I don´t have time to do complete maths on this one here at work, but just a quick thought: The TtME needs to scale exponentially. Think of the extreme: Your mp5 is the same as your mp5-usage, so your TtME is infinte. You won´t reach an infinite result in such a quick jump without an exponential function (as far as my mathematical understanding goes, you´ll never reach it with a linear function unless one of your variables has an infinite amount).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_621870"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Lactose, perhaps this should be discussed in another thread since this is only marginally about spreadsheets, but regarding your argument that the -66% hit debuff leads to evidence of a two-roll system, could it be that that particular effect jumps in after the roll rather than modifying your die roll by -66?<br>
<br>
In other words, what I'm arguing is not that we necessarily have a two-roll system, but perhaps rather that that debuff forces a second roll. I will grant you that a second roll <u>must</u> be happening in your scenario for there to be standard hits. But I'd like to see the results of someone with low chance to hit shooting a level 70 target for a long time -- long enough to be statistically significant -- and commenting on how closely their crit matches their expected crit. I will grant you, with only a maximum of 5% basic miss, it's going to be hard to get anything highly conclusive...but then, if it's that hard to be conclusive, then does it actually matter that much?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Right, thanks.  I knew I was missing something obvious.  The more MP5 you have, the longer you can keep your rotation going, the longer the period of time that you get benefits from MP5 without running dry, the more of a benefit MP5 is for you, etc.  So while mana regen over time stays linear, TtME is exponentially increasing with mana regen.  <br>
<br>
Thanks for letting me realize the obvious.  Clearly the lesson here is that I shouldn't theorycraft late at night on too little sleep.  And yet, is it just me, or is that when everyone does most of their theorycrafting?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div><br>
Is there a way to get the spreadsheet to show less then 100% so the appropriate dmg is reflected for being under cap against a 73 mob?<br>
<br>
I tried setting the Custom level to 73 and selecting Custom target.  I tried selecting a specific boss, "High Warlord Najentus."  Both of these have no affect on the hit %?  Is the idea here to just give a representation of what the character sheet will say?  Because honestly I could care less about what the game will tell me.  I'd log in if I wanted to see that.  ;-P<br>
<br>
Again Cheeky I think your work as great as you have seen in my previous posts!  I just want to know what I can expect or how to get what I am looking for.<br>
<br>
Edit: I am not sure why.. but I downloaded the Excel sheet again named it something else.. exported from the one giving me problems and imported to the new one.. and now the level on the settings page seems to affect the hit again.  If I can figure out how to recreate the problem I will let you know!<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Do you then also believe for example Surefooted (which is using the <b>exact</b> same spell effect, not just a similarily worded one, which works on someone else than its target) is on a second roll?<br>
 <br>
Edit: This is also ignoring all the testing that was made for rogues and specials being on a 2-roll system. They used (if memory serves) Ink Spray and Dust Cloud, both using the exact same spell effect as Banshee Curse, with lots of data supporting the 2-roll theory.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Change Log:<br>
 - Added in new gear (<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=29084" target="_blank">[Demon Stalker Shoulderguards]</a>, <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=34256" target="_blank">[Charmed Amani Jewel]</a>)<br>
 - Fixed a bug with how pet specials factored into Ferocious Inspiration uptime.<br>
 - Changed Hunter attacks to a 2-roll system, where hit and crit are determined separately.<br>
 - Made very clear in Hit/Crit chances what the target level is.<br>
 - Changed default target level back to 73. There are just as many people who couldn't figure out why their hit changed from previous versions as there were people who didn't know where 0.6% of their crit went.<br>
 - Corrected some item names (<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33298" target="_blank">[Prowler's Strikeblade]</a>, <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=27995" target="_blank">[Sun-Gilded Shouldercaps]</a>).<br>
 - Fixed the bug where the Rotation for different profiles wasn't being saved properly (display in 'Settings and Results' bug only.)<br>
 - Corrected some item stats (<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28331" target="_blank">[Gladiator's Chain Helm]</a>).<br>

		<div id="post_message_623160"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Looks like there´s a bug with critical hit damage calculations now.<br>
<br>
On the calculations tab for auto shot where it used to be 236,90% with version 40 it says 133,90% now (same crit chance of 36,40%). Also the Crit/Miss Adjustments went down from 149,34% to 111,84%.<br>

<br>
edit: included some screenshots for better illustration. This also affects Steady Shot and Multi Shot but whereas it´s a hit of over 200 DPS for auto shot it´s less than 9 dps for Steady and Multi. I guess this is propably somehow related to the changes for the 2 roll system that differs between white and yellow hits.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Could you tell us what kind of 2-roll system you're using Cheeky?<br>
<br>
A small nit-pick I had is that we all seemed to assume that if a single-roll system is discounted we'd be left with a "first roll for hit/miss, then roll for hit/crit" system. While agree that that's the most likely alternative to the 1 roll system, all that Lactose's recent test with the banshee showed is that we're not working with a 1 roll-system, not that we're actually working with a 2-roll system (e.g. blocks could be on a 3rd roll) or if we are, what kind of 2-roll system, since the rolls could for instance be "roll for hit/crit, if hit roll for hit/miss" (and unless I'm misunderstanding, that would again change the relative values of hit/crit).<br>
<br>
Again, I think it's a safe assumption that if it's 2-roll it'll be roll for hit, if hit roll for crit, and just to be complete I'll probably go test that when I get a spare few hours, but stating what model you went with is probably good for the spreadsheet. And afaik we still don't know when the roll for blocks happens in the 2-roll system (edit: although for your dps simulation blocks aren't relevant).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I compute both simulatenously, as I did before. I just use slightly different equations. The order of the rolls is independant, just whether or not a single roll is used is important. Here is an example using 95% hit rate, 30% crit rate, +130% crit bonus:<br>
<br>
1-roll - (2.3 * 0.3) + (0.95 - 0.3) = 134% damage increase.<br>
2-roll - ((1.3 * 0.3) + 1) * 0.95 = 132% damage increase.<br>
<br>
Where hit = 100% they are even:<br>
1-roll - (2.3 * .3) + (1.0 - .3) = 139%<br>
2-roll - ((1.3 * 0.3) + 1) * 1 = 139%<br>
<br>
Deatiled testing of above, 100 attacks for 100 damage each:<br>
2-roll, 30 crit for 230, 65 hit for 100, 5 miss for 0 - 134 average damage<br>
1-roll, 5 miss for 0 damage, 28.5 crit for 230, 66.5 hit for 100 - 132.05 average damage<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>This could be a side effect of the order effects are applied when generating an attack table.<br>
<br>
For instance (this is just an example):<br>
<br>
Base table + talent modifiers + gear modifiers + self buff/debuff modifiers = Your attack table.<br>
<br>
To keep the amount of computation down, this is only calculated when one of the above things changes, not on every for every attack.<br>
<br>
On each attack, your final attack table could be computed by adding your table with an opponent defense table, which could consist of the same stuff, talents, gear, buffs/debuffs.<br>
<br>
<b>If things are actually calculated this way</b> then you can have talents of your target overriding your gear.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I haven't seen a solid mathematical model for it yet, and have had some difficulty coming up with one that fits all the logs I've seen myself. I think there is a heavy random factor (either latency or the jitter in combat logs and how fast you can spam the macro) that is a large component to the way the macro behaves.<br>
<br>
If you have a suitable model, post it here and I'll see if I can get it incorporated.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_625875"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->So I've taken a stab at the new macro and how to model it.<br>
<br>
During my investigations I discovered something no one had been talking about, but which is part of why the macro works like it does. Auto Shot's cast speed is not 0.5s in practice. I analyzed almost 100 times when chained Steady Shots would clip an Auto and measured the time between the last Steady Shot and the Auto Shot. I understand there is jitter in the combat logs, so I'm hoping the sample size is enough to draw some conclusions. Here are the results:<br>
<br>
1 - 70 of the 96 test cases showed a difference under 0.5s. 26 showed over.<br>
2 - Over <u>all</u> test cases there was an average of 0.44823s between Auto and the previous Steady.<br>
3 - This works out to an 11.55% haste effect over the tooltip 0.5s cast time.<br>
<br>
Using that data, and what we've seen regarding client-only GCD, I've modified the Shot Rotation matrix as follows:<br>
1 - Latency is no longer added to Steady Shot cast time.<br>
2 - If the shot previous to a GCD-using shot was an Auto Shot, I readjust the GCD start to be the greater of previous GCD or previous Auto Shot cast time + latency.<br>
3 - Auto Shot's cast time is adjusted by the 11.55% haste factor I've found above.<br>
<br>
With those changes to both the regular Shot Rotation and Quick Shots I also added 2 new "Steady Spam" buttons. These check Auto vs. Steady cooldowns for each shot and pick whatever is next.<br>
<br>
Doing all that, using a 0.15s latency and my gear, led to the following DPS totals (Hunter only):<br>
<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30105" target="_blank">[Serpent Spine Longbow]</a> - 827 DPS, 17:33 Auto:Steady in regular, 22:28 in QS<br>
<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28772" target="_blank">[Sunfury Bow of the Phoenix]</a> - 863 DPS, 20:30, 23:27<br>
<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28504" target="_blank">[Steelhawk Crossbow]</a> - 840 DPS, 20:30, 24:26<br>
<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28581" target="_blank">[Wolfslayer Sniper Rifle]</a> - 847 DPS, 20:30, 25:25<br>
<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30724" target="_blank">[Barrel-Blade Longrifle]</a> - 848 DPS, 22:28, 25:25<br>
<br>
If this holds true (see caveats below) then the sweet spot of weapon speed seems to be about 2.9s. This also seems to be what the anecdotal evidence is saying. We may still be weapon speed dependant, just on a different, much more narrow speed now.<br>
<br>
Caveats:<br>
0 - This was a modified version 40 of the spreadsheet, it was only to look at timings.<br>
1 - We need much more testing under different constant haste effects to determine exactly how Auto Shot's cast time is modified.<br>
2 - With jitter in latency, it will be almost impossible to ever model this in a way that can be replicated consistently in game. I saw variances in Auto Shot cast time from 0.17 - 0.8s.<br>
3 - <b>This whole mechanic is so fucking stupid I'm seriously thinking about giving up on modeling Hunters</b>. I can't for the life of me figure out how any of this is "working as intended" and I really wish Blizzard would at least give us some indication of what they'd like our mechanics to be.<br>
4 - I could be completetly wrong about all of this, but it's the only model I've been able to come up with that fits the facts I've seen. The logs with 4-5 Steady chains still worry me, and it may be related to a small window for clobbering available right before an Auto Shot is cast (maybe the time between the 0.5s base cast time and the hasted time?)<br>
<br>
If we get some concensus on whether or not this model is sound I can release it. I hope to provide a spreadsheet of the Auto Shot data I collected later tonight.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I haven't done testing myself, but going with 0/5 Serpent's Swiftness and no quiver is the next logical step. In PMs Lactose suggested the range to mob (i.e. flight time) may be being applied to one shot and not the other, this would also complicate things, as well as make it completely un-modelable.<br>

Two:   re #3,  Amen I spent an hour on the phone bitching to my friend (who doesnt even play WoW) about how this would be nice.  And that I am not saying, tell me what gear and what macro, but explain to me how we are mechanicaly supposed to be doing DPS. and how we are supposed to actually achieve that.<br>

Three: thanks for the 2 roll system, now I can get a better grasp on effects of losing +hit,  With my current gear, it seems I should replace my survival favortie yellow (4agi 4 hit) with 8hit.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
I have two questions regarding your spreadsheet (version 42):<br>
<br>
1.) Currently specced standard raid BM, I am thinking of respeccing to survival where I'd like to use 'auto/steady/steady' rotation. Any chance you want to add this type of rotation into your spreadsheet? I had a chance to try this on the last PTR for about 2 hours on Dr. Boom. In my tests I was able to consistently beat my BM dps by a substantial amount (naturally not factoring in the pet damage nor the FI buff). I was going to run few more tests to record the numbers, but they brought down the PTR before I was able to do so. From memory, I believe the DPS difference between BM with auto/steady rotation and Survival with auto/steady/steady rotation was bout 100-150.<br>
<br>
2.) I am not certain your spreadsheet works correctly to account for the thundering skyfire diamond. When I load my current gear, the difference in the reported dps with and without this metagem equipped is only about 1.5 dps, which seems to be rather low. What I find interesting is that with or without the metagem equipped, the shot rotation tab claims that the 50 shots are fired in the same time period.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

From memory, I believe the DPS difference between BM with auto/steady rotation and Survival with auto/steady/steady rotation was bout 100-150.<br>
<br>
2.) I am not certain your spreadsheet works correctly to account for the thundering skyfire diamond. When I load my current gear, the difference in the reported dps with and without this metagem equipped is only about 1.5 dps, which seems to be rather low. What I find interesting is that with or without the metagem equipped, the shot rotation tab claims that the 50 shots are fired in the same time period.</div>

</div>Cheeky, thanks for the quick reply.<br>
<br>
1.) I think you are referring to the post where you mention trying to model the new macro? I guess by modeling that you would in effect handle the auto/steady/steady rotation for gear/specs where effective weapon speed was above certain threshold, e.g. MM or Surv builds.<br>
<br>
2.) Is it more difficult to model <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32410" target="_blank">[Thundering Skyfire Diamond]</a> than IAoH or DST?<br>
<br>
In any case, what do you think about these approximations/calculations (assuming pure auto/steady rotation with a BM build):<br>
<br>
With no metagem your spreadsheet reports (using some random gear and AS/SS rotation):<br>
hunter dps: 806.55<br>
<br>
If I equip <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32409" target="_blank">[Relentless Earthstorm Diamond]</a> your spreadsheet reports (with the same gear &amp; rotation):<br>
hunter dps: 818.25<br>
<br>
If I equip <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32410" target="_blank">[Thundering Skyfire Diamond]</a>:<br>
I do the following calculations (for simple auto/steady rotation):<br>
240 haste rating --&gt; 240/15.7 ~= 15.3% faster attacks for 6 seconds<br>
Assuming 1ppm, or approx. 10% uptime, you could say it averages out to about 1.53% faster attacks<br>
That in turn (again, assuming AS/SS rotation) is about 1.53% extra dps<br>
That would mean, hunter dps should be: 1.0153 * 806.55 = 818.89<br>
<br>
Do you think I signifficantly oversimplified anything?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_626861">I also did som testing on Dr. Boom. I focused on number of shot fired, instead of DPS, because I find it more clear and not luck (crit) based. What I did was this: I was counting the number of Auto Shots and Steady Shots fired during the 2 minute period, while changing the haste rating for each test. I also did it with the new 3:2 macro and with AotV and only with Leggionkiller (base speed 2.9)<br>
<br>
My discoveries:<br>
1, The number of Steady Shots was always the same, no matter if my haste rating was 0 or 95 (or between these numbers).<br>
2, The number of Auto Shots varied based on haste, but in very small chunks i.e. with 95 haste (1.98 attack speed, instead of 2.1) and period of 2 minutes, it fired like 2-3 more Auto Shots. (The number of Auto Shot might also be influenced by latency, which at the time of testing was ~150 ms)<br>
<br>
So my <i>personal</i> conlusion is that with new 3:2 macro, haste rating is not as good as for example crit (which is often lacking the haste items), because it only affects 1/3 of your shots. I think it also affects SS, but you need more like 95 haste.<br>
<br>
I'm going to do some more testing with improved AotH and report my findings.</div>

</div>In reality all the new macro results in is a Steady Shot spam. Most of it is just garbage, but what it tries to do is cast Steady Shot as often as possible, and let Auto Shots fire when they can in between chains. A lot of people see the pattern Auto, Steady, Steady, Auto, Steady (repeat), yielding 3 Steady Shots for every 2 Auto Shots.<br>
<br>
In pouring over logs I think this only really works because latency isn't constant, and anytime it increases you have a greater chance of getting an Auto Shot through. The GCD on the client prevents lowering latency spikes from providing much of an effect.</div>

</div>It all depends on your hasted weapon speed.  For the macro to really shine your steady shot has to finish casting in the 0.5s auto shot window, or pretty well near it.<br>
<br>
In my case it looks like I'm able to tune my weapon speed so I fire about 1.16 Steady Shots per Auto.  I've been able to increase my rate of fire to 1.25 shots per second (up from 1.1).<br>
<br>
Also a larger proportion of my shots are steady shots, which overall do much more damage (T6) and increase the value of my Ashtongue Talisman.</div>

</div>I did some testing yesterday, but didn´t have the time to look closer at the logs yet.<br>
What I did was buying 1000 cheap Arrows/Bullets. I wrote a very simple macro.<br>

		text-align: left;
		overflow: auto">/cast !Auto Shot
/cast Steady Shot</pre>
</div>I then proceeded to spam this macro at Dr. Boom until either he died or I run oom. I repeated this until I´ve used up all my ammo so I should have a sample size of exactly 1000 shots. I did this with a 3.0 weapon as well as with a 2.6 weapon both with and without quiver haste. I´m planning on doing the same again with 5/5 SS. I used my G15 keyboard to spam the macro in 50ms intervals. My latency should have always been well below 100ms on an average 50ms too.<br>
<br>

It should be pretty easy considering you got all items in the sheet already...it would be even better then then the Shadowpanthers one, because you can sort the armor chart (based on the "weigth" of each attribute) each time you change gear.</div>

</div>Yes you are exactly right, keeping up 1:1.5 is impossible without clipping. Cycle Time increases when I manually put it in but DPS jumps by a considerable amount.  <br>

</div>No problem. I didn't build in enough intelligence to the rotation-generation code to weigh clip time vs. DPS increase. Always feel free to hand build rotations when you think you have a better pattern.</div>

		<div id="post_message_629890">Once again to Cheeky (and whoever else helps him), this spreadsheet is amazing.<br>
<br>
I was using the spreadsheet this morning at work for a while, and thought of a couple things that might be handy in future versions. I dont know how hard/easy this stuff is, just throwing the ideas out in the open incase they didnt cross your mind!<br>
<br>
1) On the gear selection tab, have a cell next to each item that shows that particular items 'worth' in dps. Just something simple like:<br>
<br>
worth = (total dps with the item equipped) minus (total dps without item equipped).<br>
<br>
Sure its uses are a little limited, but I think it would be interesting seeing how different slots worth varies. And also for comparing rings/trinkets on the fly.<br>
<br>
2) When I make gear changes and compare the hunter/total dps, it would be great to be able to undo and redo (ctrl-z ctrl-shift-z). Maybe it's just my version of excel (2007), but I have trouble undoing changes to gear tabs.<br>
<br>
3) Now this is just pure laziness on my part: how hard is it to have auto-complete for typing in gear slots? The style where the dropdown list pops down and selects the closest thing to what you're typing. Scrolling up and down from Band of Eternal Champion to Stormrage Ring/Signet Ring of Primal to compare dps with different hit values ftl! This situation would also be nice with the undo/redo feature. Again, this might just be an Excel version issue (or a user issue).<br>
<br>
4) The spreadsheet needs to make me a coffee in the morning and bring me drinks to my PC while raiding.</div>

<br>
I've been a long time reader on this thread. The spreadsheet is amazing. Keep up the great work! I did have a question. From version 40 to 42 somehow i lost, misplaced, however you'd like to call it.. about 50 overall DPS. I have everything imported properly. I checked all my settings, and re-checked them. I have my target set to Gruul most times for max armor and resilience. Feel free to check my armory profile. I'm just wondering if the dps loss was purely from the 2 roll change or if i missed something new?</div>

</div>It worked as a reduction. I was using the frequency of specials at 1/X, where X was the time between them. I needed to be using X itself as the value. (So instead of you getting a special every 1.5 seconds in a focus-flooded situation, it was every 0.67 seconds, resulting in more chances to proc per period.)</div>

</div>Heh, reminds me of that bloke on Letterman that made a portable robotic fridge that would sense where you are (via a remote I guess), navigate to you, then throw your favourite canned beverage to you, upwards of 5 metres away.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I just thought of another feature to keep you busy!<br>
<br>
On the gear tab, at the top it has crit and hit chance (for level 73 default, which I love). Any chance of making the hit chance go above 100% when you are over the cap? Just to know at a glance how much over you are.</div>

<br>
Average time between auto shots: 337 ms<br>
Minimum time between auto shots: 225 ms<br>
Maximum time between auto shots: 516 ms<br>
<br>
There is latency jitter in the log of course so not much should be read into the fact that the average is below .38 and the minimum is .225.  I'm not actually sure what this means for (what we think is) a 0.5s hidden cast time on the server.  I am leaning more towards it being something controlled on the client and relating more towards animation than anything else.</div>

It should be pretty easy considering you got all items in the sheet already...it would be even better then then the Shadowpanthers one, because you can sort the armor chart (based on the "weigth" of each attribute) each time you change gear.</div>

</div>There is already a tool available which will do this for you. All you have to do is take the relative DPS of adding 1 of each stat from the table on the top of the results tab and plug them in at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080211131250/http://www.lootrank.com/wow/rank.asp" target="_blank">Lootrank</a>, and it will display a list of the top items available for you in each slot based on those stat weightings. One other nice thing it does for you, is it will also show you the optimal way to socket the item (not taking into account metas) and lets you know whether it would be more beneficial for you to get the socket bonus, or break it.<br>

</div>Just wanted to thank you for making that change.  I liked the matrix when you had it there, and it took me a minute to realize that this had replaced it, but the way you have it displayed now is great.  It's nice to be able to plug in those numbers for an item, be able to look at them side by side, and say that one item would be a 2.39 DPS upgrade over the other.<br>
 <br>
The work you, and the other contributors to the spreadsheet, put in is very much appreciated.</div>

		<div id="post_message_632101">As promised earlier this thread I did some tests with the new supposedly 3:2 shot rotation macro.<br>
<br>
<u><b>Used testing procedure:</b></u><br>
<br>
I bought 1000 arrows/bullets to limit every test to exactly 1000 shots. I then used my G15 Keyboard to spam the testmacro in 0,05s intervals shooting at Dr. Boom until either<br>
a) I was oom in which case I stopped shooting before any delay due to a lack of mana would occur or<br>
b) Dr. Boom died<br>
I repeated this until I run out of ammo. I run those tests with 2 diffrent specs, 2 diffrent weapons, with and without quiver haste for a total of 8 diffrent attack speeds.<br>
<br>

<u><b>A few conclusions that jump to my mind:</b></u><br>
<br>
- For the macro to be spammable the GCD needs to be longer than the actual steady shot casttime (e.g. you need at least quiverhaste) so the auto shot gets some leeway to be cast. This should be a non-issue for any hunter.<br>
- Five of the eight test series produced an almost perfect 3:2 rotation and a near perfect 1,5s average steady delay too. Depending on haste Auto shot is clipped between about 0,4s and 1,0s on those rotations though.<br>
- Haste doesn´t seem to have much of an impact on those 3:2 rotations. The average overall shot throughput is almost the same for all of them with faster attack speeds just clipping auto shot more than slow weapons. This favors slow weapons over fast ones for absolute damage.</div>

<br>
<u>DPS Calculation</u><br>
The Average Steadyshot and Autoshot are my average values from the Calculation's page of Cheeky's spreadysheet, with my normal hasted/unhasted gear, with full raid buffs and target debuffs. I use them to calculate to total damage based on the number of shots in each test, get the dps time figure from the WWS summary page (which seems to be the time between first and last attack), and hence get DPS.<br>
<br>
For the average values I had <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28034"><span><span class="bluename">[Hourglass of the Unraveller]</span></span></a> equipped instead of <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32487"><span><span class="purplename">[Ashtongue Talisman of Swiftness]</span></span></a>, since I'm not sure how that would affect the average damages on the spreadsheet, while hourglass would affect both auto and steady equally. In-game the Ashtongue would probably benefit more from the 3:2 rotations?<br>
<br>
<u>Conclusions</u><br>
Not a lot to conclude. I was surprised that hasted 3:2 came out on top for me, since it has a worse ratio (1.6) than unhasted (2.0). Apparently it fires those shots in much less time (140s instead of 150+ for all the other rotations) which gives it a big dps gain. I'm actually fairly pleased that hasted works out better both for 1:1 and 3:2 though, since it means i can switch from one to the other mid-fight.<br>
<br>
I need to test 3:2 hasted again I think, i'm surprised at how much less time it took (if you can see anything wrong with the 4th combat log above, please tell me).</div>

		<div id="post_message_633575">I've heard many conflicting statements about the value of armor penetration.  Does the DPS increase from armor penetration scale linearly or not?  I know that the amount of mitigation is not linear, as 5000 armor is around 32.1% mitigation, where 10000 is only around 48.6%.  But according to tank theory, every point of armor is as valuable as the preceding one.  10k health, and are taking 1000 base physical DPS, then you would live<br>
<br>
0 armor:  10.0 seconds<br>
5000 armor 14.7 seconds (+4.7 seconds)<br>
10000 armor 19.4 seconds (+4.7 seconds)<br>
15000 armor 24.2 second (+4.8 seconds)<br>
<br>
Shouldn't this work the same way for bosses too?  But almost everything I had seen people say about armor pen suggests that it gets more valuable, either as you get more pen, or when fighting bosses with less armor.  I think I even saw Cheeky suggest that 600 armor pen every 20 seconds was better than 100 armor pen constantly.  Is everyone just misinformed, or does boss armor work differently than player's armor?</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I've heard many conflicting statements about the value of armor penetration.  Does the DPS increase from armor penetration scale linearly or not?  I know that the amount of mitigation is not linear, as 5000 armor is around 32.1% mitigation, where 10000 is only around 48.6%.  But according to tank theory, every point of armor is as valuable as the preceding one.  10k health, and are taking 1000 base physical DPS, then you would live<br>
<br>
0 armor:  10.0 seconds<br>
5000 armor 14.7 seconds (+4.7 seconds)<br>
10000 armor 19.4 seconds (+4.7 seconds)<br>
15000 armor 24.2 second (+4.8 seconds)<br>
<br>
Shouldn't this work the same way for bosses too?  But almost everything I had seen people say about armor pen suggests that it gets more valuable, either as you get more pen, or when fighting bosses with less armor.  I think I even saw Cheeky suggest that 600 armor pen every 20 seconds was better than 100 armor pen constantly.  Is everyone just misinformed, or does boss armor work differently than player's armor?</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>The value for tanks results of the relation to how much damage they get before and how much afterwards. A detailed explanation can be found here <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080214022649/http://elitistjerks.com/f31/t18771-protection_warrior/" target="_blank">The Protection Warrior</a> but basically it comes down to this:<br>
<br>
You take a pre-armor hit of 10.000<br>
10 % Armor will reduce it to 9.000 (mitigating 1.000 points of damage) providing 10 % mitigation.<br>
If you reduce your damage bye another 1.000 you need more armor than before but you also get more than 10 % further mitigation (11,11 % to be exact).<br>
<br>
So while needing more armor to get further mitigation you also get a greater relative benefit. That´s the reason why the dimishing returns on armor for tanks - while still existing - are not that high as one might think on first sight.<br>
<br>
However, for damage dealers you can´t apply the same rationality. In fact, the system turns upside-down if you are the one who has armor penetration since every further point of ArP provides roughly the same relative damage-gain the absolute damage-gain will be higher.<br>
<br>
So basically it´s a matter of whether relative or absolute values are the ones that are of interest for you.</div>

</div>No. Only the last test produced a 3:2 rotation. For 1000 shots at a 3:2 rotation, the target is 600 steadies to 400 autos. You have 2 series that are obviously broken, 5 that have ~333 autos and ~667 steadies, and 1 that has ~400 autos and ~600 steadies. The 5 that you refer to are actually a 2:1 steady:auto rotation.</div>

</div>Actually, one can imagine different 2 rolls systems.<br>
The one you use is most likely the one Blizzard use, but here is a "Crits dont miss" 2-roll system, with different results : <br>
 - roll for crit or normal.<br>
 - Crits always hit. If normal, roll for hit or miss.<br>
<br>
If crit and hit are your crits and hits "paperdoll corrected" values (meaning that they are the character sheet ones, corrected by defense/ level /etc, except the roll system), then this systems leads to Crit chance of critical strikes, Hit*(1-Crit) chances of hit, and (1-Hit)*(1-Crit) chances of miss.<br>
<br>
The 2-roll system you use leads to Hit*Crit chances of critical, Hit*(1-Crit) chances of hit and (1-Hit) chances of miss.<br>
<br>
The old 1-roll system just gave the Crit, Hit-Crit and (1-Hit) probability.<br>
<br>
It is cleary weird, but it is possible to have a different 2-roll system, and I've not always been able to understand blizzard logic (why is the amno dps replaced by a fixed bonus in steady-shot ???).<br>
<br>
The good point is that with a little more datas like the one Lactose provided to move to 2-roll system, it will be quite easy to find which system is accurate, since Hit and Crit "paperdoll" probability are far away from 0 and 1.</div>

</div>It seems like relative gains should be the only ones of interest.  Obviously against bosses with lower armor, the raw DPS gain for any amount of armor pen higher than they are on bosses with high armor.  But I don't think that matters at all, because the percentage increase would be the same with 1000 armor pen whether you are facing a boss with a net 1000 armor, or one with 9999 armor.  If you have enough armor pen to increase your damage by 10% it doesn't really matter whether you are doing 1000 DPS to a higher armor boss, or 2000 DPS to a low armor boss, it's still just 10%.  Against the low armor bosses any increase in stats would produce a higher DPS increase than they would against high armor targets.<br>
<br>
So to me it seems like every point of armor pen should have the same value, no matter how much or how little you have it,  unless of course you get targets down to zero armor.</div>

</div>Basically this seems convenient but keep in mind that diminishing returns on armor do exist, they are simply not as high as one would assume on first sight. Hence there is also a bigger benefit from more ArP/low Armor bosses. For exact calculation concerning this please consult the above linked Warrior-Thread (though, the calculation found there naturally uses a tank-PoV).<br>
<br>
However, there is also the case that AP or Crit scales to another proportion at given amounts of armor than ArP therefore making not only the relative- but also the absolute-value interesting. For this Cheekys Spreadsheet provides quite useful answers.</div>

		<div id="post_message_635286">With all the new gear in 2.4 I'm thinking of releasing a new version tonight.<br>
<br>
Only problem is I'm still not 100% satisfied with my model of the 3:2 (Steady Spam) rotation yet, so I'm going to leave that out.<br>
<br>
Here is what is done:<br>
 - Change Band of the Eternal Champion proc duration to 10 seconds.<br>
 - Corrected some bugs in the profiles matrix. Everything should display accurately now.<br>
 - Corrected Draenei base Intelligence to 78 (from 82.)<br>
 - Corrected some item stats (Embrace of the Twisting Nether, Bow-Stitched Leggings)<br>
 - Fixed a bug in Shoulder socket bonuses that was sometimes showing bonuses for gear that did not have sockets.<br>
 - Corrected some item name spellings (Ancient Draenei War Talisman, Wicked Flame Spessarite)<br>
 - Remodeled Mark of Conquest with a 17 second internal cooldown and 13% chance to proc. This is based on data collected by Xeno of Suramar.<br>
 - If you select Thor'idal, the Stars' Fury as a ranged weapon the ammo is defaulted to None. (This is not applicable for OO versions.)<br>
 - Added new gear (Thor'idal, the Stars' Fury, Blackened Naruu Sliver, Apolyon, the Soul-render, Fang of Kalecgos, Muramasa, Crus of the Apocalypse, Shiv of Exsanguination, Hard Khorium Choker, Shoulderpads of the Silvermoon Retainer, Breeching Comet, Edge of Opression, Sunrage Shoulderpads, Hauberk of the Warbringer, Bladed Chaos Tunic, Leggings of the Immortal Night, Shoulderpads of Vehemence, Duplicitous Guise, Truestrike Crossbow, Bombardier's Blade, The Sunbreaker, Shattered Sun Pendant of Might, Gronnstalker's Belt, Gronnstalker's Bracers, Gronnstalker's Boots, Fletcher's Gloves of the Phoenix, Embrace of the Phoenix).<br>
 - Provide for three Buff Profiles. These are Loaded/Saved on the 'Buffs' tab, the names are controlled on 'Settings and Results' and they are Imported/Exported properly.<br>

Hence 3 steadies per 2 autos. <br>
<br>
Looking at Midnight's test summaries, it looks like all but 1 of the quivered tests resulted in a 2:1 rotation (2 steadies per auto), with the exception of test 8, which comes pretty close to a 3:2 ratio.<br>

</div>Looking at your numbers, I'm assuming that "general shot delay" means average time per shot (regardless of type), and that this is what you're looking at to evaluate "average overall shot throughput"?<br>
<br>
I do find it helpful to measure time per shot as you have done (or the inverse shots/time) rather than DPS results. I think a next logical step would be to compare your results with what you'd expect to achieve from legacy 1:1 and 1.5:1 rotations.<br>
<br>
For example, taking the results of your quivered tests:<br>

The blue numbers are the average shot times (or "delay" as you've called it) that I'm using to evaluate improvement over expected legacy rotation shot times. <br>
<br>
So, if I understand your results correctly, of the four quivered tests, the best improvement you achieved in terms shots/time (or time/shot) was actually not with the slower bow, but in Test 6 (2.6 speed bow, no Serpent's Swiftness), for which you saw a reduced average time per shot of about 8%.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_636083"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->First of all - you´re right I confused the 3:2 rotation with a 2:1 rotation actually. 3:2 meaning Auto - Steady - Steady.<br>
<br>
That beeing said there seems to be a general uncertainty about those terms, so I guess it´d be a good idea to clarify them. To my understanding they´re used as follows:<br>
<br>
1:1 = Auto - Steady (steady may be replaced with either multi or arcane, there´s only one special per auto though)<br>
1:1.5 = Auto - Steady - Auto - Steady - Special (special is either multi or arcane)<br>
2:3 = Auto - Steady - Auto - Steady - Steady (actually the same as 1:1.5 but no specials but steady are beeing use)<br>
1:2 = Auto - Steady - Steady (kind of uncommon rotation I´ve never seen theorycrafted in depth about anywhere on these boards, but the most common rotation on my macrotests)<br>
<br>
To answer your questions Stinkerbelle: delay is the time between two shots. Steady shot delay is the delay between two steady shots whereas general shot delay is the delay between any two shots following on each other so the latter is the one determing the absolute shot throughput. Assuming all shots would do roughly the same damage the highest shot throughput would also yield the best dps result. I think I´m gonna do a few tests with a standard castsequence macro and see how it compares.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_636093"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Yeah, like right now I have enough haste with a 3.0 weapon to spam the macro pretty much, under most conditions, and produce a 2:3 rotation. Your tests just didn't have that amount of haste, I guess. A 2.9 weapon + BM spec should have the right speed, it's around 2.08 - 2.1 to be able to spam the macro to produce a 2:3 rotation.<br>
<br>
And yes you can do a 2:3 rotation without any macro or without any special conditions, it's just harder to time everything 100% perfect and whatnot. So having a bit of haste + the 3.0 bows seems the best way to go, which won't be a problem at all after Sunwell's out, seeing as how there's only like 3 pieces of gear without haste so far.<br>
<br>
Anyway, yes, all the spreadsheet would have to do for MOST weapon speeds is reduce the GCD of a steady shot if the previous shot was Auto Shot by the time between the end of the previous shot and the auto shot shooting, up to a maximum of .5 seconds, and also remove the latency from affecting steady shot. From there you can just put in a button that does the "2:3" rotation (Auto-Steady-Auto-Steady-Steady) and it would be modeled for MOST situations, aside from the jitter we're seeing in auto-shot cast time.<br>
<br>
Anyway I'm tired and this got a little longer than I wanted but yeah, that's basically what's going on with this rotation.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>That's pretty much exactly what I have done. My first pass on the code was to intelligently pick Auto or Steady based on what the relative cooldowns were and prioritize Steady if it was at all available. That lead to a lot of Auto, Steady, Steady, Auto, Steady, Steady rotations, which isn't what we want.<br>
<br>
I'll just force the Auto, Steady, Steady, Auto, Steady pattern now. My initial work shows it as being even more of a mana drain than a 1:1, Priority rotation using max rank Arcane and Multi. But that fits with what people are seeing in game.<br>
<br>
Do we need the 3:2 rotation only for unhasted rotations? Or do people envision using it for Quick Shots and DST-based rotations too?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<u><b>A few conclusions that jump to my mind:</b></u><br>
<br>
- Five of the eight test series produced an almost perfect 3:2 rotation and a near perfect 1,5s average steady delay too. Depending on haste Auto shot is clipped between about 0,4s and 1,0s on those rotations though.<br>
- Haste doesn´t seem to have much of an impact on those 3:2 rotations. The average overall shot throughput is almost the same for all of them with faster attack speeds just clipping auto shot more than slow weapons. This favors slow weapons over fast ones for absolute damage.</div>

</div><br>
The ratio of steady to auto was 2:1 for all your tests that had some haste, except for the extreme case where you went BM with a 2.6 speed gun.  There, you actually got 3:2.  Not surprisingly, you did get more shots (10%).<br>
<br>
It's cute that this works and automatically adjusts for haste procs (going from 2:1 to 3:2 to 1:1 as the hastes stack).   But I'd be shocked if steady-multi-auto and steady-arcane-auto didn't outperform steady-steady-auto at most weapon speeds (although, of course, you can't start your next steady as soon, so the earlier autoshot following an arcane isn't as great as you'd think).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_637508"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Version 43 released - Buff Profiles! 3:2 rotations! Sunwell Loot!!!!<br>
<br>
 - Change Band of the Eternal Champion proc duration to 10 seconds.<br>
 - Corrected some bugs in the profiles matrix. Everything should display accurately now.<br>
 - Corrected Draenei base Intelligence to 78 (from 82.)<br>
 - Corrected some item stats (Embrace of the Twisting Nether, Bow-Stitched Leggings)<br>
 - Fixed a bug in Shoulder socket bonuses that was sometimes showing bonuses for gear that did not have sockets.<br>
 - Corrected some item name spellings (Ancient Draenei War Talisman, Wicked Flame Spessarite, Greater Inscription of Vengeance)<br>
 - Remodeled Mark of Conquest with a 17 second internal cooldown and 13% chance to proc. This is based on data collected by Xeno of Suramar.<br>
 - If you select Thor'idal, the Stars' Fury as a ranged weapon the ammo is defaulted to None. (This is not applicable for OO versions.)<br>
 - Added new gear (Thor'idal, the Stars' Fury, Blackened Naruu Sliver, Apolyon, the Soul-render, Fang of Kalecgos, Muramasa, Crus of the Apocalypse, Shiv of Exsanguination, Hard Khorium Choker, Shoulderpads of the Silvermoon Retainer, Breeching Comet, Edge of Opression, Sunrage Shoulderpads, Hauberk of the Warbringer, Bladed Chaos Tunic, Leggings of the Immortal Night, Shoulderpads of Vehemence, Duplicitous Guise, Truestrike Crossbow, Bombardier's Blade, The Sunbreaker, Shattered Sun Pendant of Might, Gronnstalker's Belt, Gronnstalker's Bracers, Gronnstalker's Boots, Fletcher's Gloves of the Phoenix, Embrace of the Phoenix, Surestrike Goggles v3.0, Gylph of the Gladiator, Shadowed Gauntlets of Paroxysm, Sunrage Shoulderpads, Carapace of Sun and Shadow, Hard Khorium Band, Mounting Vengeance, Stalker's Legguards, Tunic of the Ranger Lord).<br>
 - Provide for three Buff Profiles. These are Loaded/Saved on the 'Buffs' tab, the names are controlled on 'Settings and Results' and they are Imported/Exported properly.<br>
 - Users can select from 3 types of shot rotations - Hand-Weaving, Castsequence, and Spam. These refer to the common methods of timing by hand, or using some of the various macros available.<br>
 - Using Castsequence macros results in latency being added to the start of every shot cast to account for server&lt;-&gt;client communication.<br>
 - Using either Hand-Weaving or Spam macros results in latency being a factor when computing GCD based on whether or not the previous shot was an Auto Shot. This means the Shot Rotation matrix will now try and mimic the behavior seen of the GCD being client-only.<br>
 - Added a button to build the Auto, Steady, Steady, Auto, Steady (usually referred to as "3:2") shot rotation automatically.<br>

Making my shot rotations in v 43, and I notice that a hand-weaved or Spam 1:1.X (Multi &amp; Arcane) rotation results in a ~80 DPS gain over Castsequence, and thereby a ~20 dps gain over 1:1 (Prio) for my cookie-cutter BM + Wolfslayer setup.<br>

Does this seem wrong to anyone else?<br>
<br>
Also possibly related, I notice that theres not a single Multishot in my Hand-weaved/Spam 1:1.X rotation, even though I have selected Multi (Yes) for the rotation.  Multi-shot does however appear in the rotation if I use the Castsequence setting.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_637994"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Thanks again cheeky for your hard work!<br>
I achieved the best theoretical results with the 1.1.x rotation (x=arcane), + 1.1.x rotation (x=arcane) under quickshots, but only when "spammed" oder "handweaved". Since I got my SP garanteed, mana is not the limiting factor here.<br>
<br>
Is there any macro out there that can actualy !spam! an auto, steady, arcane rotation like its mentioned in the spreadsheet?<br>
<br>
My first suggestion:<br>
<br>
<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px">
	<div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom:0px"><img src="assets/code_html.gif" border="0"></div>
	<pre class="alt2" dir="ltr" style="
		margin: 0px;
		padding: 3px;
		border: 1px inset;
		width: 694px;
		height: 98px;
		text-align: left;
		overflow: auto">/cast !Auto Shot
/cast Steady Shot
/cast Arcane Shot
/cast [target=pettarget, exists] Kill Command
/cast [target=pettarget, exists] Lightning Breath</pre>
</div>Can't test that right now, but looks reasonable to me atm. If I get this right it will do the 3:2 rotation until the next arcane shot is up. The arcane here fills the gap where the double steady would appear in the standard spammed 3:2 rotation. The spreadsheed tells me it will be:<br>
[auto, steady, auto, steady, auto, steady+arcane,] [auto, steady, auto, steady, auto, steady+arcane,]<br>
<br>
The weird thing is that the next steady after the arcane is started 1s after the last arcane. I thought arcane triggers a 1,5s GCD....<br>
... now I'm kind of confused.....<br>

I downloaded the newest version, and love the Buff Profiles.  However, when attempting to switch profiles via the drop down I get a cell protection error.<br>
<br>
Although, seeing this addition to the spreadsheet made me wonder...would it be possible to make selectable Talent profiles also?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Am I right in assuming that v 42 and back use v 43's 'Castsequence' logic for building shot rotations?<br>
<br>
Making my shot rotations in v 43, and I notice that a hand-weaved or Spam 1:1.X (Multi &amp; Arcane) rotation results in a ~80 DPS gain over Castsequence, and thereby a ~20 dps gain over 1:1 (Prio) for my cookie-cutter BM + Wolfslayer setup.<br>
<br>
Does this seem wrong to anyone else?<br>
<br>
Also possibly related, I notice that theres not a single Multishot in my Hand-weaved/Spam 1:1.X rotation, even though I have selected Multi (Yes) for the rotation.  Multi-shot does however appear in the rotation if I use the Castsequence setting.</div>

</div>Yes, the rotations built in v42- are the same as Castsequence macros in v43. I needed a way to distinguish when the Hunter would have to wait for server confirmation to cast the next step and also to allow for the spam and handwoven rotations where you can recover the GCD during Auto Shot's cast. This was the best I was able to come up with.<br>
<br>
Those types of gains are what have been seen in the testing done. I know that moving from a hand-timed rotation to the 3:2 macro was a very slight upgrade for me, but others who went from the same rotation but using a /castsequence macro saw huge gains with the 3:2 macro.<br>
<br>
The logic of the 1:1.X rotation is to pick the best non-Steady special available based on cooldowns. If both Arcane and Multi are available and Arcane does more damage that should get picked. Try scaling down your rank of Arcane to lower it's damage (or decrease target armor to pump up Multi's damage) and see how that affects results. Without knowing the timing differences in your setup in picking Castsequence versus Hand-timed I can't say why there is a difference, but I'd check the GCD behavior and times each shot is available (can be seen in the shot rotation matrix in the wall of numbers everyone ignores.)<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>But surely multi is available when arcane is still on cooldown...  What I'm saying is that there isn't a single multi-shot in all 50 lines.  Even stranger is that this is only when I have selected 'hand-weaved' or 'Spam'; Multi-shots are there when I choose 'Castsequence'.  Why would a timing difference make multi-shot a more or less attractive shot to use?<br>

</div>My buffed crit rate is 36.96. The talents chosen were cookie cutter BM raid 41/20/0 with the exception of 5/5 Imp Arcane shot and 2/5  Mortal shots. <a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?talent=cxbR0gxRwuVoVVioM" target="_blank">Talent Calculator - World of Warcraft</a>. The shot rotation is Auto-Steady-Auto-Steady-Arcane (1:1.5). All of the shot damages reflected the lowered critical strike damage bonus. <br>
<br>
The shot frequency changed however. Auto shot frequency with 2/5 Imp Arcane shot is 2.71. With 5/5 Imp Arcane shot, it went down to 2.44. I assume this is due to the reduced CD of Arcane shot. Also, with 5/5 Imp Arcane shot, it takes me 48.71 seconds to  achieve 50 shots. With 2/5 it takes 54.11 seconds.<br>

<br>
Ok I think I found a few flaws in the new shot rotation calculation<br>
<br>
If I understand correctly with the castsquence option my lag is added to each SS because I have to wait for the server to confirm I’m done with my auto shot. That makes sense. But in the sheet I always wait 0,2 sec even when I shouldn't. For example:<br>
<br>
-Steady starts 0,0 (GCD ready @ 1,5)<br>
-Auto ends 1,3<br>
-next Steady starts 1,7 (&lt;-- this should be 1,5 because my client already knew I’m ready for my next SS and I shouldn't wait another 0,2 sec)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Another thing I notice is that the "castsequence-lag" is also added to arcane and multishot in the 1:1.x rotation. But I think those rotation doesn’t use /castsequence for arcane and multi. They are using /castrandom to wave in their shots so it would be more accurate to only add the "castsequence-lag" to the SS in those rotations<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_639588"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Two observations (on the latest spreadsheet version - 43) that I noticed but didn't see addressed in the thread-<br>
<br>
1) It appears that the best DPS ranged weapon in the game is the Wolfslayer Sniper Rifle.  I ran all the weapon combo's against my gear just to check.  This surely has to be a stat bug for this weapon.  As much as I like Kara and the Opera event I don't think this weapon is better than Bristleblitz or BoBB.<br>
<br>
2) The spreadsheet doesn't appear to adjust DPS if haste pushes Attack speed below 2.00 secs and thus shot clipping occurs.  As a BM hunter it doesnt take very much haste to push the ranged attack speed below 2.00.  For simplicity sake: assume you use a 1:1 auto/steady shot rotation-  A sub 2.00 second attack speed will cause you to clip shots and really impact your DPS.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

You know I love your spreadsheet, reccomend it all the time.  However, since I have a Rogue as well and have been helping our guilds Rogues, I have been messing around with their spreadsheet.  In many many ways, the Hunter one is clearly superior, being far faster for one.  However, there are a couple of features they have that I was wondering if it would be possible to incorporate into the Hunter version.<br>
<br>
1. On the Rogue version, once you get it all set up and sorted, it actually has a list of items that are a DPS upgrade for you.  You can actually mouse over your gear page and it will show upgrades for that spot.  There is an option to turn this on, called "show only DPS upgrades."  This is pretty sweet.  I understand that it may involve far more computations and such, but is it possible?<br>
<br>
2.  It has options to remove gear selections for certain instances.  For example, if I am not in BT or MH, I can filter out those items.  Also listed next to the names of items from the drop down menus, it says what instances they come from.<br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong, your spreadsheet is awesome, this isn't criticism, just some input.  Hell man, do you have a paypal account?  I think you should be rewarded for your work.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I was glad to see the suggestion I made was implemented with your spreadsheet (buff profiles).  However, I am having issues with it.  Every time I try to change it I get an error stating that the cell is protected and read only and tells me I will need to turn off protection.  However, when I try to do this it asks for a password.  I am using Excel 2003.  I also ran into this problem trying to make a Custom MH for the Shivering Felspine.  I have my security set to the lowest possible for macros but most likely there is something else i need to change.  If you or anybody else could help I would be greatly appreciative.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>You can already do this via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080402040057/http://www.lootrank.com/wow" target="_blank">www.lootrank.com/wow;</a> just plug in the attribute values you get from the spreadsheet.<br>
<br>
The correct DPS upgrade algorithm is tricky because there are 2 variables: the dps upgrade including +hit and the dps upgrade not including +hit. <br>
<br>
For example, I can get a higher dps by apparently <i>lowering</i> my dps swapping an item with +hit for one without +hit, and then swapping a second item without +hit with an item with +hit. Searching for such upgrade paths is really too much to ask of the spreadsheet, IMO. There are more important things for Cheeky to spend his time on!<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_641396"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Cheeky, I have a concern via the 3:2.<br>
<br>
I was doing a lot of theory crafting of my currect gear options using your spreadsheet.<br>
<br>
Spreadsheet:   QS tab, 62 haste, 117 HR, Aspect of the hawk (I have 5/5 IAOTH) latency .2sec, no other buffs, i couldn't find a way to indicate for sure that the target was marked, I assume that is the case.<br>
<br>
1:1 steady       1:1 Arcane/steady         3:2<br>
Wolfsniper         836                     849*                   724<br>
<br>
SS longbow        840                     865*                   782<br>
<br>
<br>
Dr. Boom  in game   62 haste, 117hr, Aspect and mark on Boom,   latency was .2sec as well<br>
<br>
SS longbow           --                   803 ± 33*            880 ± 64<br>
<br>
*order was auto, arcane, auto, steady, auto, steady, auto , steady, repeat   <br>
<br>
<br>
Now, I am not concerend about the drop from 865 to 803, what does bother me is the complete flip flop from the 3:2 in the spreadsheet vs 3:2 in live testing.   I only bring this up as I was performing the Boom tess with a variety of weapons and also went through a lot of different gear combinations / rotations on the spreadsheet.<br>
<br>
The general conclusion from the spreadsheet, through out a variety of set ups was that a 1:1 priority with Arcane/steady should outperform a the spreadsheet 3:2.   But repeatidly, on tests on Boom with wolfsniper, steelhawk, sunfury or SSL,   the 3:2 produced better DPS.<br>
<br>
<br>
So, my thoughts:<br>
<br>
1.  The spread sheet is set for a lvl 73 mob...I couldnt change the custom option (probably a office 2007 problem) (maybe there could be a Dr. Boom option?)...hmm, how much would this effect?<br>
<br>
2. Maybe my testing method was off, but I was trying to replicate the spreadsheet.   I did 4 tests at 60 sec intervals (so I wouldn't worry about mana consumption).   I think there needs to be a discussion started to decide what is the right way to test, and the wrong way.  I know I added a lot of variables with my tsunami trinket and leaving Hawk on, but thats what the spreadsheet has on.   Usually i test with hawk off and a different trinket in that does not proc (skyguard is a fixed crit, and I wont trigger the proc).<br>
<br>
3. Maybe its a problem with my gear, I know, I need more hit rating, but I am pretty sure the alck of hit would translate evenly to both a 1:1 and a 3:2.  (without the haste, I have 136 HR)<br>
<br>
4.  Your model of the 3:2 isnt exactly on target with what is actually happening.  Note: I am not complaining, I am fully aware of the whole cluster fuck that is "what is the 3:2 macro actually doing?" problem.  Just trying to point out a concern I currently have with your model<br>
<br>
<br>
** I could do more tests, but it probably wont be until tomorrow.  Name the way you want me to test and I'll do it.<br>
<br>
Anyways, good work, keep it up, and thanks again.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Cheeky, I have a concern via the 3:2.<br>
<br>
I was doing a lot of theory crafting of my currect gear options using your spreadsheet.<br>
<br>
Spreadsheet:   QS tab, 62 haste, 117 HR, Aspect of the hawk (I have 5/5 IAOTH) latency .2sec, no other buffs, i couldn't find a way to indicate for sure that the target was marked, I assume that is the case.<br>
<br>
1:1 steady       1:1 Arcane/steady         3:2<br>
Wolfsniper         836                     849*                   724<br>
<br>
SS longbow        840                     865*                   782<br>
<br>
<br>
Dr. Boom  in game   62 haste, 117hr, Aspect and mark on Boom,   latency was .2sec as well<br>
<br>
SS longbow           --                   803 ± 33*            880 ± 64<br>
<br>
*order was auto, arcane, auto, steady, auto, steady, auto , steady, repeat   <br>
<br>
<br>
Now, I am not concerend about the drop from 865 to 803, what does bother me is the complete flip flop from the 3:2 in the spreadsheet vs 3:2 in live testing.   I only bring this up as I was performing the Boom tess with a variety of weapons and also went through a lot of different gear combinations / rotations on the spreadsheet.<br>
<br>
The general conclusion from the spreadsheet, through out a variety of set ups was that a 1:1 priority with Arcane/steady should outperform a the spreadsheet 3:2.   But repeatidly, on tests on Boom with wolfsniper, steelhawk, sunfury or SSL,   the 3:2 produced better DPS.<br>
<br>
<br>
So, my thoughts:<br>
<br>
1.  The spread sheet is set for a lvl 73 mob...I couldnt change the custom option (probably a office 2007 problem) (maybe there could be a Dr. Boom option?)...hmm, how much would this effect?<br>
<br>
2. Maybe my testing method was off, but I was trying to replicate the spreadsheet.   I did 4 tests at 60 sec intervals (so I wouldn't worry about mana consumption).   I think there needs to be a discussion started to decide what is the right way to test, and the wrong way.  I know I added a lot of variables with my tsunami trinket and leaving Hawk on, but thats what the spreadsheet has on.   Usually i test with hawk off and a different trinket in that does not proc (skyguard is a fixed crit, and I wont trigger the proc).<br>
<br>
3. Maybe its a problem with my gear, I know, I need more hit rating, but I am pretty sure the alck of hit would translate evenly to both a 1:1 and a 3:2.  (without the haste, I have 136 HR)<br>
<br>
4.  Your model of the 3:2 isnt exactly on target with what is actually happening.  Note: I am not complaining, I am fully aware of the whole cluster fuck that is "what is the 3:2 macro actually doing?" problem.  Just trying to point out a concern I currently have with your model<br>
<br>
<br>
** I could do more tests, but it probably wont be until tomorrow.  Name the way you want me to test and I'll do it.<br>
<br>
Anyways, good work, keep it up, and thanks again.</div>

AH, so when I see live DPS test result when using the "3:2"  I should actually compare it to the spreadsheets result for a 1:1 steady rotation?   Ah, I can see where you are coming for with this.<br>

		<div id="post_message_642704"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Hi there,<br>
<br>
I'm a bit puzzled with the stat / dps-increase table at the results tab. For instance, with my setup it says 1agi ~ 0.431dps while 1ap ~ 0.224dps. This means AP&gt;agi for me according to this table (which, IMO, seems to be incorrect). Adding 10agi manually in the gear tab however gives more DPS than adding 20AP manually, which is what I expected. What am I missing here?<br>

<br>
The correct DPS upgrade algorithm is tricky because there are 2 variables: the dps upgrade including +hit and the dps upgrade not including +hit. <br>
<br>
For example, I can get a higher dps by apparently <i>lowering</i> my dps swapping an item with +hit for one without +hit, and then swapping a second item without +hit with an item with +hit. Searching for such upgrade paths is really too much to ask of the spreadsheet, IMO. There are more important things for Cheeky to spend his time on!</div>

Curious if there is anyway you can add drums of battle to this for the 80 haste. <br>
<br>
Most high end raiders use haste drums on every encounter. This 80 haste affects the outcome of everything within that final spreadsheet values. <br>
<br>
Everyone in the group has them so they are always up. Can this be a constant buff in the spreadsheet? As of now im just making a custom item with the same stats as a current item and smacking 80 haste on it in the spreadsheet to accomplish this.<br>
<br>
Also is bloodlust availiable am i missing it? <br>
<br>
Using your spreadsheet i was really putting alot into gettign the dragonspine. But fully raid buffed on Teron im just not seeing a dps inscrease. I believe with haste pots and drums running +2 bloodlusts the DST procs are just overboard.<br>
<br>
Im just lookign for more RAID specs out of the spreadsheet is that possible to add those or atleast the haste drums. Thanks!!<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

On to my question.  I have a Shifting Shadow Draenite (+3agi, +4stam) equipped on my shoulders currently.  When I switch to a gem that matches the same socket (bonus is still achieved), but with higher agi (for sake of testing, tried a Delicate Crimson Spinel +10agi and a Delicate Blood Garnet +6agi), the dps listed actually goes down by a fair bit (about 10 Hunter DPS).  Perhaps I am missing something regarding why that is the case?<br>

Using your spreadsheet i was really putting alot into gettign the dragonspine. But fully raid buffed on Teron im just not seeing a dps inscrease. I believe with haste pots and drums running +2 bloodlusts the DST procs are just overboard.<br>
<br>
Im just lookign for more RAID specs out of the spreadsheet is that possible to add those or atleast the haste drums. Thanks!!</div>

</div>Much easier way to do this.  On the Gear page, scroll down to the blue Hand Adjust line and just type in 80 or however much in the column for Haste.  You can easily add stats to see how it would effect your DPS, like manually typing in the value for the drums, or for heroism.</div>

		<div id="post_message_648221">First, thanks a million for all of the wonderful work on this awesome tool! It is by far the best class spreadsheet that I have seen.<br>
<br>
Possible bug concerning rotations.<br>
<br>
The 1:1.X button with both Multishot and Arcane Shot selected works fine when unhasted with either the Hand-Weaved or Castsequence Macro? options chosen.<br>
<br>
However, when I enter the haste rating for Rapid Fire in the Hand Adjust area on the Gear tab, the updated "1:1.5" shot rotations are not working out as expected.<br>
<br>
With Castsequence selected, I get the expected rotation that squeezes in some extra steady-autos and does a 17 shot cycle with 7 steady-autos and arcane shots after the 1st and 5th of them and multishot after the 3rd.<br>
<br>
However, with Hand-Weaved chosen, I get an 11 shot cycle with 5 steady-autos and the arcane shot after the first steady auto with no multishots. Even if I reduce the Latency from the default 0.2 to 0.1, I still do not see any multishots. The rotation does change though to a 1:1.3 rotation with 3 steady-autos and the arcane shot after the first steady.<br>
<br>
To see where the multishot would come back in, I tried haste ratings of 400, 300, 200, and 100. It was not until HR 100 that the multishot was brought back in.<br>
<br>
Is this related to the GCD client-side modeling for Hand-Weaven? Is this as intended? Doesn't seem like it should work that way and that multishots should still be included in the rotation.</div>

		<div id="post_message_648747">First of all my compliments on the great job Cheeky! Keep it up!<br>
<br>
My question: In the "Shot Rotation" tab, Macro choice you have 3 options: Hand-weaved, Castsequence &amp; Spam. Handweaved and castsequence for the 1:1.X rotation are I guess pretty self explanatory. But, when you say spam, what exactly is the macro that you use? I am asking this because there are a couple of alternatives for this term:<br>
<br>
<b>1st Spam Macro 1:1.X (only arcane)</b><br>
...<br>
/cast !Auto Shot<br>
/castrandom Steady Shot, Arcane Shot <br>
...<br>
<br>
<b>2nd Spam Macro 1:1.X (only arcane) </b><br>
...<br>
/cast !Auto Shot<br>
/cast Steady Shot<br>
/castrandom Arcane Shot<br>
...<br>
<br>
<b>3rd Spam Macro 1:1.X (only arcane)</b><br>
...<br>
/castsequence !Auto Shot, Steady Shot<br>
/castrandom Arcane Shot<br>
...<br>
<br>
According to the spreadsheet this is the heaviest dps method for me by a large margin from the others  (100-200dps). But I tried all three macros on Dr-Guinea-Pig-Boom and got no real differences. The one that came a bit higher than the rest and it's my best guess is the 1st one, but I would like to make sure I am correct.<br>
<br>
Thanks in advance for the clarification.<br>
<br>
PS: The Buffs Profile selection tab is protected in this version of the spreadsheet and you cannot change it (cell D4).</div>

</div>There are two things I would check:<br>
<br>
1)  Do your combat logs match what the spreadsheet says is your optimal rotation?  I know that when I use these types of spam macros, I can never get the ideal rotation since my lag is too low and I don't have enough haste.  I basically just get my specials firing back-to-back-to-back... with no autoshots.<br>
<br>
2)  Are you sure you sample size was high enough.  Run the tests many times and make sure there are no outside variables affecting this tests.  For example, don't use any spells or trinkets that cause procs, if your test is longer than 2 minutes, don't use hunters mark, etc.</div>

</div>1) Of course it was checked. Besides some minor clipping that was noted quite rarely, they match.<br>
<br>
2) 6-7 times x 1 min x each rotation. Outside factors where eliminated of course (no trinkets, no AotH, etc), but results varied a bit due to different crit rate, which was expected. The sample was decent enough though to get a conclusion.<br>
<br>
Again, I want to note that I am curious as what is the <i>modeling of the 'spam macro' </i>from the three above in the <i>spreadsheet</i>.</div>

		<div id="post_message_649760">Hi All,<br>
<br>
Cheeky's spreadsheet is simply amazing and my dps has increased significantly since I began using it and raiding.  I use it as a guide for all my upgrades.<br>
<br>
I recently dl'ed the newest spreadsheet (43) to try to figure out what I could use from the new sunwell loots (I realize they might be changed but I like to see what's available to me) and while going over my upgrade chart I found out the the twinblades of the Phoenix from Kael are going to give me a 2DPS decrease versus my Vengeful Gladiator's Waraxe.  What's odd about this is the older version I had (not that old mind you) put the twinblades as one of the best (if not the best) 2-hnd weapon I could get.  I realize I loose some hit when getting the twinblades, but I tried resocketing and it still showed a small decrease. <br>
<br>
Anyone else see this?  Perhaps Cheeky changed the values of Armor penetration?<br>
<br>
I made sure I have all the buffs on me (I am mostly concerned with raid dps and we have 4-5 palys in our raid most of the time.  So I have all the paly buffs, mage buff, druid buff, warp burger and flask of relentless striking). I use a 1:1 rotation and a cat pet.<br>
<br>
The thing is I would hate to pass on the twinblade only to find out something was a bit off with the Spreadsheet, just as much as if I "Need" the twinblade and find out they hurt my dps (and it could have gone to someone else)<br>
<br>
Any help/insight is always appreciated.<br>

</div>The spreadsheet models rotations, not macros. How you achieve the rotation is an exercise left to the reader. I've been a complete failure at generating the 3:2 rotation with a <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30105" target="_blank">[Serpent Spine Longbow]</a>, so I've switched back to a 1:1 with my <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28581" target="_blank">[Wolfslayer Sniper Rifle]</a> and started setting personal DPS highs again. Other people have had incredible luck with the spam-macros. There is too much randomness involved in seeing how macros translate into rotations.<br>
<br>
I added changes to the shot rotation to better model some of the timing we are seeing. I don't think any of us really has a great understanding of how to model the newer macros and the server-side changes.<br>

</div>I plan to add the Pally buff, but no other BM Hunter really provides 3% extra damage. It's something less than that, and it depends on that other Hunter and his pet. (Plus, for comparitive purposes 3% damage is just 3% damage, it doesn't help in evaluating gear/talent/rotation concerns of your own.)<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_651618"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Bug in v44:  elixirs get cleared by the flask field being set to None during buff profile loading<br>
<br>
Could we get an option to ignore meta gem requirements, to make comparing pieces quicker in cases that require swapping gems around in the rest of the gear?<br>
<br>
There's also some buffs that could be added:  Unleashed Rage (for pet), Inspiring Presence, Flame Cap (1m duration/3m cooldown), Haste Potion (eek, doubling the count of haste states--not worth the trouble?), and Improved Sanctity Aura, as well as FI's/Improved Seal of the Crusader as Estala said.<br>
<br>
And one final pipe dream:  I'd love to see a fight duration limit in order to work towards being able to value mana gains in terms of total damage done.  This would then benefit from adding buff options for modeling various mana potions, Vampiric Touch, Spellsurge etc.  I also noticed that Viper is being modeled as 25% of Int still, but better math in a continuous model eludes me.  Then again maybe what I want is more a simulator than a spreadsheet.  Either way, thanks for the invaluable tool.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<strong><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Rotation prediction for 3:2 not reliable?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></strong>

		<!-- message -->
		<div id="post_message_651619"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Cheeky I think I found a possible flaw in your spreadsheet regarding the 3:2 rotation, as I am obtaining an unreliable and incorrect simulation. Results from the spreadsheet showed up that the 3:2 rotation is the worst option I could adopt, compared to every other one (incase Armory is down I am using a <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28581" target="_blank">[Wolfslayer Sniper Rifle]</a>). These results confused me quite much since I have been using the 3:2 for a while and always noticed high dps on live realms.<br>
<br>
So I decided to run a test on Dr Boom and tried the 1:1 Auto-Steady rotation and the 3:2 rotation. Unfortunately I am unable to provide a combat log since for some reason it does not save my results in wowcombatlog.txt ( /combatlog command works, it says it is starting to log, but infact it won't save anything on the txt file, even after giving the /combatlog input again).<br>
<br>
So far the results from the spreadsheet were these (Both spreadsheet and live testing results are not including pet dps):<br>
<br>
1:1 Auto-steady rotation -&gt; 810 dps<br>
3:2 Rotation -&gt; 751 dps<br>
<br>
But in fact the results from live testing on Dr. Boom were:<br>
<br>
1:1 Auto-steady rotation -&gt; 760 dps<br>
3:2 rotation -&gt; 830 dps<br>
<br>
While I understand that the spreadsheet can't provide exact informations regarding dps, I am unable to figure out why the spreadsheet penalizes so much 3:2 rotations, when in fact 3:2 rotations seem to best any other rotation on "live" testing. <br>
<br>
Note: All live testing were performed using Imp. AotH / Hourglass of the unraveller, Hunter Mark always up and Crit % was constant with the value I have, 30%. Live testing is a result of 3 sessions (Lenght of the session= time till I ran out of mana)on Dr Boom, under the same conditions.<br>
<br>
P.S.: Forgive my english .<br>

</div>My bet would be that your latency is worse than you have input in the spreadsheet, and the /castsequence macro is generating much more clipping than you think. Getting a timestamped combat log is the only was to ascertain if that is happening or not.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Looks like a lot of your Auto shots are 2+ seconds apart. Not all, but I'd run this log through Glau's tool and see how bad your overall clipping is. It looks really bad.<br>
<br>
And I need to stess again - the reason people see huge gains with the 3:2 macro isn't because it is super-better. It's because they didn't know had bad the /castsequence macro was clipping them.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

 <br>
The way I read what expertise rating does, taking it into account has about the same effect(s) as hit rating. The statistic doesn't exist (if I'm not mistaken) in the spreadsheet and would need to be added in the gear selection and on the custom gear tab.<br>
 <br>
Edit: thanks for clearing both things up. We're using the [ wowitem ] tag on our forum<br>
Edit2: The ring actually adds 20 expertise rating. The dagger and feral rating are outdated.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Cheeky, thanks for the quick reply.<br>
<br>
1.) I think you are referring to the post where you mention trying to model the new macro? I guess by modeling that you would in effect handle the auto/steady/steady rotation for gear/specs where effective weapon speed was above certain threshold, e.g. MM or Surv builds.<br>
<br>
2.) Is it more difficult to model <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32410" target="_blank">[Thundering Skyfire Diamond]</a> than IAoH or DST?<br>
<br>
In any case, what do you think about these approximations/calculations (assuming pure auto/steady rotation with a BM build):<br>
<br>
With no metagem your spreadsheet reports (using some random gear and AS/SS rotation):<br>
hunter dps: 806.55<br>
<br>
If I equip <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32409" target="_blank">[Relentless Earthstorm Diamond]</a> your spreadsheet reports (with the same gear &amp; rotation):<br>
hunter dps: 818.25<br>
<br>
If I equip <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32410" target="_blank">[Thundering Skyfire Diamond]</a>:<br>
I do the following calculations (for simple auto/steady rotation):<br>
240 haste rating --&gt; 240/15.7 ~= 15.3% faster attacks for 6 seconds<br>
Assuming 1ppm, or approx. 10% uptime, you could say it averages out to about 1.53% faster attacks<br>
That in turn (again, assuming AS/SS rotation) is about 1.53% extra dps<br>
That would mean, hunter dps should be: 1.0153 * 806.55 = 818.89<br>
<br>
Do you think I signifficantly oversimplified anything?</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>Now that we're done with all the hubbub for the most part about the 3:2 rotation modeling, I remembered this post and took a look again. For me, if those numbers hold water, the meta would be about an 8 dps upgrade over Relentless Earthstorm. Of course speed doesn't translate directly into DPS like that, but still, 8 dps is a large enough margin that I think it warrants at least some preliminary testing in the spreadsheet. I'll see what I can do, should just be able to change the numbers on IotH.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_652959"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->There´s currently a bug on PTR that allows "duping" stats (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080416032210/http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=4823644742&amp;sid=1&amp;pageNo=1" target="_blank">details</a>). I don´t see any harm beeing done using it solely on PTR but it´s propably a great way to (re)check theories about the two-roll system or internal cast speed of auto shot etc.<br>

		<div id="post_message_653038"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Hi, 1st time poster here.<br>
<br>
I'd like to find out the best outcome for 3 talent point spots. Here is some rough math unless there are unseen variables I'm missing. {Givin a humanoid target}, 3 points into MS or HS.<br>
<br>
18% bonus damage to your crits<br>
or<br>
3% damage to all hits+ 3% additional damage to crits. (includes the allready +3% regular hits)<br>
<br>
to simplify, hits will be  3 shots and 1 bieng counted as a crit. or 33.33% crit<br>
<br>
So far here is what i get.<br>
<br>
The 18% bonus will get divided by (3) for the 1/3rd of the time you get the bonus used. <br>
<h1><a href="#top" class="nuwiki_top_link">[top]</a>6% bonus damage avg. overall.<br>
<br>
3% to all over the same 3 hits will give you 9% bonus for each of the 3 hits and the extra 3% bonus added for the crit to the total.<br>
</h1><br>
12% bonus overall.<br>
<br>
This topic was brought up before but was not accounting for the bonus to crit on HS.<br>
<br>
Is this wrong? If so please help. Thanks<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_656397">I did some more extensive testing on PTR while the bug still allowed me to.<br>
<br>
First I tried to verify the two roll system. To do this I got myself a crit rate of  more than 100% while staying at 0% hit rate.<br>
Of <b>846</b> Auto Shots at Dr. Boom <b>791</b> (93,5%) were critical, <b>24</b> (2,84%) were blocked and <b>31</b> (3,66%) were misses.<br>
Not only does this confirm Lactoses testing it also poves that just like with the melee table block pushes crit of the attack table - though this should really be a non-issue for "uncheated" Hunters. <br>
<br>
The second test was to see if there really is an unhasteable 0,5s cast time for auto shot or if it can actually go off faster.<br>
In 369,593s I shot exactly 1031 auto shots which makes an average of 1 shot per 0,359s where it should theoretically have been 0,253s. About 0,1s slower than expected but also 0,141s faster than it should be possibe if there was a hard 0,5s cap for auto shot "casting time".</div>

</div>Well my testing certainly hints otherwise. It seemed more like first roll miss-&gt;hit and second roll block-&gt;crit-&gt;norm (left one pushing the right ones off the attack table). If your theory was sound it either shouldn´t be possible to not having a critical block (crit pushing off normal attacks) or at least a lot more critical blocks than normal blocks (normal attacks pushing off critical attacks) with a crit chance of 100%+, right?<br>
This would also be more consistant with melee attack table mechanics where there are no critical blocks either.<br>

		<div id="post_message_657334">Cheeky, a question regarding mana/oom modelling if I may...<br>
<br>
With the additon of the new "upgraded" Alchemist Stones (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080308095119/http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/february/alchemystones.jpg" target="_blank">link</a>), do you have any plans to re-model the "Time to OOM" to include different types of pots, the effect on your dps when switching to AOTV and average dps over pre-defined fight lengths, etc?<br>
<br>
Personally, I tend to get lumped in the "random" raid group along with the Holy Priests, any excess Warlocks, etc. If I'm lucky I might get another Hunter or I'll get to buff the melee group which means I have serious mana problems over long fights and usually find myself in AOTV at some point.<br>
<br>
Whilst I love your spreadsheet I often find myself wondering whether or not it's advantageous for me to take a lower dps item in favour of one that's likely to increase my time to OOM and thus stay in ATOH as opposed to AOTV. With the new Alchemist Stones I'm now <i>seriously</i> tempted to drop my <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28034"><span><span class="bluename">[Hourglass of the Unraveller]</span></span></a> and I'm sure many others will have similar questions.<br>
<br>
Thanks for all your hard work.</div>

		<div id="post_message_657398">2 Short Questions, please: <br>
Its been a little bit tricky to fill in this incredible Spreadsheet, but I think I managed it quite ok. At the moment the calculate gives me a total DPS of 1282 (1007 + Pet). Is this realistic for a T6 Hunter? If it is, I am satisfied in doing  everything right. <br>
<br>
But one Question to the summary: Is the value of the Critcial-Chance with installation-counted (In the Total DPS)? (Translation by Babelfish)  Or ist it DPS + Crit? Im quite sure, it is summarized in the dps, isnt it?<br>
<br>
At last, thanks to "Cheeky" for this fantastic Sheet. Im sure, no one can imagine how many hours it took to build this. Thanks.</div>

		<div id="post_message_657488">Well, I haven´t been able to decypher every column of the new combatlog but everything I read out of it hints towards that conclusion. If someone can point me towards a thread where the diffrent columns and their meanings are explained I´d appreciate it.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile if you´re interested in the details I can describe how I´ve come to my conclusion:<br>
At first I realized that there are two distinct damage ranges for all of my auto shots that did hit. One is between 271 and 382 (the supposedly blocked hits) and another between 736 and 1045 (the supposedly critical hits). Now I compared the lines with the blocked hits with those where I critted and realized that a) in every line with a block there was also a 49 in a certain column whereas there´s a nil in those lines where I critted (and blank when I missed completely). This seems to be the amount of damage that has been blocked (fits with the screenshot I posted). Last not least I realized there´s anorger column that only shows 1, nil or blank for all my autoshots and those too fit with my crits, blocks and misses.</div>

From all the testing that has been done so far there are up to three rolls.<br>
<br>
1) Hit/Miss/Block<br>
<br>
2) Critical<br>
<br>
3) Partial Resist<br>
<br>
Most of the first two rolls is modeled in the spreadsheet.<br>

I don't believe block is modeled as we don't really understand how much NPCs will block for.  I also do not believe the partial resists for Arcane Shot are modeled (All bosses have a base 25 resistance to all schools that cannot be mitigated)</div>

I don't see this as proof of a two-roll system.  I see it as proof that misses push crits off of the ranged combat table before they push hits off.  What am I missing here?<br>

The real test is to have a lot of shooting with high crit and miss rates (thousands of shots), then to compare the ratios.</div>

<br>
Tests like Lactose's one can only proof that hunters doesn't use a 1-roll-system like meeles. But they do not necessarily proof that misschance reduces critchance!<br>
There can be a lot of other system, which allow misses with 100% critchance but doesn't decrease the critchance if critchance + misschance &lt; 1.<br>
<br>
The only way we can (nearly) surely say that crits can be misses are tests with 10.000 and more attacks.<br>
Of course there's a chance that the result of the test is wrong. But it is very very low, definitely litte enough.</div>

</div>The melee attack one-roll system puts priority on avoidance, with hit having the lowest priority. A warrior using Recklessness gets 100% crit chance, but you can still get misses, blocks, glancings etc. (in fact, against a warrior with shield block, you won't get any white crits!)<br>
<br>
Seeing misses and blocks with 100% crit chance should not be any surprise whatsoever. Avoidance cancels crits under both a one-roll and a two-roll system; in the former you are pushing crits off the hit table, in the latter if you fail the first roll (you miss) you never get the chance to roll for crit.</div>

		<div id="post_message_661715">Ok, I'm going to go out on a limb here and declare that we can't yet be absolutely sure what the mechanics of the miss/hit/crit table are in terms of one-roll versus two-roll.  Even if the tests under weird and/or buggy situation seems to point to one particular result, we can't be sure that result really applies to normal conditions, or whether it is the result of being in a weird and/or buggy situation.<br>
<br>
Ideally, someone at Blizzard would come clean and explain the whole mess.  Since that's probably not going to happen, I assert that this is the best test we can hope for:<br>
<br>
Fire thousands of autoshots at some target with a high miss rate and high crit rate.  Analyze the numbers.<br>
<br>
Perhaps, take a level 64 hunter out to meet Dr. Boom.  That's a 12% miss rate, right?  Gear the hunter with lots of crit gear, but no hit gear.  If the hunter has a 20% paper doll crit rate, that's a 16% crit rate against a target 4 levels above him.  (Apologies if these numbers are wrong.  They're from memory, and I'm only using them as an example).<br>
<br>
Fire a lot of shots.  5,000 would be enough.  More would be better.  Fewer would probably be OK.  Feel free to calculate intervals of confidence.<br>
<br>
Look at the numbers.  If you get 16% crit, 12% miss, and 72% hit, it's a single-roll system.  If you get 14% crit, 12% miss, and 74% hit, it's a two-roll system.    A higher miss rate would separate the two possibilities more and therefore require fewer shots to get a reliable result.  Dueling someone who will put Scorpid Sting and/or Insect Swarm on the test subject might help, although that sure would be tedious.<br>
<br>
I have no idea what to do about blocks, except conclude that mob target attack tables are not the same as player target attack tables (which we already know).  Also, I remember from my youth that ranged attacks against targets much higher in level were sometimes deflected.  I have no idea if that's still in there....  Really, you'd have to run the test over with a different %MISS but the same %CRIT, and see if the count changed on crits and blocks.<br>
<br>
Then, there's the possibility that auto shot and special shots use different attack tables.  Auto and special attacks certainly use different tables for melee.....<br>
<br>
Of course, this requires finding a level 64 hunter, getting him to cooperate, and firing away for around three hours.  I'm not sure who is going to bell that particular cat, but a fast, low-power ranged weapon would sure be a good idea.  Maybe dropping a whole lot of gold on the test subject would be an appropriate thing to do....</div>

</div>Ah, I understand the reasoning.  Thank you.<br>
<br>
Still, there is the possibility that, with full table where %MISS + %CRIT &gt; 100%, misses are put on the actual roll table before crits are, with the extra crit falling off the table.<br>
<br>
Now, if you got %CRIT &lt; 100%, but %MISS + %CRIT  &gt; 100%, and then managed to get all three of crits, hits, <i>and</i> misses, <i>that</i> would be solid evidence of a two-roll system.<br>
<br>
From what I know of Blizzard and of programming, my wild guess is that the correct answer is "none of the above".  There's probably some weird exception in the case of debuffs, and another weird exception in the case of the table going over 100%, with even weirder exceptions when both of those happen at the same time.</div>

		<div id="post_message_662364">So far from testing we have:<br>
if you have a higher crit rate than hit rate you can still get hits. (Lactose i believe)<br>
if you have a &gt; 100% crit rate you can still get misses. (Midnight)<br>
<br>
Those two test suggest that a two roll system is being used. <br>
<br>
I believe Midnight saw something like 3% misses which is probably about what you would expect on a level 68 mob, some blocks, and the rest were crits which would make sense if either miss could not be pushed off the table *or* there is a two roll system.<br>
<br>
Lactose saw that you could still get hits if your crit rate was greater than your hit rate. This tends more towards the two roll system unless there is some other reason for the hits, defense/resilience/level difference on the target, which I don't believe was the case.</div>

		<div id="post_message_662383">I would like to ask your help about Cheeky's spreadsheet. Until today i used an older version and downloaded version 44 today. I loaded my gear and my talents into both version and started to compare ranged weapons, so i could choose which one to use. After every choice i re-generated the shot rotations. I'm 0/21/40 specced, so i went for the 1:1.x rotation in all case.<br>
My problem is the following: <br>
The 2 versions of the spreadsheet shows totally different numbers on dps and i'm confused which weapon to choose. My prefered choice was the Gladiator's crossbow, it won the competition in the older spreadsheet, so i started to farm honor  But in the new version, it's the weakest. Anyone knows why is that? As MM/SV hunter i think i should go for a hard hitting slower weapon and that crossbow is the slowest tbc epic weapon atm. But numbers are confusing, here is the list of weapons and the results in dps with the old and with the new spreadsheet:<br>
<br>
Wrathtide old: 745<br>
Wrathtide new: 768<br>
<br>
Steelhawk old: 733<br>
Steelhawk new: 802<br>
<br>
Gyro old: 722<br>
Gyro new: 789<br>
<br>
Sunfury old: 759<br>

2.4 badge reward old: 767<br>

</div>I still think all tests of this kind can by manipulated by blizzard's weird calculation, but this at least make sure that the typical 1-roll system isn't used.<br>
<br>
Sadly, it doesn't necessarily mean that crits can be misses... as long as we doesn't know anything about blizzards calculations we can just imagine systems and hope that they reflect the truth.<br>
<br>
The problem is: As long as we can't surely say the one-roll or two-roll system exists, we maybe base all our tests on wrong assumptions!<br>
Because of this, I think the best way to solve the problem is a very huge test with a lot of shots.</div>

</div>Notice that there are no crits at all, though!  Using a pure two-roll system, there should be both hits and crits here.  We don't have the whole story, yet.  Blizzard is up to something funny.  My guess is that there is something weird about the way debuffs that make you miss are calculated into the system, such that they eliminate crits.  That could happen under both a two-roll and one-roll system.<br>
<br>
To make it worse, Blizzard could still do something under a two-roll system to give you a consistent number of crits, regardless of your %hit.<br>
<br>
Here's one weird way they could do it:  Imagine that you have a hit% of 60% and a crit% of 30%.<br>
Roll 1:  1-60: Go to roll 2.  61-100:  Miss.<br>
Roll 2:  1-50: Crit.  51-100: Hit.<br>
<br>
End result:  30% crit, 30% hit, 40% miss on a two-roll system, with exactly the same percentages as we'd get in a one-roll system.<br>
<br>
What is meaningful is that we have an example of a blocked crit on a special.  That strongly indicates that blocks and crits are on separate rolls for ranged specials.<br>
<br>
We need more data.  Blizzard does so much weird stuff that two extreme examples don't give us the whole story.</div>

</div>There isn't any precedent or evidence to suggest this though, you just came up with a "wierd way" to do things.  Which doesn't make any sense, why would the second crit/hit roll be 50/50?.<br>
<br>
<b>For every other combat table miss chance makes up a component that can be reduced, hit chance by itself cannot be increased.</b>  This is an important distinction.<br>
<br>
Look at Lactose's log snippet again.<br>
<br>
He is firing at a lvl 70 monster so he has ~5% base miss rate.  Miss has the highest priority in other attack table generation so, in a one roll system, before the curse he would have:<br>
<br>
~5% Miss<br>
~5% Block<br>
~35.5% Crit<br>
<br>
The rest is hit by default (hit chance is purely determined by the first three percentages).<br>
<br>
After the curse is applied, in a one roll system, he would have:<br>
<br>
~71% Miss<br>
~5% Block<br>
~24% Crit<br>
<br>
He has a 0% hit chance since it is purely determined by the other percentages, even part of his crit is pushed off the table.  However he still got hits, this is impossible if Crit and Miss are on the same table.<br>
<br>
So, in a two roll system before the curse he would have:<br>
<br>
~5% Miss<br>
~5% Block<br>
~90% Hit (of those hits, ~35.5% will Crit, effectively ~32%)<br>
<br>
After the curse, in a two roll system, he would have:<br>
<br>
~71% Miss<br>
~5% Block<br>
~24% Hit (of those hits, ~35.5% will Crit, effectively ~8.5%)<br>
<br>
This is very similar to the way it works for spells and is the logical conclusion given the log snippet.  You can make up all kinds of nonsensical ways to account for the misses but you can't explain why it would happen that way, or demonstrate a precedent.</div>

</div>It did change the crit rate, in Lactose's test a 1 roll system would have only produced crits, the crit rate was reduced by the two roll mechanic, allowing hits.<br>

Edit: The only thing garnered from the test was demonstrating crit and hit are on independent rolls.  We structured those rolls based on how spell tables are generated.  It could be some whacky other way, but that is highly unlikely.</div>

</div>That's exactly what I want to say, too. <br>
<br>
Don't try to test 1- or 2-roll-systems as long as you don't even know if exactly this system is used!<br>
<b>Just test whether your critchance is reduced by misschance.</b><br>
Nothing else.<br>
The simplest and only way to check this is a huge test with 10.000 and more shots.<br>
Of course there is a chance that the result ist wrong. But as long as this chance is very low (&lt;1% or something like this) we can be quite sure. Feel free to even calculate the chance of the result being wrong.<br>
<br>

How did the caster find out that their spells are using a 2-roll-system?<br>
If they have reliable calculations that the 2-roll-system works this way and no other, (there can be a LOT of alternatives) we can do tests like these.<br>
To my knowledge they only know that misses reduces their critchance and don't know whether 2 rolls are used!</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Perhaps, take a level 64 hunter out to meet Dr. Boom.  That's a 12% miss rate, right?  Gear the hunter with lots of crit gear, but no hit gear.  If the hunter has a 20% paper doll crit rate, that's a 16% crit rate against a target 4 levels above him.  (Apologies if these numbers are wrong.  They're from memory, and I'm only using them as an example).<br>
<br>
Of course, this requires finding a level 64 hunter, getting him to cooperate, and firing away for around three hours.  I'm not sure who is going to bell that particular cat, but a fast, low-power ranged weapon would sure be a good idea.  Maybe dropping a whole lot of gold on the test subject would be an appropriate thing to do....</div>

	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>Wouldn't it also be possible for a level 70 to go out, keep their crit% static (or as close to it as possible) but change their hit% and see if their crit% goes up?  Violet Signet of the Master Assasin comes to mind.  Any other easily obtainable gear that has HR but no agi or CR?  Maybe putting a cenarian helm enchant on some crappy 'of the owl' green?  It'd cost less than paying a level 64 1k for his time.<br>
<br>
That would give us a test without any buffs or debuffs on the target or player that potentially change how things work.</div>

</div>Well, that says a lot.  If you're getting both crits and hits with a 66% miss debuff, it can't be using a standard single-roll table in that situation.  With that %miss, either %crit or %hit would push the other off the table.<br>
<br>
I still would like to see a big statistical test, so we <i>know</i> we have the full story.<br>

</div>The problem with that is that Dr. Boom is level 68, leaving only a base 3% miss rate for a level 70 hunter.  With an adjusted 20% crit rate, and firing 1,000 shots, that's the difference between 200 and 194 crits.  That is well within normal random variation.<br>
<br>
In other words, with a 70, you'd have to fire a hell of a lot of shots to make the results statistically meaningful.<br>
<br>
With a level 64, though, you'd get a base 12% miss rate.  The difference with 1000 shots and a 20% adjusted crit rate would be expected values of 200 or 176.  You'd need far fewer shots to overcome random variation.<br>
<br>
Where the heck is Olgas?  This sort of thing is right up her alley....</div>

</div>The first thing you need to do is enable macros in your spreadsheet. For example, if you use Office 2007, you should see a bar dropdown from the toolbar saying that macro content is blocked. Click the button and unblock it.<br>
<br>
If you use a 2003 or older version, I dont know where the warning appears... but I'm sure it would be easy to enable macros if you're looking for it.</div>

</div>First thing first, Cheek's doesn't model macros it models rotations, generally. <br>
<br>
I notice you are survival specced, as such the bottom line is that a spam rotation (/cast macros) are not supported by Cheeky's Spreadsheet for either SV or MM specs.<br>
<br>
Using any /castsequence macro will result in a substantial DPS loss <b><u>PROVIDING</u></b> you can get away with using a /cast macro without chaining steadys. Something which annoyingly is completely random depending on many factors. Best guess at the moment is that to avoid chaining steadys you actually need some lag, you need to spam at a rate of anything between 5 and 20 inputs per second so a G15 becomes a requirement for playing WoW, you need to remove KC from any macro, you need to have found a 4 leaf clover, you need to be Irish. You get the picture.<br>
<br>
If you just want to see the highest DPS shown by the spreadsheet simply use the 1:1.X button with both AS and MS enabled. This assumes perfect manual input and still ends up at a disadvantage to using a successful /cast macro. <br>
<br>
Until we get a 2:1 spam rotation model you won't see in game representation I'm afraid, the reason being is that according to Cheeky's own work the /cast macros result in a "hidden" averaged haste bonus of circa 11.55%. If you can get 2 Steadys to every Auto using a /cast macro go and thank whatever stars you consider to be lucky and don't worry about spreadsheets for rotations. For gear choices Cheeky's is Godly.</div>

I understand that the spreadsheet models rotations. In the latest version he added an option to define how the macro works. Castsequence. spam, and another option i dont remember atm. You can find it right next to the latency choice. <br>
<br>
I used the 1.5:1 rotation for a long time. In order to maintain the accuracy of the rotation it requires a castsequence macro which tends to be fairly long because you have to do the whole rotation up until the point where Arcane and Multi are back up at the same time. Any interruption resets this macro to the begining and then it wont be in sync with your shot timers for a little bit.<br>
<br>
 With the recent changes that inspired the discussion of 3:2 macros I thought I would try a different way to do the 1.5:1 macro. The one I posted above is very close and works fine except that in a situation where both arcane and multi are up the rotation looks like this:<br>
<i>auto,steady,arcane,auto,steady,multi. </i><br>
<br>
Whereas the 1.5:1 rotation from the spreadsheet looks like this:<br>
<i>auto,steady,arcane,auto,steady,auto,steady,multi</i>. <br>
<br>
Since that changes the shot timings significantly I manually entered it into the spreadsheet to compare the damage.  It also has the net benefit of not being tied to shot timings because it fits arcane, multi in when they are ready not in a predetermined order.<br>
<br>
Which brings us back to my original question phrased a little differently.  Does the castsequence setting in the spreadsheet assume that the whole shot rotation is in a castsequence? I ask because it could possibly make the rotation i've created look worse/better than it actually is If i set it to either castsequence or spam as it has elements of both methods.</div>

</div>Aye, we all used a 1:1.5 rotations for a long time. Now what I am tring to say here is that we need to think out of the box. The new mechanics have dealt us as Survival Hunters a shitty hand, well in some cases at least. In order to deliver the ultimate DPS this is the new order, with inevitable caveats.<br>
<br>
1) Use a /Cast Auto /Cast Steady macro to create a Steady-Steady-Auto (2:1) rotation<br>
2) Hand-Weave 1-1:5 using either an Improved Arcane Shot rotation or a Full Arcane Shot//Multi Rotation<br>
3) Use a Castsequence macro<br>
<br>
1) The /cast macros deliver upto circa 200 additional DPS over /castsequence macros due to a double whammy effect. The way the client side // server side mechanics have turned out we get an 11.55% hidden haste bonus, woohoo, <b><u>IF</u></b> you can use the macro without chaining Steadys. Go shoot 100 arrows at boom and confirm you get 66 33 Steadys to Autos ish, if so you are one of the lucky ones. The totally added bonus to using this macro is that we drop automatically to a 1:1 rotation under haste conditions woohoo 2. no trying to accomodate shot rotation changes on the fly. Haste rotations are how we as Survival or MM for that matter can actually get close to BM DPS.<br>
<br>
2) If you chain Steadys, which is totally random then next best DPS option is to Hand-Weave to your hearts content using your prefered 1:1.5 rotation. Using Quartz or similar you can in theory eliminate the effects of latency by hitting your rotation at the start of the red bit of the cast bar. Also assuming you can stand watching cast bars for 4 hours every night during raids.<br>
<br>
3) If the answer to both 1+2 above is negative then you are left with the option of a /Castsequence Macro. This is still very viable if you have a latency range of say 30 - 60 as has always been the case, nothing changed here then. Obviously the double whammy factor comes more into play here as your latncy increases. Lets say for aguments sake that you can use /cast macro without chaining, you have just increased your DPS over a perfect Hand Woven Rotation by say 10%, now when we compare this to using a Castsequence macro (as you do) with say 200 latency we have now increased our DPS by 20%!!!<br>

Whereas the 1.5:1 rotation from the spreadsheet looks like this:<br>
<i>auto,steady,arcane,auto,steady,auto,steady,multi</i>. .</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>Now this is an area where we as SV and or MM hunters have been slacking. There is no such thing as a 3:2 macro. It is a /cast macro. Now when the BM guys use the macro it turns out they get very roughly 60 Steadys for 40 Autos, we as SV or MM get 66 Steadys for 33 Autos. The /Cast macro is not modelled in Cheeky's Spreadheet for a 2:1 rotation no matter how you try to cut it for SV or MM. Now Cheeky is on record as saying the mechanics ar that F***D up at the moment that he was thinking of quitting modelling Hunter DPS. I fully understand this sentiment. We all have to hope that come 2.4 we get a stable mechanic that allows reasonable modelling, if we ever geet to find out wha Blizz's intntion actually is.<br>
<br>
As for the speciffic rotation quesion, using /Castrandom is a very efficient way of including additional Arcanes or Multis, however it not modelable. I don't really understand what it is you are trying to get at. The 1 1:5 rotation for me looks like ...A,S,M,A,S,A,S,Ar,A,S,A,S,Ar,A,S repeat<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Since that changes the shot timings significantly I manually entered it into the spreadsheet to compare the damage.  It also has the net benefit of not being tied to shot timings because it fits arcane, multi in when they are ready not in a predetermined order.<br>
<br>
Which brings us back to my original question phrased a little differently.  Does the castsequence setting in the spreadsheet assume that the whole shot rotation is in a castsequence? I ask because it could possibly make the rotation i've created look worse/better than it actually is If i set it to either castsequence or spam as it has elements of both methods.</div>

</div>Indeed the elements of both that you refer to are why its not modelled or modelable. <br>
<br>
Bottom line is drop the /Castsequence if you can, if not.... <br>
<br>
/castsequence reset=3 !Auto Shot, Steady Shot<br>
/castrandom Arcane Shot, Multi-Shot<br>
<br>
Is absolutely fine, just don't expect the spreadsheet to offer a rotation that fits what you see in game using it.</div>

</div>I don't see why there should be a difference between a pure /castsequence and the mixed macro.<br>
With the mixed macro you still got the disadvantage of the /castsequence after the autoshot - you still have to wait for the autoshot to fire at your computer before the steadyshot starts.<br>
And after the steadyshot both a pure castsequence and the mixed makro have to wait for your GCD, because the steadyshot finishes about 200ms before the GCD. As long as you have less as 200ms ping, the pure castsequence wouldn't be worse/slower.<br>
<br>
So actually the mixed macro is not really behaving different than a pure castsequence(as long as you may spam it) and the mixed macro is just written in a shorter way..<br>
<br>
so: -&gt; castsequence-option of the sheet should simulate the macro best. (+manually fitting in the shots)<br>
<br>
<b>Another Post/Edit:</b><br>
<br>
so.. back to the wind serpent <br>
I was a bit puzzled that the 'RAP to spelldmg'-scaling is quite bit lower than that of my own observation, that I did ~9 month ago -  in numbers: 1,25% (sheet) instead of 1,4%-1,5%(own old experiment).<br>
<br>
So I tried the whole thing again.. and it seems to be ~1,5% again<br>
<br>
<b>About the test:</b><br>
<br>
In order to get some numbers to work with, I used LB about 80 up to 200(in case I was unsure) times and only remembered the max hit and the min hit. My theory is that this way the numbers shouldn't be dependent from statistic deviation, because the chance that I do not get the maximum and minimum possible hit is quite low.<br>
For this test I assumed that the tooltip values for LB of 101-116 are exactly true, and I assume that for the +dmg by spelldmg is one value, not a range.<br>
Also I assume that WoW rounds up at &gt;= .5 and down at &lt; .5.(but I think a different kind of rounding wouldn't change anything)<br>
The testobjects were my wind serpent with happiness 'content', so 100% dmg and no talents for the pet(SV-specced); the victims were some felboars(lvl 67/68) in SMV. <br>
<b><br>
First test: 2127AP</b><br>
Min hit: 115<br>
So in this case we got  115-101=14 dmg more than the basedmg, so we got 14/2127/0.43=1.5307% scaling.<br>
In case it would only be 114.5 we at least got a minimum for the scaling of 13.5/2127/0.43=1.47603%.<br>
<br>
Max hit: 130<br>
The same numbers:<br>
14/2127/0.43=1.5307%<br>
Min: 13.5/2127/0.43=1.47603%<br>
<br>
<b>Second test*: 1305AP</b><br>
Min hit: 110<br>
9/1305/0.43=1.603%<br>
(more likely) Min: 8.5/1305/0,43=1.5147%<br>
<br>
Max hit: 124<br>
8/1305/0.43=1.425%<br>
Min: 7.5/1305/0.43=1.3365%<br>
In this case we might consider the situation, that the max hit was 124.499..<br>
Max 8.5/1305/0.43=1.5147%<br>
<br>
<b>Third test: 1519AP</b><br>
Min hit: 111<br>
10/1519/0.43=1.5310%<br>
Min: 9.5/1519/0.43=1.4544%<br>
<br>
Max hit: 126<br>
10/1519/0.43=1.5310%<br>
Min: 9.5/1519/0.43=1.4544%<br>
<br>
<b>Fourth test*: 844AP</b><br>
Min hit: 107<br>
6/844/0.43=1.653%<br>
Min: 5.5/844/0.43=1.5155%<br>
<br>
Max hit: 121<br>
5/844/0.43=1.377%<br>
Min: 4.5/844/0.43=1.2399%(^^)<br>
Max: 5.5/844/0.43=1.5155%<br>
<br>
<b>Conclusion:</b><br>
~1.5% RAP to Spelldmg scaling seems to be more accurate.<br>
<b><br>
Additional Observation:</b><br>
*In the second and fourth test the min-max difference was only 14; if the min-value was rounded up at .5 and the max-value down at .4999.. it would be near to 15(what is listed in the tooltip), but actually it could never be 15. I got no Idea what I should with this :/<br>
But I'm quite sure that those numbers are right, because I fried about 3 boars for both test each(~200 hits) with LB only.. <br>
<br>
I was a bit surprised, when I got 3 crits with LB in this test; I always thought pets do not have spellcrit.. could it be that Int even increases the Spellcrit of Pets?</div>

When they nerfed LB they reduced that specific spell's coefficient (It was 100%).<br>
<br>
If the spell does scale at 1.5% that means it has a 12% coefficient, which is an odd number.<br>
<br>
The current 1.25% is derived from tests like yours and the assumption they set the coefficient to something simple and arbitrary, 10%.<br>

In response to the item: thats something you would need to talk to Cheeky (or whoever else happens to be making a spreadsheet for hunter dps) about implementing into their work.<br>
<br>
As for using your trinkets: I personaly use my trinket with BW. The cooldown of RF means that you'll be staggering the use of it between your BW uses (provided that there isnt a period of low-dps or an agro wipe as your cooldowns are up), and to make full use of your trinket's bennifits, you'd want to be using it as much as possible. *If you armory me right now, im not using my "use" trinket. I have Abbacus of Violent Odds for when I need to conserve mana by maxing out autoshot (with DST and ImpAotH). Working on getting Berzerkers Call from ZA*<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_676123"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I have a few questions related to attack speed and latency. Firstly, if I use a macro that forces a 1:1 rotation all the time, at what attack speed do I lose the benefit of further haste? Right now I have a 1.89 attack speed normally, and with quickshots that goes down to 1.64. I also use a DST though, and if they are both active my attack speed is 1.37. I would think that any amount faster than the GCD would be wasted with a 1:1 rotation, since if both steady and auto fire in under 1.5 seconds I still have to wait for the GCD to start another one. But I am not sure if this is the case.<br>
<br>
Secondly, how much of an effect does latency play when using this macro? My latency is normally around 250, which according to Cheeky's spreadsheet should make all of my haste effects really undesirable. It appears to work under the assumption that whenever my shot speed gets to 1.5s + latency, any further haste is wasted. The way I thought it worked was after my steady shot goes off, my auto shot starts casting. And in that .5 second cast time if I try and start another steady shot, the server will queue that shot to start immediately after the auto goes off, thus negating latency. That is how it works, right? So in theory, even with a 250 latency I should be able to benefit from extra haste effects.<br>
<br>
My final question is, how exactly does the macro at the end of this post work. This is the one I use all the time, regardless of how many haste effects I have going. I know it's not optimal, but so long as it's pretty close I'm not too worried about it. However, one thing occurred to me which may mean this macro isn't working the way I wanted it to. Since it forces a 1:1 rotation, does spamming the macro before the autoshot finishes casting do anything? I mean, is it purposely not sending a command to the server to queue a steady shot until my client sees the autoshot go off? If this is the case, then the benefit of server side queuing would not be recognized, and my high latency would indeed be a hindrance when I have multiple haste effects going.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I have a few questions related to attack speed and latency. Firstly, if I use a macro that forces a 1:1 rotation all the time, at what attack speed do I lose the benefit of further haste? Right now I have a 1.89 attack speed normally, and with quickshots that goes down to 1.64. I also use a DST though, and if they are both active my attack speed is 1.37. I would think that any amount faster than the GCD would be wasted with a 1:1 rotation, since if both steady and auto fire in under 1.5 seconds I still have to wait for the GCD to start another one. But I am not sure if this is the case.<br>

<br>
I dont know enough about the latency to shot delay issues to answer your first question. Your second question, however, is the same with or without the latency. If you have a fast enough SS+AS cast time (lower than the global cooldown) there will be some wasted shot time regardless.  See <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080318160326/http://elitistjerks.com/f31/t13107-hunter_shot_rotation_illustrated/" target="_blank">THIS</a> thread and study the charts in the first post. It doesnt specificaly mention haste on the charts, but if you apply it and shorten the steady shot bars, along with adding a GCD bar above the whole thing, you would be able to see the wasted time.<br>
<br>
Your third question: castsequence  - uses the first spell in the sequence the first time the button is pressed, the second spell in the sequence the second time its pressed, and so on. the reset value is how many seconds between presses before the macro resets to the first spell in the sequence<br>
<br>
The kill command line checks for your pet's target and attempts to cast kill command if the target exists. If your pet has no target, it doesnt attempt to cast kill command. The third line is supsoed to clear the errors line on your screen. ("Cant do that yet" when kill command isnt up i think is what its suposed to clear)<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

An other thing: Hunter Basic Statistics tell me I have got 99,50% Hit vs. Level 73, so I am at the cap. (1% Miss is minimum) and still it tells me Hit + 1 would give me 0,436 dps? is that a bug? If I pimp my Gear to 100% Hit the Hit+1 dps value gehts 0,000 though.<br>

		<div id="post_message_676614"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I did some tests on Dr Boom with faster guns to get some consistent data about how my shot rotation macros behave under varying levels of haste.  With this macro<br>
<br>
/castsequence reset=2 Steady Shot, !Auto Shot<br>
/cast [target=pettarget, exists] Kill Command<br>
/script UIErrorsFrame:Clear()<br>
<br>
and a starting cast time of 1.89 seconds, I found all further haste effects to have nearly no improvement on my DPS.  Even with a cast time of 1.37 seconds (what I have with DST and QS Procs up) it took me 1.8 seconds per steady:auto rotation.  So this macro doesn't appear to queue the next steady shot, and causes me to lose DPS due to lag.  When I changed to this 3:2 macro<br>
<br>
/cast !Auto shot<br>
/cast [target=pettarget, exists] Kill Command<br>
/cast Steady Shot<br>
/script UIErrorsFrame:Clear()<br>
<br>
I did see the results I wanted.  Even though it is normally a 3:2 macro, under most haste effects it performed a perfect 1:1 rotation, and gave me the lag negation benefit.  My fastest rotation with a 1.37 cast time was 1.53 seconds, which seems to indicate having a shot time under 1.5 seconds reduces the benefit of further haste effects, unless you start using other shots besides steady.<br>
<br>
The problem is, under my normal attack speed of 1.89 seconds, the 3:2 macro doesn't provide any DPS benefit, but it does drain my mana a lot faster.  It seems like a 1:1 rotation is always the best for me, but I can't use the first castsequence macro under haste because I lose so much time due to lag.  So is there any better macro that can still force a 1:1 rotation, but send the command to the server to queue the next steady before the auto goes off?  I guess I could just switch macros whenever I have a haste effect up, but if there is a better way I would like to know about it.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Just use your spells by hand, this provides the best dps.<br>
(On a sidenote, this is exactly what blizzard wants: Macros provide good dps, but not best!).<br>
<br>
You have 0.5 seconds before the auto shot goes out, this is enough to prevent mistakes.<br>
It isn't as stressful as pre 2.3 to time your shots without an macro.<br>
Actually, it's very easy. I doesn't even need to look at my quartz bar, it's just a question of habituation.<br>
<br>
An addition, I'm using a trick for huge hastebuffs:<br>
<br>
For the normal 1:1 rotation with aspect-procc and / or Drums of Battle, I have <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28581" target="_blank">[Wolfslayer Sniper Rifle]</a> equiped.<br>
For Rapid Fire, Heroism and / or Haste potions, I change to my slowest weapon, <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=29949" target="_blank">[Arcanite Steam-Pistol]</a>.<br>
<br>
This way, I can benefit better of the haste effects.<br>
<br>
The Problem is, that changing equip starts the GCD... I solve this problem by starting steadyshot ~ *lag* seconds before my auto goes off and changing my weapons with a simple macro <i> ( /equip Wolfslayer Sniper Rifle /equip Arcanite Steam-Pistol) </i> instantly after this..<br>
Of course there is still a little delay, so you have to start your next steady a bit later.. Don't clip your Auto shot!<br>
<br>
Because of this delay, you should try to change your weapons as rarely as possible. Chaining haste effects at the start of the encounter or using encounter revealing breaks to change weapons are the two options I use.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_678899"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Hey guys,<br>
Was wondering about lightning breath and pet crit rate in the spreadsheet.<br>
From what I can tell in the spreadsheet is using the the same crit rate for Lightning Breath that is used for other melee attacks (if I'm wrong, stop me right here)<br>
<br>
Lightning Breath has a 0% crit rate as it is a spell (and pet's get 0% spell crit from int, unless they are caster pets but that's digressing a bit to far for now). If you mouse over Int in the pet window you'll see it has 0% spell crit rate, which my WWS logs agree with.<br>
<br>
This is skewing the results in the spreadsheet highly in favor of WindSerpents, and especially for BM hunters who not only have incorrect pet dps reported (with ~15% crit rate applied to LB), but also have the proc rate for Frenzy and Ferocious Inspiriation boosted.<br>
<br>
----------EDIT----------<br>
NM me, I'm just being an idiot. The spreadsheet correctly sets a 0% crit rate for LB, and then adds Feroicity to this up to a 10% crit rate. I have just spec'd BM and not taken Ferocity into account when I was looking at the spreadsheet. D'oh!<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Two Things:<br>
<br>
Beyond the custom item tab is there any plan to impliment the Gauntlets of Rapidity into the scroll down selection on the character equipment tab?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
More importantly, there's been discussion on my guild forums concerning the raw DPS values of certain buffs and talents. Unless i've been misreading your Spreadsheet anything that effects mana longevity increases time to exhaustion only, but does not calculate this as a raw DPS number.<br>
<br>
Example:<br>
<br>
Arcane Intellect, Blessing of Wisdom, Mana Spring Totem ( BoK, MoTW, Draenic Wisdom, etc ) increase mana pool longevity but they have no hard DPS numbers attributed to them like, say, Blessing of Might. It would be nice if a raw or estimated value could be calculated out of these buffs, because ultimately they do impact DPS beyond the ability to sustain. ( Sustaining and the DPS contribution to sustaining would be distinct numbers. ) I'd say the same for Spirit, but we generally seem to fall outside of the basic rule.<br>
<br>
This approaches Thrill of the Hunt: beyond Mp5, is there a raw dps translation of the talent? I would think this possible to calculate based on the two roll system which concerns on proc effects, sorta, but not quite like, Expose Weakness.<br>
<br>
<br>

</div>I know what you are looking for, but it's not DPS that gets effected, but total damage dealt. One thing the spreadsheet isn't is a combat simulator. I do not try and tell you what will happen DPS wise at time X of a fight. I don't think I'm smart enough to create such a tool that would be generally useful. What it does is give you an instantaneous DPS snapshot in an infinite-length fight when you can maintain the specified rotation.<br>
<br>
What you can glean is how long you can keep plugging away. The buffs you mentioned increase that time. If you know you have a 10 minute fight ahead of you, you can show how different buffs can get you there. (Potions aren't really modeled, but I'm thinking of adding them for this purpose.)<br>
<br>
Hopefully that clarifies my purpose a bit better.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Aye, you're right. Worked it out and it's less that 1/10 of a percent increase in FI uptime.<br>
<br>
Attacks per 10 seconds:<br>
Normal: 9.62<br>
LB: 5.26<br>
KC: 1.77<br>
<br>
That means LB accounts for 32.6% of my pets attacks and Normal &amp; KC for 81.4%<br>
<br>
So 68% of attacks at 14.4% crit and 32% of attacks at 10% crit gives an combined average crit rate of 13.01%<br>
which drops effective benefit by an insignifigant 0.07%<br>
<br>
However, (and sorry to be a pain). The FI/Frenzy procs also don't take into account the extra crit chance from Focused Fire. With a normal pet (not a WS) including the Extra 20% crit for KC increases my effective benefit from 2.77 to 2.85. That's works out at almost 1 dps difference!!<br>
<br>
So yeah, I can see why you've not included either of them in the calculations.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_679096"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->As far as the general spreadsheet. I was wondering if we could get some additions to the buffs section. <br>
1) Target Debuffs, Judgment of the Crusader (3% crit)<br>
2) Hunter and Pet Buffs, Improved Sanctity Aura<br>
3) Hunter and Pet Buffs, Ferocious Inspiration (not you). IE another BM hunter in the group. <br>
4) Drums of Battle &amp; Drums of War. (possibly put an "uptime" value on it. Sometimes I will be in a 4 leather worker group, which it has 100% uptime, other times it only has a 50%, via only 2 leather workers being in the group)<br>
5) Blood Lust?<br>
<br>
Not quite sure how blood lust or the drums would work since the model only works for 50 shots, usually only lasting a max of a minute. <br>
<br>
I also PM'ed the following to the thread creator, but would just like to post it here, and add to it. <br>
<br>
Some item stats are incorrect when it comes to the current v44 spreadsheet. Hope v45 fixes these issues, but it is not out yet, so who knows.<br>
<br>
Spreadsheet Listed:<br>
Gronnstalker's Boots: 30 agi, 30 stam, 21 int, 86 ap, 28 crit, 98 pen<br>
Gronnstalker's Belt: 29 agi, 36 stam, 17 int, 86 ap, 25 crit, 140 pen<br>
Gronnstalker's Bracer: 23 agi, 25 stam, 16 int, 64 ap, 22 haste<br>
<br>
Actual: <a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?itemset=669" target="_blank">Gronnstalker's Armor - Item Sets - World of Warcraft</a> Or at least I believe wowhead is accurate on this.<br>
Gronnstalker's Boots: 30 agi, 21 stam, 21 int, 86 ap, 21 crit, 14 hit, 140 pen<br>
Gronnstalker's Belt: 29 agi, 21 stam, 17 int, 86 ap, 19 crit, 24 hit, 140 pen<br>
Gronnstalker's Bracer: 23 agi, 16 stam, 16 int, 64 ap, 17 crit, 112 pen<br>
<br>
Also "Mantle of the Golden Forest" is missing from the shoulder list, along with "Band of Ruinous Delight" on the ring list. Stats could be found: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080320032000/http://www.worldofraids.com/burning_crusade/ptr-24/sunwell-plateau/" target="_blank">World of Raids :: Sunwell Plateau</a> .  Hope that is accurate too.<br>
<br>
I did not check the threads to see if some of the above was addressed. I did check for a few of the others on the other hand and was unable to find anything about it.<br>

I went and picked up a <a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?npc=5708" target="_blank">Spawn of Hakkar (lvl 49)</a> from Sunken Temple, leveled him to 50 and spent some time attacking a lvl 53 Servant of Grol. After 672 casts of Lightning Breath, I got the following results:<br>

Resists: <br>
76 (11,31%) -&gt; expected: 13% (assuming Animal Handler gives 4% spell hit as the spreadsheet does)<br>
<br>
I know the number of casts is a bit low (unfortunately the pet ran off after some time because I didn't feed it... yeah, im evil ), but the crit rate seems a bit on the low side... is it possible Wind Serpents have a negative base spell crit chance, much like hunters have a negative base dodge chance? <br>

I know the number of casts is a bit low (unfortunately the pet ran off after some time because I didn't feed it... yeah, im evil ), but the crit rate seems a bit on the low side... is it possible Wind Serpents have a negative base spell crit chance, much like hunters have a negative base dodge chance? <br>
<br>
I plan to tame me a Son of Hakkar from ZG and do some testing with the Gordok Spirits in Dire Maul for some more data (at least those don't fight back... )</div>

	</tbody></table>
</div>Do you have the breakdown between full and partial resists? I'd also assume the +3 level difference has a negative impact on crit chance. I don't currently model for that, but I'm betting I can get the information from any caster Theorycrafting site.<br>

		<div id="post_message_679931"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I have what may sound like a rookie question, but here goes.  In the spreadsheet the default gems loaded into the waist item for yellow socket is always the wicked noble topaz.  In my case my hit is only at 82, or 95.95%.  I find if I put in the Glinting Noble Topaz instead of the wicked, I get a bit more dps calculated.  Here is my question.  Is this higher dps only considering the assumption I am attacking the level 73 target the hit percentage is based upon?  In other words, if I am in pvp against another lvl 70 player, wouldn't my dps be higher with the Wicked, not the glinting like the spreadsheet shows?  <br>
<br>
If someone can explain the significance hit % has in the spreadsheets calc I would appreciate the education.  I don't mind loading up on glinting gems as long as they truly will boost my dps.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

For the Resto/Elem optimization of my shaman, I use Binkenstein's spreadheet.<br>
One feature I particularly like, is the way he "ranks" items by slot, depending on their DEP / HEP (Damage / Healing Equivalence Points), the weight of each stat depending on the gear you currently have selected.<br>
<br>
I noticed on the Result &amp; Settings sheet that you give an Equivalence system for each stat, based on the gear currently equipped. This might be too much work, but are your items lists built in the same way, so that you could give one DEP value for each item, and eventually sort items (maybe in drop down menus), from the highest DEP to the lowest one ?<br>
<br>
This has been said several times already, but the work you have done, together with Lactose, Glau and all the active actors of this thread, is highly appreciated by the hunter and theorycrafter's community.<br>

Fantastic work, BTW, really amazing effort.  Thanks!  I'm not seeing exactly the right stamina calculation, and I think it's because the Gear page isn't pulling in the 5% to stamina from talents in cell F92.  I hope I'm not missing something obvious like a Noob.<br>
<br>
&lt;Edit&gt; Correction--it's not the talent, it's a gear error. Stamina is correct hand-calculated as 107 base + 176 from gear and gem=283, but the spreadsheet is not pulling in the +12 stamina on Resonating Axe.  Easy enough to work around with Custom Gear, but thought you'd like to adjust.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>That'd be great.

</div>You're quite right in that it currently normalizes everything to DPS, and so you can calculate the effectiveness of each piece by multiplying through by the respective DPS coefficient.<br>
<br>
I guess I just prefer looking at it normalized to a single in-game stat, like say AP, since that makes thinking about gear a little easier.  It gives me rules of thumb that I can use in game, such as 1 hit &gt;= 1 haste &gt;= 1 agi = 7 pen &gt;= 1 crit = 2 AP.  So effectively the same as it is now, just perhaps easier to read.  Maybe that's just me.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Heh, I had forgotten all about the Calc Attributes button, Cheeky.  It fills out the table perfectly.  Thank you much.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>If you completely clear out the Shot Rotation tab, you can select trinkets and abilities in it. Most on-use trinkets are modeled, and The Beast Within is too. Then pick your rotation until the effects wear off and leave the rest blank. Ratio the uptime to your normal DPS (for these tests I recommend turning off the "average out" options) and viola! Disclaimer - It doesn't do anything for looking at Pet DPS.<br>
<br>
Hmm, I guess I could add Bloodlust/Heroism in there too the same way. I probably won't, but I could.<br>
<br>
It was a real pain in the ass to put all that logic into the spreadsheet in the first place (it works for all rotations, I believe) so if anyone gets some use out of it I won't feel like a wasted several days of my life for nothing.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
When modeling shot rotations, if the shot is highlighted in green, does that mean it's been clipped?<br>
<br>
What is the difference between a 1:1 (Priority) and the 1:1.5 rotation?  Does the 1st mean that you alternate a auto with a special/steady, and the second mean that you use a auto unless a special/steady shot is available?<br>
<br>
Why is there no buttons for 1:1.5 or 3:2 in the DST tab?  Are those rotations completely unfeasible at that much haste?<br>
<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I have some questions on the spreadsheet.  Be patient and use small words please <br>
<br>
When modeling shot rotations, if the shot is highlighted in green, does that mean it's been clipped?<br>
<br>
What is the difference between a 1:1 (Priority) and the 1:1.5 rotation?  Does the 1st mean that you alternate a auto with a special/steady, and the second mean that you use a auto unless a special/steady shot is available?<br>
<br>
Why is there no buttons for 1:1.5 or 3:2 in the DST tab?  Are those rotations completely unfeasible at that much haste?<br>
<br>
I love the spreadsheet and use it for gear all the time, but am not sure how to use the shot rotations in it for my gear for optimal dps.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>If the time of the shot is in green, that means it is available to be cast immediately after the previous shot/ability has completed. If it's not green, there will be a delay, or "dead space" in your rotation.<br>
<br>
For the rotations, a 1:1 will only ever put 1 special between 2 Auto Shots. Priority means it will select from Arcane, Steady and Multi based on cooldowns and expected damage each shot can deal.<br>
<br>
I figured if you have a DST proc, you're probably dropping to a 1:1 rotation of some sort. You can still hand build a 1:1.5 or 3:2 rotation by hand if you'd like.<br>
<br>
I would first model exactly what your shot rotation looks like from checking your combat log. Then try using the buttons to use other, more common rotations. You may find a more DPS or mana efficient rotation that way. You can also see how certain gear favors certain rotations (like the incredible synergy between the <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32487" target="_blank">[Ashtongue Talisman of Swiftness]</a> and the 3:2 rotation.)<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I agree that it was a bit unwieldy.  What people are looking for, imo, is a quick and easy equivalence, so they can compare gear.  For example, I have a hard time remembering how armor pen compares to AP for me.  You could normalize each stat to Agility, which would be easy, take only one column, and be useful.  Call it call it Agility Equivalence Points:<br>
<br>
Attribute - DPS - AEP<br>
Agility + 1 = .700 = 1.00<br>
AP + 1 = .300 = 0.43<br>
Hit + 1 = .750 = 1.07<br>
Crit + 1 = .600 = 0.86<br>
Pen + 1 = .099 = 0.14<br>
Haste + 1 = .770 = 1.10<br></div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>AEP - good thing for comparing items and it look great in spreadsheet because dps equivalence calcualate depends on your current gear.<br>
<br>
But there is some trick with Hit because overcaped hit don't bring DPS.<br>
So, need to calculate effective hit for items. <br>
<br>
EffectiveHit = HitCap - CurrentHit + HitEquipedItem<br>
And if ItemHit &gt; EffectiveHit then ItemHit = EffectiveHit<br>
<br>
Where HitEquipedItem - Hit Rating on currently equiped item in same itemslot.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

1) The image at the top is a lvl 60 wind serpent attacking a Gordok Spirit in Dire Maul North for a couple of hours. The resist &amp; crit rates (0,7% and 9,8%) match up pretty well with the expected values (1% and 10%). There were no partial resists; I'm not sure if this is normal for a spell cast against an even level target, or if it has to do with the particular kind of mob - perhaps someone more knowledgable about caster mechanics could shed some on light on that.<br>
<br>
2) For the second test I grabbed my brother's prot paladin to tank a lvl 53 blasted lands servant for about 1,5 hours and attacked it with a lvl 50 wind serpent. As can be seen, the resist rate of 13,3% is again pretty close to the expected 13%, but the crit rate (6,8%) is much lower - this leads me to believe Lightning Breath uses a two roll systems (which would mean 135 or ~7,8% out of 1714 landed LBs were crits). This is still lower than the expected 10%, so additionally there seems to be a lowered crit chance due to level difference.<br>
<br>
3) The image at the bottom shows the partial resists against the lvl 53 servant. I observed a few partially resisted crits, and adding the numbers of 0%, 25%, 50% and 75% resisted LBs together leads to the 1714 landed attacks from 2).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
I'm just curious, I was running with a 1:1 rot (clicked the 1:1 button in the spreadsheet) with Wolfslayer, no haste and my dps on the spread sheet vs Gruul (high armor and mit) was around 941 total. <br>
<br>
Side note: I removed KC because of the lock bug.<br>
<br>
I would normally use a 1:1 macro, in the spreadsheet, so i can watch my timers and the rest of the raid... (Leading)<br>
<br>
/castsequence reset=3 !Auto Shot, Steady Shot<br>
/script UIErrorsFrame:Clear()<br>
<br>
..which would result in my 941 total dps.<br>
<br>
I started playing around with the shot rotation tab a bit and switching weapons out. When i switched to the Sunfury and moved to the 3:2 rotation, in the spreadsheet, this time..<br>
<br>
/console Sound_EnableSFX 0<br>
/cast !Auto Shot<br>
/cast Steady Shot<br>
/console Sound_EnableSFX 1<br>
/script UIErrorsFrame:Clear()<br>
<br>
..and that upped my dps to 945 total.<br>
<br>
So next i tried the 1:1.5, 1:1.X in the spreadsheet, still with the Sunfury and my dps jumped up to 977. I was surprised. The macro that would represent that is..<br>
<br>
/console Sound_EnableSFX 0<br>
/castsequence reset=3 !Auto Shot, Steady Shot<br>
/castrandom Arcane Shot<br>
/console Sound_EnableSFX 1<br>
/script UIErrorsFrame:Clear()<br>
<br>
I guess my question is 2 fold.<br>
<br>
1) Is this correct? Would just adding arcane into my rot add that much DPS?<br>
<br>
2) Do the macros i have provided accurately portray what the spreadsheet is trying to do?<br>
<br>
Thanks again for the help.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I recently tried manually creating a rotation to try and match my macro. I became concerned when i noticed the difference in dps by adjusting the Macro setting on the shot rotation page. Would you mind explaining how the various options work for this? For example does Castsequence assume that all shots in the rotation are in a castsequence?</div>

</div>Yeah, those controls are pretty simple. It gets too complicated trying to work through all the permutations. If you got something a little bit different you are doing you can use the spreadsheet for average shot damages, and compute your own shot frequencies for expected DPS.<br>

<br>
As far as hunter weapons go, they are not nearly as good as most of the other high end weapons, but that set bonus intrigues me greatly. <br>
<br>
If anyone knows anything about how it works, if it works on ranged attacks(main one), and how often it procs.. I would be extremely interested in it!<br>
<br>
Pretty sure if it procs off ranged attacks.. might be an interesting thing to play around with now that there is so much haste around ^^<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>No. With our current mechanics modeling all possible haste effects is too ugly. I'd need all kinds of new rotations in order to make it accurate at all. For now you can custom add in 80 haste rating on your Gear tab, record DPS, and ratio it against your base DPS based on the number of Drums you get per 2 minutes.<br>

		<div id="post_message_690619"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->A few notes:<br>
<br>
1)  I think you may need the FLOOR function for the post buff agility calculation.  With Lightning Reflexes, the actual agility is 802.7.  The tooltip for me shows a 802 agility.  The spreadsheet shows 803.  That being said, I'm not entirely sure how far WoW carries the decimal point internally so it may be that 803 is a more accurate representation.<br>
<br>
2)  On the Settings and Results tab, in the saved profile section, the Spec column still occasionally shows the 5 digit number rather than the nn/nn/nn spec definition.  Minor but that bug has popped up again.<br>
<br>
I think that's about it for now :-)<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Also, the load/save buffs buttons don't save the AP value from a pet's custom buffs, even when saving and loading within the same spreadsheet (I was trying to simulate the effect of Unleashed Rage on a pet by just putting 10% of its AP in custom buffs line - it would be sweet if you could just make Unleashed Rage one of the pet buffs available, since it does add a fair bit to pet DPS).<br>
<br>
Juggling different group compositions, it looks like for me, in order of increasing DPS, groups are:<br>
<br>
3:2 rotation grouped with Spriest and Resto Shaman: 2049 dps<br>
1:1 rotation grouped with feral druid: 2090 dps<br>
1:1 rotation grouped with warrior and enhancement shaman: 2113 dps<br>
<br>
None of those values consider heroism though, which isn't available in the feral druid group <!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

It seems both versions (Aldor, and Scryer) have an internal cooldown of 45 seconds, and proc quite often after that is up; I had procs in the same 50 seconds of testing, 45 seconds apart. The Aldor version is a 200ap proc for 10 seconds, while the Scryer proc is weaker at a straight arcane blast of 350 damage. This breaks down to about 44 AP static for the Aldor version, and about 7.7dps static for the Scryer version, excluding crits and such.<br>
<br>
What you'll have to do is have 2 versions of the neck, for example, "Shattered Sun Pendant of Might (Aldor)" and "Shattered Sun Pendant of Might (Scryer)". Should be simple enough to do, although reading it from the armory would be impossible I imagine. But as long as people are sure to change it by hand it shouldn't be a problem.<br>
<br>
For me personally, being Aldor makes this an actual upgrade for me. I'll be testing it tonight in a full raiding situation, but from what I'm seeing on Dr. Boom it's promising.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Well 230 AP for 20s every 45s is 102 AP average if my napkin math is right. So on the custom gear line in the spreadsheet, enter 102 AP, and set the trinket slot you'd put it in to None, and you have I think a decent model for it (assuming it procs immediately once the cooldown is up).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I am by no means anything near proficient in modelling this kind of thing, but reading the melee thread, it think it just means that your chance to proc on an instant is different from your chance to proc on an auto. For the special the % chance to proc is just the same as how the spreadsheet has it now, 1.5 / (60 /3.0) = 7.5%. But for autos its uses the hasted attack speed in the calculation, and this is updated every time your haste changes (RF, bloodlust, quickshots, dst). So 1.5 / (60 / 2.14) = 5.35% with SS and some passive haste on the same 3.0 weapon.<br>
<br>
So if your current model of Madness (<b>and for that matter DST and other PPM effects</b>) uses the same chance to proc on both specials and attacks, the model would need to be changed to use one (constant) chance to proc for specials, and a different (varying) one for autos.<br>
<br>
This all came about when I was wondering why the rogue spreadsheets seem to value Madness a lot lower than ours when they attack faster than we, and our spreadsheet was claiming a 57% uptime on the proc for me (which I don't think I'm getting )<br>
<br>
All the melee testing seems to refer to instants btw, not specials, but I'd hope steadyshot would count as the same type of attack for proc mechanics as sinister strike.<br>

</div>Well, if we're trying to just estimate the number of procs per minute, yeah 1.5 might work, since the 1 PPM on autos combined with slightly higher chance to proc per special probably push the observed number of procs per minute back up to around 1.5. But since the spreadsheet tries to model stuff instead of just estimating it would be cool to do it here too <!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_704985"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Been wondering about the "Shot Statistics" section of the Settings and Results page.<br>
<br>
Everything on this page takes into account the target mobs armor (including sunder armor stacks, and armor pen.) except for the 4 shots in the "Shot Statistics" section. Note that Kill Command, also in this same section does take into acccount targets armor.<br>
<br>
It's just a bit weird looking at that as I'm informed that my multi-shot does 1800 damage and my Arcane only 1100. When armor is factored in multi-shot actually does &lt;1100. This makes all the damage per mana and % calcs incorrect as well.<br>
<br>
It would be more useful in my humble opinion if these shot damage values showded the damage against the current target, and not damage against a target with 0 armor as they currently do.<br>
<br>
Also, just bumping this:<br>

1 - How special shot frequency affects things, especially items without internal cool downs.<br>
2 - How to account for clipping issues in determining shot frequency as hasted or unhasted. (This is especially troubling with the 3:2 macro where Auto Shots do not fire at the listed character sheet frequency.)<br>

</div>There's a lot of good discussion of the effect of haste on ppm here: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080410051559/http://elitistjerks.com/f40/t15553-proc_per_minute_mechanics_haste/" target="_blank">Proc Per Minute Mechanics &amp; Haste</a><br>
<br>
My current understanding is that haste effects reduce your chance to proc in order to maintain the same ppm from autos -- however, this reduction also carries over to any specials/instants you use while under haste.  That means when Quick Shots procs it makes it less likely that DST (or whatever) will proc off any specials you use while under the effects, reducing your total number of procs (though the procs from autos remains constant).<br>
<br>
To be mostly correct you could probably calculate the ppm for each of the different shot rotation tabs since they're all under different amounts of haste and then use the uptime % you already have to come to a weighted average proc %.  I'm not sure how far off that would be, though -- obviously your shots fired in the 10% of the time you have DST and Quick Shots both active is going to be more than 10% of your total shots fired.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>If you mean having SoE on the hunter somehow buffs the pet, no, I'm fairly certain only the hunter's RAP and stamina buff the pet, not his strength or melee AP. And I think the pet portion of the buff's page does allow SoE, just the hunter portion does not.<br>

If you don't have Imp Mark, setting it on the debuffs tab doesn't change your pet's effective AP?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

how exactly do you model shots under a 3:2?  Do you force the user to use a 3:2 exactly, or do you go by the actual shots/time of macrospam using the /cast !Auto Shot /cast Steady Shot.  I only ask because (as I'm sure you know) as haste increases macrospam quickly becomes a 5:4 macro and approaches 1:1 as auto shot speed approaches 1.5.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

At the moment it's a perfect 3:2 rotation, unlike the most player sees ingame, using their macros.<br>
But Kamma provided an algorithm for calculating the steady:auto ratio.<br>

		<div id="post_message_710209"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I ask because I recently did some similar work to post a guide on the WoW forums, although I'm pretty sure I didn't make it accessible enough to the average forum-goer, so it'll fall through the forums in a day.  The closed form for the actual shot rotation is actually quite simple, and the values look a lot like the work Kamma did.<br>
<br>
Here's the napkin math, with useless events cut out since you won't need them.  I calculated these with an "infinite" spam speed, adding an expected delay of spam speed/2 keeps it simple and approximates well, but isn't quite as pure as I like.<br>
<br>
Time~Event<br>
0 ~ Initial Steady and Auto begin casting ("A0")<br>
.5~ Nil Auto releases.  For the remainder of this section, "An" refers to the time of the beginning casting of an auto shot, it will always release .5 seconds later in the middle of the subsequent Steady channel.<br>
1.5 ~ Second Steady begins casting<br>
1.5+1.5/H ~"A1" time of starting casting of first auto shot<br>
A1+B/H ~ "A2", second Auto begins casting<br>
3.0-A1-B/H ~ "S2", or the spillover GCD time from the second steady.<br>
A2+B/H ~ "A3"=1.5+1.5/H+B/H<br>
4.5-A2-B/H ~ "S3"=4.5-1.5/H-2B/H<br>
A3+B/H ~ "A4"=1.5+1.5/H+2B/H<br>
6.0-1.5/H-3B/H ~ "S4"<br>
<br>
It's easy enough from here to see the function for the "spillover" of GCD time, or <br>
"Sn"=1.5n-1.5/H-(n-1)B/H<br>
<br>
I'm sure you can recreate this easily enough, as this isn't a very good formatting to view it in, as I don't have any suitable software on this computer.<br>

The recursive formula for A(n+1)=A(n)+B/H=1.5+1.5/H+(n-1)B/H<br>
<br>
Note that X(n)=1.5(n+1)-A(n)=1.5n-1.5/H-(n-1)B/H<br>
<br>
We're interested in the event that Steady n+1 is able to begin before event A(n), clipping that auto shot.  As the start time for Steady n+1 is 1.5(n+1), we're interested in the first n at which<br>
<br>
1.5(n+1)&lt;1.5+1.5/H+(n-1)B/H<br>
<br>
or X(n)&lt;0.  So we have<br>
<br>
0&gt;1.5n-1.5/H-(n-1)B/H, or<br>
<br>
<b>n&gt;(2B-3)/(2B-3H)</b>.  Round down to find the number of autos per cycle, add one for the steadies.  (This makes the formula for steadies [3H-3]/[2B-3H])  <br>
<br>
If you want to approximate for spam speed, simply say that each Steady shot will be delayed by nL, where L is the average user delay per steady... probably easiest to estimate it at spam speed/2.  This would set <br>
<br>
0&gt;(1.5+L)n-1.5/H-(n-1)B/H, or <br>

Is the Scorpids DPS really that high or is it incorrect/bugged? Here's a list with my results: (using .47 version)<br>
<br>
- Scorpid, trained max claw&amp;scorpid poison, added in sheet as primary: scorpid poison, secondary: claw, DPS: 74,11(!)<br>
- Cat, trained max claw&amp;bite, added in sheet as primary: bite, secondary: claw, DPS: 53,46<br>
- Ravager, trained max bite&amp;gore, added in sheet as primary: bite, secondary, gore, DPS: 58,73.<br>
<br>
This is all with "Happy" happiness.<br>
<br>
Edit: I also added a Wind Serpent for fun and thats even higher:<br>
- Wind Serpent, trained max bite&amp;LB, added in sheet as primary: bite, secondary: LB, DPS: 93,48(!!)<br>
<br>

I'm currently using Netherbane main hand and Breeching Comet off hand.<br>
<br>
When i tried to enter my off hand in the spreadsheet i only got 3 options in the drop down list: Adamantite dagger, Akil'zon's talon blade and Akuno's blade.  <br>
<br>
In a previous version of the spreadsheet I was able to bring up duel wielding Netherbanes, not sure what has changed.<br>

Also, I'm using a mac, so virtual basic stuff doesn't work, if that is my problem, but all the other drop down list seem to work; so I didn't think that was related.<br>

		<div id="post_message_711937"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->So, I'm working on something special for the Hunter community, but I could use some help from some of the other experts.  I'm working with Cheeky as he has time, but due to his schedule I figured I'd ask around here as well for some of my more bothersome issues to ensure I'm not duplicating work the community has already done.<br>
<br>
First, to double check my HasteModifier calc:<br>
<br>
Total Haste = QuiverMod * GearMod * Serpent'sSwiftness * Rapid * QuickShots * Beserker * Heroism/Bloodlust * etc., correct?  And, the GearMod is TotalHasteRating/15.77 @ Lvl70?  Haste effects the cast times of Steady Shot and Aimed Shot as well as the cooldown of Auto Shot?<br>
<br>
The general consensus for the easiest way to handle varying haste buffs is to calculate an average DPS value for that level of haste as well as an Uptime percentage, and average it together with the non-hasted average DPS using the Uptime percentage?  We haven't stumbled upon a different model, correct?<br>
<br>
Effectively, I am trying to find the simplest way to calculate a shot rotation's length taking haste effects into account.  My plan is to find each shot's cast time/cooldown, to lay out a single,repeatable, rotation's worth of shots on a time-line, then find the average DPS using averaged shot damage and the duration of the repeatable rotation (and repeatable may or may not be long enough to handle a full rapid fire cooldown, depending on people's thoughts of the most efficient way to calculate the effects of temporary haste buffs).  In digging through Cheeky's spreadsheets it looks like he is laying out a full 50 shot rotation, which seems unnecessary to me, unless there is some reason to model instead of average.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I was just playing around with your spreadsheet and switching some of the pets to see the dps results. <br>
Is the Scorpids DPS really that high or is it incorrect/bugged? Here's a list with my results: (using .47 version)<br>
<br>
- Scorpid, trained max claw&amp;scorpid poison, added in sheet as primary: scorpid poison, secondary: claw, DPS: 74,11(!)<br>
- Cat, trained max claw&amp;bite, added in sheet as primary: bite, secondary: claw, DPS: 53,46<br>
- Ravager, trained max bite&amp;gore, added in sheet as primary: bite, secondary, gore, DPS: 58,73.<br>
<br>
This is all with "Happy" happiness.<br>
<br>
Edit: I also added a Wind Serpent for fun and thats even higher:<br>
- Wind Serpent, trained max bite&amp;LB, added in sheet as primary: bite, secondary: LB, DPS: 93,48(!!)<br>
<br>
I always thought Cats/Ravagers were the best DPS pets? (I have Humar right now)</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>Well, Cats and Ravager (and Raptors for that matter) are all the classical DPS pets. You can't go wrong with them.<br>
But there are circumstances where a Wind Serpent is advantagerous, and that is when your crit begins to grow to give it enough focus for LB (drop Bite). However, just because it looks like the Wind Serpent does more special damage doe not mean that is actually does more damage overall. Remember that the three earlier pets all have a 10% damage modifier while the Wind Serpent only has 7%. Those 3% are what is keeping the pack tight. But Wind Serpents should out-DPS the others with enough crits (and no special resistances on the boss).<br>
The Scorpid however needs a million AP from the Hunter to become really competitive, the reason is that it needs Scorpid Poison to tick for the most possible to make up for it's negative DPS modifier (-6%). I still haven't seen any Scorpid making up for it.<br>
<br>
Now that that is settled, I actually have some things for the spreadsheet, this is all considering a Wind Serpent.<br>
<br>
Why aren't there any pet buffs for Wrath of Air totem and Totem of Wrath. Both totems would benefit a Wind Serpent, and as far as I can tell when I have had it happen, it actually does benefit. Wrath of Air adds almost 50% again as much spelldam as the Wind Serpent normally has from our AP. Totem of Wrath I don't know, but it certainly looks like I see more LB crits.<br>
We can't always get into that awesome melee group for some nice Enhancement totems, sometimes some of us are raid gypsies, put whereever we do some good. And that often includes a Resto or Elemental Shaman that would rather buff the other three casters than the single Hunter (no argument there).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>My two cents on the matter is that group based % damage buffs are useful to have in if you're using the spreadsheet to evaluate different group compositions instead of just trying to compare gear. Questions like "do I do better in a shaman + ret pally + warrior + rogue group using 1:1 but with 3% damage and UR, or do I do better in a shadowpriest + warlocks group, getting no buffs but enough mana to do 3:2?". Or "would it be better to be in a 3 BM hunter + shaman group, or a 2 BM hunter, feral druid + shaman group?" Yes, it's trivial to calculate the former without the 3% damage and then manually tack it on, but having it available as a buff is convenient too <!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_718035"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Hi there first time poster long time reader, but anyways I was wondering if anyone is having anytime of problem modeling the Sunfury Bow compared to better ranged. Not sure what is happening  or heck it could be right but No matter what shot rotation, bow, anything I put in, the spread sheet is putting the Sunfury ahead in DPS. Ahead of the steam pistol,Striker, you name it thinks the Sunfury is God. Ive looked and looked at my talents,armor, buffs and all seem to be dead on....all but my ranged. Any info on what im messing up or just being an idiot on would be great. <br>

</div>hi cheeky, i think i might be misunderstanding something but if you value gear based on 0 hit rating, a ring with plus hit would rank higher then a ring without hit rating on it even if it has less agility/AP. wouldn't it be better to set the hit value actually above the hit cap so that +hit on gear isn't taken into account?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I cannot verify your results.<br>
<br>
Using my gear and some buffs as baseline:<br>
In <b>1)</b> (<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32505" target="_blank">[Madness of the Betrayer]</a> equipped as one of my trinkets -- trinket slot 1), I have a listed DPS of 2258.02.<br>
In <b>4)</b> (setting trinket slot to 'None', and adding 84 AP and 20 Hit Rating in the 'Hand Adjust' fields), I have a listed DPS of 2238.25. Comparing this to <b>1)</b>, I've seen a DPS loss. If the the Armor Penetration proc was not in some way added to my listed DPS, this would not have been the case.<br>
In <b>5)</b> (adding 170 Armor Penetration in the 'Hand Adjust' fields), I have a listed DPS of 2258.31. Comparing this to <b>1)</b>, my listed DPS is basically identical, with the small discrepancy most likely caused by not accurate enough +Armor Penetration value added in the 'Hand Adjust' field.<br>
<br>
I also tested to see whether or not the trinket slot had anything to do with the reported issue. Swapping my trinkets around (so <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32505" target="_blank">[Madness of the Betrayer]</a> was in trinket slot 2), my listed DPS was identical in <b>1)</b>, <b>4)</b> and <b>5)</b>.<br>

		<div id="post_message_727635"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Hey Cheeky,<br>
<br>
Thanks again for all your hard work!<br>
<br>
Regarding item comparisons, how about an option that takes into account swapping food buffs?  One of the comparisons I constantly do with your spreadsheet is to see if it's good value to drop a +hit item and use +20 hit food instead of +20 agi food.<br>
<br>
One example of this is dropping ye olde <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28649" target="_blank">[Garona's Signet Ring]</a> for <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=34887" target="_blank">[Angelista's Revenge]</a>, and swapping to +hit food gives me about an 11dps increase.<br>
<br>
So the suggestion is as follows:<br>
<br>
Add an option (in addition to the 2 you have) that allows a conversion of any +hit on the gear into +agi as a 1:1, and let people figure out where they are making the tradeoff (gems / item swaps etc).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_727794"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Hmm Cheeky, the ring dps list you posted just seems to be wrong. As said earlier compared with your spreadsheet hard khorium and certainly hyjal exalted ring give less dps then badge/za/twin ring. Why would the hyjal exalted ring be higher? I dont know, but you might have left out the 45 second inner cooldown and for the hard khorium ring to have more dps by that big of a margin looks silly.<br>
<br>
Things that would be nice to be added would be Fericous Inspiration by other BM hunters in the group and Blood Frenzy (warrior 4% more physical damage debuff) aswell as the weapon coating which I'm figuring is going to be out next version already. Though personally I really don't mind the FI/blood frenzy though since I can just do the math by myself.<br>

</div>I could do that, but I am assuming everyone has access to those areas. I did qualify location by Crafting, Quest, Honor, Arena, and Dungeon. I did not separate out BoP crafting from BoE crafting.<br>
<br>
I am going to only put 10 items in the list. To do more for all the different gear types makes the page unworkable. You can always turn off higher end content to eliminate items.<br>
<br>
The next release will only have the rings done. It's a lot of work to change an item class over, and I want to get more feedback before I jump in and spent 10 hours converting everything. Also, ranged weapons are not going to be supported for this. Weapon speed plays too much of a role in DPS, and can't be statically analyzed like other stats can.<br>

</div>Yeah, seems like the same mechanic that gave ferals the benefit affected us too. It's worth just above 20ap per stone if you have a 2.8 speed weapon and auto-shot-damage amounts to about 35% of your ap-gain. (12/0.2 * 0.35 = 21), so not really comparable to oils, but there are a bunch of plausible situations where you are not starved for mana.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_728085"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->As mentioned above, lootrank.com already allows putting in various weights for stats and will rank all items in wowhead; it also has a gems optimizer that maximizes the weight added by gems. lootrank doesn't work with item bonuses, nor items that are more complicated (i.e., dragonspine trophy.) Your spreadsheet works with bonuses and complicated items, but doesn't have a gems optimizer.<br>
<br>
I'd actually use the gems optimizer more than an item comparison feature, especially when switching items around in the spreadsheet looking for an ideal upgrade path. Right now, I have to constantly correct the gems.<br>
<br>
Regarding how to handle +hit, what I did in my separate item spreadsheet (done before lootrank) was list the dps gained both hit capped and not hit capped.<br>
<br>

<br>
New poster here expecting flames for posting in wrong section  spent a good couple of hours this morning "playing" with Cheeky's spreadsheet and am having problems loading it in Excel 2003.<br>
<br>
Once i've lowered security to get macros enabled, any time i hover over a button like Save profile, i get a macro debug screen with the error "Active X component can't create Object"<br>
<br>
Putting security back up to disable macros means i can no longer click the save profile button, they are hard, not clickable.<br>
<br>
I cant save the document at all, when i do i get the error "document not saved".<br>
<br>
All this means that i've no way of persisting my own information, and have to say im now frustrated out of using a great tool, that seems to work for everyone else - have googled this a lot and trawled hundreds of forum pages <br>
<br>
On another note when i initially open the document, excel shouts "File error: data may have been lost"<br>
<br>
Help!<br>

</div>Ok, now there is one thing i noticed while using a spamm "3:2" macro. I used it with the black bow for a long time and it worked fine, but now, with sw loots (lots of haste rating) and the new xbow you can easily get an autoshot speed of ~2 sec. So I asked myself if it wouldn't make sense to use a 1:1 castsequence makro if you fall below the 2 sec autoshot castingtime.<br>
The spreadsheet tells me to use a 3:2 (spamm), but an 1:1 castsequence would do only about 10 dps less for me.<br>
The 3:2 makro automatically turns into 1:1 if you have enough haste up, but there is a thin line where it seems to depend on your latency if a second steadyshot will be castet (at around 1.75 auto castspeed), that will clip your next auto shot. This is what I noticed.<br>
That's the reason why I thought about using a 1:1 castsequence, because with my current equip exactly this happens, if Iaoth proccs. Sometimes it casts a second steady which will more or less extremely clip the next auto shot, sometimes it doesn't.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>How about having a separate "slot" for 2-handed weapons? So you'd have "2-handed", "Main Hand", and "Off Hand". Whenever there's something in the "2-handed" slot, the other two's slots are filled like you do with meta gems. This would also make it easier to compare 2-handed weapons to dual-wielding as you wouldn't have to change your enchants and add/remove your offhand every time you want to switch.<br>
<br>
What exactly, though, is the nature of the problem that the large number of weapons is causing?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Hey Cheeky.. one thing I would like to see is a minimum level on the gear selection.  For instance.  What if on the Settings tab you enabled us to turn off certain items.<br>
<br>
Here are a few ways to hide some of the armor/weapons.<br>
<br>
Rarity<br>
iLevel<br>
Zone<br>
<br>
That way I could say I want to only see items that are Epic and above in my lists.. or only items with an iLevel &gt; 100 and the final one would be a little more complex...  I was thinking something like...<br>
<br>
Only include items in "these" zones. <br>
<br>
DropDownList would include Black Temple, Hyjal, Karazhan, Zul'Aman, World Epics, etc...  with the ability to select multiple zones.<br>
<br>
Because honestly, a lot of items are off limits to people based on raid progression.  Black Temple Sunwell guilds aren't doing Gruul's and Mag very often anymore.. and guilds in Kara may want to dream of Black Temple, Sunwell stuff but in reality most of the time they don't care.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Adding these into the sheet with the 4 decent random enchants (of Agility, of Power, of The Bandit and of The Monkey) might help some new 70's fill in a weak slot from the auction house.  There is also the lvl 68 Sundered and lvl 69 Talhide sets if you are looking for a decent list of the green mail.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

there is a strange thing i noticed: As soon as I put a red gem (10 agi) into the second socket of starstalker legguards instead of a shifting shadowsong amethyst, the total dps decreases, although the socket bonus was not achieved in both cases. I mean 10 agi &lt;&gt; 5 agi + 7 stam? Seems to be a bug? Or does HP influence DPS?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Well, your spreadsheet already lets us compare DPS while under a DST proc to DPS outside one. The PPM modelling changes in the latest version shouldn't affect that at all, it should only affect the total uptime of the proc - depending on how much uptime falls the trinket falls in ranking against other trinkets. This has been well known since you added the trinket to the sheet, and why we are able to change the PPM for the trinket on the settings screen IIRC. I don't think that's related to the gear ranking feature or the abacus ranking at all, is it? How do you rank Abacus without a separate screen to specify its shot rotation and uptime anyway?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>No, it's not really related. More of a pet peeve of mine. <br>
<br>
Because I don't want to add more shot rotations for every haste proc, what I do is the following for the Abacus:<br>
1 - Establish a haste cap. This is done by the CalcAttributes tab adding one more haste continuously until the DPS gain is only 0.1 or less from the previous value. The haste amount and total DPS gain are stored in an internal table.<br>
2 - The minimum value of 260 (<a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28288" target="_blank">[Abacus of Violent Odds]</a>) and the haste cap is then indexed into the table to determine DPS. This is then ratioed by the uptime of the proc (10/120).<br>
<br>
The haste lookup is actually used by all haste items. I think using this kind of model I might be able to determine the value of the haste meta gem as well, but I'm not sure if the whole thing is even valid.<br>
<br>
Oh, and the reason it looks so good is that I had the proc duration at 20 seconds, not 10.  Now it's a 30-32 DPS trinket, on the order of <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28034" target="_blank">[Hourglass of the Unraveller]</a> and the <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=35751" target="_blank">[Assassin's Alchemist Stone]</a>.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_743041"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Hm. I'm not sure I understood that Cheeky, but hopefully you leave the DST and Quick Shots tabs in place at least, since I think it's valuable being able to specify different rotations for our primary sources of haste.<br>
<br>
To get around the problem of needing to add a new tab for various different effects, would it not be possible to make a button that just creates a new sheet which lets you specify a shot rotation, just like the current quick shots tab, drawing base attack speed, ap and other stats from the rest of the spreadsheet, but having basically its own hand-adjust row in which we could enter say the haste from abacus or heroism, or the AP from the AP drums. This would let you know what your DPS is while under those conditions, and if you know the "uptime" of those conditions, you could specify somewhere else something like this:<br>
<br>
special sheet 1: 5%<br>
special sheet 2: 10%<br>
<br>
With the results tab doing the usual weighted average of the various DPS values.<br>
<br>
I know that wouldn't work accurately unless the user created a tab for every combination of various stackable procs, but it would be as accurate as the user wants to make it by his own effort, and be nicely extensible, and I think the only implementation headache for you would be making a macro to generate the template sheet efficiently (I imagine excel is often used for things like that that). The special sheets wouldn't need to link into your item DB at all, just your listing of current stats, and how much each attack hits for.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>It looks like the abacus is also 10 seconds of haste. Abacus can be triggered every 2 minutes, while the DST <b>can</b> proc more often than that, for more haste. The abacus does have 24 more static attack power, but you can pick that up elsewhere.<br>
<br>
I guess in the end, a big part of it may just be personal opinion.<br>

		<div id="post_message_743204"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Ok, I think this version is actually workable. <br>
<br>
- Corrected the proc duration of the Abacus of Violent Odds from 20 seconds to 10 seconds.<br>
- Fixed the DPS gains from the Darkmoon Card:Wrath and Darkmoon Card:Crusade.<br>
- Fixed cell permissions on DPS per attribute to allow for CalcAttributes to work again.<br>
- Corrected the lookup of on-use +AP procs. This should fix some errors with these trinkets.<br>
- Corrected the lookup of Multi-Shot damage bonus with PvP gloves. This was probably leading to N/A issues for Multi-Shot damage.<br>
- Fixed set bonuses for weapons, shoulders, and gloves.<br>

		<div id="post_message_743478"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->The idea of a overall haste cap isnt accurate, but different rotations do have thier own cap.  When I get into the realm of 1000+ haste, a 2:1 (auto, auto, steady) rotation gives much higher dps then the classic 1:1.  I don't see any way to track variable rotations without having multiple shot pages like there are for quick shots and DST.<br>
<br>
At the moment, I just calculate one rotation times X amount of time, and calculate it the other for for X amount of time and add them together.<br>
<br>
edit: Also its little, but could you add a 2:1 rotation button?<br>
<br>
edit 2: The ranking on the gear tab is very nice, but also makes it impossible to find things other than the very best<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_744464"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Are you sure that DST it that low in DPS since I can see a HUGE increase in DPS when it proccs, maybe because I go from a 3:2 to 1:1 rotation with my ammount of haste ATM.<br>
<br>
I also saw something weird in the Settings and Result tab that DST was modeled as a 1PPM trinket when during our last Illidan try my proccwatch registered it proccing at most 8seconds after the internal CD was done and more often then not ~1sec after the internal was over. Inputting DST at 2PPM makes it take the third place.<br>
<br>
I agree that this is HIGHLY situational and I trust that countless hours have been put in modeling this trinket but I can't help defending it since I can with my own eyes see a huge decrease in DPS when using Bersekers and Ashtounge on Gurtugg (~100dps less) then with my DST.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_744466"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Well ever since version 48 there been some strange stuff going on in the spreadsheet.<br>
Like with the gear planner tab.<br>
<br>
Showing you the updates that you can plan to purchase or get.<br>
<br>
But now it actually shows that <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=34891" target="_blank">[The Blade of Harbingers]</a> is the best <br>
hunter weapon in the game at the moment.<br>
When in version 47 it says its not. (*wen you run it in the gear tab*)<br>
<br>
But now for some strange reason the updates pointed out by the gear planner tab<br>
arrant correct accordingly to the gear tab.<br>
<br>
for example:<br>
on the gear planner tab it says : <br>
<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=34014" target="_blank">[Vengeful Gladiator's Waraxe]</a> &lt; <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33492" target="_blank">[Trollbane]</a><br>
but <br>
on the gear tab it says : <br>
<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=34014" target="_blank">[Vengeful Gladiator's Waraxe]</a> &gt; <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33492" target="_blank">[Trollbane]</a><br>
<br>
When i would switch those weapons it would cost my about 7 dps and 12.3 total dps loss.<br>
but still on the gear planner tab it says that <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33492" target="_blank">[Trollbane]</a><br>
is a very nice upgrade for me.<br>
<br>
Also since version 48 the spreadsheet seems to love haste over every other stat.<br>
Since all top 3 hunter items in the gear planner tab are haste related.<br>
But stacking up haste wont that pretty much just cap you or wouldn't you<br>
just hit the haste cap really fast.<br>
<br>
I don't actually know the haste cap of hunters myself. but i did follow experiment.<br>
<br>
In my haste gear i get the following.<br>
<br>
Haste : 139<br>
auto : 1.9<br>
ss: 1.0<br>
<br>
In my normal raiding gear i get <br>
<br>
haste : 77<br>
auto : 1.9<br>
ss: 1.0<br>
<br>
The only difference between the 2 is when IAH procs <br>
in haste gear i get a 1.6 auto<br>
and in normal raiding gear a 1.7 auto<br>
<br>
So i don't think that the haste calculations or the interpretation of haste is correctly in the spreadsheet.<br>
Claiming every item with haste is beter then normal items.<br>
<br>
whit version 47 i rund every item of mount hyal threw the spreadsheet to see what was a upgrade and what not.<br>
showing that <br>
<br>
<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30919" target="_blank">[Valestalker Girdle]</a> &lt; <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30046" target="_blank">[Belt of the Black Eagle]</a><br>
and now all of a suden its .<br>
<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30919" target="_blank">[Valestalker Girdle]</a> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30046" target="_blank">[Belt of the Black Eagle]</a><br>
then i go like ????<br>
<br>
i know you work on the spreadsheet to update it and get the calculations as correct as possible<br>
but where you guys so far off then with the haste calculation in version 47 ?<br>
<br>
Also ever since i began to use version 48 loading and saving stuff takes ages <br>
whit office 2007 professional.<br>
What i don't have whit version 47 and below they save and load very smood.<br>
<br>
But at far most i have to say the spreadsheet has helpt me alot nice work and keep up the good work <!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_744601"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I've also noticed the contradictions between the gear and custom gear sheets. I think it may have something to do with how haste is treated in the gear sheet. In ver 47 if you start stacking haste you see some nice improvements in dps but with ver 49 you get only small change for haste. <br>
<br>
eg Vengeful Gladiator's Rifle (speed of 3.0) which can stack haste up the wazoo and not start to hurt, only increases by 0.63 dps per 10 haste in ver 49 whereas it would increase by approx 4 dps per 10 haste in version 47<br>
<br>

BTW, is there an explanation for the Treat + hit as variable on the Gear Planner sheet coz I am mystified by the selections<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_744943"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Because of the way different stats interact with each other, the gear planner will never be 100% accurate. But I don't think it's so far off as to be useless, either.<br>
<br>
Just testing it out, I would switch an item to "None", CalcAttributes, and then see how the theoretical numbers in the Gear Planner matched the spreadsheet output when I selected the item:<br>
<br>
With no neck item I was at 2029.84 DPS<br>
<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28509" target="_blank">[Worgen Claw Necklace]</a> : Gear Planner - 42.87 DPS, Plugging in item - 43.13 DPS.<br>
<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=34679" target="_blank">[Shattered Sun Pendant of Might]</a> : Gear Planner - 43.17 DPS, Plugging in item - 43.29<br>
<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32260" target="_blank">[Choker of Endless Nightmares]</a> : Gear Planner - 57.55, Plugging in the item - 54.24<br>
<br>
For the Choker, it took me 4 over the hit cap, wasting about 3.6 DPS of item budget.<br>
<br>
Now, none of those items had any haste. Haste, as you add it, makes every other stat more valuable. It's hard to quantify that before seeing the numbers. Here is the same experiment using the chest slot:<br>
<br>
With no chest I was at 1972.84 DPS<br>
<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=34373" target="_blank">[Embrace of the Phoenix]</a> : Planner - 126.88, Plugged in - 129.9<br>
<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=34912" target="_blank">[Scaled Drakeskin Chestguard]</a> : Planner - 98.39, Plugged in - 100.13<br>
<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30139" target="_blank">[Rift Stalker Hauberk]</a> : Planner - 90.26, Plugged in - 68.98<br>
<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=34369" target="_blank">[Carapace of Sun and Shadow]</a> : Planner - 153.62, Plugged in - 129.38<br>
<br>
Both the T5 chest and the Carapace put me way over the hit cap, again wasting item budget.<br>
<br>
I guess I can try and figure out a way to factor the hit cap into the equations, but I'm not sure how much of an effort I want to put in making the Gear Planner super-accurate.

The items in drop down lists (except weapons) are sorted backed on how you pick things in the Gear Planner to be sorted. This was a much-requested feature. You can always put them back in alphabetical order just like they were previously.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_745022"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I wouldn't worry much about the gear planner's accuracy - it gives a quick and dirty estimate of items, you can put them into the sheet and figure out actual value yourself - maybe add a hard to miss disclaimer that stats like haste/hit/ArP are not necessarily estimated very well.<br>
<br>
Personally I don't plan to use the planner much, since plugging in various combinations of items to see which setup maximizes DPS is not something I expect the planner to do for me (incidentally though, a warlock in the warlock thread here actually wrote a genetic algorithm to do just that, trying a few million different combinations of gear to fix the maximal setup ).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
My collected information so far:<br>
I use Microsoft Excel 2007 on Windows XP SP2.<br>
It first occured in v47 of the spreadsheet and is still there in v49.<br>
It seems to be related to one of these two items:<br>
<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=34570" target="_blank">[Gronnstalker's Boots]</a> and <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=34194" target="_blank">[Mantle of the Golden Forest]</a><br>
The error occurs right after parsing the Mantle of the Golden Forest loaded from the Armory and seems not to occur if I don't wear these items.<br>

		<div id="post_message_745226"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I have a hard time believing that DST ranks below Bloodlust Brooch on the Gear Planner tab when it shows as a DPS upgrade on the Gear tab.  Personal experience again tells me that DST should still rank higher than many of those trinkets.<br>
<br>
Also, Angelista's Revenge shows as a DPS upgrade on the Gear tab but on the Gear Planner tab it ranks low.  Switching to Deceitful Intent and even though I am only at 135 HR, it shows as a DPS downgrade on the Gear tab but a huge DPS upgrade on the Gear Planner tab.  If I max out my hit by swapping in a neck with HR, Angelista's &gt; Deceitful Intent on the Gear tab but Deceitful Intent &gt; Angelista's on the Gear Planner tab.<br>

I also saw something weird in the Settings and Result tab that DST was modeled as a 1PPM trinket when during our last Illidan try my proccwatch registered it proccing at most 8seconds after the internal CD was done and more often then not ~1sec after the internal was over. blah blah blah....</div>

</div>Sorry was a bit tired when I wrote this but now as I was parcing my proccwatch after tonights BT run using ashtounge I ran into my raid from yesterday witch I previosly wrote about - and it suprisingly showed that the DST procced directly AFTER the buff had ran out. I have no idea how this happened but I belive it was during heroism. Could heroism bugg the internal of trinkets? Or did it bug my proccwatch.

		<div id="post_message_745743"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->OK, I think I have gotten to the bottom of why I was getting such small gains with haste between version 47 and 49. It seems to be related to the latency field from the Shot Rotation tab. Putting a high latency has a dramtic affect upon the effect of haste. <br>
<br>
For example, using Vengeful Gladiator's Rifle (3.0 speed) and making adjustmemnts to the "blue field" haste figures on the Gear sheet has the following results:<br>
<br>
0.2 latency with +10 haste yields 5.50 dps gain<br>
0.5 latency with +10 haste yields 3.00 dps gain<br>
1.0 latency with +10 haste yields 0.08 dps gain<br>
<br>
The latency field also has a severe impact upon the dps figures that are normally achieved.<br>
<br>
1. Is this an accurate modelling of the effects of latency and haste? I would have thought low latency just affected the timing of shots not how the haste values scale. <br>
<br>
2. Given the changes to client/server side made in 2.3, does latency really have that great an impact these days?<br>
<br>
3. Does low latency really mean that haste gear is a waste? <br>
<br>
Cheers<br>

</div>I'm trying to determine what trinkets are the best for me to use.  I have Berserker's Call, Dragonspine Trophy, and the Shadowsong Panther.  Using my common raid buffs (BoM, BoK, Food and Flask) I find the Berserker's call and Shadowsong Panther are the best for me right now.  Does this sound correct?  Here is my armory if that helps:<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080517144926/http://www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Perenolde&amp;n=Runningelk" target="_blank">Runningelk-Perenolde</a><br>
<br>
This gets me to my second question on the use of the spreadsheet.  For trinkets with a "USE" how do I ensure that "USE" is being calculated properly.

				<div style="font-style:italic">OK, I think I have gotten to the bottom of why I was getting such small gains with haste between version 47 and 49. It seems to be related to the latency field from the Shot Rotation tab. Putting a high latency has a dramtic affect upon the effect of haste. <br>
<br>
For example, using Vengeful Gladiator's Rifle (3.0 speed) and making adjustmemnts to the "blue field" haste figures on the Gear sheet has the following results:<br>
<br>
0.2 latency with +10 haste yields 5.50 dps gain<br>
0.5 latency with +10 haste yields 3.00 dps gain<br>
1.0 latency with +10 haste yields 0.08 dps gain<br>
<br>
The latency field also has a severe impact upon the dps figures that are normally achieved.<br>
<br>
1. Is this an accurate modelling of the effects of latency and haste? I would have thought low latency just affected the timing of shots not how the haste values scale. <br>
<br>
2. Given the changes to client/server side made in 2.3, does latency really have that great an impact these days?<br>
<br>
3. Does low latency really mean that haste gear is a waste? <br>
<br>
Cheers<br>

</div>Latency can have a very bad effect, especially on /castsequence macros. If you use the 3:2 macro, or hand-time (compensating for latency) put in your reaction speed rather than latency in that location. It should be more accurate in what you see in game.<br>

</div>It actually goes until the value of 1 more haste is less than 0.1 DPS. I then call that value your haste cap. It builds a look up table of haste-&gt;DPS. If you ever looked at the table (you can't, I hide it) you can clearly see the cut-off where Quick Shots no longer benefits from haste. It works pretty well for estimating haste DPS.<br>

I really like the gear planner, kudos for putting that together.  However, I seem to be getting some odd results.<br>
<br>
I recently picked up Shadow-walker's Cord out of BT.  I am currently wearing Belt of the Black Eagle.  According to the gear planner, under the "based on current +hit" setting, the BT drop should be a fairly substantial increases over my crafted belt.  The Shadow-walker's is listed as 76.07 vs the Black Eagle at 52.05.  However, when I actually put those items into the gear tab, my overall dps drops by roughly 6 dps.<br>
<br>
Do you know of anything I might be doing wrong to cause this?  Also, I did go back to the Shot Rotation and Quick Shots tab to make sure I refreshed the rotations since there's haste on the Shadow-walker's.<br>

		<div id="post_message_750490"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->The gear planning function is very good - a welcome addition so thanks indeed.<br>
<br>
One thing to note (and something I am sure can be added, though it would be a massive amount of work!) is that the model itself assumes either 0 Hit or your current +Hit.  What it does not do is account for the amount of +Hit on said item already which is skewing the output values. <br>
<br>
For example:<br>
<br>
<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32323" target="_blank">[Shadowmoon Destroyer's Drape]</a> - 52.88 @ 0 Hit  / 36.44 @ 100% (current equipped) Hit.  <br>
<br>
This may lead people to over-value certain items if they religiously follow the spreadsheet (as I suspect a good number of Hunters do).<br>
<br>
The way around this I have been using since before the Gear Upgrades tab is to value the item before and after the upgrade then use the value in between to guage it's upgrade worth.  <br>
<br>
Keep up the good work Cheeky.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

With 2% or 1% (and even 0,5%, like posted above) *away* from the hit cap it is still by far the most DPS per point here.<br>
And everything with some hit rating, like Worgen Claw Necklace.. is getting into the top choices over Telonicus' Pendant / SO neck. (just as example)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
- yep, disabling leather would be cool<br>
- pressing "save profile" or "CalcAttributes" (which is quite necessary now) and waiting 3 minutes is somewhat annoying. if could be a way to work around it, please implement that.<br>

		<div id="post_message_752989"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I'm feeling "dazed &amp; confused" here ... always took the spreadsheet as very solid reference to the theoretical maximum DPS I can achieve. I do understand that we're talking about ideal numbers in ideal situation.<br>
<br>
My dilemma is caused by the following setup: 4T6 pieces, <a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=34183" target="_blank">Shivering Felspine</a> + <a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33590" target="_blank">Cloak of Fiends</a> + <a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30906" target="_blank">Bristleblitz Striker</a> + 80haste from drums + SV spec. I will not go through the details of the other gear pieces, since they are irrelevant (all BT quality gear, no other +haste).<br>
<br>
Whenever I use the 7/20/34 spec in the spreadsheet I get about 100 DPS less then by using 0/28/33.  All the evidence from the SV thread points that 7/20/34 with the gear mentioned above is the best combination possible, if using a 3:2 shot rotation, and will be net superior to any classic SV build with the 1:1.5 shot rotation. However, I can't see that reflected in the numbers I get from the spreadsheet.<br>

</div>So I just read the patch notes one more time to find what i missed. The only note i saw on sorting was in the notes for version 47<br>
<br>
"<i> - Begun adding a gear planner feature, sorting items by DPS and availability. Haste and procs may be a little screwy. Melee weapons are broken down into one-handed and two-handed categories. Ranged weapons are not supported."</i><br>
<br>
While it mentions that the gear planner tab sorts items by DPS &amp; availability, the note doesn't say anything about the sorting in the DPS Planner effecting the drop downs in the Gear Tab.<br>
<br>
Also once I did what you said of clicking the button to sort alphabetically on the DPS Planning tab, the drop downs for the Main Hand &amp; Off hand slots did not resort. Every other drop down sorted the items properly.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Trying his gear in Cheeky's show only a 4 dps gain from 0/28/33 over 7/20/34, but you also loose thrill of the hunt. <br>
<br>
After talking with our survival hunter he explains that because of all the haste effect he is almost always doing 3:2 and not 2:1.  Additionally he says it is more dps to only use steady, and arcane and multi only in special cases.  The difference is even greater when you stop using multi and arcane.<br>

		<div id="post_message_754315"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Great work on the gear planning tab. I know it was a lot of work and that it is still in development.<br>
<br>
I would like to add a nice to have request to the gear planner if you ever have the time and inclincation. I understand if you do not though.<br>
<br>
At least for many survival hunters, personal DPS gain from an item is not the only discriminating factor. The other main factor is how the item affects our DPS contribution to the rest of the raid via changes to our average EW AP. It would be ideal if next to the DPS listing if there was also an EW DPS listing. It would take the average EW AP contribution from the item (change in average EW AP between equipping the item and having nothing equipped in that slot) and multiplied by the AP to DPS conversion and the number of other physical DPS in the raid (both of the latter items would be inputs on the Settings and Results tab). Of course, this extra reporting column would disappear or be blank for hunters without any ranks in EW. <br>
<br>
Then additional nice features would be to be able to sort the gear not only personal DPS (the current option) but also on EW DPS (for those who desire to maximize that) and total raid DPS (the sum of the previous 2) for those, like myself, who try to maximize that.<br>
<br>
This would allow survival hunters to be able to better make use of the hard work you put into the gear planning tab. Currently, items listed high on the gear planning tab, while better options for BM or MM hunters, may not be the best option for me since they have no or little agility possibly resulting in a loss of total raid DPS by equipping the item.<br>
<br>
Another question on the gear planning tab. Are the comparisons done with populating the sockets with the default gem for that socket color listed on Settings and Results tab? It would make sense if that was the case since how would you know that we would prefer to socket it differently. If that's the case and we are usually someone who prefers all agility gems over others, I guess that we could make those our defaults for all 3 colors. However, this brings up the question of how the gear planning feature accounts for meta gems and making sure that meta gem requirements are met.<br>
<br>
Could you please provide some insight into that and any other assumptions that go into the gear planning results so that we can better understand the results that we are seeing.<br>
<br>
Thanks for your hard work.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
Comparing [Madness of the Betrayer] on the Gear Planner Tab with setting as 0 hit and as current hit (which would be cap) it reports the same dps value for both settings. I think the hit is not factored in correctly for this item. I tried to see if it is for trinkets in general, but the only other trinket that i could remember having hit was the Poison Vial, and it doesn't get listed even with karazhan only items.<br>

What I also did was removing the added hit rating and the value did not change either with either setting for hit evaluation.<br>

		<div id="post_message_754546"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Thank you for the work of another update of the spreadsheet.<br>
<br>
I found something strange with the latency issue with the "Drapongspine Trophy" Page. I was testing a setup with the badge crossbow with no haste rating gear. I inputed 0.2 seconds in the latency cell and used 1:1 (Steady) Rotation in the "Shot Rotation", "Quick Shots" and "Dragonspine Trophy" pages.<br>
<br>
When the "Macro?" cell is set to "Castsequence" in the "Shot Rotation" page, all four shot rotations in the above three pages will be getting 0.2 seconds gap between the Autos and Steadies due to the mechanism of Castsequence. I think that this is working as intended.<br>
<br>
But when the "Macro?" cell is set to "Hand-Weaved" or "Spam", the 0.2 second gaps between the Autos and Steadies disppear from the "Shot Rotation" and "Quick Shots" page. But the 0.2 second gaps still exist on the "Draponspine Trophy" page. Is this working as intended that the shot rotation under dragonspine trophy effect is not consistent with the other two under "Hand-Weaved" and "Spam"?<br>
<br>
The cells of O column in "Shot Rotation" page and the cells of J column in "Quick Shots" page are using the variable "CastLag" in their formulas. But the cells of K and R column in "Dragonspine Trophy" page are using the variable "Lag" in their formulas. Is this the reason of the inconsistent between those pages?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

1. <a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?talent=cZVxrRV0hhZcG0bpcrhV0h" target="_blank">0/28/33</a><br>
<br>
1:1.5 Shot Rotation (with multi &amp; arcane): <b>1997.60 DPS</b><br>
3:2 Shot Rotation: <b>1897.19 DPS</b><br>
<br>
2. <a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?talent=cxbZVxbRVZcG0bpcrhVoh" target="_blank">7/20/34</a><br>
<br>
1:1.5 Shot Rotation (with multi &amp; arcane): <b>1955 DPS</b><br>
3:2 Shot Rotation: <b>1906 DPS</b><br>
<br>
So, from these results, I should take the 0/28/33 spec, since it gives me the best DPS, which certainly contradicts all the "live" reports. Moreover, in both cases, the 1:1.5 shot rotation gives better results than 3:2.<br>
Please note that I am fully aware that the gear showed up above is not the best in its slot or even the gems combination can be adjusted for better results. I'm just trying to replicate the case of 4T6, 80 passive haste + drums + 3:2 shot rotation.<br>
<br>
Is there any explanation for this difference?<br>
<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Great work on the gear planning tab. I know it was a lot of work and that it is still in development.<br>
<br>
I would like to add a nice to have request to the gear planner if you ever have the time and inclincation. I understand if you do not though.<br>
<br>
At least for many survival hunters, personal DPS gain from an item is not the only discriminating factor. The other main factor is how the item affects our DPS contribution to the rest of the raid via changes to our average EW AP. It would be ideal if next to the DPS listing if there was also an EW DPS listing. It would take the average EW AP contribution from the item (change in average EW AP between equipping the item and having nothing equipped in that slot) and multiplied by the AP to DPS conversion and the number of other physical DPS in the raid (both of the latter items would be inputs on the Settings and Results tab). Of course, this extra reporting column would disappear or be blank for hunters without any ranks in EW. <br>
<br>
Then additional nice features would be to be able to sort the gear not only personal DPS (the current option) but also on EW DPS (for those who desire to maximize that) and total raid DPS (the sum of the previous 2) for those, like myself, who try to maximize that.<br>
<br>
This would allow survival hunters to be able to better make use of the hard work you put into the gear planning tab. Currently, items listed high on the gear planning tab, while better options for BM or MM hunters, may not be the best option for me since they have no or little agility possibly resulting in a loss of total raid DPS by equipping the item.<br>
<br>
Another question on the gear planning tab. Are the comparisons done with populating the sockets with the default gem for that socket color listed on Settings and Results tab? It would make sense if that was the case since how would you know that we would prefer to socket it differently. If that's the case and we are usually someone who prefers all agility gems over others, I guess that we could make those our defaults for all 3 colors. However, this brings up the question of how the gear planning feature accounts for meta gems and making sure that meta gem requirements are met.<br>
<br>
Could you please provide some insight into that and any other assumptions that go into the gear planning results so that we can better understand the results that we are seeing.<br>
<br>
Thanks for your hard work.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>I'll look into the effort for EW estimates. I use the default colors, and if all colors match for that item you get the socket bonus calculated in too. I make no checks on the Meta gem. It assumes it works.<br>

<br>
Comparing [Madness of the Betrayer] on the Gear Planner Tab with setting as 0 hit and as current hit (which would be cap) it reports the same dps value for both settings. I think the hit is not factored in correctly for this item. I tried to see if it is for trinkets in general, but the only other trinket that i could remember having hit was the Poison Vial, and it doesn't get listed even with karazhan only items.<br>
<br>
What I also did was removing the added hit rating and the value did not change either with either setting for hit evaluation.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Thank you for the work of another update of the spreadsheet.<br>
<br>
I found something strange with the latency issue with the "Drapongspine Trophy" Page. I was testing a setup with the badge crossbow with no haste rating gear. I inputed 0.2 seconds in the latency cell and used 1:1 (Steady) Rotation in the "Shot Rotation", "Quick Shots" and "Dragonspine Trophy" pages.<br>
<br>
When the "Macro?" cell is set to "Castsequence" in the "Shot Rotation" page, all four shot rotations in the above three pages will be getting 0.2 seconds gap between the Autos and Steadies due to the mechanism of Castsequence. I think that this is working as intended.<br>
<br>
But when the "Macro?" cell is set to "Hand-Weaved" or "Spam", the 0.2 second gaps between the Autos and Steadies disppear from the "Shot Rotation" and "Quick Shots" page. But the 0.2 second gaps still exist on the "Draponspine Trophy" page. Is this working as intended that the shot rotation under dragonspine trophy effect is not consistent with the other two under "Hand-Weaved" and "Spam"?<br>
<br>
The cells of O column in "Shot Rotation" page and the cells of J column in "Quick Shots" page are using the variable "CastLag" in their formulas. But the cells of K and R column in "Dragonspine Trophy" page are using the variable "Lag" in their formulas. Is this the reason of the inconsistent between those pages?</div>

CPU usage goes to 100% (luckily I have 2 so I can keep working). Obviously, the sheet is going into a loop somewhere, although I'm not sure why (since noone else has reported it yet).<br>
<br>
EDIT: It did finish after about 5 minutes of heavy churning, so it's just very very slow on my computer I guess (I have dual Athlon MP 2800+ system).</div>

</div>CalcAttributes is now very computationally intensive, since I need to establish a haste-&gt;DPS mapping (it is non-linear) to be accurate on estimations for the Gear Planner. It doesn't do the haste table for normal item updates, just on the button. I really have no clue why Save Profile got slow, I hadn't changed it at all, and stepping through it manually didn't show anything out of the ordinary. It annoys the fuck out of me too. <br>

So if the item being replaced in the Gear Planner analysis has sockets that are currently used to meet the meta gem requirements and the item replacing it does not meet those requirements (either it does not have enough sockets to count towards the requirements or the default gem placement into those sockets do not meet the meta requirements), then the meta gem bonus is not factored into the comparison analysis?

		<div id="post_message_757507"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Currently, a BM using a 3:2 rotation will see only a low benefit of haste. (In my example, 1 haste ~ 0.5 dps).<br>
<br>
I understand haste in combination with a 3:2 rotation this way:<br>
Additional haste decreses the chance, that the rotation drops to a 2:1 rotation.<br>
<br>
IE, with 0 haste you have to click 50 ms after the gcd ends, to give your auto shot enough time to be cast.<br>
You click ten times per second, thus your SpamSpeed ist 100ms.<br>
In this case, the uptime of your 3:2 rotation is 50%, because there is a chance of 50%, that you'll click 50ms or more after the GCD ends.<br>
<br>
Now, with +1% haste, your auto shot shoots faster and thus only 45 ms after the gcd ends are needed for your auto shot to be cast first. Your uptime will then be 55%.<br>
<br>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080529224736im_/http://elitistjerks.com/cgi-bin/mathtex.cgi?Uptime=\frac{1-min. SpamSpeed}{SpamSpeed}" alt="Uptime=\frac{1-min. SpamSpeed}{SpamSpeed}"><br>
<br>
where<br>
<br>
min. SpamSpeed = Time needed, so that the auto shot comes first <i>(In the cases above 50/45ms)</i><br>
SpamSpeed = 1 / Clicks per Second <i>(100ms)</i><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The dps difference beetwen a 3:2 and a 2:1 rotation is very high, but you need only 85 haste (assuming a 2.8 weapon) to get a relyable 3:2 rotation instead of a 2:1.<br>
I'm quite sure that haste is the best stat (maybe even better than hit) for hunters with a 3:2 rotation (As long as they don't reach the hastecap). Many hunters will believe your Spreadsheet without thinking about this complex problem. So I would suggest to add a little comment about haste in combination with a 3:2 rotation.<br>
I'm currently working on a way to calcuate the real worth of haste, I'll post it here when it's ready.<br>
<br>
<br>
A little example for now:<br>
Dps with 3:2 rotation: 2117<br>
Dps with 2:1 rotation: 2027<br>
<i>(both calculated by the spreadsheet for my equip [2 pieces of t6])</i><br>
<br>
Needed haste to go from a 2:1 rotation to a 3:2 with a 2.8 weapon: 85<br>
<i>(calculated by the program I posted a few pages back)</i><br>
<br>
<b>Dps per Haste:<br>
(2117-2027) / 85 = 1,06</b><br>
<i>(This is even better than my dps gain out of Hit: 0.97)</i><br>

</div>There is no internal cooldown in the model. Your anecdotal evidence is just that, anecdotal. There are probably lots of times you've gone over 1 minute without a proc, but you don't remember those. Also, it can proc over itself, wiping out some of your potential time with the buff.<br>
<br>
If you can find a flaw in the model (or discover the proc rate is different than 1.0) I'd be more than happy to adjust it.<br>

I have read some posts that seem to imply that this enchant does work for hunters, is that correct?  Forgive me if I'm asking this question for the umpteen millionth time.  I did some google searches on elitistjerks.com and couldn't find any posts relating to this.  If it does work do you know approximately how much damage it's worth on Demon bosses?  <br>
<br>
Thanks in advance for any insight you can give.<br>

Demonslaying enchant has nothing to do with hunters (unless you are one of those melee hunters). The change in last patch made Elixir of Demonslaying working for ranged AP as well, ie. it's the best battle elixir/flask you can use for example on Brutallus.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_759105"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Sharpening stones are easily tested with a fine light crossbow (a weapon with no damage range) on Dr. Boom. You can see that auto shot damage goes up by 12 when fel or adamantite sharpening stones are applied to your melee weapon.<br>
<br>
As for the value of it, 12 damage per shot is equivalent to 12*14/(weapon speed) AP, but only for Auto and Multi. If you use a 3.0 weapon and Auto and Multi make up roughly half of your shots, then a sharpening stone is approximately worth 28 AP.<br>
<br>
The righteous weapon coating is 300 AP for 10s, with a proc interval that's pretty predictably 40-50s, so it's worth an average of 60-75 AP. However, applying 2 of them doesn't do much because they're on the same internal cooldown.<br>
<br>
So RWC + Fel sharp is the best combo of temporary enchants, by a substantial margin.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I would suggest taking the value you get for drums (we'll call this Wd) and the value you get for no drums (we'll call this Nd) then just do the following calculation:<br>
<br>
((3*Nd)+(Wd))/4<br>
<br>
For your example where it's given you a 35 dps increase, you would see a net total, including drum downtime, of 8.75 dps increase. It's not atall a perfect model but it's simple and a good enough approximation for you to use.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Sharpening stones are easily tested with a fine light crossbow (a weapon with no damage range) on Dr. Boom. You can see that auto shot damage goes up by 12 when fel or adamantite sharpening stones are applied to your melee weapon.<br>
<br>
As for the value of it, 12 damage per shot is equivalent to 12*14/(weapon speed) AP, but only for Auto and Multi. If you use a 3.0 weapon and Auto and Multi make up roughly half of your shots, then a sharpening stone is approximately worth 28 AP.<br>
<br>
The righteous weapon coating is 300 AP for 10s, with a proc interval that's pretty predictably 40-50s, so it's worth an average of 60-75 AP. However, applying 2 of them doesn't do much because they're on the same internal cooldown.<br>
<br>
So RWC + Fel sharp is the best combo of temporary enchants, by a substantial margin.</div>

It does make sense though, since the tooltip only mentions adding critical strike rating, not melee critical strike rating like the other stones. The +dmg doesn't apply to ranged, and that's the only part of the stone that applies to "blunt" weapons.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>
