<br>
<b>Version 0.10.4, 7/24/08</b>: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080730131101/http://www.savefile.com/files/1686925" target="_blank">Download</a><br>
<br>
<b>FAQ</b><br>
<br>
<i>Q: When will this item/buff/effect/feature/whatever be added to the sheet?</i><br>
A: I don't know, so don't even bother asking.  It may surprise you to learn that I don't get paid to support this, and as such things like "my job" take precedence (as do things like "raiding"). Thus, there is no regular schedule for updates or when things get done.  I will add them when I have time, and no amount of asking will change when that happens.  Though it might annoy me.<br>
<br>
That said: it's fine to point out an item that's recently been added to the game; however, if you're going to do so, *please* read over the last couple of pages and make sure it hasn't been noted already.  People in this forum are remarkably on top of these things, so if you come by a week after the item was added and mention that it's not on the sheet, I can guarantee you that it's already been mentioned.<br>
<br>
<i>Q: I have a comment/question/concern to express to you, what's the best way of doing so?</i><br>
A: If it's of broader interest to the community, this thread is fine.  If it's something pretty specific, I recommend PM.  If it's something that can't be handled in either of these formats, you can try to find me in game, but the amount of hours a week that I'm logged on and not actively engaged in some activity is pretty small, and I'm not about to interrupt a BT raid to talk to you.  So you'll generally have better luck - and get better answers - corresponding via the forums than you will in-game.<br>
<br>
<i>Q: Why is the socket bonus for item X not working?</i><br>
A: It is working.  This is a common misconception/point of confusion.  Column F on the front page does not speak to whether the set bonus *is* active; rather, it refers to whether you *should* be using the socket bonus.  Note that this recommendation does not include metagem activation, so take its recommendations with a grain of salt.<br>
<i><br>
Q: The "recommended cycle" is showing 3.3s/5r (or something like that), how the heck do I do a 3.3 point slice and dice?</i><br>
A: You don't.  For smoothness-of-modeling reasons, this sheet uses continuously defined cycles.  In practice, of course, you can't do a 3.3 point SnD.  However, you can weave 3 and 4 point SnDs if you're good (although the mechanics of this is tricky).  If you want to be lazy about this, just use the next larger SnD (4-point, in this case) or the next smaller rupture (i.e., 1s3.5r becomes 1s3r).  If you want to be fancy, go ahead and weave.<br>
<br>
<i>Q: Speaking of 1s3.5r - I'm a dagger rogue with 2/5 T4, and the sheet is recommending a 1s3.Xr cycle.  OMGWTFBBQ?</i><br>
A: For a full discussion of this I recommend taking a peek at post 532, but the short answer is: using a longer SnD doesn't actually let you use a larger rupture; the extra energy you regenerate during the extra SnD uptime is almost identical to the amount of energy required to launch the extra backstab and get the extra combo point.  Hence, if you can support 5s3r, you can most likely support 1s3r, which gives you almost double the rupture damage in exchange for a slight loss in number of backstabs, and, in practice, this tends to be a worthwhile tradeoff.  So if you're able to sustain 1s3r as a dagger rogue (which basically necessitates 2/5 T4) it tends to be a good choice.<br>
<br>
<i>Q: This sheet gives different answers than the Rogue DPS sheet for the value of item/buff/talent point/whatever X.  </i>What gives?<br>
A: At the risk of sounding like an ass: because this sheet is right and the other is wrong.<br>
<br>
To expand on that a bit: there are a number of modeling differences between this and the Rogue DPS sheet, so they will frequently generate different answers for the value of various pieces of gear.  Thus, they disagree because one is more accurately modeling the effect than the other.  As a general rule, I'm of the opinion that the accuracy of this sheet is higher (although I may be biased - if I didn't believe that, I wouldn't have bothered creating this sheet.)  Ultimately, it's a matter of which sheet you trust more, and that you need to decide for yourself. <br>
<br>
<i>Q: If I have item A equipped, it shows item B as being better, but if I switch to item B, it shows item A as being better.  What gives?</i><br>
A: The item evaluations in this sheet are based off your current gear; hence, if you change what you have equipped, the relative value of other items can change; hence, loops like the one described do arise when two items are very close in overall quality.  As such, any item difference less than 5 AP or so should be taken with a grain of salt; it's hard to resolve differences on that scale.  If, however, you are serious about knowing which has higher damage output, you can take a look at the "Rough DPS Estimate" cell to see which produces a higher value.<br>
<i><br>
Q: Why does the "current hit" box disagree with the armory?</i><br>
A: "Current Hit" includes any buffs you may have, and the default buffs include Spicy Hot Talbuk.  Hence, if you haven't changed the buffs, the sheet should report 20 hit more than the armory.  If it is still off, I would doublecheck your gems.<br>
<br>
<b>Questions from previous versions</b><br>
<br>
<i>Q: What does "Optimal Hit" mean?</i><br>
A: Optimal Hit reflects the amount of hit rating if you socketed and enchanted your current gear optimally. For exactly what is considered to be optimal for you, consult the middle gear column. Optimal Hit *doesn't* have anything to do with the hit cap - is just an indication of how much hit you'd have if you socketed according to the recommendations in the middle column. This is primarily intended as a warning mechanism, as, in general, "optimal" involves socketing stuff with a whole lot of +8 hit gems, which will frequently put you over the hit cap - the Optimal Hit number is designed to warn you about this so you know not to socket so overwhelmingly with hit.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">1) I don't need a DPS spreadsheet to tell me how much damage I do; all I need is Recap (or equivalent).

</div>Agreed; some of this can be done.  However, the next-stat computations in the rogue dps spreadsheet are sort of patched on - they don't run through the computation path as the actual damage calculations.  And some effects (Mongoose, for instance) aren't addressed by the next-stat computations at all - there's no easy way to compare the value of Mongoose to the value of some other stat.  Many set bonuses can't be equated to next-stat computations.  At the end of the day: yes, it can be hacked to do approximations of item quality in many cases - but it's not what it was designed to do.  My goal is to write a spreadsheet where that *is* what it's designed to do.<br>
<br>
As another example - consider Dragonspine Trophy.  Right now it's being modeled in the Rogue DPS spreadsheet as a static 40 AP and 120 haste rating, when in reality the proc mechanic is far more complex - but there's just no easy way to implement that in the original spreadsheet (or at least, no one has done it yet).  This spreadsheet actually models it as a proc - and, resultingly, gets some significantly different - and interesting - results... namely, that equipping Dragonspine Trophy *dramatically* increases the value of hit rating, which is a subtlety that the other spreadsheet doesn't pick up on.<br>
<br>
As I say: I'm not arguing that the other spreadsheet doesn't have it's place - but I think it's more of a shotgun solution to question of rogue dps.  It will tell you where in general terms the answer lies, but it's unable to model some of the subtleties introduced by high-end itemization.  It is my intention here to right a scalpel rather than a shotgun, so one can really delve into the fine points of high-end itemization and figure out the best possible way of getting to the top.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>So, the character screen (which may or may not be accurate, but that's a separate issue) actually displays .04% crit per point of weapon skill - so that's what I put in.  Now, the patch notes assert that against higher-level mobs, you get more (the .1% to which you refer) - but I haven't really seen any external confirmation of that, so left it out for the moment.  It would certainly be easy enough to change if the community decides that it is likely correct.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Played around with it a bit, showed some very different results when compared to the spreadsheet, namely: as your haste ratings go up, the value of +hit skyrockets. Particularly noticeable when changing from, say, DST+Abacus and Thundering Skyfire to something like Hourglass+Romeo's and Swift Skyfire. Is the Thundering Skyfire supposed to be that imba compared to the other meta gems? :P<br>
<br>
Another difference I noticed was the marked difference in the Netherblade 2/5's DPS value in your sheet compared to the DPS spreadsheet. Does it really add that little?<br>

</div>So, addressing this set in reverse order: I have no actual data on the proc rate of TSD, so I estimated it as 1 PPM.  Whether this is even remotely close to correct, I have no idea; I've been unable to get ahold of one.  So it is possible that that value is somewhat inflated.<br>
<br>
That said: Haste is really dang powerful, so it almost certainly *is* the best metagem.  However, if the proc rate turns out to be lower, it won't be first by so ridiculously much.<br>
<br>
As for the increase of the value of hit rating: it is certainly possible that I made a mistake in my calculations somewhere - if someone would like to review the calculation sheets and make sure they're sensible, I'd greatly appreciate it.  However, the answer is plausible to me.  Why?  Well, first, the more haste you have, the more white damage you're doing, so it's certainly plausible that that's going to increase the value of hit.  However, I think the larger effect is: Dragonspine (and TSD, as modeled) are HUGELY powerful procs, and if you have one (or both) on your gear, you gain significant amounts of dps just by proccing them more - hence it becomes of crucial importance to hit as often as possible, to get procs as often as possible.  This feedback mechanism - more hit gives more procs gives more haste - isn't modeled at all in the dps spreadsheet.  Both TSD and Dragonspine are modeled with a flat amount of +haste.  So my explanation would be: powerful procs give a significant boost to the value of hit, which is not modeled correctly in the other spreadsheet due to the constraints on it's construction - it is this sort of behavior that is the exact reason I made this spreadsheet.<br>
<br>
...either that, or I messed up.  Time will tell.<br>

</div>Short answer: um, apparently so...<br>
<br>
Long answer: the dagger model makes spectacularly inefficient use of the extra SnD uptime (because it's always using 5/5/3 and wasting any extra SnD uptime), so it probably *does* undervalue Netherblade 2/5.  I haven't figured out how the dagger cycle should change with increased energy regen/longer SnD uptime/similar effects - it just always uses 5/5/3<br>
<br>
Now, the sword cycle actually does modify the cycle - it's doing Xs/5r, and computing the optimal X, so the 2/5 bonus is dropping it from ~3s/5r to 1s/5r.  Thing is, most of what that buys you is increased rupture uptime, which isn't a huge dps upgrade - if you look at the 1s/5r, 2s/5r, and 3s/5r cycles in the dps spreadsheet, they're really pretty close in terms of damage output.  So my argument would be: for swords, yes, it really is worth that little.<br>

</div>Well, that's reassuring - another set of calculations that give similar answers certainly increases my confidence that I didn't screw things up too badly.<br>
<br>
That said, we are a fair bit off in terms of the value of crit, so I was looking at that a bit, and I noticed that your numbers aren't self-consistant... you sure that crit number is right?  Consider:  It takes 22.077 crit rating for 1% crit, so by your numbers 1% crit is worth 22.077*1.74 = 38.41 AP.  40 points of agi also give 1% crit, so the crit on agi is worth 38.41/40 = .96 AP.  Since agi also gives 1 point of AP, the value of a point of agility is then 1.96 AP.  However, 1 point of agi on gear actually gives 1.12 real agi (due to kings and vitality), so the total value for a point of agi on gear is 1.12*1.96 = 2.2 AP, which is significantly higher than the 2.13 value you reported.<br>

Currently you store the enchant slot type (head, gloves, bracer) in the name of the enchant.  You would do better by simply listing all the enchants and having a second column for slot type.<br>

</div>If you'd like to clean up the UI, that would be fantastic; I've known since about the 2nd day I started working on this sheet that it desparately needed a new UI, but I'm a relative Excel novice so had to settle for strictly functional to start with.  The changes you propose defenitely sounds like they would help.e pie<br>
<br>
With regards to your point c in particular, I think the ideal would be to have a column in the gear sheets that marks where the given item drops, and then generate a "largest upgrades from each location" chart somewhere - i.e., "these are the largest upgrades from heroics", "these are the largest upgrades from karazhan" and so on - then you could just look at which instances are available to you (given current guild progression) and figure out your priority list.  In a totally ideal world it might even specify which boss within the instance drops it, although that might be fancier than is needed.<br>
<br>
I think the talents could also use drop-down boxes to specify your current build rather than the current "fill in a number" system - and, honestly, replacing the "put a 1 in this column if you have it" mechanic with checkboxes might be a good idea too.<br>
<br>
Also, there are some paramaters that are currently hard-coded that could probably use a selection screen somewhere, notably:<br>
<br>
*Character Race (currently hardcoded to NE)<br>
*Boss Armor Value (currently hardcoded to 5k)<br>
*Offense-to-Defense ratio (i.e., how much effective stamina is worth relative to effective AP - it's currently hardcoded to 1 sta = .6 AP, but that should ultimately be tweakable so people who want more or less stamina can do so)<br>
*Avoidable and Mitigable attacks (from the defense sheet; what portion of attacks coming at you can be avoided (dodged) or mitigated (via armor).  I made up numbers, but it might be worth making those adjustable.)<br>
<br>
Another thing that would be worth having is a display somewhere that indicates if the current gear input is over the hit cap, and by how much;  I specifically coded the sheet so that it doesn't immediately drop the score of all your gear with hit rating just because you're at the hit cap; but because of this, you can't easily tell if you're above the hit cap.  As such, there probably should be a warning button for it.<br>
<br>
For that matter, having a display that indicates what cycle it is using for combat swords would probably make sense.<br>
<br>
Basically, in needs a summary screen at the front that gives easy access to most important features and information, such that people don't need to much around in the bowels of the sheet to get useful information out of the sheet.<br>
<br>
...I just realized I named off an awful lot of features that I'd like to see.  Don't feel obligated to do all this - I'm just sort of making a wish list.  But any help you (or anyone) wishes to provide with improving the usability of the sheet would be appreciated, as if you wait for me to figure out enough Excel to get it running, you're gonna be in for a long wait .<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I guess I'm not quite seeing what this buys you; I did it this way because I felt it was the clearest way to select what enchant you were using in what slot, and getting an immediate comparison to other enchants available in that slot.

</div>Yes; a weapon type column would be a good idea; you'll note that the current means of weapon determination is a total hack.

</div>Actually, I think the ideal would be to have a drop-down menu for each socket allowing you to select the socketing for that item, and then have it automatically detect whether the socket bonus should be active.  The challenging part is finding a place to store the socket bonus information; right now it's just lumped in with the other stats of the item.  You'd need some field or set of fields somewhere that describes the socket bonus information, which is then added in if the socketing matches... I just haven't figure out a good way of organizing this.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Yeah - I pulled that number out of the existing rogue dps spreadsheet since it matched my own observations pretty well - I'd pinned it down to agi/40 with a base crit value of about -.29%, as opposed to the current model where the base crit is -11.5/40 = -.2875%<br>

As an update on the current state of developement of this sheet: Darlal is currently making some significant UI improvements that should make it both easier to use and develop.  He's sent me a rough cut of it, and it looks really good so far.  The 0.3 release will probably consist primarily of his UI changes and the addition of the new items from the test realm that have been found in the past few days; I'm working on resolutions to the current issues with the model (such as the requirement than MH and OH weapons be of the same type, a model for T5 4/5, a dynamically generated dagger cycle, and a fix for the general kludginess of the haste proc model) but have no immediate estimate as to when those will be ready.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_359649"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I like the simplicity of this spreadsheet.  To be honest, I've always found the "sustained dps" model the other spreadsheet follows to be, well, hyper inflated.  With my gear and max buffs I can attain in a raid environment, the spreadsheet would show numbers in the 1400 range, whereas I can possibly push 940-960 on Mag near the tail end of the encounter.  I understand why the number gets so large, but it isn't something I would like to see, which is the reason you designed your sheet.<br>
<br>
So I guess which is to be trusted?  I feel your sheet, when looking just at base dps, falls more inline with what I am capable of in any given instance on any given boss that sits still for more than a minute.  I like how in perfect situations (read: Gruul with minimal cave-ins) I've reached 900 dps and the sheet tells me I should be getting base 877 with my current gear, no buffs, and about 932 with correct trinkets and typical raid buffs and a few potions.  I feel that's more accurate than the original DPS spreadsheet which shows 990 and 1220 dps, respectively.<br>
<br>
I'm still skeptical, but am glad there is an option to test the original.<br>
<br>
I would like to know why you chose the dagger build you did.  I have always used the following:<br>
<br>
<a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?talent=w0efooZ0eVbbEz0MMRtV" target="_blank">http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=w0efooZ0eVbbEz0MMRtV</a><br>
<br>
whereas you use something more inline with:<br>
<br>
<a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?talent=i0gcoLZMIVbbEz0MMRtV" target="_blank">http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=i0gcoLZMIVbbEz0MMRtV</a><br>
<br>
which I really don't expect to do more damage.  Mostly based off my own experience, but also of course the original DPS spreadsheet.  Is there numeric backing as to why yours will do more damage?  You also seem to "hardcore" the original Assassination / Combat talents, whereas you leave the remaining to be changed.  Could you provide an option to modify the talents a bit more?<br>
<br>
So far, it looks solid.  I'm hoping we get more heads to bang on this sheet and work out the kinks, if any, and provide a more realistic gear comparison sheet.  Great work so far.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Well, my initial comment would be: the two builds you describe are both described fairly well by the sheet.  Yours only differs from what the sheet supports in that it has 3/3 Ruthlessness instead of 2/3 - everything else you can enter in just fine.  And while that certainly is going to make *some* difference in terms of sustained dps output, I don't think it's crippling to the sheet - the answers you get will still be close.<br>
<br>
In terms of the relative merit of the two builds: with the gear I will be wearing as soon as 2.1 comes out, the build you propose is only marginally superior against the targets that murder affects, and clearly inferior against everything else.  In particular, pulling a point out of Lethality to get the last point of Ruthlessness drops me by ~3 dps both buffed and unbuffed.  So while you can argue the merits of dropping Lethality in favor of Murder, I think it is correct to keep Ruthlessness at 2/3 - in which case, you're back in the realm of what the sheet can do.<br>
<br>
As to allowing more talents to be changed: the fundamental issue is one of cycle determination.  The rogue dps spreadsheet computes cycles by simply trying all possible cycles and figuring out which one happens to be best; the problem is, this creates all manner of issues with circular references once you deal with armor penetration procs and the like.  This sheet takes a different approach; it takes the lessons learned in that sheet about which sorts of cycles tend to be optimal, and computes directly what the optimal cycle is going to be.<br>
<br>
The problem with this is: cycles can reasonably be broken down into families (i.e. 5s/5r/Xe, Xs/5r, etc.) and while it is straightforward to compute the optimal member of a given family, it's extremely hard to compare across families.  Hence, the talent selections are constrained so as to keep all possible answers in the same family.<br>
<br>
In the case of swords, for instance: the calculations are built around using Xs/5r as the main cycle.  However, if your energy regeneration is too low, this will not be sustainable.  Hence, the energy-affecting talents (Relentless Strikes, Imp SS, AR, and Combat Potency) are all on the list of required talents; if you don't have these, your energy generation might not be sufficient to sustain 5s/5r, at which point you need to drop down to 5s/5r/3s, which the sheet just simply cannot handle.  The other talents on the "required" list are there for similar reasons - it's because if they were allowed to vary, you'd risk moving out of the range of cycles the sheet is designed to handle.  Hence, I just hardcoded them to what I believed to be the most common values, and let everything else vary.<br>
<br>
Now, as for daggers: I haven't done much work with the cycle model, so I can't tell you for certain which talents are required - I just coded up 5/5/3 with the combat daggers build I use as a rough cut.  Eventually, however, I hope to have a dynamically adjusted family of attack rotations for daggers as I do for swords, at which point what's required may change.  Although, in all honesty, Ruthlessness has a fairly profound effect on dagger rotations, so that one is unlikely to be available for change.<br>
<br>
Long story short: I made as many options as I could changable.  However, the structure of the sheet coerces certain restrictions on talent builds, so I am forces to restrict some as well.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_360823"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->1) At the moment, the way to do this is to pull up the "armor" sheet and see which have higher scores and which have lower scores.  We're working on UI improvements for this; we're currently a planning a "largest upgrades from instance X" table - i.e. a list of the largest upgrades available in Karazhan, or in Heroics, or in SSC - or whatever.  In terms of differences within a particular slot - it would be straightforward to add a column to the armor sheet that would give the difference between a piece of equipment and your current gear - do people think this would be helpful?<br>
<br>
2) Expected DPS is sort of buried in the sheet right now - if you look at the end of column B on the sword or dagger sheet (as appropriate), you will find a dps number.  Since this was initially designed as a gear comparison tool rather than an explicit dps calculator, I didn't initially worry about making it particularly user-accessible.  However, again, if it's a feature people think is helpful, it's not a hard feature to add to display that dps number in a more prominent location.<br>
<br>
3) The offense values are in Effective AP.  The defense values are in Effective Stamina.  The total column is a weighted sum of the two (speficially, offense + .6 * defense).<br>
<br>
And as a general update on progress: we're almost ready to release 0.4; we've been held up by some compatability issues between Excel and OpenOffice, but are getting close to a completed revision, which will include, among other things, the improved UI, full socketing support, the new test realm items, and an updated of Warp Spring Coil to reflect the recent change to it on test.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_360939"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->This looks promising. I like that the gear selection is limited to the higher-end items and I don't have to go through a bunch of garbage I'd never wear.<br>
<br>
I do notice it's missing a few gems (Bright Living Ruby, Bold Ornate Ruby, Jagged Talasite, notably). Is that just part of 0.3's socketing being non-functional? I'd also prefer that the gems show the stats rather than, or in addition to, the names. I always get the names mixed up <br>
<br>
Small UI suggestion. The drop-down arrow on each piece of gear partially covers the rating next to it. If you're just going through each piece seeing how it changes the rating, it's a minor annoyance to click off the selection cell. Making the value cell a bit wider is probably enough of a fix.<br>

General theory to gear selection is to take the best thing that can be gotten out of 5 mans, and anything better - theory being that any serious raider should be at that gear level.  By that logic, I suppose Sun Gilded Shouldercaps - and maybe Warp Splinter's Thorn, and a few others - should work their way in.

		<div id="post_message_362020"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->As a note, the fix I will most likely be going with for the enchants is to enforce unique names.  Mongoose will become Mongoose (MH) and Mongoose (OH).  <br>
<br>
FYI, there is also a very slight calculation error in the total values for weapons and armor (1-3 points, max).  These will all be fixed in the next release.<br>
<br>
Please keep your wish list coming and I'll keep adding features (within reason).  Soon to come: personalized balances between offense and defensive stats and zone information/filters.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>An answer in two parts:<br>
<br>
1) Possibly, although I personally have no idea how to do so.<br>
2) And if you did manage to do it, you'd need to be careful about it; the itemization is restricted in part to keep the players stats within a fairly narrow range, to simplify the calculations.  There is a risk of the cycle computation etc. breaking if your gear is too odd.  This is mostly a problem with OH speed, but if your hit chance gets too low you could also run into trouble.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>All the 2.1 stats are in, although some of them are estimated.  The only 2.1 change I haven't fully addressed is the fact that sword spec is a yellow attack now; I changed the sheet to reflect that it no longer resets the swing timer, but I haven't heard any confirmation of which miss rate it uses or whether it can glance; if that has changed, it's not implemented.<br>
<br>
There are some estimates in the sheet as well, that I'd like to pin down better.  In terms of specific mechanics in need of testing:<br>
<br>
Glancing Blow Rate<br>
Glancing Blow Severity<br>
Sword Spec - which miss rate does it use?  can it glance?<br>
Effect of weapon skill<br>
TSD Proc Rate<br>
R+J trinket proc rate<br>
Dragonspine proc rate<br>
Deathmantle 4/5 proc rate<br>
Typical armor for sundered raid bosses<br>
<br>
Some of these have received discussion on various threads, but I'm not aware of a definitive answer having been reached for any of them.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<!-- message -->
		<div id="post_message_362996"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->A few things now that I'm looking over .4:<br>
<br>
1. For some reason no matter what I do, I can't get the Thundering Skyfire Gem to activate, and even when I changed the formula to correctly count the colored gems out of their correct cells (and got activate to change to 1) it didn't add the EAP to the talent_gear sheet.<br>
<br>
1a The activation formula for Thundering Skyfire seems to be set at "requires at least 3 gems of every type" - the screenshots I've seen (albiet, I might be missing something having been changed on test) show that it requires at least 4 each of red/blue/yellow gems.<br>
<br>
1b Shifting Nightseye isn't being counted as a red gem, when it should be. (matches red/blue).<br>
<br>
2. Suggestion that you add Drakefang Talisman to the trinket sheet.  With my gear/spec, it's better than the Hourglass (though, that's because my crit rating is in the toilet, but still), and it's roughly equivalent to the Bloodlust Brooch.  I've already added it to my sheet, so I suppose that's totally up to you.<br>
<br>
3. Another suggestion: Changing the suggested upgrades so it shows the 3 next best pieces?  My group is currently clearing Kara, so while I know the Slayer's set is better, I also don't have any realistic expectation to be seeing Slayer's gear in the near future.  I totally accept that this could be a "this sheet is designed for people who are w/in a tier or 2 of the top end gear", but I thought it might be a nice addition for those of us who aren't. <!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_363007"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Is there any intention of including some alternate specs, by which I really mean Mutilate? <br>
<br>
Bleedo's sheet (actually Miq's latest sheet) has me at 90-95% of what I could theorycraft as combat daggers using a Sunblade offhand depending on raid buffs. To me that's high enough to be included as 'viable in PVE' especially with a lot of fights that decrease a rogue's TOT during which the extra yellow damage and fast CP generation of the build shine.<br>
<br>
I appreciate all the work you're doing and just wanted to know if a) the cycles could cope with a radically different set of talents and b) if there was a plan to do so eventually.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Is there any intention of including some alternate specs, by which I really mean Mutilate? <br>
<br>
Bleedo's sheet (actually Miq's latest sheet) has me at 90-95% of what I could theorycraft as combat daggers using a Sunblade offhand depending on raid buffs. To me that's high enough to be included as 'viable in PVE' especially with a lot of fights that decrease a rogue's TOT during which the extra yellow damage and fast CP generation of the build shine.<br>
<br>
I appreciate all the work you're doing and just wanted to know if a) the cycles could cope with a radically different set of talents and b) if there was a plan to do so eventually.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>The cycles are currently coded to very specific rotations; they couldn't even really do Shiv or Hemo, much less Mutilate right now.<br>
<br>
As for the potential for adding such a thing: it would certainly be possible to do so, but it would be a fairly significant amount of work.  I was currently planning to try to clean up the existing features some more (i.e., working through the "known issue" list) before I worried too much about significantly expanding the functionality.  However, if I hear a high level of demand for alternate builds, I might reconsider that course of action.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_363777"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->As Aldriana stated, we're working on some more fine-tuned gear upgrade recommendations.  <br>
<br>
In terms of trinkets being counted in the gear values, the current trinkets have a large effect on the relative values of the stats, so in that sense they are included.  <br>
<br>
I will look over TSD issues, I took my 3 number from wowhead (wasn't on ptr), but I'll double check the actual values tonight.  <br>
<br>
I didn't make any updates yesterday due to patch excitement.  I'll have a small amount of time today, but I wouldn't expect anything new until tomorrow realistically.<br>
<br>
In terms of mutilate (which i also use), it would be possible to re-do the cycles for mutilate, but that would be a totally different sheet.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the shifting nightseye catch!  All gems currently should be added to each color they correspond to (notice glinting noble topaz is there twice).<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
In general, keep in mind that all upgrades are scored using your current items.  That means that if changing trinkets would seriously alter the relative value of stats, the optimal upgrades might change.  There are ways for me to suggest overall optimization but they are (a)much better done with a database (if this seems worthwhile I wouldn't be opposed to it), (b) require cyclic arguments, making the sheet very sensitive and especially platform dependent, and (c) make the final results a bit harder to interpret.<br>
<br>
Before making final gear decisions I would change balance-altering items (TSD, warp-spring coil, etc...) first and see if the optimal upgrades remain fairly steady.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I've actually toyed with the idea of moving away from a spreadsheet format to avoid some of the limitations of the format; I think the ideal tool would have an initial UI akin to the old CTProfiles site, i.e., a full talent calculator and character sheet page where you can enter your gear and talents.  It would probably also want to have an option to fetch your current stats and abilities from the Armory.  Then, under the hood, it could go through and do all these calculations in painstaking detail, and provide summary pages indexed by more or less anything you wanted to sort by.  On the whole, I think it would make a pretty cool tool, and while I'd be happy to code the underlying computations, my GUI programming skills aren't up to the level that would be required for the project.  But if anyone wants to work on putting such a thing together, give me a whistle .<br>
<br>
In terms of optomization strategy: figuring out what, in the long run, is the highest dps option tends not to be particularly hard; the challenge is figuring out how to get from point A to point B.  I generally take an incremental approach and start with my current gear, then add in the largest reasonably obtainable upgrades and see how much this changes things.  In general, the answer is "not too much", but there are some effects (Dragonspine Trophy and TSD, notably) that have a huge impact on the value of stats (hit, in this case) that can change the order of things.<br>
<br>
However, the general optomization strategy for someone in early 25man content tends to work out to:<br>
<br>
1) get Dragonspine Trophy<br>
2) get to the hit cap<br>
3) profit<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I'm not sure I'd actually set it up as a webform - it's certainly an option, but I was originially thinking in terms of a program that you'd download and run locally - although that would require either bundling with a database program (probably sqlite) or getting by without a database per se (which would probably be possible if a bit messy).  Running it as a webform would defenitely have some advantages in terms of setup, although also would require resolving issues of hosting and whatever.<br>
<br>
I assume by advantage A you're referring to the ability to support the full range of specs and abilities?  I'd personally be reinclined to redo all the calculations from scratch rather than using his particular formulas, to take full advantage of the flexibility that actual code gives you.  That's to some extent what I was doing here, but the nature of the spreadsheet is such that I had to limit myself to a small slice of rogue-dom.  With the power of actually programming behind it, it would be straightforward to have calculations at or above this level of detail with all possible specs - although it'd take some time to code.<br>
<br>
Regarding the disadvantages: I don't think a) wouldn't really be a problem; we've already started to run into compatability issues with spreadsheets due to the differences between Excel and OpenOffice; I think getting to the same level of compatability would be pretty doable.  A webform would certainly be able to do as well, and even a locally run program could be structured to work on most flavors of Windows and MacOS with relative ease.  Point b) is something of a concern - it would take some time to put such a tool together, but it sounds like we've already found a couple people willing to work on the back-end; if we could find some people to write the front-end this might be possible.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Anyway, on another topic.  I've been thinking alot about the zone-selection option.  Instead of going with zone-selection I was thinking about using item ilvl to determine what items a player has access too.  In general each zone is +5-10 ilevel over the previous zones (with final bosses being a bit higher than that still).  For instance, if you select ilvl 120, you'd be selecting all gear from 5-mans, heroics, and kara (minus the prince and tier 4).  There could of course be tweaks/exceptions (the prince's drops and tier 4 helms/gloves could be considered ilvl 120 for instence).  What do you think?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_364369"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->That might be a reasonable way of filtering, but I personally like the idea of having someway of saying "these are your upgrades, and this is where to get them".  Knowing that something drops somewhere in Karazhan is useful; knowing that it drops off Netherspite is even better.  I was thinking of adding two columns to the armor page, one for which general instance things drop in (i.e. SSC, TK, Kara, etc.) which could be used for filtering purposes, and then a second column that would list specific drop information ("Heroic Black Morass", "Netherspite", "Lady Vashj", etc.) So you could, for instance, search for all upgrades in Karazhan, and it would return a list saying:<br>
<br>
Spiteblade is a 50 AP upgrade from Netherspite<br>
Netherblade Helm is a 30 AP upgrade from Prince<br>

		<div id="post_message_364643"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Some quick impressions and comments.<br>
Overall I like the idea a lot. Especially once more specific filtering is enabled. It's tedious at best to sort through all the gear choices looking for upgrades. This tool has the potential to make it far less painful<br>
<br>
However it needs either a simple set of instructions so users can enter gear easily or much more gear. Using me as an example - We're still in Kara, I understand that Black Temple gear is better than what I have now, but if I can't even enter the gear I have now its usefulness seems limited.<br>
<br>
What is the number that it's actually calculating? I noticed that if I leave most of the talents alone at their default values but reduce the poison one to zero I get a value of say 3793. If I then put the poison value back to 3 the value decreases to 3790. I admit the change is very slight, I just don't know why it would go down by making poisons more effective.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_364645"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->The scores are admittedly sort of abstract right now - they're based on AP-equivalent points. So removing the point in poisons drops your dps by about 3AP-equivalent.<br>
<br>
As for adding items - it's admittedly a bit challenging right now.  If there's specific things you feel should be added, feel free to list them and I'll add them; however, please recall that the goal of this sheet is not to include every item that any rogue might have; the itemization starts with level 70 5-man blues, with the idea that these should be obtainable by any remotely serious raider without undo effort.  So if there are specific level 70 blue (or easier to obtain) items you'd like added, I can add them - but I'm not going to put in just anything.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
In terms of RAP (relative AP) increasing after you removed poison talents, this could be because some of your other stats are slightly more valuable wihtout poison talents.<br>
<br>
For instance, if you have full 5/5 imp 5/5 vile in a mutilate build, a faster offhand is superior in dps by a large margin.  If you have 0/5 imp 0/5 vile, a slower offhand will net you similar, or slightly better dps.  Thus given your weapons, removing poinson talents could actually increase the value of some of your items (sorry for using mutilate, it's what came to mind).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_365770"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Dragonspine Trophy is such a powerful proc that it greatly increases the value of hit - since misses don't proc.  Hence, you want to miss as little as possible.  In practice, it elevates the value of hit to the point where optimal gear generally allows you to get to the point where you never miss (once your miss rate is 0%, further +hit is useless).  The amount of hit required for this to happen is known as the "hit cap".<br>
<br>
The currently accepted value for this (and the one used in this spreadsheet) is that this requires 25.5% total hit; for a rogue with combat potency and weapon expertise but no other sources of +skill, this requires 307.5 hit rating.  Depending on your stats, the exact number will be a bit different.<br>
<br>
"Profit" is an allusion to underwear gnomes, representing the fact that performing the first two steps leads to an advantageous outcome.<br>
<br>
In reality, the situation is a bit more complicated; not all items with +hit are created equal, and once you get to the hit cap their is still a reasonable amount of flexibility in itemization; as a general rule you want to be stacking AP and Agi more than crit past this point, but to get the precise rubrics, a gander at this or the other rogue spreadsheet is recommended.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Eventually, this might be possible.  It's pretty darn hard to do, though.<br>
<br>
First, the daggers case: the fastest possible OHs are 1.3 speed, and you have no poison talents to assign.  DP thus ticks off for 225 (and basically never goes down) every 3 seconds, or 75 dps.<br>
<br>
IP hits for 170, so you need to average 75/170 = .44 procs per second to do as much damage.  Since it procs 20% of the time, this means you need to hit 2.2 times per second.  Assuming you never miss or are dodged (which isn't possible with current itemization), it would require a 2.87x  increase in attack speed over the base speed of the weapon.  You get a 1.3x increase from SnD, 1.025x from pro-rated Blade Flurry, and ~1.02x from average mongoose uptime on both hands.  This means that you need to get roughly a 2.11x increase in weapon speed from haste rating, which requires 1167 haste rating to obtain.  Even if you somehow managed 100% uptime on both TSD and Dragonspine, that's only 565, and there's just not enough haste rating on other items to get another 600, nor do I expect there to be anytime soon.<br>
<br>
Now, sword spec, optimally speaking, gets 4 points to put in poison talents, so the relevant comparison is DP with 4/5 Vile vs IP with 4/5 Imp.  Deadly Poison with 4/5 Vile ticks off for 261 every 3 seconds, which is 87 dps, which requires .512 procs per second; with a 28% proc rate and assuming attacks never miss or are dodged, this requires 1.83 attacks per second.  With the fastest possible sword OH (1.4 speed), this would require 2.56x attack speed increase, which works out to about.... 928 haste rating.  Again, that's still well out of reach of current itemization.<br>
<br>
So, briefly: From a theoretical perspective, it's possible, but in practice, it ain't gonna happen.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Also, the Socket Bonus? column is actually telling you if it is optimal to go after the socket bonus, not if you already have it (this should be made more clear on the sheet).<br>
<br>
I'm more worried about the fel leather boots in the image above.  I thought I'd quashed all the counting bugs where it showed the "optimal" as worse than the current, but I clearly missed one.  I'll go try to hunt it down.</div>

</div>Oh wow, I didn't realize that's what that column meant.  Thanks. :]<br>
<br>
I guess it would be difficult, but is there a way for the spreadsheet to know if your meta gem is active?  The way it suggests I set up my gems would turn off my meta, so I can't go for the optimal setup.  I try not to rely on sheets too much, anyway, but it's just something I noticed.<br>
<br>
And the reason the optimal is being showed as negative is because it suggests I use Cat's Swiftness rather than Dexterity... if you assigned a value to the run speed higher than 6 agility's worth, then that would fix the problem, I think.  It is difficult to come up with a value for runspeed as the whole purpose is sustained nonmobile dps.  Perhaps just make it such that Cat's Swiftness isn't suggested?</div>

		<div id="post_message_366519">There is no value associated with the speed increase, and I don't think there are any plans to add one.  The purpose of this sheet is to optimize gear for damage, not additional effects.<br>
<br>
Meta gems:  Currently the sheet does track which gems are active, but it does not use this information anyplace.  The reason for this is that it gets really difficult to optimize gear with 3 rounds of iteration without switching to a database (see previous discussion).<br>
<br>
For example:<br>
<br>
here's what the statement is:<br>
if Added RAP (relative attack power) from best metagem &gt; RAP lost by replacing gems with other color gems -&gt; resocket gear to activate the gems<br>
<br>
what we do currently:<br>
<br>
a) determine the RAP of current armor ungemmed<br>
b) determine if it is better to socket the armor with all of the top gem, or to get the socket bonus<br>
c) determine which metagems are active with this configuration<br>
______________________________________________________<br>
<br>
this is what we would need to do:<br>
<br>
a) determine the RAP of current armor ungemmed<br>
b) determine if it is better to socket the armor with all of the top gem, or to get the socket bonus<br>
c) determine which metagems are active with this configuration<br>
d) compare current total value with total value using the best metagem<br>
     i) figure out what gems need to be added to activate the best metagem<br>
     ii) figure out which gems provide the least RAP difference when replaced (this needs to include socket bonuses)<br>
    <br>
adding D requires a full gemming module, not a string of if-&gt;then logic.  It's not impossible, but it's not in at the moment.<br>
<br>
The easiest way to do this in excel that I can think of is to create a matrix of gemming options (alreaady parially done) for each armor piece.<br>
<br>
Create a new matrix of all values and counts of gems for each color that would activate the optimal meta gem that includes socket bonuses (this is not easy and requires sorting options that basic excel doesn't seem to have).<br>
<br>
Compare the sum of the individual maximums with the sum of the meta-active maximums.<br>
<br>
Anyway, it's not impossible, but it's not something that will be done right away.  Just use common sense and replace your weakest gems first.</div>

		<div id="post_message_368392">Yes, it currently pays no attention to the hit cap.  When I was writing the initial version, it kept confusing the heck out me that the value of a piece of gear would suddenly drop by a third the instant you hit the hit cap, which isn't an accurate assessment of the situation at all; the value of that piece of gear is as high as ever, it's just that the combination of gear you happen to be using has a little too much +hit on it.  So I specifically calculated the incremental value of hit in a way that ignores the hit cap entirely.<br>
<br>
The problem with this solution, of course, is that it'll keep recommending high hit items even after you're hit capped, so specific upgrades off whatever gear you happen to be wearing might not actually be upgrades due to the hit mechanics.  It's not clear to me if there's a better way of doing this in the end, since high hit items *are* good and *should* score highly - they just shouldn't be recommended as upgrades for people already at the hit cap. Unfortunately, I can't think of any good way of writing that into the spreadsheet.<br>
<br>
As a short term solution, we're planning on adding a message warning you when you're over the hit cap, so at least you're aware that there's an issue.</div>

</div>Not really, no.  In addition to moving all the forumlas, you need to redefine the named ranges to include the new items.  Also, copying the forumlas straight over tends not to work exactly, since not all the formulas have dollar signs everywhere they're needed to make the formulas directly copy.<br>
<br>
Honestly, given the frequency with which new releases of the sheet are coming out right now, the recommended way of getting an item into the sheet is to post it in this thread, and I'll add it the next release (assuming it strikes me as worth adding, anyway - again, I'm trying to limit this to 5-man blues and up).</div>

But what i would appreciate most would be something showing hit-rating / hit% on the gear page or a piece of code preventing us going over 25.5% hit to make sure you dont waste itemvalue. Something like 2 value colums, so you can evalute when you hit the cap to drop a low value hit item and grap a high value hit item, exchanging the low value hit item with another high value no hit dps piece.<br>

		<div id="post_message_368424">Okay - I'll make a point to add those next release.  I punched them into a copy of the sheet I have on hand, and as a short answer:<br>
<br>
Don Alejandro's is comperable to Belt of One Thousand Deaths<br>
Hyjal Rings, at least at the rep levels in Wowhead, aren't particularly interesting.<br>
Shadowmoon Destoyer's Drape and Telonicus's Pendant of Mayhem are the best available pieces for their slot that I've seen to date.<br>
Terrok's Might is crap.<br>
Leggings of Murderous Attempt are a slight dps upgrade over T5 and a significant sta downgrade, causing their composite score to be almost identical.<br>
<br>
As a tip: one thing that works well if you want to compare new pieces of gear is to replace one of the existing items in the sheet - just pick an item that there's no chance you're going to use, and overwrite the name + stats with the new gear.  I.e., if you want to add more items below the low end of the sheet, overwrite some of the high end items that you won't get to for a while; if you want to add more high-end items, ovewrite some of the low-end blues that are inferior to what you have.</div>

</div>I've seen it, yes.  I left it out of the sheet because, stated briefly: it's crap, and a royal pain to model.  If people really want to see it, I can add it, I guess - but there's no circumstance under which I can imagine using it, so...<br>

</div>It's what I refer to as EAP - that would be "Effective Attack Power".  I've always normalized my calculations with 1 AP = 1 point rather than 1 Agi = 1 point (as is true for AEP), so that's what I did in the sheet.  <br>
<br>
The problem I have with AEP is that Agility provides both offensive and defensive benefits, so it's hard to separate the benefits of an item into offensive and defensive; therefore, I score offense in effective AP, defense in effective Stamina, and then combine them to get an overall score that is normalized so 1 AP = 1 point. <br>

</div>It's base stats plus the NE racial +1% dodge - purely because that was trivial to add, and I'm an NE .<br>
<br>
In terms of adding the other racial benefits - it's certainly something that could be done, but I'd need some help figuring out the actual game effect of them.<br>

</div>So far I've only been updating it for revisions - the development periods are short enough that I haven't felt a need to update the bug list between releases.<br>
<br>
If you don't mind doing a bit of digging, you can also read through the thread to find when things were released, since I also make a new post in the thread when a new release comes out.<br>
<br>
However, while releases are still coming fast and furious (as they are now) I'll try to remember to post dates in the initial post as well; once we get to a stable version I'll probably stop doing that, but for the moment it probably does make sense.</div>

</div>True.... but this sheet is designed to model sustained DPS.  It's true, in a 5 min fight, the activated trinkets will be a bit better than stated.  However, it's also true that in a 5 min fight, to get totally accurate answers, one would need to model the initial ramp-up of cycles and poison, which is probably a larger effect.  This sheet makes no effort to do so; it, like most spreadsheets of it's type, assumes that fights are going to be "long" - as in, of sufficient duration that such edge effects are negligible.  <br>
<br>
Besides which, fights significantly longer than 5 min are commonplace in the expansion; for instance, Hydross + Leotharas both run 8-10 min, and Tidewalker + Mag are even longer than that (my guild had one Tidewalker kill that ran almost 15 min).<br>
<br>
So, long story short?  Yes, for short fights the sheet is inaccurate - for reasons that go beyond the simple issues with activated trinkets - becase short fights is not what it's designed to model.</div>

<br>
I might be wrong, but that's at least what I've always held as the most optimal build. 40% chance to get an extra point isn't enough to rely on for cycles, and as combat daggers you use so few finishers that you don't really get a whole lot out of the talent.

		<div id="post_message_370277">If you're sustaining 5/5/3 without 2/3 ruthlessness, I'm impressed...<br>
<br>
Assuming no 2/5 Netherblade, a 5 pt SnD lasts 30.45 seconds, and a 3 point SnD lasts 21.75 seconds.  Thus the total SnD uptime is 52.2 seconds, in which time one needs to land 13 Backstabs (costing 780 energy) plus 10 extra energy (on average) for the 3-pt SnD.  Hence, to sustain 5/5/3 with no SnD downtime, one would need to generate 790 energy every 52.2 seconds, or roughly 15.1 energy per second.  Base regen is 10 energy per second (or 10.5 if you factor in AR, which you probably shouldn't given in the interest of measuring sustained cycles, but what the heck, I'll give it to you).  So that means combat potency would need to replenish 4.6 energy per second, which requires 1.54 offhand hits per second.  Due to the base 5% dodge rate, this means you need to launch 1.62 offhand attacks per second.<br>
<br>
The fastest possible dagger OH is 1.3 speed; to launch 1.62 OH attacks per second with such a weapon would require attacking at 2.11 times the normal speed.  SnD gives 1.3x, Blade Flurry (again, not really fair to include for sustained cycles, but whatever) gives 1.025x, and typical mongoose uptime for 2 weapons gives another (roughly) 1.02x.  Hence, one would need to get 55.5% haste from haste rating - also known as 584 haste rating.  Dragonspine and Thundering Skyfire together give maybe 200.  So unless there's some way to pick up 384 haste rating from gear, 5/5/3 is *not* sustainable without Ruthlessness - at least, not without dropping SnD uptime.  Hence, 2/3 Ruthlessness is required to allow 5/5/3 as a reasonable cycle.<br>
<br>
As for why not 3/3 - well, 2/3 *is* enough for 5/5/3, and getting 3/3 would require taking points out of Imp Backstab (bad), Relentless Strikes (worse), or Lethality... but since there's no cycles opened up by 3/3, I'd rather have the extra point in Lethality.</div>

So rather than have a spreadsheet for each individual fight and its peculiarities, you have one spreadsheet that gives a general answer, and you fill in the gaps of its scope with understanding.  We know Mut ramps up faster than Combat Daggers, so they're going to edge a little bit on a Maulgar fight, and absolutely dominate on something akin to the old Twin Emps fight, where it's all ramp up and then you're running around for a while.<br>

</div>
<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->So, an answer in a couple parts:<br>
<br>
Depending on your guild's strategy and luck, Magtheridon, Tidewalker, and Hydross are all decently approximated by 10 min uninterrupted dps.  Karathress is perhaps more accurately 4 fights each 2-3 min long, and Leotharas is just plain interrupted and spotty.  Void Reaver has frequent interruptions but said interruptions are fairly short.  And I haven't seen any of the other fights in the expansion yet - perhaps someone in a more advanced guild than I (koaschten, perhaps?) can comment on the nature of the later TK fights and/or Hyjal and Black Temple.<br>
<br>
So, while there are certainly some fights that are highly interrupted, there are also quite a few that aren't.  So a purely sustained model is somewhat reasonable for a nontrivial number of fights in the expansion.  Hence, the sustained model does have some value.<br>
<br>
Admittedly, however, it would be potentially worthwhile to deal with shorter and/or more interrupted fights than this spreadsheet is designed to handle.  To be perfectly honest, this is exactly the complaint I raised against the initial Rogue DPS spreadsheet when I first saw it - consider, for instance, the following statement by me in my guild forums, last October:<br>
<br>
<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->
<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px; ">
	<div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom:0px"><img src="citation.gif" border="0"></div>
	<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" border="0" width="100%">
	<tbody><tr>
		<td class="alt2" style="border:1px inset">
			
				...as near as I can tell, it's computing DPS in an abstracted situation that doesn't actually occur in any real fight. The assumptions about sustainability aren't even valid for Patchwerk, much less any other fight. It's calculating the numbers assuming, roughly speaking, a fight of infinite length against a stationary target with no tea use. Whereas in practice, the longest uninterrupted stationary fight we have is Patchwerk at 7 minutes, and that's short enough that the edge effects do matter. So, yes, as a theoretical exercise in damage computation, it's fine - but has nothing to do with any real situation, even neglecting the issues of stamina and survivability.
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>
<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->Now, looking back: 1) I was overstating the case slightly and 2) I think this is less true now than it was then, but I'm certainly willing to concede that it's a valid gripe.<br>
<br>
The problem is: computing anything else is a whole heck of a lot harder.  My solution to the problem then was to totally neglect any notion of cycles and just straight parse fights to figure out how often I was using each attack, and a parameter in the spreadsheet that allowed me to tweak this value to customize gear to each fight.  The problem is, many of the newer effects and abilities (notably, haste procs such as Mongoose/Dragonspine Trophy/Thundering Skyfire Diamond and energy procs like Combat Potency) just cannot be modeled through these approaches, because they fundamentally change the ratio of white to yellow attacks.  Hence, the approach of counting attacks just doesn't work - one actually needs to look at the attack order and cycles.  But to come up with general cycles - across a range of gear selection - for a fight only one or two minutes long, turns out to be extremely challenging.  And even if you figure it out for 1 min fights, you'd need to figure it out again for 2 min fights, and for 3 min fights, and for fights separated by 15 seconds, or 1 min, or 5 min.  And unless you do this all carefully and precisely, the answers you get aren't really going to be any better.<br>
<br>
Finally: even assuming I did know how to write a tool more specific to short fights, and that such a thing would be more accurate for significant numbers of fights, I'm honestly not sure if it's worth the effort.  This sheet is designed as a tool, not the ultimate answer to all questions rogue.  It will, in general terms, allow you to compare gear, and help you towards optomizing your DPS while maintaining survivability - but I make no claims that it's accurate to more than a couple AP-equivalent anyway.  For the general sorts of comparisons it's designed for (i.e. is it worth losing the WW 2/5 bonus to upgrade WW shoulders to Deathmantle) it's going to give answers that are just as helpful as the more focused tool.  And for the more subtle questions (which is better, Veteran's Musket or Prince Bow) where the answer is only 2-3 EAP apart, I wouldn't trust any spreadsheet to always get the answer right.<br>
<br>
So, stated briefly: while this sheet isn't a 100% accurate model of all possible cases, I believe it is sufficiently close to still be a useful tool - such that I don't think it warrants the (considerable) effort it would require to make a good interrupted-fight SS.</div>

We were unable to resolve all the issues with OO compatability, so as a quick fix I generated a second version of the sheet that works in OO (but not Excel).  Hence, there are two download links:<br>
<br>
Excel Version: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110810160038/http://www.savefile.com/files/772881" target="_blank">http://www.savefile.com/files/772881</a><br>

<br>
Changes:<br>
*Sheet now supports mixing weapons of different types (i.e. Sword MH and Dagger OH, or vice versa)<br>
*Socketing has been redone - this should resolve the issues with socketing in the previous verison.<br>
*More accurate model of Windfury added<br>
*Sword Spec adjusted to reflect the fact that Sword Spec hits are yellow attacks and cannot glance.<br>
*Assorted bugs in calculation sheets corrected.<br>
*"Optimal" and "Suggested Upgrade" columns should now give more accurate values.<br>
*New items added.<br>
*Thundering Skyfire Diamond updated to have a 40 sec internal cooldown; this is an approximate value until the behavior is totally modeled, but it more accurately reflects the power of the gem than did the old model.<br>
*Issue with enchants of the same name has been corrected.<br>
*Indicator of current hit rating and whether you are at the hit cap added to main page.<br>
*And probably some other stuff too - I don't recall everything that's been changed over the last couple weeks.</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->It was like this before the buff... Swords have been better since BC came out and 1.4-5 speed offhands fell into our laps.<br>
<br>
I don't think a 5% extra attack mechanic was developed with the idea of proccing from a weapon twice as slow in your main hand (with no offhand damage penalty.)<br>
Also, it's not completely accurate. We don't know if sword spec procs windfury, we don't know if it procs combat potency... We hardly know that sword spec doesn't proc off of itself.<br>
<br>
Really a strength of a combat swords build that I doubt even a handful of people have realized yet is how optimal the combo point generation is.<br>
<br>
With rupture becoming such an important and clear choice over eviscerate and combat potency changing cp generation drastically a few months ago, what has really changed?<br>
<br>
An ideal build will give just enough points to toss up a 5 point rupture just as the preceeding rupture falls off while having a hundred percent slice uptime. Now I think daggers are too slow and mutilate is too fast for this.<br>
<br>
Course that's just my speculation. Haven't done the math and could be wrong.</div>

		<div id="post_message_373234" class="post_message_underline">I've been messing around with the spreadsheet for quite a while now, and it's very nicely done. Couple little gripes I have with it however:<br>
<br>
First off I believe that because of the way in which hit was calculated it is slightly overvalued. You use a method of generating the dps gain form 1 hit rating by decreasing the hit value, which because of the semi-linear properties of +hit makes the calculations slightly off.<br>
<br>
Simple change for this would be to take the +13/205 off H35 and H31 and change H7 to read "=$B$7+1" Might be off as to your reasonings for doing this, but would make it a little more accurate.<br>
<br>
Second, I don't know why, but I can not get my AP to match up to my in game tab on the Dagger Calc sheet. Taking off all buffs form the sheet, and seeing that all gems/items/enchants are correct it still won't show my character sheet number. It's always lower than expected!<br>
<br>
One last thing to mention would be that each time you release a new sheet, I always add drop down boxes to the buff sheet to make it a little easier to use, as well as alternating lines of color to better choose between the buffs. Just little UI things that can make the sheet much more user friendly.<br>
<br>
Great job on it though, I love to see all the calculations out there to go over and examine! Keep up the awesome work!</div>

<br>
To LiteSabre, what stat balance are you using?  If you are using Total, agility and hit become so close in value (for a large chunk of gear) that the sheet will sometimes give what seem to be either conflicting or circular results.  I personally really only use the "offensive" setting, which gives no value to defensive stats like stamina.</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->"Optimal" doesn't refer to the best possible gear you could be wearing.  It refers to the best possible gemming/enchanting of what you are wearing.  The reason there is an "optimal hit" number is to warn you if the gem combination it's recommending excedes the hit cap (in which case it's wrong about what's optimal; it has no way of knowing about the hit cap, so will keep recommending hit gems no matter how much you have.  The general solution is to start replacing hit gems with agi gems relative to it's recommendation until you're under the hit cap.<br>
<br>
So, it's not asserting that 272 is the absolute maximum useful haste value; merely that with your current gear, the best possible socketing yields 272 hit rating.<br>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->Agreed; I found this to be true of the Rogue DPS spreadsheet as well.  I think it's in no small part due to the fact that swords just have access to vastly more efficient cycles; 5/5/3 is not a particularly good cycle, but it's the best that combat daggers can do; when you get to 5s/5r there's a signficant damage boost, and the ability to further drop the length of the SnD to compress the cycle even further just favors swords all the more.<br>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->Yes; the sheet currently assumes that sword spec can proc all the other proc effects you may have, which may or may not be accurate, and whether it's true or not would create a fairly large disparity in dps; rogue DPS is heavily influenced due to the large number of powerful procs available right now (Dragonspine, Mongoose, Poisons, etc.)<br>

</div>
<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->So, the reason why it's done the way it is is to prevent the value of hit rating from going to zero the moment you touch the hit cap; while it's true that the *incremental* value of hit goes to zero at that point, the value of the first 300 points shouldn't change; as such, I subtract the amount of hit granted by 1 hit rating after performing the floor of the the hit cap to ensure that a valid result is always obtained.<br>
<br>
In terms of whether it's less accurate: the only difference between what it's doing and what you recommend (assuming you're not at the hit cap) is that this way measures the damage lost by you hit going down by 1, and your way measures the damage gained by hit going up by 1; either is as accurate as the other.  In reality, we should be taking the derivative at the point itself rather than doing either, but since that's not practical, going one step in either direction is equally valid.<br>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->If you're refering to the stats at the top of the cacls page - that's honestly not *too* surprising to me.  The stats on the calc page are in some sense "raw stats" - they're not computed in quite the same way as the ones on your character sheet.  For instance, Agi and Sta don't factor in Vitality at the top; this it added further down the page.  AP includes a time-averaged portion of any activated AP effects such as Bloodlust Brooch.  I think there are a few other things like that as well.<br>
<br>
That said, it's also possible there's a bug; I'll look through it and see if I can find anything.  We already corrected a couple of issues that were causing stats to be added incorrectly in the last revision; it's entirely possible that we missed something so it's still a bit off.<br>

				Agreed; I found this to be true of the Rogue DPS spreadsheet as well. I think it's in no small part due to the fact that swords just have access to vastly more efficient cycles; 5/5/3 is not a particularly good cycle, but it's the best that combat daggers can do; when you get to 5s/5r there's a signficant damage boost, and the ability to further drop the length of the SnD to compress the cycle even further just favors swords all the more.

I prefer swords to be honest, but I'd always assumed that daggers had naturally higher DPS to make up for the awkwardness involving positioning, plus the other constraints both PVP-wise and energy cycle/rotation-wise.</div>

				So, the reason why it's done the way it is is to prevent the value of hit rating from going to zero the moment you touch the hit cap; while it's true that the *incremental* value of hit goes to zero at that point, the value of the first 300 points shouldn't change; as such, I subtract the amount of hit granted by 1 hit rating after performing the floor of the the hit cap to ensure that a valid result is always obtained.

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->Well interestingly enough... because there is no validation on the MH/OH miss chance not allowing it to go below 0, hit will still remain worth it's value over 308 with these changes.

		<div id="post_message_368392" class="post_message_underline">Yes, it currently pays no attention to the hit cap.  When I was writing the initial version, it kept confusing the heck out me that the value of a piece of gear would suddenly drop by a third the instant you hit the hit cap, which isn't an accurate assessment of the situation at all; the value of that piece of gear is as high as ever, it's just that the combination of gear you happen to be using has a little too much +hit on it.  So I specifically calculated the incremental value of hit in a way that ignores the hit cap entirely.<br>
<br>
The problem with this solution, of course, is that it'll keep recommending high hit items even after you're hit capped, so specific upgrades off whatever gear you happen to be wearing might not actually be upgrades due to the hit mechanics.  It's not clear to me if there's a better way of doing this in the end, since high hit items *are* good and *should* score highly - they just shouldn't be recommended as upgrades for people already at the hit cap. Unfortunately, I can't think of any good way of writing that into the spreadsheet.<br>
<br>
As a short term solution, we're planning on adding a message warning you when you're over the hit cap, so at least you're aware that there's an issue.</div>

		<div id="post_message_368394" class="post_message_underline" style="min-height: 183px;">A simple Solution might be to have an item value calculated with and without hit cap. That way you could have a simple if-statement to make decisions on the upgrade item part once you hit the hit-cap. You even could add a column to the spreadsheet showing value with and without hit taken into consideration.<br>

</div>Not really, no.  In addition to moving all the forumlas, you need to redefine the named ranges to include the new items.  Also, copying the forumlas straight over tends not to work exactly, since not all the formulas have dollar signs everywhere they're needed to make the formulas directly copy.<br>
<br>
Honestly, given the frequency with which new releases of the sheet are coming out right now, the recommended way of getting an item into the sheet is to post it in this thread, and I'll add it the next release (assuming it strikes me as worth adding, anyway - again, I'm trying to limit this to 5-man blues and up).</div>

<br>
But what i would appreciate most would be something showing hit-rating / hit% on the gear page or a piece of code preventing us going over 25.5% hit to make sure you dont waste itemvalue. Something like 2 value colums, so you can evalute when you hit the cap to drop a low value hit item and grap a high value hit item, exchanging the low value hit item with another high value no hit dps piece.<br>

		<div id="post_message_368424" class="post_message_underline">Okay - I'll make a point to add those next release.  I punched them into a copy of the sheet I have on hand, and as a short answer:<br>
<br>
Don Alejandro's is comperable to Belt of One Thousand Deaths<br>
Hyjal Rings, at least at the rep levels in Wowhead, aren't particularly interesting.<br>
Shadowmoon Destoyer's Drape and Telonicus's Pendant of Mayhem are the best available pieces for their slot that I've seen to date.<br>
Terrok's Might is crap.<br>
Leggings of Murderous Attempt are a slight dps upgrade over T5 and a significant sta downgrade, causing their composite score to be almost identical.<br>
<br>
As a tip: one thing that works well if you want to compare new pieces of gear is to replace one of the existing items in the sheet - just pick an item that there's no chance you're going to use, and overwrite the name + stats with the new gear.  I.e., if you want to add more items below the low end of the sheet, overwrite some of the high end items that you won't get to for a while; if you want to add more high-end items, ovewrite some of the low-end blues that are inferior to what you have.</div>

		<div id="post_message_375562"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Using the OpenOffice version of the spreadsheet and my current gear setup, I don't have this problem. I weight my gear Offensively and I have the Belt of Deep Shadow at +5.69.<br>
<br>
This actually brings me to question this.  Even with having weapon skill and it's benefits so up in the air would you rank the Belt of Deep Shadow over the Vashj belt?  Obviously at a point where the Belt of Deep Shadow puts you over the hit cap and some of it's +hit goes to waste the Vashj belt is superior, but even with that said, some other items could be switched around.<br>
<br>
Do you guys really rank the Belt of Deep Shadow above the Belt of One-Hundred Deaths?  When I use Pf's spreadsheet I see the Belt of One Hundred Deaths coming out about 4-5 DPS ahead and that is with the weapon skill post UNchecked.<br>
<br>
Here is what I've come up with based on my own numbers.  This is using my(<b>DISCLAIMER: The AEP used only applied to my current gear setup</b>) unbuffed AEP listed by pf's spreadsheet.  The only AEP ratio I use in this however is .58AP = 1AGI= 1AEP.  Stamina is ignored.<br>
<br>
Looking at just the Agility and AP on both of the belts:<br>
<br>
Agility first:<br>
Vashj: 29agi = 29AEP<br>
Crafted: 32agi = 32AEP<br>
 <br>
Attack Power:<br>
Vashj: 74AP *.58 = 42.92 AEP + 29AEP(listed above) = 71.92AEP<br>
Crafted: 66AP *.58 = 38.28 AEP + 32AEP(listed above) = 70.28AEP<br>
<br>
At this point, for my current gear setup, Vashj is slightly ahead.  Obviously this isn't the case for a lot of gear setups and doesn't take in account raid/buff scaling either.<br>
<br>
The socket bonuses are the same and I prefer the red and blue versus the 2 blue on the crafted.  So again, Vashj is slightly ahead with my current setup.<br>
<br>
Now for the +hit versus the +wep skill rating.<br>
<br>
+18hit gives roughly +1.141% hit (18/15.77)<br>
 <br>
So, +1.141% hit on the crafted belt.<br>
<br>
-------------------<br>
<br>
+25 Weapon skill rating translates in to roughly 6.3414 wep skill.<br>
<br>
+6.3414 wep skill with the most recent and basic (still data to be observed for this) understanding of weapon skill gives us something around:<br>
  +.63% hit<br>
  +.25% crit<br>
  -.25% dodge (or is it -.50%?)<br>
<br>
-------------------<br>
The +1.70 AEP that the Vashj belt was ahead previously can all be changed with different gear/raid buffs, etc and the socket colors will also change value as new gems come out.  Therefore, in my opinion, it comes down to comparing +1.14% hit and +.63% hit, +.25% crit, -.25% dodge(something you can only get from weapon skill and not taken away post hit cap)<br>
<br>
<br>
What do you guys think?  The main thing that makes me want to stick with Vashj is that there are benefits from the +wep skill rating that will not be removed post 308hit (wexp/precision).  Honestly, I think I might be a bit biased though, because I'm very hopeful toward weapon skill being worth a flip.<br>

</div>You've hit the nail on the head.  All values are done based on your current stats, so changing your gear will change the values.  For items tha are very close in value, the behavior you describe is expected.  I know this seems strange, but there really isn't a good way around it in spreadsheet form.  To go all the way we'd need to either use macros or just plain use a database (discussed around page 3).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>So, couple of points here:<br>
<br>
1) Due to the nature of procs and the like, I'm fairly certain that 1% hit is actually superior to 1% crit right now, and comperable to -dodge (slightly less since -dodge also effects yellow attacks, but that's a reasonably minor effect since a dodged yellow attack only costs you about 20% of the damage of the attack).  So you're comparing 1.14% hit to 1.13% of other mods - looks pretty even, to me.  Which, conveniently, is what the spreadsheet seems to be showing for most people - they're within a couple of AP.<br>
<br>
2) Any rogue that's looking to make this decision is in a position where they're starting to pick up Tier 5, which has very little +hit on it.  The rogues in my guild that have started to pick up T5 have found their hit drops considerably - one rogue in my guild was at 309 hit last week, and having picked up T5 shoulders + legs is down to 273, even after reshuffling some other gear to get more hit.  So I'm of the opinion that the hit cap is somewhat less of a concern for such rogues.<br>
<br>
3) On the other hand, we *don't* understand weapon skill very well, so it's entirely possible that the value of Vashj belt is higher than we are estimating.<br>
<br>
In the end, I would say: they're pretty comperable.  There's probably a slight argument to be made in favor of the Vashj belt, but it's very very close - once I got one, I wouldn't bother with getting the other until no one else needed it.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I'm not sure I agree with that.  I'm a rogue that is in a "position" to pick one up and the only immediate piece of t5 I'll be grabbing will be the gloves, which is a +hit upgrade.  According to both pf's and your spreadsheet the Stranger shoulders, which I currently use, rank higher than the t5 shoulders.  I'll be content with Brigand's BP over deathmantle as well.  I guess once I can get enough pieces to put together a 4pc I'll be taking a big loss in +hit, so I see your point there.<br>
<br>
Either way, I really wish we had some more data on +wep skill. Not knowing for sure the impact +wep skill makes bugs me.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_376175"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Stranger shoulders are better for dagger rogues, sure.  They *also* have no hit.<br>
<br>
I mean, I'm not saying that you can't still reach the hit cap in T5 - just that it's not quite so immediate a concern as it is for some less-geared rogues.  I mean, I could hit 350 hit without even resocketing anything with current gear, and could probably break 400 if I really wanted to - in fact, if I get the next couple of upgrades in the wrong order, I'm going to wind up in a situation where I'll be hard-pressed *not* to have 320+ hit rating.  At Karazhan/T4 levels of gear you have to work *not* to be hit-capped.  When you get up to T5 level itemization, this is less true, I think.  BBV has lots of hit, to be sure, but not a whole lot of other things do.  Given which, I think it's fair to say that the fact that Belt of Deep Shadow has hit rather than other mods is not a particularly large disadvantage.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

The fact that weapon skill allows you to get more hit on your gear is something that's not counted, and kind of a big deal. <br>

(If hit is worth .3 more ap than agi on your sheet then every point of hit the weapon skill allows you to get over the cap adds .3 more APEP to your weapon skill item.)

a) +skill converts dodges to misses, or<br>
b) +skill converts dodges to hits.<br>
<br>
In the first case, the weapon skill itself provides no benefit other than raising the hit cap, because dodges and misses both do no damage.  Hence no damage is directly added, but an equal amount of value is gained by raising the hit cap.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, in the 2nd case, the weapon skill provides no benefit to the hit cap, but adds damage directly<br>
<br>
Either way, it's modeled.  Personally, I'd be willing to bet that it converts dodges to hits, because that fits better with the understood mechanics.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Fair enough about Stealther's Helmet and I understand why you'd want to keep the blue items at a minimum. Thing with the Assassination set though is it's probably the most common blue items people have for the slots when starting to raid. My guild is currently in SSC and all our rogues still have at least one piece of Assa set or the Stealther's helm (new metagems are nice but on the other hand  they seem a waste to put on something you're planning to replace as a priority). Due to being quite rogue heavy and unlucky with drops, I guess.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Would re-gemming my gear according to the "Optimal Hit" would actually give me the best dps in theory?<br>

"Optimal Hit" != "0% miss for boss mobs"?<br>

EDIT: Well yeah because I put my gear into the spreadsheet and it tells me my optimal hit is 227, but I already have 256(and I was still aiming to get more &gt;.&gt;), so I'm confused right now to whether re-gem to lower hit or...?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Given that, the sheet tells me that I should go from my 308 hit down to 252 by replacing every Rigid Dawnstone with a Bright Living Ruby because the Dawnstone is currenly worth 15.24 APE vs. the Ruby's 16 APE.

</div>The problem here is that the AP values of the gems are based off of your current total stats.  All the sheet is telling you is that you have geared your hit beyond the point where 1 HR is better than 2 AP, given your resulting total AP.<br>
<br>
As soon as you change *one* Rigid Dawnstone to a bright ruby, the value of every rigid dawnstone will rise to more than 15.24.<br>
<br>
If you just replace them one at a time, and watch the value of rigid dawnstone each time you switch one, you should reach a point where rigid dawnstone is almost exactly 16.  That's where you stop.<br>
<br>
If you replace them all, you will probably see it recommending that you change them back, because a Rigid Dawnstone will be worth more than 16 AP at that point.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Sure, it might only be the difference of a 7 APE change if I did it, but at this point a Netherblade Chestpiece is a 7 APE upgrade for me.

</div>Yeah, that through me off a bit at first - we're looking into a way to fix it.  We decided not to worry about it for the initial release since, as you say, it's not so much a bug as a slightly confusing display issue, and we felt that it was better to get the zone filters out so people could play with them and give feedback rather than waiting a couple days until we'd fixed that.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I had glanced at the Buffs page, but it might have been scrolled over because I didn't see the yes/no column that I see now, playing with the buffs I can see that the value of hit changes favorably with pretty standard melee buffs.  I do realize that when unbuffed the hit rating is marginally less useful, but I gear to raid (as most of us do).<br>

</div>Understandable and good idea, but not including Assassin set seems a bit weird as pretty much every rogue will put alot of effort ino getting those pre-karazan. Sure, the smart ones will just buy Fel Leather but they don't know that unless you put it in here, right? <br>
<br>
And Band of Exorcist is one of those items that's so good compared to it's level and how easy it is to get it would be a shame not to include.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Optimal Hit reflects the amount of hit rating if you socketed and enchanted your current gear optimally.  For exactly what is considered to be optimal for you, consult the middle gear column.  So, yes, given the buffs you have selected and the gear you have equipped, the spreadsheet feels you would do more damage by gemming for less hit.<br>
<br>
Optimal Hit *doesn't* have anything to do with the hit cap - is just an indication of how much hit you'd have if you socketed according to the recommendations in the middle column.  This is primarily intended as a warning mechanism, as, in general, "optimal" involves socketing stuff with a whole lot of +8 hit gems, which will frequently put you over the hit cap - the Optimal Hit number is designed to warn you about this so you know not to socket so overwhelmingly with hit.</div>

</div>Might I also ask that you include what color slots a certain type of armor has? e.g. (Netherblade Facemask, 1M 1R).<br>
<br>
<br>
Or maybe color the cells according to the color of the gems, if it's not too troublesome.<br>
<br>
Well, more like a GUI update though. <br>
<br>
<br>
On the other hand, is it possible that you make a warning or some sort when you change a gem and will result in deactivating your current meta gem? And also take into account the meta gem requirements for recommended gems. <br>
<br>
Thanks alot for the work both of you have put in, it's a great spreadsheet ;P<br>

		<div id="post_message_381656"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I'll admit, I don't totally understand all the math going on here.  I just started using the spreadsheet and read going back to read the initial posts.

<br>
I've been trying to do some DPS comparisons vs. Drape of the Dark Reavers, trying to figure out how good static haste rating is (even on a blue item).  I decided to go all out and get +haste to gloves, giving me a 36 static haste rating w/o BT gear (which I believe is as high as it can get without DM Libram enchants).  <br>
<br>
Anyway, I haven't noticed any huge jump in DPS and was wondering if anyone else is doing testing.  I'm combat daggers so I hardly notice -.06 m-h swing speed and -.05 o-h.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>They're on the list of things to be added.  The difficulty is that, as unique gems, they can't be included in the normal gem lists - it is unhelpful if the spreadsheet recommends socketing everything with a gem that you can only have one of.  As such, we would like to leave them as an option for socketing pieces of gear, but we need to adjust the gem model before such a thing is possible.<br>
<br>
Similarly, the epic gems from BT will need to be added at some point, but, again, we need to work on how to do so intelligently.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
Attack cycles are actually one of the most important parts of playing a rogue.  While they seem simple at first, getting one to actually run smoothly in an encounter is pretty tough and can require a lot of concentration and last second decisions.  <br>
<br>
Attack cycles look like: ax/by/cz  where x,y,z are finishing moves and a,b,c are numbers.  This is because the combo point building moves really don't change within a build.  With the exception of using shiv (typically a no-no in raids) you'll be using either sinister strike, backstab, or mutilate to build combo points.  What you do with them matters.<br>
<br>
Slice and dice is your biggest dps finishing move as it increases your white attack speed by 30% (and combo point generation if you're combat specced).  Common cycles will look like:<br>
3s/5s/5r.  What this says is you should be able to throw a 3 points slice and dice, then a 5 point slice and dice, followed by a 5 point rupture and still have time to get 3 combo points back for another 3 point slice and dice.  This cycle keeps slice and dice up at all times and uses rupture.  Because of the slow combo point generation of daggers, this is a common cycle for combat daggers.<br>
<br>
If you look at the opposite end of the combo point spectrum you'll see mutilate, which generates enough points for cycles like 4+s/4+r/4+x  which means you use 4 or more points (depending on seal of fate crits) for a slice and dice and then you should have enough time for 2 more finishers (both with 4+ points) before you need to renew slice and dice.<br>
<br>
With the 2-piece set bonus on rogue's tier 4 gear a wrench was thrown in the cycle gears, with 3 extra seconds on a slice and dice, new cycles were possible.  Right now you'll see cycles like 1s/5r for swords, saying that you should be able to generate 6 combo points within 1 talented slice and dice with 2 pieces of tier 4 (this is theoretically possible without the 2 piece bonus with good combat potency procs, but the bonus helps).<br>
<br>
I hope that wall of text cleared things up.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>At the beginning of a fight definitly not, spamming Feint is neither powerful enough, nor does it help your dps. But a decent time into a fight you can Vanish to reset your Aggro and go "All Out". Usually that will be a big enough buffer for you to not reach the Tanks Aggro until either your Vanish is up again or the boss is dead. This holds true for DPS Values around 1200-1400 though. I yet have to find the optimal environment (Boss, party makeup, GEAR etc) though and consider the DPS of 2100 highly theoritcally.<br>

		<div id="post_message_382450"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->So, the problem in a nutshell:<br>
<br>
Right now there is only one list of gems; both gem selections and gem recommendations are drawn from that list.<br>
<br>
In order to handle unique gems, you would need to have two lists of gems: a list of which gems can be selected by the user while inputting their gear, and a list of which gems can be used by the spreadsheet while making socketing recommendations.<br>
<br>
This isn't necessarily a hugely hard change to make, but it will take some time, and we've been working on other things.  I think it's getting towards the top of the stack, though.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I'll admit, I don't totally understand all the math going on here.  I just started using the spreadsheet and read going back to read the initial posts.  With all the mention of how powerful +haste is/could be, how does <a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32665" target="_blank">http://www.wowhead.com/?item=32665</a> fit in compared to epic pre-BT/Hyjal gear?<br>
<br>
I've been trying to do some DPS comparisons vs. Drape of the Dark Reavers, trying to figure out how good static haste rating is (even on a blue item).  I decided to go all out and get +haste to gloves, giving me a 36 static haste rating w/o BT gear (which I believe is as high as it can get without DM Libram enchants).  <br>
<br>
Anyway, I haven't noticed any huge jump in DPS and was wondering if anyone else is doing testing.  I'm combat daggers so I hardly notice -.06 m-h swing speed and -.05 o-h.</div>

</div>Using the older "Rogue DPS" spreadsheet, the Drape of the DR comes out ahead of everything by a good margin until you can kill Kael'Thas.  Since Aran has been stingy, I've been using the Cloak of the Craft (world drop BoE, 13 hit rating) for a long time.  The Crystalweave is a slight bit better than this, and the Vengeance Wrap with a Glinting Noble Topaz socketed is slightly better still.

</div>I think that this is mostly because the Drape of the DR is one of the few epic cloaks with +hit on it. If you're already reaching the hit cap via your other slots, the Drape's relative advantage over other cloaks is diminished or eliminated altogether. (Of course, having the Drape would allow you to reslot a few gem sockets to replace +hit with Agi or AP, but you know what I mean.)<br>
<br>
The Shade hasn't been kind in dropping the cloak for me in 15 or more kills so far, but I'm only one Romulo's Poison Vial away from reaching the hit cap without it so I may just have to buy the Blood Knight War Cloak or something if we stop running Kara before the Drape drops for me.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_392087"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I have been using the spreadsheet for a while and found it helpful. Now that arena 2 gear is coming I wanted to find out if to get the shiv or OH mace to supplement my Dragonmaw. I tried the spreadsheet and found that the mace gave me around +5dps and the shiv almost +20dps. As a second opinion is always nice I went to Foreshadows dps calulator (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080730061512/http://www.pvp.net.tf/" target="_blank">http://www.pvp.net.tf/</a>) and checked there. The result was that the two weapons were basically equal in damage output (OH mace was a fraction better).<br>
<br>
So which one is more correct and why is the other incorrect? Its a bit disturbing to find such a difference between two dps calculators and I do not know which weapon to choose now...<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>It's true.  Except that:<br>
<br>
1) Most raiding rogues have at least 200 hit rating.  Many have 300.  Either way, the difference in actual miss chance is perhaps another 6% - meaning the damage difference is 1% instead of .5%.  Not a large effect.<br>
<br>
2) The combat potency thing was never modeled in the first place, and is similarly a small effect anyway; it increases your combat potency procs by 5%, which works out to roughly 10 energy a minute, or about 6 dps.  Again, not a large effect.<br>
<br>
3) Even with Sword Spec proccing WSC, 75% or more of the procs are from Sinister Strikes.  Thus, the time between cooldown ending and the next proc occurring will increase about 30%... but since that time is significantly less than the cooldown, we find that the actual increase in uptime is minimal.  Moreover, WSC isn't a particularly good trinket in the first place.  So an already-mediocre trinket received an almost-trivial nerf.  Also not a huge concern.<br>
<br>
All in all?  Depending on your gear, the sword spec change might lower your damage output a bit - maybe 20 DPS.  Is this totally negligible?  Of course not.  But given that we're seeing differences of up to several hundred dps between swords and daggers, in no way does this "definitly bring the sword-combat dps down and in-line again with dagger-combat" as was asserted.  Swords are still a lot better.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_417359"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I know that including fists and maces is a low priority atm and personally I agree with this, no reason to spend time researching cleary inferior specs (unless they buff the rod). There is perhaps one notable exception however, using mh fist and oh sword. With both weapon specs the only dps talents you're giving up is maybe a couple points in vile poisons. I don't expect this combo to beat sword+sword but it would be interesting to see how close it is, the slightly higher yellow damage has some merit in certain fights. I know there's not a huge amount of fists available, al'ars and the bladefist are pretty rare, but BBWP and ofc S2 mh are quite common.<br>
<br>
This is entirely self-serving ofc since I just got al'ars mh fist (morogrim is being very stingy) but would it be possible to add these few mh fists to the sheet and assume fist spec when they're equipped, or would it be a lot of work?<br>
<br>
I've also heard that the bladefist procs quite a lot, has anyone done any testing on this? Did a quick search on these forums but didn't find anything.<br>
<br>
On a different note, one small addition I would like to see in the sheet is some kind of total defensive value of your gear for comparisons. Something like the rough dps estimate so that you can track both offense and defense when changing several items and gems. I find that I'm often not comparing one piece of gear with another directly but rather one set of gear/bonuses/gems with another set. If one piece is changed several others may need to be changed as well due to set bonuses and the hit cap. Having the rough dps visible makes these comparisons a lot easier but the defensive changes have to be added by hand currently. Also a way to easily change the defensive weighting would be nice but that's been mentioned before.<br>
<br>
Anyway thanks for all the work you guys are putting into this excellent sheet.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Daemona's already alluded to it - but it's kind of a funny case.<br>
<br>
As the high end of gear stands at the moment there are lots of haste options out there (mongoose/trinkets/slayer's bonus etc.) So you end up getting more worth from 15agility as a dmg component that scales with the rest of your haste.<br>
<br>
I played around on the spreadsheets and even when I removed all haste bonuses I couldn't get 10 haste above 15agility.  The crit component scales with gear too, apparently at the same rate as 10haste.  What you really need is something that boosts white dmg alone (like the old weapon skill) to push haste above agility.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I'm not fully understanding what bearing other haste factors have on the 10 haste rating itself, maybe I'm unfamiliar with the whole mechanic.<br>

I'd assume that you mean, haste rating is additive with those other factors, in-turn, it is not as valuble. Is that what you were eluding to?<br>

So it would be safe to say assuming the 1% increase in white DPS via the enchant, is incorrect?<br>

		<div id="post_message_420480"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Well, I'm back from vacation, so development can now resume.  As brief comments to the posts in the last week:<br>
<br>
Re: Modeling haste enchants.  Well, the incremental value of haste is computed on the sword/dagger calc sheets, so a direct comparison is possible.  Increasing white damage by .95%, on the other hand, does not give accurate values.  Regardless, when I actually punched everything in, I found that end BT gear + full raid buffs + consumables would put haste to gloves just barely ahead of agi, but anything less than that came up short.<br>
<br>
Re: Adding other weapon options.  I actually have good news on this front.  While on vacation I was thinking about the spreadsheet some (specifically, the question of how to do adjustable dagger cycles) and, while so doing, I came up with an approach that, in addition to getting adjustable dagger cycles, *should* also make it practical to add maces and fists as options.  So I'm hopeful that I will be able to add those in the next major revision.  As doing so involves a complete overhaul of the calculation pages, it will probably take me a couple weeks - I'm aiming for the end of July, but don't hold me to that.<br>
<br>
Re: Haste stacking.  SnD, BF, and Mongoose are all percentage based, and applied independantly.  I believe Heroism is as well, but I haven't checked, honestly.  All haste rating items add together and are then applied.<br>
<br>
So, for instance, if you have SnD, BF, 2xMongoose, and DST all up at the same time, the actual attack speed increase is 1.3x1.2x1.02x1.02x1.3091.<br>
<br>
A 1% speed increase thus does not equate directly to a 1% increase in white damage, both for reasons of the mechanics of stacking, as well the effects on procs.<br>
<br>
Edit: Oh, and Re: racial abilities.  Good call.  I'll get the human racial in the next revision - other abilities (berserking, etc.) will have to wait, but that ones simple to add so I will toss it in.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>The way the calc sheets currently work is that column B of each contains a computation of how much damage you do with the gear you have selected, and then columns C through whatever repeat that calculation with 1 more strength, 1 more agi, and so on.  So the "next stat" values are the last row in the calc sheets at the moment.<br>
<br>
However, this will be changing in 0.7; I'm going to be replacing the Sword and Dagger calc pages with a set of 7 new sheets, which will have the following effects:<br>
<br>
a) adjustable dagger cycles<br>
b) allow additional weapon types<br>
c) ease the restrictions on talent selection<br>
d) create a much more readable location for the next-stat info.<br>
<br>
At the moment I'm still catching up on things after my vacation, so I haven't done a whole lot of work on these changes yet, but I hope to have more time to work on them next week.<br>
<br>
As for adding gems: my understanding is that it's a bit painful, although honestly Darlal did most of the work on that part of the sheet so I don't know for sure.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Now I'm struggling to find out what to think of armour reduction in a raid situation. Your sheet gives me a rough DPS value of 1500 while in the real world I average about 1300. I suppose the difference can be accounted to the amount of armour that is assumed in the sheet. I'd love to fiddle around with this value, but I failed at Excel and wasn't able to find the relevant cells.<br>

		<div id="post_message_431853"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I've been working on the new calculation sheets for a bit, and while so doing it occurred to me that it would really be nice to get the correct values for some of the proc effects built into the sheet on one of these iterations.  In particular, I'd like to get the values of haste effects entered correctly, because they're a pain to change later.  So if any of you are feeling bored and would like to help out, it would be nice if people could take some data sets on the proc rates of various items, most notably Dragonspine Trophy, although the Blacksmithing maces, The Bladefist, and other weapons with haste procs would be helpful as well.<br>

		<div id="post_message_438343"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->If you could revise your original post to reflect all the work that has been done (which is great!) that would be really helpful.  Along these lines, you still have the link for the very first version in the original post.  You also have the newest versions at the top, but there's not really any reason to keep the link to the old version and if you read through the post and come across the link in the body of the text it seems like it is the most up to date spreadsheet, which it is not.<br>
<br>
Thanks for all the work on this.  I was using the rogue DPS sheet for gear choices as well and was confused as to why it wasn't suggesting +8 hit gems when I am not at the hit cap<br>
<br>
I also have a couple of questions.  <br>
<br>
First, I'm human and using swords but when I switch back and forth between human and NE the current hit value doesn't change.  Does the spreadsheet take into account the human racial bonus to sword skill?  <br>
<br>
Second, how is optimal hit calculated?  In particular it's saying that my current hit is 235 and my optimal is 251.  To the best of my knowledge neither 235 nor 215 is hit capped even with the human racial and using swords with Latro's as an offhand. So shouldn't my optimal hit be whatever the cap is-294?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_442791"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->It's sort of a combination of things that are holding up the show at this point.<br>
<br>
1) Mechanics testing.  For the most part, this is in decent shape; I was waiting on this for a while, but at this point I'm mostly at the point where I'm either going to take my best guess or leave out the offending piece of gear for the moment... and mostly the former, probably, given that testing so far has led me to the following rule of thumb:<br>
<br>
<i>All weapon procs are probably 1PPM in absence of significant evidence to the contrary</i><br>
<br>
So, for things that haven't been tested yet (Siphon of the Nathrezim and Blacksmithing Hammers, for instance) I'll probably just fill in 1 PPM for now and will change it later if necessary.<br>
<br>
The only outstanding thing here that I'm at all concerned about is the T5 4/5 proc rate.  This turns out to be sort of a difficult effect to model, and I really have no good data on what the answer might be.  The limited testing I've seen so far makes it appear that the answer is most likely not 1 PPM, so I don't have a good feeling on what to plug in as an estimate.  Still, this by itself wouldn't be holding me up - I'd just take my best guess and move on.<br>
<br>
2) The new calc sheets are a slightly larger job that I originally estimated - there are a few subtleties to implementing them that I didn't initially appreciate, and the planned number of sheets has increased from 7 to 11 (of which 5 are mostly complete, all of which are significantly larger than either calculation sheet in 0.6.3).  So they're taking a bit more time than I originally expected.<br>
<br>
3) The other thing holding up the show at the moment is a sort of communications mixup between Darlal and myself.  In order to support the underlying mechanic changes, there are some UI improvements that need to be made; additionally, there are some general UI improvements that would nice to have made at some point (for instance, the unique gem issue).  He and I discussed these about 2 weeks ago, and he indicated that he thought he might have time to make at least some of them... and I haven't heard from him since.  I guess he got busy with work or whatever.  Now, normally, this wouldn't be a problem; I'd just take a day or two, figure out how to do the UI stuff myself, and plow forwards.  What I'm concerned about, though, is the possibility that he might have started work on some of the more sophisticated changes; if I make the basic changes and then pound out 0.7 based on that + the new calculation sheets, and then he shows up with a version with all sorts of neat UI fixes... we have sort of a problem in terms of merging two fairly sophisticated sets of changes back into one sheet.  So I sort of hate to move forwards until I know what his status is.<br>
<br>
Anyway: I haven't forgotten about this sheet, and I am still working on it, but I don't really have a good time estimate as to when everything will be done.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_443081"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->WWS parses will perhaps helps some, but the fact that you're using two weapons of different speeds makes it hard to draw conclusions.  It's useful for generating ballpark figures but you can't really do statistics to know how good your answer is.<br>
<br>
In general, the most useful data collection for testing proc rates is a reasonably long (1k+ attacks, and more is better) period of attacks performed either with a single weapon or with two weapons of the same speed.  Using combo point generating moves is fine, but avoid finishing moves (as I have a sneaking suspicion that finishers might obey slightly unusual proc rules).<br>
<br>
When testing proc buffs (such as Coup De Grace) it is advantageous to use a buff-canceling macro like the one listed in the mechanics testing thread.  This isn't essential, but it's defenitely helpful.<br>
<br>
I generally like to see a combatlog of such data, but if you use a buff-canceling macro the following are sufficient:<br>
<br>
1) How many attacks, including specials, did you land on the target?<br>
2) How many procs occurred?<br>
3) What is the shortest period of time between consecutive procs?<br>
<br>
If you don't use a canceling macro, a combatlog is sort of necessary to analyze for overlapping procs.<br>
<br>
To accurately pin down the proc rate of an effect requires two such data sets performed with different weapon speeds, and the more different the better; for instance, take a data set with a 1.3 speed weapon, and then another with a 2.6 speed weapon.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_443155"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Just as a quick note, there are some buffs that can't be cancelled with that Macro. For instance, the proc on the Blackout can't be cancelled. I found out a few days ago, that mongoose can't be cancelled either. So just keep that in mind. <br>
<br>
I would suggest trying to manually trying to cancel the buff at first to see if it can be done before you go cursing the macro for not working .<br>

		<div id="post_message_447877"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I worked on the sheet a bunch over the weekend, and finally have it up and running on the new calculations sheets.  I haven't had a chance to make all the other changes I'd like to make, but never fear - I do plan to work on them over the next week or two.  However, before I took the time to implement all the suggestions, ideas, and other features people have had, I wanted to make the new calculation sheet available, so as to allow you fine folks to start playing with it and finding any mistakes I might have made (as, while I tried to be careful, it is highly probably that I missed something at some point).<br>
<br>
So, anyway: version 0.7 is now available at the links below, but be aware that it's perhaps a bit buggy in spots.  If you find anything that doesn't make sense/doesn't match your expectations from the prior version/whatever, let me know.<br>

Known Issues:<br>
* Defensive contribution of Mongoose is totally neglected.<br>
* Sheet does not include the latest weapon-skill findings; hence, if you operate with less than 5 weapon skill, your damage values will be incorrect.<br>
<br>
Stuff planned to be added soon:<br>
* Maces and fist weapons.<br>
* User-edittable interface for offense/defense weighting, mob armor, mob resist rate, and similar parameters.<br>
* More descriptive gem names<br>
* Possibly BT and Unique gems, assuming I can find a way to implement them.<br>
* Any other comments in the last 5 pages or so - I'll look through them at some point and add what I feel is worth adding.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_447988"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->That's actually an intentional change and not a bug.  I introduced a new way of computing the damage done by PPM procs which will be more accurate than the old way.  What's encoded on Trinket sheet is that it procs for 277 damage per minute (i.e. 1 PPM at 277 damage per proc).  It then evaluates the value based on the columns Q and R of the DamageCalcs page, which compute the incremental value of a 1 damage per minute proc.  So while the computation is done a bit differently than in prior versions, the overall value of the trinket should be about the same in 0.6.3 and 0.7 - which is true, at least, in my working copy of the sheet.<br>
<br>
<b>Edit:<br>
<br>
My apologies, there is actually a bug there - I failed to totally switch things over to the new calculation method.  I'll post a fix in a few minutes.</b><br>
<br>
Before anyone brings them up, the following are also not bugs:<br>
<br>
1) Dragonspine Trophy scores even higher than it did before.  It does so since I updated the proc rate to match the newest data on it's proc rate.<br>
<br>
2) Windfury is a smaller damage boost than it was before.  Again, intentional.  Done to match the hotfix to Windfury.<br>
<br>
3) Daggers do somewhat more damage than previously.  Again, intentional.  It's much smarter about computing dagger cycles than it used to be.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_448112"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Ald, I wonder if it would be possible for you to easily add support for fist weapons. They are equivalent to swords in most respects, with the difference being 5% crit instead of extra attacks. Additionally, I wonder if you might be able to support the mixed sword/fist spec I -- and other rogues who may have had shitty main hand sword drop luck -- use.<br>
<br>
It's a lot to ask, but you make quite an enticing tool here, and I'd like to be able to use it effectively without needing to worry about whether the values it gives are accurate for me. :-P<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Each of the calc sheets named after a cycle computes the damage for the named cycle.  It does so by computing the "best" cycle of that form.  Best is somewhat of a loose term, though, in that there will be situations where, for instance, the Xs5r cycle does not compute the highest-damage cycle of that form.  However, the set of 6 sheets working in concert *should* between them work out what the best possible cycle is for a given gear setup (more on this later).  This where the DamageCalcs page comes in; for each combination of stats, it computes the maximum possible damage across all 6 pages, and uses this to value the stats.<br>
<br>
To see what value of X is actually being used, consult line 300 of 5sXr and 1sXr, line 293 of Xs5r and Xs3r, or line 310 of 5sXr3s.<br>
<br>
So, for instance, with my current gear filled in, the value of 5sXr.B300 is 5, which means that that sheet is computing my damage for the cycle 5s5r.  1sXr.B300, however, is 3.73, which means that it's computing damage for the cycle 1s3.73r.<br>
<br>
Now, obviously, there's no such thing is a 3.73 point rupture; in reality, you'd have to use either 3 or 4 point ruptures.  However, quantizing cycles to whole numbers would cause discontinuities in the value of stats, which strikes me as bad on the whole; the purpose of the sheet is not to be a 100% accurate damage calculator (although, I like to think it's pretty good).  The purpose of the sheet is to get good values for all the stats, and using continuous values for the cycles helps quite a bit with that.<br>
<br>
Anyway: 5sXr, 1sXr, and 5sXr3s all attempt to find the largest rupture you can work into the cycle while maintaining 100% SnD uptime.  This should always be the highest damage cycle available.  Note that all ruptures are forced to be at least 3-point ruptures, as the damage dropoff from 3 to 2 is considerable so it's unlikely that a smaller rupture will ever make sense.<br>
<br>
Xs5r and Xs3r, on the other hand, compute the smallest possible SnD that will allow the cycle to be sustained.  This is *usually* the highest-damage cycle of that form, but it is possible to come up with situations where it's not.  However, it can be shown that in situations where it's *not* optimal, a 5 point SnD is. So, for instance, Xs5r.B293 for my current gear is 3.14.  So it's probably the case that 3.14s5r is my best cycle.  However, it's also possible that 5s5r might be better.  Fortunately, as noted above, 5sXr is computing *that* possibility, so in general one or the other of those should give the best possible cycle of the form Xs5r.<br>
<br>
Long story short: for a given level of energy regen there are 3 cycles of the form XsYr that might be optimal.  Between the 4 sheets of that form, all 3 possibilities are covered, so between them the optimal cycle should always be computed.  5sXr3s and 5s are tacked on for those cases where energy regen is insufficient to sustain even 5s3r.  So, in general, these combinations should always give your best dps option.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I know your working hard on a lot of things for this spreadsheet, is there any plans to include fists in a later release? I like this sheet better then the dps spreadsheet, as values seem more realistic. The only thing it seems to be missing is being able to look at specs such as combat fists, and the fist MH sword OH combo. Although i think i already know the answer to which spec is best, its a good source to be able to show other rogues in my guild.</div>

		<div id="post_message_449948"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->0.7.2 is up, with the long-awaited mace and fist support.  I also added in a few other raid drops that had been missing.  Still not included are Band of the Eternal Champion and Madness of the Betrayer; without knowing the proc rate, there's not a lot of sense to including them.  So if someone has them and would like to get me some proc rate data, I will happily add them.<br>
<br>
Since these changes required a fair amount of fiddling with the gear recommendation pages, I decided to post this so people can help work out the bugs; the assorted more minor changes (such as more descriptive gem names and the like) I will add over the next week or two.<br>

Edit: A few bugs, When i put on the WW chest, one of the gem slots vanish. It still counts the gem, but doesn't show it. It seems like the trinket rankings may be a little off also. WSC is ranked at the same level as the DFT.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_450112"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Regarding the WW Chest thing: fairly simple bug, but as it's purely a display issue I'm not going to bother rereleasing until I fix a few more bugs.<br>
<br>
Regarding trinkets: in my copy of the sheet I show WSC ranked appropriately - with my gear (i.e., what the sheet is first downloaded with) I show WSC at 165, a bit ahead of Tsunami (154) and well ahead of DFT (112).  If you could send me your gear/spec (or email me a copy of the sheet with your stuff filled in) that would help me with diagnosing it.<br>
<br>
Speaking of bugs: I just realized I made a mistake with adding the new maces/fists; while the scoring for all of them is correct, the actual DPS number reported with Syphon, Rod of the Sun King, Dragonstrike, Dragonmaw, or The Bladefist equipped will be incorrect.  I'll fix it later tonight, or perhaps tomorrow.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_450714"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->On the regular rogue forums it appears to be blasphemy to suggest that fist spec with a dagger OH could rival pure sword spec using dual swords for pve DPS. However, it does appear to me from the spreadsheet that fist/dagger and an identical talent spec (20/41 with 4 points in Imp Poisons) OTHER than in relation to weapon specialisation results in fist/dagger coming out at pretty much exactly the same DPS as sword/sword (sometimes a little more - sometimes a little less depending on gear). <br>
<br>
I think what happens is that as one's gear gets towards the top end and if you factor in raid buffs swords come out more favourably - but towards the middle to lower end fists are better. It seems to me that gear placing you at around the 750 DPS unbuffed mark with 308+hit (that is with boss mob armour on) yeilds more from fist/dagger but as you go above that swords move incrementally ahead (raid buffed on 750 base results in about 1170 with the most common buffs and swords are a mere 5.5 DPS ahead then).<br>
<br>
Can this be right? Does the spreadsheet factor in the benefits of sword spec fully? It has been pointed out (somewhat bluntly) to me that swords are just plain better full stop but as far as i can see (a) they are not better in the low - mid range of gear - they are worse (b) they are only very fractionally better using insanely good gear. Keeping in mind fists give +crit for better pvp viability and burst i've concluded that fist/dagger is pretty nice. <br>
<br>
Finally - a lot of people mention dual specialisation fist/sword but it has become apparent to me that you are better off avoiding double specialisation and putting the extra points into poisons.........but the point of this post really is to ask if the spreadsheet factors in the benefits of sword spec in a way that people recognise to truly reflect the benefits of that spec.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>There are a couple reasons I decided to make this sheet.  <br>
<br>
First, I've never been particularly impressed with the accuracy of the other sheet.  Dating back to when I first hit level 60 I preferred to use my own calculations than rely on other people's, and the other sheet was no exception.  This became even more true when the expansion came out and some of the effects just plain couldn't be modeled accurately by the other sheet.  So, one of the ways this sheet is differentiated is that it is (in my opinion, at least) vastly more accurate.  <br>
<br>
Second, at the time I started work on this sheet, the Rogue DPS sheet had basically no provision for comparing gear whatsoever.  All it had was a little next-stat block buried in one of the middle sheets, which was even less accurate than the rest of the sheet was.  It is my understanding that they have since improved this somewhat, but most of those features arose after the creation of this sheet.  And, it might be noted, the solutions applied for those fixes only work in Excel; for people who use OpenOffice (such as myself on my home computer) the other sheet is totally worthless.<br>
<br>
In general, my main characterization of the other sheet is that it has gotten bogged down with a lot of unnecessary features and gismos and doodads, which interfere with it's core usability.  Fundamentally, it's still a DPS sheet with gear comparisons tacked on, and it shows. This aspires to be a really elegant sheet for gear comparisons, that happens to include a pretty decent damage calculator.  So if you're attempting to decide between a couple of different specs, you may find the other sheet to be more usable (although not necessarily more accurate); however, if you've already decided on roughly what spec you're interested in (which is fairly straightforward, given than there's only about 4 fundamentally different specs worth using as a raiding rogue) and are trying to figure out what gear upgrades to focus on and in what order - this sheet is miles ahead of the other, in my opinion.<br>

	</tbody></table>
</div>It's on my to-do list for this sheet (along with half a dozen other things).  Fortunately, it seems to be one of the easier changes to make - it's the unique gems that are going to be harder.  I'll probably try to push out a version with the epic gems and other easy fixes sometime this weekend.<br>

</div>Not easily, alas.  I mean, the fundamental problem is as follows.  You have a set of gear, which has a dozen gem sockets in it.   2 of these gem sockets need to be changed to blue gems to activate the metagem.  How do you know which 2 to change?  It's a reasonably easy thing to figure out as a human (the two that activate the most powerful set bonuses, basically).  But it's sort of hard to define in a general way in a spreadsheet.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">On the regular rogue forums it appears to be blasphemy to suggest that fist spec with a dagger OH could rival pure sword spec using dual swords for pve DPS. However, it does appear to me from the spreadsheet that fist/dagger and an identical talent spec (20/41 with 4 points in Imp Poisons) OTHER than in relation to weapon specialisation results in fist/dagger coming out at pretty much exactly the same DPS as sword/sword (sometimes a little more - sometimes a little less depending on gear). <br>
<br>
I think what happens is that as one's gear gets towards the top end and if you factor in raid buffs swords come out more favourably - but towards the middle to lower end fists are better. It seems to me that gear placing you at around the 750 DPS unbuffed mark with 308+hit (that is with boss mob armour on) yeilds more from fist/dagger but as you go above that swords move incrementally ahead (raid buffed on 750 base results in about 1170 with the most common buffs and swords are a mere 5.5 DPS ahead then).<br>
<br>
Can this be right? Does the spreadsheet factor in the benefits of sword spec fully? It has been pointed out (somewhat bluntly) to me that swords are just plain better full stop but as far as i can see (a) they are not better in the low - mid range of gear - they are worse (b) they are only very fractionally better using insanely good gear. Keeping in mind fists give +crit for better pvp viability and burst i've concluded that fist/dagger is pretty nice. <br>
<br>
Finally - a lot of people mention dual specialisation fist/sword but it has become apparent to me that you are better off avoiding double specialisation and putting the extra points into poisons.........but the point of this post really is to ask if the spreadsheet factors in the benefits of sword spec in a way that people recognise to truly reflect the benefits of that spec.</div>

</div>The first thing I'd note is that for a rogue to only do 750 DPS, your gear needs to be fairly weak; using only quest rewards, BoEs, and 5man drops (not heroics - regular 5 mans) you can put together gear that will do that much unbuffed.  So for the average raiding rogue - which is who this sheet is targetted at - 750 DPS is very much low-end.<br>
<br>
Secondly, I don't think "unbuffed" is necessarily the fairest comparison.  Again, a typical raiding rogue is going to be using at least *some* buffs.<br>
<br>
So, with that in mind: yes, it's true that at low levels of gear, unbuffed, swords do not possess a particularly large advantage over the other available options.  However, I think it is fair to say that as gear increases, swords pull further and further ahead.  For instance, in my current armor with Arena 2 weapons, my buffed DPS with swords is about 1470.  Switching over to Arena 2 fist + dagger, it drops to 1430.<br>
<br>
Now, 40 DPS isn't a *huge* deal, but it is enough to say that swords are pretty clearly better from a PvE DPS perspective.  And, frankly, I would dispute the claim that they're inferior for PvP - the burst damage potential of Sword Spec is not to be underestimated.<br>
<br>
As to the underlying question regarding whether Sword Spec is modeled correctly: I was pretty careful to include everything, so as far as I know it should be correct.  This is not to say that there might not be a mistake somewhere - but I'd need something a little more specifically amiss than "swords don't beat fists by as much as I expected" in order to track it down.</div>

		<div id="post_message_451146">In reference to the above post re: fists vs. swords, it should be noted that the other dps spreadsheet corroborates the result.  That is, swords beat fists, but not by much (the numbers I've seen hover around 1%), and much of that difference is attributable to the fact that available OH swords are better than the available OH fists (specifically, the S2 OH fist sucks).  As well, the other sheet corroborates the fact that combo fist + sword spec does not ofset the points that could have been spent in poisons unless you run with windfury (in which case, it's about a draw).<br>
<br>
As for the pvp vs. pve comparison, the slight edge would go to swords as well, not only because of the slight dps increase, but because that additional 5% you are critting with fists is mitigated by resilience, whereas the 5% extra attacks are not (or are not as much).<br>
<br>
Still, I went with fists for playstyle reasons.  As a sneakerpimp it's essential that my primary attack be a slap.  </div>

<br>
I realize there are likely many small differences between the estimates dps outputs, and that trying to reconcile all of them would be futile...but since the choice of where to put those poison talents is one many raiding rogues face (and least those of us who cannot count on windfury) it would be nice to know which numbers to trust.<br>

		<div id="post_message_451182">Well, I'm tempted to just say "I'm right, they're wrong", but let me try for a more informative answer...<br>
<br>
First question would be "are you using the same poisons in both cases".  What you should observe is that with Deadly Poison, Vile Poisons is better, whereas with Instant Poison, Improved Poisons is better.  If you're using both IP and DP (i.e., one on each hand), my recollection is that Vile Poisons is still better - I know I made a post about it a month or two ago, but I don't remember in which thread - try searching around a bit to see if you can turn it up.<br>
<br>
So, if you do have the same poisons selected in both cases, I'd characterize the answer as follows:<br>
<br>
If you're using Deadly, this sheet is probably right, and the other is wrong.<br>
If you're using Instant, this sheet is probably wrong, and the other is right.<br>
If you're using both and the answers are close, it's conceivable that both sheets handle it correctly and one is just more accurate.  My guess would be this one, but I'm probably biased.<br>
If you're using both and the answers are pretty different, it's presumably a bug in one or both sheets, and would require more investigation.</div>

I have another question that's been bothering me for quite some time, the spreadsheet seems to treat +hit in a linear fashion, 200 + 10 hit is evaluated the same as 308 + 10 hit (which is somewhat of a waste) is this the case so even if I ruin my hit rating I should still get +haste instead?</div>

		<div id="post_message_452023">Strength is a dps stat, but agility gives more dps, so should you completely trash your strength in order to get a better stat? Yes.  <br>
<br>
The interaction of haste and hit is definitely more complex than this, but in general, haste is a more powerful stat, so yes, you will drop below the hit cap if you go for absolutely optimal gear.<br>
<br>
Also, as Ald posted above, it's far FAR easier for a human to make the decision of "Where should I put my 2 blue gems" than it is for the spreadsheet.  The spreadsheet recommends whether or not the set bonus on a particular item is worth going after or not - usually you'll have a few items where it's not, put your blue gems in there, or in a set piece with blue slots that the bonus IS worth going after.  <br>

</div>Right - the recommendations don't factor in metagem activation, so it (possibly mistakenly) recommends using hit gems (or whatever) for socketing Belt of Deep Shadow - this is what the "Socket Bonus?" column means.<br>
<br>
Regardless of what this column says, however, if you have two blue gems in it, the socket bonus is being factored in to computations.  Just because it doesn't think you should be using it doesn't mean it doesn't use it if you have matching gems in.<br>

</div>It's true that the spreadsheet does not account for the hit cap; the reason for this is more or less the same reason it doesn't account for metagem activation.  It's performing a piece-by-piece optimization of your gear, rather than trying to set up all your gear for you at once.  Therefore, while it's capable of recognizing whether or not metagems are activated or that you're over the hit cap, it doesn't really have any good way of knowing where to drop hit or which gems to swap out to solve this problem.<br>
<br>
What this means is, basically: this is a tool.  It provides some useful information.  There are a few things that you still need to figure out for yourself, though.  Fortunately, in the case of metagems, this is pretty easy - you want to put the blue gems where they're going to activate the most (and most powerful) set bonuses.<br>
<br>
For instance, consider the optimal endgame gear, which includes the following socketed items:<br>
<br>
Cursed Vision of Sargeras (YM)<br>
Slayer's Shoulderpads (YB)<br>
Slayer's Chestguard (YYB)<br>
Insidious Bands (Y)<br>
Slayer's Handguards (B)<br>
Slayer's Legguards (B)<br>
Shadowmaster's Boots (RY)<br>
<br>
So, the spreadsheet will tell you to use hit gems in every one of those sockets except the red socket in the boots, where you will want a hit/agi gem, meaning we'll need to swap out two hit gems for agi/sta.  Well, the natural place to put these blue gems is in the items with blue sockets, so as to activate set bonuses. Hence, the reasonable options for socketing with blue gems are the 4 slayer pieces.  The socket bonus on the chest is 8 AP, the shoulders 6 AP, and the legs/gloves 4 AP.  So we're clearly going to get the most mileage out of the blue gems by socketing them in the chest + shoulders to activate 14 AP of socket bonuses in addition to the metagem.<br>
<br>
Regarding the hit cap: again, recall that this sheet is designed to tell you which items our good, and an item with a lot of hit on it *is* good regardless of how much hit is currently on your gear, so the sheet wants to reflect that.  It just means you need to keep an eye on how much hit you've accumulated and not go overboard on it.</div>

</div>The other thing to keep in mind is that having your hit drop down from the cap is not fundamentally a bad thing.  There's nothing magical about being hit-capped.  Admittedly, having a low miss rate is advantageous to your DPS, but if you can get the same DPS increase via crit or AP or haste or other mods, that is in some ways even better than getting the DPS boost from haste.  So if it makes your DPS number go up to swap out for haste gear or whatever, it's worth doing, even if it makes your hit plummet - after all, hit is just a number, DPS output is what matters.</div>

		<div id="post_message_452415">I am a rogue, I have a question on Weapon Skill and Hit Rating and Crit.<br>
<br>
This seems to be a really gray area.<br>
<br>
From a few posts i have read and blogs:<br>
<br>
Vs a level 73 mob/boss without Weapon Skill or Precision.<br>
<br>
The hit rating needed is 403 according to various sources.<br>
<br>
If you add 10 Weapon Skill, then the Hit needed is 387.<br>
<br>
A difference in 16 (or more than likely 15.77) which is 1% hit.<br>
But also 10 weapon skill provides 1% Crit afaik.<br>
<br>
I'm interested in getting the most damage i can possibly get in a raid, this has previously been to stack hit, crit and ap where possible.<br>
<br>
A raid boss in most cases is just one small part of total raid damage, so i'm interested in maximising damage vs lvl 70,71,72 trash etc. How much hit should i be using, i can possibly reach 308 with precision and weapon skill, however vs most mobs, isnt this +hit going to waste? I am a great believer in equipment swapping, would it be worth swopping for example a +30ish hit rating item with a +ap/crit piece for fights vs lvl 72 trash. I feel the answer would be yes if my calculations are correct.<br>
<br>
So i need to know what the +hit needed for: lvl71,72 mob.<br>
<br>
I need to know what effects weapon skill has on these mobs, but the wowwiki posts on weapon skill arnt very clear as they contain a lot of potentially outdated pre-tbc info.<br>
<br>
Do they scale in a linear fashion, e.g <br>
<br>
White attacks vs opponents:<br>
Lvl 70 Hit needed: 378.5<br>
Lvl 71 Hit needed: 386.375<br>
Lvl 72 Hit needed: 394.25<br>
Lvl 73 Hit needed: 402.14<br>
<br>
Above are just examples from some math i did and might be entirely incorrect, would just like to know more how it really works.<br>
<br>
Thanks in advance.</div>

		<div id="post_message_452432">I might suggest taking a look at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071227031755/http://elitistjerks.com/f31/t11885-rogue_warrior_weapon_skill_adjustment_discussion/" target="_blank">[Rogue/Warrior] Weapon Skill Adjustment Discussion</a> which has a bunch of info on the specifics of weapon skill, but here's the general idea:<br>
<br>
If your weapon skill is simply the base 350, it takes a very large amount of hit to zero out your miss chance against level 73s; the base miss chance is something like 28%.<br>
<br>
Assuming you have at least 355 weapon skill *or* the mobs your facing are at most level 72, the following formula will tell you how much total hit you need:<br>
<br>
24% + (.5% per level of the mob over 70) - (.1% per point of weapon skill over 350)<br>
<br>
So, for instance, if you have 2/2 WEx, your base weapon skill is 360.  Thus, against, say, a level 71 mob, your base miss chance will be 24% + .5% - 1% = 23.5%.  If you additionally have precision, this means that you will cap out on hit rating once you have enough for 18.5% hit from hit rating; this works out to be 18.5*205/13 = ~292 hit rating as the cap with 2/2 WEx and 5/5 precision vs level 71 mobs.<br>
<br>
Similar calculations apply for other combinations of weapon skill and hit.<br>
<br>
Oh, and Re: assorted gear corrections: again, all will be in the next patch.  If you find any others let me know and I'll fix them too.</div>

</div>I would assert that the Ashtongue trinket is modeled in excrutiating detail in this sheet.  It's possible to squeeze a little bit extra out of it relative to the model here, but it's pretty darn good.<br>
<br>
Madness of the Betrayer, I'd need to know the proc rate before I can include it.  However, my suspicion is that it'll be slightly inferior, unless the proc rate is a lot higher than I would expect.  If you'd like to get me proc rate data, I'll give you a better answer.<br>
<br>
Similarly, proc rate data on the exalted hyjal ring would be helpful.<br>

</div>The only thing that's going to significantly warp the value of haste is interrupted fights, which, admittedly, are common.  Spreadsheets, such as this one, tend to ignore this problem and assume sustained endless combat, which is admittedly inaccurate but not by as much as you might think.<br>
<br>
So, basically, how haste rating works is: the sheet adds up all the sources of +haste you have, converts it to a %increase, and increases your attack speed by that much.  Not much to it, really.  I guess I'm not really sure what other ambiguities might exist, so if you have specific questions/issues feel free to raise them.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">The first thing I'd note is that for a rogue to only do 750 DPS, your gear needs to be fairly weak; using only quest rewards, BoEs, and 5man drops (not heroics - regular 5 mans) you can put together gear that will do that much unbuffed.  So for the average raiding rogue - which is who this sheet is targetted at - 750 DPS is very much low-end.<br>
<br>
Secondly, I don't think "unbuffed" is necessarily the fairest comparison.  Again, a typical raiding rogue is going to be using at least *some* buffs.<br>
<br>
So, with that in mind: yes, it's true that at low levels of gear, unbuffed, swords do not possess a particularly large advantage over the other available options.  However, I think it is fair to say that as gear increases, swords pull further and further ahead.  For instance, in my current armor with Arena 2 weapons, my buffed DPS with swords is about 1470.  Switching over to Arena 2 fist + dagger, it drops to 1430.<br>
<br>
Now, 40 DPS isn't a *huge* deal, but it is enough to say that swords are pretty clearly better from a PvE DPS perspective.  And, frankly, I would dispute the claim that they're inferior for PvP - the burst damage potential of Sword Spec is not to be underestimated.<br>
<br>
As to the underlying question regarding whether Sword Spec is modeled correctly: I was pretty careful to include everything, so as far as I know it should be correct.  This is not to say that there might not be a mistake somewhere - but I'd need something a little more specifically amiss than "swords don't beat fists by as much as I expected" in order to track it down.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>Hmm - well i have done calculation with boss mob defence on in which case i am pretty sure 750ish DPS unbuffed DPS is not too bad. <br>
<br>
With defence off my sheet shows this for combat swords (saved DPS is the fist/dagger);<br>
<br>
Total DPS	1045.61<br>
Total DPS	1874.15 (buffed)<br>
<br>
saved dps:	1041.47	<br>
saved dps:	1862.44 (buffed)<br>
<br>
difference:	4.13<br>
difference:	11.70 (buffed)<br>
<br>
In a lower damage gear set (my pvp kit) it is:<br>
<br>
Total DPS	925.70	<br>
Total DPS	1424.50<br>
<br>
saved dps:	925.62				<br>
saved dps:	1421.20<br>
 <br>
difference:     0.08<br>
difference:     3.03<br>
<br>
So even less. I suspect therefore that as the gear set gets weaker the fist/dagger option becomes more favourable and there will be a point of inflexion in there somewhere.<br>
<br>
So yeah the difference isn't that noticable but there clearly is a difference that means swords do a bit more damage - particularly at the higher end.</div>

If, for instance, you're a dagger rogue and usually using 5sXr3s and then equip 2/5 T4, the benefit you gain is not that you simply can use a slightly larger rupture in your existing cycle; the advantage is that you get to shift to a totally different cycle, 5sXr.<br>
<br>
Basically, your method on the first few columns, where the benefits applied are small, is usually not going to make a difference relative to max, as you're either going to get the same answer or something very very close.  For the larger bonuses, however, using max captures the fact that some bonuses are significant enough that either a) they allow access to a cycle you previously could not sustain, or b) you adjust your cycle to make better use of them.  Either way, the relevant piece of information is what the maximum amount of DPS that can be squeezed out of the bonus is, and for that I think using max rather than indirect makes sense.</div>

		<div id="post_message_453614">The gear sheet shows the WSC as slightly better than the Ashtongue trinket for me (&gt;1 DPS difference) and I was wondering if it was supposed to be like that or if it's because I stacked armor ignore (476 passive armor ignore from ring+pants+gloves).

</div>Well, I looked it over, and I don't see anything obviously wrong with the WSC comparison; even with my gear (which is in the sheet when it's downloaded), they're within ~5 AP (or 1.5 DPS) of each other, and the fact that you have some armor penetration stacked helps WSC from their.  Also, it appears that having mangle up increases the value of WSC relative to Ashtongue, to my mild surprise.  So, between the two - apparently, yes, WSC is comperable or superior to Ashtongue for you.<br>
<br>
Regarding the ring thing: it's a bug.  Sheet isn't counting the number of rings enchanted with each enchant, it's simply checking whether it's in use at all.  It's an easy fix, and I'll get it out this weekend along with the fixes for other bugs people have found (and, perhaps, a few new features, if I have time).<br>

</div>Well, it has been my perception that as gear improves, hit tends to increase in relative value (for instance, Surefooted passes +12 agi as a boot enchant at some point).  So I think the fact that those have hit is certainly a factor.<br>
<br>
Regarding Ashtongue in particular: seems like the sheet is estimating about 70% uptime for it.  To me, this seems fairly reasonable -  in ballpark figures, with a 3s5r type cycle, you expect to drop a proc every other cycle or so since the SnD only has a 60% chance to proc it, and there is perhaps a small gap after the SnD before you have 5 CPs for the rupture.  So 70% is at least a plausible number to me.  However, since I don't have the trinket (and probably won't for a darn long time, if ever), I can't really verify personally whether that's accurate or not; if you think the actual uptime is higher, I can adjust the model to reflect that (although I'd like to see some combat logs with actual uptime figures before doing so).  However, if we assume that the 70% number is in the right ballpark, it does appear that the trinket is comperable if not inferior to other available options.</div>

Guess you at least need the enter combat, the gain and the fade message to make some conclusions on uptime.<br>

		<div id="post_message_453932">So, long story short: this haste nerf seems to me to be spectacularly stupid.<br>
<br>
Let's review:<br>
<br>
Previously, Dragonspine Trophy was disproportionately good, and a couple of items that dropped in BT and Hyjal that had haste on them were among the better options for their slot; the ideal end-game gear included two items with haste rating on them (Shadow-walker's Cord and Band of Devastation).<br>
<br>
Now, none of the haste rating items are optimal for their slot, and, in fact, most are inferior to vastly easier-to-get items...<br>
<br>
...and Dragonspine Trophy is still way overpowered.<br>
<br>
Doesn't seem to me that they really fixed the problem they were trying to, but what do I know.<br>
<br>
Anyway, next update of the sheet will have the new haste in it, but until then, here are some ballpark figures to use in the meantime:<br>
<br>
* Haste to gloves is no longer a viable enchant.<br>
* Swiftstrike Shoulders are now the 2nd best shoulders in the game, clearly inferior to T6 but still ahead of everything else (by a fair margin).<br>
* Crystalweave Cape no longer competes with epic cloaks.<br>
* Swiftstrike Bracers are now comperable to Deadly Cuffs and thus clearly inferior to Insidious Bands<br>
* Grips of Damnation are now comperable to Deathmantle Gloves, and vastly inferior to T6.<br>
* Shadow-walker's Cord is now comperable to Don Alejandro's Money Belt and Belt of Deep Shadow, and hence inferior to Belt of One-Hundred Deaths<br>
* Band of Devastation drops from the 2nd best ring to the 5th best ring, behind Stormrage Signet Ring, Band of Deceitful Intent, Ring of Lethality, and Band of the Ranger-General<br>
<br>
On the whole, it appears that there's still some value to swiftstrike shoulders, but, barring bad luck, by the time you get the other haste items you will probably already have something else that is as good or better.</div>

* Band of Devastation drops from the 2nd best ring to the 5th best ring, behind Stormrage Signet Ring, Band of Deceitful Intent, Ring of Lethality, and Band of the Ranger-General<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Aldriana if you can direct me to a line of command line code ala "find 'you gain ...'" or a parser, i can run it over ~200mb of Black Temple, Mount Hyjal, SSC and TK combat logs i logged with autoCL. Should give you a really nice estimate on the uptime. I just dont feel like uploading those 200mb <br>
<br>
Guess you at least need the enter combat, the gain and the fade message to make some conclusions on uptime.<br>
<br>
another edit: someone should really consider writing a mod to do something like that... enter the gain and the fade message and just forget about the mod, check a few weeks later and have a really nice set of data.</div>

</div>Writing a parser to see when buffs start and end is certainly pretty straightforward; what's a little harder is figuring out when combats start and end.  I'll have to think about the best way to do such a thing.  When I figure something out I'll let you know.<br>
<br>
On an unrelated note: I think I'm going to take the Arena 1 armors out of the sheet; it's been long enough that I don't really expect too many people to be still using them, they're really not very good, and the armor lists for some slots is getting kind of long.  So unless there are profound objections, they will not be in 0.7.4,</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">So, long story short: this haste nerf seems to me to be spectacularly stupid.<br>
<br>
Let's review:<br>
<br>
Previously, Dragonspine Trophy was disproportionately good, and a couple of items that dropped in BT and Hyjal that had haste on them were among the better options for their slot; the ideal end-game gear included two items with haste rating on them (Shadow-walker's Cord and Band of Devastation).<br>
<br>
Now, none of the haste rating items are optimal for their slot, and, in fact, most are inferior to vastly easier-to-get items...<br>
<br>
...and Dragonspine Trophy is still way overpowered.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>And if they up the procrate on Warp-Spring and Tsunami by 100%, how would they compare (I've fucked around with them a bit on the PTR, since I don't have them on live. They never, ever proc).<br>
<br>
Your spreadsheet has the warp-spring at 107 value, barely better than hourglass of the unraveller, and not as good as abacus of violent odds (though haste re-evaluation should change that).<br>
<br>
Most, if not all of the value, seems to come from the latent stats, not from the proc itself.<br>
<br>
Assuming that DST loses 1/3 of its value (possibly more, given the windfury change, and issues with haste-stacking), it'll be down to 285, which is about double that of even the second place trinket.<br>
<br>
Including the whole haste-stacking thing, let's say a generic value of 220 for DST. <br>
<br>
Still overpowered? Yes, but not out of the realm of buffing other trinkets to points that they might be halfway comparable (ie. 160-180 values on your sheet for warp-spring/tsunami with increased procrate, maybe 215 for Ashtongue if they add some latent stats along the lines of 30 hit and 45 AP).</div>

</div>Just so we're clear - you're using 0.6.3, yes?  That has a bug that undervalues WSC.  The 0.7.x versions have an improved model for WSC, which have it scoring up in the 160-170 range for me, making it a serious competitor for your #2 trinket with DST.<br>

</div>Well, on my sheet, DST is currently scoring 550.  40 of this is AP, the other 510 is the proc.  Nerfing that 510 by 33% takes it to 340, meaning that the total trinket value would be about 380, aka more than the next two trinkets combined.<br>
<br>
Still overpowered?  Yeah, I'd say so. The othet trinkets obey a fairly sensible power progression (all scores with the default gear of the sheet):<br>
<br>
Preraid trinkets:<br>
Icon: 109<br>
Hourglass: 110<br>
Abacus: 111<br>
Bloodlust: 115<br>
<br>
Raid trinkets:<br>
Romulo's: 152<br>
Tsunami: 154<br>
WSC: 165<br>
Ashtongue: 170<br>
<br>
And then you have:<br>
DST: ~380<br>
<br>
Preraid trinkets are all of comperable quality, and raid trinkets all cluster in a pretty good range from 150-170.  And then you have DST, still scoring 380.  Now, 380 is better than 550 to be sure, but it's still in a totally different league of power.<br>
<br>
The better solution, in my opinion, would be to give DST a 30 sec internal cooldown, which would drop it from 550 to ~230 - still good, but much closer to the right ballpark, and wouldn't require rendering all the haste items in BT useless.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
I'm also at 280 hit-rating with my bow, of course, so the +hit on warp-spring and tsunami would be somewhat undervalued, but it's still annoying just how close together any level 70 trinket is to another.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Is the 380 including the issues involving the pre-2.0 fury warrior scaling of haste ratings with one another (abacus, latent haste, SnD, Blade Flurry, etc)? The 40, yeah, sure. But if you reduce the value of DST by 1/3, just from the haste alone, you also have to consider the effect it has on stacking.<br>
<br>
So, 340 haste might go to 300 even, leaving it at 340 all-told, which, again, leaves it within range to be rectified by buffs on other items, or mostly rectified.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Also, I think your assessment of the trinkets is perhaps skewed a bit by your low level of current itemization.

Changes:<br>
*Assorted bug fixes from the last few pages.<br>
*Updated header text on front page.<br>
*Added gem description in addition to gem name.<br>
*Added unique and Black Temple gems.<br>
*Added advanced settings pages to allow modification of more paramaters.<br>
*Removed Arena 1 armor pieces.<br>
*Removed Necklace of the Deep, because it was breaking the sheet, would have been painful to fix, and, honestly, given that it's been broken for 3 months and no one complained, it couldn't have been getting much use anyway.<br>
*Included option to compare gear with or without the haste nerf.<br>
<br>
Only outstanding bug that I know of is the glove enchant issue; it appears to only occur in the Excel version, and I don't have Excel at home so I can't really diagnose it right now.<br>

I'm aware that this update makes the gem list a bit, um, unwieldly.  I'm thinking about solutions to this issue, but for the moment I wanted to get all the gems in.<br>

		<div id="post_message_454427"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->The only post that had the words "Balanced Nightseye" in it that was in this thread just had someone talking about using it to activate a socket bonus.  So, here goes.<br>
<br>
My alt recently got the Midnight legs from Quagmirran and I'm trying to figure out how to socket them.  The sheet is recommending that I use 1 Shifting Nightseye and 2 Glinting Noble Topazes.  This is a result of 12 agility, 12 hit rating, and 6 stamina (counting the hit socket bonus).  Two questions regarding this recommendation.<br>
<br>
One, why is it suggesting a Shifting Nightseye over a Balanced Nightseye?  I was under the  impression that 1 agility wasn't quite as good as 2 attack power in terms of DPS.  Hence, I would think that the 8 attack power would outweigh the 4 agility.<br>
<br>
Two, why isn't it suggesting 3 Rigid Dawnstones?  Everywhere else on the sheet a Rigid Dawnstone is the best gem to use.  This means than 4 hit rating &gt; 4 agility and that 4 hit rating &gt; 8 attack power.  Hence, gaining 12 hit rating would outweigh the 12 agility that the sheet recommends.  Is it the stamina causing the sheet to recommend the Nightseyes and Noble Topazes?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_454451"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->The relative merit of 1 agi vs 2 AP depends largely on your level of buff; with raid buffs, the agi tends to be better; unbuffed the AP tends to be better.  Make sure you have the buffs you feel appropriate selected on the "buffs" page - by default they're set to what's typical of 25 man raiding, which may or may not be approrpriate for you.<br>
<br>
As for the 2nd question:<br>
<br>
With whatever you have selected, it apparently feels you benefit more from the set bonus, and, looking at the comparison, it's a reasonable point to make.  Socketing with the recommended colors gives 12 agi 12 hit 6 sta; socketing straight hit gives 24 hit.  Hence the sheet is asserting that 12 agi and 6 sta is superior to 12 hit, which is almost certainly true if you have "Weighted Total" selected.  If you switch it to "Offense" you'll probably see the recommendation switch to all +8 hit gems.<br>
<br>
Basically: the socket bonus on Midnight Legguards is pretty good, and costs you very little DPS to get, so is likely worth going for.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_454544"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->For what it's worth, the suggestion I've heard (forget exactly which thread here had the link) for balancing sword and dagger raid dps seems to be very good as modeled by this sheet.  That is, making Opportunity a 3-point talent and making Aggression apply to backstab as well.  The changes to the usual 15/41/5 spec would make it 17/41/3 - getting 3/3 Ruthlessness, 5/5 Lethality, and picking up 3/3 Aggression in combat.<br>
<br>
I edited the 5s/Xr/3s sheet to apply Aggression to backstab, and the end result was swords being ahead by ~1% on murder-affected mobs and daggers being ahead by ~1% otherwise, given the same gear (t5/t6) and equivalent level weapons.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">For what it's worth, the suggestion I've heard (forget exactly which thread here had the link) for balancing sword and dagger raid dps seems to be very good as modeled by this sheet.  That is, making Opportunity a 3-point talent and making Aggression apply to backstab as well.  The changes to the usual 15/41/5 spec would make it 17/41/3 - getting 3/3 Ruthlessness, 5/5 Lethality, and picking up 3/3 Aggression in combat.<br>
<br>
I edited the 5s/Xr/3s sheet to apply Aggression to backstab, and the end result was swords being ahead by ~1% on murder-affected mobs and daggers being ahead by ~1% otherwise, given the same gear (t5/t6) and equivalent level weapons.<br>
<br>
Interesting from a 'what-if' perspective at least.</div>

	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>I am a dedicated 'Dagger Rogue'. I leveled from 1-60 as daggers. I leveled from 60-70 as daggers. And I raided for more than a year at 60, and 4 months at 70, as daggers.<br>
<br>
Daggers would still fall behind for a couple of reasons.<br>
<br>
1. Positional requirements: Granted, parries suck for your tank/raid, but it's faster finding your way to a place where you can at least hit the mob as swords.<br>
<br>
2. Proc uptime: Because of procs and PPM, you have close to double the uptime of any given MH proc (Dragonspine, Warp-Spring, Mongoose, etc) with a sword than you would with a dagger.<br>
<br>
3. Cycles: Swords have the 1s/5r cycle (or 2s/5f) by which to quickly ramp up their damage into a "usable range". Daggers will be spending the first 50 seconds of the fight on their 3s/5s, thus never getting the (for my gear) 85DPS from rupture during the first minute of the fight. This adds up. On low health trash, eviscerate is also an option, yielding 61 additional DPS over "just keep up SnD".<br>
<br>
At this point, the only thing that could rectify the difference would be offhand-speed itemization, but they seem content to (even though they intentionally didn't with the S2 gear) put in 1.40 speed offhand PvE-obtained swords/fists/maces, and given how "common" the Warglaives seem to be thus far, any itemization change must be done taking them into account which is, well, impossible.<br>
<br>
Hopefully daggers come back to life in the next expansion.</div>

That's 50% higher %-chance that any given hit will proc, which the greater numbers of MH specials definitely affects. Also include MH sword procs from MH and OH, and other things... double the uptime might have been an exaggeration... but not much of one.</div>

</div>If only autoattacking with no SnD/Blade Flurry/Dragonspine/Mongoose/whatever haste.<br>
<br>
Here's how it works: 1PPM<br>
<br>
60/2.6 = 23.1 white MH attacks in any given minute<br>
Thus, 1PPM means that one of those white hits would proc.<br>
<br>
So, 1/23.1 is 4.33% chance for any given main-hand swing to proc your enchant.<br>
<br>
With a 1.8 speed dagger:<br>
60/1.8 is 33.3333333333<br>
<br>
So you have a 3.0% chance for any given main-hand swing to proc your enchant.<br>
<br>
Ignoring slice and dice, because that affects both equally, you get:<br>
<br>
10 Backstabs + 33.3 white MH autoattacks per minute (+Combat Potency):<br>
Multiplied by 0.03, you have 1.29 total "procs-per-minute) ignoring the internal cooldowns.<br>
<br>
15 SSes + 23.1 white MH attacks in any given minute (+ several offhand and mainhand sword spec procs): 38.1 * 0.0433, or 1.65.<br>
<br>
Granted, this isn't counting the bonuses from combat potency or sword specs, but it still comes out to 27% more procs. If you include the fact that the haste bestowed by dragonspine, mongoose, etc. also increases your chances to re-apply (not counting internal cooldown on any of the above which lowers the difference), with sword spec also included, I wouldn't be surprised to see a solid 60-70% difference on proc-uptime between the two specs.<br>
<br>
I'm not sure why you say that Combat Potency benefits daggers more than swords, given that there's 1.4 speed end-game weapons available for each. You need 3 procs to get an extra SS, 4 procs to get an extra BS.<br>
<br>
Where am I getting confused here?</div>

		<div id="post_message_455455">Swords do generate a somewhat higher proc rate, but it's nowhere near a factor of 2.<br>
<br>
For instance, with the default gear in the spreadsheet (which is sword build), we have the following proc rates/uptimes:<br>
<br>
MH Mongoose: 2.8 procs per minute; 51% uptime<br>
Dragonspine: 4 procs per minute; 51% uptime.<br>
Warp Spring Coil: 1.5 procs per minute; 36.5% uptime.<br>
<br>
Swapping the weapons to, say, Fang of Vashj and Arena 2 OH dagger, our uptimes become instead:<br>
<br>
MH Mongoose: 2 procs per minute; 41% uptime<br>
Dragonspine: 3.4 procs per minute; 44% uptime<br>
Warp Spring Coil: 1.3 procs per minute; 32% uptime<br>
<br>
Now, clearly these proc rates are lower, but we're nowhere near a factor of 2; rather, swords generate about 20-25% more buff uptime, which, while certainly helpful, is nowhere near enough to account for the different in swords vs daggers.</div>

</div>I think the argument is that OH daggers are faster than OH nondagger weapons, as such, the combat potency energy recovery is higher (you get more energy per unit time).  It's true that it takes 50% more energy for a backstab... but then, backstab does a heck of a lot more damage, too.<br>

</div>Eh, again, end-game gear you have Messenger of Fate(Sword), Warglaive OH (Sword), and Blade of Savagery 1.4.<br>
<br>
S2 OHes have a 0.1spd difference, but, as you said it's not enough to make much of a difference.<br>
<br>
The main point of my post was as follows: There are major intangibles involved in the difference between swords and daggers that even making them mathematically very similar would not resolve. One of these is the big cycle problem daggers seem to have for low-healthpoint trash situations. Another is the proc thing, which is a contributing factor, and the third is, again, the positioning issue which is especially obnoxious on mobs that spin in circles.<br>
<br>
I love being dagger specced, if I had my choice I'd go back to it in a heartbeat, but since I made the switch to swords I really can't justify being combat daggers in a raiding situation (it would probably take Malchazeen or the Solarian dagger actually dropping to replace my blue sword or dagger MH, which seems to be  impossible).</div>

		<div id="post_message_455974">You could try mutilate. While people have been skeptical about it, it is viable and even comparable to combat swords in the high end. With the WF nerf and the coming haste rating nerf I assume the build will be even stronger vs swords.<br>
<br>
As for Hydross and Loot Reaver being poison immune, I've never found those fights much trouble anyway. At Leotheras Blade Flurry was nice but it's doesn't make or break the kill.<br>
We didn't use melee on the Vashj adds and there's not a single fight in BT or Hyjal I can think of that favor Swords more than Mutilate.<br>
<br>
I do wish I could go back and pick up Warp-Spring Coil, as it would compliment the Ashtongue trinket very nicely. (Madness of the Betrayer is a bit of a disappointment to me, being worse for mutilate than WSC. At least according to my math.)<br>
<br>
I'd suggest you try the spec out for a few days/weeks since it does require some getting used to. Getting down the right cycles is the biggest issue. (4pc t5 helps with shortcutting your cycles, so much that unless I won't be swapping any of my current pieces for t6 until I get the chest from Illidan. Which hopefully is very soon!)<br>
<br>
P.S Messenger of Fate is the dagger (ugly one at that), Blade of Savagery is the sword.</div>

</div>Well, there's Gurtogg if you get FR (more of a nuisance than anything) and Illidan P2, which is IMO more important than anything else that comes to mind. I'd try out Mut myself if the Azzinoth elementals were poisonable.<br>
<br>
As an aside, do you use slow or fast daggers for your OH? I recall there was a bunch of theorycrafting a while back about how fast daggers in the OH may actually be better for PvE, but I didn't follow it as I was combat daggers at the time.</div>

That's pretty much as tank and spank as they come anymore.  I keep to a 1s/5r cycle, any ideas why the almost 200 point difference?<br>

</div>It's called rough DPS to reflect the fact that the damage computation pages aren't designed for maximum accuracy; rather, they're designed to make for the best possible gear comparisons.  These two goals usually run pretty close, but there are times you have to make a decision that favors one over the other.  For instance, cycles in the sheet are allowed to vary continuously, even though in practice there's no such thing as a 3.7 point rupture.<br>
<br>
That said, the sheet still should be pretty accurate.  In fact, I'm feeling pretty pleased with myself this morning for a reason closely related to this discussion.  Last night on Tidewalker I went the entire fight without getting graved, and did 1203 DPS.  With the level of buff I had active, the sheet predicts 1199 DPS.  So, yeah, seems pretty accurate, at least from that 1 data point .</div>

		<div id="post_message_456310">After the debate of the last page or so regarding swords vs daggers, I decided to take some time and figure out where, exactly, the difference lies, and try to cut down on the amount of rumor and speculation around this topic.  The results, I confess, were somewhat surprising to me.  In truth, there are 3 main factors contributing to the dominance of swords these days:<br>
<br>
1) Murder<br>
2) Mangle<br>
3) Sword Specialization<br>
<br>
What do I mean by this?  Simple.  If one removes these three factors from the damage calculation, swords and daggers are actually very competitive.  It's easy to see how to remove the first two; for the third, we shall simply compare dagger spec to fist spec instead of sword spec to start with (since fist and dagger spec behave identically).<br>
<br>
So, for instance, taking the gear initially in the spreadsheet, but converting it to fist spec with the Arena 2 fists (including the 2.2 version of the fist OH), we get a damage number, without Murder or Mangle, of 1357.04.  If we instead convert the spec to 15/41/5 with Arena 2 Daggers, the damage number is 1346.96. So, if we look at SS builds and dagger builds without the effects of Murder, Mangle, and Sword Spec, we find them very comparable - 10 DPS different, or less than 1 percent.<br>
<br>
Now, lets take a minute to look at each of these factors in more detail.<br>
<br>
1) Murder.<br>
So, the thing about Murder is that while it is very powerful against selected classes of monsters, one *does* fight other things.  In particular, while SSC and TK are very Murder-friendly, only about half the bosses in BT and *none* of the bosses in Hyjal benefit from Murder.  So, depending on your progression level, Murder may or may not be a big deal.<br>
<br>
2) Mangle.<br>
While Feral Druids are fairly common in expansion raiding, that doesn't mean that Rupture is always going to apply; for instance, if said feral druid(s) are tanking other mobs, Mangle will not necessarily be applied to your DPS target.  Moreover, on mobs where you can't/shouldn't rupture, whether because they're immune, or because your guild is concerned with debuff slots, or whatever, this advantage similarly disappears.  For that matter, on short fights (read: trash) mangle doesn't always make sense either; hence there's actually a fairly significant set of fights where this doesn't apply, either.<br>
<br>
3) Sword Spec<br>
And here, at last, is the heart of the matter.  Sword Spec is just really ridiculously potent.  If we convert our previously-mentioned fist rogue to a sword rogue with Arena 2 weapons, his DPS shoots up from 1357 to 1384, a full 2% increase.  But, the key point here, I would argue, is where this damage comes from.  Of that 27 DPS increase, amost all of it comes from the offhand.  When you actually break down the numbers, the contribution to DPS of MH SS procs is almost identical to the contribution of 5% MH crit; literally 90% of the damage increase from fists to swords is due to OH sword spec procs. This, however, is unsurprising; since OH attacks proc MH attacks, and rogues use fast OHs and slow MHs, it is easy to see where this imbalance comes from.  If MH Sword spec is balanced - that is, generating a chance for a 2.6 speed proc every 2.6 speed weapon is correctly balanced, it's not hard to see why generating a chance for a 2.6 speed procs every 1.5 seconds is significantly more powerful, particularly when you additionally consider the the benefit of Fist and Dagger spec on the OH is reduced by the Dual-wielding penalty, while Sword Spec is not.<br>
<br>
What we fundamentally see here is that Sword Spec is relatively too powerful; it is my expectation that we will see one of two things in the next few patches: either 1) Sword Spec procs will again reset the MH swing timer (which effectively halves the power of OH and instant attack SS procs), or OH attacks will start proccing OH swings.  Either of these changes would bring SS back in line with the power of the other weapon specializations.  It is not that daggers are too weak; it is that Swords are too strong, relatively speaking.<br>
<br>
Now, the other side of this argument is that daggers have other disadvantages, such as being positionally dependent and having longer cycles.  So lets take a minute to think about these.<br>
<br>
First off, all rogues do significantly more damage when attacking from behind anyway, hence we're all fairly practiced in staying behind mobs.  And, frankly, I haven't noticed any significant issues with staying behind mobs lately.  There's the occasional circumstance (such as if Gruul drops a cave-in right behind him, or Lurker during Spout) where you can't stay tucked in behind, but on the whole I haven't really noticed any problem with staying in position.  So while it's true that daggers do suffer more from being *out* of position, it also seems to me that for a good rogue this should be a very rare occurrence.<br>
<br>
With regard to cycles: it is true the daggers require longer cycles, and, as such, can't keep them up on short fights.  However, this is mitigated by the fact that daggers care a lot less about maintaining a good cycle.  Backstab is a more efficient move in terms of damage per energy than Sinister Strike is - if you just look at damage done neglecting finishers, daggers are ahead, even *given* the oft-raised issues of proc uptime and the like.  The reason why SS builds do more damage is tied to point 2 above: finisher damage.  So on a short or interrupted fight where you can't maintain perfect 3s/5r cycles all fight - that actually favors daggers. The interrupted cycles are going to hurt the SS builds that rely on lots of finisher damage, whereas the dagger builds that don't gain as much damage from those attacks are going to be less affected.<br>
<br>
So, in the end, the fundamental difference comes down to this:<br>
SS builds have circumstantial advantages, such as benefitting more from rupture on mobs where it can be used, and Murder providing significant benefits against certain opponents.<br>
<br>
Dagger builds have circumstantial advantages such as not relying on short, perfect cycles to gain lots of finisher damage.<br>
<br>
On the whole, these factors perhaps favor SS builds slightly, but not unreasonably so.  I don't think that fist builds, for instance, are particularly more compeling than daggers builds.<br>
<br>
However, Sword Spec - and in particular, OH Sword Spec procs - are very powerful, which is currently giving a clear edge to sword builds.<br>
<br>
As such, I would say that it is not to much that daggers are weak or disadvantaged right now - it is simply the case that sword builds are relatively strong at the current time.</div>

You spend 3 seconds reacquiring position? That's at least 20 energy, possible 40 energy lost, which fucks your cycle and DPS a lot worse with daggers than it does with swords, as well as the fact that, well, gaining CP while reacquiring position and doing DPS is a good thing.<br>

</div>I never insinuated otherwise.  My little essay was not directed at you, or anyone else.  This has been a topic of discussion on these and other forums for months if not years.  I made my conclusions based on the spreadsheet and my personal experience.  I explained why I felt that the disadvantages of daggers were not as glaring as some people seem to believe.  You are free to disagree with me.  If you'd like to present an argument to the contrary, I would applaud your initiative.  I simply asserted that, in practice, I feel that the main persistent benefit that puts swords ahead of daggers is sword spec.<br>
<br>
Revisiting your examples above:<br>
<br>
On Hydross, neither murder nor mangle apply.  The only advantage swords have is a possible positioning advantage (although one that almost never comes up for me) and Sword Spec.<br>
<br>
On Karathress, your feral druids are usually tanking.  Not all mobs will have mangle, which reduces that advantage.  The positional requirements affects both classes equally, with the possible exception of a tick or two of energy being wasted due to not being able to attack while running through the mob. Said tick or two of energy equates to maybe 1k damage.  On a fight where I regularly crest 500k damage, I have no problem with saying a .2% damage loss to positioning time is not a major factor holding swords and daggers apart.<br>

	</tbody></table>
</div>I have never felt that it takes 3 seconds to reacquire position, and even if it does, you only lose energy if you were sitting at the energy cap anyway.  If you are backstabbing continuously, you should never have more than 60 energy saved up, meaning that you can make repositions of 4 seconds or less with a low probability of wasting energy ticks.<br>
<br>
Moreover, as discussed, daggers suffer less from perturbations of their cycle than do swords, as they're getting more of their damage from the backstabs directly and less from the carefully crafted rotation of finishers.<br>

If we convert our previously-mentioned fist rogue to a sword rogue with Arena 2 weapons, his DPS shoots up from 1357 to 1384, a full 2% increase.  But, the key point here, I would argue, is where this damage comes from.  Of that 27 DPS increase, amost all of it comes from the offhand.  When you actually break down the numbers, the contribution to DPS of MH SS procs is almost identical to the contribution of 5% MH crit; literally 90% of the damage increase from fists to swords is due to OH sword spec procs. This, however, is unsurprising; since OH attacks proc MH attacks, and rogues use fast OHs and slow MHs, it is easy to see where this imbalance comes from.  If MH Sword spec is balanced - that is, generating a chance for a 2.6 speed proc every 2.6 speed weapon is correctly balanced, it's not hard to see why generating a chance for a 2.6 speed procs every 1.5 seconds is significantly more powerful, particularly when you additionally consider the the benefit of Fist and Dagger spec on the OH is reduced by the Dual-wielding penalty, while Sword Spec is not.<br>
<br>
What we fundamentally see here is that Sword Spec is relatively too powerful; it is my expectation that we will see one of two things in the next few patches: either 1) Sword Spec procs will again reset the MH swing timer (which effectively halves the power of OH and instant attack SS procs), or OH attacks will start proccing OH swings.  Either of these changes would bring SS back in line with the power of the other weapon specializations.  It is not that daggers are too weak; it is that Swords are too strong, relatively speaking.</div>

</div>How about if Blizzard would change dagger spec (and fist spec) so that 5/5 dagger specialization would give a 7% increase to crit rate ?<br>
<br>
It would make pve damage more balanced with swords.<br>
But it would also make the pvp crowd more likely to pick daggers.<br>
And it would make people happy, who still live in the pre-TBC days, and who think that crit rate is the most important stat. And that seems to be a lot of people.</div>

</div>I think it's a bit of both to be honest. I recently changed from daggers to fists and while the versatility gain may be all intangibles, I felt it was really a huge advantage, particularly as I didn't lose any dps but rather gained it. Our raid progression is currently going in late SSC and TK, so the Murder issue certainly applies.</div>

Uhoh. Since we've passed t5 instances and won't probably run them much after Illidan it seems I'm out of options to get my +5 skill from any of those. There is a certain ring in Lower City. <br>
For spreadsheet calculations can I simply replace the +5skill with 2.5% hit? (vs Bosses at least)<br>
In fact I'll check that now.<br>
*a few minutes later*<br>
This change implied to me that (at least for mutilate) Shapeshifter's Signet is the 6th best ring for mutilate if you do not have any of the three alternatives mentioned above by Aldriana.<br>
<br>
Of course seeing how these results are from the other spreadsheet they probably hold no relevancy to this thread. Perhaps add this to the Rogue theorycrafting thread?<br>
<br>
Edit. Hmm, actually wouldn't it be relative 3% hit increase ? 2.5% from the 350-&gt;355 and then 0.1% from the skill itself (0.1% per skill or whatnot). Or am I wrong at this?</div>

		<div id="post_message_457097"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I would like to continue in the haste rating matter. As the change is a more or less a sure thing, I would like to get suggestions on how to change the items, therefore not having to put them into the trashcan.<br>
<br>
I currently own 4 haste items (not counting the crafted two ones). I would like to start with the Gloves:<br>
<br>
Grips of Damnation<br>
Binds when picked upHands Leather <br>
277 Armor<br>
+27 Agility<br>
+38 Stamina<br>
Durability 40 / 40<br>
Requires Level 70 <br>
Equip: Improves haste rating by 37.<br>
Equip: Increases attack power by 76. <br>
  <br>
As a warrior you are getting this loot as a comparable one:<br>
Pillager's Gauntlets<br>
Binds when picked upHands Plate <br>
1103 Armor<br>
+38 Strength<br>
+45 Stamina<br>
Durability 55 / 55<br>
Requires Level 70 <br>
Equip: Improves hit rating by 18.<br>
Equip: Improves haste rating by 38.<br>
<br>
As in high-end raiding hit rating still remains a highly, if not the most important stat for a rogue, I would like to suggest a change to Grips of Damnation. Give them 18 hit Rating as the Plate Version and either reduce Agility or Attack Power on them accordingly. After collecting four BT Haste Rating Items this the one that I would see the one that now (after the Haste nerf for Melee) would need a change for High-End Raiders.<br>
<br>
Shadow-Walker's Cord is from my point very well balanced even after 2.2<br>
<br>
After acquiring two Bands of Devastation I don't see now any point of continuing to wear them after 2.2. Before the haste rating change they were well balanced even considering their waste of iLvL in favor of stamina. They are at most now an alternative for fights as Reliquary of Souls where you basically always end up tanking.<br>
<br>
So what do other Black Temple experienced people or Rogues well experienced with calculating dps think of changing those items and how?<br>

</div>That would be another way to balance.  However, I think it's somewhat less likely to actually be done.  Setting aside for the moment the way *I* think things should be balanced, I think it's just a lot more likely that blizzard will solve this by nerfing sword spec than buffing dagger spec.<br>

</div>I don't think we'll see tweaks to any of the items, to be honest. The only place where the nerf really seems to break the intended progression implied by the item levels involved is Band of Devestation, as it's inferior to multiple items of lower ilvl. You could make a case that Shadow-Walker's Cord is in the same boat due to both Don Rodrigo's Money Belt and the Vashj belt being superior(an even-level and a -3). If they were going to tweak them, the easiest way to fix them is subtracting stats and adding yellow/red sockets + bonuses. <br>
<br>
My bet is that while doing Zul'aman internal testing they ended up finding some sort of degenerate interaction between existing haste gear and new items that caused them to renerf it.<br>

</div>I agree with you on the gloves.  They are now such a small upgrade for me over Deathmantle (less than 10 AP according to Aldriana's spreadsheet here) that I will save my DKP for t6 and its set bonuses.<br>
<br>
We have had terrible luck with the haste rings (which I am now grateful for) so I will not bother to pick up them at all and they will be void crystals from here on out.  <br>
<br>
As to the belt, I disagree.  I was quite unhappy to read this nerf the day after I spent DKP on it.  It went from the best in slot item to being worse than my crafted belt.  As soon as the change goes likve the shadow-walker's cord goes into the bank until such time as Blizzard re-itemizes in light of this nerf (unlikely).  <br>
<br>
PS. I should clarify that we use zero-sum dkp so its not like we can pick stuff up "on the cheap" now that they are less desirable.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Well I've been playing mutilate since the 2.0 with some forays into swords from time to time. I can agree that Mutilate won't probably beat swords (at least at the moment, before the haste nerf) it offers a very viable spec for high-end raiding that provides a challenge to play. (Not that xs/5r is easy to play or anything.)<br>
However for mutilate to work you really need to itemize your gear (and if possible group setup) for it. <br>
Also 4 pieces of T5, Ashtongue Trinket. <br>
Agility over hit (I value Agility &gt; Hit &gt; Crit &gt;= AP myself) <br>
You gain little by pushing very high hit with mutilate (although 4pc T5 gains some increase in proc frequency from the extra hit)<br>
<br>
Feral Druid. Being without one really hurts. (even though with raidbuffs and Ashtongue trinket I'm avg 38% crit according to swstats<br>
These things really add quite a bit to mutilate dps. <br>
<br>
And above all I have fun playing mutilate. And as serious business as WoW might be I still play it to have Fun.<br>
<br>
I hope Aldriana will someday integrate Mutilate support for this spreadsheet. But seeing how the combat part still needs some tweaking... Well let's just say I won't hold my breath for too long.<br>
<br>
<br>

</div>I'm actually pretty happy with the underlying computations for combat at this stage - they certainly have a few quirks in places, but on the whole I think they're pretty close.  The next round of improvements I want to make are mostly UI changes plus assorted bug fixes.<br>
<br>
Regarding Mutilate specifically, there are multiple issues that make it challenging:<br>
<br>
1) Mutilate cycles just plain work totally differently from SS, BS, and Hemo cycles, due to the "chunkiness" of Mutilate; with SS, BS, and Hemo, you can control exactly how big an SnD or Rupture you're using.  With Mutilate, this doesn't work; you launch mutilates until you have 'enough' combo points (conventional wisdom is that "enough" means 4), and then launch a finisher.  Moreover, once you launch a finisher, you don't have a neat rotation like XsYr; rather, you just sort of check and see what ability is in need of using (i.e., do I need to refresh SnD?  No? Okay, what about Rupture?  No?  Okay, then Envenom).  While I do have some idea how to go about modeling this, my concern is that it's going to smooth things out too much.  My experience with Mutilate is that there's a fair amount of slop in the cycles - lots of wasted SnD uptime and/or SnD gaps, and so on.  The sheet, on the other hand, would have a tendency to model the ideal cycle - no SnD downtime, but no SnD gaps, either - which is hard to do in practice.<br>
<br>
2) Seal Fate makes cycle computation messy.  For those of you that have looked at the calculation pages, you'll have seen that I manually iterate a cycle-selection calculation 3 times to get the right cycle before doing the damage calculations.  With seal fate, this calculation block would need to be significantly longer, as 1) you have to compute crit chance in each cycle, and 2) SF tends to have a fairly large effect on cycles so you may need to iterate it more times to get accurate results.  As such, the calculations page for Mutilate could easily be twice the length of the calculations page for any of the existing cycles.<br>
<br>
3) Weapon speed.  The method I'm using for estimating the damage contribution of weapon speed sort of relies on the fact that we're operating in a fairly narrow range of speeds; regardless of what OH weapon you're using, all other reasonable OH options are within at most .2 speed of what you're using.  With Mutilate, on the other hand, your OH can be up to .6 speed different, which is going to exacerbate the nonlinearities that are already present at .2.  As such, the OH Weapon Speed calculation would need to work totally differently.<br>
<br>
So, long story short: there are some fairly fundamental issues with Mutilate that are holding back development, not the least of which is the fact that I have very little raid experience as Mutilate.  I'm not averse to adding it to the sheet at some future date, but I'm not going to add it until I figure out how to do it right, and certainly not until I get the (smaller and easier) UI changes up and running as well.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>The only two things I can think of off the top of my head that would be affected are Combat Potency and Deadly Poison.  You can't have Combat Potency as Mutilate, so that's not an issue.  Is Deadly Poison falling off really such a big issue (ie is that actually likely to happen with a slow offhand dagger)?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_457497"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Conventional wisdom is that the typical Mutilate build makes use of Envenom, such that you're repeatedly dumping all your DP stack and need to get them back as quickly as possible.  That's the selection pressure keeping weapon speed down.  The selection pressure keeping weapon speed up is the fact that you're making instant attacks with your OH makes slow weapons a good thing, both in terms of increased damage and in terms of increased proc chance of PPM procs.  Neither of these selection effects is probably as strong as combat potency, but the point remains that you have two selection forces pushing in opposite directions, so figuring out what is optimal is a bit harder than in the SS/BS/Hemo case where all selection effects are trying to push weapon speed down.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I noticed one thing as well. I currently have T4 helm and gloves, giving me 2 pc T4 bonus. However in suggested upgrades for helm there is T5 head with 30 dps upgrade. If I put T5 helm in the gear sheet i get 14 dps DECREASE in rough dps estimate. Therefore how can sheet recommend T5 head as a dps upgrade?<br>
Thanks in advance.<br>
<br>
EDIT: Same thing happens with gloves enchant. It says optimal is 26 AP, but if I put 15 agi on them, I get 2 dps increase.</div>

When you don't have the 2 pc set bonus, the tier 5 helm is an upgrade over your t4 helm, but if it breaks the set bonus then it's actually a downgrade.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Yes, I am aware of that, but if I put T5 helm I will lose 2pc T4 bonus so it cannot possibly be an upgrade for my gear at the moment, but yet spreadsheet suggests it.<br>
<br>
This is all in regards to DPS spreadsheet which can take this options into consideration when it proposes an upgrade. And still the problem with gloves enchant remains.<br>

</div>Yes.  The spreadsheet suggests it, as it should.  Deathmantle helm is an upgrade over Netherblade.  The fact that you can't realize that upgrade right now notwithstanding, it *is* an upgrade.  Eventually you do want to switch to it - you just need to get an upgrade for the other slot as well.<br>
<br>
The spreadsheet does not factor in set bonuses when recommending upgrades; this is why there's a separate page to tell you exactly how much each set bonus is worth, so you can figure out for yourself which gear upgrades are actually sensible at the given time.  <br>
<br>
As an example of why the set bonuses are *not* included in the recommendations: if they were, and you were wearing 4/5 T5, you would never be allowed to break it, as no one piece of T6 is sufficient to make up for the 4/5 set bonus.  However, in reality, T6 is better, both because each piece is significantly better than it's T5 counterpart, and because both set bonuses are very good as well.  Hence, you want the sheet to tell you that T6 is good, even if you do need 2 pieces of it before you break the 4/5 T5 bonus.<br>
<br>
Again: the spreadsheet computes upgrades on a slot-by-slot basis.  It does not and cannot look at interactions between them.  It is a tool to help you make decisions.  It is not a replacement for independant thought.<br>

</div>Well I filled in your values from the above armoy link and I do not see this behaviour.<br>
Deathmantel Gloves is shown as a 3.23 AEP upgrade. <br>
Actual using the T5 gloves increases the DPS by about 0.59 DPS and now Grips of Damnation<br>
are shown as a 0.69 AEP downgrade.<br>
<br>
I used the 0.7.4_OO (OpenOffice) version of the sheet.<br>
Maybe something is broken in the Excel version.<br>

</div>On the whole, I would argue that there's adequate coverage for pre/early Kara rogues.  I admit that there are a few slots where there is a shortage of options (chest, waist, and rings come to mind), and I will consider adding stuff to those slots.  With regards to Stealther's Helm: if you're starting Karazhan, you have Helm of the Claw, which is strictly better, so I fail to see much point in wearing something that no one should be using for even the beginning of Kara.<br>
<br>
In a larger sense, the issue is that the assumptions that make a sheet like this possible don't even really become valid until you get the longer fights of 25 mans; hence, the sheet isn't particularly accurate for Karazhan, much less 5-mans and heroics.  Thus, in the interest of usability, I've tried to restrict gear to stuff that someone starting 25-man raiding might reasonably be wearing, which *should* be mostly Kara-level gear with a sprinkling of blies not replaced yet.<br>
<br>
To be perfectly honest, I've actually thought about cutting down the gear lists further, as there are some items that I doubt see much use by anyone, and some of the lists for various slots are getting annoyingly long.  For instance, the following items strike me as unlikely to be used by any soon-to-be-raiding rogue, due to being significantly inferior to an easier-to-get item:<br>
<br>
Gladiator's Helm<br>
Cobrascale Hood<br>
Pendant of Triumph<br>
Gladiator's Leather Spaulders<br>
Sun-Gilded Shouldercaps<br>
Gladiator's Leather Gloves<br>
Gloves of the Unbound<br>
Gladiator's Leather Legguards<br>
Shadowstep Striders<br>
Legionkiller<br>
<br>
Barring major objections, I will probably remove these in some future revision.<br>
<br>
Also note that you can always add your own gear to the sheet if you really want to.  It's not the easiest thing in the world to do, but it can be done.  I just think that most of what's not in here is excluded for good reason.<br>

</div>It's an interesting idea, to be sure, but it's not really possible with the current organization of the sheet.  To get that working would require either A) using an unholy abomination of macros, like the Rogue DPS sheet (which I'd prefer to avoid), B) rewriting the sheet with about 100 extra calculation pages (which has all sorts of bad consequences, not the least of which is the effort involves in writing 100 calculation pages), or C) writing this all in a real programming language (which I won't say will never happen, but don't expect it anytime soon.<br>
<br>
Also, as you note, differences of less than 1 DPS aren't particularly concerning, so fixing it is pretty far down on my priority list.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I have been running 5s/4r of late, but if this can actually hold up, it would be REALLY nice short cycle to use. Or should i take this calculation with a grain of salt. Has any Dagger rogue (if any of you still exist) get a similar cycle and try this out?<br>
<br>
Didn't check my armory, but just in case MH should be Malchzeen and Trinket should be Hourglass.<br>
<br>
Oh and one Minor UI suggestion. Could you Freeze Frame the Damage calc sheets the same way you do the Armors?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Looking at your newest version of the sheet, the Damage Calc Sheet is suggestiing i run the 1/3.44 (3 or 4)r Cycle as a dagger rogue. I haven't tried it yet, but is this even possible or, damn i am at a lost for words, i guess realistic or practical would be a better word?</div>

</div>I typed in your gear from the Armory, although it won't let me load your spec right now.  Anyway, loading up the cookie-cutter 15/41/5 daggers spec, I get a recommendation of 1s/3.01r.  Looking over the calculation pages - I don't see any major problems, myself.  It does look like that cycle should be sustainable.<br>

</div>I actually got the idea to include the 1s/Xr cycles because a rogue in another thread had commented that he had good luck with a 3s/3r cycle.  So people have at least played with such things.  The general theory is that the DPS of rupture actually holds pretty steady from 3 to 5 points; what you mostly lose is duration.  A 3 point rupture lasts for 12 seconds while a 5 point rupture lasts for 16, but the damage over that duration is only 11 DPS lower.  As such, if compressing the cycle heavily allows you to get significantly higher uptime, it's potentially a better cycle than a cycle with a longer rupture.<br>
<br>
In fact, thinking about it a bit more, with daggers, longer SnDs don't actually allow you to increase the rupture size very much.  Consider: increasing the SnD by one point gives you an extra 4.35 seconds of uptime.  Typical energy regen with combat potency is about 13 energy per second; hence, you generate roughly 56.55 energy.  The extra backstab to get that combo point costs 55 energy (60 minus 5 for relentless strikes).  So increasing SnD size by 1 buys you <b>less than two energy</b> to go towards a rupture.<br>
<br>
We see this in practice on the calc sheet; with your gear and the spec I have plugged in, the 1sXr cycle recommendation is 1s3.01r.  The best 5s/Xr cycle it can come up with is 1s3.05r.  So doubling your cycle length from 17.4 to 34.8 seconds buys you, um, basically nothing in terms of the rupture.  It's not hard to see why the shorter cycle is potentially better.<br>

		<div id="post_message_459909"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Yeah i discovered the 3/3 cycle in the past when i was playing with Kalman's version in the other spread sheet. But as the Sheets got updated, the cycle didn't seem to hold. I was wondering if I was doing something wrong. I never really saw anyone ever say anything about it and the few times I mentioned it, people said that anything below a 5 point Rupture wasn't worth it. I never really sat down and did the math by hand so i just went with what i found. Again, thanks for the break down.<br>

In other news, thanks to some nice testing by Uhohzombies in the Mechanics Testing thread, we now have the proc rate for Madness of the Betrayer - it appears to be a 1 PPM proc (shockingly enough, given that everything else is).  So I'll be adding that to the next version as well; as a an estimate in the meantime, it does appear to be slightly superior to both Ashtongue Talisman of Lethality and Warp Spring Coil for a sword rogue.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Much appreciated.<br>

Also, what is 1s/Xr telling me? 1 Snd/random number of rupture cycle?<br>

</div>I've noticed that Belt of One-Hundred Deaths tends to change in value more than some other pieces do; I'm not entirely sure why.  I will review the calcs for it and verify that  nothing is obviously broken.<br>
<br>
It should be noted, however, that item comparisons are made between the "optimal" socketing of each item, such that if you socket one or both items differently than the "optimal" column, the value of the upgrade is going to be different than expected.<br>

</div>Well, the sheet computes damage assuming some baseline armor value, as specified in Advanced Settings.  The default value is 5k.  So it mitigates damage of Sinister Strike, white attacks, etc. by an amount appropriate to an opponent with that amount of armor; in particular, it multiplies damage from those sources by a factor of 10557.5*(10557.5+Armor Value).<br>
<br>
So, when you equip a piece of armor penetration gear, it instead mitigates the armor by the new, reduced value.  So if you have, say, 200 armor penetration, it will mitigate by 4800 armor instead of 5k<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_464131"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Hey Ald.  Thank you so much for continuing to update/upgrade this gearsheet.  I find it invaluable as you know I am too lazy to ever do these types of calculations myself.  You can figure it has saved you tons of time and distraction from me whispering you about gear.   <br>
<br>
In any event, quick question.  Did you change the values underlying WSC's proc or the value of Ashtongue Talisman of Lethality.  I remember reading in this thread or another that theory-crafters thought that AT and WSC were pretty competitive dps-wise, with AT having a slight edge.  For my gear level it is only showing a 19.80 AP increase going from WSC to Madness of the Betrayer whereas it shows a 30.28 AP increase for AT, implying of course that WSC is roughly 10 AP equivalents more powerful for me than AT.  Or is it instead implying that my gear has scaled enough that the Armor Pen from the proc scales more than the extra crit rating proc?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I didn't *intentionally* change anything with WSC or Ashtongue.  Which is not to say I might not have changed something by accident, but, as far as I know, everything should be more or less the same.<br>
<br>
The only thing that I can think of is that I switched Mangle on by default in the buffs page, which does give WSC a slight boost relative to Ashtongue.  So if you've been using the 'default' buff set, that may account for it.<br>

</div>So, the fact that it's doing crit instead of hit is defenitely a bug, and will be fixed in next revision.  The fact that it's not doing orange gems is correct, because orange (and purple) are already counted under red gems, so if it were also under yellow it would be double counted.<br>
<br>
I'm actually not sure why it's split out into gem color there in the first place; I don't see any intrinsic reason not to total over all gems.  However, it was set up that way initially, and I didn't feel like thinking through all the consequences of changing it, so I didn't.  If you want to know the overall motivation, ask Darlal.  In the mean time, I'll clean it up in the next patch or two .<br>

</div>Hmm, that does sound unusual.  I'll look into it and get back to you when I have time.<br>
<br>
Edit: Oh, I see what's happening.  This is actually the bug that Karmon caught; what's happening is that the 10 hit gem is actually being scored as 10 hit and 10 crit, while the 5agi/5hit gem has correct stats.  I'll post a bug fix release this evening with this and the DW Spec changes, plus anything else you guys find in the next couple hours.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Now I'm struggling to find out what to think of armour reduction in a raid situation. Your sheet gives me a rough DPS value of 1500 while in the real world I average about 1300. I suppose the difference can be accounted to the amount of armour that is assumed in the sheet. I'd love to fiddle around with this value, but I failed at Excel and wasn't able to find the relevant cells.<br>

		<div id="post_message_431853" class="post_message_underline">I've been working on the new calculation sheets for a bit, and while so doing it occurred to me that it would really be nice to get the correct values for some of the proc effects built into the sheet on one of these iterations.  In particular, I'd like to get the values of haste effects entered correctly, because they're a pain to change later.  So if any of you are feeling bored and would like to help out, it would be nice if people could take some data sets on the proc rates of various items, most notably Dragonspine Trophy, although the Blacksmithing maces, The Bladefist, and other weapons with haste procs would be helpful as well.<br>
<br>
For a helpful tip on how to get good data on these, swing by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120809091846/http://elitistjerks.com/f31/t14375-rogue_mechanics_testing_thread/" target="_blank">[Rogue] Mechanics Testing Thread</a> and check out post 16.

Along these lines, you still have the link for the very first version in the original post.  You also have the newest versions at the top, but there's not really any reason to keep the link to the old version and if you read through the post and come across the link in the body of the text it seems like it is the most up to date spreadsheet, which it is not.<br>
<br>
Thanks for all the work on this.  I was using the rogue DPS sheet for gear choices as well and was confused as to why it wasn't suggesting +8 hit gems when I am not at the hit cap<br>
<br>
I also have a couple of questions.  <br>
<br>
First, I'm human and using swords but when I switch back and forth between human and NE the current hit value doesn't change.  Does the spreadsheet take into account the human racial bonus to sword skill?  <br>
<br>
Second, how is optimal hit calculated?  In particular it's saying that my current hit is 235 and my optimal is 251.  To the best of my knowledge neither 235 nor 215 is hit capped even with the human racial and using swords with Latro's as an offhand. So shouldn't my optimal hit be whatever the cap is-294?</div>

		<div id="post_message_442791" class="post_message_underline" style="min-height: 183px;">It's sort of a combination of things that are holding up the show at this point.<br>
<br>
1) Mechanics testing.  For the most part, this is in decent shape; I was waiting on this for a while, but at this point I'm mostly at the point where I'm either going to take my best guess or leave out the offending piece of gear for the moment... and mostly the former, probably, given that testing so far has led me to the following rule of thumb:<br>
<br>
<i>All weapon procs are probably 1PPM in absence of significant evidence to the contrary</i><br>
<br>
So, for things that haven't been tested yet (Siphon of the Nathrezim and Blacksmithing Hammers, for instance) I'll probably just fill in 1 PPM for now and will change it later if necessary.<br>
<br>
The only outstanding thing here that I'm at all concerned about is the T5 4/5 proc rate.  This turns out to be sort of a difficult effect to model, and I really have no good data on what the answer might be.  The limited testing I've seen so far makes it appear that the answer is most likely not 1 PPM, so I don't have a good feeling on what to plug in as an estimate.  Still, this by itself wouldn't be holding me up - I'd just take my best guess and move on.<br>
<br>
2) The new calc sheets are a slightly larger job that I originally estimated - there are a few subtleties to implementing them that I didn't initially appreciate, and the planned number of sheets has increased from 7 to 11 (of which 5 are mostly complete, all of which are significantly larger than either calculation sheet in 0.6.3).  So they're taking a bit more time than I originally expected.<br>
<br>
3) The other thing holding up the show at the moment is a sort of communications mixup between Darlal and myself.  In order to support the underlying mechanic changes, there are some UI improvements that need to be made; additionally, there are some general UI improvements that would nice to have made at some point (for instance, the unique gem issue).  He and I discussed these about 2 weeks ago, and he indicated that he thought he might have time to make at least some of them... and I haven't heard from him since.  I guess he got busy with work or whatever.  Now, normally, this wouldn't be a problem; I'd just take a day or two, figure out how to do the UI stuff myself, and plow forwards.  What I'm concerned about, though, is the possibility that he might have started work on some of the more sophisticated changes; if I make the basic changes and then pound out 0.7 based on that + the new calculation sheets, and then he shows up with a version with all sorts of neat UI fixes... we have sort of a problem in terms of merging two fairly sophisticated sets of changes back into one sheet.  So I sort of hate to move forwards until I know what his status is.<br>
<br>
Anyway: I haven't forgotten about this sheet, and I am still working on it, but I don't really have a good time estimate as to when everything will be done.</div>

I think it would be helpful and not hard to just model the effect and assume we are at full health.

As some of you may have heard (or not), in addition to the blanket haste nerf next patch, they also appear to be adding an internal cooldown to Dragonspine Trophy.  Based on 15 min in Blasted Lands last night, said internal cooldown appears to be 20 seconds.  So, if you're like me, you're probably wondering what this does to the value of the trinket.<br>
<br>
And the answer is: it's still the best trinket in the game by a decent margin.  I hacked a copy of the spreadsheet to model this, and I come up with the following valuations of trinkets (assuming my gear/spec):<br>
<br>
Dragonspine Trophy: 238<br>
Madness of the Betrayer: 176<br>
Ashtongue Talisman: 170<br>
Warp-Spring Coil: 156<br>
Tsunami Talisman: 149<br>
<br>
So, it's still pretty clearly the winner.  Which, the way things have been going, probably means it's going to be nerfed some more.  Personally, I'm hoping they bump the internal cooldown up to, oh, 45 sec or so and revert the haste nerf (which would still leave it as the best trinket in the game, but by a more reasonable margin).<br>
<br>
Anyway, yeah.  It's being nerfed, but it's still the best game in town.<br>
<br>
As a side note, assuming Warglaives wind up with the same internal cooldown as Dragonspine (which, honestly, seems likely), I estimate that rogues will be topping out in the ballpark of 2100 DPS in long sustained fights.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_468300"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I haven't played my rogue since BC came out and I rerolled Paladin. I've recently been playing my rogue again and just hit 69. I came across the anesthetic poison. I was wondering if someone could answer for me which is a better poison to use as far as raiding instant poisons? I noticed that anesthetic has about 30 less damage then instant. Is the "no additional threat" mechanic in Anesthetic effective enough to overcome the damage you lose from poisons? It seems like one would rather use anesthetic, but I'm not sure if I'm missing something.<br>

		<div id="post_message_468310"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Depends on the fight, and your tank.  On most fights, if your tank has good aggro, you can basically go all out using only vanish as your aggro dump, hence the zero-threat mechanic is irrelevant and you might as well use instant poison.  However, on fights with frequent aggro resets and/or deaggros, particularly if your tanks aggro is a bit sub-par, the zero threat can be useful.<br>
<br>
As a rule of thumb: use Instant Poison unless you have significant reason to do otherwise.  If you find yourself feinting constantly and/or needing to hold fire to avoid pulling aggro, then switch over to Anaesthetic.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Well, I would argue that if your rogues are pulling aggro frequently, then either a) they need to get better at managing the use of vanish or b) your tanks aggro could use some help.  For instance, I would argue that the only fight in SSC/TK where the aggro situation is such that vanish + a good tank isn't necessarily equal to the task is probably Leo.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Thanks for the input Aldriana. I had a feeling it would be situational, but I wanted to check. Had a combat rogue in our guild always complaining about pulling aggro, and then I found out he never uses anesthetic poison. I wanted to do some research on the theorycraft behind the new poison before I said anything to him. <br>
<br>
Figured this would be one of the best places to check as I highly respect the opinions of the forum posters in Elitist Jerks. Any other opinions would be appreciated, but that was pretty much the answer I was looking for.<br>

</div>Poison isn't a huge contributor to Rogue TPS. 187 damage (w/ 1/5 Vile) every 2 seconds, or 75ish TPS). Compared to the 900-1200 DPS that your rogue's putting out, it won't make or break the bank, but, if you're having issues with debuff slots anyway, might as well use Anesthetic instead of instant/deadly, since it's not a terrifyingly huge DPS loss, but does help a bit on fights where you might have some issue with aggro (See Warrior offtank on Gruul).<br>

Personally, I didn't stop wearing WW Shoulders + Gloves till I had T5 for both slots.  However, as a dagger rogue, the T4 2/5 is more powerful and is generally more worth getting, so it's potentially worth breaking WW to get Netherblade.  Of course, ideally, you hold on to *both* 2/5 set bonuses for a while, and then you're back into waiting-for-T5 territory.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I would argue that, in a vacuum, the shoulders (and helm, if you're not an engineer) are both more worthwhile than the legs, which are a sidegrade to Skulker's.  But the real value of T5 is in... guess what... the set bonus.  Assuming I have the 4/5 T5 set bonus proc rate even close to right in this sheet (and I think I do), one actually gets a significant DPS boost from the set bonus which makes 4/5 T5 worth using well into MH/BT (in particular, it's not worth breaking until you can get 2/5 T6).<br>
<br>
Also, I'd again point out that there's no mystical significance to being at the hit-cap.  With my current gear setup I'm at 274, and I do more damage than ever before.  Sure, you can get pretty good stats with Karazhan + Heroic gear.  But you can get even better stats with SC/TK gear, and better still with MH/BT gear (assuming you pick the right pieces, of course - but that's why we have spreadsheets for that sort of thing).<br>

</div>I disagree with this.  While it's true that eventually all set bonuses end up getting broken, that's no reason not to make as much use as possible of them in the meantime.  Sure, eventually you're going to want to break 4/5 T5 to go to T6, but in between you clear about a dozen bosses and there's no reason no to use the damage output from 4/5 in the meantime.<br>
<br>
In the specific case of WW 2/5: you already have it, so you might as well wear it.  This doesn't mean you shouldn't pick up upgrades for those slots at some point; what it means is that if you pick up an upgrade for one slot and are deciding whether to wear it immediately or wait until you get another upgrade, you should factor in the set bonus.  Is it worth getting T5 shoulders over WW?  Obviously.  But should you equip them the moment you get them, breaking the 2/5 set bonus?  Probably not; you should wait till you have an upgrade for the other slot as well.<br>

</div>While it's true that attention to detail while actually playing is a larger factor, it's also true that paying adequate attention to get to 95% of the damage potential of your gear isn't particularly hard on the vast majority of fights.<br>
<br>
Additionally, the effect of gear is not to be underestimated; it's not unreasonable for one's damage output to roughly double from early Kara-level gear to end-BT level gear.  So while it's certainly not the only effect that effects your damage output, or even the largest one, it's certainly non-negligible.<br>
<br>
Besides which, I would argue that if a question is posted on a gear comparison spreadsheet thread, the questioner is sufficiently interested in optomizing his gear that it's worth getting the answer right; even if the right gear selection was only 1% of your total damage output (and it's a lot more than that), that doesn't mean it isn't worth doing right.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_469304"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I can't agree more with Aldriana. 4 piece t5 is almost equal to 2 piece t6 and at that point the stat increase from t6 tips the balance in it's favor. For that effect I really would've preferred t5 chest over bloodsea (not that either dropped for me... Conniver-&gt;T6...), since you're not swapping that out any time soon. Helm...is a tricky thing. If you want 4piece as soon as possible it's easier to kill Archimonde, but on the long run holding T5 Head-Chest-Legs-Shoulders with T6 gloves until you can pick up Chest/Shoulder/Pants is really worth it. And Illidan helm is superior to T6 anyway so you're not sacrificing a lot. <br>
<br>
Before that breaking t5 is rather pointless. Especially if you take note of the haste nerf. Not many non-set items are available (if any?) besides the soon-to-be nerfed haste itemization.<br>
So there really isn't any reason not to take t5. You shouldn't be hit starved anyway at that point so that's not a issue (Deep Shadows with 2x 8hit, WSC/Tsunami). Overall the offensive stat increase on t5 covers any lost hit anyway.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">...as near as I can tell, it's computing DPS in an abstracted situation that doesn't actually occur in any real fight. The assumptions about sustainability aren't even valid for Patchwerk, much less any other fight. It's calculating the numbers assuming, roughly speaking, a fight of infinite length against a stationary target with no tea use. Whereas in practice, the longest uninterrupted stationary fight we have is Patchwerk at 7 minutes, and that's short enough that the edge effects do matter. So, yes, as a theoretical exercise in damage computation, it's fine - but has nothing to do with any real situation, even neglecting the issues of stamina and survivability.</div>

</div>I wanted to respond to this, even though the quote is really old, given how I was one of the authors of the original DPS sheet. The caveat that it only works for sustained fights is very much true, and this was something that I tried to make clear whenever describing the sheet.<br>
<br>
However, I disagree that the sheet was inaccurate for a fight like Patchwerk. Perhaps it was in your usage case, but at least for me it was extremely accurate. I could put in exactly what buffs, potions, and gear I had and the returned DPS was within 1-2%. Which given the DPS was around 700 in total, that's a pretty good margin of error. Not saying it was perfect, because of course it had issues, and there were assumptions that were made. But overall, it was rather accurate for something like Patchwerk where you could DPS non-stop with no worry of dying.<br>
<br>
I think calculating for the "assumed sustained DPS" is fair, because otherwise you really don't have any baseline to compare it against. There's so many fights and situations that you really would go crazy trying to compute for all the specific scenarios.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_469333"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I'd actually argue for using T5 helm over chest, given that there are some very compelling chests that drop quite early in Hyjal/BT; Nether Shadow Tunic drops off Supremus, and Midnight Chestguard off Archimonde (which the earliest you can get a helm upgrade after Deathmantle); both of these are *significant* upgrades over either Deathmantle or Bloodsea Brigand's.  When you throw in the fact that, long term, you don't actually want to use Slayer's Helm anyway (as Cursed Vision + the other 4 pieces of T6 is optimal), I would argue that using 4/5 T5 +  nonset chest until you down *Shahraz* and can swap out for T6 gloves + shoulders is probably the way to go.  Of course, Slayer's Helm is a fairly massive upgrade in it's own right, so I could see the argument for breaking 4/5 T5 with Helm + Gloves and waiting to upgrade to Cursed Vision until after you have the other 4 pieces of T6.<br>
<br>
...of course, this is all purely hypothetical, as, only having killed Kael for the first time last week, it'll probably be a while before I have access to any T6 at all.  However, the point remains; from a theoretical point of view, it's hard to argue that 4/5 T5 until at least Archimonde if not Shahraz is optimal.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Admittedly, when I made that quote I was to some extent exaggerating for effect; however, I do think there is some merit in the assertion.  My particular argument is that endless combat does not consider the fact that you A) start with one hundred energy or B) can squeeze two ARs into a 7 minute fight.  When you work it out, your actual available energy for the fight was more like 4600 (4200 + 100 starting + 2x150 AR) than the 4410 (4200 + 1.4x150 AR) that sheet predicted.  And while a 5% energy discrepancy is not a *huge* deviation from theory, it is enough to tweak the white/yellow damage balance a bit, which will in turn cause slight adjustments in the value of stats, such that if two items of very comparable quality were modeled (such as, for instance, Bonescythe Belt and Belt of Never-Ending Agony or Deathdealer's Vest and Bonescythe Breastplate), the answers could change a bit relative to the endless combat model.<br>
<br>
More to the point, at the time it was actually possible to do better; I included in the sheet I had been using at the time a parameter by which one could adjust the number of seconds of autoattack damage that you were able to perform between each backstab, on average; in an endless combat model, neglecting AR, this would be 7.8, in that you have 6 seconds between backstabs and 30% haste active from SnD.  However, when I measured this parameter in actual fights, I found it tended to range from about 5 (on Chromaggus, Twin Emps, and the like) up to a little over 7 (for fights like Patchwerk).  I could then adjust this parameter within my sheet to get valid DPS numbers over a range of fights, which I considered to be a superior implementation (in terms of accuracy if not user-friendliness) at the time.<br>

</div>In the expansion, I certainly agree; the fact that white and yellow damage can no longer be easily separated as they could pre-expansion due to Combat Potency, haste procs, cycle maintenance, and so on means a more sophisticated model of the interaction is necessary.  In the expansion, to obtain truly accurate results, one must know the exact uptime/downtime pattern of the fight to get good results, which is just not practical.  Hence, a sustained calculator is about the best you can do - which is why this sheet is what it is.  However, I do maintain that preexpansion mechanics were sufficiently straightforward that modeling interrupted fights was possible.<br>
<br>
As long as we're on the topic, I should mention that I've been thinking about this problem for a few weeks, and I'm starting to get some ideas about how to model  more interrupted fights.  I haven't solved all the issues yet, but I do think it might be possible to put together a useful if not perfectly accurate model of interrupted combat; as I'm starting to run low on other features to implement, I may try to build such a thing in at some future date.  No promises, but it is something that I'd like to try to do.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I'd actually argue for using T5 helm over chest, given that there are some very compelling chests that drop quite early in Hyjal/BT; Nether Shadow Tunic drops off Supremus, and Midnight Chestguard off Archimonde (which the earliest you can get a helm upgrade after Deathmantle); both of these are *significant* upgrades over either Deathmantle or Bloodsea Brigand's.  When you throw in the fact that, long term, you don't actually want to use Slayer's Helm anyway (as Cursed Vision + the other 4 pieces of T6 is optimal), I would argue that using 4/5 T5 +  nonset chest until you down *Shahraz* and can swap out for T6 gloves + shoulders is probably the way to go.  Of course, Slayer's Helm is a fairly massive upgrade in it's own right, so I could see the argument for breaking 4/5 T5 with Helm + Gloves and waiting to upgrade to Cursed Vision until after you have the other 4 pieces of T6.</div>

</div>Uh, If I remember correctly the spreadsheet didn't add the dps increase from the set bonuses (otherwise it wouldn't suggest any single t6 piece over 4pc t5). So to check if it's worth losing 4 piece dm you need to consult the Set Bonus Values on the Spreadsheet.<br>
I'm pretty sure that it wouldn't be worth it though. Only reason to break 4/5 DM is 2/5 Slayer's.<br>
Other than that I don't see any combination that would break it.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_469431"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Well, the short answer would be "plug it into the spreadsheet and find out" - the "Rough DPS" estimate should be adequate to figure this out.  The somewhat longer answer would be that it depends on a variety of factors, but probably not.<br>
<br>
1) First, Skulker's are really only a 14 AP upgrade assuming you're able to socket them with BT gems, which, depending on your guild's gear situation, may or may not be possible; if you're comparing socketing with Blue gems in both cases, Skulker's is a sidegrade more than an upgrade to Deathmantle.<br>
<br>
2) It somewhat depends on where you are on the hit and stamina spectrum.  If you're anywhere near the hit cap (which, depending on what sort of fights you're doing these days, can be reasonably considered to be as low as 284), you may not have the room under the hit cap to absorb the full benefit of Skulker's Greaves.  On the other hand, one of the benefits of Deathmantle that keeps them somewhat close is that it presents a significant stamina upgrade, which, if it's not necessary for you at the moment, may reasonably be discounted as a benefit thereof.  So if you're high on hit and/or low on sta, Skulkers is probably not a good choice.<br>
<br>
But, assuming for the moment that neither 1 nor 2 applies, that you have sufficient epic gems available to gem your Karazhan gear, and the hit and sta factors do not apply, in terms of raw damage output, it *still* looks to me like 4/5 is good enough that Slayer's Helm + Skulker's Greaves is insufficient reason to break it; not by a whole heck of a lot, of course, but even with BT gems I only count an 81 AP upgrade for Slayer's Helm over Deathmantle, compared to a 116 AP bonus from 4/5.  So it would take a 2nd upgrade on the order of 35 AP to qualify, and Skulker's over Deathmantle does not qualify.<br>
<br>
All in all: for a variety of circumstantial reasons as well as the straight-up-damage argument, I'm reasonably confident that breaking 4/5 T5 without getting 2/5 T6 is never worthwhile... <b>assuming</b> that I have the proc rate for 4/5 anywhere close to right.  However, as I have mentioned before, the 4/5 number is purely an estimate, and until Vashj gets around to cooperating (she hasn't dropped a rogue helm in close to a month), I have no ability to test the accuracy of it.  So it may be that I am over (or under) estimating the value of 4/5, so take all this analysis with a grain of salt until someone gets around to testing that proc rate.<br>
<br>
On a related note, I'd also still be intereted in seeing proc rate info for Band of the Eternal Champion, if someone who has it would like to do some testing.  Or, alternately, if someone would like to invite me to an end-hyjal guild so I can rep up and test myself... .<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_470591"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->With enough haste and hit, a very fast OH, and 2/5 T4, one can run into a situation where 1s5r cycles can be completed in under 16 seconds, meaning that you have a bit of slack energy that could theoretically be used to maintain a longer cycle.  However, I'm not aware of any proposals better than "ignore the problem and keep doing 1s/5r" for dealing with this situation.  1s5e and 1s5r1e can both be shown to be inferior with relative ease, meaning that the next "compressed" cycle achievable is 1s5r2e, which is at best marginally superior and in practice requires unattainable energy regen (as I recall).  The other alternative would be to return to longer cycles and do something of the form 5s5rXe.  I haven't run detailed numbers on this, but my feeling is that it's most likely inferior as well, given that such a cycle will only achieve ~50% rupture uptime which offsets the damage gained by eviscerate.  So, at the moment, I think the best known option is to just stick with 1s5r.<br>
<br>
On a related note, it might also be noted that there exists an itemization level past which 1s5r is no longer optimal; when ones gear reaches this level, it actually becomes optimal to do 5s5r even if you could support a shorter cycle.  But I don't think there are many (if any) rogues that are quite at that level yet, so it's not a major concern .<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_470651"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Roughly.  I mean, the fundamental idea is as follows:<br>
<br>
In a 5s/5r cycle with Relentless Strikes, the SnD and Rupture are free.  So all energy is going into sinister strikes.<br>
<br>
In a 1s/5r cycle, the rupture is free but the SnD costs, on average, 20 energy.  Hence, only about 90% of your energy regen is going to sinister strikes.<br>
<br>
Hence, with 1s/5r, you are actually launching about 10% fewer Sinister Strikes per unit time than with a 5s/5r cycle.  At most reasonable levels of itemization, the is outweighed by the 50% increase is Rupture uptime.<br>
<br>
However, if your AP and Crit% get high enough, it is theoretically possible to reach a point where the extra sinister strikes will do more damage than the extra rupture uptime, and at this point, 5s5r takes over as the optimal cycle.<br>
<br>
Now, it takes a *lot* of AP and Crit (and, I guess, armor penetration) before this happens; I'm not sure if items actually exist that are equal to the task.  But from a purely theoretical standpoint, it could happen.  I'll try to dredge up my numbers on where the crossover point is in the next day or two.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>With the Merciless gladiator's weapons, i've seen sinister strike crits near or over 2K, about the same as a 5 point eviscerate.<br>
The reason rupture is good, is because it costs 10 energy less than eviscerate and thus has a much lower energy "bleed" which will allow you a more steady finisher rotation. That, and it works very nicely if you have a feral druid in the raid doing Mangle.<br>
<br>
With 2 pieces of Netherblade, you'll probably be using a typical 1s/5r cycle.<br>
Without those 2 pieces, you'll more likely to a 3s/5r or 5s/5r depending if you have combat potency, and your hit rating / haste / offhand speed.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<!-- message -->
		<div id="post_message_471449"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->So, a quick follow up on some comments I made yesterday:<br>
<br>
1) With my current gear + usual buffs, the average damage dealt by a sinister strike is 1557 (premitigation).  The average damage done by a 2-point evis would be 1216.  So yes, the SS does more.<br>
<br>
However, SS costs 40 energy and a two-point Evis only 25 (with Relentless Strikes); hence the energy efficiency of the SS is only 38.9 damage per energy, while the evis does 48.6 damage per energy; hence the evis converts energy to damage more efficiently, and is thus potentially worth using in a cycle.<br>
<br>
2) As an example of itemization that makes 5s5r superior to the minimum cut cycle, consider the following gear setup:<br>
<br>
Cursed Vision of Sargeras (RED, Glinting Pyrestone)<br>
Choker of Endless Nightmare<br>
Slayer's Shoulderpads (Glinting Pyrestone/Shifting Shadowsong Amethyst)<br>
Shadowmoon Destoyer's Drape<br>
Slayer's Chestguard (Glinting Pyrestone x2, Shifting Shadowsong Amethyst)<br>
Insidious Bands (Glinting Pyrestone)<br>
Slayers' Handguards (Delicate Crimson Spinel)<br>
Don Alejandro's Money Belt (Delicate Crimson Spinel/Glinting Pyrestone)<br>
Slayer's Legguards (Delicate Crimson Spinel)<br>
Shadowmaster's Boots (Delicate Crimson Spinel/Glinting Pyrestone)<br>
Stormrage Signet Ring (Striking enchant)<br>
Ring of Deceitful Intent (Striking enchant)<br>
Madness of the Betrayer<br>
Dragonspine Trophy<br>
Warglaive of Azzinoth<br>
Warglaive of Azzinoth<br>
Twisted Blades of Zarak<br>
<br>
Now, with the buffs set to the default with which the sheet is uploaded, the recommended cycle is 3.2s5r, as usual - so the energy regen is sufficient to support such a thing.  However, if you click off Mangle, the cycle recommendation switches to 5s5r, despite the fact that 3.2s5r is sustainable.  This is because the gain in energy spent on Sinister Strike is sufficient to offset the loss of rupture damage.<br>
<br>
Now, admittedly, this does require a high level of itemization (that gear setup yields an average 41.3% crit rate, 3660 AP, and 630 armor penetration - note that those are time-averaged raid-buffed stats, and not base stats), and some questionable socketing decisions (using Agi over Hit in a number of slots) - but it can happen.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_471632"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I've been following these forums for a good while, but this is my first time posting.<br>
<br>
I took a break from BC for about 5 months and came back a few weeks ago, at which point I dove into engineering and leatherworking in an attempt to catch my dps up to my guildies (via the eng helm and primalstrike set). I've also been grabbing stuff out of Karazhan as we put Gruul on farm, and will get T4 2pc and DST soon, drops permitting.<br>
<br>
Given my gear level, my AP is somewhat high (over 1800) and my crit rating is just over 30%, but my hit rating is 186. I'm not trying to shoot for big crit numbers or to have the highest AP in my guild, it's just that every recommendation by the spreadsheet devalues hit rating for me. As an example, I was recently evaluating how to gem Skulker's Greaves, and triple +8 agi came out ahead of all other rare gems (especially raid-buffed). My question is: should I try to reach the hit cap first, regardless, and only then look at potential upgrades through other stats? Is being hit capped so much less important for a dagger rogue compared to a sword rogue that it's okay for me to be this low?<br>
<br>
I'd like to emphasize that I don't mean for this to be a question about what gear to get, since I clearly have many required upgrades and many of those will increase my hit rating.<br>
<br>
I've also thought about many of the fights my guild is currently doing. Almost none of them allow for uninterrupted dps, which seems to make hit rating even less useful since a larger proportion of my damage is coming from backstabs (which benefit from AP and crit, but not hit rating, at least above an easily-reached threshold).<br>
<br>
I'm probably just missing something obvious. Thanks in advance guys.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>In general Hit Rating is very important though other stats can be better.  Hit rating is less important with certain gear sets.  For example when you don't have any procs from trinket or meta gems hit becomes less valuable than if you had such procs.  <br>
<br>
One thing to keep in mind is that there is nothing special about being hit capped.  The reason that is is mentioned as so important is that hit rating is almost always the best stat point per point and so if that is the case for you then you should push towards that.  <br>
<br>
A good example of how stacking hit rating is not always the best thing to do is if you look at t5 vs t4 you will see alot less hit rating on t5.  T5 is still better due to all the other stats it has on it.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

2. Get NB legs/chest, which would open up the possibility for Deathmantle pieces when they come available, but also lock me into Netherblade for DPS purposes until such time that I can pick up the remaining pieces of deathmantle (working on Leotheras, so 4pc DM is a while away).<br>

</div>Fundamentally, what makes +hit powerful is that rogues gain a lot of DPS from proc effects, and effects can't proc if you're not hitting.  This is why sword rogues benefit from it more strongly than dagger rogues: because sword spec is a proc, while dagger spec is not.<br>
<br>
Moreover, in your particular case, you don't yet have many of the other important procs that rogues benefit from (Dragonspine Trophy and 2x Mongoose enchants, for instance).  This further depressed the value of hit.  Additionally, your OH is a bit slower than those used by most dagger rogues, which reduces the effect of combat potency somewhat as well.<br>
<br>
Finally, the damage output of pre-Kara weapons like you are using lowers the raw weapon damage that you are putting out, which thus lowers the value of hit even further.<br>
<br>
All in all: while I am a bit surprised the extent to which hit rating is discriminated against by your current gear, looking through your gear/spec, I can sort of see where it's coming from; I would expect that as your gear improves, you will see the value of hit increase.<br>

</div>For weapon skill under 355, this sheet is not accurate.  For weapon skill 355 and over, it should be... reasonably accurate.  I can't say totally accurate since I don't think the full effect of weapon skill is actually known at this point.  But it's as accurate as I know how to make it.<br>
<br>
Now, if weapon expertise isn't changing OH damage at *all*, that's probably a bug.  If it's changing it, but not by very much, that's probably correct.<br>
<br>
Regarding differences between the two sheets: assuming a) I have the proc rate on both correct (which I'm reasonably confident allbeit not certain that I do and b) Dragonstrike is not given an internal cooldown next patch (and it wouldn't surprise me in the least if it was), I believe that this sheet is correct.  Now, admittedly, I'm likely somewhat biased in this (being the author and all) but as a general rule I do think this sheet does a better job of encoporating all the subtleties of the unusual proc effects that show up, such as Rod of the Sun King.<br>

</div>Yes, but the scaling in question isn't related to energy regen increasing; in practice, energy regen caps out under 14 energy per second, meaning that a 5s5r cycle will never have more than 65% or so rupture uptime.  The scaling effect in question is that a) crit and armor penetration increase the damage of sinister strike but not rupture, and b) assuming reasonable crit and armor penetration, sinister strike scales more quickly with AP than does rupture.  So, if your crit, AP, and armor pen get high enough, you can get to a point where the extra SS are worth more than the extra rupture uptime.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I've always been of the opinion that T4 set bonuses are somewhat uninspiring as a sword rogue.  As a dagger rogue, they certainly have their place.  But as a sword rogue, I just don't find the benefit to be that big.  This is (among other reasons) why I never got more than 1 piece of T4.<br>
<br>
Looking at your gear setup for a moment:<br>
*Your helm is significant better than T4<br>
*Your legs are already somewhat better than T4.<br>
*T4 gloves are mind-blowingly bad, particularly when compared to T5 gloves.<br>
*If your guild is anything like mine, T5 shoulders will drop in price at a decent rate, as VR is a total farm job.<br>
<br>
So I don't see that there's a lot of T4 you'd want to wear very long.  It depends, of course, on how large an intermediate damage drop you're talking about and for how long you expect it to last.  But my philosophy on T4 was that there wasn't anything compelling enough in T4 to warrant significant DKP expendature on it, such that I only picked up those items that I could get cheaply.  Rather, I kept using my Karazhan loot + 2/5 WW until I could pick up T5 and T5-equivalent (i.e. Bloodsea Brigand's Vest, etc.) loot.  But, doing it the other way works too; just a matter of personal preference.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I've already got the T5 shoulders, just haven't been wearing them yet because of the hit I take from losing the 2pc NB bonus (moving to deathmantle shoulders is something along the lines of <br>
11DPS lost, depending on how I happen to gem them.<br>
<br>
Again, I'm really unsure about which piece of T4 to take to continue the bonus. T4 legs would let me maintain my 2pc bonus with gloves, for now, while only costing me something along the lines of 150g to add a cobrascale armor kit to, while using the 2pc shoulders, especially as there's probably a few shamans and another rogue ahead of me on the gloves for now. I really, really do not want to lock myself into the chestpiece instead of the Bloodsea Brigand's though.<br>

Since T5 legs already kinda suck, and as you mention, my current legs are "somewhat" better than T4, I sort of feel like it would be worth the bid, especially as they're *almost* on "side-spec/burn" status at present.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_472152"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->According to the sheet the 2piece bonus of NB is worth 55ap for my gear. Considering I only have T5 content "checked", the only upgrade that offers such increase in ap is karathress chest or just going from maces to swords.<br>
I'm trying to decide which t4 piece should I go for, having legs right now. I'm using Engineering googles// bladed shoulderpads// Conniver's chest and fel leather gloves. The only real upgrade beyond set bonuses is the chest, the others are just downgrades. But considering I will have access to karathress chest some day, I guess I'll pass on Mag tokens and go for the gloves(they are the lowest downgrade from my current gear to NB) <br>
<br>
About the OH/Weapon skill issue: I think there's no such bug, just a wierd way of compairing weapons. I think the sheet is compairing each weapon without taking into account weapon expertise(BUT taking into account weapon spec, INCLUDING mace spec which gives weapon skill, which means the sheet is using weapon skill but just not weapon expertise?). <br>
When you equip the shiv and "respec" to 2/2 weapon expertise you get a nice dps increase, but if you have the Mace on the offhand, the sheet considers the shiv an upgrade by the same amount with OR without 2/2 weapon expertise(which should improve the shiv but not the S2 OH mace)<br>
<br>
*Edit: Again on the weapon expertise issue on offhand weapons. If I add sword/dagger/fist spec to my talent build(in addition to mace spec), the sheet starts to suggest me to switch to the S2 OH fist or sword, as expected. With 5/5 mace spec and 5/5 sword spec the sheet suggests switching from S2 OH Mace to S2 OH Sword by a big margin(141ap) or S1 OH by 101dps<br>
Now, if instead of going swords I go fists I get the same result, but by a much smaller margin(50dps), again, as expected. In this case the S1 OH Fist doesnt even appear on the suggestion frame and is replaced by S2 OH Dagger(the shiv, from now) which would give me a 30.43ap increase. Fist spec is not good enough to compensate the .1 weapon speed decrease the shiv offers. Fine, I understand<br>
Now, for the wierd thing: IF, while being 5/5 mace spec and 5/5 fist spec, I ADD 5/5 dagger spec(I know, not possible on a real build, but bear with me!) the fists dissapear from the suggestion frame and only the S2 Shiv appears, giving the SAME exact ap increase(30.43) it gave me without 5/5 dagger spec. The only other suggestion is my current oh mace, with a 0 ap increase. Below it: N/A<br>
To narrow things down a bit, I respecced out of fist spec, leaving only mace and dagger spec. The only change is that now, the third suggestion changes from N/A to the S1 Shiv(-2.86ap)<br>
And the last test:removing dagger spec and leaving my build with just 5/5 mace spec(the current situation on my real character) changes the suggestion frame to the situation at mace&amp;fist&amp;dagger spec: 30.43ap increase from the shiv, 0dps from the s2 oh mace[current weapon] and N/A<br>
<br>
If I equip the shiv and respec to dagger&amp;mace spec, I get a dps increase, which means that the only issue is on the suggestion column<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>10DPS with equal gems moving from Netherblade Shoulderpads to Deathmantle Shoulderpads.<br>
<br>
With gloves too, I still lose 1.36 DPS (per the DPS spreadsheet, haven't run it through this one yet).<br>
<br>
So the only thing that would make it worthwhile to drop the whole Netherblade ideal would be grabbing the Bloodsea Brigand's vest, bringing it to a net upgrade of 6.04DPS, while, even then, NB shoulderpads and legs would be 13.43DPS higher, with 9.43DPS upgrade with gloves/leggings and the bloodsea brigand's vest.<br>
<br>
Is it a phenomenal bonus? No. But it's damn hard to get rid of at my current progression level since it's, essentially, free, and deathmantle leggings are still kinda crap.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_472560"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->So, I've been working on some ideas regarding Mutilate, and there are a few questions I need answered before I can move forward.  So if those of you with some experience in the matter would care to assist, I would be greatful.<br>
<br>
1) If one of the two attacks of a Mutilate misses or is dodged, do you still gain 2 combo points?<br>
2) If both attacks miss/are dodged, do you gain combo points?  Is the energy for the attack (mostly) refunded, as is true for backstab/sinister strike/hemo?<br>
3) Is anyone aware of viable cycle propositions for Mutilate other than 4+ CPs with intelligent finisher selection?<br>
<br>
Just so we're clear: I probably will not be integrating Mutilate into the main sheet; rather, I am currently thinking I will make a similar Mutilate sheet with roughly the same frontpage UI, that will only do computations for Mutilate builds.  I will also probably not be updating it as faithfully as I do this one, but I do want to have at least a rough version of the spreadsheet so comparisons can be made.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>With Ruthlessness and only one crit Mutilate, you can get 4 combo points a significant amount of the time. This complicates finding a cycle the most. I think intelligent finisher selection is indeed the best option, following these priorities:<br>
- Slice and Dice whenever it's down, save up energy if it runs out in a couple seconds;<br>
- Rupture whenever it's down, save up energy if it runs out in a couple seconds;<br>
- Envenom if you have enough Deadly Poison stacked to get the full benefit, Eviscerate otherwise.<br>
<br>
You'll want to wait for energy to get back-to-back Ruptures and to fit two Mutilates in the Find Weakness uptime (10 seconds, so only 100 energy regen). One generally only gets to use Envenom/Eviscerate after a Ruthlessness proc + crit Mutilate. Depending on gear it might be a better idea to just Mutilate a second time instead of dumping combo points in those finishers. I have two pieces T4 and two pieces T5, so I try to stick to 4-5s,4-5r,(4e),4-5r as much as possible. It might be worth calculating a shorter cycle 1-3s,4-5r.<br>

</div>I've been working on a Javascript simulator to get an idea of what Mutilate is capable of. It takes your raw stats, allows buff and talent selection and some basic options like whether to keep up Find Weakness, whether the mob is poison immune, and the like. I'm looking into adding at least a basic Armory import for raw stats and maybe implement some trinkets before calling the simulator fit for consumption.

		<div id="post_message_473221"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I raided as 41/20 mutilate until the 2.1 patch, then switched swords (because mutilate was just clearly far inferior at that point).<br>
<br>
4combo point rule is a good one.  Keep SnD up always, envenom when at 4-5 combo points and 5 deadly stacks AND you have a enhance shaman to steal stormstrike from and preferably 2piece t5(massive huge 4800+ envenoms possible).  Rupture when you dont have max stacks of deadly.  The occasion is rare when you dont need to snd or rupture and can't envenom..but if it does happen, evic might be applicable but I never really tried to figure out if that's efficient or not.  I did that with a 1.6 speed offhand.  Find weakness is super important, if I needed to do a 3point to keep it up I'd try to make it be a SnD rather than a rupture/envenom.<br>
<br>
I have absolutely zero mathematical evidence to support the above, just a lot of raid practice and testing.  The above maximized what I was able to do.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_473349"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->The effective damage of Envenom is the amount you see flashing by on your screen, minus the opportunity cost of having to refresh Deadly Poison. In a formula:<br>
<br>
Envenom = Vile Poisons * Rank * (180 + 0.03 * AP - 15 * RefreshTime), where<br>
Vile Poisons = 1 to 1.2 depending on talents;<br>
Rank = the number of combo points or deadly poison doses, whichever is lower;<br>
AP = your attack power;<br>
RefreshTime = MutilateTime / (1 + MutilateTime / OffSpeed) / Improved Poisons, where<br>
MutilateTime = average time in seconds between Mutilates<br>
OffSpeed = the attack time of your offhand weapon<br>
Improved Poisons = 0.3 to 0.4 depending on talents.<br>
<br>
For example, with 3000 AP and Tracker's Blade (1.5 speed) in offhand, using 5-point Envenom assuming Mutilate every 6 seconds:<br>
<br>
RefreshTime = 6 / (1 + 6 / 1.5) / 0.4 = 3 seconds<br>
1.2 * 5 * (180 + 0.03 * 3000 - 15 * 3) = 1350 damage non-crit.<br>
<br>
A 5-point Eviscerate would deal 1045 + 0.15 * 3000 = 1495 damage, modified by armor (897?). If you had only three Deadly Poison stacked, Envenom would deal 810 effective damage. So you see, there may be situations where the one is better than the other. Whether that situation occurs often or not is another matter.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_473924"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I raided as mutilate for a long time before i went to combat daggers, then to swords.<br>
<br>
Mutilate is the most unpredictable build there is, i dont think there is a real "rotation" to it. Its simply a game of keeping SnD up, Find Weakness up, and Rupture up as much as possible while throwing in Envenoms where you see fit.<br>
<br>
By my calculations rupture is always better then envenom due to energy cost mostly.<br>
<br>
Heres basically what you could use, but im not sure its ideal:<br>

		<div id="post_message_474773"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->So, when researching an unknown proc, it's usually best to do it with a single weapon or with two weapons of the same speed.  However, since we already know a bit about how Tsunami Talisman works, it's probably okay to use and two weapons you want, and to use all the combo-point generating moves you want.  However, I'm a little iffy on how finishers work with procs, so I'd hold off on using any.<br>
<br>
As for how to actually analyze data: easiest way is probably to just take a /combatlog of your test and post it to savefile (or wherever), at which point I'll grab it and run my analysis programs over it.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Aye, you should only use Envenom as the last finisher of a fight.  Thing is, that's much much more than most people seem to think.  The vast majority of trash fights go:<br>
<br>
Garotte, Shiv, S'n'D, SS to 5 points, Envenom, move to next mob.<br>
<br>
Using Shiv at the start there to build the DP stack while letting the tank get an aggro head start.<br>
<br>
On tougher trash there might be time for a few CP of Rupture in the middle.  But for anything other than boss fights, I'd say Envenom can and should make up 33 - 50% of all your finishers.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_475379"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Just finished a small test, 55 mins hitting a servant(1000 hits aprox). Not a big sample but maybe useful in some way. Conditions:<br>
a) Full hit gear:no misses(wasn't sure of the amount of hit I needed for this)<br>
b) Just dragonstrike unenchanted on mainhand. No haste effects at all<br>
c) No specials used, just autoattack. Evasion&amp;Talisman of the horde&amp;Blind+Bandage used from time to time<br>
<br>
There may be some data "corruption" from a shaman that  came by to hit the mob and had dragonstrike equipped, guess it's easy to just remove his damage from the log.<br>

<br>
Took a glance on the log file and saw some interesting stuff. First of all:only 4 haste procs in the first 7mins, just bad luck with RNG I guess.<br>
After that:<br>
9/12 15:11:27.125  You gain Haste.<br>
9/12 15:11:37.093  Haste fades from you.<br>
9/12 15:11:40.812  You gain Haste.<br>
9/12 15:11:50.765  Haste fades from you.<br>
9/12 15:11:52.781  You gain Haste.<br>

That's five instances where the buff lasts longer than 10 seconds.  There may be others which I didn't catch by eye.  Unless you had multiple lagspikes of more than 5 seconds' duration, I think it's safe to say that the proc can refresh itself.  That means that any internal cooldown is less than the duration of the proc itself and is unlikely to be significant.<br>
 <br>

		<div id="post_message_475462"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Analysis of the dragonstrike log:<br>
<br>
44 uptime periods, including 5 periods 15 seconds or longer, the longest being the 29 sec uptime at 15:22:52.656.  Hence, at least 50 procs actually occurred, and there is no internal cooldown.<br>
<br>
There were 1272 total swings; the proc rate (assuming 50 procs) thus lies between 2.86% and 5.00%, which equates to being between .64 and 1.11 PPM.  Note that this does not take into account the new findings regarding reduction of proc rate with haste effects.<br>
<br>
On the whole: still seems to be the same proc as on live.<br>
<br>
Regarding hit: when single-wielding, the amount of hit required to never miss a Servant is extremely low.  There are some uncertainties in the exact formula, but it is certainly true that 4% hit will be sufficient, and there's a good chance you don't actually need any at all.<br>
<br>
Regarding internal cooldowns: Typically they're measured from start of proc to start of proc.  The fact that you had refreshing procs indicates that if an internal cooldown exists, it is 5 seconds or less.  Since we have no evidence of internal cooldowns shorter than the length of the proc existing, it is therefore generally assumed that this means there is, in fact, no internal cooldown.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Uptime is pretty similar between 3.Xs5r and 5s5r, in reality.  While it's true that since you're using smaller finishers, it will not proc every time, it's also true that since your cycle is shorter, the uptime% is higher when it *does* proc.  In fact, the only reasons 3.Xs5r and 5s5r don't have *exactly* the same uptime on average is that 3.Xs5r will lose a second here and there due to overlapping procs.  So there's really no strong selection pressure towards 5s5r purely because of Ashtongue uptime reasons.<br>
<br>
Why you *might* see a shift towards 5s5r from Ashtongue is that it provides you with a significant amount of crit; and given enough crit/AP/armor penetration, it is possible for 5s5r to pass the more compressed cycles in damage output - see post 653 for an explanation of this phenomenon.<br>
<br>
On a related note: I noticed while looking at this that there's a slight glitch in the Ashtongue calculations which is going to make it underestimate the value of crit for compressed cycles slightly (for instance, it's showing 66% uptime with my current gear when it should be showing more like 68%). I will be updating this model in a future release to get a little better accuracy.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>The only thing you need to be careful of, is whether a refreshed proc actually procced 3 or more times instead of just 2.  Tracking the duration may not always tell you if a proc refreshed twice.<br>
<br>
For example: (fictional proc that lasts 15 secs)<br>
Time 0 sec - Proc gain<br>
Time 5 sec - Proc refresh<br>
Time 10 sec - Proc refresh<br>
Time 25 sec - Proc ends<br>
<br>
You wouldn't know it refreshed twice unless you were actually watching the proc on the screen.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Yeah, that's kind of disappointing, though, I would argue, not particularly surprising.  The rogue rings for all the lower reps are terrible, why should the exalted one be any different?<br>
<br>
That said, it's still probably the #3 ring option - even if it only procs once every 2min, it still matches Ring of Lethality.  But it's certainly well short of Stormrage Signet Ring, and appears likely to be inferior to Ring of Deceitful Intent as well.  So while disappointing, it's not totally useless, either, if you've had bad luck with the BT rings.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_476189"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->hi guys,<br>
<br>
I have a real dumb question... but well, there are no dumb q's, just dumb answers <br>
and because of the new-thread-rules, this was the best thread i can ask this questions. and hell yes, i read the threads and i did not found an answer to this specific problem. excuse me, if have overlooked something...<br>
<br>
i've just been combat dagger for a few weeks, since I geht Vashj's Fang. from this point on, I really sucked at dps. I worked out the spreadsheed to get the optimal cycle to use. i did it there (boss only of course, trash is a other thing ^^), but I did about 3-5% less damage (#3 before (16-45 with dragonstrike + S2 OH-sword + both specs), #12 with daggers (classic 15-41-5). on tidewalker, lurker, karathress.. all nearly just as well to test dps as each other. equipment was nearly the same. spreadsheet told me just about 20 total dps less with daggers than with mace/sword.<br>
<br>
yesterday we started raiding with 4 rogues in ssc, i was the (un)lucky one, who doesnt get WF totem, because i was the only dagger-rogue, the others were all sword or mace/sword. Reason: "Sword rogues does have a huge (numbers like 2.000.000 times appeared ^^) more benefit than dagger rouges from windfury". I argued with "in the end it's for all specs nearly the same... on lower weapons it procs less, but does more dmg, on faster weapons it procs more, but does less dmg. wf is an +dmg of ~20% of whitedmg to the total dmg, regardless of spec." nobody believed me, so i had just 5% crit from an feraldruid, the other three rogues had imp BS + WF totem all the time.<br>
<br>
now, we wiped on hydross (no comments pls, i know myself that those were dumbass-wipes, not really dmg or heal-related...) several times. raidleader whispered me, asking me if i may respec, because i were #12, a few % behind every other rogue. i said "hey, look at the support of the others, than look on my support, than ask again if you want." result: i was switched with the worst equipped (S2-MH+OH-sword-)rogue on the other grp. result of that: i did 1% more dmg than the tries before, but was always fighting on #9 and #10 of dmgmeter with this rogue (who did then ~2% less dmg than before).<br>
<br>
a few wipes later (i yet don't know what was going on this evening ^^) we all hat to repair our equipment, so i decided to respec to mace/sword. so I did, we had another dump wipe, but then this sucker went down, #1 was our best equipped rogue, #2 a warlock, #3-5 the other 3 rogues, I was #5 with just 1% behind #4, and that without having WF + Imp BS (I had the honor to be the badass rogue who I was at the start again...). later on Lurker it was exactly the same chart on damagemeter.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now a few thougths:<br>
<br>
- were the others right with there meanings of WF, that it is much much much better for non-dagger-rogues?<br>
<br>
- does dagger really is that bad in raids? i cannot believe this, because if i look to armory, I can find many rogues who are daggerspecced, even in BT/MH.. i also know, it is suboptimal for fights which has a shitload of movement, but THAT much? i don't get it why i was THIS far behind the others.<br>
i use recount with 200y combatlogrange, so i can have a look at every skills everyone used. hydross is immune to poison + rupture, so everyone's using eviscerate if they don't know what to do with their combopoints. because of the cost of backstab of 60 instead 40 energy, i can do less eviscerates than the others, of course. but their eviscerates did just about 15k dmg more than my eviscerates, what cannot be the HUGE lack of less damage i did (i talk about the 2-3 trys a HAD the WF debuff, just for clarification). so wtf is going on with daggers in scc?^^ i cannot say that i'm playing bad, i used haste pot on every cd, snd was (of course) always on, BF + AR + Bloodlust Brooch on every CD on the adds... i really don't know what I could have done better :-|<br>
<br>
any suggestions?<br>

</div>No.  Up until the recent WF nerf, they would have been right.  WF used to proc off instants, meaning that sword rogues get large heavy-hitting procs from their instants while dagger rogues get small procs.   <br>
<br>
That behaviour has now changed, and both builds should see similar benefits from WF.  If anything, dagger rogues should see fractionally more benefit due to the (flat) AP bonus on the larger number of WF procs.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>No. This used to be true, but since the WF hotfix, dagger rogues actually benefit just slightly more than sword rogues.  It's all but equal, but if you want to be technical, dagger rogues do gain a bit more.<br>

</div>Dagger spec is pretty gimpy for raids, in general.  That said, Hydross is actually a pretty good fight for dagger rogues, given that 2 of the 3 advantages of sword spec do not apply (see post 490 for details of my theory of how swords beat daggers).  So while I'd expect sword rogues to beat dagger rogues on Hydross, it shouldn't be by the margin you seem to be finding.<br>
<br>
If I had to guess, I would say that you're probably having positioning issues on the adds and are wasting energy trying to get it.  It's also a common mistake to have SnD gaps with daggers while changing targets frequently.  But past that, I couldn't say.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_476364"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I'm a dagger rogue, although I only recently started to inform myself on thread such as this one, I was always instinctivly succesfull at beeing #1 or less then 0.5% from the #1.<br>
<br>
On fight such as Hydross, I usually skip on doing Eviserate and just keep on doing backstab till I need to refresh SnD. Backstab crits at 30% more then eviserate and does more damage (since I don't have aggression and imp evis)<br>

		<div id="post_message_476659"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->It's not going to affect real DPS, as no mechanics change is actually being made.  However, the spreadsheet models are going to need to be updated, which will change the relative value of certain stats and abilities.<br>
<br>
Of note, the valuations in this spreadsheet will be affected in the following ways:<br>
<br>
1)The power of all PPM effects will go down somewhat, including, notably: Dragonspine Trophy and Mongoose enchant (along with Madness of the Betrayer, BS maces, The Bladefist, Rod of the Sun King, etc.)<br>
<br>
2) The value of haste rating will drop somewhat.  Currently, the model is that haste rating increases both direct damage done, and also increases proc time which will increase damage further.  With this change, haste rating will still increase the direct damage done but will *decrease* proc uptime, which will yield a smaller damage return.<br>
<br>
In terms of actual in-game effects: I think the only difference is that if you're not using any flat +AP activated trinkets, it is now understood to be optimal to use AR separately from activated haste buffs (Blade Flurry, Heroism, Haste Pots, etc.) rather than at the same time.  It's not going to make a *ton* of difference, but it'll buy you a little extra proc uptime.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Hell, I'm not even 100% convinced yet that proc rates adjust with haste effects. There are still conflicting results and it's a bit early to conclude anything.<br>
<br>
As far as how much it would affect our models if this turned out to be true -- well, in the case of DST, not actually very much. Using a model I cooked up in a spreadsheet of my own with my gear as the basis, DST uptime comes out to 27.85% if hastes increase PPM, and 23.43% if hastes don't increase PPM. Note that this assumes the 20-second internal cooldown from the upcoming patch.<br>
<br>
The first number is calculated using the same method as your spreadsheet, by figuring a number of procs per second from the total number of attacks per second, then taking (Duration*PPS)/(Cooldown*PPS + 1). The second number was calculated by modifying the procs-per-second formula:<br>
<br>
((1 - MHMiss - MHDodge) + (1 - OHMiss - OHDodge) + (1 - SPMiss - SPDodge) * MHSpeed / SPSpeed) / 60<br>
<br>
This assumes DST is 1 PPM, regardless of the speed of your attacks. Thus, you get 1 PPM from your main hand times the fraction of MH attacks that actually land, plus the same from your offhand. Finally, from special attacks that land, you get 1 PPM times the ratio of main hand [base] speed to special attack speed (for this you need to know approximately how often, in seconds, you perform specials). Then divide by 60 to get procs-per-second.<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
If it weren't for the internal cooldown, the effect would be larger, I suppose. I repeated the same calculation for Mongoose (in the middle of typing up this post) and the main hand's Mongoose uptime was reduced from 46% to 25%. The loss of agility is approximately 25.<br>
<br>
(edit) Oops, screwed up that Mongoose calc. It actually went down to 35%, with a drop of about 13 agility. Still rough when combined with the effect on the OH. Still, if that thread is to be believed, it's not like these are nerfs going in...we've just been modeling it wrong all along.<br>
<br>
(edit 2) Perhaps I've royally screwed something up, but it really doesn't look like the effect is that big. After completely redoing the calculations in my spreadsheet, my DPS decreased from 1415.02 to 1397.02 (a difference of 18).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I, on the other hand, feel like it would make more sense that the proc rate on instant attacks <i>weren't</i> modified by haste procs. However, that's what experimentation is for. <br>
<br>
In the meantime, what I can do is to compare the two models and see what the difference really is. So I've been heavily refining my spreadsheet over the course of the day to bring it in line with the theory that haste does not change the effective PPM of a PPM-based proc. After all my modifications, I equip a Dragonspine Trophy in place of my Bloodlust Brooch (in reality, I don't have a DST, but this is just for the sake of argument). My DPS is given as 1362.45.<br>
<br>
Now, I modify the spreadsheet to assume that special attacks suffer a penalty to their proc rate on PPM enchants while under the influence of haste effects. I check my DPS again. It is down to 1357.14.<br>
<br>
For the sake of argument, I now equip a Shadow-Walker's Cord in place of Socrethar's Girdle. My DPS now increases to 1375.64 (if special attacks aren't penalized, it's 1381.06). Then I swap in a Belt of One-Hundred Deaths and it increases to 1376.83 (1381.64). Belt of Deep Shadow makes it 1376.42 (1381.23).<br>
<br>
In the end, I don't think there's actually that much of a difference whether you model it with special attacks getting penalized or not. Obviously we want to be as accurate as possible with our models, so it will be nice to know for sure, but all in all the total error is not that major.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_476933"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I agree that it doesn't make a whole heck of a lot of difference in terms of DPS; however, even small net changes in DPS can have significant effects on stat weighting.  Consider, for example, the discussion I give of inaccuracies of the original rogue spreadsheet in post 619.  The basis of my argument was that in practice one had 210 more available energy than the sheet was modeling for over the course of a 7 minute fight.<br>
<br>
Now, in terms of actual DPS, 210 energy is 3.5 backstabs, so maybe 4k total damage.  Which, over a 7 minute fight, is under 10 DPS - barely over 1%, and not a big deal.  So in terms of estimating your actual damage output, it was fine.<br>
<br>
However, consider the effect on the value of, say, a talent point in lethality under this change.  Since Lethality only affects your yellow damage, the amount of damage you get from a point in Lethality increases by 5% when you move from the spreadsheet model to the real scenario.  Meanwhile, a talent point in, say, precision, still yields exactly the same amount of damage either way, while the value of a talent point in, say, murder, is going to increase by about 2%.  So even though ones overall damage changed by barely 1%, the relative value of stats can easily change by up to 5% in this example.  Now, admittedly, 5% still isn't a *lot*, but when you consider that, for instance, the value of agi and hit will be within 10% of each other after the Dragonspine nerf, suddenly changes on the order of 5% look like they could really change what your optimal gear is, even if they don't directly affect your damage that much.<br>
<br>
I admit this is to some extent splitting hairs, but I do think it's important to note that even reasonably small differences in damage can signify larger changes in equipment selection.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_476947"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Doesn't it matter very little?  Even if instants aren't affected by the normalization...doesn't that only significantly change items like say.....warp-spring coil(even then it shouldn't)?  If an item has an internal cooldown and a PPM the few extra instant attacks in the midst of all the auto attacks shouldn't hold that large a part of whether a PPM procs faster or slower.  I guess maybe something like a heroic strike could be affected...but a sinister strike has nothing to do with haste rating other than combat potency procs.<br>

		<div id="post_message_476966"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Well, it's not a huge difference, but again, it matters some.  Lets take a look at MH Mongoose as an example.<br>
<br>
Lets assume we're using Talon of Azshara, and are gaining enough energy for a Sinister Strike every 3 seconds (in practice, it takes a bit longer than that, but, as a ballpark figure, it'll work).  Based on the way the normalization works, regardless of haste level, the autoattacks will generate 1 proc per minute.  Now, if instant attacks are *not* affected by Haste, we will have 20 SS per minute, each of which has a 2.7/60 = 4.5% chance to proc, so we gain an extra .9 procs per minute from instant attacks, for a total of 1.9 PPM.<br>
<br>
If, on the other hand, we have, say, 35% haste (which is trivial to get to, particularly with 2/5 T6), our Talon is now effectively speed 2.0, so the proc chance goes down to 2.0/6.0 = 3.33% chance; hence the 20 sinister strikes per minute only generate an additional .667 procs, for a total of 1.667 main hand mongoose procs.<br>
<br>
So, it's a difference of about 14% in the number of MH procs, which equates to an uptime difference of about 11%.  Hence, there's an 11% difference (or so) in the damage contribution of Mongoose - that strikes me as relatively significant.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_477267"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Analyis of Tsunami Talisman data:<br>
<br>
Shortest time between procs: 45.187 seconds, occurring twice.<br>
Number of crits that occur at least 45 seconds after last proc: 443.<br>
Total procs: 45<br>
Proc rate thus lies between 7.3 and 13.0 percent.<br>
<br>
Now, what I have in the spreadsheet is 10% proc rate, 40 second internal cooldown.  From this data, it looks like more than a 45 sec internal cooldown.  So either this data set is flukishly devoid of procs between 40 and 45 seconds (as in, there were 92 crits between 40 and 45 seconds after last proc, and no procs), or it's been nerfed slightly, or I have the cooldown a bit wrong on live.  I'd say the third is most likely, but if people want to do additional testing I'll certainly crunch the data.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>The effekt of +skill on hit/miss is nailed down.<br>
+skill lowers the basemisschance for mobs. In a sense you can say it will provde hit because those are complementary.<br>
If you figet a boss (or lvl73 mob):<br>
- It is linear for skills from 350 to 354 and from 355 on, but with different slopes<br>
- There is a pronounced jump when going from 354 skill to 355 skill.<br>
(The change of slope happens if the difference of Mobdefense and your weapon skill is &gt;10. <br>
So +skill is not a big deal if you only fight mobs between your level and up to two levels higher.<br>
But as soon as you hit bosses you get a 3% decrease in miss <b> if you have +5skill or more</b>)<br>
<br>
And  of the converted skillrating only whole numbers are used: <br>
INT( (rating1+rating2+rating3+....) * 52/203 )<br>
Eg. +15 skillrating nets you ony +3 skill instead of the converted 3.8.<br>
<br>
For the details look at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081109224444/http://elitistjerks.com/472228-post533.html" target="_blank">[Rogue/Warrior] Weapon Skill Adjustment Discussion</a> and the whole thread there.<br>
<br>
For total weapon skill of 355 or more the spreadsheet does provide the correct answer,<br>
but expressd as gaining +hit instead of lowering basemiss. Does not matter in the end.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_477602"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Regarding weapon skill: <br>
<br>
Assuming you have at least 355 weapon skill, the sheet should be reasonably accurate.  Since the effect of weapon skill on dodge isn't totally pinned down yet, I can't say for sure whether they're totally accurate.  But they should be relatively close.<br>
<br>
I've been debating with myself whether to update the model to give correct damage numbers under 355 skill.  On the one hand, this would give a more accurate damage number; on the other hand, the nonlinearities would cause some inaccuracies in the gear-comparison.  Is there a concensus regarding whether people would rather see the dps number more accurate, or the gear comarisons/recommendations more accurate?<br>
<br>
Regarding AP/Crit summary:<br>
<br>
Yes, I'd like to add such a thing (and probably an HP/Dodge summary as well); I haven't yet decided whether this should be the time-averaged buff stats used in the damage calculations, or the base stats as they would appear on your character sheet.  I can see value in both.<br>
<br>
The ultimate goal is to compress all useful information onto as few sheets as possible.  I would eventually like to see the information on the buffs sheet and the set bonus sheet displayed somewhere on the front page, such that there would be only two pages that one would ever need to look at (Talents_Equipment and Advanced Settings).  And on those pages it would have all adjustable parameters (gear/talents/buffs), stat summaries, gear comparisons, next-stat values, the works.  The trick is figuring out where to put everything, as the front page is already quite full.  Again, if people have suggestions, let me know.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>1) Absolutely, on mobs that are affected by Murder. In places like SSC/TK, where mobs of the mobs are affected, it's a great talent.<br>
<br>
2) Not really, it all depends on the type of mob being attacked. In Hyjal/BT, Murder becomes less valuable because of the lack of vulnerable mobs.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<!-- message -->
		<div id="post_message_477796"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->So, first off: the sheet assumes that all mobs are murderable, which, while certainly true of many mobs in SSC and TK, it is not true of all of them; notably, Hydross, Void Reaver, and Al'ar are excluded.  Additionally, Vashj and Kael both have adds that are not effected by murder.  So Murder isn't quite 100% universal even in SSC and TK.  Once one moves *past* SSC/TK, the value of Murder drops somewhat; not a single enemy in Hyjal is murderable, and only about half of BT is.<br>
<br>
That said: on the mobs that murder effects, it is point-for-point a pretty strong talent.<br>
<br>
Running the actual numbers versus Lethality:<br>
<br>
Murder increases your total damage output - white, yellow, poison, everything - by 1% per point.  Lethality only increases the damage you do with yellow attacks.  Yellow attacks typically comprise about 1/3 of ones damage; hence, in order for Lethality to match the contribution of Murder (on those mobs affected by both), a point of Lethality would need to increase your yellow damage by about 3%.<br>
<br>
Lethality, mechanically speaking, increases the damage done by your critical strikes by 3% (the first point takes them from 200 -&gt; 206%, a 3% increase).  Hence, if the total damage done by both crits and noncrits is going to increase by 3%, all yellow attacks must crit.  Hence, in order for Lethality to point-for-point compete with Murder on those mobs which are affected, one would basically need to have a 100% crit rate; even with improved backstab that would require a tooltip crit rate of 70%, which isn't really feasible.<br>
<br>
Now, that said, *since* not all mobs are affected by Murder, Lethality doesn't necessarily need to do as much damage against those that are Murderable in order to be worthwhile.  In particular, if one assumes that, say, 2/3 of mobs are Murderable (which is probably a fair assessment of bosses in SSC/TK), then only ~67% of yellow hits need to be crits in order for Lethality to yield the same average damage output - and a 37% crit rate is not out of the range of possibility for a raid-buffed dagger rogue.  So I think there is a legitimate case to be made for Lethality even though Murder does do more damage on the mobs it affects.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<!-- message -->
		<div id="post_message_477812"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->The big difference lies in the fact that Murder applies to all damage, whereas Lethality only applies to crits on specials.<br>
<br>
Suppose that without points in either talent, you do 100 DPS.<br>
<br>
Getting Murder would take you to 102 DPS, that's pretty easy to see.<br>
<br>
Let's look at the best case for Lethality.  If you had 100% to crit with backstab, 2 points in lethality would increase backstab damage by 6% (all BS's are crits, and they change from 200% to 212%).  The increase to your total output then depends on how much of your damage came from crit backstabs before you invested the talent points.  If backstab crits were accounting for more than 1/3 of your damage, lethality would be better than murder.<br>
<br>
I haven't been daggers for a little while, so I don't remember the breakdown, but I want to say that my backstab % was in the high 20's/low 30's, white damage high 50's/low 60's, and the rest rupture/poison/etc.  "Low 30's? Great! Lethality rocks! Right?"  No.  I didn't have 100% to crit, so the portion represented by backstab crits was even smaller, and I had 4/5 lethality already.  It's not like I could add 6% to my backstab output by investing more points.<br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong.  I had lethality and ruthlessness, and no murder, because they worked on all targets equally, but lethality is not a particularly strong talent point for point.  It does increase damage, but not as well as many other talents.<br>

<br>
a) Haste Nerf<br>
b) Dragonspine Nerf<br>
c) New findings on Haste/PPM.<br>
<br>
Findings are pretty interesting; for one, agility does indeed pass hit in terms of total utility per point (at least, by weighted total if not by actual damage output - hit still has the damage edge).<br>
<br>
Additionally, the ranking of the endgame trinkets is as follows:<br>
<br>
1) Dragonspine - 209<br>
2) Ashtongue - 173<br>
3) WSC - 172<br>
4) Madness - 167<br>
5) Tsunami - 157<br>

So Dragonspine is still the best.  It's just not quite as mandatory as it once was.</div>

		<div id="post_message_478023"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Hit still provides point-for-point more damage than agility in purely sustained fights.  However, in terms of weighted average (which includes a slight value for the dodge gained from agility), Agility scores a bit above hit.<br>
<br>
Additionally, agility performs better relative to hit in interrupted fights; as such, while hit may be better in purely sustained fights, in real fights where their are damage interruptions (which includes, for instance, better than half of the 25-man raid bosses in existance), agility may be the better choice (I'm working on a model of this behavior, but haven't come up with one I'm wholly happy with.)<br>
<br>
Finally, those numbers were based off the best possible gear setup - the target endgame gear.  Until one gets there, the relative values of the different trinkets may be difference.  For instance, in my *current* gear (as opposed to the endgame optimal gear), hit is still better than agility, and the trinket ordering is rather different: <br>
<br>
1) Dragonspine - 198<br>
2) Ashtongue - 180<br>
3) Madness - 165<br>
4) WSC - 155<br>
5) TT - 151<br>
<br>
In practice, I suspect practical considerations will outweigh the exact subtleties, specifically:<br>
a) By the time one can get Madness, one is probably close to/already has Ashtongue, which is comparable or better.  So you probably don't bother with Madness.<br>
<br>
b) At the time you have access to them, while WSC is slightly better than TT, they are fairly comparable, so I would advocate the WDF (Whatever Drops First) or WDFAIC (...And Is Cheap) algorithm for deciding which to get.<br>
<br>
c) Amongst BT gems, red gems tend to be more popular than orange gems, and the yellow +hit gem doesn't exist.  So in practice, even if agi is marginally superior to hit, it doesn't matter enough that I'd worry about wrestling Crimson Spinels away from the casters and hunters; hence, regardless of the specifics, you probably wind up socketing everything with Glinting Pyrestones.<br>
<br>
d) Pre-BT, hit is still better, so keep doing what you've been doing.<br>
<br>
Regarding the interplay of DST and Hit, specifically: it was one of the very first discoveries of this sheet that DST dramatically increased the value of hit.  The more general rule is "having powerful procs increases the value of hit".  The reason why hit is king for rogues these days is the fact that we have so many procs: Combat Potency, Poison, Mongoose, DST, Windfury, Sword Spec, etc.  So if you don't have DST (or Mongoose, or Combat Potency, or Windfury, or whatever), the value of hit is going to drop relative to a rogue that does.  The reason why the value of hit is decreasing relative to previous versions of the sheet is based off the new findings regarding PPM effects and haste, plus the fact that DST is a less powerful proc due to the haste nerf and the internal cooldown.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>There's also the fact that quite a few of the end game items have yellow sockets as opposed to red sockets therefore meaning you wouldn't receive socket bonuses on items like Slayer's Chestguard, Insidious Bands, Slayer's Shoulderpads (if making use of the blue socket) and Shadowmaster's Boots if you opted for agi gems over agi/hit.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_478093"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Well, obviously you use yellow gems where you need them for socket bonuses - the rule of thumb is that any socket bonus that can be gotten with only yellow and red gems is worth getting (the only exception that comes to mind is Wastewalker Gloves, and even that one is debatable).  And, certainly, one will need to socket 2-Tier 6 level pieces with yellow/blue gems to get the socket bonus (most likely shoulders + chest).  But anywhere where you don't need the socket bonus, and in any red socket, one can make a case for using Delicate Crimson Spinels.  I believe my endgame optimal gear, neglecting considerations of gem scarcity, involves 4 Delicate Crimson Spinel (one each in T6 gloves, T6 legs, Don Alejandro's Money Belt, and Shadowmaster's Boots).<br>
<br>
However, as I say, in practice, you probably end up gemming even those 4 with Glinting Pyrestones, because the difference is so small that your guild probably benefits more by leaving the Crimson Spinels to the casters + hunters.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>The extra step is done precisely because armor penetration is nonlinear; WSC is modeled as a 1000 armor reduction that's up, say, 25% of the time, rather than a 250 armor reduction that's up 100% of the time, as that more accurately reflects reality.  In truth, Madness of the Betrayer would be more accurately modeled as 300 penetration that's up ~50% of the time rather than ~150 armor penetration.  I do not do so for two reasons:<br>
<br>
a) This becomes a very messy calculation in very short order if you compute every armor penetration proc seperately, and<br>
b) As it's a smaller armor decrease, the nonlinearity has less of an effect.<br>
<br>
Yes, all of them actually have the same effect - they reduce armor.  And the sheet models them all the same way - they reduce armor.<br>

2) Critproc AP is defined as "AP from procs that work the way TT and Hourglass do".  So any trinket in the future that procs by a different pattern wouldn't use that column, because it wouldn't be "critproc AP" the way I've defined it.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<!-- message -->
		<div id="post_message_478639"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->So, couple of things:<br>
<br>
1) I was doing some testing this evening on live, and as an incidental benefit of what I was *actually* testing, took some data on Tsunami Talisman.  Out of 59 total procs, the spacing never was under 46.281 seconds.  So the values on test would appear to not be changed - the spreadsheet was just using slightly wrong values.  I'll add it to the list of things to fix.<br>
<br>
2) What I was *actually* testing is the proc rate of 4/5 T5.  Offhand, the answer seems to be "about .5 PPM with no internal cooldown" - I'll need to take a larger data set at some point to confirm that, but that's my best guess at this stage.  If that is, in fact, true, that means that the spreadsheet is currently overvaluing that set bonus somewhat for sword rogues and by quite a bit for dagger rogues.  Again, added to the list, pending confirmation.<br>
<br>
3) Re: Trash DPS scenario.  I haven't actually run any numbers on this, so trust the following assertion only assuming you trust my gut instincts:<br>
<br>
As a general rule, you want to keep SnD up as much as humanly possible.  So if there are additional mobs to be killed on hand (i.e. if you're killing a pack of stuff and there's more stuff left in the pack), I typically refresh the SnD.  If, however, there's no further mobs in the pack (or the next DPS target is far away), I'll generally throw the Evis if it's 3 points or larger, *or* if I have energy for it but not a SS (i.e. my current energy is 35-39).<br>
<br>
Again, no real theory backing that, that's just my instinct.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_479649"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Re: Shoulders.  Thanks<br>
<br>
Re: Belts.  Don Alejandro's and Belt of One-Hundred Deaths are extremely close in terms of rating by the spreadsheet (in the current version I'm using, which has about half of the changes for 0.7.8 in it, they score within .2 AP of each other assuming late-BT quality gearing).  So, ultimately, it's a matter of personal preference - subject to a couple of assumptions.<br>
<br>
First off, it should be noted that the exact behavior of weapon skill on dodge has not been finalized.  As such, it's entirely possible that the Vashj belt is under- (or over-) valued in the current incarnation of the sheet.  So when and if an answer is ultimately reached for that issue, the answer may change here.<br>
<br>
But, for the sake of argument, lets assume, for the moment, that Weapon Skill is modeled correctly.  At this point, the decision - for me at least - comes down to two things.  Interrupted combat, and rounding.<br>
<br>
1) Interrupted combat.  The sheet, as has been noted, assumes endless uninterrupted combat.  In practice, very few boss fights exhibit uninterrupted combat; for instance, in all of SSC/TK, there are really only two fights that have even the potential for uninterrupted sustained DPS:  Tidewalker (assuming no graves) and Void Reaver (depending on your strategy).  And, looking through Hyjal/BT, they're not really any better; you have Gorefiend, Bloodboil, Anetheron, Kaz'rogal... and that's about it.  Moreover, you'll note that many of *those* fights are fairly short, and thus are poorly modeled by "endless".  So when you add it all up, most fights shorter and/or more interrupted than the spreadsheet models.<br>
<br>
The question, then, is what effect this has an actual DPS.  Well, interrupted fights have a number of effects; the major one, of course, is that your cycles necessarily change.  Additionally, it increases the value of effects with cooldowns.  But the other fairly fundamental thing it does is that it change the ratio of white to yellow damage; whenever you're in a situation where your energy is regenerating but you're not autoattacking, you're going to do more yellow damage relative to the amount of white damage.  This will thus relatively decrease the value of hit, which only affects white damage; hence, between two otherwise comparable items, it is generally superior to wear the one that has less hit on it.<br>
<br>
With regards to the specific belt situation:<br>
<br>
Don Alejandro's has no inherent hit on it, so will gain only what it gets from gems - most likely 5 or 10 hit rating.<br>
<br>
Belt of One-Hundred Deaths has 25 weapons skill rating = 6 weapon skill = .6% hit = ~9.5 hit rating on it inherently, plus whatever additional you gain from socketing (which is almost certainly nonzero).  Additionally, some of it's benefit is also from -enemy dodge, which also helps white damage more than yellow.<br>
<br>
Hence, Belt of One-Hundred Deaths is more of a white-damage-friendly belt, while Don Alejandro's is more of a yellow-damage-friendly belt; hence, in interrupted scenarios, the advantage tends to go more toward Don Alejandro's.<br>
<br>
It might be noted, however, that Heroism - particularly multiple Heroisms per fight - can tip the balance more towards white damage, as can haste pots.  As such, there is a reasonable argument to be made for favoring white damage more than yellow.  And in case you were wondering, yes, I am planning to add "drink a haste pot every 2 minutes" and "give me N heroisms every 10 minutes" as options to the buff sheet at some point; I just haven't gotten around to it yet.<br>
<br>
So, to summarize this point: there is a reasonable case to be made that Don Alejandro's will perform somewhat better in interrupted-damage scenarios than Belt of One-Hundred Deaths.  The real answer here, of course, would be to have both belts and rotate depending on the fight.  But that's not always possible.<br>
<br>
2) Rounding.  For reasons of continuity, the sheet doesn't quantize to integers like the game does.  As such, for fine-level decisions like comparing these two belts, it may be worth considering your position relative to various roundoff cutoffs.  As an example: 25 weapon skill rating is modeled in the sheet as 6.34... weapon skill, when in reality, it's only 6.  As such, In terms of actual performance in real-world scenarios, the Vashj belt is overvalued by the spreadsheet by roughly 1/3 of a point of weapon skill, or about 2.3 AP.  Throw in the fact that, with end-game optimal gear, Don Alejandro's puts you better positioned relative to the roundoff points of Vitality for both Agi and Sta (trust me, it does), and you'll find that in a real world scenario, Don Alejandro's gains a couple of AP relative to the Vashj belt due to these roundoffs.  Again, not a major deal, but for two belts as closely spaced as these, every little bit matters.<br>
<br>
In conclusion: it really is a matter of personal preference. For the reasons above (and some other, even more vague ones, like how hard it may or may not be to convince your guild leadership to let you socket a Vashj drop with BT gems relative to a Hyjal drop), I do have a slight inclination towards Don Alejandro's.  However, I could easily see someone having the reverse preference; there's really no wrong answer between these two.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Well, detailed analysis from a screenshot is hard, but here's my take on the matter:<br>
<br>
1) I may be a bit off in terms of what Tidewalker's armor is.  This comes back to my desire for a more systematic study of how much armor various bosses have.<br>
<br>
2) There will always be a certain amount of variance in these things anyway.<br>
<br>
3) As the fight was not endless, it is likely that some of your cooldowns and whatever were able to be used more than is modeled by this sheet (in particular: AR is a 5 min cool, so if you're able to use it, for instance, twice in 7 minutes, that's going to make something of a difference).<br>
<br>
4) A member of your group mentions in chat that he missed the heroism.  Presumably this means heroism was used, and, as you were never graved, you probably did benefit from it, which would increase your DPS by a nontrivial amount.<br>
<br>
Fundamentally, though, even given 1-3 above, I am somewhat concerned about this discrepancy, as it does seem overlarge.  However, there's not a lot I can do to debug it just from a screenshot; a combatlog, or WWS, or even a Recap, would be more useful to me.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_479979"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->A quick followup on the topic of heroism (and Blood Lust, but since I'm alliance, I'm going to use the term "Heroism" throughout), which relates both to my previous post and the earlier discourse on belts:<br>
<br>
I have performed some rough estimates on the effects of heroism, and here is what I've concluded:<br>
<br>
a) Heroism is a reasonable source of damage output; in particular, each heroism increases the dps estimate by around 20-25 DPS, depending on your gear level.  So if, for instance, you got a one heroism in an 8 minute fight, that by itself would account for nearly 1/3 of the difference between the sheet and your actual measurement.<br>
<br>
b) However, despite the contributions to DPS, Heroism and Haste Pots do not overwhelmingly increase the value of hit; in particular, even with drinking a Haste Pot every 2 minutes, and getting 3 heroisms in a 5 minute fight (which is about the upper limit on reasonable number of heroism to include), Belt of One Hundred Deaths pulls ahead of Don Alejandro's by less than 2 AP, although it does put Glinting gems back ahead of Delicate ones.  Hence, I'm of the opinion that the earlier analysis regarding interrupted fights and roundoff threshholds still stands, and that the benefits of Heroism is insufficient to outweigh them.  Your mileage may vary, of course, but, personally, barring significant new findings in the realm of weapon skill behavior, I'm inclined to say that I would rather have Don Alejandro's than the Vashj belt as my endgame belt.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_480064"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->There's enough fights where there's general AoE damage that I think it's a mistake to discount stamina entirely - while DPS is certainly more important, there clearly exist some amount of DPS that's worth trading for stamina (as a simple example: given the choice betwen 1 AP or 100 sta, which would you take?).  And, personally, given a choice between 2.5 DPS and 120 HP, it seems to me that there's a reasonable case to be made for the 120 HP.  Again: some of you will certainly disagree, and that's fine.  But I'll just say: the weighted total option is in the sheet (and is the default) for a reason.

		<div id="post_message_480110"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->It's true, though I would note that the amount of sta you have in end SSC/TK gear is not really adequate for much of MH/BT... and the point of gearing in end-BT gear is to get ready for Sunwell Plateau, which is an unknown entity at this stage - it could very well be that 10k unbuffed HP (which is about what my ideal gear winds up with) is only marginally adequate for Sunwell.<br>
<br>
But, yeah, you have a valid point in that MH/BT do tend to be somewhat more sta-heavy than gear in previous instances, and running up around 10k by the end of it is pretty straightforward.  But I still maintain that 2.5 DPS (or less) for 120 stamina is not exactly an unreasonable tradeoff even if you already have quite a bit of sta already.<br>
<br>
Again: DPS is certainly more important.  Which is why Sta isn't weighted very heavily (1 sta = .6 AP, meaning something like 1 dps = 3-4 sta).  And while a case could probably be made to lower that further, I'm not sure I buy that it should go to zero.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I know it's not quite aqurate on anything other than level 70, but I like to try and optimize and do the calculation.<br>
<br>
Necklace of the Deep as you guessed seems quite superb especially at level 65 and would like to see just how superb. <br>

The reason I ask for the other slots was that it might be easier to just add some extra once and for all.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>The sockets on the front page were something that Darlal set up, and I honestly haven't given them a lot of thought. I do believe them to be sufficient for everything except necklaces, and there are a couple slots where I think they're even a bit excessive (like, I'm not aware of any 3-socket gloves or bracers.  Or even any 2-socket bracers).<br>
<br>
Specifically regarding Necklace of the Deep: it was actually in the sheet for a couple of months, until I realized that it had been broken + nonfunctional in the sheet for all that time.  Given that in 3 months no one had complained about it, I figured it probably wasn't in high demand and took it out.<br>

</div>Yes, DamageCalcs row 11 is the raw stat value comparisons.  At some point I will probably summarize these as a Next-Stat block on the Advanced page, but in the meantime, yes, that's the place to find them.<br>

</div>Well, I don't think there was any argument that on new content bosses there's a place for stamina (although, 1.0?  dang...)  I think the immediate debate concerned end-BT level gear, which sort of by definition means you're not working on new content anymore.  <br>
<br>
However, I would argue that the entire discussion is to some extent moot, given that it doesn't really change what's optimal.  With the defense weighting being anything between 0 and 1.2 or so, the only slot that changes at all in the endgame gear is, you guessed it, the belt.  There are certainly some changes in margin - that is, how much item A beats item B by (for instance, with a weighting of 1.2, Telonicus is comparable to Choker of Endless Nightmares rather than 20+ points behind).  But, fundamentally, there's not a lot of debate over what's best outside of belts.  And belts, as I've said, really comes down to personal preference more than anything else - as noted, my reasons for preferring Don's Alejandro's has more to do with subtleties not included in the spreadsheet than they do anything else.<br>

</div>Correct.  This sheet is optomized for level 70 rogues fighting level 73 bosses.  Therefore, if you're not at the very least starting Karazhan, what's in this sheet will not be terribly applicable to you.  I mean, it may give a rough ballpark figure, but certainly nothing better than that.  This is pretty much the reason why the itemization stops where it does; there is at least one item for each slot that should be reasonably accessible to a Karazhan rogue, and, as such, there's not a whole lot of reason to add items below that to the sheet.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I find it a bit weird that you guys are talkign about Don Alejandro's Money Belt and Belt of One-Hundred Deaths.<br>
<br>
I just passed on Belt of One-Hundred Deaths because this spreadsheet comfirmed my own comparison with Belt of Deep Shadow. Belt of Deep Shadow is for me just as good as either belt but is dkp free and crafted pretyt much the second you step into SSC. It's also alot better then anything you get before entering SSC so everybody is bound to have this piece of craftwork. In fact there isn't a single belt that scores significantly better then Belt of Deep Shadow according to this spreadsheet.<br>
<br>
Is there any reason you guys completely ignore this Belt of Deep Shadow in your comparisons of it's 2 alternatives?</div>

	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>Me and Aldriana were talking about our respective end-game "want" gear (Which are identical I guess in regards of most things.) With the exception of the belt. <br>
<br>
Deep Shadow is really good though. But for my dream gear I'd want One-Hundred Deaths (Mainly because I mostly play as mutilate.)<br>
<br>
On another note. I've so far put spending my arena points but this week I'll be reaching the cap and nothing else to buy.<br>
So I'm torn between sword or fist. Post-patch Fist+OH Sword would be the best combination I guess?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I've yet to see or compute anything that makes me think first/sword is in any way superior to sword/sword.  In fact, everything I've been able to piece together myself shows it as inferior, and I'm not aware of anything in the patch that would change that.  So, myself, I'd be more inclined to sword/sword, unless I'm missing something important.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Mmm, in my spreadsheet Dons belt is by far the worst belt at my current gear level dropping my dps by 4 over belt of deep shadows which in turn is only 0,1dps behind 100-deaths.<br>
<br>
I also tried plugging in gear from MH and BT without actualy grabbing any tier 6 stuff (I won't soon see that as we're on Kael) and this still remains the same: bels of deep shadows is still better then dons belt although 100-belt overtakes by 1.5 dps now.<br>
Only when I plug in the very best of the best endgear dons bels overtakes deep shadow while 100-belt stays the winner. (EDIT: meh, kinda forgot gems and a few pieces.. don wins in the end over 100 and deep shadow)<br>
<br>
Then again... blizz just HAS to 'fix' Shadow-walker's Cord right? :o<br>
<br>
On another subject.. this spreadsheet puts vile poisons in favour over imp poisons. In practice I find myself running around too often to justify speccing for vile. In an ideal situation (as a spreadsheet) I can see vile being better but in practice where often a deadly stack will wear of I still think imp poison is the better choice.<br>

</div>Well, here's the argument on belts as I see it:<br>
<br>
Either you only care about raw DPS, or you care about the weighted total of stamina + avoidance + DPS.<br>
<br>
In the first case, Belt of One Hundred Deaths does more DPS than Belt of Deep Shadows.  In the second, the high stamina on Don Alejandro's puts it in the lead.  So while Belt of Deep Shadows may have more DPS than Don Alejandro's, if you're worrying about DPS alone you shouldn't be using either.  Fundementally: depending on your exact preferences you can justify using either Don Alejandro's or One Hundred Deaths; but regardless of your exact preferences, Deep Shadows will not be optimal by any reasonable defenition.<br>

</div>So, the sheet prefers vile poisons, simply because... it's modeling endless combat, so issues like the one you raise never enter the equation.  In practice, on a more interrupted fight, you could make a case for imp poison being better.  The general rule of thumb, though, is that if a fight is worth using Deadly Poison at all on, it's probably worth having Vile Poisons rather than Improved, as the faster stacking from Imp Poisons is only going to overtake the extra damage from Vile if the fight is less than 20 seconds or so long, at which point Deadly is sort of a questionable choice in the first place. Also, I would argue that there's very few 20 sec fights where your damage output on the level of poison selection matters.  So, personally, I prefer Vile.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

(Actual numbers vary from 5.7% - 6.1%; these are provided by both Recap and my guild's WWS logs.)  I figure I must be overlooking something obvious, but I can't work out what it is.

				<div style="font-style:italic">First, thank you so much for this site and the sheets.  Sorry for the slightly off-topic post but after looking it seemed this was the best place for questions about the Gear Spreadsheet:<br>
<br>
I got Warpspring Coil last night.  The DPS spreadsheet tells me to replace Romulo's Poison Vial.  The Gear Spreadsheet tells me to bank Bloodlust Brooch.  Why the discrepancy?  I'm 19/42/0.</div>

</div>Well, I hate to just say "because I'm right and they're wrong", so lets see if I can be a little more helpful...<br>
<br>
On any particular item, the two sheets will often disagree on the value of certain items.  The reason for this is that the two sheets have very different models for rogue DPS, and thus have different levels of accuracy for different effects.  On the whole, I believe this sheet to be more accurate than the other (as if I didn't, I wouldn't have bothered to write it).  Ultimately, you need to decide which sheet you trust more.<br>
<br>
In the specific case of RPV: I believe that, on the whole, this sheet tends to value +hit more than the other, due to the fact that I model all procs as procs rather than static bonuses, which thus includes the subtlety "you cannot proc unless you hit", which understandably drives up the value of hit.  This is probably at least some of the difference.<br>
<br>
However, it is also possible that the two sheets have different values for the proc rate on RPV entered; in this case, I can't actually claim with certainty that I have the correct values, as while I have done some rough testing myself, I am not aware of any firm conclusion being reached (or at least, there's no ultimate conclusion found in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080416215952/http://elitistjerks.com/f31/t14375-rogue_mechanics_testing_thread/" target="_blank">http://elitistjerks.com/f31/t14375-r...esting_thread/</a>).  As such, while I believe my estimate of it's proc rate to be in the correct ballpark, it is entirely possible that it is misestimating the amount to some extent, which may explain some part of the discrepancy in the sheets.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I have a question regarding calculation of uptime for trinkes with cooldown:<br>
<br>
Should that not be caluated as<br>

or aequivalent<br>
uptime = (Duration *PPS)/(Cooldown*PPS +1/HPS)<br>
<br>
HPS=total hits/sec. <br>

</div>So, I'm not exactly sure what you're objecting to here, so I'm going to address both things:<br>
<br>
1) With regards to hasted weapon speed consideration: this is currently not modeled in this sheet, as the last revision occurred before the new findings regarding weapon speed and haste.  This update will be in the next version.<br>
<br>
2) With regards to the extra term in the calculations: that is done on the line before.  By "procs per second" I mean "the actual probability that a proc will occur during any given second", which is computed as hits*procrate, in the previous line.<br>

</div>Recap and WWS's overall hit number counts dodges, parries, and blocks as misses.  If you're attacking from behind, as usual, this works out to about 5.5% of attacks missed to these effects.  As such, your miss rate, even without any actual "misses" with show up as 5% or more in many cases.  However, if you look at the detailed breakdown with either program, it will correctly break it down into hits, dodges, etc.<br>
<br>
So: you're probably not actually missing that much.  You're just getting dodged that much, and, alas, there's no good way to fix that.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_484966"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Actually, modeling PPM proc rates and uptime should now be a lot easier. Our two working assumptions, currently, are:<br>
<br>
1) White attacks have dynamically recalculated proc rates for PPM procs, so that over time you get the same average PPM regardless of hastes.<br>
2) Yellow attacks do not dynamically recalculate proc rates for PPM procs; their proc rate is based on the unhasted speed of the main hand.<br>
<br>
Thus we can figure the total PPM and proc uptime as such:<br>
<br>
MH PPM = PPM * (1 - MH Miss% - MH Dodge%)<br>
OH PPM = PPM * (1 - OH Miss% - OH Dodge%)<br>
<br>
SP Proc% = PPM * MH Speed / 60<br>
SP PPM = (60 / SP Speed�*) * SP Proc% * (1 - SP Miss% - SP Dodge%) (which simplifies to ---&gt;)<br>
SP PPM = PPM * (1 - SP Miss% - SP Dodge%) * MH Speed / SP Speed�*<br>
<br>
Total PPM = MH PPM + OH PPM + SP PPM<br>
Total PPM = ((1 - MH Miss% - MH Dodge%) + (1 - OH Miss% - OH Dodge%) + (1 - SP Miss% - SP Dodge%) * MH Speed / SP Speed�*) * PPM<br>
Total PPS = Total PPM / 60<br>
<br>
�*SP Speed is the average number of seconds between special attacks performed (define special attacks as any yellow attack that can cause a proc; Sinister Strike, Backstab, Hemorrhage, Mutilate, Eviscerate, Envenom all count; I'm not 100% if Rupture does or not; Slice and Dice does not). You can either calculate this simply as the energy cost of your special of choice divided by 10, or you can calculate it more exactly by taking the number of specials performed in your cycle divided by the duration of your cycle.<br>
<br>
Now that we have the average number of procs per second, we can calculate uptime for either kind of proc.<br>
<br>
No Cooldown Proc: 1 - (1 - Total PPS)^(Duration)<br>
Cooldown Proc: (Duration * Total PPS) / (Cooldown * Total PPS + 1)<br>
<br>
(edit) Note that we can also account for sword spec and Windfury pretty easily, although the equation becomes a bit muddy. Let's separate it into parts:<br>
<br>
MH PPM = PPM * (1 - MH Miss% - MH Dodge%) * ((1 + Windfury) * (1 + MH SS) + OH SS + SP SS)<br>
Windfury = 20% * (1 - MH Miss% - MH Dodge%)<br>
MH SS = 5% * (1 - MH Miss% - MH Dodge%)<br>
OH SS = 5% * (1 - OH Miss% - OH Dodge%) * MH Speed / OH Speed<br>
SP SS = 5% * (1 - SP Miss% - SP Dodge%) * MH Speed / SP Speed�*<br>
<br>
Keep in mind each type of attack is multiplied by two kinds of chances to attack because first, an attack must land to be able to cause that extr attack, and then that extra attack must land to be able to cause the proc in question.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I'm not sure if you're aware of Excel's stupid powerful iterative calculation feature, but I started using it in my own spreadsheet and found it allowed me to accurately model the haste feedback loop. Basically you can set up a circular reference in some calculation in your spreadsheet, and Excel will give you an error -- then go to the settings dialog to the "Calculations" tab and turn on Iteration and BAM, it recalculates your circular reference down to within a threshold you can specify.<br>
<br>
The only problem I've found is that if you get particularly fancy with it, it can break (at which point you'd need to cut off the circular link at some point so that Excel can figure out a new starting point to recalculate). But I'd think that, based on the way your sheet is set up, it would work without any complaints.<br>
<br>

		<div id="post_message_484988"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->My sense is that macros in Excel and macros in OO aren't compatable, which is why I'm not using them.  That said, the manual-loop method that I'm using works just fine; all I'm saying is that the changes, while they affect the rate of convergeance of the loop, they do not eliminate the need for it.<br>
<br>
Regarding yellow attacks and haste: Yes, I saw those posts.  Here's my counterargument:<br>
<br>
1) Fiery does not seem to reduce in proc rate with haste as the expansion procs do; as such, the fact that it's proc rate on instants is not reduced by haste doesn't mean a whole heck of a lot.<br>
<br>
2) The proc rate of RPV was barely reduced on white attacks by haste; since some procs seems to be reduced and others not, there's no particuar reason to assume that it has to be.  Thus, I would want to see a larger data set showing conclusively that RPV proc rate is reduced by haste before accepting that data.<br>
<br>
3) Hence, the only one of those 3 data sets that I put much faith in at all is the third, which, while it is a reasonable test of a proc who's proc rate has been shown to drop via haste, is still flawed; the data set is far too small to show that there's conclusively a difference.<br>
<br>
So: while I do agree it's more likely, based on that data, that some PPM effects are reduced by haste, I don't think it has been proved beyond reasonable doubt.<br>
<br>
As an additional note: given that some procs exhibit proc reduction rate with haste and some do not, it would probably be worth testing more different procs to classify which do and which do not, which has not been done to the best of my knowledge.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

My armory shows Band of Eternity and Serpentshrine Shuriken where I would normally have Ring of Lethality and Arcanite Steam Pistol for boss fights.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Just a quick query regarding this excellent spreadsheet.  Apologies in advance if this has already been covered elsewhere.<br>
<br>
When I remove sword specialisation, the value of the offhand swords goes up.  This seems a little strange.  Can anyone supply the reason for this?</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>The absolute score goes up.  The relative score goes down.<br>
<br>
Expanding that a bit:<br>
<br>
The scoring values are based off of effective AP; that is, how much AP would provide an equivalent benefit to the stats on the item in question.  Hence, if a talent or gear selection makes a significant difference to the value of one point of AP, the scores can move in some counterintuitive directions.<br>
<br>
Looking, for instance, at the default gear in 0.7.7:<br>
<br>
With the initial talents + gear, the Merciless Gladiator's OH is scored at 519.44.  If we remove sword spec, it goes up to 535.52.  What this means is that the loss of sword spec decreases the value of a point of AP more than it decreases the value of my OH sword.  It doesn't mean that sword spec is bad or any such thing; note that all the other numbers move in the direction you would expect; DPS goes down from 1450.26 to 1370.9, and the relative value of Quickblade to nonsword weapons decreases (Messenger of Fate goes from inferior to Quickblade to a 52 AP upgrade).<br>
<br>
Basically, it's an artifact of the scoring system.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>First off: again, scores are AP, not DPS.<br>
<br>
Secondly: well, we said that we'd need to make up at least 7 AP or so by resocketing.  Per your estimates, we gain ~8 AP per gem.  Hence, we'd need to make up about 9 AP on socket bonuses for it to be worth it.<br>
<br>
Now, if you're stuffing the blue gem in, like, Skulker's Greaves: yeah, sure, it's not going to be worth it.  But generally there's at least a couple of items with halfway decent socket bonuses, so if you can activate two of them, it's usually worth it.<br>

		<div id="post_message_489705"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Sword spec was not nerfed by a noticable amount.  Any difference you're observing is probably observer bias.  Consider:<br>
<br>
In roughly 4 hours in SSC last night, I landed a total of 7367 attacks, of which 362 were sword spec procs.  Hence, 365/7002 = 5.17% of eligible attacks procced - very close to the expected 5.00%.  So sword spec is working the way one would expect right now.<br>
<br>
With the old chain-procs, 5% of those 362 procs would generate another hit - or about 18 additional hits - of which 5% would generate yet another hit - for a total of roughly 19 extra hits.<br>
<br>
19 extra hits out of 7365 total attacks is, roughly speaking, a quarter of a percent difference.  Hence, if you did 1500 DPS before, the sword spec nerf will drop you to... 1496 DPS, aka, barely noticable.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>It's entirely possible that you did have fewer of them on Teron, but, looking at the larger parse for the week:<br>
<br>
On the Wed 26 Sep Anetheron-Gorefiend parse, you had 10632 melee hits, 2101 hemo hits, 10 Ghostly Strikes, 7 kicks, and 2 gouges; of those 10632 hits, an estimated 609 were Sword Spec hits; hence, there were a total of 12143 attacks eligible for SS procs, and 641 total sword spec procs, which works out to a proc rate of 5.28%<br>
<br>
On the Wed 19 Sep Hyjan and BT to Teron parse, you had 12927 melee hits, 2718 sinister strikes, 6 kicks, and 1 gouge; an estimated 695 of the melee hits were SS procs, for a total of 15055 eligible attacks, and 734 total sword spec procs, which works out to a proc rate of 4.88%<br>
<br>
So, over the course of the night, you actually had a *higher* sword spec proc rate this week than last.  So while on any given fight it might be higher or lower, on the night as a whole, it's pretty even.<br>

My only concern with putting in time-averaged raid-buff stats is that the numbers that will generate are numbers that can never and will never appear on your character screen; they're designed to reflect your average over the course of a fight, which means that unless you have absolutely no procs at all going, they aren't anything you will ever actually see.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_490777"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Ah, I see, so it wouldn't be base raid buffed stats. In that case, I would say go with unbuffed.<br>
<br>
I didn't realize you were counting the hit rating box already there as separate. Miss % would be redundant in that case, in my opinion, as it's not something terribly hard to extrapolate from your hit rating. AP, Crit, HP would be good then.<br>
<br>
By the way, something interesting I tried out last night on Mother Shahraz; I decided to go without Dragonspine Trophy (blasphemy I know), since my hit rating was pretty low in SR, and used Ashtongue Talisman and Madness of the Betrayer. I got FA once and my partner rogue (who was using Ashtongue and Dragonspine and more or less gear/SR on par with mine) got FA twice. When the fight ended I was about 5k damage behind him which, considering he lost maybe 10-15 seconds of DPS time from the one extra FA, shows me how significant the DST nerf really was. Just some anecdotal information to throw out there.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Thanks for the correction, that makes the RED still the better choice for me right now.  <br>

<br>
I'd personally like to see hit rating (with % + talents) and possibly haste rating &amp; % with even an option for armor penetration and avg uptime.  I know this is probably a lot, but things that I can't look at on my character sheet in game/wow armory would be nice.  Even Possible weapon skill --&gt; crit and hit vs which mobs.  Meh, I'm probably blowing minds by now, but just be nice to see a plethora of information incorporated into such a great spreadsheet.... *one-stop shopping*<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Agreed, just pointing out that we already can see our base stats, buffed and unbuffed on the sheets, but we only see a %hit instead of hit rating (which for most people is easier to understand).  Also don't show passive haste anywhere or armor penetration.  And tbh, I'm guessing the majority of the rogues using these sheets have some form of weapon skill (hit and crit on bosses), armor penetration or haste and aren't still struggling with karazhan and trying to see if Malcheezan is better than the Emerald Ripper.  Just my guess though...<br>
<br>
<br>
Also, has anyone done the math, or could show me the base math that I could do to find out if the new 20agi &gt; mongoose?<br>
<br>
Reasonably, I'd think that with the "1ppm" system, gettings 1 proc every minute would equal out to 30 agi over the min for that weapon + the attack speed boost (120 agi x 15 secs / 60 secs total = 30agi).  Thing is I usually have mongoose proc and double proc or ever double proc and reproc itself to keep it up on two weapons for a full 30 seconds.  Just wondering others thoughts or testing?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_490930"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->MH Mongoose is still definitely superior to 20 agi.  Offhand is closer, but I'm pretty sure Mongoose still wins.  In any event, I'll be replacing the 15 agi enchant with 20 agi in the next version, which should answer that.<br>
<br>
With regards to stat summaries: what I'm leaning towards at the moment is putting AP/Crit/HP on the front page, and then a  more detailed stat block on the advanced settings page.  Sound like a reasonable option?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Also, perhaps a "white damage" and "yellow damage" scaling meter. Something that can incorporate haste and armor penetration into one collective group.

		<div id="post_message_492063"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->As to Survival Hunter using Expose Weakness, we have one in my guild.  Buffed agility runs 950-1000.  We are an early SSC level guild (i.e. started dropping Lurker, working on Tidewalker, dropped Gruul a few times and about 75% have T4 from High King, never dropped Mags - only tried once, farmed the hell out of Kara) in terms of gear level.<br>
<br>
Given that high agility tends to lend itself to a high crit rate, I'd call Expose Weakness a 100% proc.  Maybe at the lower gear levels it isn't 100%, but I'd surmise as gear improves Expose Weakness from a good Hunter is a constant.  I believe our Hunter was claiming a 35% raid crit rate, if that helps put things into perspective.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I'm surprised you're seeing striking at only 6 AP - for me, it tends to be up around 11-12.  But it's most definitely not 50+ AP, unless there's some hidden mechanic at work that's unknown to me.<br>
<br>
Consider, for instance, the impact of 14 AP on my weapons, which are of speeds 2.7 and 1.5.  To my main hand, 14 AP, which grants 1 DPS, would thus effectively add 2.7 weapon damage to my main hand autoattacks; 2.4 damage to my main hand instant attacks; and 1.5 damage to my offhand attacks.  Since MH damage tends to account for a larger portion of one's damage than OH damage, it should be at least plausible to you that this benefit (2.7/2.4 to MH, 1.5 to OH) is superior to 2 damage to all attacks, particularly when you factor in that the AP would also increase my rupture damage slightly.  As such, it seems fairly clear to me, at least, that 2 weapon damage should be worth less than 14 AP - for a sword rogue, anyway.<br>
<br>
For a dagger rogue, with faster attacks, Striking is presumably worth somewhat more, but even then it would not be in the 50 AP range.<br>

</div>It's not in the sheet because it doesn't make any difference to the calculations this sheet does.  This sheet is modeling sustained combat, in which rupture is superior to eviscerate.  Therefore, no eviscerates are ever used in the damage calculations; hence Improved Eviscerate would make absolutely no difference whatsoever to the calculations it performs.

				<div style="font-style:italic">I'm surprised you're seeing striking at only 6 AP - for me, it tends to be up around 11-12.  But it's most definitely not 50+ AP, unless there's some hidden mechanic at work that's unknown to me.<br>
<br>
Consider, for instance, the impact of 14 AP on my weapons, which are of speeds 2.7 and 1.5.  To my main hand, 14 AP, which grants 1 DPS, would thus effectively add 2.7 weapon damage to my main hand autoattacks; 2.4 damage to my main hand instant attacks; and 1.5 damage to my offhand attacks.  Since MH damage tends to account for a larger portion of one's damage than OH damage, it should be at least plausible to you that this benefit (2.7/2.4 to MH, 1.5 to OH) is superior to 2 damage to all attacks, particularly when you factor in that the AP would also increase my rupture damage slightly.  As such, it seems fairly clear to me, at least, that 2 weapon damage should be worth less than 14 AP - for a sword rogue, anyway.<br>
<br>
For a dagger rogue, with faster attacks, Striking is presumably worth somewhat more, but even then it would not be in the 50 AP range.</div>

	</tbody></table>
</div>It may be because of my low hit right now (234) and so it would decrease its value?  Not sure, but either way, I show it far less than 50 and about half of what you show.  <br>
<br>
That was my reasoning as well, the dmg is only as good as the attack speed.  Also, wouldnt it affect BS a little more because of the multiplier?  Just a thought, but even then, I dont think 150% x 11-12ap is still only 16-18ap.  WAY below the 50ap mark.  Hmm.  I'll ask these guys to give me math or hidden aspects of weapon damage that I dont know and possibly enlighten myself and even the spreadsheet in the end, but I'm guessing its some idiots attempt to justify his choice over another.  <br>
<br>
I spent &lt;1k gold to level LW and got 12-15dps increase from swiftstrike.  I will get around 10-12 from already having JC.  I'm not going to spend 3-5k gold to get enchanting for 11-12 ap.  LOL<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I'll find a place to host it and then load it up later tonite after my night class.  Not sure why it shows so low a value, but it just keeps me from wanting to level it even more. Also, even at 2k, that seems overly expensive for a profession that, on average, doesn't make much money in the end and only would offer these two ring enchants, nothing really substantial that is "BOP-profession holder only" type thing. Maybe once I'm complete in end-game gear and want to assert an extra 20-30 ap that I can't get any other way, I'll drop one of my two professions.  Until then, nah.<br>
<br>
<br>
I see what you did now, that makes sense.  So together, the ring enchants give around 30ap, generally.  That's not bad, but again, I don't see it being worth it until you're completely decked out in end-game gear/weps with no other avenue of dps increase...</div>

		<div id="post_message_494651">I would argue that the ring enchants are the "BoP-profession-holder-only" itemization for enchanters; you get 2 ring enchants that you can't get as a nonenchanter.  In fact, when you work out the numbers for a late BT rogues, Enchanting is one of the two most beneficial profession, by a significant margin.  Consider:<br>
<br>
Enchanting gives two ring enchants, totaling +8 str, agi, and sta, which works out to about 30 AP of offensive benefit.<br>
<br>
Jewelcrafting gives the ability to include BoP epic gems in your gear; however, only two of the JC gems (Delicate Fire Ruby and Rigid Bladestone) are actually upgrades over BT gems; hence you gain a grand total of 2 agi and 2 hit relative to socketing the same two slots with Glinting Pyrestones, for a net benefit of about 10 AP.<br>
<br>
Leatherworking gives you no long-term passive benefits, as Swiftstrike is not best-in-slot anywhere; however, the ability to make and use drums can be fairly beneficial; if used every time the cool is up, they provide about a 50 AP benefit in a sustained DPS scenario... to your entire group.  This does get expensive after a while, of course, so in practice they tend to be used more selectively; however, it's still a nontrivial bonus in the endgame.<br>
<br>
As such, in terms of a late BT rogue, there is a pretty compelling argument to be made for Leatherworking/Enchanting as the best two professions, with Enchanting/JC being the alternative.<br>
<br>
Now, in practice, most of us aren't to that level of progression, and while in SSC/TK/early BT/whatever, a number of other professions have merit (Engineering for Deathblow goggles; more of the JC gems are worth using, etc.).  But in the long run, I really do think Enchanting is where one optimally winds up.</div>

</div>I wasn't putting Enchanting as a "provides no BOP" aspect, I was trying to say that benefits gained right now are miniscule compared to JC/LW for myself.  <br>
<br>
True, you gain 2 hit and 2 agi but you also go another 4ap (Crimson Sun 24ap) over the 20ap BT gem.  Also, as far as I can tell the Rigid Bladestone (12hit) didnt make it into the patch, or is it off a vendor I didnt notice?  <br>
<br>
But for a pre Hyjal/BT rogue, as myself, with gems going to casters first, since we're a caster guild...ugh... I actually gain 8ap on the crimson sun, 6agi and 6hit over my current gems, making a benefit of almost 32ap, counting hit and agi as 2ap of course.  <br>
<br>
As for LW, I gain the swiftstrike set which, until BT/Late-Hyjal shoulders/wrists, are the best for a rogue, even post 2.2.  As we get into Hyjal and I get upgrades, I will certainly be looking at sacrificing LW for possibly Enchanting, but probably not until Inscription comes out in the XP to see if that is a viable melee dps profession (as of now, I dont think it will be, but we'll see).  <br>
<br>
All in all, I agree with you fully, end-game professions will probably be Enchanting/LW for most rogues pre-XP, but as of now, I'm not willing to lose the time/money invested in LW/JC until I've started to get my fill of BT gems.  By the way, how common are these gems/patterns?  I've heard anything from fairly common to horrible drop rates and wondering, if farming just first 2 bosses of Hyjal and first 3-4 bosses of BT in an effort to gain raid experience, could we be seeing a large amount of gems/patterns, or are we going to be bickering each night over a gem or two? lol</div>

</div>Yes, Eviscerate cycles are something that's on the list as something that might be nice to have someday.  However, they're so far down on the list I have no reasonable expectation of ever getting around to them.<br>
<br>
Also, while we're on the topic of Imp Evis, I would like to remind people that even if you *are* using Eviscerate as a finisher in PvE, this talent is usually not worth it.  The amount of dps you gain from it is point-for-point less than Vile Poisons; hence, it's only those mobs that are both bleed and poison immune where Improved Eviscerate is actually beneficial.  Now, there are certainly bosses that this is true of - Hydross, Void Reaver, and Doomwalker come to mind - but on the whole, trading a damage boost that works for 75% of boss fights for one that provides a smaller benefit on the remaining 25% just doesn't make much sense.  Therefore, I would attribute the presence of Imp Evis in Combat Swords builds to either a) a desire for increased PvP viability, or b) ignorance.  I suspect the 2nd is the more common cause.<br>

</div>Honestly, this trinket would be pretty far down on the list.  Even as a dagger rogue I don't see it scoring above 95 AP or so, which puts it behind everything on the sheet by 15 or more AP with the exception of Kiss of the Spider - which, honestly, given the haste nerf, I will probably be removing from the sheet as well.  It's not that it's a terrible trinket, per se, but the fact is that it isn't really in the same league as the trinkets already in the sheet - and there are plenty of trinkets in the list already that are accessible to Kara-level rogues.<br>
<br>
However, if people are of the opinion that more low-end gear is necessary as they're finding themselves in mid-Kara without some of the gear on this sheet, I can review the itemization selections again.<br>

</div>I was a bit surprised by this statement, so I went and did some math:<br>
<br>
Untalented, a 5 stack of deadly poison is 75 dps. Each point of vile poisons adds 75*0.04 = 3 dps. (Assuming you've got windfury over instant poison MH, of course) Assuming an average 5 point eviscerate is 1600, including crit, each point of improved eviscerate adds 80 damage to each evis. So for a point of vile poisons to add more dps than a point of improved eviscerate, you'd have to eviscerate less than once every (1600*0.05/x = 75*0.04) 26.6 seconds. This might be the case for daggers, but definitely not for swords.<br>
<br>
It's a bit of a moot point anyway, since I can't think of any bosses past Kara that are immune to rupture but not poisons, but I just thought that sounded off. Hopefully I did that math correctly.</div>

</div>So, admittedly, last time I did the calcs was, um, before anyone had killed Kael, so it was based more off T4/T5 type itemization, which lowers the value of Improved Eviscerate.  Hence, Imp Evis does fair better than I remembered.  However, there's a couple points I'd like to add:<br>
<br>
The thing to remember about Eviscerate cycles is that they take an extra 10 energy relative to Rupture cycles, meaning that it's hard for a sword rogue without 2/5 T4 to get a cycle shorter than 4s5r - which takes roughly 27 seconds to complete.  So, first off, we're totally in the right ballpark for them to be comparable, by your numbers.<br>
<br>
Second: I'm pretty sure Supremus is affected by poisons but not rupture.  I think there may be others as well, though I don't remember for certain.<br>
<br>
Third: the existance of bosses affected by poison but not rupture was only half of my point.  The other half is that, as the benefit gained by Vile Poison on bosses affected by poison is at least comparable to the benefit gained by Imp Evis on bosses immune to rupture, in order for the utility to be comparable, there'd need to be at least as many unrupturable bosses as there are poisonable bosses - which is not the case.  Hence my opinion that poisons are fairly clearly a superior choice.</div>

So my question is should I just simplify and switch to 5s/5r which shows minimal dps loss but would realistically probably be more dps because it negates human error...or should I switch to something like 3s/4r which isn't even suggested as a optimal rotation (probably for a good reason).

</div>Intuitively, such a cycle will be inferior to either 4s/5r or 3s/5r. You can see this by observing the following theorem:<br>
<br>
- For any Z &gt; X and any Y, and assuming swords are used, the cycle Zs/Yr has at least as high Slice and Dice uptime as Xs/Yr.<br>
<br>
This is pretty easily proven. At worst, to generate a single extra CP, you must spend 40 energy, which will take at most 4 seconds to generate. With 3/3 Imp SnD, each additional CP spent on Slice and Dice increases its duration by 4.35 seconds. Thus, increasing your SnD coefficient increases your Slice uptime by 0.35 seconds per additional CP spent. It is possible that the cycle Xs/Yr already has 100% Slice uptime. In that case, Zs/Yr would also have 100% Slice uptime.<br>
<br>
This proven, let's look at the two cycles 4s/5r and 3s/5r. There are two possible cases:<br>
<br>
- 3s/5r has 100% Slice uptime, and therefore so does 4s/5r. In this case, both cycles get identical damage contribution from Slice and Dice. However, 4s/5r takes longer to complete, and therefore has lower Rupture uptime and lower Rupture DPS. Thus, running 4s/5r/3s/5r would be strictly inferior to running 3s/5r.<br>
<br>
- 3s/5r does not have 100% Slice uptime, and 4s/5r has higher Slice uptime (possibly 100%, but it doesn't matter). In this case, you would lose significant DPS by running 3s/5r instead of 4s/5r. Therefore, running 4s/5r/3s/5r would be strictly inferior to running 4s/5r.<br>
<br>
There is almost no case where alternating cycles arbitrarily will achieve higher DPS. I did once model a type of cycle called a "Plus-cycle" where you would alter the coefficient of your finishers based on whether Ruthlessness or Netherblade 4-piece procced. Particularly, I was looking at a "+1s/5r" cycle, where you would always generate exactly 1 CP after Rupturing, and then Slice at either 1 CP or 2 CP (if Ruthlessness procced). However, my models almost always put this type of cycle behind the standard 2s/5r.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I just picked up blade of savagery and it puts my suggested rotation at 3.4s/5r.  Previously I've been doing 4s/5r because the suggested was at 3.5 beforehand so I just rounded up.  If I switch to 3s/5r now I'm not gonna have 100% snd uptime, which is clearly bad.  So my question is should I just simplify and switch to 5s/5r which shows minimal dps loss but would realistically probably be more dps because it negates human error...or should I switch to something like 3s/4r which isn't even suggested as a optimal rotation (probably for a good reason).  Also how does this affect my ashtongue trinket dps value?  (which btw I still think isn't valued as high as it should be right now)<br>
<br>
thanks for any help!</div>

</div>I would do either 4s5r or the weaving cycle that Koaschten mentions.  Although 5s5r doesn't cost you a whole lot of dps either, so if you're feeling particularly lazy it does fine as well.  I would not recommend 3s4r, though; the sub-5 rupture cycles don't tend to work very well as swords - they're more of a daggers thing.<br>
<br>
On the whole, switching to a shorter cycle doesn't change your Ashtongue uptime much; it means it lasts a larger proportion of the cycle when it does proc, but it doesn't proc all the time.  <br>
<br>
It should be noted that in the current release of the sheet, Ashtongue is being mis-scored slightly; for longer cycles (3s5r and above, basically) it's pretty close, but for the extremely compressed cycles (1s5r swords, 1s3r daggers, and the like) it's off by a fair amount.  This is being fixed in the next release.<br>

</div>Rupture scales better with AP, period.  Rupture gains .24 damage per AP; Evis gains a base of .15, as modified by crit chance at armor.  Assuming a raid buffed crit rate of 50% (which is not totally out of reach but defenitely high-end) and 2000 armor penetration above and beyond sunders from buffs and gear (likewise) on a lightly armored boss (4000 base armor), that only works out to .19 actual damage per AP for evis.  To put into perspective what you'd need to get to to have Evis scale better: even if your target had zero armor, your crit rate would need to be over 60% for Evis to scale better.  In practice, even with decent armor penetration, mobs still tend to have ~20% mitigation, meaning you'd need 100% crit rate for Evis to scale as well as Rupture.<br>
<br>
...and of course, that doesn't even count the fact that Evis costs more energy, such that even if the raw damage of Evis scaled as well as Rupture, the value of the 10 energy difference would scale as well which would *still* give Rupture the edge.<br>
<br>
Long story short: Rupture starts out better than Eviscerate, and scales faster.  Hence, you should only use Evis if you can't use rupture, regardless of your AP, talent, etc. situation.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Intuitively, such a cycle will be inferior to either 4s/5r or 3s/5r. You can see this by observing the following theorem:<br>
<br>
- For any Z &gt; X and any Y, and assuming swords are used, the cycle Zs/Yr has at least as high Slice and Dice uptime as Xs/Yr.<br>
<br>
This is pretty easily proven. At worst, to generate a single extra CP, you must spend 40 energy, which will take at most 4 seconds to generate. With 3/3 Imp SnD, each additional CP spent on Slice and Dice increases its duration by 4.35 seconds. Thus, increasing your SnD coefficient increases your Slice uptime by 0.35 seconds per additional CP spent. It is possible that the cycle Xs/Yr already has 100% Slice uptime. In that case, Zs/Yr would also have 100% Slice uptime.<br>
<br>
This proven, let's look at the two cycles 4s/5r and 3s/5r. There are two possible cases:<br>
<br>
- 3s/5r has 100% Slice uptime, and therefore so does 4s/5r. In this case, both cycles get identical damage contribution from Slice and Dice. However, 4s/5r takes longer to complete, and therefore has lower Rupture uptime and lower Rupture DPS. Thus, running 4s/5r/3s/5r would be strictly inferior to running 3s/5r.<br>
<br>
- 3s/5r does not have 100% Slice uptime, and 4s/5r has higher Slice uptime (possibly 100%, but it doesn't matter). In this case, you would lose significant DPS by running 3s/5r instead of 4s/5r. Therefore, running 4s/5r/3s/5r would be strictly inferior to running 4s/5r.<br>
<br>
There is almost no case where alternating cycles arbitrarily will achieve higher DPS. I did once model a type of cycle called a "Plus-cycle" where you would alter the coefficient of your finishers based on whether Ruthlessness or Netherblade 4-piece procced. Particularly, I was looking at a "+1s/5r" cycle, where you would always generate exactly 1 CP after Rupturing, and then Slice at either 1 CP or 2 CP (if Ruthlessness procced). However, my models almost always put this type of cycle behind the standard 2s/5r.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>I think you've missed the point of the 3s5r4s5r cycle.  The argument is as follows:<br>
<br>
3s5r cannot be supported with 100% SnD uptime; hence it is clearly inferior.<br>
4s5r gives 100% SnD uptime, but clips the ends of the SnD uptimes, which costs DPS.<br>
<br>
Hence, to realize full DPS, you perform a 4s5r and then get the 3 CPs for the next SnD ready; however, before using them, you let your energy regen a bit for the last few seconds of the existing SnD.  Thus, when you launch the 3s (right as the previous 4s is ticking off, ideally; sooner if your energy is about to cap out), you're not starting from 0 energy; you have 50 energy or whatever saved up. This extra energy gives you sufficient time to fire off the 5r and still get up to 4 CPs for the next SnD before the 3s ticks off.<br>
<br>
Basically: you use the fact that you can store up energy for a few seconds to weave in 3s5rs amongst your 4s5rs, hence maintaining 100% SnD uptime (which 3s5r cannot do) but with better rupture uptime than 4s5r.<br>
<br>
In practice, this is very very hard to do, since cycles are not ideal and you will find that, in practice, the burstiness of Combat Potency, Relentless Strikes, and Ruthlessness procs will leave you with SnD gaps if you try this.  If max energy was 200 allowing more room to bank energy, this would be more feasible; however, since max energy is only 100, there's not enough flexibility in this cycle to avoid SnD gaps.  Hence, I would recommend 4s5r on the whole, though feel free to try the woven cycle out if it sounds interesting to you.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Honestly, this trinket would be pretty far down on the list.  Even as a dagger rogue I don't see it scoring above 95 AP or so, which puts it behind everything on the sheet by 15 or more AP with the exception of Kiss of the Spider - which, honestly, given the haste nerf, I will probably be removing from the sheet as well.  It's not that it's a terrible trinket, per se, but the fact is that it isn't really in the same league as the trinkets already in the sheet - and there are plenty of trinkets in the list already that are accessible to Kara-level rogues.<br>
<br>
However, if people are of the opinion that more low-end gear is necessary as they're finding themselves in mid-Kara without some of the gear on this sheet, I can review the itemization selections again.</div>

</div>Well, according to the DPS Spreadsheet as a dagger rogue, the Crystalforged Trinket is only about 1.5 dps behind Hourglass and better than the other options available (given that I can't seem to get a DST or Poison Vial to drop), unless I'm missing something obvious.  I'm Exalted with all factions, have Abacus as my other Trinket.  Is there another accessible trinket I'm missing besides Hourglass?</div>

		<div id="post_message_495940">Well, lets see.  If I take my current gear and replace my weapons with the analagous daggers and my spec to the cookie-cutter 15/41/5, here's what I come up with:<br>
<br>
Striking to ring is worth 16.76 AP; hence +7 weapon damage from the trinket will be worth 3.5*16.76 = 58.7 AP.  The activated ability on Crystalforged is 216 AP with 16.7% uptime, and is thus worth 36 AP.  Hence, the total value of the trinket is 94.7<br>
<br>
Comparing this to other pre-Kara trinkets:<br>
<br>
Darkmoon Card - Crusade: 120<br>
Bloodlust Brooch: 116<br>
Abacus of Violent Odds: 114<br>
Icon of Unyielding Courage: 111<br>
Hourglass of the Unraveler: 110<br>
<br>
and, if you happen to have raided significantly pre-expansion:<br>
<br>
DFT: 106<br>
<br>
So, while it's true that Crystalforged isn't a *bad* trinket, given that it isn't even in the top 5 pre-raid trinkets, I don't feel the need to add it to the sheet.</div>

</div>The answer to this is "next patch... maybe".  To expand upon that a bit:<br>
<br>
The nerf to RED has been designated by Blizz as a bug, and it's slated to be fixed in a future patch.  Given that 2.2.2 came out today and I would expect 2.3 to be live in a month or two, i don't see any particularly urgent need to change it until they figure out what it's gonna do.  Particularly since it's not actually "a large downgrade".  Even in it's current, bugged, state, it still is competitive with TSD and better than SSD for the vast majority of people.  It's certainly not the best by as much as is indicated in the 0.7.7 sheet, but it's as good as anything right now and will soon be better; as such, there are far stupider things you could do than socket with RED right now; hence, this bug does not seem pressing enough for me to worry about excessively.</div>

</div>First thing - I did find that about 13 pages through the thread, so apologies.  Whoever is doing the UI for this spreadsheet could possibly change the column to "Use Socket Bonus" it would probably save posts :]<br>
<br>
Haste question - Im confused about the value assigned to the TSD as compared to the other spreadsheet (sorry, my only frame of reference) it seems to be worth significantly less than what the other sheet represents it as, of course I can only estimate that as change in overall dps, but what I see is that while the change in that is dramatic on your sheet you still value passive haste items higher than other items.<br>
<br>
One example of what I mean is that the other spreadsheet gives me only a very modest increase using swiftstrike shoulders over deathmantle, while yours is roughly double the dps increase (yes i mean change in rough dps not the numbers next to the item).  I guess my question is what differences are there between the passive haste calculations and the TSD, if any, or is it possibly just the proc rate is calculated significantly differently?  I understood it to be 1ppm per the other sheet.<br>
<br>
Almost forgot. Did you make changes to reduce ppm items/enchants etc as per last patch? I was curious to know what type of hit mongoose took from that lil nerf.</div>

4) No, the haste/PPM change is not in 0.7.7. It's one of the things I'm working on adding right now; it is also one of the largest changes that needs to be made, which is why it's taking some time.</div>

</div>1) Glad to help, it just seemed more intuitive.  Im sure there are probably better solutions as well.<br>
<br>
2) I had the toggle on the advanced settings page set to use PTR nerf, so I would assume that the answer for both is yes.  That is of course barring some wierd error in the other sheets calculations or item stats perhaps.<br>
<br>
3) That was just a shot in the dark really, in case you had run into it before.  The descrepancies bother me. Without a reason as to why it makes it difficult to explicitly trust either source.  <br>
<br>
4) I can see how that is going to be a complete nightmare.  Its quite unfortunate because I dont really anticipate it being a massive nerf, but its good to check.  <br>
<br>
5) Thanks for keeping me entertained at work its incredibly slow today.</div>

</div>I'd like to see the Assassination armor added.  I'm in an early SSC/TK guild and despite six months of running Kara, Nightbane has never dropped his chest for me.  (We took a long time to kill Mags because we've had a perpetual lack-of-tanks.)  I've been using the spreadsheet for several months with the Wastewalker Tunic instead, but it'd be nice to be able to model things exaclty.<br>
<br>
I know this isn't the first time someone's asked for the Assassination armor, but consider me another voice. <br>
<br>
Also: I'm currently using the WSC and Abacus for my trinkets, and according to the spreadsheet, Romulo's Poison Vial would be a small upgrade over the Abacus.  Is this really true if one already meets the hit cap?  The Vial would allow me to re-gem some of my gear away from +hit, adding 28 agility, but it's hard to believe that and the Vial's seemingly-weak proc are better than a static 64 AP and haste buff every two minutes.  I'm not sure how to work out the mathematics, unfortunately, but it might be worth double-checking in the sheet?</div>

		<div id="post_message_496824">I've considered the Assassination armor a couple of times, but what I arrive at every time I look at it is: there's just not much reason to wear most of the pieces.  There's generally at least 2 items in the sheet that are better and can be gotten with comparable effort.  This is not to say that there's not some unlucky people that are stuck using it, but I don't think it's worth including on the basis of the less-than-1% case of people who have failed to get all reasonable alternatives.<br>
<br>
Regarding RPV:  If you are actually going to benefit from the hit (either directly or via regemming), it tends to be worth using. It's true that the proc is not ridiculously powerful, but it's nonnegligble and, more to the point: it just has a lot of hit on it.  35 hit is already worth 90-100 AP, depending on your exact itemization, and when you factor in the proc as well, it tends to cruise past the pre-Kara trinkets with ease.<br>
<br>
It should be noted, however, than RPV will suffer a bit of a nerf from the revisions in the next version of the sheet, so it's probably not quite *as* strong as currently reported.  So if it's a question of "should I spend 300g regemming for a 30 AP benefit), I might wait until we see what the new numbers look like.</div>

</div>I point you to post #532 <a href="#undefined" target="_blank">here</a>.  Summary is that, yes that would be similar to a longer cycle, the less rupture dps is made up by higher rupture uptime.<br>
<br>
EDIT:  I also just realized that depending on the fight it might be much better, as it would perform much better in fights with many interuptions.</div>

		overflow: auto">This is pulled from the WoW forums when all the discussion came out.  We'll go with 2500 AP, 30% crit.  30 is right for me....AP is usually a bit higher when you average mongoose procs out.  Always assuming we have a battle shout bitch.

Evis
-----
AP Modifier = 2500 * 5 * .03 = 375
Eviscerate = 1045 + 375 = 1420 avg noncrit, no talents 
2 piece tier5 bonus: 1420+200 = 1620   (Hellfiller)
Improved Eviscerate + Aggression: 1620 * 1.15 * 1.06 = 1975 avg noncrit before armor mit
Crits: 1975 * (1 + 0.3 crit) = 2568 avg dmg again before armor mit

I had a 2973 on Leo tonight with 5 sunders up.  With the AP I had it tells me he has &lt; 20% mit.  That puts avg evis dmg for him at 2054 or better.


Rupture
-----------
AP Modifier = 2500 * 0.24 = 600
Rupture = 1000 + 600 = 1600 dmg
w/ Mangle = 2080 dmg  -  rarely ever in our raids


2054 &gt; 1600.  Barely different if you have Mangle.  Obviously none of us have Serrated Blades.  If Squeep does then yes he should be using Rupture.</pre>
</div><br>
He's using 2500 ap as his base, with 30% crit (which is about average for us).  We don't have a feral druids mangle on the boss as of late.  Also, dont take into account any passive armor penetration.   If possible, could someone show me the post with the me math or do the math using those stats for a general boss?  "Tidewalker or FLK would be fine"</div>

		<!-- message -->
		<div id="post_message_497988">So, a couple of key mistakes in that math:<br>
<br>
1) 20% mitigation from armor is only feasible assuming a) a low-armor boss initially, b) Faerie Fire and Curse of Recklessness are both up.  Which, admittedly, is true some of the time.  However, it is not true all of the time, and in all other circumstances, Eviscerate should be more heavily mitigated.<br>
<br>
2) 2500 AP strikes me as awfully low for raid-buffed SSC rogues, and a higher AP will favor rupture.<br>
<br>
3) And most importantly, the fact that Eviscerate costs 10 extra energy is totally neglected, and it is this, more than anything, that gives rise to the superiority of Rupture.  Yes, a single Evis can do more damage than a single rupture; however, the rupture saves 10 energy that can be used to some other end, such as an additional Sinister Strike every 4 ruptures.  Assuming, say, Talon as your MH, a SS with 2500 AP 30% crit a SS does about 1275 unmitigated, or, at 20% mitigation as cited, our 1/4 of a SS adds 255 damage (and 1/4 of a combo point, which further increases the size of the *next* finisher...), which closes the stated gap considerably.<br>
<br>
If you'd like to see an alternative analysis of the situation, I would refer you to post 645 where, conveniently, I have already done these calculations.</div>

<br>
I know the hitcap is at 308 with Weapon Expertise but what is the hitcap without Weapon Expertise? and what is the hitcap with Weapon Expertise and human racial?<br>
<br>
So from what I've read after the first 5 points of weapon skill it drops in value, does the spreadsheet take this into consideration? And if not, is Belt of One-Hundred Death really worth it compared to Belt of Deep Shadow for a human rogue?<br>

Have looked around for an answear and it's probably around somewhere but I've missed it, so I would be grateful if I got some helps.<br>

I am now using my BoI instead of ToA that I have been using since the patch to get my hit closer to the cap. I also have a Blood Lust that I'm not using.<br>
I am also considering changing my meta from TSD to RED but I would like to know more about the haste nerf on TSD and the DPS difference before I change it.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Okay, i know there was some belt discussion, but it was Alejandro's vs Hundred Deaths. I'd like to ask,  Deep Shadow and Hundred Deaths, which one is better? I'm Currently using <a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=29247" target="_blank">Girdle of the Deathdealer</a>, which i think, is better than Gronn stitched and treachery. We're now close to getting Vashj down, but at the same time our rogue team is anxiously waiting for deep shadow pattern to drop for the guild. Would be nice if someone laid down some facts bout deep shadow and hundred deaths, thank you in advance.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">First I want to thank you for creating this spread sheet and the the Oo version for those of us without Axcel.<br>
<br>
This might sound like a dumb question but I am wondering what my exact rotation should be. <br>
I'm not a numbers cruncher and just got the Oo spread sheet the other night and noticed some minor things I needed to adjust with what equipment I have.<br>
<br>
I am now using my BoI instead of ToA that I have been using since the patch to get my hit closer to the cap. I also have a Blood Lust that I'm not using.<br>
I am also considering changing my meta from TSD to RED but I would like to know more about the haste nerf on TSD and the DPS difference before I change it.<br>
<br>
My approximate cycle says 2.8s5r and I wanted to know what you suggest my exact or close to exact cycle should be to maxamize my DPS.<br>
<br>
I have my 4/5 T5 and since getting it I have not been sure of what it should be and getting your Oo version last night I can see it is different from what I have been doing.</div>

Looked at that just a moment ago, and that doesnt show the 30% mitigation on a boss that aldriana posted in post 645.  You posted 30%, which on most bosses that are not high-armor, you're looking at around 25% with 5sa (which ever raid will have just about). I also noticed, on the numbers based were not the avg Eviscerate base dmg, but the low end.<br>
<br>
I'm going to copy and paste Aldriana's previous information:<br>
<br>
A 5 point eviscerate does <b>1045</b> + .15*AP raw damage; with the aforementioned 3k AP, this works out to <b>1495</b> damage. 2/5 will raise this to <b>1695</b>. With 3/3 Imp Eviscerate and 3/3 Aggression (which is sort of a rare talent spec, but we'll go with it), this is increased by a further 21% to <b>2051</b>  damage. Based on the crit rate in the sheet, for me, 32.6% of those eviscerates will crit; hence, total damage from the eviscerate is <b>2720</b> damage. This is, however, mitigated by armor, <b>WAIT</b>.  Most of the armor bosses we face have around 6200 armor (37% mitigation), but if you include 5SA, as the poster does, that lowers the armor to 3600 or 25.5% mitigation, not nearly the 30.5% you posted previously.  That would bring the avg dmg up to <b>2039</b><br>
<br>
**Bold items were "fixed" by me to include the avg. evisc base dmg, instead of only the low-end as well as the proper armor mitigation 6200 (37%) - 2600 for 5SA which almost all raids have which comes to 3600 armor for most bosses (25.5%, not 30%).<br>
<br>
<br>
True, you would have to add the 271dmg of the avg SS's back in (See post #645 if anyone doesnt follow), but even then, rupture, on avg of an unmangled target, would only do, including the SS dmg, 1720 + 271 = 1991 (which would possibly be higher since less armor for the SS to be mitigated by).  <br>
<br>
I do this not to prove anyone wrong, rather to show how close evisc CAN BE, and if stacked with enough armor pen, raids buffs (CoR and imp FF), I think it comes out to more dmg tbh.  Looking at it now, the difference is 48 Dmg on avg in favor of Eviscerate.  The problem is, you are losing vile poisons to gain the imp eviscerate dmg and calculating in 2/5 T5 to help this dmg out.  So the 10 more energy you have to spend for 48dmg is amazingly un-worth it, not to mention the difference in your poisons.<br>
<br>
Also, if anyone sees fallacies or incorrect math, please tell me, I freaking hate when I mess stuff like that up.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">So from what I've read after the first 5 points of weapon skill it drops in value, does the spreadsheet take this into consideration? And if not, is Belt of One-Hundred Death really worth it compared to Belt of Deep Shadow for a human rogue?</div>

</div>The first 5 points of Weapon Skill are indeed more valuable than the later ones; this subtlety is not included in the sheet (and intentionally so).  For purposes of this sheet, weapon skill is modeled according to our best guess on how it works for weapon skill 355 and higher.  Hence, while the numbers in the sheet for weapon skill items might be incorrect if you don't have any +weapon skill from racials, gear, and talents, it is correct in most other cases.  In particular, Belt of One Hundred deaths is correctly modeled for a human rogue so, according to the best information we have available at this time, One-Hundred Deaths is slightly better than Deep Shadow. It's not a huge difference, but it is better.<br>

</div>1) I'm pretty sure I worked it out and Eviscerate's average damage is, in fact, 985.  I'll doublecheck it when I get home tonight.<br>
<br>
2) The only place where "most" bosses have 6200 armor is Hyjal, and, admittedly, for these low-armor bosses it might indeed make sense to use Eviscerate... if you happen to be specced for it, *and* have 2/5 T5, *and* have no feral druid in your raid.  However, the majority of bosses in SSC/TK/BT have 7700 armor, which, post-sunders and faerie fire, is 4600 armor, which works out to 30.3% mitigation.  Even with CoR (which is not always available) these bosses only make it down to 26.5%<br>
<br>
3) As a ballpark estimate on the poison issue: <br>
<br>
Since we're assuming 2/5 T5, I'm going to say it's more likely than not that the 2/5 T4 will not be present as well.  There will certainly be some people with both, but most likely more that do not.  Hence, the optimal eviscerate cycle is something on the order of 4s5e, which takes roughly 26 seconds to complete.  In this 26 seconds, the 3 points in vile poisons that a rupturing rogue will have in place if ImpEvis will contribute 9 dps, or a total of 234 additional poison damage, which blows away whatever benefit Eviscerate might have possessed.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">1) I'm pretty sure I worked it out and Eviscerate's average damage is, in fact, 985.  I'll doublecheck it when I get home tonight.<br>
<br>
2) The only place where "most" bosses have 6200 armor is Hyjal, and, admittedly, for these low-armor bosses it might indeed make sense to use Eviscerate... if you happen to be specced for it, *and* have 2/5 T5, *and* have no feral druid in your raid.  However, the majority of bosses in SSC/TK/BT have 7700 armor, which, post-sunders and faerie fire, is 4600 armor, which works out to 30.3% mitigation.  Even with CoR (which is not always available) these bosses only make it down to 26.5%<br>
<br>
3) As a ballpark estimate on the poison issue: <br>
<br>
Since we're assuming 2/5 T5, I'm going to say it's more likely than not that the 2/5 T4 will not be present as well.  There will certainly be some people with both, but most likely more that do not.  Hence, the optimal eviscerate cycle is something on the order of 4s5e, which takes roughly 26 seconds to complete.  In this 26 seconds, the 3 points in vile poisons that a rupturing rogue will have in place if ImpEvis will contribute 9 dps, or a total of 234 additional poison damage, which blows away whatever benefit Eviscerate might have possessed.</div>

1) I looked at wowhead, it showed 985-1105 as the range, it may be wrong, or I might have misread it.  <br>
<br>
2) I just noticed that was the case, thinking I saw more 6200 than 7700 mobs.  Good to know, that just helps my case, as I'm pro vile poisons/rupture.  Also, I completely agree that having imp evis, agression, 2/5 t4 AND 2/5 T5 seems most illogical to gain, at most 48dmg per finisher on avg.  Thats why I'm trying to get my math right, I want to be able to show these idiots what they are doing is wrong, on the most basic mathematical level.<br>

</div>Wouldn't that be the same as 6x the +2 damage ring?  The cheap way to calculate it would be to put your equipment in the spreadsheet; take 6x the ring enchant and add 1.22 the value of one point in Malice.

What you actually mean is that for the stone to do more, you need to be doing 2500 damage (from all sources) per offhand hit. Now, with a 1.4 speed offhand, S'n'D, plus other haste buffs, yoru offhand will hit something like once per second, which makes the maths convenient.<br>

</div>I was hoping no one would notice that, because I was trying to finesse past that point.  Yes, it's true, a single damage stone affects crit on both hands.  However, it's also true that a single crit stone only gives .61% crit, not 1.22%; that calculation was based on having crit stones on both weapons and then looking at the damage from both, which is, of course, somewhat of a bogus way of doing it due to the fact that the stone is more valuable OH than it is MH.  However, in terms of approximating the value, it seemed to me to be in the right ballpark.<br>
<br>
If you're going to do the approximation that you're working off of, you need to work off .61% crit instead, which doubles the DPS requirement to 5k.  Not that I think that's a particularly accurate way of measuring it either.<br>
<br>
In terms of a better approximation, a little spreadsheet hacking reveals a gear/buff combination that results in 2230 buffed DPS (or so), yet MH Weapon Stone only adds 27 DPS, and OH 21.  Compare to, for instance, OH Deadly Poison that does 84 DPS.  Or MH WF which does, um, a lot.<br>
<br>
Point being: I don't see stones being useful in the forseeable future.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I'm testing for about 60 minutes with no passive haste (except for mongoose speed increase when it procs) and no dragonspine trophy, just autoattack with no DPS cycle. If you want me to take another log with my usual 3s/5r cycle, I can. Just let me know what you need.<br>

</div>Yes, I also have a stack of sharpening stones on me for whenever I bump into immune bosses aka hydross, VR. Not that we need it, but I just want highest dps available.<br>
<br>
I'd be happy to see them added if you ever reconsider. But as a stone user, I agree they aren't of any use except for these bosses.<br>
<br>
Oh, and I do not always have WF available. So I am very confused. How do the 2 stones stack MH/OH?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Hi Ald. I'm currently in the process of beating the crap out of a servant in the Blasted Lands to test the proc rate of the Twin Blades of Azzinoth. I'll upload my combat log when I'm done for you and edit this post with a link. One thing I can tell you right off the bat is that there is <b>no internal cooldown</b> on the haste proc.<br>
<br>
I'm testing for about 60 minutes with no passive haste (except for mongoose speed increase when it procs) and no dragonspine trophy, just autoattack with no DPS cycle. If you want me to take another log with my usual 3s/5r cycle, I can. Just let me know what you need.<br>

</div>So, first off: grats on the warglaives.  I think I speak for most of us when I say: /jealous<br>
<br>
Second: Thanks for taking the time to take some data.<br>
<br>
In terms of actual analysis: I show 94 periods of Warglaive uptime in that combatlog, and 5265 total hits.  Grinding through the data, we find that of those 94 periods of uptime, there are 19 at least 11 seconds in length, including 5 at least 21 seconds in length, and 1 that is more than 31 seconds in length.  Hence, there were, at minimum 122 distinct haste procs in the data set.  In reality, there may have been a few more, but lets go with the 122 number for the moment.<br>
<br>
122 procs in 5265 total hits works out to a proc rate of roughly 2.32% on the test, with a standard deviation of .21%; hence, if it's a fixed percent proc, the true value lies between 1.91% and 2.72%.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, it might be a PPM effect; were it 1 PPM, one would expect to see 156 procs in that data set; since only 122 were observed, I think it somewhat unlikely that it's 1 PPM; it would need to be .8 PPM or so instead.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, due to the nature of the set, it's going to be hard to isolate the hands and figure out which hand procced what; hence figuring out the exact proc mechanics is going to be challenging.  I can think of two pieces of data that might be helpful in determining it for certain:<br>
<br>
1) If one stands sidewise to a mob, it is possible to find a position wherein you can still land specials on the mob, but not autoattack it.  A data set of this sort, where there are no autoattacks present but only SS (or Shiv, your choice) spam, should be able to isolate one hand from the other.<br>
<br>
2) Attacking the mob normally, but with using SS and SnD instead of straight autoattack.  If it's a PPM effect, SnD will reduce the proc rate; if it's a fixed percent, it will not.  This would provide some insight as to what sort of proc we're dealing with.<br>
<br>
What we *can* say from this is that the set bonus is still sickeningly powerful, even with the haste nerf.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
I am surprised by the massive dmg boost with this trinket over my romulo's vial.<br>
According to your spreadsheet, upgrading that trinket would grant me way more dps than the upgrade <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28729" target="_blank">[Spiteblade]</a>&gt;&gt;<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30082" target="_blank">[Talon of Azshara]</a>.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, when i compare the result with the other DPS spreadsheet, the results are pretty different, the boost is then higher for the sword upgrade.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_500567"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->This sheet has not yet been updated for the Dragonspine nerf in the last patch.  Prior to 2.2, Dragonspine was indeed a larger upgrade than Talon; in fact, Dragonspine by itself provided an upgrade rivaling all SSC + TK loot put together (relative to their T4/Karazhan/Heroic counterparts).<br>
<br>
With the nerf to Dragonspine (which will be reflected in 0.8, whenever I get around to finishing it), it will still be quite a significant upgrade over Romulo's, and, hence, among the more important upgrades for a rogue to get; however, it will no longer be far and away the largest upgrade, and it will, for instance, be a smaller upgrade than Talon.<br>
<br>
As for why the other sheet differs: I don't know if they have implemented the Dragonspine nerf yet; if they had, that is probably at least part of the difference.  Beyond that, I would refer you the Frequently Asked Questions section of the first post in this thread.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>As Vulajin mentions, haste nerf is in; the Dragonspine Trophy nerf is not.<br>
<br>
As for when the next version is ready: hard to say.  I was hoping to have it out by now, but I got rather busy with work and various other commitments.  Looking down my to-do list of changes, there's still several hours of work that needs to be done - it's simply a matter of when I can find time to bang through this list.  Sometime early next week is possible; failing that, hopefully next weekend.  But, as always: no promises.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Is anyone currently trying out either the Fist/Sword spec (18/43) with Talon of Phoenix OR the maces spec with Rod of Sun King and Swiftsteel Bludgeon?  I was wondering, if about equally geared, how you do in actual raiding environments against sword rogues with ToA/Merc.

After 2.2, has the value of the Abacus dropped below that of the Card? Shadowpanther lists both Abacus and Hourglass a bit higher than the card, so if I can just get those and actually be better off, then I wont bother using the Deck and just sell it.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<!-- message -->
		<div id="post_message_501270"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->For purely sustained fights, Crusade beats Abacus by about 10 AP.  However, Crusade takes about 10 seconds to stack up, meaning that for fights that are less than a minute in length - or fights where you suffer interruptions 10 seconds in length at least once a minute, on average - Abacus wins, even neglecting the fact that Abacus is improved by interrupted fights.  So if you're doing 25-man raid bosses that are frequently this length or longer, Crusade is probably better than Abacus.  Of course, if you're doing 25 man raid bosses, you should have access to trinkets that are a fair amount better than either.  But if you're just doing 5-mans or Karazhan, Crusade is probably less worthwhile.<br>
<br>
So, all in all: if you have the money to spend, there's certainly a place for it.  But it's not a huge upgrade, and, depending on what you're doing, it may not be an upgrade at all.<br>
<br>
P.S. You probably want to fill out your WoW Profile at some point, as it makes it easier to assess what your other options might be.  Also, the powers that be get grumpy if you don't.  Just a friendly tip .<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_501740"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->When it was first announced I ran some numbers on it and concluded that it was probably going to be slightly inferior to mongoose for rogues (making in vastly superior for dps warriors and shaman, one would think).  However, the newest revision of the sheet is going to change some things that will affect their relative values, which may close the gap somewhat; when I finish 0.8, I'll revisit this question.<br>

Also, I have another mechanics question for you fine people: does anyone know how Improved Hunter's Mark works?  The spell description on thottbot reads:<br>
<br>
"Places the Hunter's Mark on the target, increasing the ranged attack power of all attackers against that target by 110 and by an additional 11 each time they are struck by a ranged attack, up to a maximum of 440."<br>
<br>
The talent reads:<br>
<br>
"Causes 100% of your Hunter's Mark ability's base attack power to apply to melee attack power as well"<br>
<br>
So my question is: is "base attack power" just the 110?  Or do we get the benefit up to 440?  And in the latter case, how long does it take to stack up (aka, how frequently do hunters land ranged attacks?   1/second?  More than that?)<br>
<br>
Finally a question for uhohzombies:  I could figure it out myself, but in the interest of saving time: were you wearing 2/5 T6 for that test? i.e., is that 30% SnD, or 35% SnD?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_501954"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I haven't done much analysis on this myself, but the other spreadsheet thread has some discussion of the topic; the salient points of which are: Shiv has significantly lower damage per energy efficiency than Sinister Strike, and the increased rate of finishers is not generally sufficient to overcome this.  At low itemization levels (like, preKara) shiv/envenom does okay, but it scales very poorly such that by the time you're talking late T5 and beyond, it's obviously inferior.<br>
<br>
Hence, until someone demonstrates theorycraft that says otherwise, I'm not inclined to spend to much time worrying about it.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_501984"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Actually I think it's the opposite.  If we look at the WWS data for the Anetheron kill.<br>
White damage was constant in both, 64% of overall damage.<br>
Shiv did 18% (96,000).<br>
Sinister strike did 25% (115,000).<br>
Envenom did 10% and 52,500 damage during the fight.<br>
Rupture did 5% and 24,700 damage during the fight.<br>
<br>
Now as you can see, Shiv only did 20,000 less than Sinister Strike.  But Envenom did 28k more damage than Rupture.<br>
<br>
Looking at the individual damage of Envenom and Rupture.  Rupture average ticks for 280, which means on average a full duration Rupture was doing 2240 damage.  Envenom non-crits average 2178 and crits average 4386.<br>
<br>

		<div id="post_message_501998"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Sure, in raw numbers.  But lets look at percentages, which are more illustrative:<br>
<br>
Shive + Evenom did 28%.<br>
Rupture + SS did 30%<br>
<br>
So, while the raw amount of damage might be higher for Shiv/Envenom, the total amount of damage done was higher as well; hence, assuming white damage is relatively constant between the two builds (which should be a safe assumption), the dps contribution of CPGs and finishers is lower with the shiv/envenom build, meaning it's overall dps contribution is lower, hence the overall DPS is lower.<br>
<br>
I'd also like to note that I don't consider WWS of fights shorter than half an hour as indicative of anything; there's just to much variation, particularly in a 5 min fight like Anetheron.  Samples need to be large enough so as to be statistically significant, or supported by theory, before they're particularly interesting.<br>
<br>
Regardless, it's not really germane to this discussion anyway, since this sheet could not easily be adapted to do shiv cycles, so even if I did think it was a competitive cycle (and I don't) I'd make a separate shiv sheet rather than modifying this one.<br>
<br>
Edit: as an example of what I mean by variance, it should be noted that, for instance, the SS trial only had a 25% crit rate on SS (versus ~35% crit for autoattacks in both trials), and Envenom had a 50% crit rate in that test.  The fact that rupture was ticking for 10% more damage in the Shiv/Evis test makes suspect unequal buffs (or unequal proc uptime) as well.  Any results that might be gleaned from this are thus buried in the statistical noise.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_502617"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->As a sword rogue, 2/5 T4 doesn't actually do a whole lot.  A lot of people like it because it makes life easier, but in terms of actual damage output it just doesn't do much.  Hence, while 4/5 T5 is somewhat overvalued in the current version, I'd be willing to bet a fair amount of money that you'll see a damage increase by going to 4/5 T5.<br>
<br>
In other news:<br>
<br>
I ground the Warglaive data this morning, and man, this is a tough cookie to crack.<br>
<br>
In the initial data set, there were 5265 attacks, and 119 procs (there was a bug in my program which generated the above numbers; hence the 119 number is correct).  This means that, if it's a fixed-percent proc, we can say with 95% confidence that the true proc rate is between 1.86% and 2.66%.  Grinding through all the haste effects, we find that there would be an expected 156 procs of a 1 PPM effect in a data set this size; Hence, if it's a PPM, it's somewhere around .75 PPM<br>
<br>
In the SnD/Rupture data, there are 3393 attacks and 71 procs.  This means that, if it's a fixed-percent proc, we can say with 95% confidence that the true proc rate is between 1.61% and 2.57%.  Grinding through the haste effects + SnD, we find that a 1 PPM effect would expect to go off about 106 times in a data set this size; hence, if it's a PPM, it's somewhere around .67 PPM<br>
<br>
So, from this data, we can say: the proc rate is somewhere in the 1.8%-2.6% range, or it's a PPM effect around .67-.75 PPM.<br>
<br>
In the SS-only data, there were 9 procs in 298 swings; hence, the proc rate is somewhere between 1.08% and 4.96% with 95% confidence.   This includes both the fixed-% range (1.8-2.6), and the PPM range (3.1-3.5) - so we can't really say much.<br>
<br>
Long story short: need more data.  I suspect the SS-Only testing is gonna be the best way to pin this down, but it's gonna take a really big (like, several hours) data set to tell the difference, I'm afraid.  Unless people are feeling really ambitious with the testing, we may have to just punt on it and take our best guess.... if they're this hard to tell apart, it probably won't be *too* inaccurate to just pick one and go with it.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_502775"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Forgive me if this has been posted before.  I've read several pages of this thread, and haven't seen anything similar.  I downloaded version 0.7.7 of the Gear spreadsheet today, and I found some odd behavior when selecting talents.<br>
<br>
I've used the Rogue DPS Spreadsheet quite extensively to fine-tune my gear and build, and was a little surprised to find that as 19/42/0 combat swords rogue, I would get more DPS out of 1/5 Lethality and 4/5 Imp Poisons rather than a full 5/5 Lethality.  I like the Imp Poisons talent for PvP and Arenas, and the fact that it would also increase my sustained DPS was great.  However, selecting this combination of talents on the Rogue Gear Spreadsheet caused my optimal hit rating to skyrocket from 261 to 337.  <br>
<br>
Am I doing something wrong, or is this talent being incorrectly used in the spreadsheet?  I fail to see how less critical strike damage bonus would affect optimal hit in such a drastic manner.<br>
<br>
Thanks in advance,<br>

		<div id="post_message_502794"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->From the FAQ in the first post of this thread:<br>
<br>
"Q: What does "Optimal Hit" mean?<br>
A: Optimal Hit reflects the amount of hit rating if you socketed and enchanted your current gear optimally. For exactly what is considered to be optimal for you, consult the middle gear column. Optimal Hit *doesn't* have anything to do with the hit cap - is just an indication of how much hit you'd have if you socketed according to the recommendations in the middle column. This is primarily intended as a warning mechanism, as, in general, "optimal" involves socketing stuff with a whole lot of +8 hit gems, which will frequently put you over the hit cap - the Optimal Hit number is designed to warn you about this so you know not to socket so overwhelmingly with hit."<br>
<br>
So, what's happening is: with lethality, agi is better than hit for you, so it's recommending socketing most things with +agi; as such, the total hit in the optimal socketing of your gear is 261.  If you remove a point from Lethality and put it in Improved Poisons, this lowers the value of the crit you get from agility, such that hit becomes a better stat and it becomes better to socket all your gear with +hit, causing the total hit on the optimal socketing of your gear to skyrocket.<br>
<br>
I would be a little cautious about taking Imp Poisons over Lethality, since a) not all mobs are poisonable, but Lethality works on everything, and b) if you have access to Windfury on a somewhat regular basis, Imp Poisons contributes (effectively) no DPS at all (although Vile Poisons still gives a modest increase).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_502825"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Thanks very much for the clarification.  I read the initial post with the FAQ, but didn't realize that the 4 points in Lethality changed the optimal socketing so significantly.<br>
<br>
I understand that from a pure PvE standpoint, Lethality will win out when I'm fully raid buffed.  However, since I'm in a small guild, I'm not likely to do much outside of 10 man raiding.  I chose Imp Poisons primarily for Arenas to stack Wound Poison faster, and Lethality has lost some of its effectiveness to resilience.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">As a sword rogue, 2/5 T4 doesn't actually do a whole lot.  A lot of people like it because it makes life easier, but in terms of actual damage output it just doesn't do much.  Hence, while 4/5 T5 is somewhat overvalued in the current version, I'd be willing to bet a fair amount of money that you'll see a damage increase by going to 4/5 T5.<br>
<br>
In other news:<br>
<br>
I ground the Warglaive data this morning, and man, this is a tough cookie to crack.<br>
<br>
In the initial data set, there were 5265 attacks, and 119 procs (there was a bug in my program which generated the above numbers; hence the 119 number is correct).  This means that, if it's a fixed-percent proc, we can say with 95% confidence that the true proc rate is between 1.86% and 2.66%.  Grinding through all the haste effects, we find that there would be an expected 156 procs of a 1 PPM effect in a data set this size; Hence, if it's a PPM, it's somewhere around .75 PPM<br>
<br>
In the SnD/Rupture data, there are 3393 attacks and 71 procs.  This means that, if it's a fixed-percent proc, we can say with 95% confidence that the true proc rate is between 1.61% and 2.57%.  Grinding through the haste effects + SnD, we find that a 1 PPM effect would expect to go off about 106 times in a data set this size; hence, if it's a PPM, it's somewhere around .67 PPM<br>
<br>
So, from this data, we can say: the proc rate is somewhere in the 1.8%-2.6% range, or it's a PPM effect around .67-.75 PPM.<br>
<br>
In the SS-only data, there were 9 procs in 298 swings; hence, the proc rate is somewhere between 1.08% and 4.96% with 95% confidence.   This includes both the fixed-% range (1.8-2.6), and the PPM range (3.1-3.5) - so we can't really say much.<br>
<br>
Long story short: need more data.  I suspect the SS-Only testing is gonna be the best way to pin this down, but it's gonna take a really big (like, several hours) data set to tell the difference, I'm afraid.  Unless people are feeling really ambitious with the testing, we may have to just punt on it and take our best guess.... if they're this hard to tell apart, it probably won't be *too* inaccurate to just pick one and go with it.</div>

	</tbody></table>
</div>I have to admit, the thought of sitting in my chair for several hours hitting sinister strike in the Blasted Lands isn't too appealing. One thing I can attest to is the proc rate is obscene. The proc rate "feels"(non-scientific hehe) to be on par with the DST pre-nerf and given that it gives 450 haste rating as opposed to 325 and has no internal cooldown, it would be safe to say that it is as powerful, if not more so, as a pre-nerf DST.<br>
<br>
By the way, I forgot to mention that I accidentally left the DST in for the SnD testing. Could that have tainted the data in any way? If so, I can redo that test without any other haste coming into play.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_503012"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Most rogues tend to agree that Ruthlessness is better purely because Murder doesn't apply to all enemies.  I don't think anyone really questions the fact that Murder is superior to Ruthlessness on those mobs that are affected by it; however, since not all mobs are, people tend to prefer the less powerful but always applicable Ruthlessness.  In SSC/TK, for instance, while many of the bosses are affected by Murder, there are any number of important adversaries that are not (Hydross, Void Reaver, Al'ar, Vashj's elementals, Kael's weapons, possibly Leotheras in demon form (although I'd have to check that), and so on.<br>
<br>
On the whole, though, I agree that in SSC/TK, Murder is likely more worthwhile.  However, as one moves into the T6 instances, the points in Ruthlessness will become superior.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

However it does take a fair amount of concentration to use optimally. You have to be careful to avoid energy overflow, especially with lag. If you are comfortable mixing and matching cycles on the fly, I recommend it.

		<div id="post_message_503869"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I'm wondering for the Kael fight..<br>
We rogues can get 2 weapons, the sword and the dagger. What would be the best weaponchoice for us there? Normaly I wield Merciless Gladiator's Slicer (MH) + Merciless Gladiator's Quickblade (OH). <br>
Wielding 2 legendaries with 122 dps looks great at first sight but being swordspec I fear I would be best off with the Warp Slicer (MH) and my normal arena S2 offhand.  <br>
<br>
So what would be best? I tried inputting the legendaries into the spreadsheet but when adding the weaps it seems to work but when I change it's name I get a divide by 0 error so I'm guessing I'm screwing it up somewhere. <br>
<br>
So my question.. what would be best?<br>
1) Warp Slicer (MH) + Infinity Blade (OH)<br>
2) Warp Slicer (MH) + Merciless Gladiator's Quickblade (OH)<br>
3) some other combo<br>
<br>
My thoughts: <br>
1) 2 legendaries can't be bad right? No OH swordprocs though<br>
2) Legendary sword with best swordspec procs due to fast OH<br>
3) seriously doubt any other combo can be better<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_504014"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I admit that I haven't done any in-depth analysis on this, but my off-the-cuff estimate is as follows:<br>
<br>
Infinity Blade is a 122 DPS, 2.0 speed weapon.<br>
Quickblade is a 97 DPS, 1.5 speed weapon.<br>
<br>
As a rule of thumb, each .1 OH speed is worth about 10 DPS.  Hence, Infinity Blade is as good as a 72 dps 1.5 speed weapon.  Infinity Blade is also not a sword, and while it's stat mods are somewhat superior, it's not nearly enough to make up the difference.  Hence, the only reason to use Infinity Blade would be for the proc.<br>
<br>
However, 1 person can keep the debuff up on the boss with east, so if, for instance, the MT is tanking with Infinity Blade, the proc does nothing.<br>
<br>
Hence, what I usually do is run Infinity Blade MH, Quickblade OH, and do most of the fight like that.  However, I make a point to pick up an Infinity Blade as well, and I have a macro to de-equip my main hand and equip Infinity Blade in OH so I can go Shiv people should the tanks need help with that.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>It would be a bit foolosh to ruin your dps for a few stabs to de-MC someone. <br>
Anyway, I guess you all agree with my feeling that a fast OH sword is better then a slow legendary dagger with ~20% more dps.  Guess that will be what I'll be nuking with from now on.<br>
<br>
And yes the dagger is needed for de-MC'ing.. but you want to do that with ONLY the dagger anyway so you'll need to macro it anyway. Just using dagger OH or MH with another legendary is way to risky if they get unlucky and resets a few stabs <!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">From the FAQ in the first post of this thread:<br>
<br>
"Q: What does "Optimal Hit" mean?<br>
A: Optimal Hit reflects the amount of hit rating if you socketed and enchanted your current gear optimally. For exactly what is considered to be optimal for you, consult the middle gear column. Optimal Hit *doesn't* have anything to do with the hit cap - is just an indication of how much hit you'd have if you socketed according to the recommendations in the middle column. This is primarily intended as a warning mechanism, as, in general, "optimal" involves socketing stuff with a whole lot of +8 hit gems, which will frequently put you over the hit cap - the Optimal Hit number is designed to warn you about this so you know not to socket so overwhelmingly with hit."</div>

</div>Aye.  Is there any prospect of changing your calculations of gemming to make them worth something?  When I'm trying to decide between rigid dawnstones and glinting topaz in my yellow sockets, it is no use whatsoever to tell me that rigid dawnstone is better if you ignore the fact that hit is capped.  Heck, it will even tell me to socket more rigid dawnstones <i>when I'm already over the hit cap</i>.  Right now I'm sitting at 307 hit rating, and it's telling me to rip out my +12 crit stone and put in a +8 hit stone. <br>
<br>
It's simply not fit for purpose with regard to gemming - you might as well rip out that whole subsection of the sheet, because none of it is believable.  And if it applies to gems - surely it applies to all other gear recommendations also?  If it naively thinks that hit is always better even when you're past the hit cap, it will recommend distinctly suboptimal gear based on the (useless) hit rating.<br>
<br>
It's simple to test this: I took my current gear set and just put +8 hit in all gem sockets.  That brings my to (capped) 308 hit rating with one empty trinket slot.  For that trinket slot, it recommends Romulo's poison vial over Bloodlust Brooch, despote the fact that the only thing I'd actually get from the vial is the weak poison proc.<br>
<br>
In summary:  Most raiding rogues operate at or nearly at the hit cap.  Your spreadsheet does not take the hit cap into account when recommending gems or gear, thus severely limiting its utility when used to analyse <i>actual</i> gear choices.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>The recommendations aren't supposed to be taken that seriously. All they do is narrow down your choices for certain slots or sockets.<br>
To find out what's best, you select one item after another and look at the DPS cell (B4) after every change as the DPS calculations factor in the Hit limit. The items and gems that yield the highest amount of DPS are the ones you want to equip.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_504264"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->The issue is, I'm not trying to make a sheet that will tell you what to do.  I am trying to make a sheet to tell you what is good.  And whether you are at the hit cap or not, an item with a lot of hit on it is good.  You may or may not be able to make use of the fact that it's good at this particular moment in time, but it is, in an abstract sense, good.<br>
<br>
For instance, lets say the sheet set the value of hit to zero and thereby stopped recommending it the instant you got to the hit cap.  Lets also suppose that Blizzard then released a trinket with 100 hit rating on it.<br>
<br>
Now, how good is this item in an abstract sense?  Well, really damn good, obviously; it means you can stop socketing for hit at all and dump all that itemization into other stats, and still be hit capped.  The actual long-term benefit you get from having such a trinket is large.  So clearly, this item can reasonably be defined as "good", and we want the spreadsheet to let us know that this is an item worth getting.<br>
<br>
<b>But</b>, under the assumption that the sheet would stop recommending hit the moment you were hit capped, if you were hit capped at the time, the sheet would never tell you about this item.  And for as long as you were hit capped, you would think that this 100 hit item is crap, purely because you can't currently make use of it.<br>
<br>
Stated briefly: the purpose of this sheet is not to replace independent thought.  The purpose of this sheet is not to tell you exactly what you should equip.  And even if that was the purpose of the sheet, it would not be reasonable to expect that all upgrades suggested by the sheet can be made in any order without running into trouble.  The purpose of the sheet is to provide you, the user, with information about what is good... and not.  Armed with the knowledge that certain items are good, and certain items are not, it is left to you, the user, to decide how best to realize the benefit of the good items.<br>
<br>
To be perfectly honest, the very earliest versions of this sheet did detect the hit cap.  When one's miss rate reached zero, the value of hit promptly dropped to zero.  And every time it happened, it confused the heck out of me.   I'd be trying out equipment options, fiddling things around - and it would abruptly inform me that everything I was wearing was crap, and that just about anything I could get my hands on would be an upgrade for every slot.  I found this incredibly confusing every time it happened, and figure, at that point, that if I, who *wrote* the stupid thing was getting confused by the behavior, there was no real chance of anyone else being able to make sense of it.  As such, I decided on the current approach, namely, continuing to inform you that items with a lot of hit on them are good, whether or not you can make use of the hit at the current time.<br>
<br>
With regard to socketing in particular: yes, it could stop recommending hit gems when you're at the hit cap.  But lets consider the implications of this.<br>
<br>
Say you have 260 hit on your gear, neglecting sockets, 10 available sockets, and none of the socket bonuses are worth getting.  Now, clearly socketing all 10 sockets with +8 hit gems is incorrect; this puts you at 340 hit.  <br>
<br>
Well, the first solution to this would be to  just not recommend hit if it puts you over the cap, and thus recommend all +8 agi gems.  But this isn't really the right answer; what we want it to do is recommend hit until you get to the cap, and then agi for the rest of the slots.  What we want it to do is socket 6 of the sockets with +8 hit (for a total of 308 hit) and the other 4 with 8 agi.<br>
<br>
Well, the first question with this is: how is the sheet supposed to decide which slots get 8 agi, and which get 8 hit?  Clearly, if there's socket bonuses on the line, you socket in accordance with those.  But, if there's not, which do you choose?  What goes where?  And, for the matter, why use 6 rigid and 4 delicate instead of 2 rigid and 8 glinting?  or 4 rigid, 4 glinting, and 2 delicate?  Or any other such combination?<br>
<br>
Clearly, there exist circumstances where there are multiple different equivalent ways of socketing stuff, without any particular reason to favor one over the other.  In this situation, the spreadsheet would have to define some convention by which it decided where to put them.  So, lets say the rule is, it starts from the top of the sheet, fills hit till it hits the hit cap, and then sockets the rest with agi.<br>
<br>
But this means, for instance, that the value of the sockets in your boots is going to change based on which helm your wearing, *EVEN IF* your overall stats wind up the same.  And I, for one, would find that horribly confusing.<br>
<br>
Hence, I went the other route.  When comparing the value of items, it assumes that each is socketed optimally.  The value of a socket does not depend on what order the sockets are filled; the sockets are always valued assuming the best possible contents.  This what the middle column tells you: "I believe that this is the best theoretically possible socketing of this item, and thus, to accurately assess the full potential of this item, I am going to compare it to other options based on this socketing".<br>
<br>
So, long story short: this sheet scores items off the maximal potential of each item.  Not all the potential can be realized by every rogue at every time; however, there are complications and confusions that make it more sensible to put the burden on the user to figure out the best solution to that, rather than trying to do it in the sheet.  The sheet is not the ultimate authority on all things; it is simply a tool to help you make good decisions.  But in the end, you are the one that must make the decisions.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
I count 6128 attacks and 137 procs.  Hence, if it's a fixed-percent proc, it's proc rate is between 1.87% and 2.61%.  If, on the other hand, it's PPM, it's about .73 PPM, as a 1 PPM enchant would expect to proc 188 times with a variance of 13 procs.<br>

</div>Hmm, fair enough - that's just a design philosophy difference.  Thing is, by making it "recommend" stuff, you're implying that those items (whether gems or actual items) really do offer an upgrade over existing kit.<br>
<br>
In the example you give, you want to choose whether to socket hit or agility.  I can use my intelligence to know that I shouldn't socket hit past the cap.  However with certain gear combinations, AP or crit might be better than agility.  Your sheet doesn't help me with that: it's too busy recommending the hit I <i>don't</i> need, and not giving me the information I <i>do</i> need (i.e. when I drop hit, should I replace it with agi, AP or crit?)<br>
<br>
And it's not just gem choices - especially as mudflation progresses, I wouldn't be surprised to see itemisation get to the point where +hit will be capped from your gear alone, without looking at gems.  And yet your spreadsheet will still recommend further gear with yet more +hit on, which swamps out the top of the list and thus doesn't show you the gear that might be a <i>real</i> upgrade for you.<br>
<br>
So finding upgrades becomes an immensely tedious process of swapping items in and out manually, and checking to see whether the calculated DPS goes up or down, while paying no attention to the actual recommendations.  This is (I submit) deeply counterintuitive.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>It's a question of gives and takes.  308 is the point you can't use more to hit, but when gear is stacked with loads of other useful stats (crit rating, agility, AP, etc) there comes a point that the hit rating-less gear is still overall better.  <br>
<br>
In other words, on a point-for-point basis, hit rating is better than agility, crit rating, or 2 AP, but item stats don't match up point-for-point.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

There seems to be a fair amount of such gear in the tier 5 and 6 instances. Deathmantle's 24 +hit is a large step down from the 81 +hit from Netherblade. It is not uncommon to drop down towards 200 hit rating, especially if you are progressing fast enough that your gear choices are limited by whatever drops.

</div>Destructive criticism should be shunned, and constructive criticism should always be welcomed.<br>
<br>
I am of the opinion that people could make serious mistakes by going over hit cap. Perhaps you could revert to the previous behaviour where you correctly accounted for hit cap in the rating system, but when you approach/exceed it, have a big bold warning message that activates? Yellow for ~10 close to hit cap, and Red if you exceed?<br>
<br>
*edit: P.S. thank you for the lovely spreadsheet. Your hard work is most certainly welcome. I had created my own fairly extensive spreadsheet pre-BC for my guild's use, and hadn't the time to revamp it for post-BC, and I know how much work it can be.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Always "try on" the gear you're contemplating and see if the rough dps numbers go up, or if you go over the hit cap, etc.  If you're using the sheet mindlessly, you're using it incorrectly.   There are multiple things that YOU need to be aware of - set bonuses, meta gem activation requirements, and the hit cap are the 3 main things to keep in mind that the sheet does not 'automatically' track.

		<div id="post_message_504947"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->First off, one more comment re: Songster.  I'd just like to note that the sheet doesn't actually "recommend" anything.  It "suggests" things.  Now, it's a minor difference, perhaps, but the theory is that it provides you with a list of things that it believes to be good; you can listen to it's suggestions, or not.<br>

</div>First off: there's nothing fundamentally special about being at or near the hit cap; what matters is the total DPS granted by the stats on the items you have equipped.  Getting to the hit cap isn't particularly  more special than getting to 2k unbuffed AP or 30% unbuffed crit: in the end, it's just a number.  So if it turns out that your DPS will be better with less hit because you pick up enough agi/AP/crit/etc. to justify the loss: well, then, you're somewhat under the hit cap.<br>
<br>
Secondly: I personally prefer to keep my hit under 281, which is the hit cap for level 70s.  There is enough level 70 trash (and boss adds) to be killed that not wasting hit on them seems potentially advantageous.  Hence, while I don't actively dump hit to get below 281, nor do I specifically stack it to get above 281.<br>
<br>
Thirdly: while hit is optimal for sustained fights, for interrupted fights it doesn't perform quite as well.  Thus, there exists the school of thought that you might as well just socket for agility in the first place, and not worry as much about hit.  As a general rule, when there are two items of comparable sustained DPS output, it is generally advantageous to select the one with less hit.<br>
<br>
All in all: there are a number of good reasons why one might find oneself below the hit cap<br>
<br>
Regarding criticism: I would encourage people to post any criticism or feedback they may have.  If you don't like the way things work, say so.  It's entirely possible that what's bugging you is something that can be fixed.  And, if it's not, I will explain why it needs to be the way it is.  If you're a dick about it, I might just ignore you, but that's hardly the end of the world either.  Long story short?  Feel free to speak your mind.<br>

		<div id="post_message_504990"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->If you'd like to keep uploading parses, it certainly wouldn't hurt anything.  As for adding it to the spreadsheet: I can certainly put in a reasonable estimate, under the theory of "if it's this hard to tell the difference, how much difference can it actually make?"<br>
<br>
My take on the proc rate situation:<br>
<br>
It appears that the proc rate is most likely either a fixed 2.2% or .75 PPM.  Of those, it seems more plausible to me that it is .75 PPM, under both the "it's a nice round number" theory, and the "pretty much every proc in the game is a PPM" theory.<br>
<br>
So, my inclination is at this point to add it to the spreadsheet as a .75 PPM effect, and call it good for the moment.  If at some point down the road someone feels like doing the SS-only test in Blasted Lands (which, by my estimates, would take roughly 5 hours to be guaranteed to be able to distinguish between the options) it could be updated, but for the moment I'm inclined to say that .75 PPM is probably a good enough estimate.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_506013"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I've tried to read every post to see if this has been discussed however I have not seen the topic.<br>
<br>
The BT rogue exalted trinket combined with a decent amount of passive ArP with the off chance to self buff with the WsC and sitting at 20% hit after talents, is it worth having the BT exalted trinket?  Adding another question, has anyone used the Raid Boss ac chart and teh ArP dmg boost considered with a certain crit rate and ArP level could 2-pc Tier 5 evis bonus finally bring evis to a decent finisher?<br>
<br>
I feel it is easy to keep the buff up and my thought was that with the ArP dropping the boss armor the potential crits on both white and yellow attacks should happen that much for and should hit harder when the WsC procs.  I was not ever having issues with keeping SnD up nor using rupture in a timely fashion to keep the debuff constantly up.  My WWS reports will go up later today allowing me to compare from previous weeks but I was wondering if others may of already invested the time on this topic.  Thanks<br>
<br>

		<div id="post_message_506050"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Its always worth having the BT exhalted trinket for a rogue. You can twist and turn it as you like, it will be always around the top5 if not even top3 in your trinket selection. Taken from mind its a 4%+ crit trinket if you average it out.<br>
<br>
On the Rupture part, i doubt unless Blizzard changes anything with the scaling values, Ruptures DPE will always be bettern than Eviscerate.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_506078"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->thank you for  your post.  To provide a little more background in terms of trinkets, I have had poor luck in getting them and only acquired WsC while raiding BC.  I was using DFT and WsC prior to the exalted trinket and replaced the DFT with the Ashtongue.  My thinking was that the WsC ArP stacking with my passive was far more powerful than 56 ap and the ability to keep the ashtongue buff up provided a good synergy with the ArP.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Except his alternative is DFT, not DST.  So it will recommend Ashtongue and WSC, which are the 2nd and 4th best trinkets in the game for most BT-level rogues.  If you could get a DST (or Madness of the Betrayer) that would replace WSC; but Ashtongue is defenitely worth using.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

The spreadsheet has also been telling me shadow-walker's cord is the best (by a very small 8ap margin over my belt of deep shadow).  I haven't mentioned it because I knew the update was coming up soon and I honestly just don't care that much about an 8ap upgrade when I could use that loot priority for t6 shoulders or legs.<br>

</div>Will do. I will edit this post later with the combat log for that test.<br>
<br>
It will be interesting to see how this new Weapon Skill to Expertise change in 2.3 will affect rogues. I'm worried about losing the +hit bonus from weapon skill as the patch notes only specify a .25% reduction in dodge and parry per point of expertise. Great for tanks, not so great for rogues if that's the case. Barring any changes to the precision talent, wouldn't that raise the hit cap across the board for all races to 363 or something like that?

		<div id="post_message_507028"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Well at first glance the New weapon expertise, looks like it will hurt.  being a human rogue I have 365 weapon skill naturally so the lose of hit will hurt, but it does look like as you get close to capping weapon expertise around 21 skill (I believe) it will be better 5% dodge reduction is nice. <br>
<br>
Basically it will come down to how much Hit will we need and at what cost to other stats.  That is where we will need to test. so basically sense we pretty well know how the current system works time to learn a whole new one :/<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_507170"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->* Re: Shadow-walker's Cord.  In 0.7.7, I think you're just in an unusual area of the gear space where it is actually that good.  In 0.8, there are significant changes being made that will drop it's value further.  It also should be noted that it only wins if you score it with BT gems off; if you allow the competing belts (all of which have 2 sockets) to be socketed with BT gems, Shadow-walker's no longer holds a clear lead.<br>
<br>
* Re: Band of the Eternal Champion.  Standard auto-attack test with one weapon (or two weapons of the same speed) would probably be ideal.  Doing tests at two different speeds (i.e., test with 2x1.3 speed weapons, and then do another test with 2x2.6 speed weapons) would also potentially be interesting.  The only reason why Warglaives needs the more complicated thing is the inability to test with a single weapon or two weapons of the same speed.<br>
<br>
* Re: Expertise.  Well, since they're telling us exactly what it does, I think the most important thing is going to be establish what the base miss and dodge rates of level 73s are.  This is going to involve stacking increasingly ludicrous amounts of +hit and fighting boss-level mobs until you stop missing.  Whether it will be possible to do the same with expertise and dodge rate remains to be seen; we'll have to see what itemization looks like.  Observations so far:<br>
<br>
1) Paladins weapon skill talent gives both expertise and stamina; it's entirely possible that WEx will give more than just Expertise.<br>
<br>
2) If it does just give expertise, it goes from it's current behavior where it gives +3.5% hit, +.4% crit, +.4% enemy dodge (we think) to a straight 2.5% dodge reduction.  This is certainly a nerf, but not necessarily an overwhelming one.  And, past the first 5 points, Expertise is actually more powerful than Weapon Skill.<br>
<br>
Long story short: we'll have to see what happens.  Starting with what the new talent does, and moving quickly into what the hit/expertise caps are.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_507701"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->So, here's the deal.  I now have all the mechanics changes made in the sheet, plus a few assorted other adjustments.  What I don't have is any of the UI improvements (stat summary block, etc.).  And, as you may have noticed, there's a patch coming out shortly.<br>
<br>
So, the question is: would you like the current incarnation of the sheet now (well, tomorrow morning, but, same idea)... or would you prefer that I wait a few days, finish the UI adjustments, and add Warglaive set bonus, Band of the Eternal Champion, and the new 2.3 loot before releasing?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_507712"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Hey Aldriana, I'm a bit slow but it occurred to me that since energy is a scarce source of ours, never losing energy from dodged sinisters could be a potentially very powerful boost (possibly helping offset the raised hit cap, if it is indeed raised)<br>
<br>
How hard would it be to figure out how much dps you'd gain from never having your sinisters dodged?  With your gear for example.  I forget exactly how much energy we lose on a dodged sinister strike 8?  12?  Hell with never being dodged many of us in that limbo area between 3s/5r and 4s/5r might find it possible to actually pull off 3s/5r.  Maybe I'm just dreaming :-)<br>

		<div id="post_message_507754"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->To clarify the tradeoff: cleaning stuff up for release is sort of a nuisance, so I'd prefer not to do it more often that I have to.  Hence, if I release what I have now, there probably won't be another full version (other than fixes) until we've nailed down all the 2.3 stuff.  So the question is: everything for 2.2 now, and nothing for 2.3 for a couple weeks... or some limited amount of 2.3 stuff in a couple days.<br>
<br>
Regarding dodged Sinister Strikes: minimal effect.  Sinister Strike that never gets dodged would be roughly a 1% increase to your sinister strike damage, and hence about 4-5 DPS total.  Not really that big a deal.<br>
<br>
Ballpark figures for those who are just that curious:<br>
Warglaive Set Bonus: ~300 AP<br>
Band of the Eternal Champion: about 12 AP ahead of the Revered Band of Eternity, aka just barely ahead of Band of the Ranger-General and Band of Lethality in weighted total, though behind both in raw DPS.<br>
Excutioner Enchant: assuming PPM the same as Mongoose, it's likely just slightly more damage (though less defensive mods) than Mongoose - hence, in weighted total, about the same.  Not worth reenchanting for, but for a new piece of gear, it may be worth using.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Yes, the hit cap may end up being a fair amount higher, but we can also mitigate dodge more than ever before.  Again: if WEx does anything other than +10 Expertise, there's a very good chance that we'll wind up with a net buff out of this.<br>
<br>
Of course, if it doesn't do anything else, then, yes, it's a nerf.  But it's a reasonably small one, and certainly no reason to go into "the sky is falling!" mode.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_508213"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Just posting to concur with Nilme's assessments. Essentially, anyone still in SSC/TK will be taking the bracers as an upgrade over anything available at that point, and anyone in any guild will want the boots, which are simply amazing.<br>
<br>
As far as the pants go, they are certainly better than T4, but not by enough to warrant the cost, in my opinion. For a T5 rogue, they certainly won't be worth it because, at least personally, I'd rather keep the 4/5 T5 bonus than use those haste pants, and Bloodsea Brigand's is better than T5 chest, so the pants have to go. There's also a pair of haste gloves, they seem to be, like the pants, roughly between T4 and T5 in quality.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_508264"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Hmm, there's no clear melee dps neck reward there. Unless they expect us to use the "tanking" one... But I don't see how 22hit and 21 expertise rating would beat Vile Intent. <br>
<br>
The boots... Well they are itemized incredibly well. But imo the blue socket makes Nyn'jah's Tabi boots somewhat inferior to Shadowmaster's. <br>
<br>
Let's say for combat you'd socket with orange/yellow/purple you'd end up with:<br>
<br>
35agi, 38stam, 15 hit, 20crit, 76ap (Pyrestone/Lionseye)<br>
vs<br>
39agi, 28stam, 30hit, 0crit, 60ap. (Shadowsong/Pyrestone)<br>
<br>
Coming down to:<br>
4agi, 15hit vs 20crit and 16ap.<br>
<br>
Socketing 2x Lionseye might change it a bit. <br>
Very close, but I'll be sticking to my Shadowmaster's, better for mutilate anyway.  <br>
<br>
Bracers are really nice, but all the other pieces (ugh... haste) are somewhat lackluster to be honest. Looking at the caster and feral druid pieces I'm somewhat disappointed in the rogue ones.<br>
<br>
Both the melee trinkets are nothing special either, but probably worth using over the Talisman (if you have that). WSC/TT or Madness (and Renataki of course) will still be better choices for pvp. <br>
<br>
The cloak is rather nice, excellent alternative to Teron cloak for pvp. Still it's 60 badge's which is kinda smeh. You wouldn't probably use it over Drape of the Dark Reavers for pve. So for a purely pvp semi-upgrade it's a tad bit expensive imho. <br>
<br>
I'd be interested in seeing the S3 weapons as well as the honor boots/belt/bracers. If they feature any armor reduction, then stacking that might offer some interesting results. Probably not enough to outdo BT items but depending on the weapon dps and it's stats (~~100-104dps s2 stats+ 120 armor reduction would be very very nice.)<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

1) Expertise is, point-for-point, almost exactly equivalent to Hit Rating.  So for those of you wanting to do estimates in the meantime, plugging Expertise as extra hit rating will make a pretty good approximation of worth.<br>
2) Brooch of Deftness is significantly inferior to Choker of Vile Intent<br>
3) Dory's Embrace ranks 4th in overall cloak quality, about 10 AP behind Drape of the Dark Reavers.  It is 5th in DPS, also behind Vegeance Wrap.<br>
4) All the new trinkets are useless for PvE.<br>
5) Is anyone else mildly annoyed that they've implemented 3 new feral druid belts but no new rogue belt?<br>
6) Shallow Grave Trousers are comparable to Leggings of Murderous Intent, Deathmantle Legguards, and Skulker's Greaves.  Hence, if you have one of those 3, they're probably not worth getting; if you don't, they are a reasonable upgrade over other options.<br>
7) Trickster's Stickyfingers are a nice intermediate between T4 and T5, where there was previously a considerable gap.<br>
8) Nyn'jah Tabi Boots are only slightly inferior to Shadowmaster's Treads, and certainly far better than anything else.<br>
9) Master Assassin Wraps are the best bracers pre-Hyjal.  By a lot.  But they are behind Insidious, Deadly, and Swiftstrike.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_508721"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I Still find it funny that we are debating boots from the second "raid" (used loosely since it is a 10 man) boss we would fight in this game as the best boots in the game. But i am glad i saved those 41 badges, and didn't burn them on the broach, cause that would be another 90 badges i would need to farm.<br>
<br>
One thing I am disappointed about is the fact that they didn't add an offhand sword to the Badge table. That is what I was really hoping for, but now that i think about it, they should have added an offhand for every weapon spec except for Daggers. To give people an non high end raid/pvp way to obtain offhands that are actually fast. I am very happy with my decision to farm the <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=29275" target="_blank">[Searing Sunblade]</a> and i think other specs should have had that same option and not be forced to pvp for offhands.<br>
<br>
It also forces me to stay daggers. As much as i love my daggers, i can't really switch because my only other fast offands are the <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=27901" target="_blank">[Blackout Truncheon]</a> and <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28189" target="_blank">[Latro's Shifting Sword]</a> and those are really going to help my dps. I guess i could try the ever popular Sword/Dagger spec.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_508851"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Excellent update Aldriana!<br>
<br>
However, I noticed a new little quirk with how gem slots work, and I'm not sure you intended for them to function this way.<br>
<br>
When I downloaded the new version and was going through switching from your gear to mine, I noticed that when I switched a piece of gear that had more/less or different colored gem slots, the spreadsheet didn't actually recognize the discrepancy until I clicked on a gem slot that was either supposed to exist but didn't, or didn't exist but should have.  <br>
<br>
A good example is going from your Swiftstrike Bracers to my Veteran's Leather Bracers, I gain a yellow gem slot.  Merely switching the item didn't reveal my new gem slot, however; I had to click on a grayed-out gem slot to cause it to activate itself.<br>
<br>
Also, when switching to a piece of gear with fewer gem slots than its predecessor, the recommended gem slots will not change from what was in them before (so if I go from, say, Bladed Shoulderpads of the Merciless to Shoulderpads of the Stranger, I will have two gems in the recommended slots, but only one available socket slot.<br>
<br>
I didn't notice this in your 0.8 update post, but I apologize if it was mentioned previously.  I'm posting during my work break, so I didn't go back and comb through all the older replies.<br>
<br>

It's not a sheet-breaking problem; I can still make full use of it by just clicking all gem slots individually after changing an item to refresh them.  I'll keep trying different things to see if I can pinpoint what is causing the problem for me, though.<br>
<br>
Is this happening to anyone else, or just me?<br>
<br>
2nd edit:  The problem is actually worse than I originally noticed.  I re-downloaded the sheet to make sure it wasn't just a fluke and that I hadn't downloaded the wrong version by mistake, and the problem reappeared.<br>
<br>
No matter what I change, in any field, the rough DPS does not change.  I tried changing talents, gems, gear, enchants, and buffs, but nothing I changed made any difference.  I just got done going through and removing every piece of gear, zeroing out all talents, and removing all buffs.  Despite all that, the Rough DPS did not change and I still see the same values in Suggested Gems and "Socket Bonus?" as I did with a  fully populated sheet.<br>

I typed a lot and then realized I was wrong, but I want to notice the nerf to my trinkets effect on my dps.  <br>
<br>
I looked into it and noticed that you were only off by 100armor on your assumption (assuming 7700 armor -2600 for 5SA you get 5100 armor on most bosses).  That said, using the tabs in .8 to get 5SA up + the 7700 base armor of the boss (still equal to 5100, correct?) I am still seeing close to a 50DPS difference, in favor of .8.<br>

</div>The new version seems to have my gear entered rather than yours, but when I update it to have the exact same gear as the 0.7.7 you posted, I get a DPS total of 1443.83 for 0.7.7 and 1379.41 for 0.8, which seems about right to me.

</div>Right, and that's the key point.  At the moment there's roughly a 5% chance that a SS will be dodged.  If it's dodged, you lose 8 energy and get to try again; hence, the averaged energy required to get an SS to actually go off is 32+8/.95 (or so) - pulling the actual number from the spreadsheet, with the default gear this works out to an expected 40.44 energy per SS.  If we were never dodged, it would be 40 energy per SS, a reduction in cost by about the 1 percent sited earlier.  The bigger advantage is that it's less disruptive to your cycles, as there are circumstances where having to make a 2nd (or 3rd) try to land the SS will cause your SnD to lapse for a second or your energy to cap out.  This isn't modeled in the sheet, though.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">More quick thoughts and estimates regarding 2.3 gear:<br>
<br>
1) Expertise is, point-for-point, almost exactly equivalent to Hit Rating.  So for those of you wanting to do estimates in the meantime, plugging Expertise as extra hit rating will make a pretty good approximation of worth.<br>
8) Nyn'jah Tabi Boots are only slightly inferior to Shadowmaster's Treads, and certainly far better than anything else.</div>

	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div><br>
1) Do I understand correctly that 1 weapon skill was better then 1 hitrating so this is another nerf for rogues?<br>
8) Far better? Comparing Edgewalker they only offer +6 hit, +16 AP and -7 stam. The fact that you need a blue gem makes the socketbonus pretty useless as there are no good blue dps gems. Better I agree.. but far better? Hardly imho.<br>
On the other hand there is offcourse no other boots upgrade from the 2nd boss in KZ (edgewalker) to the 7th (?) boss in Black Temple (Shadowmaster's Boots). :/<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_509500"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->The first 5 points of weapon skill were better than hit; hence, this is a nerf to combat rogues.  However, after the first 5 points, Hit was better than weapon skill, and, thus, expertise is also better than weapon skill after the first 5 points.  Hence, items with weapon skill are more powerful now than before, but, assuming they haven't changed the base miss/dodge rate against level 73s, yes, rogues will experience a slight reduction of DPS.  However, I do mean "slight".  We're talking on the order of 10-20 DPS, I suspect.<br>
<br>
Regarding Nyn'jah Tabi: Yes, blue gems suck for DPS.  This is why you ignore the socket bonus and socket with your favorite combination of red and yellow gems.  Hence, the comparison is 6 hit and 16 AP vs 7 sta.  6 hit, depending on your gear, is worth roughly 15 AP.  7 sta, according to the weighting in the sheet, is about 4 AP-equivalent.  Hence, Nyn'jah Tabi is roughly a 27 AP upgrade relative to Edgewalker Longboots.<br>
<br>
Now, is 27 AP an ultra-collosal mega-upgrade?  No, it's not.  But when the 2nd and 3rd place items differ by 27 AP, that's pretty significant.  Consider: the 2nd-best and 7th-best necks are separated by only 25 AP.  The 2nd-best and 6th-best shoulder are separated by 28 AP.  The 2nd and 6th best cloaks are separated by 28 AP.  The 2nd and 5th best bracers are separated by 28 AP.  The 1st and 4th best belts are separated by only 14 AP.  The 2nd and 6th best legs are separated by 24 AP.  The 3rd and 9th best rings are separated by only 24 AP.  So when the 2nd and 3rd items are more disparate in quality than the 2nd and 6th are for many slots, I would argue that that qualifies as "far better".  If you want to mince words and say it's merely "clearly better" or "obviously better", so be it.  The fact remains: it is a significant and obvious upgrade over everything else, and for me there are only a handful of available upgrades in the entire game that are a larger boost.  Any rogue that doesn't have BT on farm (and even a lot of the ones that *do*) should be working on getting these boots.    So, they're good.  If you want to pick a different adjective for just how good, you're welcome to do so.  But I stand by my choice .<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_509525"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Mace Spec is being changed to 1% extra damage on all crits per point. So at 5/5 it offers a 5% chance to stun blablabla and 5% extra damage on critical strikes.<br>
I'm almost falling over my keyboard(wtb more sleep time) so my brain cannot figure yet how good is this or how much it sucks.<br>
<br>
RED gives me about 25 dps. Adding and removing dexerity(12agi) from boots yields a 7dps decrease so I guess RED(red - 12agi) is worth about 18dps or 6dps per 1%crit damage. so 5% crit damage would net me about 30dps. Sword spec is worth about ~74dps and fist spec ~55dps. I guess none of these calculations are valid since crit damage increase is not linear but at least the new mace spec gives some dps increase the previous one didn't <br>
<br>
Now I'm willing to bet that dragonstrike with new mace spec will beat S2 Fists and will be on par with S2 Swords. If this is true I might try to get the last 2 vortices I need :-)<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Kinda sad I was to cheap to spend dkp on the vashj belt now lol. Was a minor upgrade, now it'll be the belt that owns them all. <br>
Btw.. If I look at <a class="itemlink q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30106" target="_blank">[Belt of One-Hundred Deaths]</a> (wowhead 2.3: <a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30106" target="_blank">Belt of One-Hundred Deaths - Items - World of Warcraft</a>) then the skill rating simply gets removed without anything else replacing it. Has anybody managed to get onto PTR to verify this? <a class="itemlink q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30103" target="_blank">[Fang of Vashj]</a> is the same, no stats changed other then the removal of the daggerskill.<br>
That would mean <a class="itemlink q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30879" target="_blank">[Don Alejandro's Money Belt]</a> would become the undisputed best belt ingame.<br>
<br>
I'm unsure though.. as a human rogue with 2/2WE I only needed 300 +hit to cap (308 for non-humans). Now I'll be needing 363 - (10expertise x 15.7) = 324 +hit. (I am correct in assuming that the mob having less dodge is the same as me having more hit right?)<br>
<br>
However the WE talent now also gives 2.5% less parry which we had a static 5% before 2.3 which no ammount of +hit could change (very unsure off this so don't take this for truth and do correct/confirm me if you know).<br>
If this 5% parry chance I have in my head for some reason is true.. isn't this -2.5% to parry worth as much as +2.5% +hit then? I doubt I'm right caus this would make expertise seriously better and bliz buffing rogues can't be right. Anyway, I'd realy appreciate it if somebody could explain the details where I'm wrong and what is right.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Mace Spec is being changed to 1% extra damage on all crits per point. So at 5/5 it offers a 5% chance to stun blablabla and 5% extra damage on critical strikes.<br>
I'm almost falling over my keyboard(wtb more sleep time) so my brain cannot figure yet how good is this or how much it sucks.<br>
<br>
RED gives me about 25 dps. Adding and removing dexerity(12agi) from boots yields a 7dps decrease so I guess RED(red - 12agi) is worth about 18dps or 6dps per 1%crit damage. so 5% crit damage would net me about 30dps. Sword spec is worth about ~74dps and fist spec ~55dps. I guess none of these calculations are valid since crit damage increase is not linear but at least the new mace spec gives some dps increase the previous one didn't <br>
<br>
Now I'm willing to bet that dragonstrike with new mace spec will beat S2 Fists and will be on par with S2 Swords. If this is true I might try to get the last 2 vortices I need :-)</div>

So I would say it's quite disputed. Right now I have 2 +10 hit gems in the belt of deep shadows and 2 +5agi/5hit on Don Alenjandro's, so I can switch them about depending on my needs. I've heard multiple people refer to DA's as the second best belt in the game behind Vashj, but why is it? and why does it not show up in the sheets?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I have a couple of questions concerning the recently uploaded version of your spreadsheet. In the Xs5r tab, under the 'Actual Attack Counts' section, the 'MH Procs Per PPM' cells (row 276) refer to the 'MH Atts' cells (row 257). Should this be 'MH Hits' (row 260) instead? In the previous sections the 'MH Procs Per PPM' cells referenced the latter cells.<br>
<br>
Also, in the iterative sections, is blade flurry taken into account? I did not notice a reference to it until the 'Actual Attack Accounts' section.<br>

</div>1) Yes, it should point to MH hits.  I'll fix it in the next version.  In the meantime, the sheet will slightly overvalue PPM effects.<br>
<br>
2) Blade Flurry (and Heroism, and Haste Pots/Drums, and Adrenaline Rush) aren't factored in during the iterative portion.  The reason for this is that one can't realistically adjust one's cycle based on a buff you receive only once every 2 minutes.  So you get the benefit of the extra attacks/energy from a damage perspective, but you don't get to contract your cycle based on them, which I would argue is a pretty effective model of how things work; AR doesn't let you drop your cycle from 3.3s5r to 2.8s5r (or whatever) - you do your normal cycle most of the time, and just squeeze in a bunch of extra Sinister Strikes (and maybe an Eviscerate or something) during the AR itself, and then go back to your regular cycle.<br>
<br>
3) The spreadsheet doesn't factor in PPM effects based on rupture, since, to my knowledge, no one has ever figured out what the proc behavior of finishers is.<br>

</div>Well, from the perspective of a combat rogue who is past the big hump of the first 5 points of combat skill anyway, the human racial currently gives .5% hit, .2% crit, and .2% dodge, according to the model in this sheet.  Is 1% crit better than that?  I would argue that it is, just barely.  Converting things to rating points and scoring them in the spreadsheet, my count is that the current human racial is worth 39.1 AP for a combat rogue (at least, one that's wearing my gear), and the new one will be worth 43.2 AP.  So, yes, slightly less for humans.<br>

</div>20/41 comes on top with Gear Spreadsheet with 33,99dps, on DPS Spreadsheet (other thread) about 40dps ahead. If you use Hemo Debuff DPS Estimate on DPS Spreadsheet 11/21/29 comes on top with ~28dps.<br>

Dont know which conclusion to make from these, 11/21/29 might be better for raiding or? Anyone with more experience from hemo?<br>

</div>Ground the numbers on these, and the answer appears to be that it's a 1 PPM effect with a 60 sec internal cooldown.  Details available upon request, but it's fairly unambiguous.  With that proc behavior and my gear, the spreadsheet predicts 12.6% uptime on the proc, which matches well with the 13% you found in practice; hence the estimates I made before are probably pretty good.  I will add the ring to the next version of the sheet.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_510900"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I've been considering the spec as well, though I wasn't planning to drop Relentless (It's just too good. Single best point we can spend), Dirty Deeds is really only worth like 20-25 dps per point, average though. Obviously I'd value it higher since usually the low end of a mob's life is when you need more damage (Though not always, Solarian for instance), but still it's not amazing point for point. I was showing Deadliness better than Sword spec as well, though you then miss out on Blade Flurry (Which I was considering over Prep, even though I would miss Prep a great deal. I can only assume BF every 2 minutes beats vanishing a few times and garroting for dps).<br>
<br>
All in all, I don't see it mathematically competing with Combat to the highest level, but it should perform just fine. I intend to give it a shot and see - absolutely loved Hemo back in Naxx with the MSA, and I feel like the dirty Deeds change should push it just enough to perform at least.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Coincidentally, I have a little spreadsheet that whips out damage per energy calculations for Eviscerate and Rupture based on all your stats, and also allows you to calculate your raid buffed stats, to simulate exactly what you're talking about. As a sword build, with raid-buffed stats of 36% crit (plus RED), 3330 AP (time averaged), and hell, let's even throw in 2-piece Deathmantle and 3/3 Imp Evis, 5-CP Eviscerate is only 83.40 DPE against 0 armor, while Rupture is still 93.55.<br>
<br>
There is basically no point where Evis catches up to Rupture because even with Imp Evis and realistically achievable amounts of crit, it just doesn't scale as well with AP, plus it costs 35 energy to Rupture's 25.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>So, your armory currently has a Riding Crop equipped, so I can't be sure what your usual 2nd trinket is, but the only selection I can find that makes the recommendation 5s3r would be Dragonspine Trophy, so I'm going to assume that for the moment.<br>
<br>
With your gear as listed in Armory + Dragonspine Trophy, the cycle recommendation is 5s3r.  According to the sheet, this should be sustainable with SnD uptime of 99.7%; that is, it will drop occasionally, but for the most part it will be up.  So, first question: is this reasonable?<br>
<br>
Well, lets see.  To execute a 5s3r cycle with 2/3 Ruthlessness requires an average of 7.2 backstabs per cycle, which takes 432 energy.  It also costs 10 net energy to launch a 3 point rupture, so the total energy requirement is 442 energy.  With 2/5 T4, a 5-pt SnD lasts 34.8 seconds; hence, for this to be sustainable from a theoretical perspective, one needs to generate 442/34.8 = 12.7 energy per second.  Your hit rate is about 95% (&lt;1% miss chance, 5% dodge chance), and you are attacking with a 1.4 speed weapon.  With SnD, this works out to .88 hits per second or so, which is 2.65 energy per second, plus the baseline regen of 10 is 12.65.  Compare to the 12.7 needed, and recalling that we never factored in the extra energy procs from Dragonspine Trophy... all in all, this looks more or less sustainable in the average case.<br>
<br>
Now, in practice, energy regen isn't that smooth.  Ruthlessness can fail to proc a couple times in a row, Combat Potency can have a dry spell, and so on.  So, in practice, yes, this cycle, like all tight cycles, may have issues with sustainability; the energy bar is not large enough to let you smooth out these differences in the long-term average case; particularly as a dagger rogue, which limits the size of the energy buffer you can reasonably sustain.<br>
<br>
Thus, while this cycle is theoretically possible, I probably wouldn't use it in reality.  Instead, I would do one of two things:<br>
<br>
1) Use 5s5r3s instead, which will be far more sustainable and has average-case DPS less than 1 DPS behind 5s3r, or<br>
2) Drop another point from Lethality to get 3/3 Ruthlessness, which will allow you to trim your cycle down to 1s3r (with the occasional 4-point rupture if Combat Potency/Ruthlessness give you a nice spike), which has sustained DPS that is also comparable and much less likely to drop SnD uptime.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>HMM so it looks like, raid buffed, you'd have to get it wayyy below 15% mitigation to have the same level of DPE than ruputure.  :\  Just wondering, noticed a lot of armor pen available, plus the rise in crit would mean an improvement, not to mention, if you include mangle into the equation, rupture gaines even more dpe probably... :\<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Based on figures in posts 942 and 943 I mimicked the math but subbed in 3k ap rather than 2500 and assumed the same crit rate of 30% (which to be fair should probably be higher).  Assuming 25% armor mitigation 30% crit and full evic buffs + 2pc t5, which I think is generous I came up with the following:<br>
<br>
2014.5 average evic dmg after 25% armor mitigation.<br>
1721 avg rupture dmg (with mangle)<br>

You made a mistake in your rupture's value :<br>
1000 + 3000*0.24 = 1720.<br>
<br>
Therefore, your 1720 avg rupture is <u>without</u> mangle.<br>
With mangle it turns to be a 2236 avg rupture, with a 89.44 DPE without any poison value.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Ah I follow you.  It's interesting because for my gear it has belt of deepshadows ahead from an "Offensive" weighted standpoint by a smidge (2 AP) even before any gems are placed in the belt.  After rigid dawnstones Deep shadows is ahead like 12 AP equivalents.  Perhaps also I just have a fair amount of stam overall and I don't feel the need for the stam on the Akama belt.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_512116"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->When I equip Deep Shadows, gemmed as it is right now, I gain ~2 dps relative to Shadowwalker's, and lose 24 stamina.  This would drop me from my current ~9500 unbuffed to ~9300.  And, fundamentally, there's enough incidental damage on most of these fights that having the extra cushion strikes me as nice.  I mean, it's not truly *essential* on most fights, but it increases your chances of surviving a bad combination of 2 or more of Blizzard/Flamestrike/Consecrate/Deadly Poison on Council, Provides cushion on phases 2 and 3 of Reliquary (and phase 1 as well, depending on your strategy), and so on.  There's only about 3 fights in Hyjal/BT where I *don't* find that extra HP are useful  - Kaz'rogal, Teron, and Gurtogg.  <br>
<br>
So, again, tradeoffs, as always. If we were talking 10 DPS vs 24 sta, my answer would be different.  But 2 DPS vs 24 sta?  I find it hard to argue that's not worth it.<br>
<br>
In other news: I punched the new ZA loot into my spreadsheet, and it appears that the most interesting piece of loot in the instance, from a rogue's perspective, is Signet of Primal Wrath, which is second only to Stormrage's Signet Ring in terms of overall quality, ranking just slightly ahead of Ring of Deceitful Intent in terms of weighted total (and about 10 AP ahead in terms of raw DPS).  Most of the rest of the loot weighs in about where you'd expect: better than Karazhan loot, but slightly inferior to SSC/TK loot.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Not really, no.  In addition to moving all the forumlas, you need to redefine the named ranges to include the new items.  Also, copying the forumlas straight over tends not to work exactly, since not all the formulas have dollar signs everywhere they're needed to make the formulas directly copy.<br>
<br>
Honestly, given the frequency with which new releases of the sheet are coming out right now, the recommended way of getting an item into the sheet is to post it in this thread, and I'll add it the next release (assuming it strikes me as worth adding, anyway - again, I'm trying to limit this to 5-man blues and up).</div>

	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>Actually I was able to add new items pretty easily and the formula's worked fine.<br>
<br>
All I had to do after unhiding the sheets I needed was to insert a new row right before the last line of that equipment slot.  Then just copy/paste the cells using formulas, entered the stats etc...<br>
<br>
As for the drop location, that was a bit trickier.  I just used existing ones (didnt think you could just add a new location and get it to show due to the check boxes on the main page).  Examples:<br>
 for Zul'Aman gear I just labeled it as dropping in Kara for now.  <br>
for my Assassination gear I just labeled it as 5 mans.<br>
for the new Heroic Badge loots, I just labeled it as heroics.<br>
<br>
This is all a temporary fix till a new sheet comes out but worked fine for me.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_515194"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->sadly, the best OH weapon I have right now is the Malchazeen.  Any chance that the gear spreadsheet can be accomodated for weapons like this, that are decent, but not the best choice in a particular slot.  As a point of reference, I play a Combat spec and do fairly well in the meters.  My dilemma  with your spreadsheet is that i cannot get an accurate optimal HIT with the current OH dagger.  I know..get a decent sword, and I am working on it.  No time for PvP, will look to 2.3 and the new OH there, but for the meantime this is what i have to work with.<br>

		<div id="post_message_515294"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Malchazeen is NOT a decent off hander for a combat sword build, and probably not for any combat build at all. There a plenty of blues (especially Latros comes to mind) and probably even some green weapons that would be better suited.<br>
Anyway, you can manually add Malchazeen as an off hander. Right click on the Talent_Equipment tab at the bottom left corner of your Excel window. Select Show, mark Weapons and click Okay. In the Weapons sheet, you can simply replace the values of any off hand dagger to those of Malchazeen.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_515464"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->So, a few quick words on OHs:<br>
<br>
As a general rule, each .1 speed on the OH is worth about 10 DPS on it; and being a sword is worth more like 20.  Hence, Malchazeen is comparable to (well, probably slightly superior to due to stats, but definitely in the same ballpark as) <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=23132" target="_blank">[Lord Blackwood's Blade]</a>.  And hence inferior to: <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28189" target="_blank">[Latro's Shifting Sword]</a>, <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28311" target="_blank">[Revenger]</a>, and <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=25952" target="_blank">[Scimitar of the Nexus-Stalkers]</a>.  In the realm of daggers, there are a reasonable number that would be better as well, notably <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28345" target="_blank">[Warp Splinter's Thorn]</a>, <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28226" target="_blank">[Timeslicer]</a>, <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=27814" target="_blank">[Twinblade of Mastery]</a>, and <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28955" target="_blank">[Grand Marshal's Shiv]</a>. And, of course, obviously there are any number of epics that would be superior as well.<br>
<br>
Long story short: Malchazeen is a terrible terrible OH, and thus it, specifically, will never be in this sheet as an OH.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_515572"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->While you're at it, could you hack the spreadsheet to support a mace/sword spec for 2.3? Unlike Lethality, mace spec will not just increase the critical damage bonus, but also the base damage (e.g. 100 non crit will cause 210 damage with mace spec). This effect seems to stack multiplicative with Lethality, although I am not 100% sure about this anymore... I lost my scrap paper :/<br>
As you usually run aroud with approx. 40% Crit, I could imagine this to be equal to sword/sword spec.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Basically, the ranking of top-end MH weapons looks something like this:<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">While you're at it, could you hack the spreadsheet to support a mace/sword spec for 2.3? Unlike Lethality, mace spec will not just increase the critical damage bonus, but also the base damage (e.g. 100 non crit will cause 210 damage with mace spec). This effect seems to stack multiplicative with Lethality, although I am not 100% sure about this anymore... I lost my scrap paper :/<br>
As you usually run aroud with approx. 40% Crit, I could imagine this to be equal to sword/sword spec.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>The spreadsheet already supports hybrid builds such as mace/sword.  It doesn't have the new mace spec in yet, but yes, that will be added for 2.3.  However, it's still inferior; the increased critical damage, while nice, is simply not up to the part of sword and fist specs for PvE (though quite nice in PvP, as I understand it).  Consider:<br>
<br>
Say 40% of your attacks are crits.  In practice, my crit rate is rarely that high, but lets go with it.  That means that with 5/5 mace spec, 40% of your attacks will do an extra 10% of your base damage; hence you effectively gain 4% of your base damage per attack.<br>
<br>
Fist Spec adds 100% of your base damage to 5% of attacks; hence, you effectively gain 5% of your base damage per attack.<br>
<br>
Hence, even at 40% crit rate, fist spec is superior to mace spec.  And to get crit rate even that high generally requires T6 quality gear (unless you're gimping yourself on hit/AP, anyway).  And Maces have the added problem that the post-T5 itemization for them stinks; Dragonstrike is the best mace in the game.  So, in the long run, swords are still the way to go.<br>

</div>DPS. Please never use the words "top end" as if they referred to anything meaningful. Speed doesn't matter for white damage, only for Sinister Strike (due to weapon speed normalization), and 0.1 speed on a main hand is certainly not greater than 7 DPS (I believe I found it to be around 3 DPS, roughly), even if you factor in the stat difference.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Top end damage is meaningless.  Average damage and damage per second are the only relevant stats.  Since the Arena 3 MH has more DPS and higher average damage than Blade of Infamy, with comparable stats, it's not hard to see why it would be better.<br>
<br>
Mind you, it's not better by a heck of a lot; we're talking maybe 15 AP relative to BoI and maybe 25 relative to Talon.  So while it's definitely better, it's not "any rogue who isn't rated 1850 (or whatever it is) or higher in arena is gimped for PvE" better.  It helps.  But if you don't PvP, it's not that much of a disadvantage.<br>
<br>
While we're on the topic: the reason slow weapons are better is not related to taking better advantage of AP on autoattacks; it's related to 1) higher average SS damage and 2) higher average Sword Spec/Windfury procs.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>There's a lot of misinformation about this, and I've laid out my opinion in most of the relevant threads if you want to look for it, but the gist of it is this:<br>
<br>
Assuming you had an otherwise identical talent spec, fist/sword would do comparable or just barely more damage than sword/sword assuming weapons of equal quality.  However, in practice, you don't have an otherwise identical talent spec, and the talent points you lose cost you more damage than any benefit you may glean from the fist/sword combination; as such, while fist/sword is a viable alternative if you don't have a good MH sword, I can't think of any reason why one would actively choose to use fists while swords were available; as such, if you have the arena points to get a MH weapon, I can't think of any reason to select the fist over the sword, since it results in an overall spec that is inferior.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Alright, well then I've been horribly misinformed and will correct these people swiftly..lol<br>
<br>
Another thing, I'm using the spiteblade now (I get the first ToA that drops..when it finally drops), but i've gone against two rogues, both with comparable stats, one using S1 MH and one using S2 MH and beat them both, usually handily, of course they still think evisc is a better finisher &gt;.&gt;.  Wouldn't the S1 be an upgrade over the spiteblade since it has a higher avg and higher dps? <br>
<br>
Also, is the Blade of Infamy a considerable upgrade over ToA, not that hit is valued slightly lower than agi? Just wondering, because we're about to kill kael hopefully, and I'd rather take the first BoA if I know its a considerable upgrade or if it's only slight, I'll stick with ToA.</div>

</div>It's a fairly small upgrade on the whole; on the other hand, it's the best there is until Warglaives.  So while I wouldn't take it from someone who still has a MH from a T4 instance, it's certainly a nice upgrade to pick up at some point.<br>

</div>Rod of the Sun King is 1 PPM; see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080306033525/http://elitistjerks.com/f31/t14375-rogue_mechanics_testing_thread/" target="_blank">http://elitistjerks.com/f31/t14375-r...esting_thread/</a>.  Post 26 has the raw data in it.<br>
<br>
Regarding the value of it versus Dragonstrike: it depends on your current gear.  They're pretty close on the whole, but my experience with this is that Dragonstrike is a bit ahead for most people.<br>
<br>
...Although, upon taking a second look at it, I just realized that I neglected to update Rod of the Sun King for the new PPM findings, so it's actually a bit overvalued right now.  As usual, will be fixed in the next revision.</div>

<br>
First let me thank you for all of your hard work and care in putting together and maintaining this spreadsheet during your free time.  I think that I can speak for many players when I say that your sheet has been an invaluable tool in helping us to make gear decisions.<br>
<br>
My question is in regard to the DPS estimate on your spreadsheet.  In practice, my DPS in raids varies quite a bit around your estimate depending on the particular fight: tank threat generation, being incapacitated, etc.  I am wondering if your DPS estimate includes energy use for feint and, if so, how often?  I find that on some bosses my threat total easily nears that of our main tank and I spend considerable time feinting or delaying special attacks (sometimes wasting energy ticks).  Thus, my DPS for these fights according to our WWS parses comes out a bit lower than projected on your spreadsheet.  If you do not currently include feint do you have plans to include it?  I realize that the use of this ability is both situational and personal and therefore difficult to model.<br>
<br>
I apologize if this topic has been previously discussed, but I did not find much information regarding feint in this thread (the search tool provided two posts).  In case this information is of use for your answer, our raid uses Omen to estimate threat and I generally save Vanish for ~80% boss health, after using major cooldowns.  I also use the cycle suggestion on your sheet and in fights without threat (e.g. Akama, Gurtogg phase 2, RoS phase 1) my DPS is much higher than your estimate.  I want to maximise my performance in our raids, which in turn helps to maximise raid performance, but I get worried when my DPS on our WWS parses is lower than your theoretical estimate.  I am looking for reasons why this may occur.<br>
<br>
To summarize:<br>
1) Does your spreadsheet account for the use of feint?<br>
2) If not, should our practical DPS in a raid be less than your estimate?<br>
3) Does my tank need greater threat generation?<br>
4) Is the problem on my end and, if so, is there any advice for this situation?<br>
<br>
Lastly, I realize that the purpose of your spreadsheet is to compare gear and not necessarily make a DPS estimate for the whole character.  However, I am more confident in your Gear spreadsheet than the alternative DPS spreadsheet and, thus, am seeking your advice.</div>

		<div id="post_message_517500">To answer in brief:<br>
<br>
1) No<br>
2) No<br>
3) Probably<br>
4) Hard to say<br>
<br>
To answer in a bit more depth:<br>
<br>
I would expect damage to vary quite a bit from the number in the sheet in practice, as the variance on rogue DPS is fairly high.  Even if you execute the perfect cycle with the same gear every single fight, your DPS will probably vary by as much as 100 DPS either way.<br>
<br>
The sheet makes absolutely no allowance for threat reduction; I have actually considered adding that option, but I haven't felt a huge demand for it so I have not included it yet.<br>
<br>
Regarding your specific examples of sustained DPS situations: it should be noted that RoS Phase 1 has 0 armor and, as such, tends to generate much larger DPS numbers than you get elsewhere.  And my concerns with the other two examples is that you're dealing with combat segments less than one minute long, which colors your DPS number.  Even neglecting cooldowns for the moment (and I, for one, tend to blow AR, Blade Flurry, Haste Pots, Heroism, etc. during non-aggro-limited sections of fights), the simple fact that you start with 100 energy increases your DPS by a good 50 or so; plus, the variance on such short sections of combat is even higher.  I've seen rogues average 20% crit on Akama one week and 50% the next week without changing any gear or buffs.<br>
<br>
So, the benchmarking fights I'd use are things like Tidewalker (if you can get an un-graved attempt), Teron Gorefiend, or (depending on your strategy), Azgalor; with a good tank, these should not be threat-limited enough that you need to feint - vanish should be plenty, and even that may not be necessary depending on your tank.  If you are having serious aggro issues on these fights, your tank is probably not generating as much aggro as is possible, either due to lacking proper aggro-generation itemization (hit, expertise, shield block, etc.), not mashing hard enough, or not using the correct aggro cycle.  For reference: most of the rogues in my guild don't even have feint on their bars.<br>
<br>
Regarding specific DPS comparisons to the sheet: make sure your buffs and the bosses armor are entered correctly; for instance, the "Number of Heroisms" parameter is number per 10 minutes, so if you get one in a 3 min fight like Akama, you may want to enter 3 instead of 1.  But, you should also remember that there's a lot of variance in this.  Personally, I've found it to be fairly accurate for me, but if you're finding it inaccurate, I would look through a WWS or two and figure out where the disagreement is between theory and practice.</div>

<br>
Teron Gorefiend is one of the fights that I also have threat issues with.  Typically our melee group does not use any cooldowns until about 70% and our shaman twists Windfury and Tranquil Air to help us keep threat low until that point.  Still, I generally have to throw a feint into roughly every other cycle; after cooldowns are blown at 70% I'll drop my vanish and threat really isn't an issue after that.<br>
<br>
So, I suspect that the problem mostly lies in my tank's threat generation.  We no longer step foot into Serpentshrine and our strat for Azgalor has melee running out of combat when hit by a rain of fire.  Buff differences between the sheet and what actually occurs in my raid is probably the next major culprit in my discrepancy and I'll look into that more deeply -- thanks again.</div>

</div>I'm pretty sure that Salvation and Tranquil Air actually DO stack, meaning you end up generating 56% of your normal, unbuffed threat.<br>
<br>
Regardless, nelalas if you're aggro capping on Teron then your tank has some serious threat issues (or if you don't have Salv then your raid leaders have some serious group composition issues).</div>

</div>I have Rod of the Sun King since it dropped on our first Kael kill and at that time I was daggers and went for it since the other rogues did not want it. <br>
<br>
Since then we only had one talon and lots of blade of infamy but I never wanted to change infamy for the rod. <br>
After the ssc/tk weapon buff its very close when it comes to swords and I am always on top with the other rogue who is swords.<br>
<br>
As regarding the proc I would say its 2-3ppm and this is not a conclusion after testing that I did but I watch randomly during boss fights. Then again I might be missing the sword spec from the MH but as regarding dps and ppm I would say that the Rod is very good.<br>
Since yesterday I got the savagery blade from mother and I will run some more tests with the Rod and post my findings.</div>

I didn't bother to include the non-sword PvP MHs, as I have a hard time seeing why one would pick one up as they're inferior to the MH Swords.<br>

</div>Looking at this data set: we have 3894 melee attacks; typically about 1/3 of those are MH attacks.  Thus, we have something like 1300 MH white hits.  If it were a 1 PPM effect as postulated, we would expect 1300 MH hits to generate roughly 40 procs.<br>
<br>
Additionally, we have 934 Sinister Strikes; assuming 1 PPM, we would expect to see about 40 procs from this as well.<br>
<br>
Finally, we have 65 kicks and eviscerates, which I believe can proc, which would make for a couple more procs.<br>
<br>
Thus, if it were a 1 PPM effect as postulated, we'd expect to see about 85 procs.  In reality, there were 104.  So while it might be a bit over 1 PPM, it's certainly a lot less than 2.<br>

<br>
After inputting my spec into your spreadsheet, I find myself puzzled looking at my current hit vs. the optimal hit.  I have a mix of T4/T5 gear, and other than my OH (which I took a beating on the other day, and now swapped for something else) I consider my gear to be outstanding considering we are not beyond SSC/TK right now.<br>
<br>
So my current hit is 242... your sheet calculates 206.  Have I put too much emphasis on AGI which is at 610 unbuffed, or am I thinking too hard about HIT for the time being?<br>
<br>
Check my armory and tell me what you think, or can you point me to a discussion on the relationship between AGI, HIT, and Crit... <br>
<br>
Thanks</div>

		<div id="post_message_518922">Rogar, from what it sounds like the sheet is actually reccomending you socket away from hit rating and put in, I would assume, agi gems.  This seems a little odd to be because the value of hit rating seems to dramatically increase when you have powerful procs like DST, part of this might be the DST nerf or it could also be an odd selection of buffs.  One other thought about the seemingly low value of hit for you is that hit will increase in value if you have two epic weapons, so if you plugged your gear in with the s2 OH and then compared to the blue your armory shows, or latro's even Hit will be better with better weapons.<br>
<br>
Agi, Hit and Crit will never break down into a x Agi = y Hit, because they change in effectiveness depending on your buffs and gear, for example if you check/uncheck the kings buff the value of agi changes greatly.  Also various procs increase the value of different stats, take your Tsunami Talisman having that equiped will make crit and also agi more valuable.<br>
<br>
Ultimatly the answer is that it depends, because gear will not have the same amounts of stats on them, so while hit might be more valuable point for point than agi if something has twice the agi it will be better.</div>

Just curious if you were coming out with a new version of the sheet with the new Arena swords any time soon?  I am debating whether to bother with season 3 sword (b/c I'd frankly rather blow my accumulated points on new armor and a new main hand mace (assuming they don't buff BT/Hyjal weapons, which they really need to go ahead and do already ).</div>

As the sheet doesnt have a spot for the Revenger, I changed the data for the Latros... so your thought about 2 epic weapons could still be part of the equation.  As a test though, I created a spreadsheet from a guild mate that has the S2 Swords, and even took the time to input all of his gear, gems, and enchants... 206 ends up being his optimal hit, way lower than I had ever believed made sense.<br>

I have a mix of T4/T5 gear, and other than my OH (which I took a beating on the other day, and now swapped for something else) I consider my gear to be outstanding considering we are not beyond SSC/TK right now.<br>
<br>
So my current hit is 242... your sheet calculates 206.  Have I put too much emphasis on AGI which is at 610 unbuffed, or am I thinking too hard about HIT for the time being?<br>
<br>
Check my armory and tell me what you think, or can you point me to a discussion on the relationship between AGI, HIT, and Crit...</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>Having looked at your gear and played with the spreadsheet a bit, I think it fundamentally comes down to your OH Weapon.<br>
<br>
1) Revenger is a vastly lower-DPS weapon than Talon of Azshara; hence, the overall value of white damage is lower relative to the overall value of yellow damage (as all yellow attacks are performed with a 95 DPS sword, and 40% of white damage is coming from a 70 DPS sword).  Since yellow damage benefits not at all from hit, this lowers the value of hit to some extent.<br>
<br>
2) A major contribution of hit is that it allows your procs to proc more often.  Hence, the more procs you have, the better hit is; and, conversely, the fewer procs you have, the less valuable hit it.  In your case, as you have 20 agi rather than mongoose on the OH, you have one fewer proc than a lot of rogues and, as such, the value of hit is also depressed.<br>
<br>
In case you were wondering why 1) doesn't apply as strongly to Latro's, the answer is that it's mitigated by 2) as it related to Combat Potency.<br>

</div>Thanks.  At the risk of turning this into a "grats on loot" thread, I suppose I should also commend you on your recent acquisition of the OH Warglaive.  Hopefully the MH won't turn out like Death's Sting did for you back in the day.<br>

</div>Well, my to-do list for next release is back up to 15 items or so, meaning it's going to take a bit of time to work everything out.  I would expect it to take a couple weeks to sort out everything, particularly since there's still some mechanics on PTR that need to be divined (to wit: what are the base miss/dodge rates of bosses?  And is there any truth to the rumor that the Warglaive set bonus now has a hidden cooldown?).  As such, I wouldn't expect anything before the end of the month, and it could easily take longer (particularly since I've started work on some other projects).<br>
<br>
In the meantime, I would refer you to the assortment of posts made regarding the value of MH weapons over the last few pages, which, stated briefly, imply that the Season 3 Slicer is better than everything except Warglaive, but that it doesn't beat Talon or Infamy by very much.  So if you don't have anything else to spend points on, it's a perfectly valid place to dump them; but if you're desirous of obtaining significant amounts of other PvP gear it may not be your top priority.</div>

		<div id="post_message_519668">Well, Hemo costs 35 energy, your typical cycle is 5s/5r or some close kin of that, and you have Relentless Strikes but not Combat Potency.  So, off the top of my head, that sounds like your finishers are free and you just get a Hemo every 3.5 seconds.  Now, my understanding is that that damage then gets fed through the multipliers of each person - it does double that on a crit, and, in particular, it gets mitigated by armor.  My best guess it that when you average out all those multipliers accross the tanks, hunters, rogues, etc. you wind up getting less than 36 damage out of the debuff in practice - I suspect 85% of that or so is more typical.  So each debuff adds something like 300-310 damage, or in the ballpark of 85 DPS.<br>
<br>
So, the question is: is this enough to make up the difference between Hemo and Combat?  Well, with my current gear and full raid buffs, the spreadsheet is reporting 1734 DPS for my combat swords build.  If I spec 11/27/23 Hemo and adjust my equipment to make better use of the new spec (still using items I actually have), it reports 1607 DPS.<br>
<br>
Now, with the new Dirty Deeds in 2.3, I would do 20% more than than that while the mob was sub-35%.  Now, in practice, given that everyone else does more damage at low%, one is sometimes dead by the time you get to 35%, and, if your guild is like mine, Heroism tends to get popped earlier in that fight more often than later, one probably doesn't actually do 35% of your damage to mobs that are sub-35%.  In practice, one probably only does 25-30% of one's damage in this period.  For the sake of argument, lets say 25%.  Thus, Dirty Deeds increases one damage by about 5% on the whole; hence that 1607 now becomes 1688.  Throw in the 85 DPS we estimated for the Hemo debuff, and all of a sudden this isn't looking too bad.</div>

<br>
For PvP, however, where +1 dam equals 0.1 to 0.125 additional dps, this is a apprx 3.25% dps increase.</div>

Sounds like it's probably better to go 11/28/22 with 2/2 WEx and 1/2 Dirty Deeds, which ups the base DPS to 1619, which is increased by about 1% by Dirty Deeds to 1635.  Even with the 85 from Hemo, that doesn't match combat; and, moreover, it strikes me as more circumstantial; you're getting a larger fraction of your damage from Rupture, so on unrupturable mobs you'll do significantly less; additionally, your survivability is a bit lower from the loss of Vitality, and your burst damage suffers from the lack of AR.  Plus, you're using an extra debuff slot, which, depending on your guild, may be an issue.<br>
<br>
On the whole, it sounds like Hemo is closer to combat, but I'm not seeing a fundamental reason to bring a hemo rogue over a combat rogue from a DPS perspective.</div>

</div>Same here, yeah.  It's a step in the right direction, but not enough to tip the scales (or even to balance the scales...).  If Opp went to 2/2 or 3/3, it'd let CD rogues pick up Murder/etc.  But I think the true "fix" to balance daggers again would be to do something interesting with dagger spec, in addition to the 5% crit.</div>

This is a nerf PvE-wise, as it is reduced from 30 to 10 charges, which are going to be eaten up extremely fast in a normal 25-man pvp raid, that the hemo-buff will be basically non-existing in PvE. Alone a hunter can take 3-5 charges per second. So for PvE it is now not only useless, but practically non present, hence a nerf of aprx 6-7% DpS vs. current Hemo situation in PvE. <br>

</div>Not really.. Yes they nerfed it from 30 charges to a third of that.. but they also MORE than tripled the dmg per charge.  Instead of 30 * 10 extra damage, you now get 10 * 36.  Also, 10 charges are virtually GAURENTEED to be all eaten up in 3.5 seconds - 30 charges weren't always.<br>
<br>
So.. you are now more likely to be able to use all of the charges, and you gain more damage per hemo than before.</div>

</div>I don't see that that's particularly necessary, and, more to the point, I don't think Blizzard is going to implement daggers faster than 1.3 anytime soon.  Besides which, that's not really the problem.<br>
<br>
The problem, particularly after these new changes is not that dagger spec is too weak; it's that sword spec is too good.  With my current armor and Arena 2 Daggers, with the Aggression change, the spreadsheet estimates 1651 DPS (buffed).  Switching to combat fists (that is, fist/fist spec, not fist/sword hybrid), I show 1682 DPS... against Murderable targets.  Against non-Murderable targets, that goes down to 1639 DPS.  Given that fully half of BT and all of Hyjal is not Murderable, that's really not too bad a tradeoff - 2% less damage against Murderable targets, 1% more vs non-Murderable targets.  So I would argue that with the new changes, combat daggers is reasonably well-matched in terms of sustained DPS relative to Combat Fists (and hence Combat Maces).  The problem is that Combat Swords is just plain better, due to the power of OH sword spec.<br>
<br>
Now, this still leaves the problem that Combat Daggers cycles suck; what I would like to see to fix this is a new rank of slice and dice with a 3 second longer duration.  This would allow combat daggers to use the far more efficient 1s3r cycle without needing to resort to T4 2/5.  It would also increase rogue DPS a bit, to compsate for the overall loss DPS we'd suffer from having Sword Spec nerfed.<br>
<br>
Hence, my proposal for bringing the specs closer to balance is:<br>
<br>
1) Have OH Sword Spec proc OH hits instead of MH.  This would bring Sword Spec into balance with the other specs.<br>
2) Add SnD Rank 3, with base duration 12/15/18/21/24 seconds.  This would allow Dagger rogues to use a more efficient, less disruptable cycle.<br>
<br>
This would, coincidentally, also give Hemo rogues a better cycle (as currently they can't quite sustain 5s5r) - they could use 4s5r, which would also make them a slightly more stable spec for raiding.<br>
<br>
On the whole, it seems to me that this would address many of the current issues with spec balance.  I'm sure there are other ways of doing so, but this seems like the simplest way to me.<br>
<br>
<b>Edit:</b><br>
The alternative to #2 would be to bump Imp SnD up to 20/40/60%, which would have approximately the same effect overall; it would mean daggers would end up using a cycle more like 3s/3r, but that's acceptable.</div>

		<div id="post_message_520209">My thoughts on the combat daggers is that the one change which would benefit the specc more is to have opp lowered to 3 ranks with same effects. CD are much more affected by lethality than any other specc (35% more than swords) and so 3/3 ruthlessness + 5/5 lethality coupled with the extra 6% of new aggression will put CD back to the top with swords. <br>
<br>
Adrianna: is it possible to run the numbers again on your spreadsheet with the above change (opp 3 talents and thus full ruthlessness + lethality)?<br>
<br>
Thanks in advance<br>
<br>

<br>
p.s. Also the release of a 1.2-1.3 OH dagger with the stats/dps of Tracker's for example would improve end combat dagger rogues' dps ...</div>

</div>I fully agree with your analysis, my purpose was helping the spec via items instead of modifing talents.<br>
As you said in a previous post, pre-bc combat dagger were competitive with swords due to the lack of MH sword between Fankriss / Rank 14 and Kel'Thuzad.<br>
<br>
Since <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=29275"><span><span class="purplename">[Searing Sunblade]</span></span></a>, there is no longer 1.3 dagger, and this could help combat dagger spec.</div>

		<div id="post_message_520259"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Personally, my idea for fixing combat daggers would take a completely difference approach. I personally feel that the three principal problems for combat daggers are:<br>
<br>
- 5/5 Opportunity essentially required, forcing points out of Assassination, preventing full Ruthlessness, full Lethality, and Murder<br>
- Backstab cost prevents better cycles from being used<br>
- Dagger spec, like fist spec, does not scale fully with stats; it scales with AP, but not crit rate or hit rate<br>
<br>
I believe the first two issues could be addressed by two changes: add an energy reduction to Backstab to some talent in either Assassination or Combat, and push Opportunity back down to the second tier of Subtlety. In order to make up for the loss of 20% damage on Backstabs, its energy cost would need to be reduced by 10, to 50 -- this would increase Backstab DPE by 20%, basically the same effect as Opportunity, but achieved in a different manner.<br>
<br>
Backstab DPE is already sufficiently high, but the 60 energy cost penalizes it too much relative to Sinister Strike. As a result, you lose more from your cycle than you're gaining from your Backstabs. Without doing a lot of analysis right now to support this, I feel like a 50-energy Backstab would reduce a great deal of the cycle burden on dagger builds. In addition, requiring only Assassination and Combat talents for a dagger build would mean a 19/42/0 build for daggers, such as this:<br>
<br>
<a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?talent=f0efoxZ0eV0bEz0MGRt" target="_blank">Talent Calculator - World of Warcraft</a><br>
<br>
In this build, imagine that Dagger Specialization provides both 1% crit and 2 energy off Backstab per talent point. This build would be able to compete quite evenly with combat swords, thanks to a better cycle, full Ruthlessness, full Lethality, and Murder.<br>
<br>
As far as fist and dagger specs are concerned, I'm not sure exactly how Blizzard can fix those. Extra attacks are an extremely powerful mechanic. One thing I know would scale with all stats, though, would be haste; changing one or both weapon specs to 1% haste per talent point would bring them into almost direct competition with swords. It would probably have to be fists, though, because dagger's superior DPE would have it surpassing swords by leaps and bounds if it had a 5% haste weapon spec.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I'll stop this rambling right now, as this post is pretty much against the cardinal rules of the forum, blindly theorycrafting without doing any math. Still, I think I'm making fairly educated guesses. I like Aldriana's suggestions too, but I would rather see dagger builds freed from the burdens of the 5/5 Opportunity requirement and the 60 energy cost of Backstab.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I'm not asking for it.  I'm just saying it's the best way to solve the current issue.  If you don't mind the fact that every single rogue wants to be swords and all other weapon types might as well just be sharded as soon as they drop, then there is no problem right now.  However, I think we would benefit more by having a couple of specs using different weapon types, thereby allowing all rogues in a raid to get weapons in a timely fashion since they're not all going for the same thing.  And if you look at the changes I proposed, there are both buffs and nerfs, which would on the net put us about where we are on DPS.<br>
<br>
My objection to solving the problem by buffing daggers is that it doesn't really strike at the core of the problem; as I've discussed before, the problem with Sword Spec is not scaling, it's that the benefit is assymetrically loaded on the two hands.  You can't buff the other specs to match; all that's going to do is make hybrid XXX/sword specs tops.  The problem that really needs to be solved is that every single rogue in existance wants to use a sword OH, which, coupled with the fact that there are very very few good OH swords from PvE, has led to the current situation where we're incredibly reliant on PvP weapons in order to itemize effectively.<br>
<br>
This is, similarly, my objection to the proposal of changing one of the other weapon effects to haste; while it would buff the spec, you'd still want to use a sword OH to get those procs, leading to a situation where fist/sword (or whatever) is clearly superior to all other specs.  Fundamentally, the only possible specializations that are going to perform in a way that solves the OH-sword problem is proc-based ones; so a haste (or crit, or armor pen, or whatever) *proc* specialzation would be a better solution.<br>
<br>
Really, though, this all becomes quite complicated and messy; the elegant solution is to simply nerf sword spec a bit, and then buff rogues through other means so that our DPS winds up in the same place with each of 4 or 5 different specs, rather than all of us winding up with one.  That's all I'm proposing; at no time have I advocated that our damage should be reduced.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_520303"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->We'll agree to disagree. You are basically saying, "fix this by making sword spec worse... oh, by the way, while you are doing this please remember to buff all rogues."<br>
<br>
My real fear is Blizzard reading the first half and not the second. And for that matter, I hardly see sword-spec rogues out of proportion on raid dps given the age-old, completely accurate fact that we bring nothing else besides our damage ouptut on single targets.<br>
<br>
And quite frankly, I find your argument convoluted at best. The problem is that no matter what people will want to offhand a sword? How about a fix such that you can't logically take sword spec + mace or dagger or fist spec? You know, make something else worthwhile in the talent tree? How about you can only get procs from one spec period at a given time (e.g. your mainhand weapon determines the type of procs you get)? Then you'd only pick one spec and rogues could spend those points on other talents?<br>
<br>
You don't have to take away OH sword procs from sword rogues, you can simply take away OH sword procs from people not mainhanding a sword. Fixed. Now sword rogues don't have lose dps to fix what is current, imo, a non-problem as I know plenty of dagger rogues who are not quitting WoW just cause they don't have the highest dps build/spec. Not everyone min/maxes like the people you know, I guess. We have a mace-spec rogue who simply chooses not to respec weekly for the arena. <br>
<br>
In fact, if you take all 4 of the talents and compress them into 1 spot on the talent tree, each of which operates different, you'd end hybrid / dual spec-ing. And really, while I'm sure that spec-ing exists, I find the notion this a "problem" with sword spc to be completely absurd.<br>
<br>
While you think it's logical, that's perfectly fine, you're entitled to you opinion. In the meantime, I'm going to say it again: Sword rogues don't need a nerf. Fix whatever parity problem exists elsewhere.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I fully agree with your analysis, my purpose was helping the spec via items instead of modifing talents.<br>
As you said in a previous post, pre-bc combat dagger were competitive with swords due to the lack of MH sword between Fankriss / Rank 14 and Kel'Thuzad.<br>
<br>
Since <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=29275" target="_blank">[Searing Sunblade]</a>, there is no longer 1.3 dagger, and this could help combat dagger spec.</div>

	</tbody></table>
</div>To expand on this, I'd honestly like to know why we have swords and other weapons with 1.4 speed while many dagger offhands are 1.5.  Daggers are supposed to be the faster weapons, so I'd actually like a change to all itemization to reflect this.<br>
<br>
Dagger offhands -&gt; 1.1 speed (1.1/1.8 = 0.61)<br>
Swords/maces/fists -&gt; 1.6 speed (1.6/2.6 = 0.61)<br>
<br>
Then we'd actually have a similar ratio for weapon speeds based on the hand used.  Another benefit is this would also level out the specs somewhat.  Fists and maces could opt to use a dagger offhand for a decrease in damage from their specific spec while getting a boost in yellow damage, but swords would probably not see a gain due to the nature of offhand sword spec procs.<br>
<br>
With normal basic slice and dice, for example:<br>
1.6 hasted to 1.23, average 1 CP proc per 6.15 seconds - 15 / 61.5 ~ 24% extra energy<br>
1.1 hasted to 0.85, average 1 CP proc per 4.25 seconds - 15 / 42.5 ~ 35% extra energy<br>
<br>
Roughly a 10% yellow damage gain, so rougly a 3.5-4% overall gain.  I believe that's about the advantage sword spec has currently, yes?<br>
<br>
If this were paired with a change to a 3-point opportunity, I think the specs would finally be pretty balanced.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_520338"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I don't think it's precisely fair to say that "most" daggers are 1.5 speed.  There's, what, 2 of them?  Tracker's Blade and Retainer's Blade?  There's 2 1.5 speed daggers, 2 1.3 speed daggers, and the rest (Messenger of Fate, Dirge, Feltooth Eviscerator, the PvP daggers...) are 1.4 speed; hence, "most" daggers are 1.4 speed, while "most" swords are 1.5 speed (with three exceptions which are 1.4, and the Blacksmithing Swords which are 1.6).  So the average dagger is faster than the average sword.<br>
<br>
Now, that said, it is true that they could make the difference larger, and that would certainly help; I'm not saying that I'd complain if they made some fixes via itemization.  I just think this is somewhat unlikely since historically Blizzard has preferred to fix the underlying mechanics of the class and leave itemization alone, presumably because changing the itemization can have unintended consequences for other classes, while fixing the class itself cuts to the heart of the issue; item fixes are usually only done when it's a blanket problem across the board for all classes (as was true for both the Haste buff and the Haste nerf).  So, without making any value judgements on which would work better in this case, I think it is more likely that they'll change the rogue mechanics rather than changing the items.<br>
<br>
On the whole, I think this is a case of Blizzard not fully understanding how large the speed effect was at first; Instant attack normalization was introduced because speed on MH weapons was too important, but OH Weapon Speed matters more than MH Weapon speed ever did now.  So my theory as to what happened is that they made a few fast weapons without fully appreciating how much of a difference it makes, and thus had to keep making fast weapons to allow the new itemization to remain competitive; hence, another change I might expect to see is Combat Potency changed to scale with weapon speed. If it granted, say, 10xWeaponSpeed instead of a flat 15 energy, it would reduce the massive influence of OH weapon speed to a more managable level.  This would, unfortuantely, nerf combat daggers relative to it's current strength, and it can't really afford the hit, which is perhaps one of the reasons it hasn't happened yet.<br>
<br>
Of course, for that matter, one could argue that Combat Daggers was a spec that Blizzard hadn't anticipated in the first place; looking at the trees, it seems to me that the original intent was that combat would get more use for SS builds, whereas dagger builds would tend to invest more deeply in assassination.  Whether this is true or not, Blizzard has certainly made changes to accomodate it's existance (Opportunity being moved down a tier from it's original position, and the new Aggression change, among other things), but I am forced to wonder if Blizzard would actually mind if Combat Daggers faded away to be replaced with SF Hybrid and Mutilate builds.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">If you don't mind the fact that every single rogue wants to be swords and all other weapon types might as well just be sharded as soon as they drop, then there is no problem right now.  However, I think we would benefit more by having a couple of specs using different weapon types, thereby allowing all rogues in a raid to get weapons in a timely fashion since they're not all going for the same thing.  And if you look at the changes I proposed, there are both buffs and nerfs, which would on the net put us about where we are on DPS.</div>

</div>I agree with you that it would be nice if all the specs were mathmatically even.  However, you are overstating things just a bit :P  The fury warrior in our raid was quite happy when the MH Fist off of Al'ar dropped.  Also, there are still plenty of rogues running around with felsteel longblades, many of which aren't on RP servers (which is the only reason I could think of having one that's not pure stupidity). Finally, you've stated before that a rogues DPS can vary widely even on the same fight with the same gear.  So other than the people that have really tried to put the time into the math, or taken advantage of other's work (thank you), most people will probably never put together a data set large enough to show that, say, swords is significantly different than daggers in DPS.<br>

</div>Overall, I think the idea of messing with daggers and making them 1.1 speed would influence things besides CP procs.  I can't remember the formula at the moment, but a shiv would be about 30 energy at that point?  I can imagine weird things with Arena's and rogues running around shiving instant poison for the CP stacks.<br>

</div>10xweapon speed is an interesting idea, I suppose that faster would still be better for poisons and shiving, but the change would make all the sword spec weaponsmiths happy I'm sure.  <br>
<br>
I wonder if part of the idea behind mutilate was to make that the new daggers build.<br>
<br>
Not to get too RP or anything but I think that it is true that people have very different visions of what a rogue is when they roll one.  I for one was thinking of a blademaster/fencing/swashbuckler type so I've always been happy with being swords.  My main wish was that we got some of the graphics that caster blades got, the prime example being the lightsabre looking weapon.  I've also read a post by someone that was playing an orc rogue that thought of his rogue as a thug and leveled maces.  Finally, I'm sure that many people think of rogues as dagger in the back, thief sort of character.  I happen to think of all of these a reason-able views of a rogue.  To some extent that fact that combat daggers is no longer THE dagger spec actually helps identify combat rogues as more of the upfront fighter/blade dancer type and leaves the assassination and shadow step build to be the dagger in the back trees.  In fact, given the current itemization (a pretty even mix of Maces, fists, daggers and swords) I would be quite upset if the only/best choice of weapon for all three trees was a dagger.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">1) Have OH Sword Spec proc OH hits instead of MH.  This would bring Sword Spec into balance with the other specs.<br>
2) Add SnD Rank 3, with base duration 12/15/18/21/24 seconds.  This would allow Dagger rogues to use a more efficient, less disruptable cycle.<br>
<br>
This would, coincidentally, also give Hemo rogues a better cycle (as currently they can't quite sustain 5s5r) - they could use 4s5r, which would also make them a slightly more stable spec for raiding.<br>
<br>
On the whole, it seems to me that this would address many of the current issues with spec balance.  I'm sure there are other ways of doing so, but this seems like the simplest way to me.<br>
<br>
<b>Edit:</b><br>
The alternative to #2 would be to bump Imp SnD up to 20/40/60%, which would have approximately the same effect overall; it would mean daggers would end up using a cycle more like 3s/3r, but that's acceptable.</div>

</div>It's true, some weapons can also be used by other classes, particularly fists and maces.  However, daggers seem to be primarily the province of rogues; they're too fast for shaman and fury warriors can only use them in the OH (and rarely do even there) because they're normalized at a faster speed than other weapons, thus gimping their instant attacks.  Rogues are really the only class that makes good use of daggers.  Consider:<br>
<br>
In Black Temple, there are 3 swords and 2 daggers<br>
In Hyjal, there is 1 sword and 2 daggers<br>
In SSC/TK, there is 1 sword and 2 daggers<br>
In Karazhan, there is 1 sword and 3 daggers<br>
In ZA, there are 2 swords and 3 daggers<br>
<br>
In every instance other than BT, there are twice as many dagger drops as sword drops - and even in BT, given that 2 of those swords are legendary drops off Illidan, the daggers are probably easier to come by.  How much more quickly could we upgrade our weapons if we could make use of all those daggers?  <br>
<br>
Regarding your point: it's true that not everyone is an avid theorycrafter.  Yet, in my experience, it's still true that they know some of these things.  The other rogues in my guild are utterly disdainful of spreadsheets, and yet, lets look at what weapons they're using:<br>
<br>
1) Warglaive/MG Quickblade<br>
2) Infamy/Savagery<br>
3) Infamy/Savagery<br>
4) Infamy/G Quickblade (recently having respecced from daggers with Shard of Azzinoth/Messenger of Fate)<br>
5) ToA/MG Quickblade (&lt;--me)<br>
<br>
For all their disdain of spreadsheets, they've universally decided to use swords over daggers.  So, clearly, they've realized something of the difference.<br>

</div>So, there's been a couple different proposals to free up a couple talent points for a rogue to allow us to get 5/5 Lethality, 3/3 Ruthlessness, and all the benefits from Imp Backstab and Opportunity.  Plugging this into the spreadsheet, I come up with a DPS number of 1670 (as compared to fists which were 1639/1682... and swords, which are 1662/1705.  So this would put daggers ahead of fists, but still behind swords for most purposes.  And, as discussed, buffing fist spec directly doesn't quite work, at that just leads to the dominance of fist/sword hybrid builds.<br>
<br>
So, while that would work for bringing daggers closer to swords, 1) it's not enough, 2) it doesn't solve the issue that all SS/Hemo rogues want an OH sword, and 3) It still leaves daggers with a rather miserably long cycle.  So it's certainly a partial fix, but I don't think it's a total one.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Having successfully played combat daggers for a while now, in a guild dominated by sword rogues, I can think of a few small fixes that would work wonders for combat daggers.<br>
<br>
First, adding 40-50 armor penetration to each rank of Opportunity would provide a healthy damage increase that wouldn't really do anything to swords.  Sword builds can't squeeze that in, even Mutilate wouldn't take it; it's exclusively a combat dagger talent (in a raiding context) and so buffing it would all but guarantee its benefits would remain restricted to a single spec.<br>
<br>
Secondly, adding another component to Dagger Specialization (as was previously discussed) is a good idea.  A combat dagger rogue really can't squeeze sword spec into a build, so there's no fear of dual-speccing.  I wouldn't mind seeing some armor penetration on this talent also, or maybe even some expertise.  Dodged Backstabs are the bane of any combat dagger rogue, because they completely dismantle the combat rotations we use.  Fewer dodged Backstabs adds even more energy efficiency to a build already known for it, and allows it to improve upon its core advantage.<br>
<br>
Thirdly, a buff to Improved Backstab that incorporates a reduced energy cost component would be incredible.  Enough has been said about this already, so I won't elaborate.<br>
<br>
With regard to fists, I don't really know what can be done to fix it.  I do think that all specializations should be retooled such that the bonuses they provide only take effect if the rogue wields two weapons of the same type as their specialization.<br>
<br>
On a side note, I originally tried rationalizing that Blizzard hadn't given up on combat daggers because the Combat Potency graphic was a dagger.  I soon abandoned this belief, however, when I realized that the graphic for Sinister Strike is also a dagger :/<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">So, there's been a couple different proposals to free up a couple talent points for a rogue to allow us to get 5/5 Lethality, 3/3 Ruthlessness, and all the benefits from Imp Backstab and Opportunity.  Plugging this into the spreadsheet, I come up with a DPS number of 1670 (as compared to fists which were 1639/1682... and swords, which are 1662/1705.  So this would put daggers ahead of fists, but still behind swords for most purposes.  And, as discussed, buffing fist spec directly doesn't quite work, at that just leads to the dominance of fist/sword hybrid builds.<br>
<br>
So, while that would work for bringing daggers closer to swords, 1) it's not enough, 2) it doesn't solve the issue that all SS/Hemo rogues want an OH sword, and 3) It still leaves daggers with a rather miserably long cycle.  So it's certainly a partial fix, but I don't think it's a total one.</div>

Combat potency is also in need of a change, since it makes upgrades very confusing for the rogues who doesn't know exactly how it works(warp-splinter &gt; retainers, latros &gt; bs offhand sword). Exactly what they fixed with normalization so that Shanker wasn't better then several other supposedly clear upgrades.

		<div id="post_message_521156"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I'm sorry but I completely disagree with nerfing any rogue spec's dps.  If you nerf Sword rogues, you are just making it so Fury warriors are equal or back on top again.  This is something I am 100% against.<br>
<br>
No to fix the problem, you need to buff dagger rogues and not abilities that influence swords.<br>
<br>
In addition you have to be careful as to not just buff combat daggers because the gap between them and mutilate rogues is already large enough.<br>
<br>
Buff daggers in general so that it positively impacts both Mutilate and Combat Daggers.  And they need to not forget about Subtlety rogues who are already leaps and bounds behind warriors, shamans, and druids in terms of single target dps.<br>
<br>
My ideas are:<br>
1)  Change dagger normalization from 1.7 to 1.8.  This is about a small but easily manageable upgrade.<br>
2)  Reduce the penalty on Mutilate when mobs arent poisoned and buff the base dmg.  Currently its 100% dmg + 50% more against poisoned targets.  Change it to 125% dmg + 25% against poisoned targets.  Same max dmg, but smaller gap.  You don't want to really increase the max dmg of Mutilate because it might overbalance things in PvP.<br>
3)  Change Hemo to be based off AP, not wpn dmg.  That way it scales just as well with dagger rogues as it does sword rogues.<br>
4)  Reduce Opportunity to be 2 ranks instead of 5 with the same max value.  10% per rank.<br>
5)  Reduce Lethality to be 3 ranks instead of 5 with the same max value.  10% per rank.<br>
(Sword rogues already can easily get 5/5 Lethality but CD rogues cant.  This would allow them to max Opp and Lethality without losing Ruth/Relent).<br>
<br>
I am against moving Opp to the Combat or Assasination tree because it is a major part of Subtlety builds.<br>
<br>
Edit:  Changing the normalization, whether its 1.7 to 1.8 or even 1.9 would help with the scaling problems of BS vs SS and would have a small enough impact so you wouldnt have to worry about overpowering one build over another.<br>
<br>
End goal is to make this the order of best dps specs:<br>
1)  Combat Daggers<br>
2)  Combat Swords/Fists/Maces = Mutilate<br>
3)  Subtlety<br>
<br>
The difference between CD and CS should be small, like 2%.  Mutilate should be within 5%.  Subtlety should be within 10%.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_521197"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->To be perfectly honest, sword specialization needs to be fixed.  With offhand procs causing main hand swings, Blizzard has created a great imbalance.  This is the biggest problem with it.  The gains by having a very fast weapon to proc Combat Potency is one thing, but swords gets to double-dip since the fast off-hand gets to also proc the majority of main hand swings.  With say a 1.5 speed offhand and a 2.5 speed main hand  62.5% of your sword spec procs are coming from the offhand.  This is the main reason why Latro's, being a relatively crappy weapon dps-wise, in combination with anything decent, rates as good as two decent daggers.<br>
<br>
As long as you have crazy interactions where offhands are proccing main hands outside of the energy generation cycle, you will never be able to properly balance the specs.  Maces and fists, using roughly the same combat techniques, will never be able to catch up as long as this inequity remains.  Sword spec needs to be fixed to balance things.  It's also not like combat daggers doesn't beat fury warriors already.<br>
<br>
The class I'm more worried about are hunters who seem to get buffs every patch and adding pet dps to their own are almost up there in dps.  They get that being able to stay at ranged, with mail armor, with a pet to keep mobs off them and able to deaggro with great frequency.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>The problem with moving forward with sword spec as it is is that there is simply no way to bring other specs up to par without somehow invalidating the offhand penalty for them too. I sincerely doubt that the current situation with sword spec is intended, and in my opinion even if there weren't rogues suggesting it as a course of action, we would still be seeing them nerf offhand sword spec sometime in the near future.<br>
<br>
The best fix I can think of that will bring all rogue specs on par with one another would be to make Dual Wield Specialization reduce the offhand penalty to nothing and then to change offhand sword spec to only proc offhand attacks. This way, offhand sword spec doesn't scale so wildly out of control, but at the same time, doesn't lose huge amounts of damage and fall behind other specs.<br>
<br>
Of course, removing the 25% offhand penalty would be a pretty significant damage boost for all rogue specs (for my current gear, it would be a boost of ~107 DPS). For sword rogues, however, this would be tempered by the change to offhand sword spec; for */sword hybrid rogues, it would also be tempered by the loss of offhand sword spec; and for other single-spec rogues, it would be tempered by the fact that they are already lagging behind the top DPS spec. Perhaps I'm being short-sighted, but I don't necessarily see these things as being out of control.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_521380"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->It seems that, aside for Hemo and Ghostly Strike, subtlety wants to be a dagger tree primarily (Opportunity, Imp Ambush, pre 2.3 Shadowstep), but it's defining skill (Hemo) is exclusively effective with very, very slow MH.  Given the normalized nature of Hemo and it's set energy cost, would changing it to a variable energy cost (similar to shiv, but with perhaps a lower energy cost) make it a viable for use with daggers?  You'd still end up with a higher damage per energy from a slow weapon, but you'd gain combo points at a higher rate with a fast weapon.  By changing it to a variable energy cost you'd lose damage/energy with slow weapons so I'm propose chanigng the attack to 125% weapon damage.<br>
<br>
If you set the energy cost to 15 + 10 * weapon speed a 2.8 attack speed will do 20% more damage per energy than a 1.8 attack speed dagger, but the dagger would accumulate 5 combo points 23% faster.  I'm not sure how it'd then compare to the damage of combat builds and mutilate, but would free the tree up for a wider variety of weapons.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>To be perfectly clear: no one here is suggesting that rogues be nerfed.  No one here wants rogues to do less damage than fury warriors.  What I (and others) are proposing is a rebalancing.  When you look at the rogue specializations and abilities, there are certain elements - like OH sword spec procs - that are more powerful than one might expect; these mechanics prove exceedingly difficult to balance around.  Thus, the proposal is not to make rogues do less damage; the proposal is to spread the damage potential currently loaded into one talent and spread it among abilities that can be taken by most raiding rogues, to level the playing field.  I fail to see the problem with suggesting a balanced set of changes with some buffs and some nerfs that will ultimately allow half a dozen different specs to realize the damage potential that currently is the sole province of sword rogues, but apparently there's quite a few people here who object to it.<br>
<br>
So, returning to my fundamental points:<br>
<br>
1) Fist spec, dagger spec, mace spec, and combat hemo builds are relatively well-balanced against each other at the moment.<br>
2) Sword spec is significantly more powerful than any of these options.<br>
3) The source of Sword Spec's power is that while it is extremely well balanced for MH attacks; for a single weapon, 5% chance of an extra attack with that weapon is very comparable to 5% crit with that weapon.  However, your OH weapon generates MH procs, which a) harnesses the speed differential of your weapons causing these procs to do almost twice as much damage as they otherwise would, and b) ignores the OH damage penalty.  Hence, while OH sword spec would be of comparable power to the other specs on the OH if each OH proc with a 1.5 speed weapon did .75 times the damage of a 1.5 speed weapon, instead it is doing the full damage of a 2.7 speed weapon, and hence 2.4 times as much damage as would reasonably be defined as balanced.<br>
<br>
Thus, the fundamental solution to the above is that sword spec it 2.5 times better on the OH than any other weapon specialization; this is why sword spec beats all other specs.  At the moment, there are two solutions proposed to resolve this:<br>
<br>
1) Cause OH sword spec to proc OH attacks, and increase Imp SnD to 20%/40%/60%<br>
<br>
or<br>
<br>
2) Make some permutation of changes to talent specs that allow daggers rogues to get full Ruthlessness and Lethality, and reitemize a bunch of OH daggers, and make some change that no one is quite sure about that somehow brings OH fists and maces up to spec without imbalancing MH fist/mace spec, and, oh, Hemo will probably need a buff too to keep up.  Oh, and all those changes are probably going to have some consequences for other classes and for PvP, so we'll probably need to tweak the mechanics of some other talents to keep things balanced for PvP, and...<br>
<br>
Now, I'm not going to say that option 2 doesn't work.  There probably is a way to do it... but it's certainly a heck of a lot messier.  So my question would be:<br>
<br>
If both of the above solutions yield the same endpoint, i.e., bringing all combat specs plus hemo into rough balance without significantly decreasing rogue DPS as a whole, which is the more elegant solution and, hence, which is Blizzard more likely to do?<br>

I entered into the spreadsheet a set of pre-25man gear.  Every single item was from Karazhan or earlier; the weapons used are Arena Season 1.  The damage numbers for Combat Daggers versus Combat Fists are as follows:<br>

Combat Fists: 1391<br>
Combat Daggers: 1381<br>

So, 10 DPS different.  Then, keeping the same buffs, I replaced the Arena 1 weapons with Arena 2 weapons, and upgraded all the gear from best-in-Kara to best-in-BT.  The single best item in every slot - 4/5 T6, the works.  The damage numbers for that?<br>
<br>
Combat Fists: 1767<br>
Combat Daggers: 1757<br>
<br>
...*still* 10 DPS different.  There is no appreciable scaling difference between SS builds and BS builds.  Sword spec scales a little better since it benefits from hit and crit as well as just AP; but that's purely an artifact of Sword Spec itself, and has little to nothing to do with the fundamentals of SS builds versus BS builds.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Agreed.  I think the problem most of them have, though, is that by lowering sword spec to meet the other specs where they currently sit, you'd see BM hunters/Fury Warriors (especially after 2.3) rise above us on the dmg meter.  I am against that whole-heartedly.  At the same time though, I don't see why a rogue shouldn't be able to spec whatever he so chooses (besides deep assass) and do relatively close dmg.  Also, think of it from an RP standpoint and a logical standpoint, "Why the eff would an offhand swing proc a mh swing?"  That is an obviously messed up mechanic that has led to a disparity in the specs.<br>
<br>
But, once you fix that and maybe add in the +snd %, you'd still see most rogues (sword rogues at least) drop another 50+dps which is horrible in relation to other classes gaining dps.  Again, retooling the specs would be nice, having an almost equal chance to use any spec and still top dmg meters, the problem is, as a non sword rogue, you probably won't top the dmg meters.  <br>
<br>
oh and someone said "but that would be too imbalanced in PvP" about mutilate and raising it's base dmg.... Thank you for following Blizzard into their doomed attempts at trying to balance PvE and PvP through the talent trees.  I've never seen a more idiotic thing than trying to retool and rework specs and weapons and realizing "oh, that won't work for our already broken PvP, guess we'd better change it so PvP'ers dont cry...even if it screws over PvE'ers".    /sigh<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Weighted and Defensive give a higher value to stamina and dodge (and probably a couple other things I'm too lazy to think of right now).  The reason it suggests agi gems instead of hit when you switch to weighted is because Hit is only worth slightly more DPS than Agi is, so when the value of dodge is taken in to account agi ends up coming out on top.  That doesn't necessarely mean it's the best choice for you, it's just a suggestion :-)<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Actually I think that is a very good point.  When I read what sword specialization does in the tooltip, I do not think offhand attacks get mainhand procs.  I think that you get 5% more white attacks of each type.  The tooltip itself is misleading or the mechanic isn't working as intended.  Regardless, either the tooltip or the mechanic needs fixing.<br>
<br>
It should be noted that I take this position having recently switched to swords.  Just from soloing utility, I think it unlikely I'd switch back to daggers even for a 5% damage advantage.  The increase in soloing capability isn't even comparable.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>The Offensive setting makes the spreadsheet look only at the offensive gains, such as crit and ap from agi.  The defensive and weighted settings value agi for crit, ap, dodge and armor.  So Agi will get valued more in weighted and defensive than in offensive.  I'm not sure what values it is using for weighting, just that defensive will weight more.  Also I personally use the offensive setting and then compare the agi and stam on gear afterwards.<br>

		<!-- message -->
		<div id="post_message_521726"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->There are so many fundamental issues with these bogus straw man arguments some of you insist on making.<br>
<br>
(1) Some of us don't agree that sword rogues need a nerf. It's the damage of sword rogues -- as things stand -- that currently justify our presence in raids. We're not interested in seeing that damage reduced any more. If it's 5% more damage than dagger rogues are doing, figure out a way to improve daggers 5%.<br>
<br>
(2) Some of us don't agree that the mechanic is broken at all. It's been working this way for a long time. When the swing timer was being reset, it was safe to conclude the mechanic was broken (fixed). When the proc was proc-ing another proc it was reasonable to conclude the mechanic was broken (fixed). That the OH can proc the effect is fine. When Mongooose procs on my offhand, I get haste and 120agi, not some nerfed version of Mongoose because it's offhand.<br>
<br>
(3) Some of us don't agree that hybrid-spec use exists is a problem that requires nerfing sword spec. We've proposed alternatives to make hybrid-spec use uninteresting. So we can now simply disregard that strawman.<br>
<br>
(4) Some of us don't agree that the proposed solutions are the only ones or simple ones. In fact, if you read the above ideas, they often move horribly into the complex. "Remove the dual wield penalty" and then fix that elsewhere? Change multiple talent tiers in multiple trees? Occam's Razor need not apply. I have no interest in the second-order effects those will create and the need to nerf thiem later.<br>
<br>
And all due respect to Aldriana, the notion that those are the only two solutions and that by ruling out the second of them you have hit on the only possibly solution to this "problem" is not really easy to take seriously. You are capable of crafting so many good arguments, claiming some paired change between OH procs and Slice and Dice is the lone solution is off.<br>
<br>
(5) Some of us don't agree that many different talent specs should be about equal in their damage. Surely no one would argue that fire needs to equal frost needs to equal arcane after all this time with regard to mages. There are tradeoffs in WoW. You pick daggers, you can ambush people for insane crits. You pick swords, you get the best single-target, stand-around damage. Sorry, but this isn't broken, it just *is*.<br>
<br>
(6) Some of us see no reason to "fix" what isn't broken. We don't want a change. We don't need a change. There just isn't evidence outside of here that people are screaming and clamoring for this change. There are so many game issues and rogue issues that exceed the fact that for the moment sword rogues are ahead of dagger rogues. An itemization change could alter that calculus in a second. A fight that requires the added stuns of mace spec could alter that calculus in a second. <br>
<br>
We are asking you to acknowledging that what is now is indeed what is now. We feel that our damage is hardly so far ahead of other classes -- never mind other rogues -- that it's somehow overpowered, especially after the haste nerfs. We don't want to see yet another reduction in our dps simply because those of you wielding daggers do less damage. The fact is that fists have been the bastard child of rogue weapons forever, due to itemization as much as anything (i.e. there are and always have been few fists). Maces have their place because of extraordinary PVP benefits. For that, they might do less damage in PVE. Fine. Daggers offer tremendous unique benefits in ambush and backstab. <br>
<br>
The game is just not broken there. And the slight superiority of swords to daggers in PVE raid context is just fine, thank you. Dagger rogues can do things in PVP and 5-man that sword rogues cannot and vice versa.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Oh, and all those changes are probably going to have some consequences for other classes and for PvP, so we'll probably need to tweak the mechanics of some other talents to keep things balanced for PvP, and...</div>

</div>Not quite sure if solution #1 will shorten the gap as more attacks from OH result in more Combat Potency procs thus more energy. Have you run any tests to see what happens if you make that change with a 1.4 OH sword for example? <br>
<br>
Also on solution #2: forgive me for saying so but i think you are pushing it out of proportion. Freeing 2 talent points to enable Combat Dagger rogue to gain full Lethality / Ruthlessness is neither messy or difficult. Plus the introduction of a decent 1.3 OH dagger into the loot pool. Anything further than that IS messy but also unneeded.<br>
<br>
And to all the debaters out there: if Combat Swords had a 10-20 DPS difference (up or down) from other speccs nobody would make any discussion at this point. But the fact remains that atm it vastly surpasses that number, which forces all raiding rogues to grab a sword sooner or later.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Just because it's been working as it has doesn't mean it's working as intended. <br>
Shamans cried when windfury was fixed.<br>
Anyway if you happened to miss it, the argument was that with any other spec you don't get a offhand "spec" proccing on mainhand. <br>
Off-hand Mace does not add +5% critical damage to your main hand if your main-hand is not a Mace. <br>
Off-hand Dagger or Fist does not add +5% crit to your main hand if your main-hand is not a Dagger or a Fist.<br>
Off-hand Sword has 5% chance to proc a extra attack. For some reason it is a main-hand attack, <b>and</b> if your main-hand is not a Sword you still gain the attack on your main-hand. <br>

Surely no one would argue that fire needs to equal frost needs to equal arcane after all this time with regard to mages. There are tradeoffs in WoW.

</div>I haven't seen anyone suggesting 30/0/31 to be buffed to be raid viable, so I'm assuming you're talking about Combat Daggers. In which case I must take a range check on my comment to (3) <br>
"Wait what?"<br>
Traditional Combat Daggers (15/41/5) is pretty much the worst spec to pvp with. Have you even tried it?<br>
I mean "insane" Ambush crits? Combat Daggers doesn't go deep enough in Subtlety to pick up Imp. Ambush, nor does it have full lethality. <br>
I fail to see what you meant by that. <br>
Perhaps 20/0/41 would offer that? But then that spec has no relevancy to PvE?<br>
<br>
As for the notion that swords are picked since they offer best single-target dps? <br>
I guess it's true with TBC swords has changed from the 2nd place (while also being the best overall build) for damage dealing to the 1st place of damage dealing (as well as retaining it's best overall status) build.<br>
Combat Daggers which had the edge on the damage pre-TBC and was considered the "Best Single-Target dps build" has now lost both standings and I'd say trails far behind swords. <br>
A lot of people I know tried Combat Daggers with the start of TBC, myself included. The build even had better itemization from PvE: (Malchazeen+Searing Sunblade vs Spiteblade/Hope Ender+Latro's). But Swords beat it and most of the high-end rogues I know have pretty much converted to Swords.<br>
So I'd people chose Swords because they lacked a better dagger alternative.<br>

There just isn't evidence outside of here that people are screaming and clamoring for this change.

</div>See this is where I'd say you're wrong. <br>
WoW you see is in the end, a game of math. If you assume equal variables then you can calculate the theoretical maximum values for each spec/attribute/etc. <br>
And it's been proven over and over again that under equal conditions Combat Swords does better than Combat Daggers. That is including theoretical "skill".<br>
Which yes in the real world might not always be "equal". But that doesn't change the facts, nor does it change the math behind the facts.<br>
<br>
As for your statement that there is no evidence outside here that sword spec is too "strong". Well I match it with my own. There's no evidence to the contrary. So until someone actually does some <b>actual</b> data gathering and analyzing. <br>
Which I guess it wouldn't be that hard with the help of the Armory. <br>
Just how many percent of the high-end rogue population is using swords? <br>
Of course then you could also want to question why they use swords over other specs? <br>
But somehow, I think most of them would have the same answer: "Because swords are the best dps spec at the moment."<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">We are asking you to acknowledging that what is now is indeed what is now. We feel that our damage is hardly so far ahead of other classes -- never mind other rogues -- that it's somehow overpowered, especially after the haste nerfs. We don't want to see yet another reduction in our dps simply because those of you wielding daggers do less damage. The fact is that fists have been the bastard child of rogue weapons forever, due to itemization as much as anything (i.e. there are and always have been few fists). Maces have their place because of extraordinary PVP benefits. For that, they might do less damage in PVE. Fine. Daggers offer tremendous unique benefits in ambush and backstab.</div>

</div>Please. Do not use superlatives. <br>
Perhaps Pre-TBC Fists were rare. This is no longer the case. I can't come up with a reason why Fists should be inferior to Swords. If you can think of any reasonable ones. Feel free to share?<br>
<br>
Maces are hardly "extraordinary". They are definitely not the end-all be all PvP Spec. Sure Mace-Stuns are beneficial but I doubt most games are won because someone favored maces over swords or fists for PvP.<br>
<br>
I can't think of a single reason why a 15/41/5 rogue would use Ambush.<br>
And Backstab? Has Positional requirement, a higher energy cost and much worse sustainability (in dps cycles) in erratic environments. So I fail to see the "tremendous unique" benefits that you mention. I can see huge downsides for what essentially is a inferior spec to swords. <br>

</div>No. It's not fine. 20/41 Combat Swords out-preforms 15/41/5 in each aspect that you suggest. PVP, 5-man, 25-man. I'd add Solo-farming/question to that as well.<br>
<br>
So please, elaborate on why you believe that it is "just fine" for combat swords to be superior to combat daggers in EVERY aspect with no redeeming qualities.<br>
<br>
Because at the moment it seems to me that your rigidness and unwillingness to change from Combat Swords is clouding your judgment. Am I wrong?<br>

		<div id="post_message_521888"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Why should <u>combat</u> fists and <u>combat</u> swords differ at all? There is no change in play style. Neither offers a unique benefit to PvP or PvE. They are completely the same, until you see the difference in damage output. Personally, I think Blizzard's original plan was to have the two interchangeable, they probably thought combat maces should be that way as well.<br>
<br>
As I see it, picking between combat fist and sword spec should only be a choice of which weapons you get first, or which one look the most bad ass. Combat daggers should have very slight DPS advantage on a stationary single target fight, and combat maces should fall very slightly behind.<br>
<br>
Now, should overall rogue dps be reduced to balance this out? Of course not. A damage reduction of sword spec, added to a overall increase in rogue dps would work just fine, IMO. <br>

<br>
(1) Some of us don't agree that sword rogues need a nerf. It's the damage of sword rogues -- as things stand -- that currently justify our presence in raids. We're not interested in seeing that damage reduced any more. If it's 5% more damage than dagger rogues are doing, figure out a way to improve daggers 5%.</div>

</div>If you'd read what I actually posted, you'd have seen that I was not advocating reducing sword rogue DPS in any way shape or form.  I was advocating reducing sword rogue DPS by 5%, and then increasing *all* rogue DPS, sword and otherwise, by 5%, thus resulting in sword rogues doing *exactly* the same amount of DPS they are doing now, but allowing all the other specs to also do as much.<br>

				(2) Some of us don't agree that the mechanic is broken at all. It's been working this way for a long time. When the swing timer was being reset, it was safe to conclude the mechanic was broken (fixed). When the proc was proc-ing another proc it was reasonable to conclude the mechanic was broken (fixed). That the OH can proc the effect is fine. When Mongooose procs on my offhand, I get haste and 120agi, not some nerfed version of Mongoose because it's offhand.

</div>I assert that it's broken only to the extent that it creates a balance nightmare.  And it does.<br>

And, in reality, Mongoose *is* weaker on your OH; it only maintains about half the uptime that your MH Mongoose generates... as opposed to Sword Spec which generates almost twice as much damage on your OH as it does on your MH.<br>

				(4) Some of us don't agree that the proposed solutions are the only ones or simple ones. In fact, if you read the above ideas, they often move horribly into the complex. "Remove the dual wield penalty" and then fix that elsewhere? Change multiple talent tiers in multiple trees? Occam's Razor need not apply. I have no interest in the second-order effects those will create and the need to nerf thiem later.<br>
<br>
And all due respect to Aldriana, the notion that those are the only two solutions and that by ruling out the second of them you have hit on the only possibly solution to this "problem" is not really easy to take seriously. You are capable of crafting so many good arguments, claiming some paired change between OH procs and Slice and Dice is the lone solution is off.
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>Again, I think you missed my point.  The point I was attempting to make with that example was very similar to your overall point here; most of the solutions being proposed that *don't* involve a nerf to sword spec are horribly convoluted, and require 10 separate buffs, each of which carefully crafted so as not to affect swords but increase the damage output of other specs, will be loaded with unintended consequences that would in turn need to be fixed, and so on.  Meanwhile, by coupling a slight sword spec nerf with a slight rogue buff, you bring them all into balance with only 2 simple changes.  Is this the only way to fix it?  No.  Are there other buffs and other ways of nerfing sword spec that would yield the same result?  For sure.  However, my point remains:  rebalancing rogues to be less reliant on sword spec is a far far easier fix than trying to leave Sword Spec the way it is and buff all the other talents to match, and, as such, is a) more likely to actually occur and b) less likely to introduce other balance issues that would need to be fixed down the line.<br>
<br>
Now, if you disagree that the specs should be equal - that's a totally separate issue, and I can definitely see the argument there.  On the other hand, I would argue that your analogy to mage specs is invalid.  If, for instance, fire spec vastly outdamaged any other raiding mage spec, but all the caster itemization in raid instances had only +frost damage on it, do you think the mages might perhaps complain?  I view this to be analagous to our situation.  There is one raid spec that is clearly superior to all others, and almost no itemization to support it, but tons of itemization to support inferior specs.  Thus, the case can be made that it would be advantageous to us, as a class, to have the ability to make use of that itemization.<br>
<br>
You're welcome to disagree, of course - that's why we have discussion forums.  I merely assert that *if* one wishes to bring the specs into parity, the most elegant solution proposed to date is to couple a slight nerf to sword spec with a matching buff to the class, and frankly I can't really see how there's an argument about that.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_522280"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Due respect intended but I re-read 1223, and you seem to say "nerf swords, add SnD time to help daggers". If you meant, nerf swords a bit and buff all rogues so that sword rogue dps is unchanged then fine. I agree that's reasonable. I don't agree there *needs* to be DPS equivalence, but I don't have a problem with DPS equivalence -- except with maces, which have a very weird, non-PVE benefit and therefore should either get a new bonus, or do less damage in PVE in aggregte. <br>
<br>
Now, to say that the existing itemization ought to be more useful and therefore we ought to have spec changes to make it so is again something I don't see a problem with. But that said, outside of places like this, I'm quite certain all those fists and daggers are indeed getting used. You see in post 1258 that some presumably somewhat high-end guild has 3 rogues who are clearly spec-ed in an inferior manner -- i.e. they don't make use of swords. And yet they invite 5 rogues to raids (which I personally find insane, but whatever works for them). If the poster was suggesting his guild's non-sword rogues match the damage of the sword rogues, then we again learn that skill &gt;&gt; theorycrafting. If he isn't saying that, then apparently, the inferior damage of non-sword rogues is fine for his guild.<br>
<br>
My point, which he somehow seems to be missing, is worth reiterating: Rogues at sword dps levels are sufficiently the best single target dpsers to justify being in raids at all. We have a nice, yet reasonable margin over other classes and enough fights where we can sit around and slice and dice away. If we are nerfed by 5% in damage, no serious theorycrafting guild is going to bother with rogues. And that's a very dangerous change to be advocating -- or even hiniting at.<br>
<br>
Blizzard has a way of taking these ideas and making them reality. Let's be awfully careful in what they are being fed. I'd rather have the imbalance in favor of swords persis --  swords are the best, but the other specs still allow people to top the meters -- than see a class-wide nerf after the damage done by the haste nerf. <br>
<br>
I find the argument in 1258 non-persuasive. You want me to prove the negative with regard to it being overpowered? Go to the soapbox -- aka the WoW forums -- and show me the clamor over the overpoweredness of sword spec. It's just not there. You can armory all day and show me that most elite guild rogues are swords right now and I'll again say so what? When Rag was the endgame, all elite mages were frost. Raiding hunters find one spec or the other superior at a given moment. That's always the case in WoW. There isn't perfect frost/fire/arcane balance in mages at the moment. There isn't perfect affliction/demo balance in locks. Etc. etc.<br>
<br>
And since I've mashed two totally different posts to reply to into one, I'm going to explain one thing again (though it's crystal clear above). "Off-hand Sword has 5% chance to proc a extra attack. For some reason it is a main-hand attack, and if your main-hand is not a Sword you still gain the attack on your main-hand. "<br>
<br>
I know. And so the proposal above was simple: End hybrid spec abuse. If the MH isn't a sword, sword spec can't proc from it. Done.<br>
<br>
The "strawman" is the notion you can't fix that problem without nerfing swords when in fact you can fix that problem with about 10 lines of code.<br>
<br>
Now Aldriana, having said that in response to Grunge, let me reiterate that I don't have a problem fixing the rest of the issue. But I'm simply not persuaded it's particularly necessary. Sword itemization is mediocre and yet you can get a S2 arena offhand in no time to upgrade Latro's and that'll keep you just fine. You can get a Vindictors or Arena weapon, hope for the Talon and move on. I wish there was more out there, but I'm not sure how this is any different than the same pathetic situation in vanilla. Krol.. wait forever... Brutaltiy... wait forever ... CTS. It was about a year between Krol and CTS for me. Blizzard doesn't much like to hand out weapon upgrades for whatever reason and I presume that's why many of us went to the arena to get them (they aren't perfect, but the S2 MH --&gt; Vindicators for me and after 6 months of not getting a Spiteblade, I deserved something).<br>
<br>
If the daggers and fists in SSC/TK are getting DE-ed, they're in good company. So much of that loot is borderline/sidegrade material it is what it is. Our shadow priest got the one item she needs... Our survival hunter waits on the 1-2 items she needs (and this across all 10 bosses). <br>
<br>
There are so many huge issues in WoW, this isn't one of them. At least as far as I'm concerned. And in this case, I think I speak for the majority. There are endless screams in the WoW forums about this warlock talent or that, about warrior overpoweredness in PVP or weakness in tanking for PVE. The "ZOMG sword rogues are OP" chorus is a pretty small one.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_522358"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->No need to nerf combat swords. Any nerf for rogues anywhere only risks us losing dps over all specs and weapons.<br>
<br>
Sword/sword is fine.<br>
Fist/sword is fine.<br>
I couldn't care less about the Subtelty tree. If they wanna buff it, buff it with extra pvp skills.<br>
Mutilate, I don't know what to think about it. I haven't seen many mutilate rogues. Maybe it could use some buffs.<br>
<br>
How to fix combat daggers ? Or combat fists ?<br>
<br>
Some suggestions:<br>
*) Improve the the dagger specialization to give up to 10% increased crit chance (6-10 or 2/4/6/8/10).<br>
*) Or improve the dagger and fist spec to give 1-5% aura *per weapon*. If you wear 2 daggers or fists, you get 10% increased critrating aura on both weapons. It would make offhand daggers and fist weapons certainly as viable as offhand swords.<br>
*) Decrease the cost of backstab. Maybe to 55 energy. Or 50 energy. Decrease it as much as is need to make similar geared dagger rogues do 5-10% more damage on stationary targets than sword/first rogues.<br>
*) Implement both last 2 suggestions<br>
*) Increase the dps of daggers further above the dps of swords found in the same instance. Still, while everyone agrees that swords are nicer, it isn't really easy to find anything above a Vindicator's Brand. You need luck to get a better sword. You need a lot of luck before you can outfit 4 rogues in your raid with Talons.<br>
<br>
There are many ways to do this. Simple ways. Ways that allows Blizzard to precisely buff dps to where it should be.<br>

The problem with daggers is this. A rogue can surprise his opponents in pvp (esp while ganking). Therefor he can stay behind a target until it is dead. Ambush/backstab/backstab gives great burst damage. If you increase dagger rogue's backstab even more than it is today, ganking becomes even simpler. 90% of Blizzard's customers wouldn't like that. Pvp is the limiting factor dagger rogue's pve dps.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_522411"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Combat dagger is simply a spec with zero harmony at the moment and it needs some work in my opinion. Alot of us predicted this during the TBC beta, even though the fact that OH daggers were way faster than OH swords made the gap to look slightly smaller than what it is now.<br>
<br>
Suggestions have been enough, even though I don't see blizzard actually making any real changes anytime soon.<br>
<br>
-Opportunity. Either get rid of it or make it a 2 or 3 points talent.<br>
-Lethality. *the* talent designed to work best with backstab. Funny enough, backstab rogues can't grab it fully.<br>
-SnD. There is no reason why this shouldn't be longer. Make improved backstab also increase the base duration by 5 sec for each rank, or just add a new rank.<br>
-Energy cost. Add a talent in combat which gives you 10 energy after each special attack critical strike. OR, make the white critical strikes have a chance to restore 5 energy. Both of those suggestions give a edge to daggers.<br>
-Base damage: Backstab's non crit damage is simply too low compared to SS. Either increase the base damage or increase the critical chance. (12% per rank instead of 10%).<br>
<br>
Any of the above will help backstab rogues to get back to where they really should be.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_522494"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I was running 8 piece bonescythe pre tbc, and the bonus I liked the most, was 5 energy per special crit. That really was awesome. If they did what Valen said, the combat dagger hybrid would be more competetive, and play better.<br>
<br>
Opportunity. This is a must for combat backstab builds, but it costs 5 points, and is in a different tree. If every dagger user takes a specific talent, doesnt that indicate something to blizzard? Lethality being the single talent that backstab builds shine the most, why can you not max it without gimping on lethality? It makes no sense.<br>
Base damage. I really do think the base damage of the highest backstab rank is just a little too low.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>So I guess Combat Daggers (15/41/5) is an Offbuild now?<br>
<br>
That ignorance is the same that midici spouts in his long dribble. Yes, I've gone to being an ass, sorry, some people don't understand otherwise.<br>
<br>
Combat builds are what? A cp generator + SnD based to get finishers.  They also require a fast OH to gain more combat potency procs and thus more dmg done from specials.<br>
<br>
Swords is a combat build.  Daggers is a combat build.  Both require a cp generator (SS or BS) + SnD uptime to reach a finisher.  They both require a fast OH to proc extra energy to create more dmg from specials.<br>
<br>
Swords allows for the OH swing to proc an MH attack.  It allows for the MH to proc a MH attack.  Does that seem logical, at all?  From a non-biased position, no person can logically say that having a weaker weapon do as much dmg as the stronger weapon is "working as intended".  <br>
<br>
Daggers adds 5% crit when wielding in the MH AND allows for +30% to crit on all BS's.  This means that a 30% crit rogue now crits 60% of his BS's.  Seems like a grand idea, until you look at equally geared sword and dagger rogues and see who comes out on top, but that's not the point of my post. (I would also point out that it's funny that fists also recieve 5% more crit and yet don't get any bonus to SS dmg or crit rate and is expected to level with swords).<br>
<br>
<br>
Mutilate, Hemo, Deep Sub and maces all have their place.  Whether its survivability, control, PvP Viability or world-ganking fun, all have a role OUTSIDE of 1 on 1 dps.  <br>
<br>
Swords allows for amazing 1 on 1 boss dmg, no matter where you are positioned on the boss.  It also allows for easy ganking in the World environment, as well as a completely viable PvP spec for most rogues.  <br>
<br>
Daggers is pretty amazing 1 on 1 boss dmg, only when stationed behind the target and he doesn't move.  You also have longer cycles meaning less SnD/Finisher up-time if the boss encounter isn't stagnant.  You have a CP Generator that costs 20 more energy than swords and does marginally more damage.  Also, the biggest point, when have you seen a 15/41/5 rogue running around AMBUSH BS BS people? They move away, you wasted energy on the Ambush, and even with 2 ticks you'll be lucky to get back behind them to BS BS again. <br>
<br>
I'm a sword rogue, waiting on our first ToA drop so that I can upgrade from Spiteblade.  I was combat daggers and hated it, so I went swords before the big "SWORDS IS WAYY BETTER".  I am still an advocate of swords being amazing dps, I love them, but don't think that daggers shouldnt equal or surpass our dps.  That's ignorance.  If a spec brings almost no other utility to the user, shouldn't he be gifted with excellent damage?  It follows the same line as overall rogue dps: If a rogue brings no other utility to the raid, but his dps and is forced to stand in melee range (more dmg done to him), shouldn't he be rewarded with more damage?  <br>
<br>
If they made the OH proc OH attacks and decreased the cost of a BS slightly or offered a faster OH dagger, possible upgraded <a class="itemlink q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=29275" target="_blank">[Searing Sunblade]</a> with ~100dps and increased the base BS dmg, I think you'd see them jump up a little on the dps charts and give rogues a chance to either wield daggers or swords and know they will be top dps.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_522834"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I read this thread every day and I hang on almost every word from Aldriana, Songster, Mojo and a few others.  So I apologize if I ruffle some feathers, I don't post here very often.<br>
<br>
<u>The whole and <b>PRIMARY</b> point behind having separate weapon and talent specializations is to offer flexibility in play style.</u>  If you're asking for all weapons to perform the same DPS, no matter the situation, then you might as well lose the weapons spec talents and give everyone 5% more crit or something stupid.<br>
<br>
I am a player who agrees that each Weapon Spec should have it's own Strengths and Weaknesses in PvP and PvE.  I agree that some weapons should excel at PvP but not at PvE and vise versa.  That, to me, is a part of class balance, even if the weapon has a suitable PvE/PvP spec.<br>
<br>
Aldriana, If you balance all weapons the same DPS in PvE, you will still nullify some weapons from PvP usefulness and continue this absurd sword vs. dagger debate.  With talents such as Mutilate it's obvious that Blizzard intended daggers to have builds advantageous to PvP, Sword and Fist have no such specialized builds.<br>
<br>
The sooner all rogues accept that certain weapons and builds offer strengths and weakness to the different play styles, the sooner this debate can end.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
Thanks for the insult, by the way. It was incredibly necessary and mature. <br>
<br>
I fail to see why you don't get it, but you bet we can say it's working as intended. The weaker attack is not doing the damage. The extra mainhand attack is doing the additional damage. That's the way the mechanic was built and it's part of the game. It's no different than any other set of mechanics that fail to pass the *logic test* of the real world but make sense in WoW. Incidentally, I'm guessing the mace stun effect procs from the offhand too, which makes the mace OH benefit equally powerful no matter what hand it procs from.<br>
<br>
What I find ironic about your tirade, is you actually prove the point. Too many encounters don't allow for easy backstab spamming. So maybe Blizzard is sending a message that combat daggers is not the preferred raid spec anymore. How many bosses are in partial or constant movement or rotation or what not. Fact is we still all endeavor to attack from behind, but we don't have to when we swing swords. <br>
<br>
This notion that somehow Blizzard in its grand vision intended for the specs to be equal, accidentally overpowered sword spec by a shocking few percentage points in dps, and needs to fix this lest the WoW universe collapse into burning rubble is absurd. It could very well be intended. And even if it isn't, it's very player friendly to have the rogues wielding swords.<br>
<br>
What to make of all the daggers that might drop then? Well, hmmm, they might not be the greatest raid items. Like the resilience items in SSC. Or the one that helps you avoid silence effects. Or the vast majority of two handers quite honestly. Lots of raid loot drops that isn't all that helpful for raids. And lots of people sit around waiting for a relatively small number of drops.<br>
<br>
Many people made my point through persuasive arguments of their own after your insult, but I'll add one more thing. A build of 15/41/5 sounds pretty offspec to me. Most builds involve two talent trees, not dumping 5 points in the third one. I realize opportunity is an important backstab talent, perhaps what you really need is to get that put into assassination somewhere to avoid forcing 5 pts in a 3rd tree when what you really need is 3 pts in assassination and 2 pts to put elsewhere in said tree? I don't really know.<br>
<br>
But I do know amidst my dribble that there is absolutely nothing sacrosanct about multiple combat buiilds having mathematically identical dps. I also know there is equaly nothing sacrsanct about rogues being associated with daggers. Once upon a time priests were associated primarily with healing in raids. Paladins would've been laughed at for suggesting they could tank. Ditto druids. The game changes. Maybe you need to adapt.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
IMO the rogue talent tree and the "additions" to pre-TBC talents and minor changes, are out-dated and talents seriously needs a make-over, aswell as mechanisms for rogues.<br>
<br>
If you look at Backstab vs. Sinister Strike, BS has - with Imp BS - 1.35 dmg per energy per second, while SS has 1.4 dpe/s. As such, Imp BS and SS are (almost) balanced, in terms of dpe/s; BS could use a little tweak though. Anyways...<br>
<br>
The problems arise when applied to combat. If we look at a 20/41 spec for both swords and daggers (using merciless weapons - identical gear), daggers fall aprx 7% dps behind swords, simply because 3s/5s/5r for daggers is a aprx 26 second longer rotation than 3s/5r for swords.<br>
<br>
IMO the main issue is the 60 energy for BS vs. the 40 energy for SS. While both attacks are balanced in terms of dpe/s, the build-up of CP is prolonged by 50% by BS, which directly translates to a loss of finishing move damage in rotation over time. One way of adressing this, could be to change dagger specialization to 10% increased damage from eviscerate / rupture per talent point, rather than 1% critical strike. Another way could be to change Imp BS from adding critical damage to reducing energy required (5 less energy per talent points).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>To be clear: the argument was never that daggers should be better than swords.  The argument was that daggers should, at least, be a reasonable alternative to swords, which they're really not at the moment.  The crux of the disagreement is how to go about resolving this - how close they should actually be, and what aspects of the class should be buffed/nerfed to get there.<br>
<br>
As a final point before I drop the topic of discussion: I personally would be somewhat opposed to dropping the energy cost of Backstab, as, while it would certainly buff the spec, it would also diminish the differences between sword spec and dagger spec; in my opinion, part of the difference between them, and the appeal of one versus the other, is that they *do* maintain rather different cycles and energy management capabilities.  If you play swords for a while and want a change of pace, you can play daggers for a different experience, and vice versa.  I would worry that this distinction would be lost if the energy differential between them were reduced.  Again: this is not to say that daggers don't need a buff relative to swords; they do.  But I don't think adjusting the energy cost would be my preferred solution.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_523387"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Actually, I have a technical question about the way cycles are modeled on this spreadsheet.

</div>So, you're advocating a list of "largest available upgrades from selected instances"?  It certainly seems possible, although I'd have to think a bit about the right way to do it and where to put the resulting values - the Talents_Equipment page is already pretty crowded, and the Advanced Settings page is about to have a lot of stuff added to it as well.  I kind of hate to give it it's own page, but... that might turn out to be best.<br>
<br>
On that note, I'd like to open up a little discussion:  What information not currently displayed (other than stat summaries and next-stat information, which are already planned) would you like to see displayed?  I will compile a list of people's ideas, and, from that, we can work out the best way to organize everything.<br>
<br>
For that matter, if you have ideas about features in general, let me know and, again, I will see what I can do.<br>
<br>
To be honest, however, I'm pretty busy right now, between work, various other engagements, and some other side projects I'm working on, so it may be a few weeks until I'm able to work on the spreadsheet again in earnest.  I don't have any real expectation of getting another revision out before Thanksgiving.  If, however, there are those among you that feel you have a pretty good grasp of the spreadsheet and Excel/OO, I would welcome any assistance you may feel like providing.  If you're interested, send me a PM and we'll work out the details.<br>
<br>
On another note, in order to try to prevent this thread from getting mired down again, I would like to compile links to some of the most interesting/important/worth reading/worth referencing/whatever posts from the thread, so in addition to the FAQ section on the front page I can add a "recommended reading" section, to try to cut down on the number of repetitive questions.  So if there are posts you feel should be so linked, and/or other questions you'd like to see addressed in the FAQ, PM me with your suggestions and I'll update the first post accordingly.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

With this list I can see the relative "upgrade" values of different pieces of gear. And I can compare prices between them. While I might feel my rings are the worst pieces of my gear I can see that I'd actually need the bracers almost twice as much as I need the Akama ring. I can see that t6 gloves should be my first priority (that I can obtain), and that t6 shoulders aren't as necessary if I can get Swiftstrike for free. If something drops I can see if the item is near the top of my list or near the bottom and end up with a good metric for deciding how much DKP to wager on it.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_523434"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Thanks for the help getting the spreadsheet working. Now, I've got a question about the results it generated. It suggested that I use 5s5r3s. (Note: I've got the 2-piece t4 bonus.)<br>
<br>
That circuit seems off to me. For one, shouldn't I be opening with a much smaller combo point SnD (so that it's up immediately), and for that matter, isn't generating 5 points for any finishing move unreasonable as a Combat Dagger build? Or is the expectation that I Sinister Strike as often as I need to pull up the CP's and only BS when I have available energy? (I guess part of that question is, is the spreadsheet adjusting for Dagger over Swords?)<br>
<br>
My Armory is here: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080616084618/http://www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Magtheridon&amp;n=Alphona" target="_blank">The World of Warcraft Armory</a><br>
<br>
Also, I have a more general question. What do you all do during things like Maulger's Whirlwind and Gruel's Ground Shake, when it seems like you'll lose a lot of DPS having to back away from the target? Do you restart the circuit after that? Or do you try to shiv them up to 5 stacks of poison and rupture them before you have to back off to try to mitigate the loss?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_524092"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Abacus probably shouldn't be factored into the cycle computation, but, at the moment, it is.<br>
<br>
However, as a general rule of thumb: the cycles modeled in the sheet are very very tight.  While they are sustainable in the average case over the long term, in practice if you tried to do the cycle as listed, your SnD will drop periodically (as the energy bar is not large enough to absorb the variance).  Hence, even if the sheet is recommending 3s5r, you probably can't actually sustain 3s5r without losing SnD uptime.<br>
<br>
Now, for the variable-rupture cycles, this isn't really that big an issue; if the recommendation is 1s3.7r, it's easy to tell when you need to drop a point of rupture to get the next SnD up.  However, with the variable SnD cycles, this is harder; if the cycle is 3.3s5r, it's hard to know when you're going to need to work in a 4-point SnD, and when you're not.  Hence, my general rule of thumb for such cycles would be to use an SnD at least half a point larger than what the sheet recommends; that is, if it is advocating 3.2s5r, you should probably just plan to use 4s5r and not worry about trying to squeeze 3-point SnDs in.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_524102"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->hi, this site is awesome. some of you guys are brilliant and are making me feel pretty dumb. im sorry for making such a long post, please feel free to ignore it.<br>
<br>
i want to ask a question about dagger vs sword to some people who can explain it correctly to me. i just started playing again after along time and was really surprised to hear that swords outdps daggers. but i dont know if thats for overall after long raids, or for minute long tests, or just for 15 seconds of AR. what i want to know is if the balance shifts during adrenaline rush, because i had been planning on an 8/31/22 AR/prep spec with daggers for arena. i am mainly worried about dmg during AR, because i plan to have 30 seconds of it every fight.<br>
<br>
this is the way im guessing things work. i really dont know for sure if this is right but this is how i see it. <br>
<br>
what i think is that the different combo point generation rates between SS and BS mean that a larger percent of sword spec's dmg comes from finishing moves than with daggers, because it has so many more to spend. so if theyre relatively close in dmg, i hear its about 5-6% more with swords, than dagger is probably getting a larger percent of its total dmg from energy spent on BS than sword is getting from energy spent on SS. and if finishing moves are a somewhat smaller portion of the dmg pie than white dmg and SS/BS, then maybe daggers gets a larger % in dmg increase during adrenaline rush than swords do.<br>
<br>
what i mean is this, with made up numbers. pretend on sword spec finishing moves account for 20% (putting extra dmg from SnD in this category and not in white), white accounts for 40%, and SS account for 40%. with daggers, white accounts for 38%, finishing moves account for 14%, BS accounts for 48%. im guessing daggers would get less from white dmg because sword spec will push white dmg a bit higher. and im saying sword spec gets more dmg from finishing moves because of much higher CP generation.<br>
<br>
if you doubled dmg from finishing moves and BS/SS due to AR, daggers compared to swords do slightly more dmg relative to what they did before, even though sword would probably still be higher overall. and i also want to assume that there are diminishing returns on dmg caused by finishing moves during adrenaline rush. because you move from the most effective use of CPs to a less effective use. and during adrenaline rush you get farther into the diminishing returns than normal because you have so many more CPs. so that would affect sword spec's total dmg more sharply than daggers.<br>
<br>
does this seem right or wrong? and also, since i think that when people say swords are better theyre talking about against mobs with no resilience. so would that mean that even if BS was better than sword during AR, this wouldnt be true anymore after resilience and i should just give up on it?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_524165"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I don't think there's a fundamental problem with examining the differences between swords and daggers in terms of how they perform in practice; I think where we got into trouble before is when we started speculating about how to fix it, and, in particular, when people started posting without reading the other responses.<br>
<br>
With regards to the specific question at hand:<br>
<br>
Daggers do get more of their damage from backstab than swords do from Sinister Strike; however, AR also increases your combo point generation so also gives finisher damage; as such, I'm not aware of any major selective pressure favoring swords or daggers.<br>
<br>
Additionally, from a PvE perspective 8/31/22 would be weak, because it's lacking Relentless Strikes, the single best talent point any rogue can spend.  From a PvE perspective, you'd far rather have Relentless Strikes than AR and should thus spec something more along the lines of 11/28/22.<br>
<br>
Moreover, typically Hemo builds are swords, not daggers; hence, doing that build with daggers would be unusual to say the least.<br>
<br>
With regards to PvP viability: can't help you.  This sheet is designed solely for sustained PvE situations.  If you want help with your PvP spec, I'd recommend heading over to the PvP forum.<br>
<br>
However, before doing so, I would also clean up my spelling and capitalization, as the moderators tend to get cranky if you don't.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Well it definitely is a significant boost to the power of the ring (assuming you have Weapon Expertise), but I do not think it compares to any of the raiding rings. Here's why:<br>
<br>
With the new stats, it should grant 20 Expertise Rating = 5 Expertise = -0.25%*5 to be dodged = -1.25% to be dodged. Just to give you a better grasp of the comparison (for simplicity's sake while sacrificing a bit of accuracy), since -1% dodge ~ +1% Hit, you're basically getting a ring with 25 Agility and 20 Hit Rating, which isn't really all that great.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Pre-2.3 it's one of the best rings for Mutilate rogues if you lack the +5 weaponskill from any other source. <br>
Post-2.3 it's lackluster at best. Think of it this way. -1.25% dodge is somewhat equal to ~1.25% hit. <br>
so it's 25agi, 18sta, ~1.25%"hit" (in reality the benefit from -dodge is better due to less dodged specials, but the difference is minimal at best.)<br>

		<div id="post_message_524258"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Last night, during Kara, I got the Steelhawk Crossbow. (The Stiletto also dropped, but the other rogue received that.) For all intents and purposes, the Crossbow is better than my current throwing weapon, so I replaced that. But I've got two questions.<br>
<br>
1) According to the spreadsheet the Crossbow ranks higher than the Stiletto (57.11 V. 49.21). Is this because the Crossbow does higher DPS? (A fact that would be negligible for any rogue really using it.) Or are the Crossbow's stats (HR 16, AP 30) really much better than the Stiletto's (HR 12, Critical Strike 20)?<br>
<br>
2) I asked earlier about what to do during AOE attacks. I've never had the 'shoot' ability before, so I'm wondering - during an AOE where I need to back away from the mob (whirlwind, or Gruul's ground slam),  should I use shoot until I can melee again? Or will the DPS gain be negligible and not particularly worth it?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_524603"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->A missed special costs you at most 2 seconds for refreshing your cycle, and unless you're running extremely tight cycles (which is usually a bad idea anyway), it generally won't even cost you that much.  Yes, it can occasionally induce and SnD gap, but with careful energy management this will be rare.  Regardless, this is implicitly factored in to the spreadsheet calculation referenced in post 1106, which also exhibits a variation of very close to 10%.  In practice, of course, it's a hard think to model exactly, so the variance might be a bit larger than that; but it's still a lot closer to 10% than 25%, much less 50%.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Obviously the dps hit of 2 talent points out of imp/vile poisons is negligible, you could do a lazy 5s/5ea cycle gear a super-easy cycle or put in some ruptures if you had a lot of spare combo points.

		<!-- message -->
		<div id="post_message_525637"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->So I have been reading the posts back and forth and have come to some confusion when it comes down to balancing Lethality vs Ruthlessness vs Murder for a Combat Dagger rogue.<br>
<br>
Typicall on those three talents you have six points to spend.  Two have to be spent on either murder OR Ruthlessness at a minimum.  Where are the points most effecitvely spent with the follow assumptions:<br>
<br>
1.  At least 2/3 if not all mobs are murderable. (SSC/TK style break downs)<br>
2.  Combat Rogue build of 15/41/5<br>
<br>
<br>
If a single mob isn't murderable the choice is obvious due to the fact you have to spend the two points anyway and they are best spent in Ruthlessness but the waters muddy in my opinion when you look at the three vs each other.<br>
<br>
Is it ever worth putting 2 points in murder and three in to Ruthlessness and then one in to lethality?  Or is there some other combo (2,2,2 or 2,1,3 or ??? respectively) that may work better in practice?<br>
<br>
I can run it through the spreadsheet but I am wondering how well the extra combo points gained by Ruthlessness scale with the other two.<br>
<br>
Now let's go on to assume murder isn't viable against a mob.  Is it ever worth maxing out Ruthlessness and sacrificing lethality?  Just curious on that one.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Good call.  My guild may fair a bit differently however though considering we OFTEN have a druid tanking.  Also, would the *slight* dmg (and thus threat...) increase for the prot warrior at all balance the lost threat from Sunder/Devastate?

		<div id="post_message_525669"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Tanks are fairly reliant on Sunder for aggro, so if using Expose prevents them from doing so it's certainly a bad idea.  However, what's not clear to me is what happens in the following situations:<br>
<br>
1) Tank puts Sunders up.<br>
2) After 5 sunders are up, rogue puts Expose Armor up.<br>
3) Tank uses devastate<br>
<br>
That is: does Expose Armor actually remove the existing Sunders?  And if it doesn't, can Devastate still refresh the Sunders even if they couldn't normally be applied?  I sort of doubt this works, but I've never actually tested so can't say for certain.<br>
<br>
Regarding Murder/Lethality/Ruthlessness: I believe there are numbers earlier in this thread regarding the relative merit of some of these talents, but my recollection is that the answer is something like the following:<br>

Murder, on those mobs that it affects, is better than either of the other options, and by a fair amount.  Hence, if you're in an area where most things are Murderable (which may include SSC/TK but certainly does not include Hyjal/BT), it can make sense to put the talent points there.<br>
<br>
At least 2 points in Ruthlessness are borderline essential for most dagger rogues, as it's very hard to maintain a decent cycle without it.  The third point is, also pretty good.<br>
<br>
Hence, most people tend to do 2/3 Ruthlessness 4/5 Lethality.  3/3 Ruthlessness 3/5 Lethality is also a viable option, particularly with 2/5 T4 in that it allows you to use a much shorter cycle than you otherwise could.  Dropping 2 additional points from Lethality for Murder is uncommon but not totally ludicrous.<br>
<br>
For more detailed comparisons, I'd recommend plugging your gear into the spreadsheet and trying out the various options.  There will be some degree of personal preference involved, as, for instance, the Ruthlessness/Lethality tradeoff is a matter of whether you get more DPS from cycles (i.e. finishers) or more DPS from backstab directly.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Several posts back, Aldriana elicited suggestions and perhaps I have one.  My understanding is that WoW truncates values such as 12.5% to 12%.  If this is correct, I think it would be beneficial to list the total hit and/or crit percentages from talents and rating since it may be, in a situation wherein one is not expecting immanent changes, to socket a different gem to pass a percentage milestone.  If I cannot get from 12.5% to 13%, would it not be better to socket straight agi for AP or crit to perhaps go from 22.8% to more than 23%.<br>

If this is beneficial and easy to do, I would appreciate it.  If I am incorrect in my assumption, please correct me.</div>

		<!-- message -->
		<div id="post_message_528408">(I figured out my problem, Adriana, thanks...)<br>
<br>
Is there a bug with the way off-hand optimals are displayed? I currently don't have a real off-hand dagger (I'm using Blade of Unrequited Love until I get one). The blade is being calculated as 934, in contrast to better off-hands like Gladiator's Shiv (486). My new overall rough DPS changes appropriately when I swap the blade out for the shiv (it goes from 641 to 651), but the value in the off-hand row doesn't reflect that shift. I assume it's because the value for off-hands is being calculated off the same system as mainhands (and in fact, the blade is 918 in the main-hand slot).</div>

		<div id="post_message_528447">Well, my first observation would be that Blade of the Unrequited isn't in the spreadsheet by default, so you (or someone) must have added it at some point; given which, I have three possible theories:<br>
<br>
1) Blade of the Unrequited is socketed, unlike all the weapons in the sheet by default.  I make no claims to the quality of the weapon-socketing algorithms; Darlal implemented it originally, and I haven't touched it since; hence a) I can't vouch that it worked in the first place, and b) I can't vouch that I haven't screwed it up since.  Thus, it's possible that there's some sort of bug with the weapon-socketing.<br>
<br>
2) All the existing OH daggers in the sheet are either speed 1.3 or 1.4; it's entirely possible that the calculation method I used screws up somehow when used with a slower weapon like Blade of the Unrequited (1.6).  It's certainly the case that even if I got the calculations right, the resulting values will be less accurate due to nonlinearities in the value of weapon skill<br>
<br>
3) Alternately, it could simply be that whoever added it to the sheet simply copied the MH weapon scoring function rather than the OH scoring function while adding it and, as such, it's being scored by a different (and incorrect) formula.<br>
<br>
Without knowing how it was added, I can't tell you which of the above is correct.  But my guess would be the third.</div>

		<div id="post_message_529712">Greetings Ald. Let me start with the mandatory introduction thanking you for your work and pointing out how awesome you are. <br>
<br>
Now onto questions. I was wondering about endgame gemming, more specific about the good ol` debate about the value of hit versus agility and considering now is one better versus the other in ideal situation or interrupted fights (majority of them).<br>
<br>
Thing is, i am at the point where i just started to get my BT loot and i was wandering how to gem it to get the most out of it.<br>
<br>
I could use 10hit gems and easily reach 300hit (by using the Ashtongue talisman, since VR never dropped WSC)<br>
<br>
On the other hand i could use 5agi/5hit gems in most of the slots and get something like 258 hit rating granting me a bit more agility (crit, ap, etc etc).<br>
<br>
Let me just point out that money belt is gonna be my endgame belt (i just LOVE the stamina i get from it) and i just got insidious bands (yay for me) what basically motivated me to write this post. Gems are not an issue as we tend o loot loads of yellow and a fair amount of orange ones.<br>

On the other hand i could use 5agi/5hit gems in most of the slots and get something like 258 hit rating granting me a bit more agility (crit, ap, etc etc).<br>
<br>
Let me just point out that money belt is gonna be my endgame belt (i just LOVE the stamina i get from it) and i just got insidious bands (yay for me) what basically motivated me to write this post. Gems are not an issue as we tend o loot loads of yellow and a fair amount of orange ones.<br>
<br>
Your thoughts?</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>I think ultimately this comes down to a matter of personal preference.  The first thing I'd note is that there's really no wrong answer here, since the difference between socketing everything with 5agi/5hit and socketing everything with 10 hit is typically well under 1% of your DPS in a raid setting (for instance, with my current gear/buffs, the difference is roughly 5 DPS out of 1500).  So either way you choose is not going to make a huge difference to your raid DPS.<br>
<br>
On the whole, the tradeoff is between a small amount of DPS on sustained fights versus some dodge and a speculative amount of damage on interrupted fights.  Since there isn't really a good model of interrupted fights (yet), it's really hard to say what the exact damage tradeoff is; so, ultimately, we're all just guessing.<br>
<br>
In terms of what my best guess is as to which is better: I personally lean towards 5agi/5hit over 10 hit.  I don't really have any numbers to support this, so don't quote me on it; but that's my best guess for the moment.</div>

And you sir could read my post prior to b***h about. And just to put this behind us; i get about 8 DPS difference according to spreadsheet gemming pure hit versus agi/hit.<br>
<br>
@ Ald: Thanks for the answer. I`ve decided to go all out on agi/hit and to keep my hit 250-ish as a result. Another thing. In a recent post you said there is a point when you get your gear to a certain level that you could gem pure agility, therefore adjust your rotation to 5s/5r to gain a benefit. Since i am leaning towards agility somehow lately (please understand i was a hit-junkie not so long ago) was thinking to go 5s/5r already with the current gear. Spreadsheet suggest 3.3s/5r. I know the difference should be minimal but lets say i want to get the best possible out of my gear for the sake of the argument.</div>

At 5 CP and with T5 2pc, Eviscerate deals 1245 damage plus 15% of your AP for 35 energy, or roughly 35.57 damage plus 0.43% of your AP per energy. Applying 3/3 Improved Eviscerate and 3/3 Aggression (121% modifier), 40% crit and RED (142.4% modifier), and 30% armor reduction (assuming a typical debuffed raid boss), Eviscerate comes to 42.90 damage plus 0.52% of your AP per energy. Thus, Eviscerate holds an advantage of 2.90 base damage per energy, but Rupture gains an additional 0.44% of your AP. At this rate, it takes only 656 AP for Rupture to overcome Eviscerate's base advantage. Simply, in any situation where you can Rupture, you should Rupture.</div>

</div>I'm pretty sure I mentioned this somewhere before, but, if I didn't: I never implemented the steep nonlinearity in the value of weapon skill in this sheet and just used .1% hit per point even for the first 5; hence, simply removing it from a build doesn't actually knock your miss rate up to 28%.  The reason for this is that including something so nonlinear would, at times, cause serious scoring difficulties for some items, so I decided to keep the scoring more or less consistant and let the damage estimates be off in low weapon skill situations.<br>
<br>
To actually get 28% base miss, one would need to go to lines 70 and 74 of each calculation sheet and change the 25.5 to a 28.<br>
<br>
Note, however, that this will not account for the fact that your dodged rate will be lower than modeled by the sheet, so answers derived directly from that won't be wholly accurate either.</div>

</div>4 bosses in BT, actually; Naj'entus, Akama, Gurtogg, and Council.  Doesn't change the underlying point though, namely: while Murder is pretty useful in the T5 instances, it's value drops pretty dramatically in the T6 instances.<br>

That said, SS rogues tend to take it anyway for lack of anything better as a prereq to lethality/relentless strikes.  Dagger rogues, on the other hand, have better things to be taking.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I don't understand why the S3 offhand would be considered better than Savagery.  I've always been under the impression that for every .1 decrease in weapon speed you gain ~10 dps because of combat potency.  Add to that the extra 7hit rating, 1 crit rating and 10ap vs S3's extra 2.6dps and 49 armor reduction and I fail to see why you make the argument that S3 is better.<br>
<br>
Based off of the damage calculations on the spreadsheet the following AP values for each weapon's additional total stats(including the armor reduction) are:<br>
<br>
Savagery:  115.85<br>
S3:  106.28<br>
<br>
That will vary some based on every individual's gear, but I can't see the changes being so dramatic that it would outweigh the value of the reduced weapon speed on savagery.<br>

<br>
Just recently, I received the Deathmantle Handguards, and managed to put the final nail in the coffin of my 2pc Netherblade bonus (Engineering Hat, T5 Gloves and Shoulders, Bloodsea Brigand's vest, and if I ever stop being a cheap bastard I'll toss some cobrahide leather armor onto my Skulker's Greaves, or pick up the T5 leggings since rogues are probably going to be guaranteed the next several drops of them since we've been passing to all the paladins/shamans, and in some cases even paladin or shaman offspecs.<br>
<br>
Now, we're currently *working* on Vashj, which means that the 4pc bonus is probably not in my very near future, as I would need to pick up both the legs and the hat in our first couple kills before we go into hardcore kael attempts.<br>
<br>
In any event, rupture is strictly superior to eviscerate in ideal circumstances. Ideal circumstances being defined as being high Time-on-Target or availability of target to attack, vulnerability to rupture, one target with high HP, with little switching between adds.<br>
<br>
In T5 content, that means... Morogrim, more or less. Also Vashj, at least for P1 and P3, depending on whether you're playing with elementals (as backup) or Nagas (sometimes). Vashj is a special case anyway, because the Nagas and Elementals are level 72 (??) and thus less hit rating is required in general, so it might be optimal to scale your gear differently?<br>
<br>
To get to the main point: A valuation of 0 AP to the T5 2pc bonus doesn't seem entirely fair.<br>
<br>
Al'ar: P1 Add DPS, rupture uptime not optimal due to the impossibility of predicting flame quill. P2: Using up spare CP before meteor.<br>
Solarian: Adds/priests, and very low armor P1, as well as the desirability of blowing CPs on extra damage before the split.<br>
VR: Immune to rupture, moot point.<br>
<br>
Hydross: Immune poison<br>
Lurker: Eh, depends, you might want to blow an SnD before the submerge to have extra DPS for the adds, but again, rupture isn't entirely optimal given low HP adds, etc.<br>
Morogrim: Rupture reigns supreme, 90% + Time On Target.<br>
Leo: Rupture reigns supreme, aggro sensitivity, especially to burst aggro, and periodic aggro wipes, with a low time on target that actually manages to reward having periodic damage up, but eviscerate can get your demons down more quickly if you can gen CP. Still, rupture wins due to WW and other random garbage.<br>
FLK: Rupture but if the totems had just a little bit more health, it'd be evisc. Also depends on whether you blade flurry shaman/hunter together, in which case that initial evisc/envenom would be superior.<br>
<br>
So, at least at the current point in my progression, valuing the T5 bonus at 0 seems to be a bit odd.<br>
<br>
Essentially, because of the 50AP weighting to the 2pc T4 bonus, it looks like wearing T4 shoulders over T5 would be the better choice (since I don't have the T4 hat). My experience would seem to suggest otherwise, as would initial experimentation (and the fact that I need to get back into the habit of using a 3s/5r cycle).<br>
<br>
Any thoughts on a "prospective" valuation of the T5 bonus under those circumstances? If it was as little as even 25AP, it would be worth maintaining the 2pc T5 bonus over downgrading any individual piece of gear from its current piece for the sake of gaining back the T4 bonus. 30-35AP, given the nature of the fights we're currently running across, seems entirely reasonable.<br>

Couple things I think you're looking at the wrong way.  Giving the 2pc T5 bonus a 0 value is because evicerate is not even considered in this spreadsheet due to the fact that it comes no where close to the value of rupture in terms of damage per energy point.  Under no 'real world' circumstance could we see evicerate overtaking rupture in DPE, the math has been done several times in this thread and others.  Since this spreadsheet is designed around the idea of endless uninterrupted combat in which a mob IS poisonable and not immune to bleed effects rupture is the clear choice.<br>
<br>
Second, the fact that rupture is the only choice for this spreadsheet does not mean Aldriana and others think evicerate is useless, we all use it because clearly in many cases we have to.  The 2pc T5 bonus only has a 0 value because evicerate is not modeled in this spreadsheet.  We all use evic sometimes, but adding it to this spreadsheet doesn't contribute to it's purpose of comparing gear under the given assumptions.<br>
<br>
As has been said many times, this spreadsheet provides suggestions, not commands.  Acknowledge the assumptions used by this spreadsheet before making your choices.  There is value to items that increase your dmg on Trash and poison/bleed immune mobs, it's just not modeled here.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_536340"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Kytrarewn: I hope I understand your point, that the T5 2pc set bonus should have some value. The idea of the spreadsheet (which has been discussed ad nauseum) is to calculate DPS for ideal circumstances. Putting together spreadsheets for interrupted fights would not only be difficult but also incredibly tedious because there are so many different options for killing "adds." Therefore the T5 2-piece set bonus is not valued, because obviously under ideal circumstances you wouldn't be using Eviscerate.<br>
<br>
As for some of your examples:<br>
Solarian: As you can see in the Boss Armor Values thread, Solarian, surprisingly, doesn't have that little armor as you would expect. Besides, you would need a rediculous amount of crit and the boss to have very, very low armor to make Eviscerate's DPE competitive with Rupture's.<br>
<br>
FLK: Even if you were Blade Flurry'ing the mobs together, that'd be one, maybe two 5-pt Eviscerates while Flurry'ing, and 200 to 400 extra damage there is absolutely nothing. The rest of the time you'd still use Rupture. <br>
<br>
Obviously when killing adds there are going to be times when Rupture is inferior to Eviscerate, but that really wasn't what the spreadsheet was designed to model nor are those times very many.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_536440"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Reread the first sentence in my post, and you'll see that I wasn't so much arguing with the spreadsheet as I was looking for other peoples' experiences to supplement it.<br>
<br>
I'm not saying that it should have a value in a spreadsheet that's designed around 'ideal situations'. And in fact, it's probably absolutely impossible to model.<br>
<br>
But, as far as its actual value? It isn't 0, and very few people would argue that it is. That's why I asked for "GUT FEELING" on its value, which seems to me to be 20-25AP, and would like to know if anyone else has a "GUT FEELING" on its actual value, as I believe I gave significant examples of places where you might use evisc/envenom over rupture that you could, perhaps, assign a "GUT FEELING" to the value of the bonus.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

But anyway, I do not think it will be a good idea to give it a value. Of course, there are sometimes you would use eviscrate over rupture, those times are very scarce and the extra damage you gain from the set is minimal.<br>

		<div id="post_message_536728"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I just did a little paper math which is probably grossly inaccurate.  Assuming a 30% armor mitigation and 25% crit rate and spamming evic every...I'll say 30 seconds which I think is generous for a 5point evic, it puts your average increase at 175 dmg.  That is 5.83dps.  Compare that to whatever increase the 2pc T4 gives and the increase/decrease in stats you get from switching from T4 to T5 and there's your answer.<br>
<br>
EDIT:  Did a quick look, adding 1ap to my spreadsheet gives about .34dps.  If the 2pc T4 bonus is valued at 50 for you then that's ~17 dps for you.  Interesting to note that set bonus is only worth 2.34ap for my current gear....<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div><br>
Doing some quick spreadsheet work with both the gear and DPS spreadsheets, the value of 1AP is about 0.2-0.25 DPS for me right now.<br>
<br>
Considering the '3DPS' number that I came up with earlier, or one 5pt evisc every 90 seconds (including crit rate and 20% armor), that comes out to an average of 3DPS or 5AP on average.<br>
<br>
As such, the set bonus seems to be ~ 12-15AP, or just BARELY enough that it's worthwhile to use the deathmantle/skulker's/engineering pieces over using the netherblade equivalents (since the deathmantle handguards, engineering hat, and bloodsea brigand's vest are definitive upgrades).<br>
<br>
Skulkers =&gt; Netherblade is a loss of ~ 19 effective AP.<br>
Deathmantle =&gt; Netherblade shoulders is a loss of about 27 effective AP.<br>
<br>
Netherblade 2pc bonus is weighted at 56AP.<br>
<br>
So, weighing in the 2pc T5 bonus at 10AP (3DPS x 3AP/DPS) we end up being able to justify wearing the T5 pieces over the netherblade equivalents.<br>
<br>
Is it tighter than I'd like it to be? Yes, probably, but it also allows us to justify taking T5 pieces on the way to the very significant 4pc bonus.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>It's not a huge difference.  On a blasted lands mob after 25mins of attacking with each build the difference was 35dps unbuffed without using cooldowns.

				<strong>Boundless Agony &gt; Fang of Vashj?</strong>
			</div>
			<hr size="1" style="color:#FFFFFF">
			<!-- / icon and title -->
		
		
		<!-- message -->
		<div id="post_message_540861">Hi. First off, thanks for all the hard work put into this spreadsheet. It really is an invaluable resource and has upped my game considerably.<br>
<br>
This may have already been answered, but I had a question about the respective worth of Boundless Agony vs. the Fang of Vashj. I'm combat daggers (15/41/5) despite the dps-gimp as compared to swords, mainly because I enjoy playing daggers and because there's a glut of sword rogues in my guild. At any rate, I noticed the Boundless Agony is listed as an upgrade to Fang of Vashj on the Roguecraft 101 Spreadsheet, ostensibly based on the info given here.<br>
<br>
Now, with the Fang of Vashj in my MH (Searing Sunblade in OH), it has a value of 1197.06 and says the Boundless Agony is a 14.31 UG. However, putting the Boundless Agony in my MH has a value of 1146.30 (i.e., -50) <br>
<br>
I realize the changes are somewhat dependent on everything else I'm wearing. Regardless, I guess my question is, would y'all consider the Boundless Agony a worthwhile UG to the Fang of Vashj to spend DKP on, or is it just a sidegrade? I presume some people will answer, "use the spreadsheet, yo", but the spreadsheet seems to tell me it's a <i>downgrade</i>, which is not how it's spelled out on the roguecraft thread.<br>
<br>
Thanks in advance and, once again, great job.</div>

It really boils down what works best with your equipment. If you already have some Armor Pen, Boundless Agony might get on top due to increased gain when stacking Armor Pen. Fang of Vashj looks more like a generally good Dagger, Weapon Expertise, AP, Stamina. And don't forget that you loose the expertise rating when switching the Fang for Boundless Agony, which is one of the top3 stats in 2.3 to have.<br>
<br>
Generally i'd say its a sidegrade or even dare saying "pvp gimmick". On a more objective note, plug it in the spreadsheet, if its within 20 EAP of the old, watch the resulting dps closely, if its less than a double digit change, don't bother shelling out major DKP.<br>

1. Unhide the armors sheet<br>

</div>That's pretty much exactly what I meant - sorry for the confusion.  I'm barely good enough to do the cycle computations for cycles that are sustainable, not saavy enough to do DPS comparisons between them, and am currently trying to see what an optimal cycle for those builds would be.<br>
<br>
If you have a quick "Change Cell ___ to itself * 1.25" fix for updating the .8 sheet, that'd be helpful... though I suppose since Hemo's wasn't normalized when you implemented it, that would have to be changed as well.</div>

		<div id="post_message_547954">Honestly, with any reasonable SS or Hemo build, you can't go too far wrong by doing 5s5r.  If you look at the actual damage difference between that and Xs5r, the real damage difference tends to only be a percent or two, so as a "lazy cycle" it's pretty much universally a good choice.  So even with 4/5 T4, you can always fall back on that if events are being too distracting.  Most combat builds will run it with slack, as will combat hemo with 2/5 T4, and the rest of Hemo builds will just need to trim a rupture every minute or two.</div>

</div>Just as an aside, on our VR gank last night (after our first Vashj kill, woo!) I found myself doing something similar to this with Eviscerates, what with VR being unrupturable.  I'd get S'n'D up, then do 5e, then do the biggest S'n'D I could, then 5e again, etc.  When my S'n'D got up to 5 points, that gave me enough slack to chain together two 5e in a row.<br>
<br>
I guess you'd describe that as ns/5e , with added 5e whenever there was enough slack time.  In practice the "cycle" ended up as something like 1s/5e/2s/5e/3s/5e/4s/5e/5s/5e/5e<br>
<br>
Was this the optimal strategy, or should I have locked myself into something consistent (say 3s/5e)?  It certainly felt like the variable size S'n'D gave me more scope to adjust for procs, and to slot in things like BF and AR as appropriate.</div>

Also, I was using T5~ gear on every piece except my gloves and helm (t4 for the 2pc). I got the t6 gloves last night but not the helm (I'm up for it when it drops arghhh), and the spreadsheet says I should probably just break the t4 2pc since I gain almost 20dps.  I could switch back to my t4 legs from skulkers so I still get the t4 2pc and that actually says I gain like 4-5 dps (probably from having shorter cycles) but it still says skulkers are a 30ap upgrade over t4 :\.

</div>One thing to keep in mind about this is that 363 is the hit cap against level 73s.  The hit caps against levels 70, 71, and 72 are 300, 308, and 316.  Hence, in terms of everyday gear - gear that you're going to be using against trash or against boss adds that may not be level 73 - I would argue that getting above 300 hit is not only nothing special but in a very real sense counterproductive.  As usual, one wants to select the gear that is independently good rather than focusing on achieving any particular hit number, but personally if I found my gear starting to creep significantly above 300 hit I might regem for less hit.<br>
<br>
In terms of hit food: I suspect most combat rogues will find it optimal, but, again, that's why we have spreadsheets.  This is another reason to try to keep some separation from the hit cap; if you have 350 hit initially you can't make use of hit food even on boss fights.<br>
<br>
Distilling this all down to it's key points: I personally am not planning on re-gemming *anything* based on the changed hit cap.  The level at which hit starts to soft-cap (due to hit cap on level 70-72 opponents) has only changed by 15, and against level 73s where you might want a bit more hit than before there is hit food to help close the gap.  Moreover, your *actual* chance of hitting mobs hasn't really changed that much, as Weapon Expertise means that even if your miss rate is a bit higher than before, your dodge rate is a bit lower, so in the net, not a whole lot has changed.<br>

</div>Which brings me to the topic of posts like this.  I'm not trying to pick on anyone in particular; this just happens to be a post on the very topic under discussion on the same page, but this is certainly a philosophy that has appeared any number of times throughout the first 1400 posts in this thread.  So to make the point perfectly clear:<br>
<br>
THE CONCEPT OF "NEEDING TO STACK HIT" IS TOTAL BS.<br>
<br>
There is no circumstance under which one "needs" to stack hit.  As a general rule, items with hit on them are good, yes.  But regardless of your current amount of hit, and regardless of the amount of hit on the items in question, if item A is better than item B, you should use it.<br>
<br>
In this particular case: for most rogues for whom the comparison is relevant, Shadowmaster's are better than Nyn'jah Tabi.  Hence, regardless of your current hit, if you have the choice between them, you should use Shadowmaster, because they're better.  Yes, they have less hit, but THAT DOESN'T MATTER.  There is nothing special about having your hit being more than any particular number.  Using an item that causes you to do less total DPS because you want your hit to be 300 instead of 275 is, frankly, ludicrous.<br>
<br>
Now, I'm not saying that Nyn'jah Tabi aren't good.  They are.  They're great boots, and many rogues are going to use them for a long time.  But to say that they are better than Shadowmaster's purely because they have more hit is just plain wrong.<br>
<br>
With regards to the question of when the next version will come along: I'm still aiming to make my previous estimate of around Thanksgiving.<br>
<br>
I should note, however, that I've started to feel a bit burnt out on the whole "spreadsheet" thing - hence, while I do plan to keep it up-to-date with mechanics changes and whatnot, I'm currently thinking that I probably won't be making significant UI changes as I've talked about in the past.  That is, I will keep the sheet more or less updated and correct, but, barring some significant change in my enthusiasm level for the project, there probably won't be a lot of new features from here on out.</div>

		<div id="post_message_550122">Kudos to Aldriana.<br>
<br>
I have followed this thread to the benefit of my rogue alt, and posts by Aldriana before this thread existed and I am staggered by the amount of work you have put in - not just to make your spreadsheet the best it can be, but to babysit and handhold and explain when people come up and ask something they should be able to figure out themselves.<br>
<br>
I understand the burnout, and my only advice here is: Tend to your burnout before it becomes permanent.<br>
<br>
Burnout is fixable, but you need it to go to a slow burn level for probably at least 2-3 months before new ideas and motivation will surface. Don't let anyone guilt you into putting in more effort at a time when burnout is in play. Make sure you feel that you are taking a break from the work related to the spreadsheet in a meaningful way. <br>
<br>
While I'm a big fan of the spreadsheet and would certainly love to see a version updated for 2.3, I think we all need to step back and take a deep breath and realize that Aldriana will release it when it's ready and the only thing that can be accomplished by pushing for it is adding to burnout and alienation - and wasting his(her?) time responding to posts. As far as I'm concerned if it comes out in a months time it'll be all the more eagerly anticipated for it.<br>
<br>
In the interrim Vulajin's Roguecraft 101 thread is a wealth of information, and for gear selection he's even walking us through how to assess the damage potential of items. If it's really important to you to know which item of two is better - go do some calculations or make some updates to the spreadsheet of your choice. If it's not really important but it'd just be nice to know - wait for the spreadsheet to come out or go look at the dps spreadsheet.</div>

</div>I think the big reason I personally felt they were better off the top was the insane amounts of hit you could get from one item.  There are several items in BT/Hyjal that have 0 hit on them and yet are still amazing pieces.  I personally will be picking them up for the interim of Sharhaz boots, because they are that good and almost a side-grade to the Shadowmaster's according to your spreadsheet.  I agree, don't socket/stack hit like it's going out of style, but to the same degree, you can't go wrong putting hit in a lot of spots.<br>

</div>Def take care of yourself before us.  Having a spreadsheet that is up to date and looking pretty is useful, but if its' at the cost of persons sanity over it, not worth it at all, and we'll survive without a spreadsheet.  I know that now that I'm in BT/Hyjal, I rarely check the spreadsheet anymore because so many of the items are jsut pure upgrades, no matter how you look at it, but again, <br>

</div>Seriously - the sheet as it stands has enough features that it meets its goal.  It's a great resource and it's been very helpful.  Take it easy and don't let funtime get to be worktime too much.<br>
<br>
As for hit stacking - I've just switched to socketing all my red/yellow slots with Glinting.  Hit vs Agility is SO close anyway, I'm not really too bothered with the minutae - they each have their strengths, so hedging towards both sides is my plan.</div>

</div>I'm going to have to agree with this. You've been a great help for me personally with your sheet since it's release Aldriana, your posts on theorycraft and all things Rogue have been a pleasure to read here on EJ. Don't let your hobby like this burn you out or turn you off to keeping working on it. If it's becoming too much, like Shaker said, we'll make do; just take care of your own things and take a break from it. But really, I tip my hat to you as your hours spent and hard-work has most definitely helped me out along the way. You don't hear this enough, in my opinion so: Thanks man. </div>

</div>Well, not to quibble, but: I have actually made proposals of this sort before, and requested that interested parties PM me; to date, I've received exactly 0 PMs offering assistance.  The only independent development I'm aware of (since Darlal stopped working on the sheet, anyway) is Katherine's version with the 2.3 items in it, which, honestly, I probably should have looked over in more detail than I did; it came through while I was busy being sick and, as such, didn't get quite as much attention as it might have deserved.<br>
<br>
I should note that that's totally fine, of course; I'm not trying to guilt anyone into volunteering.  If people don't feel like working on it, that's totally understandable.  I'm not complaining; I'm just making an observation that, for whatever reason, offers of help have not been particularly forthcoming.<br>
<br>
However, it also should be noted that it's actually pretty hard to review changes made by other people.  There's quite a bit of complexity in the sheet, and thousands upon thousands of cells of calculations.  The only way I can even effectively verify my own changes is that I made the changes myself and thus know exactly what I messed with and where, which limits the number of things I have to check.  I always perform certain modifications in the same way, which means that the number of places they can go wrong is limited.  If, on the other hand, changes were made by other people, it's really impossible to know what all they may have made changes to and what implications it may have had.  Fundamentally, if someone else wants to take up development on the sheet, it's going to need to get to a point where there is a person or people whom I can trust to get things more or less right without having to directly verify their changes.  This is, admittedly, somewhat of a tall order, since the sheet is somewhat complicated and I'm not sure *I'd* be able to keep track of everything that was going on had I not written most of it myself.<br>
<br>
And that, fundamentally, is one of the major problems with the sheet.  I do think it's reasonably accurate and has a lot of nice features, but the cost of that is complexity; it takes a lot of time and effort to make even simple changes, which is why there tends to be quite a bit of time between each revision, and possibly the reason why other people, to date, have not been interested in working on it; this sheet is, quite simply, a pain in the you-know-where to update.  It's the unfortunate reality of the situation, and one that can't really be remedied easily without sacrificing functionality or accuracy, neither of which I'm particularly inclined to do.  Or, I should say, it's a limitation of spreadsheets that that's going to be the case; if written in an actual programming language, these effects would be somewhat reduced and it could probably be made more accurate, more functional, and easier to maintain.  This is actually something I've thought about previously (I'm sure you can find repeated references to it in the prior posts within this thread), but the initial overhead of doing so has been, to date, sufficiently high that I haven't felt like working on it (see also: the above comments re: burnout).  If, however, this is a project that people are interested in, and in particular if you're interested and have some coding experience, feel free to send me a PM (or otherwise contact me) and we can talk over the possibilities.<br>
<br>
Anyway, long story short: I am not averse to offers of assistance in terms of maintaining the sheet, but in such a partnership it really would need to work toward a situation in which said maintainer took a certain level of responsibility for updating things with enough attention to detail that I don't need to review every single change, or it doesn't actually help matters much.  This, coupled with the fairly high difficulty of maintaining things in the first place, provides a reasonable basis for why help has not been forthcoming to date, which is, as mentioned, totally understandable.  As always, if you feel up to the challenge I would definitely like to hear from you, but I don't want anyone to feel obligated or pressured into doing so.`</div>

Swing by World of Raids and check out the screenshot of Spinesever, which trades 3 ap and 2 hit for 20 AP and 12 stamina relative to the previous best, Arcanite Steam-Pistol.  By my count that's about an 8 AP upgrade offensively, with an extra 12 stamina to boot.  Not too shabby.</div>

</div>Might be true, but doing it on a §$%&amp;! BoE worlddrop??? It's making me furious when I see every single ranged weapon available in the game for rogues to be dwarfed stats-wise by this thing found in a lockbox.<br>

</div>Afaik there is no iLevel Calculator left that can propperly calculate sacrificed dps into the ilevel (not to say any remotely working ilevel calculator at all). Entering the stats on Spinesever into this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071227195318/http://wow.virakar.com/stats/itemlevel.html" target="_blank">Calculator</a> results in an iLevel of 146 and since the calculated ilevels in most cases are quite some points lower than the in-game-ilevel i would guess that the real ilevel of Spinesever stats-wise is around 151-156. Of cause the dps doesn't fit into that ilevel range. Whereas the dps-range fits perfectly to the in-game-ilevel of the item itself (100) so it's quite possible that there has been made a n error in stats distribution on that thingie.<br>
<br>
/edit: just playing around a little with the Calculator : seems like the +17 agility is cauing the huge stats-increase in ilevel. leave them out and everything else the same and you get an ilevel of around 109.</div>

		<div id="post_message_551545">I was talking to a friend last night and came up with a (crazy, but nevertheless) interesting idea.  So, random crackpot theory time:<br>
<br>
Observation 1: Spinesever has the look of an item designed specifically for rogues.  The stat distribution is exactly what we'd want, and while the dps of it is fairly low, it's relatively slow for a ranged weapon leading to decent-sized Deadly Throws anyway.<br>
<br>
Observation 2: Spinesever appears to be incredibly rare.  After 3 days of patch, only one has been found on any server; now, I haven't actually run the statistics on this, but it seems to me that your average world-drop epic would appear a little more frequently than this when you look at all 300 servers.<br>
<br>
Observation 3: The only known Spinesever was found in a pickpocketed lockbox, that is, from a source that only a rogue has access to, and that most rogues don't actually bother with.<br>
<br>
Random crackpot theory: What if Spinesever *only* drops in pickpocketed lockboxes?  It would explain the scarcity, and it would make a certain amount of sense if a rogue-optimized item came solely from a rogue-specific source, and might even justify the over-budget stats.  I'd be a little surprised if this were the case, if for no other reason than because I would have expected it to be BoP were this true.  But it still strikes me as an interesting idea, so I figured I'd share and see what other people thought.</div>

		<div id="post_message_551587">So it for sure came from a "Strong Lockbox" pp'd from the terrormasters? If that's the case, and I've only gotten 2-3 greens a week when I'm full out farming, that would make this item the rarest item in the game.<br>
<br>
Also, That is kind of a crackpot theory, but it almost works.  Sadly, I doubt seriously that blizzard is this incredibly smart when it comes to itemization for, of all the classes, rogues. :\<br>
<br>
<br>
BTW, I've been pp-macro'ing those locks/terrormasters at legion hold for 3 days straight, if i get that, I'll probably actually sell, since I have an arcanite-steam pistol.  4-5k gold is well worth it imo, then again, I might keep, who knows.. :\</div>

		<div id="post_message_551651">I am the one who found it so I wanted to comment and set things straight.<br>
<br>
To start off, Surma was my main as I raided extensively pre-TBC.  After TBC I took some time off from raiding and never got back into it, so I switched to Merbale for PvP fun.<br>
<br>
On 11/14 around 10:30-11am CST I found the item while grinding on 'Surma' near the Terrormasters in SMV.  I use the popular PP and cheap shot macro.  I looted 10 junk boxes during my 10-15 minute grind session.  After I was done grinding, I started to open all the junk boxes hoping for healing potions.  I was mindlessly opening them and looted the Spinesever.<br>
<br>
In a year and a half of using the PP/CS macro all I had previously received from junkboxes was ONE green item.<br>
<br>
This is a nice website.  I've been lurking for quite some time.<br>
<br>
I want to sell this thing, the amount of whispers and in game mails I've received is unbelievable.</div>

</div>My theory is like yours.   I believe since blinding powder has been essentially removed from the game, this is an item specifically placed only in junk boxes as an incentive for rogues to use the pick pocket ability.<br>
<br>
I do not think the item will be nerfed or modified.  Spinesever is the best BoE to ever drop so I think Blizzard has a plan behind it.  If they overlooked something it would be a huge mistake on their part.  Of course, everything is speculation at this point.</div>

I do not think the item will be nerfed or modified.  Spinesever is the best BoE to ever drop so I think Blizzard has a plan behind it.  If they overlooked something it would be a huge mistake on their part.  Of course, everything is speculation at this point.</div>

</div>VERY VERY VERY good to know. <br>
<br>
And it sort of does support your friend and your own "crackpot" theory.  I've yet to every hear of a blue coming from a junkbox, mainly just a green every year or so.  And the number of rogues that potentially pp-cs macro mobs while farming, especially at legion hold is astounding, so I'd expect to see every rogue using that macro and going at it. Like it's been said before, the coincidence that a brand new (3 days old) BoE epic thrown weapon itemized perfect for rogues would come from a pick pocketable item is insane.  I hope it holds true, I pickpocket the crap outta stuff when I farm.<br>
<br>
<br>
On that note, is there anyway to put like a 1 second delay after the PP so that even with lag, you still can loot the items with auto-loot?  I have around 150ms on my new server and noticed that sometimes I see more than 1 item in the loot screen but only seem to loot 1 thing.  Maybe it's my eyes playing tricks, but I'm guessing that the lag is causing me to miss some of it.</div>

</div>The basic idea behind any rotation is to keep Slice and Dice up 100% of the time while doing the maximum possible Rupture damage. The reason why you'd use any Xs/Yr rotation is that for your spec and gear, it optimally accomplishes both these goals.<br>
<br>
That said, it depends what type of build exactly you're talking about. <br>
<br>
As Combat Swords, 1s/5r is usually the norm with 2-piece Tier 4 (although it varies based on how much hit/haste you have for Combat Potency procs). Once you lose 2-piece Tier 4 the sheet will usually recommend 3.Xs/5r. As Aldriana put it so well in the first post of the thread, this means you can either "weave" 3 and 4 point Slice and Dices, or you can just do the next highest SnD, which will usually be 4. Of course you'd have to check the sheet with your specific gear and build put in.<br>
<br>
As Hemo, combo point generation is a bit slower due to the lack of Combat Potency (even though Hemo only costs 35 energy). Therefore you'd want to a 5s/5r; however, you'd have to do one 4-point Rupture every so often because 5s/5r with this build is not hypothetically sustainable, and you also need to have the energy to use Blade Flurry.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">A question about 5s/5r cycles.  I'm a sword rogue and I've always heard of using 1s/5r or 2s/5r if you don't have 2/T4.  Is 5s/5r for sword rogue?  If so, can someone explain why you would want to wait and use 3 more CPs for a SnD?</div>

</div>So, the reason one specifically doesn't use 1s5r or 2s5r as a sword rogue without 2/5 T4 is because you won't be able to keep up 100% SnD uptime, and that is, shall we say, very very bad, on the whole.  Hence, you need to use a cycle long enough to keep SnD up; for most of us, that's either 3s5r or 4s5r.<br>
<br>
Now, the next question is, why would one use 5s5r over one of those?  Well, there's a couple answers to that question, all of which can reasonably be argued to be valid:<br>
<br>
1) You shouldn't, 4s5r (or 3s5r, or whatever) is better.<br>
2) Because 5s5r only deals trivially less damage (like, .2% or something), and some people find it easier to maintain, it's potentially worth using if you have responsibilities in a raid beyond optimizing your DPS.<br>
3) 5s5r has more slack in it; if your cycle gets disrupted for any reason (Kaz'rogal War Stops you, Naj'entus throws up a shield causing you to pause DPS for a few seconds, Kael starts casting something that you need to kick, Magtheridon bounces you around, or even just simple bad luck on procs) 5s5r is less likely to drop SnD uptime due to the disruption than 4s5r or 3s5r.<br>
4) What 5s5r fundamentally does relative to more compressed cycles is sacrifice some finisher damage for extra SS damage.  5s5r spends 0 net energy on finishers; a cycle like 3s5r on average spends 10 energy on finishers, which is 10 energy not being spend on Sinister Strikes.  For most rogues, this tradeoff is worth it; however, at very high itemization levels, it's possible to get enough AP/Crit/Armor Penetration that the Sinister Strikes actually do more damage, such that 5s5r will actually do more damage.<br>
<br>
And lastly, something I've been playing around with lately:<br>
5) If you have Ashtongue Talisman of Lethality, the slack energy of 5s5r allows you to manipulate your cycles a little more than you can with a tighter cycle; you can, for instance, wait a few seconds after building up 5 combo points to let your energy tick up to ~60 before launching the next finisher; this allows more Sinister Strikes to be launched while the Ashtongue buff is up.  Such manipulations are somewhat harder (though, admittedly, not totally impossible) with a tighter cycle.</div>

</div>I've actually been playing around with this myself as well, albeit going from a tight 3s/5r to 4s/5r.  I haven't recorded any hard numbers, but my gut is that it is a significant increase.  Not only from it being able to stack up a pool of energy to be burst out after finisher, but also due to getting an extra 20% for the buff.  I'm considering moving up to a 5s/5r cycle for that reason, since it would give me a 100% chance for the buff, and I could get more SS's off while covered by it.

</div>I can confirm that this is possible with a 1s/5r rotation though certainly not on every cycle.  The cases where I have mostly been able to pull this "energy burst" off is typically when I cannot overwrite a rupture but still have some SnD time to spare.  Since I have the Ashtongue trinket, I thought it better to save some energy while the last seconds of rupture tick off, refresh it (getting the trinket buff), renew my SnD, and launch some nasty sinister strike crits.  Sadly, I finally broke my 2 piece-T4 bonus this week for T6 and will have to experiment with a longer cycle.<br>
<br>
One question, though: is it also worth switching to 5s/5r, if you have the Ashtongue trinket, as to guarantee the buff after each SnD?  Will the dps gained by increased trinket uptime outweigh the dps lost by less rupture uptime?</div>

		<div id="post_message_552867">Going from, say, 3s5r to 5s5r doesn't actually increase your Ashtongue uptime significantly; yes, you will get an Ashtongue proc on every SnD instead of only 60% of them; but your cycle is somewhat longer as well.  Hence, neglecting any energy-queuing effects like the one discussed, the uptime works out to be very very close to the same.  Hence, the only advantage of going to 5s5r is the greater ability to manipulate the cycle, which isn't modeled in the sheet (and probably never will be).</div>

</div>From a theoretical perspective, I don't see how 2s5r would be sustainable without 2/5 T4; consider:<br>
<br>
A 2-point SnD with 3/3 Imp SnD lasts 17.4 seconds.<br>
<br>
2s5r with 3/3 Ruthlessness requires, on average, 5.8 (7-2*.6) Sinister strikes to maintain; Assuming SS is never dodged, this requires, on average, 40*5.8 = 232 energy.  Additionally, it requires an average of 15 energy to perform a 2-pt SnD.  Hence, 247 energy is required per cycle.<br>
<br>
Hence, to be sustainable, this requires that your energy regent exceed 247 per 17.4 seconds, or roughly 14.2 energy per second.<br>
<br>
Natural regen is 10 energy per second; hence you need to generate 4.2 energy per second from other sources; ignoring Rod of the Sun King for the moment, the only real source for this is Combat Potency.<br>
<br>
Combat Potency generates an average of 3 energy per hit; hence you need to average 1.4 OH hits per second.  Even assuming that you are both hit and expertise capped, this still requires 1.4 attacks per second, or an average weapon speed of .71.<br>
<br>
With the fastest possible OH (1.3) and 2/5 T6 on the SnD, even assuming 100% uptime on both mongoose enchants (unlikely), this still requires that one drop one's attack speed from .93 to .71 with haste effects; this requires an average of 467 haste rating - which I'm reasonably certain isn't possible.<br>
<br>
Now, in short term situations - like, if you're getting chain-heroismed - this is possible.  But in terms of a steady cycle that you can sustain without such internal factors?  I'm not seeing it.</div>

</div>Good point, I'll try and notice that.  And, its' entirely possible that I'm not noticing drop offs in SnD/Rupture when they actually ARE happening, but I'll se tuesday, we do a full hyjal and 3/9 BT clear, so that should give me plenty of fights to notice and keep track on.  <br>
<br>
I wasn't pointing this out to find flaw the the sheets, btw.  Rather, I was worried that I am either a)Screwing myself over without even knowing it, since this is 100% impossible, or the other option of b) I found some odd set of circumstances where I am able to do what I'm doing and it's possible for others to do it as well.  We'll see after tuesday..<br>
<br>
<br>
Also, wondering if anyone has heard of a spinesever coming from lockboxes from other places than heroics/SMV. I know that reasonably, the boxes from any 61+ mob would work, but with so few spinesevers out, hard to really put a nail on any definite answers.  I was working the ogre's at Burning Blade just because I can two shot them, little reistance from opposing faction and seem to have a little better lockbox rate than anything I've found in SMV, but I don't want to waste my time if no one has gotten one from anything lower than 67+ mobs... :\</div>

From personal experience 2s/5r is doable if you have 2 T6, before I got my 2nd piece it was almost impossible to keep up a 2 point SnD rotation. <br>
It's by no means a perfect rotation, meaning that without "lucky" procs from DST, Mongoose and my other friendly fellow rogues are slacking on Drums rupture will run out, but then I have some extra combo's for SnD meaning I have more slack in the next rotations.<br>

<br>
1. In a real world situation, switching from 3.x s/5r to 5s/5r amounts to a trivial amount of DPS lost.<br>
2. In the model used in the spreadsheet, the 2pc T4 bonus is worth a substantial amount of AP (about 60 for me.)<br>
<br>
If going from 3 sinister strikes to 5 isn't much of a loss, why is going from 3 sinister strikes to 1 a "noticeable" gain?</div>

		<div id="post_message_555554">A couple reasons:<br>
<br>
1) The difference between 1 and 3 is larger than the difference between 3 and 5.<br>
2) The difference between 5s5r and Xs5r tends to be smaller at higher itemization levels; most of the people here who are talking about Ashtongue Talisman cycles and the like tend to have T5-T6 level gear, and thus gain less benefit from Xs5r than someone at a T4 level of gear.<br>
3) Even a "significant" difference can make a surprisingly small DPS difference.<br>
<br>
An illustrative example: you refer to 2/5 T4 being about 60 AP for you.  In my current gear (T5-T6 level gear), it scores only 15 AP.  At a somewhat lower level of gear - say, the default gear in the 0.8 sheet - it's worth about 42 AP.  Notice how as gear improves, the value of the benefit decreases.<br>
<br>
Next, with the default gear, how much difference does that 40 AP actually make?  Well, my listed DPS for 5s5r is 1480.49; with the 2/5 T4 bonus but otherwise identical stats, 1s5r would do 1499.44; hence, that 40 AP increase works out to about 19 actual DPS, or about 1.3%.  So even a reasonably larger (say, 40 AP) bonus converts to little more than 1% change in real DPS.  The differences we're talking aren't as large as one might think.<br>
<br>
Thirdly, Xs5r (which recommends 3.4s5r) with my base gear comes out to 1486.91; notice that the damage difference between 1 and 3.4 is almost twice the damage difference from 3.4 to 5.  So there's a bit of nonlinearity here as well.<br>
<br>
So, with T5/early T6 gear, the difference between Xs5r and 5s5r is about 6 DPS, or .4%.  I think it's fair to say that this is a "reasonably small difference".  However, with the lower gear levels where 2/5 T4 tends to be more relevant, the difference between 1s5r can still be fairly significant (60 AP, as you say) despite this fact.</div>

</div>I have no possible ability to answer that question, since it sounds like a bug with the way one or both items were entered, and since neither is in the last version of the sheet I released, I couldn't tell you which it is.  When I get around to releasing the next version, if it's still a problem, I will look into it.  But short of that, you're pretty much on your own.</div>

</div>I have been studying the spreadsheet for the past few weeks, trying to learn the insides and outs to make my own changes for hemo/shadowstep/executioner/Items, etc for my own personal use.  <br>
<br>
I came across this error when I was comparing the Deathmantle Helm to the ZA helm.  What's happening is even though you have selected the ZA helm that has no meta socket in it, it is still using the Meta Gem from the previous selection(i.e. RED).<br>
<br>
To fix this, simply change the formula that is in cell F10 on the Talents_Equipment sheet from =IF(VLOOKUP(HelmEQ,ArmorStats,32,FALSE)&gt;0,1,0) to =IF(VLOOKUP(HelmEQ,ArmorStats,31,FALSE)&gt;0,1,0)<br>
<br>
Hope that helps.<br>

The correct way of adding imp windfury is unclicking wf and activating imp windfury right? if you leave both clicked you get a huge dps boost (140dps ???) that doesnt seem possible for a 200'ish ap increase to the extra attacks.

		<div id="post_message_558042">Hey Aldriana, thanks, as always for all the hard work.  Just to back up some of the previous posters, if you decided to keep the sheet the same and update it as necessary with gear and other patch note changes, you would still be doing the rogue community a huge favor! <br>
<br>
One very small suggestion: perhaps you could as a brief descriptor after the version number informing people what the current version is up to in terms of wow patch notes.<br>
<br>
Currently it is:<br>
<br>
Version 0.8, 10/12/07:<br>
<br>
My suggestion would be:<br>
<br>
Version 0.8, 10/12/07, Current as of: Patch 2.2:<br>
<br>
Or for the next one you put out:<br>
<br>
Version 0.9, 11/??/07, Current as of: Patch 2.3, New ZA and Badge Gear<br>
<br>
Obviously this isn't totally necessary, but I do see people asking questions about what is currently included and this might help cut those down.  It might also just make things a little more clear in general, instead of replying on just the date and trying to remember when that last patch actually came out  <br>
<br>
Thanks again for all your work.</div>

</div>I think I object to the description of Shadowpanther as "very trusted".  I think a more accurate term would be, perhaps, "widely used".  In terms of accuracy, it's certainly better than some sources out there, but it can't really be considered a highly trusted source.  As a quick reference guide it does fine, but in pretty much any circumstance when it differs from information on these forums, we're right and it's wrong.<br>
<br>
One could, then, reasonably ask "why is it so widely used if it's not notably accurate?"  Well, first, as a quick approximation when your gear is changing reasonably often and you don't feel like messing with a spreadsheet, it does fine - in that case, it does have it's place.  Additionally, even were that not the case, there's certainly plenty of examples of widely trusted but vastly incorrect information out there.  I can't tell you how many times I've been asked the question "if theorycraft says X, why does so-and-so from Nihilum do Y instead?" - to which the answer is, quite simply: because we're right and he's wrong.  Or, as another example: back in the day, Ming had a nontrivial following in terms of rogue advice and strategy; however, 5 minutes examination of his derivation of an AEP system revealed that the fact that his recommendations were even close to right was more a matter of coincidence than any actual merit.<br>
<br>
Anyway: I'm not saying that people shouldn't use Shadowpanther.  I just encourage them to remember that it's only a rough estimate of the right answers, so people shouldn't be surprised when it disagrees with the more detailed examinations of the subject.</div>

		<div id="post_message_561662">WHile it's hard to add much to what Ald posted regarding Shadowpanther and Nihilum, it's true. Nihilum has exceptionally good WoW players and so they kill bosses faster than other people. If their first few guides are any indiciation, however, they have many bad theorycrafters who are simply wrong.<br>
<br>
Because Nihilum achieves great things in WoW with their great players, they have many people emulate what they say is correct -- even when it isn't.<br>
<br>
Playing well is going to improve your rogue dps with inferior gear more than getting better gear will -- unless you are skill capped. <br>
<br>
I refer to Shadowpanther now and again for lists of items and such, but it's fairly easy to see how incorrect the information is. If you can find two items you own that are rated in different order by the rogue gear spreadsheet here and the shadowpanther list, go test them out in blasted lands and in a few raids. What you'll see is not only does the theorycraft back up the spreadsheets here over shadowpanther, but the reality does too.</div>

		<div id="post_message_562065">Rather than diss the Shadowpanther information (which I used for many, many months to help guide me in my gear selection up through T3), I'll point out that his rating system basically assigns static AEP values to each stat, then just does some simple math to total everything up.  Then he provides three different sets of static weightings to approximate the benefits you might be getting playing three different playstyles.<br>
<br>
The spreadsheets listed here, on the other hand, go to varying lengths to model the interaction between different stats and to <i>calculate</i> the relative "AEP" stats you should be using.  They also, to different degrees, model cycles and other complex processes to better estimate true effect on your in-game DPS generation.<br>
<br>
Nobody says the models are perfect, and a bad model might end up being less predictive than shadowpanther.  Luckily, through lots of empirical testing and multiple eyeballs looking over the calculations, we're pretty certain the two sheets here are not "bad", and are hopefully pretty "good."<br>
<br>
Summary: Trust the sheets here more than the shadowpanther estimates.  But for people unwilling or unable to use and understand these sheets, shadowpanther is likely to be better than nothing.  I certainly support him in his effort to help the community.</div>

		<div id="post_message_562094">Don't get me wrong: I don't think there's anything fundamentally wrong with his techniques; he scores stuff via equivalence points just like everyone else.  It's just that the weightings there are a bit off for most people, such that the gear ordering, while decent, does have some places where I think the order is wrong.  Is it better than nothing?  Sure.  As I said above, for those who don't want to spend the time on sheets, it's a perfectly reasonably place to be looking.  But on the other hand, it does need to be remembered that it's not as accurate as some of the other sources available, which is why the question "Why does the spreadsheet say X while Shadowpanther says Y" is not the most productive of questions.</div>

		<div id="post_message_562204">"I think I object to the description of Shadowpanther as "very trusted". I think a more accurate term would be, perhaps, "widely used". In terms of accuracy, it's certainly better than some sources out there, but it can't really be considered a highly trusted source. As a quick reference guide it does fine, but in pretty much any circumstance when it differs from information on these forums, we're right and it's wrong."<br>
<br>
I agree with Aldriana, shadowpanther isnt nearly as indepth as most of the information on this site. Anything you see there should be taken with a grain of salt and not gospel. <br>
<br>
If your guild has Illidan on farm status, im pretty sure your main source for information at that level of play comes from here.<br>
<br>
I use shadowpanther alot for general information dont get me wrong, but when you are searching for the theory behind the damage you do and/or trying to eek out 1 or 2 more dps from your already nearly maxed gear, here is where you will find the tools and information to do that, imo.</div>

I'm sitting at 314 hit as of now, (I picked up the slayer's helm last night and added a 10hit gem to my gloves since we dont have the shifting shadowsong pattern yet :\).  I know that trying to hitcap directly is pointless, but at the same time, having DST/WSC as my trinkets (both chance on hits, thus higher chance to proc with more hits), I would assume that adding hit isn't a bad thing.  <br>
<br>
My bamboozlement came from adding Mantle of Darkness and noticiing a DROP in dps over Swiftstrike shoulders.  Compared, swiftstrike has 104~ap, .72%crit and 2.4% haste while mantle has 22 hit, 94ap and 1.49% crit.  I guess I'm just amazed that 10ap and 2.4% haste &gt; 22hit and +.77% crit.  Even with kings, it only adds 3ap and .075% crit, not really adding to swiftstrike that much.  This isn't really a HUGE issue since I won't have anyone going against me for the shoulders, but at the same time, why waste dkp on them if they aren't a true upgrade?</div>

		<div id="post_message_562243">Well, making the extraordinarily unscientific approximate that 1% hit, 1% crit, and 1% haste help one by roughly comparable amounts (which isn't precisely true, but as they're within 10% or so of each other it's close enough as to be illustrative):  22 hit is 1.40% hit, so 22 hit and .77 crit works out to about 2.2% benefit, versus 2.4% (from haste) and 10 AP.  It certainly seems reasonable to me that the latter is better.<br>
<br>
Fundamentally: hit gives you more white damage and more procs.  Crit gives you more white and yellow damage.  Haste gives you more white damage and more combat potency procs.  All three are thus good, and, in equal percentage quantity, are in the same ballpark of quality.  The reason why hit and haste are better than crit in practice is because it takes fewer points of them to make 1% benefit.<br>
<br>
So, stated briefly: this is a classic case of "hit is good, but there are other stats which are also good, so one has to look at the tradeoffs".  And in this case, both ballpark estimates and the detailed analysis of the spreadsheet seem to agree that Swiftstrike is better.</div>

</div>1) I did some testing on the PTR and concluded that the difference between an additive combination of the two and a multiplicative combination is so miniscule, it'll be essentially impossible to determine which is the case under any real conditions. For simplicity, I modeled it as additive.<br>
2) All of those talents stack additively.<br>
3) I was asked in a PM recently to substantiate the 6.5% figure, and I really couldn't come up with much. There was a post late in the "weapon skill adjustment discussion" thread that contained parses which seemed to indicate dodge rates higher than 5.6% for bosses, but it's certainly nothing conclusive.<br>
4) Just use 10%. It is far more likely you'll be at or near 100% when you use the ability, and I'm very willing to bet that any troll rogue who bides his time waiting to take damage before popping Berserking will have inferior results to one who uses the ability on cooldown regardless of health.</div>

</div>They are additive (1+.06+.2+.1).  It's not that hard to determine.  You hit something with a low-range weapon, like a 2-4 damage sword or a 1-3 range dagger at a set AP.  If you are hitting level 1 Young Ragged Wolves where crit kicks do 220, do the math, it's additive.  Then again I was the one who came up with a way to determine if Weapon Skill was rounded or floored.  Just need to set strict test conditions.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I'm not really confidant in it's accuracy but, I've noticed about a 1% dodge rate vs. Boss level mobs for myself with 21 Expertise when looking over the past few weeks WWS reports. (5 from Human Racial, 10 from Talents, 6 from the Vashj belt) Which would put a boss at 6.25% Dodge from just the few boss reports recently. This is close enough to 6.5% that like you said, it looks plausible.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_563105"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->While raiding last night I glanced down and moused over my Hemo tooltip and it said that hemo was applying 132% weapon damage along with the debuff.  I was like, "when did they buff Hemo because I remember it was just a 125% bonus".  Then it hit me, ohhh yea, 4pc T6 bonus.  So I got curious and decided to check what the effect it had on the other abilites was.  Backstab tooltip says 150% weapon damage normally, but with 4pc on, it said 159% weapon damage.  Interesting I thought..  SS tooltip normally says 98 damage + weapon damage, but with 4pc on, it said 103-104 bonus damage.  So that led me to another question, <b>is the spreadsheet modeling the 4pc bonus in the way that blizzard is modeling it?</b>  It looks like blizzard is just adding 6% to whatever the base bonus the ability already has.  The way I thought it would work would be that it would add 6% to your RNG roll for damage done, like if you Hemo'd normally for 2000 on a mob, then with the 4pc bonus, you would hit said mob for 2120.  But with how Blizzard has modeled it, it seems like Backstab is receiving the most benefit from the set bonus and SS is getting the shaft.  I was unable to test what it would have said for mutilate.  I find it odd that Blizzard modeled it this way, but that could just be me.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>So, couple of points here:<br>
<br>
1) The increase in procs from additional crit is reasonably minimal.  With a 45 second cooldown on the effect, the difference between a 25% crit rate and a 30% crit rate is only about 5% uptime, and thus a reasonably small number of AP.<br>
<br>
2) Increasing the amount of crit you have will decrease the relative value of additional crit, which will lower the value of the trinket somewhat.<br>
<br>
Hence, it's at least plausible to me that such a thing as you describe might happen.  However, since it does sound a bit odd, I will look into it over the weekend while I'm working on the sheet.<br>

Is there a way to test that?  According to the previous poster, he's noticing the change is being implemented on the tooltip, thus giving question to if it's being added before or after other modifiers.  It seems sound logic that "increases dmg of ___ by 6%" would be before other modifiers...but maybe I'm wrong.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_563345"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I think the concern came from whether or not the addition of 6% more dmg came to just the SS/BS/Hemo itself, or was multiplied by the total outcome of dmg, which I guess (Haven't had math in a while) doesn't matter if they are all multiplicative.  <br>
<br>
I guess the faulty logic some of us are using was that if you added 6% dmg to just the 98 dmg, you got 103-104, which would be like adding +7 striking on your weapon, while if you added that 6% later, when the ss/bs/hemo hit for 2500, you'd get 2650, which would seem, on top, as more dmg.

</div>I just want to have it on record that this statement is HORRIBLY inaccurate.  2pc T4 is very strong for any build that's realistically being discussed in the endgame PVE scene.  The statements above are very correct, it's hard to find a gearset that is stronger than 2pc T4 until you're at 4pc T5.<br>
<br>
The sheet also does not use the values of the set bonuses in the specific upgrade columns - you need to look at the DPS estimate to see if you're losing DPS by breaking a set bonus.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>To be honest, it should be quite clear.  <br>
<br>
Combat dagger cycles are usually 3s/5s/5r or 3s/3.4r or some variation.  A combat sword cycle is usually 3s/5r and easily maintainable.  A dagger rogue cycle, on the other hand, takes a lot longer to complete and maintain, thus getting rid of an extra SnD combo point would make it a more maintainable cycle.  (When not using 2pc T4).<br>

</div>Actually, plugging my gear into the spreadsheet, then switching to an appropriate dagger spec (and using S2 daggers as compared to my S2 swords), I get the following values:<br>
<br>
To drop the 2pc bonus, I switched my NB gloves to Grips of Deftness<br>
<br>
~1423.63 (swords, w/ 2pc T4)<br>
~1413.78 (swords w/o 2pc T4)<br>
Value of Set bonus in the "Set Bonus Values" sheet - ~46.0<br>
<br>
~1348.45 (daggers w/ 2pc T4)<br>
~1344.1 (daggers w/o 2pc T4)<br>
Value of Set bonus in the "Set Bonus Values" sheet - ~29.6<br>
<br>
So no, it is NOT clear that it is better for combat daggers - in fact, it is QUITE clear to me that it is almost twice as good for combat swords.<br>
<br>
The reason this is true is because the 2pc T4 adds a *static* 3s duration bonus to any SnD.  Sword's tighter cycles utilize this in two ways - #1, they're faster cycles, so you get that 3s duration bonus more often.  Also, they use smaller SnDs, so you get much bigger percentage increase. A 1pt SnD gives 4seconds bonus (from ~13s to ~17s), a 30% increase.  A 5 pt SnD gives about 4.4 seconds (from 30.4 to 34.8), which is only a 15% increase.<br>

</div>Unless this has been changed, I specifically remember Aldrianna saying that the sheet does NOT take into account set bonus when recommending specific item changes.  I believe that he said it was for two reasons, one, it would be difficult to model.  Two, it wouldn't be very accurate for gear recommendations because when it comes down to it, no piece of gear, on its own, would be worth breaking a set bonus as good as 2 peice T4 or 4 peice T5 etc.  I believe that the idea is to collect two or three peices and then it will probably be worth swtiching over all at once.  This is not something that the spreedsheet can do with gear recommendations though.  You have to get the upgrades and then play around with the sheet and see when the individual upgrades that you have outweigh the value of a set bonus.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_565510"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I'm not going to say what 1s5r isn't a better cycle than 1s3r, but in what possible way does 1s3r "waste energy"?  And I'd also point out that 1s3r daggers gets better rupture uptime than 3s5r swords, so I'm not sure I buy the "doesn't get good uptime" argument either.<br>
<br>
Fundamentally, the reason why some people advocate that 2/5 T4 is better for daggers is that it allows you to shift from a long, clunky, annoying cycle like 3s5s5r to a very short, compact cycle like 1s3r, with all the advantages of the shorter cycle and better DPS.<br>
<br>
Now, trimming from 3.Xs5r to 1s5r certainly increases your DPS as well, but it doesn't have the fundamental effect of getting you out of a bad cycle into a good one like it does for daggers, which is why some people say it's a bigger deal for dagger rogues.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_565532"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->One could make the same argument about the 1s5r cycle; a 1 point SnD costs more energy than a 5pt SnD.  It's not a matter of "wasting" energy, it's a matter of spending it on something different.  Fundamentally, what all compressed cycles do is trade SS/BS damage for finisher damage, and at most gear levels that's a worthwhile trade - although, at very high levels of gear, the fact that SS scales faster than Rupture means that you will reach a point where it's *not* a good tradeoff, and 5s5r passes 1s5r on damage output.  Until you get to that point, however, describing "spending energy on a more damage-to-energy efficient move" as "wasting" energy is a bit misleading.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

However, regardless of the specifics, I can safely say that this seems like a "nice-to-have" UI change, meaning that, like most of the other nice-to-have features, it's unlikely to find it's way into the spreadsheet anytime soon, as I'm more or less only doing the bare essentials now.

</div>Um... maybe.  As it's pretty easy to add it's a possibility; on the other hand since A) it doesn't change item valuations in any way shape or form, and B) Ret pallies are reasonably uncommon, it strikes me as not exactly the highest priority there is.  All it would really mean is that the 5% of us that raid with a Ret Pally would have an accurate value for "Total DPS"... which, since this never was intended to be an accurate DPS sheet, strikes me as somewhat low in the priority list.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I think I object to the description of Shadowpanther as "very trusted".  I think a more accurate term would be, perhaps, "widely used".

</div>I like to think my site is "very trusted" by the many people who use it.  While I never claim that my charts are perfect, I think they're good enough for use by the majority of Rogue players out there.  However, since my charts are mostly static (aside from the customizable XLS versions I provide), they don't factor in talent specs, attack rotations, relative increases in gear, etc.  If people are looking for that sort of precision to the nth degree, then I usually send them your way.<br>
<br>
Believe me, Aldriana, I respect all of the hard work you and the army of theorycrafters here at EJ do, but at the same time I can see the toll it takes on you and the developers of the Rogue Spreadsheet.  Few people will ever truly know how much time and effort we put into creating and maintaining our respective gear spreadsheets with the endless release of patches and expansions that bring along hundreds of new/updated items and changes to game mechanics.<br>
<br>
Since my site offers more than just a Maximum Raid DPS Armor chart (PVP charts, Weapons charts, Starter Gear charts, Rogue Twinking/Leveling charts, Resistance Gear charts, Consumables charts, etc.) and I'm just one person, I can only do so much.  So I gladly sacrifice complexity for simplicity and ease of use.<br>
<br>
I fully understand that the charts and information on my site can only take Rogues so far.  When a Rogue has "graduated" from the basic and intermediate level information, and goes out seeking more advanced knowledge, they inevitably end up here at EJ.  And I'm fine with that.  Each site serves a different purpose and I think Rogues are better for it.<br>

The one criticism I want to be clear on is that you order things top to bottom, for instance, as PVE armor.

It doesn't mean your site is bad or useless. Quite the contrary. Your site is helpful and nicely put together and often very up to date and well maintained.

</div>Thanks for the response.  To address your point, I think what happens is that people sometimes get confused and use my general purpose <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080925172915/http://shadowpanther.net/armor-dps.htm" target="_blank">PVE chart</a> instead of my <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080925172915/http://shadowpanther.net/armor-max.htm" target="_blank">Maximum DPS chart</a> when comparing gear for raid DPS.  Like the person in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080925172915/http://elitistjerks.com/561479-post1484.html" target="_blank">Post #1484</a> who thought Brooch of Deftness was ranked as one of the best raiding necks, but was in fact looking at the wrong chart.  I think you'll find that the rankings in my Maximum DPS Chart fall pretty much in line with the results you'll get from the more precise Gear/DPS spreadsheets around here.  There are always going to be minor inconsistencies, but I've been constantly tweaking my chart to correct those issues.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Thanks for the response.  To address your point, I think what happens is that people sometimes get confused and use my general purpose <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080925172915/http://shadowpanther.net/armor-dps.htm" target="_blank">PVE chart</a> instead of my <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080925172915/http://shadowpanther.net/armor-max.htm" target="_blank">Maximum DPS chart</a> when comparing gear for raid DPS.  Like the person in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080925172915/http://elitistjerks.com/561479-post1484.html" target="_blank">Post #1484</a> who thought Brooch of Deftness was ranked as one of the best raiding necks, but was in fact looking at the wrong chart.  I think you'll find that the rankings in my Maximum DPS Chart fall pretty much in line with the results you'll get from the more precise Gear/DPS spreadsheets around here.  There are always going to be minor inconsistencies, but I've been constantly tweaking my chart to correct those issues.<br>
<br>
I'm well aware of this effect, and believe me, it goes both ways.  I frequently get email from people asking why certain items on my charts are ranked differently than they are on the Gear/DPS spreadsheets.  However, I don't have the luxury of responding with "I'm right and they're wrong" because that usually won't be the case.

		<div id="post_message_570197"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->There are people arguing (in the hemo thread) about the accuracy of the modeled value of Dirty Deeds in the spreadsheet.  Some are arguing that:<br>
<br>
1)  due to talents of other classes that improve damage when a mob is below a certain health level, that the boss does not spend as much time below 35% as above it, so 35% * DD talent points * 10% overvalues the impact of dirty deeds<br>
<br>
Others are arguing that:<br>
<br>
2) due to deaths of other raid members that take place during any boss fight, mobs spend more than 35% of their time alive at under 35% health and therefore dirty deeds is undervalued by the spreadsheet<br>
<br>
See posts on topic beginning <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080925172915/http://elitistjerks.com/f31/t14321-rogue_combat_vs_hemo_point_inflection/p56/" target="_blank">here</a>.  My guild data is from SSC/the Eye.  If anyone has data from BT/Hyjal they can analyze, that would be helpful.  <br>
<br>
The question is for each boss, on average, what percentage of the fight time does the boss spend above and below 35% health?<br>
<br>
I expect that the current formula is a reasonable average estimate, but I see why it might be above or below (though arguments for both sides might actually result is an average of 35%).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_570210"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Well, my first answer would be "Dirty Deeds isn't modeled by this spreadsheet at all yet".<br>
<br>
Now, in terms of adding it: I was planning to add it assuming 35% uptime.  It's probably not perfectly accurate, but it should be kept in mind that the damage output of the raid doesn't honestly increase by *that* much after 35%.  I mean, 1/3 of your DPS classes do an extra, what, 10% damage?  20%?  I mean, it goes faster, to be sure, but it's not like the last 35% only takes 20% of the time.  Regardless of which effect you favor, I'm willing to bet that the time spent below 35% is probably between 30% and 40% of the total kill time; hence 35% is probably a pretty good estimate, so, barring significant evidence to the contrary, that's probably what I'll go with.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_570536"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Ariashley, my point in the other thread is that while (1) is absolutely true (2) may well be true and regardless, math is not the most important thing here. For Aldriana's model, a mathematically plug in of 35% (or 30, or 40) is fine because it's a solid approximately. A rogue that rejects or choose that particular talent solely based on the few dps it shows he or she outputting one way or the other is very likely undervaluing said talent.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Two pages back this question was answered, as it has been numerous times before. The author is working on updating the spreadsheet and undoubtedly will notify the rogue community when it is ready for public consumption. Your best bet is to check the first post of this thread for an edit update. There was a modification made by another user of this spreadsheet to include some, but not all, of the new to 2.3 items (this version was never certified by Aldriana, the author of the spreadsheet, so use at your own risk). You'll need to dig around a bit to locate the post, as I don't have it handy.<br>

I'll wait till you release new version and thank jesus you exist :-)  I think I remember you saying the nerfed proc was worth about 200 ap.  I just added 200 passive AP to the MH and it showed about 75 dps increase, no idea if thats remotely accurate or not :-p<br>
<br>
Long story short, thanks again for what you do.</div>

</div>The quick hack approximation I'd use for Warglaives would be to estimate that it procs about once a minute and gives 450 haste rating for 10 seconds; hence, it should be roughly equivalent to 1/6 * 450 = 75 haste rating.  So I'd use that for your ballpark estimate until the next version.<br>
<br>
And thanks for the kind words of appreciation.  And yes, you just ran into one of the major issues with this sheet: it's a pain to maintain.  And I've thought some days that I really should fix that. Unfortunately, fixing it is *even* *more* work, so for now it will have to do.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Yeah, the 75 passive haste will give you a pretty close estimate, but thats only a 4.7% haste which ~ 4.7% dps increase...seems a little low to me personally, but it will probably suffice until ald can get a possibly more accurate estimate.<br>

<br>
To add gear to the sheet, you need to UNHIDE the Armor or Weapon sheet (ranged weapons are on the armor sheet).  If you're new to this sort of thing, honestly, don't bother with adding trinkets.<br>
<br>
After unhiding the sheet, right click on the ROW and copy the entire row of an item that is in the same category, then INSERT the copied cells into the MIDDLE of the section for that type of item (bracers, leggings, etc).  Then change the name/stats of the item to match whatever you're trying to insert, and change the drop location.<br>
<br>
Hope that helps everyone out.<br>

		<div id="post_message_571929"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Oh, one extra caveat about adding weapons: pretty much any weapon that has a proc (Hearstriker, BS maces, Rod of the Sun King, etc.) will have a different formula than the other items in it's block; hence, to get correct answers, you generally want to copy a weapon that doesn't have a proc, or things could start going south for you in a hurry.<br>
<br>
This is more or less why trinkets are a pain to add as well; they almost all have procs.  However, if you wanted to add something really simple like, say, Berserker's Call, it can be done the same way... just make sure to copy another trinket with no procs (I recommend Bloodlust Brooch).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_572757"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I did a search to see if I could find info first regarding this comparison, but that left me wanting, so I'm just going to ask here and hope I'm not in violation:<br>
<br>
How well does Dory's Embrace serve the DPS of a raiding rogue against bosses, compared to the Drape of the Dark Reavers?  I haven't been very lucky with Aran (I still have the Cloak of the Inciter off Blackheart the Inciter in Shadow Labs), so I'm trying to decide whether to trade in some badges for the Embrace or continue holding out for the Drape.<br>
<br>
I'm currently specced combat Mutilate (which will have to change eventually, but works for now), but I've always leaned toward socketing for Hit Rating for the inevitable change either to combat daggers or some other weapon spec.  That said, my Hit Rating would remain above 200 even if I lost the hit on my cloak.  My biggest question is just exactly how much more/less damage I will be able to do ignoring 112 armor on a raid boss.  I guess I'm looking for some kind of percent increase/decrease to overall damage, although I'm not sure if it can be given.  I'm hoping someone with greater understanding of the math involved has an idea what kind of change it would bring me.<br>
<br>
Ultimately, I may end up getting Dory's Embrace anyway for PvP, but if the Drape of the Dark Reavers dropped afterwards, I'd still like to know how they compare so I can decide whether to pass or roll on it for raiding if someone else is interested.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_572881"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Re: Executioner.  I haven't totally decided.  I haven't read the Executioner vs Mongoose thread in a week or so, so I'll need to go back and do that before I finish that section of the sheet.  If nothing conclusive gets resolved, I'll probably just put it in with the same proc rate that's currently being used for Mongoose (1 PPM) as an approximation until such time as we know for sure.<br>
<br>
Re: Dory's Embrace.  I don't know about Mutilate, but for Combat:<br>
Short answer: Dark Reavers is better.<br>
Slightly longer answer: Shadowmoon Destroyer's Drape &gt; Cloak of Fiends &gt; Thalassian Wildercloak = Drape of Dark Reavers &gt; Dory's Embrace<br>
Even longer answer: For a more detailed and nuanced answer customized to you gear, wait about a week and then use the 0.9 sheet to investigate the matter yourself.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_574905"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->About Executioner, atleast I just changed my MH exe back to mongoose. My friend spent couple days calculating the stuff. As a result: Mongoose definetly wins against Exe on all the 7,2k armor bosses, eventho you would have all the available ArP items. On 6,2k bosse Exe wins by 0,2% w/o those items, and more if you have the items. BUT that's if you count CoR(wlock debuff, 800 armor off and 135AP buff for the target) in, and the effect of AP has not been published anywhere, so you can't know how it acts on bosses, which leads to wlocks never putting CoR on hard hitting bosses. So with CoR off, mongoose wins vs exe even more on 7,2k bosses, and now also wins on 6,2k armor bosses(you could maybe get exe a lil better on 6,2k's with all available ArP). <br>
<br>
And this is the rogue situation, for warriors, shamen and paladins Mongoose wins even more.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Pretty sure he was being sarcastic...as a ploy to take a jab at the previous poster.<br>
<br>
Carnivori:  That is all well and good, but without others here seeing the math to back that up, it becomes suspiciously anecdotal and thus pointless to look at.  If you can provide the math that your friend did, great, people can look over it and decide whether or not its' useful data.  <br>
<br>
Of course, the thing that arises from your statements is the fact that there is an entire thread about Exec vs. Mongoose and I'm pretty sure that everyone is still up in the air about it.  So for someone of unknown origin or ability with unknown data to come forward anonymously and make statements that counter that of an entire thread...ah well, post your stuff and lets' see whatcha got! <!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Well, according to my 0.8 sheet here:<br>
<br>
Double Mongoose: 1487 DPS<br>
Remove Mongoose from MH: 1452 DPS<br>
Remove Mongoose from OH: 1471 DPS<br>
Remove Mongoose from both hands: 1436 DPS<br>
<br>
So, going from double mongoose to no mongoose drops you by 51 DPS out of 1400, or about 3.6%.  Which debunks the "Mongoose is 5% DPS" assertion, which makes me doubt the rest of it as well.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_575409"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Ah, okay, missed that.  But I would still argue that holding the value of Mongoose fixed is erroneous, as it floats with the value of other stats just like Executioner does.  Anyway, counterargument time:<br>
<br>
In my copy of the 0.8 gear spreadsheet (which does start with a base boss armor of 7700) my damage estimate is 1486.91.  If I remove Mongoose from my MH, that drops to 1452.03.  If I then apply 840 additional armor reduction, my damage then increase to 1530.14, an increase of 78.11.  According to the spreadsheet, the uptime of a 1 PPM buff (which, for the moment, we will assume Executioner is, the same as Mongoose) is 43.98%; plugging this in, we find that a 840 armor reduction debuff with 44% uptime is 34.35 DPS.  Adding this to the aforementioned 1452.03 DPS gives 1486.38 DPS, which is well within the variance of the spreadsheet of being the same as 1486.91 (double Mongoose DPS).  So for the gear, talents, and buffs I have entered, the two options are all but indistinguishable (assuming the proc rates are the same, which we don't know but is a reasonably assumption to get started with).  So at the very least, there exist sets of gear where Executioner and Mongoose are extremely competitive in terms of damage contribution; hence, saying one or the other is globally superior (or inferior) at this point in time seems erroneous.  Once the proc rates are pinned down and it can be fully included in the spreadsheet, we will be able to say with more certainty; but all we can say right now is "they're pretty darn close".<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_575428"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->One thing to note is that % uptime calculations on Armor Penetration are VERY slightly off due to the fact that 840 ArPen 50% of the time is actually nicer than 420 ArPen 100% of the time.  This makes executioner a bit more valuable on the MH as you get more stacked Armor Penetration gear, especially in conjunction with WSC.  It's not a huge difference, and honestly my recommendation is to not re-enchant anything that has Mongoose on it - it's more expensive than it's worth.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>As far as I can tell, Carnivori's simply comparing the effect of the Executioner proc to the effect of the Mongoose proc.  5% DPS boost <i>while under the effect of Mongoose</i> isn't too far off accurate (+3% crit, +2% to white DPS, + 120 AP).  Similarly, the figures of 3.9%/4.8% boost <i>while under the effect of Executioner</i> is accurate.<br>
<br>
However, the uptime of a MH Mongoose is somewhat below 50%.  OH uptime is lower still, so your equivalent combined uptime comes out around the 75% mark.  0.75 * 5% = 3.75% DPS increase overall, which is pretty much on your 3.6% figure.<br>
<br>
Duration of the Executioner debuff is the same as Mongoose, so Carnivori's calculation is accurate IF (and only if) they have the same PPM.  This is not yet known with any certainty, so the whole claim is bogus.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

However, the uptime of a MH Mongoose is somewhat below 50%.  OH uptime is lower still, so your equivalent combined uptime comes out around the 75% mark.  0.75 * 5% = 3.75% DPS increase overall, which is pretty much on your 3.6% figure.<br>

</div>I understand that, so I'll qualify my statements.  <br>
<br>
How much armor before exec applied are you basing your figures on?  Can we all agree that there is probably a general raid makeup that would suit most raids and thus give a general/average boss armor amount?  If this is a yes, as I suspect/hope it will be, then giving a figure off those numbers would suffice for now.  Again, I realize that the proc is still an issue, but until its resolved, we've all agreed to use the 1 PPM so that's a non issue.  <br>
<br>
Of course the exact number will be very complex for each person, but if we can assume or at least agree partially upon a general normal boss armor after raid debuffs and then move from there with both enchants/procs and see a general idea of %dps increase. <br>
<br>
The point I'm making is, if you assumed the same armor as ald, then it would seem your math differs from his and shows exec being ~2% more dps than Mongoose.  If you assumed different, then we can look at a redo of the math with the inclusion of different armor values and go from there.<br>
<br>
It seems like we're making this much harder than it has to be about getting perfectly exact numbers, when in fact, you've all already stated that getting exact numbers for each person is nigh impossible.  Every person's gear affects their relative value of each enchant differently.  So if we take a normal/base raid boss armor value, minus "normal" raid buffs and then include the effect of each enchant, can't we get a general amount?  And this only comes up because I see 3-4 different sets of numbers, one being the spreadsheet I know and love, and would like to know which set of numbers to base my assumptions off of.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

My post was only made to show that the numbers posted above were incorrect. Doing "manual" calculations on this subject is totally pointless, the two enchants are too close to decide between them based on rough numbers. Even when the new sheet comes out you may find that it depends on personal factors such as arp gear etc. One cannot claim that one is better than the other in general solely based on napkinmath, anyone doing so should be regarded with a great deal of suspicion.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Yes, but that's still a potential source of confusion!  There's also a further potential error, which is that (I believe) the "Mongoose fades from you" message is not specific to MH or OH.<br>

0s   You gain Mongoose  (MH)<br>
8s  You gain Mongoose  (OH)<br>
23s Mongoose fades from you  (unspecified)<br>
29s Mongoose fades from you  (unspecified)<br>
 <br>
 <br>
Is that 15s on the OH and 29s on the MH (i.e. three procs, with an MH refresh), or is it 23s on MH and 21s on the OH (i.e. four procs, with MH and OH refreshes)?</div>

Maybe it uses other means to track buffs than the combatlog (UNIT_AURA, UNIT_AURASTATE, PLAYER_AURAS_CHANGED events come to mind).<br>
<br>
Maybe there is need for an diffent "procwatch" that does not rely on combatlog messages.<br>

		<div id="post_message_578489"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I was specifically referring to the issue Songster mentions; I resolved it for purposes of analysis by assuming that the proc that started first finishes first *unless* it occurs between 14.5 and 16 seconds after the second proc started.  This should work in most cases, except in the case when both hands have refreshing procs that overlap each other, but there's not a lot that can be done about that.  I think made the usual assumption about procs over 16 seconds being 2 procs, over 31 being 3 procs, and so on, which, while not entirely accurate, tends to be pretty close.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Re: Edit: what he was referring to (I think) is a cooldown shorter than the length of the buff; for instance, Mongoose has a duration of 15 sec; if the cooldown on it was 5 seconds, you could still see back to back - and even overlapping - procs.  This is certainly possible, although I recall seeing data that made me doubt this; when I get home this evening I'll scrub that data set a bit more and see if I can confirm/deny that.</div>

</div>I checked some various mongoose parses, and have found Mongoose procs for basically every interval of time between 15 and 20 seconds; if there were any internal cooldown at all, one would expect to see a bunch of procs around 15 seconds in duration, and then the rest greater than 15+cooldown settings - i.e., a 5 second cooldown should mean no procs between 15 and 20 seconds.  Since we don't see these, I think we can safely say that there is no internal cooldown at all.  Or if there is, it's so short you can't tell the difference between a min-length refreshed proc and a nonrefreshed proc, which is more or less the same thing in the end.</div>

</div>Wow, you answered quick! Yeah, you are right... something close would be better than none. I'll have to look and see about how to add an item. My biggest problem is that I played her for a while and have gotten quest items and tossed them because I thought they were not as good as what I had. This spreadsheet and many other sources have told me I was just plain wrong on some of my choices. I was big on AP and that was about it. I've slowly found that sometimes the highest AP on an item doesn't always make it better. <br>
<br>
I'm slowly trying to repair all my previous mistakes. BTW, I want to thank you for all the work you've done on this spreadshit. It's been helping me immensely lately.</div>

		<div id="post_message_579137">Well, I've been reading through the last two pages to make sure I've fixed all the bugs you all have found, so I happened to see your post pretty quickly.  Not that I don't spend entirely too much time checking these forums the rest of the time, but that's a separate issue.<br>
<br>
Anyway, speaking of bug fixes: I've made a bunch of changes (listed below), but Savefile doesn't seem to want to let me upload stuff right now, so I guess I'll have to wait to post it.  I'll try again tomorrow morning before I leave for work, and, if that doesn't work, I'll try posting it from work.  If you come up with any more bugs beyond the ones listed before then, let me know.<br>
<br>
*Fixed the hit rating display bug<br>
*Changed hit rating to crit rating on Vindicator's Pendant of Triumph<br>
*Added Garren's fix to weapon enchants.<br>
*Fixed a glitch (or at least, I think it's a glitch; I can't tell what the heck I was thinking when I wrote that section) with ring enchants.<br>
*Updated backstab damage numbers for DontMindMe's discovery regarding Sinister Calling (see Roguecraft 101 if you didn't see it go by).</div>

</div>From your later comments I think you have this sorted out, but in case it helps you or someone else... yes, LOOKUP requires the lookup_vector or array to be in ascending order.  <br>

HLOOKUP and VLOOKUP are alternatives which do not have this restriction.</div>

		<div id="post_message_579868">A couple of quick comments on Executioner/Mongoose:<br>
<br>
1) Both are currently modeled as 1 PPM, which, based on recent data, is probably not true.  However, they seem to have roughly the same proc rate, so their relative value is probably about right; they're both just worth somewhat more than listed.<br>
<br>
2) Which is better depends heavily on the total armor pen up on the mob; hence, make sure you have the armor pen debuffs (Sunders, FF, and CoRecklessness) configured as you want them when comparing them.<br>
<br>
Offhand, it seems that for 7700 armor bosses with typical debuffs, Mongoose vs Executioner is pretty much a wash; however, for 6200 armor boss, Executioner is a fair amount better.  Thus, I personally am of the opinion that Executioner MH/Mong OH is probably the best overall option.</div>

I'm not sure how common such a waste would be, but the mere threat of it seems to suggest that Mongoose might be the safer bet</div>

</div>Having additional sources of armor penetration from your own gear would also increase the value of Executioner.  I am not sure if the haste from Mongoose will increase the uptime on proc-able equipment, though.  These two things may be something additional to keep in mind.<br>
<br>
Also note that 6 bosses in Black Temple have 7700 armor while 3 have 6200.  In Mount Hyjal, all 5 bosses have 6200 armor.  Most Tempest Keep and SSC bosses are at 7700, except Fathom-Lord, Vashj, Solarian, and Kael at 6200 with Void Reaver at 8800.  So in a general sense, if you are still working on tier-5 content, switching to Executioner may have less overall value than to a rogue in tier-6 instances.</div>

		<div id="post_message_580153">Well, lets look at it a minute.<br>
<br>
Assuming a 6200 armor boss, if we have Sunders (2600), Faerie Fire (610), and Recklessness (800), reducing base armor to 2190.  With Executioner and WSC both proccing (I'm neglecting Madness for the moment, since 95% of people who have both WSC and Madness also have DST, and will be using it), Armor pen will cap out if you have more than 350 passive armor reduction - which isn't that hard to do, at T6 gear levels.<br>
<br>
But: that's not necessarily a bad thing.  On average, both Executioner and WSC are only up together about 15% of the time, and in the other 85% case, you're dealing with a low-armor target which is exactly the case where Executioner excels.  Hence: even if you're wasting some armor pen in the 15% case, you're that much better in the 85% case, so it can still be worthwhile.  Eventually, if you get *enough* armor pen, you get to the situation where you're capping out too strongly and need to drop either WSC or Executioner; however, this takes more than the above 350 armor pen.  Normally figuring this out might be hard; but, thankfully, the spreadsheet tracks it for us.<br>
<br>
For example, if I take the default gear of the sheet, add Curse of Recklessness, set the base mob armor to 6200, swap Ashtongue Talisman for WSC, and then start artificially adding armor pen, we observe the following relative value of MH Mongoose and MH Exec:<br>
<br>
With no armor pen at all (i.e., subtracting out the 350 that's on existing gear), Mongoose scores an Offensive value of 116.27, and Executioner 142.97.<br>
<br>
With the 350 that's on the gear by default, Mongoose scores 116.34 and Executioner is up to 147.65<br>
<br>
If we then start adding additional Armor Pen from there:<br>
<br>
+50 extra ArPen (400 total from gear):  Mong 116, Exec 144<br>
+100 extra ArPen (450 total from gear): Mong 116, Exec 141<br>
+200 extra ArPen (550 total from gear): Mong 116, Exec 135<br>
+300 extra ArPen (650 total from gear): Mong 116, Exec 129<br>
+400 extra ArPen (750 total from gear): Mong 116, Exec 122<br>
+500 extra ArPen (850 total from gear): Mong 116, Exec 116<br>
<br>
So it's not until you cap out by almost 500 armor penetration that Mongoose finally overcomes Executioner.  And sets of gear with 800+ passive armor penetration + WSC are few and far between; so I think in general it's safe to not worry too much about capping ArP.</div>

	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>Ald, I currently have full t6 and 602 armor pen + WSC, so I have a few questions.<br>
<br>
As for my armor pen gear its: <br>
<br>
<a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=31026"><span><span class="purplename">[Slayer's Handguards]</span></span></a><br>
<a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=31030"><span><span class="purplename">[Slayer's Shoulderpads]</span></span></a><br>
<a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32497"><span><span class="purplename">[Stormrage Signet Ring]</span></span></a><br>
<a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33496"><span><span class="purplename">[Signet of Primal Wrath]</span></span></a><br>
<br>
None of this will be replaced anytime soon.<br>
<br>
I was considering picking up Madness if I got the opportunity, because I think in 'real world' situations it's a better trinket, since more of it's power is derived from passive stats and a higher proc uptime, therefore I see you getting more out of it on hectic fights that require a lot of movement.<br>
<br>
So according to your above data that puts Executioner + mongoose within 13 AP of each other--almost a wash. So if I'm following you, the optimal setup would be executioner main hand + madness (instead of wsc), to avoid the -1000 penetration of WSC capping out? <br>
<br>
However, I see executioner being wasted on such bosses as Gorefiend who seems to be more 'squishy'? (Although some data whose accuracy I haven't been able to verify claims his armor is still up there)</div>

		<div id="post_message_580860">Well, my short answer would be "plug it into the spreadsheet, play around with the options, and find out for yourself".  In terms of a more direct answer: my instinct would be to say that Exec/Mong with WSC (rather than Madness) will be your best option, but I'm mostly just guessing.<br>
<br>
I do agree that Ashtongue Talisman has some limitation in terms of utility on movement-style fights; it's incredibly powerful on stationary cycle-spamming fights, but less good on trash and movement fights due to the need for regular cycles.  So, personally, I pull out my WSC for use on such fights and leave Ashtongue for the more static fights.  Madness would be a good option as well, but my guild (quite reasonably) has prioritized other classes for Madness as it's such a small upgrade for us.</div>

		<div id="post_message_580913">Hey all, I've been having an argument with a guild mate about the existence of a crit cap for rogues, and was wondering if you could help me out.<br>
<br>
I can't seem to find any numbers in the spreadsheet threads, and when my crit spikes up to ~53% in raids (assuming all procs are up) I want to make sure I'm not wasting any of that available dps. As far as I see it the cap wouldn't be until boss dodge - expertise mitigation + your miss percentage, but I have no hard evidence for that. Recount usually shows my crit for boss fights to be in the range of 41-45% depending on the fight so I have a feeling that I'm not hitting a barrier, but maybe I'm just lucky.<br>
<br>
Anyway, hit table guru's your help would be appreciated.</div>

		<div id="post_message_580938">So, as far as I know, the only crit cap is as follows:<br>
<br>
If your crit rate ever becomes high enough that all regular hits get pushed off the attack table, additional crit has no effect as crit cannot push dodges, misses, or glancing blows off the attack table.<br>
<br>
So, with a base miss rate of 28%, a base dodge chance of 6.25%, and a glancing rate of 24-25%, the crit cap would be about 100 - 28 - 6.25 - 25 = 40.75%.  So, if you have no +hit or expertise whatsoever, your crit cap will be 40.75%.  In practice, if you have, for instance, 205 hit rating and precision (which most raiding rogues should have) for a total of +18% hit, your crit crap is roughly 58.75%.  If you also have Weapon Expertise, you gain another 2.5%, and any hit rating or expertise you have raises it further.<br>
<br>
Hence, what one finds in practice is that the crit cap for most raidin rogues tends to be somewhere over 60%, meaning it will generally not be an issue except on fights like Loatheb where there is a +crit buff, and on fights where for whatever reason you need to attack from in front (the last of which that I know of what Thaddius).</div>

</div>Gorefiend is listed as a 6200-armor boss.  The other two from BT at 6.2k are Shahraz and Gathios (from Council); Essence of Suffering (Reliquary phase 1) has 0 armor.

The 6th step was just an attempt to find a downward slope on Executioner value in the 6200 Boss Armor/No CoR treatment, which was pretty much 800 armor penetration more than the 6200 Boss Armor/CoR treatment, as expected.<br>
<br>

I apologize for the poor quality of the images; I copied Excel graphs into Paint to make them.  Similarly to Aldriana, the value of Mongoose surpasses Executioner around 800 armor penentration, assuming use of WSC.  Surprisingly, Executioner still retains higher spreadsheet value even on 7700-armor bosses, though the differential is pretty small without the use of CoR.  So, back to my previous post, rogues still battling in tier-5 instances (with their greater proportion of 7700-armor bosses) should see less of a difference between these enchants than a rogue fighting predominately 6200-armor bosses or with access to several good-quality pieces of armor penetration gear.  Some of changes in enchant value, particularly for Mongoose, are probably just scaling issues caused by using inferior DPS gear for the purposes of maximizing passive armor penentration.</div>

Two minor things.  First, though they're worse than the other available weapons in ZA, it'd be nice to include the <a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33493" target="_blank">Umbral Shiv</a> and <a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33495" target="_blank">Rage</a> at some point for people that are mainly limited to badge/za gear.  (Unless you're human, it turns out that Rage is virtually equivalent to Heartless in said gear).<br>
<br>
Second, having added those in my own copy, I discovered a minor bug in the primary display tab.  If you select a weapon with gem sockets (of which there are none atm), it correctly only lets you select gems for the right number of total slots, but it displays 'optimal' gems for 3 slots, regardless of how many gem slots the weapon has.<br>
<br>
All three 'optimal gem' fields currently read<br>

		overflow: auto">=IF(Weapons!$W$89&gt;0</pre>
</div>and from looking at the other 'optimal gem' slots elsewhere it looks like the second and third should read<br>
<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px">

		<div id="post_message_582837">I was hoping that I could get some suggestions on a quick formula to "up-value" on-use items like Berserker's Call due to fight downtime.  My logic is this:  in a fight where you are frequently forced to do 0 DPS, on-use trinkets' cooldowns are effectively shortened.  In other words, you have a larger percentage of DPS time where the trinket is activated.  Essentially, I'd like to figure out the break point at which "X sec downtime/min" makes on-use items better than passives.<br>
<br>
The concept behind this is something I've been mulling over lately, and have been experimenting with using Berserker's Call over WSC &amp; Ashtongue on various fights, and finding more and more where it is better.<br>
<br>
Right now, my first guess would be something like this:<br>
<br>
If normal value is:<br>
Value = staticVal + [uptime / (cooldown - uptime) ] * activeVal<br>
<br>
Then adjusted value is:<br>
(where times are in decimal minutes)<br>
Value2 = staticVal + [uptime / (cooldown - uptime - downtimePerMin * cooldown) ] * activeVal<br>
<br>
Does this look reasonable?</div>

if that is the case then forced 0 dps times could be<br>
Value = staticVal + [(uptime*activeVal)/(cooldown-timeOOC)]  This distributes the "on use" portion across the entire time in combat.<br>

		<div id="post_message_584410">I guess I haven't been doing enough reading because I seem to have missed some of the explanations for assumptions that people are making.  So I just have a couple of clarification questions.  <br>
<br>
First, regarding weapon enchants people are debating mongoose/mongoose VS. executioner/mongoose right?  Why not executioner/executioner?  <br>
<br>
Second, and perhaps related to the above, why is there an armor penetration cap and what is the cap determined by?  Is it just artificial, because it certainly doesn't seem to be: "you've removed all of the boss's armor" and thus are capped.  That is, no one is talking about armor reduction anywhere near 6200 or 7700, unless I've been adding things up in my head, incorrectly.</div>

		<div id="post_message_584419">Regarding point 1: If your OH Mongoose procs while your MH Mongoose is up, you wind up with 2 stacks of Mongoose; that is, you gain the benefit from both hands at once - we refer to this as Mongoose "stacking" with itself.  Executioner does not "stack" with itself; it overlaps itself.  If Executioner procs on your OH while your MH Executioner is up, the OH proc replaces the MH proc, so you wind up with only one proc active.  This significantly reduces the value of the 2nd Executioner enchant, such that once you have Exec on one hand, it is clearly better to use Mongoose on the other; and it's pretty easy to show that if Executioner is worth using at all, you should have it on your MH.  Hence, the only sensible options are Mongoose/Mongoose and Mongoose/Executioner.<br>
<br>
Regarding point 2: Remember that boss debuffs also apply.  So, if you have, for instance, 5xSunder (2600), Faerie Fire (610), and Curse of Recklessness (800) up on the boss, and both WSC (1000) and Executioner (840) Proc, you now have a total of 5850 armor pen on the boss; hence, if you have 350 passive armor pen, you have capped out by reducing the mob's armor to zero.  This is generally not a concern against 7700 bosses, but against 6200 bosses it is pretty straightforward to get into these situations if your guild uses all available armor debuffs.</div>

		<div id="post_message_584670">One thing to always keep in mind is that when any item, such as the Brooch, is introduced to the game, it does not automatically mean that it will be of a certain value/quailty based on the other items that are introduced at the same time. Blizz does a fairly decent job at trying to keep itemization on a smooth progression for the players, but sometimes they also have other goals in mind. I would guess that the Brooch is meant more for non-raiders who don't have acess to much better equipment for this slot, but are wanting more stam. But if you have any doubts and as the residents here have said, always check the spreadsheet. I'd trust it more than any perceived value based on cost or boss drop. That's one of the reasons it was developed. Math doesn't lie. </div>

</div>It's a piece of blizzards attempt at giving raid geared tanks who are too mitigation heavy to generate any rage/threat in a 5 man an alternate gear set that isn't just using old blues and/or DPS gear. So it's heavy on Stam and expertise for the parry avoid. It's not a rogue item, and really, it wasn't meant to be. It's not a <i>bad</i> item for rogues... it's just not as good as another item thats availiable <i>from the same vendor for the same price</i> and is therefore pointless unless you are really hurting for stamina.</div>

</div>Well, the issue is that each piece of gear is optimized individually according to your current gear.  It doesn't recommend full sets of gear; it recommends piece by piece.  So when you get to that hit threshhold, it's telling you that any individual piece will be improved by swapping some hit for agi - which is true.  But once you swap that out, everything else remains better as hit.<br>
<br>
I admit it's a bit confusing, but that's sort of the limitation of spreadsheets.<br>
<br>
Also note that you have it set on weighted total, meaning that it's factoring in the dodge from agility.  If you set it to Offensive to get pure DPS optomization, or changed the defense weighting to other than the default, you would find that this problem goes away (or, at least, moves to another place in the gear space).<br>

</div>So, the first part of that is that it never makes sense to put Executioner on both weapons, as Executioner from two weapons does not stack like Mongoose; the buffs overlap each other instead.  So what you may find is that if you're using Mongoose on both weapons, it may recommend Executioner for both weapons; but once you change one of them to Executioner, the other will recommend Mongoose at that point (because the value of the second Executioner is rather low).  So, it actually often does make sense to do Executioner MH, Mongoose OH.<br>
<br>
The rest is probably the common problem with effects of highly comparable quality; switching from one to the other changes the value of both.  However, I can't rule out the possibility that there may be some additional bug; if you link/send me your spreadsheet, I'll take a look.</div>

Well, I knew about the overlapping thing, but that still doesn't quite answer my question. For my spreadsheet, I just used the best Rogue stuff out there at the moment, namely T6 because my guild is 4/5 Hyjal 2/9 BT and I would like to know how to gem to make the most of it, but that's neither here nor there. Anyway, the question of why Exec MH/Goose OH was a good combo for Glaives was when I first saw some Rogue (can't remember the name) with that setup, as well as Lars from Blood Legion. And putting it into my spreadsheet, it was a difference of like 20ish DPS, which to me seems pretty significant given that Goose/Goose is thought to be the best for Rogues.</div>

And yea.. 1 AP at 1k AP will increase your dps by the same amount as it will at 2k AP.. or 10k AP.  The PERCENTAGE gain will decrease as you get more and more AP.. but the dmg done will increase linearly.  Granted, going from 1k to 2k AP.. you'll almost definately have gained a sizable amount of  hit, crit, armPen, haste, expertise, etc... which all scale with AP.<br>
<br>
I'm sure you're aware of this, Arindelest, more just pointing this out as further clarification for the guy you quoted.</div>

		<div id="post_message_587467">My guess would be that, while Mongoose scales linearly, Executioner does not. Agility will increase your DPS by a fixed amount (neglecting the little differences depending on Haste, Hit etc.). Armour Penetration on the other hand is a percental increase. So the higher your DPS, the more it will favour Executioner over Mongoose. Equipping a second Warglaive results in a real DPS boost due to the set bonus, so that might explain the phenomenon you've encountered.<br>
A difference of 20 DPS is odd, though. If I switch gear and buffs around, the difference is never more than 5 DPS (assuming 7700 armour).<br>
<br>
Edit: I guess this has been elaborated sufficiently before and I should have checked the new replies before I submitted my hour old response :/ My apologies.</div>

<br>
About Mongoose having a part that scales on a percentage basis I had done some math in the executioner/mongoose thread no one seemed to have commented, but anyway I found that the crit and the haste were about a 2.36% increase to your damage.  So overall that is 1/3-1/2 of the benifit you get from mongoose.  I had also noticed a trend in how the percent damage increase from mongoose seemed to be decaying, but also seemed to have a lower bound.</div>

		<div id="post_message_587831">When I was looking at the percent changes I was looking at all parts of the damage a raiding rogue has.  For instance the haste only applies to your white damage which is roughly 60%.  The crit applies to the white damage and SS damage, but not rupture.  This for me atleast meant that at low APs you would see that the non AP benifit would be 1/3 and at high APs you would see the same part being &gt; 50% of the benifit of mongoose.  The AP ranges I looked at went from 1400 to 3800, as when fully raid buffed I'm sure some rogues are getting up there and I wanted to look at beyond what you would normally see to find any trends I could.</div>

		<div id="post_message_588210">My weighings came from the Attack power equivalencies in the default Gear sheet with equipment as it had been saved (switched to total offensive setting to take dodge effects out of the equation).  Blessing of Kings is marked active on the sheet so that is accounted for in those numbers.<br>
<br>
So to answer your question, it's already accounted for.  2.21 is Agility expressed as an attack power equivalency and 2.10 is Haste relative to attack power with the default gear and buff options as saved in the sheet as downloaded.  The 1.21 comes from (2.21 - 1) as we can subtract the attack power portion of agility off the equivalence.  Or in other words, 1.21 of that 2.21 is coming from the additional % to crit, while 1 of that 2.21 is from attack power (as 1 attack power is clearly equivalent to 1 attack power).  It might have been more clear if I had expressed the 120 as (120 * 1) to show that its relative to the attack power contribution.</div>

</div>Yes and No, you will get the same increase in SS damage from Mongoose at all gear levels, and the value scales up with gear (aka you will gain more total DPS from a mongoose proc with 30% crit then with 25% crit), however, the increase in stats from Mongoose is static aka, it is always 120 Agi and 2% haste, whereas Executioner is a % increase in both white and SS damage (not poison or rupture).  So for the same reason hit is typically worth more then AP beyond a certain point of inflection, because it is a % increase instead of a flat increase, Executioner passes Mongoose at a certain level of gear due to the fact that it doesn't have a fixed component.  The amount Executioner increases DPS by is based on the bosses current armor, so depending on gear, debuffs, etc, the value can vary significantly (I have a BoI with both Executioner and Mongoose, that I swap based on the boss and raid configuration).</div>

If I was told that BoK'd Agility was worth 2.21 AP then I would assume that the AP component of that 1.1 (IE the Crit component would be 2.21-1.1 = 1.11).  That would lower the crit/haste fraction of the Mongoose benefit.<br>
<br>
AP (Linear) 120*1.1 = 132<br>
<br>
Crit (Scaling) 120*1.11 = 133.2<br>
Haste (Scaling) 31.54*2.1 = 66.2<br>
<br>
Total Scaling = 199.4<br>
Total = 331.4<br>
<br>
Scaling fraction = 60.2% (instead of 63.8%)<br>
Linear fraction = 39.8% (intead of 36.2%)<br>
<br>
It's not a lot different but it's significant.</div>

	</tbody></table>
</div>This seems correct to me. If BoK is turned on, then you have to account for it in determining what fraction of the agility to attribute as equivalent AP. Incidentally, you'd also have to account for Vitality or Sinister Calling, if those talents were in place. However, Vitality would be only a 4% boost and Sinister Calling isn't modeled on that sheet (last I checked), so they wouldn't be quite as important to account for.<br>
<br>
EDIT: It also seems to me that once you take out the attack power portion of the "points", the leftover "crit" part should match up to the value of crit rating in a predictable fashion. IE, you should be able to take the remaining point portion, divide by any %AGI gains (BoK, Vitality), then multiply by the ratio of AGI-&gt;Crit% vs. Crit Rating-&gt;Crit% and the result should be the same as 1 point of crit rating. If it doesn't, then chances are AGI is getting weighted incorrectly somehow (or that we are missing a factor of gain from agility somehow).<br>
<br>
EDIT #2: Putting in a second edit rather than making a new post. I just took a few minutes to come up with the calculation I was trying to describe above.<br>
<br>
<b>Assumptions:</b><ul><li>BoK is active</li>
<li>Vitality is taken as a talent</li>
</ul><br>
<b>Equivalency Calcs:</b><br>
<b><i>Thanks to Aldriana for catching the error w/ Vitality</i></b><br>
<br>
<i>Directly, 1 AGI is worth 1.122 Attack Power</i><br>
1 AGI * 1.1 (BoK) * 1.02 (Vitality) = 1.122 APEP<br>
<br>
<i>1 AGI is worth 0.622 Crit Rating</i><br>
(1 AGI * 1.1 (BoK) * 1.02 (Vitality) )/40 ~= 0.0281% crit<br>
1 CR/22.1 ~= +0.0452% crit<br>
0.0281/0.0452 ~= 0.622<br>
1 AGI ~= 0.622 CR<br>
<br>
Further using the CR -&gt; APEP conversion given the numbers on the sheet...<br>
<i>1 AGI is worth  APEP via the +crit contribution</i><br>
1.752 (APEP of 1 CR) * 0.622 (CR/AGI) ~= 1.090 APEP<br>
<br>
<b>1.122 (AP portion) + 1.090 (CR portion) = 2.212 APEP per point of agility</b><br>
<br>
The sheet actually assigns AGI a value of 2.207 APEP (a bit less than my predicted value), but this is close enough to be within rounding errors. (I did a good bit of rounding.) They are close enough to say that using the default gear in the sheet, roughly the DPS gain of any AGI increase will be from increased crit, and the other half from increased AP. This means that over half of Mongoose scales up with gear (the crit and haste portions), while slightly less than half gives a static benefit (the AP portion).</div>

After downloading your spreadsheet and looking at the numbers, it seems that my optimal hit is much lower than I thought it should be.  Is the goal to get as close to the optimal hit through gems and enchants as possible?<br>
<br>
I just brought my hit down from 313 to 242, in strict obedience to the spreadsheet, though I find it rather disconcerting to lose so much hit, now that I'm farming T6 areas with some of of the best rogues on my server.  <br>
<br>
In book form I'm sure this thread would end up being over 300 pages long, so I'm not ashamed to admit that I've only read some of it, not all.  This subject must have been brought up before (like the fact that the top rogues in the best guild in the world all have over 300 hit).  Can you or anyone reiterate the argument (it must have been compelling) for moving so far away from +hit?<br>
<br>

By the way, if sword rogues are doing 2-3% more damage in comparable gear, then Blizzard has made a profound mistake.   Swords are for leveling, farming, and are there as another option for raiding.  Daggers are more fun, more challenging, more rewarding, and bring out the essence of the rogue...stealth, subtlety, and devastating burst damage in pve or pvp.  <br>
Remember when they nerfed weapon expertise to no longer reduce the severity of the damage reduction of glancing blows?  That was because at the time the weapon skill talent deep in the combat tree had become so powerful that pve rogues had no other option but to spec combat.  There were no choices because any other spec was getting beaten so easily.  Now Blizzard has done their best to create dps parity, not just between rogue specs but also between the classes as a whole.  Of course, now we know that they overlooked swords.  But I don't think it will last.</div>

		<div id="post_message_589930">I don't know what you're talking about with Weapon Expertise.  You have a lot of opinions stated as fact, but the change to weapon skill affecting glancing blows did NOTHING to change combat's PVE sustained DPS superiority.  The only major shift in rogue "dps parody" (I think you mean parity) was the recent changes to hemo, which does not alter the basic answer of rogue spec questions "go combat" but merely changes it to a matter of degree (i.e. "How deep in combat should I go?")<br>
<br>
Also, I'm not sure who you're alluding to in your post about the "top rogues in the best guild in the world", but I'm going to assume it's Nihilum, to which I'll say - world firsts are not generally about 2-3% differences in DPS.  Raiding 7(?) nights a week will have MUCH more effect on progress than even 10% extra DPS.  World firsts are about coordination and dedication, not optimization.  Now, I will admit that their rogues obviously cannot SUCK, but we're talking about the last 5% of a rogue's DPS, at which point differences like slight changes in dps due to gem choices (especially at a hit/Agi inflection point where they're so close in value to one another) just won't make that major of a difference.<br>
<br>
I personally tend to gem with agi/hit in everything, regardless of the spreadsheet's whims, because it values the 8 agi, 4agi/4hit, and 8hit gems very very close for my gear.</div>

</div>As Shaker stated, you seem to bring a lot of opinion to the post as pure fact.  It's not.  Combat has always been the superior build and the only change has come with BC going from daggers to swords as the dominate spec.  Looking at "top guild" rogues is pretty futile.  If you look at most of their gear, they will have almost every peice possible and able to mix and match the very best peices in for the best combo of stats.  Every peice of gear has a mix of stats, some mixes are better than others.  Swiftstrike shoulders and Mantle of darkness is a good comparison.  Swiftstrke has 2.4% haste which ~ 2.4% dmg while the mantle has almost 1.5% hit.  That's a lot of hit on one item, but strictly speaking, the 2.4% haste &gt; than the hit and crit gained by the mantle.  It's sad, but hit isn't the be all, end all.  Sometimes that 30ap and 1% crit &gt; 20 hit or w/e trade-of you're doing.  Look at total dps output, not at +hit vs everything else.  <br>
<br>
Also, if you are combat dagger/mutilate and beating sword rogues of equal/comaparable stats/gear, you should have a talk with them.</div>

</div>Couple of points here:<br>
<br>
1) Just so we're clear, "optimal" hit in the spreadsheet doesn't mean "the best amount of hit to have", it means "if you socket everything 100% optimally, this is what your hit will be".  I'm not sure if you were unclear on that or not, but I figured I'd throw it out there.<br>
<br>
2) As an addendum to Shaker's point: there are actually some reasonably ignorant rogues in top-end guilds; success is correlated more strongly with playtime than game knowledge.  The knowledge helps, to be sure; but playing 50 hours a week will get you through endgame bosses faster than any amount of theoretical knowledge if you only play 20 hours a week - as exhibited by such errors as the following:<br>
<br>
*One of the Nihilum rogues, a while back, posted a guide indicating that Dragonspine Trophy was the 3rd best rogue trinket, behind Madness of the Betrayer and Ashtongue Talisman of Lethality.  Spreadsheets tell us that this basically isn't true for anyone.<br>
<br>
*In the early days of the expansion (like, around the time of the world first Hydross kill), I armoried one of the Death and Taxes rogues (this being back in the era with D+T was still getting world firsts), and saw him wielding Spiteblade MH/Hope Ender OH.  Even in those early days of expansion theorycraft, it was well established that OH weapon speed was very important... my off-the-cuff estimate at the time was that he would have been better off using a <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30569"><span><span class="greyname">[Proximo's Rudius]</span></span></a> rather than Hope Ender.<br>
<br>
*Or as an example closer to home: I have been told by rogues in my own guild (which, while not quite on the level of Nihilum or D+T, is still a fairly respectable guild that has now killed Illidan over 20 times) that they select gear by - and I quote - "how much of a woody I get while looking at it". There's no analysis going into at all; they just pick based on guy instinct.<br>
<br>
Point being: being in an advanced guild does not guarantee theoretical knowledge of the game.  For theoretical background, you're better off coming here for advice than going to any rogue in a high-end guild.<br>
<br>
3) Addressing the actual point about hit: this is a matter that a lot of people, even in the theorycraft community, seem to have trouble with; I admit it's a subtle one, but it's very important to understand.<br>
<br>
<b>Hit is just a number.  Damage is what matters.</b><br>
<br>
Hit is a beneficial stat that tends to appear on lots of items that have good DPS scores.  However, there is nothing magical about it; there is no critical amount of hit that you absolutely must have to deal good damage.  It's true that if you select the highest-damage gear available to you, you will tend to have 200+ hit rating; but that doesn't mean you need 200 hit to do good damage; it means that if you select good gear, you tend to have high hit rating.<br>
<br>
I've heard rogues make comments like the following: "I know item A is better, but I'm going to use item B instead because I need the hit."  This drives me nuts.  If item A is better, it's better.  You'll do more damage with it.  Why, then, would you choose to do less damage in order to make one of the numbers on your character screen larger?<br>
<br>
So, to answer the question: your hit goes down because you are using better, higher damage gear, that happens to get that damage from stats other than hit; hence, you do more damage, but have less hit.  Some high-end Illidan rogues have 300+ hit, either because A) the gear/socketing they've chosen happens to have that much, or B) because they're stupid and are using suboptimal gear so as to have a larger number on their character screen.  Either way, it's nothing to worry about; after all, hit is just a number.  Damage is what matters.</div>

</div>This is where this spreadsheet delivers as promised, it gives you a pretty good idea of what items are better than others in terms of your current stat distribution and spec. It's by no means an universal source of incredible DPS but will certainly help you improve if you are new to the end game PVE.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Also, I'm not sure who you're alluding to in your post about the "top rogues in the best guild in the world", but I'm going to assume it's Nihilum, to which I'll say - world firsts are not generally about 2-3% differences in DPS.  Raiding 7(?) nights a week will have MUCH more effect on progress than even 10% extra DPS.  World firsts are about coordination and dedication, not optimization.  Now, I will admit that their rogues obviously cannot SUCK, but we're talking about the last 5% of a rogue's DPS, at which point differences like slight changes in dps due to gem choices (especially at a hit/Agi inflection point where they're so close in value to one another) just won't make that major of a difference.</div>

	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>Also, you can't base much on the spec's of anyone farming BT now, most people respec for Arena after the raid week, the raid week is now down to 1 or 2 days for top tier guilds, and some rogues have basically decided it isn't even worth respecing then, and are fine doing less DPS.  In other words, people should draw conclusions based off seeing a rogue in a top 100 guild spec'ed mutilate or 0/31/30 or 20/0/41 or 11/9/41 thinking it is the new best thing for rogues, basically the guy logged out with a PvP Spec, and might be in PvE Gear.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

The only piece of ZA gear that competes at the T6 level by itself is the ring, which is, in fact, the 2nd best ring in the game and indeed superior to the Exalted Hyjal ring.  The bow is not generally worth it compared to the top ranged weapons; however, as you're using Twisted Blades rather than Arcanite Steam-Pistol or Barrel-Blade Longrifle, it might be worth considering.  To get more detail, you will need to use the spreadsheet.<br>
<br>
According to the spreadsheet Ancient Sin'dorei Longbow is now going to do more dps for me than the Arcanite Steam Pistol, I'm assuming because the armor penetration on the Longbow will scale with what I already have.  So I've swapped them. <br>
<br>
Anyway thanks Aldriana for the explanation, I'll keep it in mind as I adjust to having what I percieve as an uncomfortably low (but apparently optimal) amount of hit.  I should also note that after bringing my hit down from 313 to 242 with 6 +10 agility jems, the ranged weapon swap described above, re-enchanting my boots from surefooted (+10 hit) to dexterity (+12agi), and some smaller changes, my "rough dps" rose by (drumroll)...about 4.  Nevertheless, even if nothing drops for me in BT this week, I can still say, thanks to your awesome spreadsheet, that I have improved my rogue for the week (which isn't always the case).<br>
<br>
Incidentally, have you included the damage added by the supremely powerful "ember of azzinoth" proc on the shard of azzinoth in your dps calculations?  <br>
<br>
And sure Might of the Scourge would be a good...conversation piece for the spreadsheet, though it would amount to kind of an eyesore since we can't get our hands on it.  Up to you.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Agreed.  A lot of the major BT/Hyjal guilds run a pug group for Nax, only laying claim to the Ashbringer and the shoulder enchants, so keeping it in or putting it in seems like a good idea.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

My methodology was to run a sequence of ~2000 auto-attacks + as many Sinister Strikes as I could get in that time, and then run another sequence of ~2000 auto-attacks + Sinister Strikes + Eviscerates. Not the greatest, I know, but it's kind of a hard thing to test. IIRC The results were roughly the same, but the margin of error was enough to basically make the whole exercise a waste of time.<br>
<br>
I'd definitely be interested in knowing for sure, but given that the number of finishers for a PVE Rogue is generally quite small, the DPS contribution would be minor even if they did proc effects, so it's probably not worth the effort. If someone obsessed with the truth wants to work it out, by all means go for it though <!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I've been working on some modeling projects, and it occurred to me that there's a detail that I've been ignoring.  It doesn't make a huge difference, but, nevertheless, I'd like to know.  And that detail is: can finishers proc stuff?  That is, if I Eviscerate, can it proc my MH Executioner?  My OH Mongoose?  Both?  Neither?  What about Rupture?  What about SnD?  What about effects like WSC?  Given the rate that we do finishers at is relatively low compared to other attacks I don't think this is likely to be a huge difference, but... I'd be curious to know.  Anyone have any data/experience with this?</div>

		<div id="post_message_591673"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Well, WSC would be easy to test as it gets around the whole "did it proc off the finisher or off the white attack" issue.  For the rest: it seems like the best way to do this would be to dequip your OH and use a proc with an instantaneous effect (Romulo's Poison Vial, maybe) and look for double procs, using a methodology similar to what Latito describes.  You should be able to set it up so you only have the finisher + white attack within a 2 second-ish range, meaning any double proc would have to come from the finisher.<br>
<br>
Only downside is that, given that the proc rate for a 1 PPM effect is down around 5%, you'd have to do at least 400 finishers before you even *expect* to see a double proc.  I think what we're seeing here is that it's a hard thing to test - which makes sense.  If it were easy, we'd've done it already.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_591676"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->There's a (well, comparitively) simple method for checking this - spec Setup, sit and doge a blasted lands mob, use evisc and cancel auto-attacks (a macro with /stopattack should make this possible) immediately afterwards.<br>
<br>
You'd be able to tell if WSC can proc off an evisc before long at all since you KNOW it won't proc off even accidental auto-attacks, but you'll have to be very methodical about making sure no autoattacks sneak in if you want to test other procs.<br>
<br>
This should be doable with all finishers as long as the stopattack macro doesn't let any autos sneak through, but I think Aldrianna would be the one to come up with the # of finishers you'd have to perform for us to be reasonably sure of a negative result (i.e. if Mongoose doesn't proc after 100 finishers.. etc).  Sorry, but my stats background is limited to 1 class in the basics and helping a significant other at the time who was a stats major on her homework here and there.  :P<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_591796"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Ah, yes, that would do the trick.  I'd forgotten about that technique.  So now we just need someone to go through and test with some common procs for Evis, Rupture, and SnD.  WSC will be easy to deduce; at a 25% proc rate, 10 finishers will be enough to be 95% sure about the answer, and 16 will get us to 99% certainty.  Mongoose, Executioner, etc. will be somewhat harder due to the lower proc rate, admittedly; however, a good rough picture of what's going on will be fairly easy to come by simply by loading up lots of procs to test at the same time.  For instance, put a different enchant on each hand, a different poison on each hand, and 2 proc trinkets on, and you're doing 6 tests at once.<br>

		<div id="post_message_591871"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->The Servants in Blasted Lands work fine for short or medium length testing (or if you bring a class which can heal once every 5 min).  Ogre Spirits in the back of DM North work well for longer tests as you don't get hit.<br>
<br>
None of these mobs are lvl ?? so the miss/dodge chance will be skewed (slightly less on the Halaa guards).. won't make a *huge* difference to your cycle.  Lose some hit rating or get a tank/healer to go to MC/ZG/etc with you if you really want to test and reflect a more accurate amount of combat potency regen.<br>
<br>
Not trying to knock you - its just I don't really see much of a purpose in the Halaa guards considering they DO require a substantial amount more healing and aren't much closer to 73 than other mobs.  That said - do you dodge/parry on them still at this level?  Perhaps that would balance out with the decreased miss chance.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Due to the Expertise, that really comes as no surprise to me. I have SotS bagged and ready to equip once I can replace Al'ar's gloves with T6. Maybe this week... fingers crossed.<br>

The question I have revolves around the Expertise "cap". I am currently capped (possibly over-capped) at ~6.5%... haven't seen a dodge (WWS parses) since 2.3. I'm using Al'ar gloves &amp; vashj belt, plus of course the human racial. That being said, if I remove the expertise from SotS, I come out ~1:1 vs Deathmantle. Yet, the spreadsheet shows them as an ~8 DPS upgrade. So I'm wondering if the sheet "sees" the cap or not?<br>

</div>As to the spreadsheet not accounting for the cap, that seems to be the case.  I set my current weapon to have 500 expertise and checked my dps, then bumped it up to 1000 expertise and my dps kept going up, despite (clearly) being past the cap.  Hit rating does however become worthless past cap in the spreadsheet.<br>

		<div id="post_message_592820"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I hear the spreadsheet has a good answer to that question.<br>
<br>
In a general sense.. FLK chest &gt; T5 even.  If you can hold onto any 2 of T4 shoulder/helm/gloves (pants if you don't have skulker).. you might consider that.  Often 2pc T4 isn't worth breaking until you have 4pc T5, however if you have most/all of the T5-equivalent offset pieces, you might be fine.  Also, it depends on your spec.  Most of that ^^ assumes combat swords (or fist/mace I guess.... a sinister strike build w/ proper talent points).<br>

		<div id="post_message_592959"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Think of it this way. The spreadsheet is the sum of all known theorycrafting. It is automatically more correct than any piece of calculation that one of us could spend a couple of hours hashing out - it has a lot more game mechanics and theorycrafting taken into account.<br>
<br>
Every game mechanic you can think of is accounted for by the spreadsheet. The same is true for a large number of valid and known game mechanics you wouldn't think to ask about.<br>
<br>
It is not perfect, but it is the best tool we have by a good margin.<br>
<br>
Items may individually be better than the T4 piece, but the T4 bonus is powerful, and losing it loses you overall dps. The chest is a very good item, and you'll probably want to use it - if you can keep the T4 bonus using different items, such as perhaps the T4 legs. Try out different scenarios using the spreadsheet.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Not to push this issue much further, but last night in Dire Maul I decided to test this again.  I did over 60 deadly throws and not a single one proc'd WSC.  Any time the SS/Shiv I used to get the combo point would proc WSC and I'd simply wait until the CD was gone.  Even if I occasionally didn't wait long enough - after 60 deadly throws you'd think at least *1* would proc.  Consider the 25% chance to proc, well 0.75 ^ 60 isn't exactly great odds for "It might still proc!".  I did get 2x DST procs though.  It seems weird that it wouldn't proc WSC.. it is a special attack.  And yea, everything from sap to Expose Armor to.. you name it.. procs WSC otherwise.  Basically anything which applies to the target, and not a self-buff.  I wonder if Blade flurry attacks have a chance to proc it...<br>
<br>
That said, this whole thing doesn't really matter in terms of a DPS modeling, as DT (or almost all of these other abilities) aren't modeled in a consistent long-term DPS scenario.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>All of the above is indeed true and the spreadsheet can -- and usually should -- be trusted.  In case the others did not hit upon your question, the reason the 2-piece tier 4 set bonus is powerful is because it allows the rogue to shorten his/her cycles down to 1s/5r or 2s/5r.  Essentially what this means is that it enables you to redistribute energy use towards rupture uptime whereas before you would need to use that energy for a longer slice and dice.  Without the 2-piece tier 4 set bonus, most sword rogues will find themselves falling somewhere between 3s/5r and 4s/5r while <a class="itemlink q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32492" target="_blank">[Ashtongue Talisman of Lethality]</a> users go for 5s/5r.  The details behind this have been explained several times in different threads and I am confident that you can find it with a little search effort.  ;-)<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

So if you want to add [Master Assassin Wristwraps] to any spreadsheet, you will have to open the spreadsheet.<br>

(Using german version of excel, trying to translate to english)<br>
<br>
- Format -&gt; Sheet -&gt; Show -&gt; Armor -&gt; klick 'OK'<br>
<br>
- Find Nightfall Bracers (line 68) -&gt; copy whole line by clicking on the 68 and hitting CTRL + C -&gt; right-click the 68 and select "paste cells"<br>
<br>
- Rename Cell A68 to Master Assassin Wristwraps<br>
- Change J68 to 17 (Agi), M68 to 50 (AP), N68 to 18 (crit), AC68 to 1 (yellow socket), AK68 to 2 (socket bonus 2 crit), BL68 (drop source) doesnt need to be changed (clever me took a heroic item to copy paste Wink )<br>
<br>
- hide the armor page (or leave it there if you want to add more armors)<br>
- save sheet<br>

		<div id="post_message_593889"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->So, I know that it is typically reccomended to drop 2 pc t4 when you get 4/5 t5.  I'm just a bit confused then why the sheet values t5 gloves at 55 ap and the 2 piece t4 as only 51 ap.  I'm currently using Head/Gloves of t4.  I don't think there is much different in the sheet that I changed.  I put Spinesever back to the un-nerfed state (I don't like thinking about mine getting nerfed) and put in my gear and buffs.  Though I must have done something, because Deathmantle chest is also reading as better than Bloodsea Brigand's, which I'm pretty sure is not the case.  Only thing I can think of is the sheet is telling me to socket with agi over hit.<br>
<br>
On a side note I have noticed that either as newer versions have come out, or as my gear improved, not sure which but one of the two has slowly lowered 2pc t4 from the 70 or so I remember it at to the 50 it is now.<br>
<br>
One last thing, would it be possible to change the recomended trinkets to detect what trinkets you are wearing, I've got WSC and Bloodlust brooch and it keeps telling me to get DST and WSC.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<!-- message -->
		<div id="post_message_593914"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->One thing to note is that the relative value of the 2pc T4 set bonus is going to get lower as the 'cost' of moving towards a 5s/5r cycle gets lower.  That is, if 5s/5r gives better DPS than 1s/5r, and it's sustainable w/o 2pc T4 (which it is), then the 2pc T4 set bonus has 0 real value.  As you get better gear, you move further toward a point where your Sinister Strikes do enough damage to outweigh the lost rupture DPS, and I think that's what you're seeing.<br>
<br>
Also, the 2pc T4 till 4pc T5 thing still SORT of holds (though is MUCH weaker with S3 hat/chest/shoulders being near T5).  The gloves are a big upgrade, for sure (~50 points alone), but the leggings are generally around 20, so you can just go back from T5 legs to T4 legs to "gain" 30 EAP if it recovers the bonus.  This is a position that I'm also in at this time.  :P   I have S3 Helm/Chest, Shoulderpads of the Stranger, T5 legs, and all 5 T4 pieces - at this point the optimal setup for me is to use the T4 legs/gloves, till I get T5 gloves, and then at that point it's more optimal for me to use S3 helm/chest, SotStranger, and T5 Gloves/pants.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>So, the point here is that while there are single items of T5 that beat single items in T4 pretty badly, you can get those upgrades and still keep 2/5 T4 for a while; you can be wearing up to 3 pieces of T5 and still maintain 2/5 T4.  So, while it's true that replacing T4 gloves with T5 and breaking the bonus is an upgrade, it's also true that switching to T5 gloves and reverting some other slot to T4 to keep the bonus is a still larger upgrade.  Now, not all people have all of T4, and even if you do there are certainly gear combinations you might have that would cause it to make sense to break the bonus sooner.  However, as a general rule, if you have all of T4, you can generally find some 2-piece combo that's worth it until you make it up to 4/5 T5.<br>

</div>It's probably your gear improving.  At lower levels of itemization T4 2/5 is worth more; as your gear scales, the advantage of compressing your cycle drops considerably.  For instance, in my current gear, T4 2/5 is only worth 18 AP.  If I had Warglaives, it would only be worth 11 AP.  And if you work a little bit, you can come up with gear sets where T4 2/5 is totally useless.<br>

</div>Yeah, trinket and ring recommendations are on my list of things that in an ideal world would get fixed.  Also on that list:<br>
<br>
Stat Summary blocks<br>
Friendlier UI to access the next-stat information<br>
Socketed Weapon<br>
Restructure recommendation system so it doesn't zero out the value of equipped items from ineligible zones<br>
Replace buff yes/no dropdowns with checkboxes.<br>
Model Shadowstep contribution to DPS (it's actually pretty hard and makes almost no difference whatsoever, but I'd still like to do it)<br>
<br>
...and possibly a few others that I'm forgetting right now.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, I have neither time nor inclination to work through that list right now; bugfixes is about all I have time for, between work and... shall we say... other theorycraft related topics.  I have had a few people talk to me about assisting with/taking over development of the sheet, but I haven't totally decided what I want to do about that; when/if such an arrangement takes place, some of these features might start to show up; until then, they are pretty unlikely.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I was considering these points last night during another mundane romp through farmed content.  How large of a role does armor penetration play in influencing optimal energy use cycles?  Certainly this falls under the "improving gear" umbrella for most pieces of gear (e.g. <a class="itemlink q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=31030" target="_blank">[Slayer's Shoulderpads]</a>, <a class="itemlink q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=31026" target="_blank">[Slayer's Handguards]</a>, <a class="itemlink q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33496" target="_blank">[Signet of Primal Wrath]</a>, <a class="itemlink q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32497" target="_blank">[Stormrage Signet Ring]</a>); however, typical gear upgrades generally follow a corresponding increase in attack power that simultaneously buffs both sinister strikes and ruptures.  Armor penetration, on the other hand, will not influence rupture damage but certainly will increase sinister strike damage.  Although I'm sure this is all included in the spreadsheet cycle calculations, do you suppose that rogues with high passive armor penetration, MH executioner enchants, and <a class="itemlink q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30450" target="_blank">[Warp-Spring Coil]</a> should seek elongated cycles?  Would the same apply to very high critical strike situtations (say, always having a feral druid + <a class="itemlink q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32492" target="_blank">[Ashtongue Talisman of Lethality]</a> + Mongoose enchants) where sinister strikes are increased in damage while rupture is not?  In other words, if you use equipment and/or raid setups that benefit sinister strikes more than ruptures are you justified in going for cycles longer than what the spreadsheet recommends?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_598939"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->So, an answer in 2 parts:<br>
<br>
1) Yes, Armor Penetration and Crit are the two mods that increase the value of SS relative to Rupture the most; meaning that if you have abnormally high Armor Pen/Crit, elongated cycles are more likely to be better.  However, AP has a similar effect; at any reasonable Crit/AP level, SS scales faster with AP than Rupture.  So, fundamentally, all 3 favor SS.<br>
<br>
2) However, all this is considered in the spreadsheet; when you reach the gear level where longer cycles become better than shorter cycles, the spreadsheet will start recommending a longer cycle.  So should you use cycles that are longer than the spreadsheet recommends?  Generally not.  There are exceptions (like using 5s5r to get better use out of Ashtongue Talisman) - but, fundamentally, when you get to the point where 5s5r passes the compressed 3.Xs5r cycles, the spreadsheet will let you know.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_599128"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I don't think much beyond 5s/5r is really sustainable without a 2nd SnD in the cycle somewhere, and since eviscerate is pretty much universally worse than rupture (where rupture is usable), any 5s/5r/Xs/Xe cycle would be compressable into a Xs/5r cycle.<br>
<br>
But I might be wrong. <br>
<br>
<br>
I should also add that 5s/5r is pretty much your "max SS dmg" build, since you are spending ZERO energy on finishers, only using them to keep SnD up (necessary) and blow combo points that accumulate via use of SS on the highest damage finisher that takes 0 energy (rupture).  <br>
<br>
So you're really using as much energy as possible on SS, while keeping SnD up - the 5pt rupture is just free extra damage, costing 1 GCD (not an issue) and 0 energy.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_599152"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->So, the point is, 5s5r has the maximal number of Sinister Strikes; you're spending 0 energy on finishers and thus Sinister Striking as fast as you can based on your regular energy regen.  Hence, going to a 5s5rXe cycle won't get your more Sinister strikes per unit time; it will actually get you less, as you're now spending 10 or more energy on the eviscerate.<br>
<br>
Now, to be perfectly frank, I haven't done any analysis on 5s5rXe-type cycles myself; they were shown to be inferior with the Rogue DPS spreadsheet almost a year ago, and I haven't felt the need to revisit the topic since.  My suspicion is that the energy efficiency advantage of a small Eviscerate relative to a Sinister Strike is insufficient to offset the loss of rupture uptime, but, again, I have not proved that.<br>
<br>
It should be noted, however, that 5s5rXe cycles are really only doable with 2/5 Netherblade.  Consider: for a typical non-2/5 rogue, the optimal cycle is roughly 3s5r.  This means that you generate enough energy for 8 combo points in the duration of a 3-point SnD.  Going to 5s5r generates 8.7 extra seconds of SnD uptime, but costs an extra 80 energy to get the combo points.  Given that energy regen with combat potency is about 13 energy per second, this means you gain a net of 13 * 8.7 - 80 = 33 extra energy by switching to 5s5r.  Now, a 1-point Eviscerate costs 20 energy, and provides .6 combo points; hence, we need to sinister strike an extra .4 times to get a 1-point Eviscerate in.  .4 Sinister Strikes costs 16 energy; hence, we would need to have 16 + 20 = 36 slack energy to perform 5s5r1e... and we just said that we only had about 33.  So 5s5r1e is only barely supportable - if at all... and a 1 point eviscerate is less energy efficient than a Sinister Strike.  Hence, no cycle of this form can be optimal without 2/5 T4.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>With regard to the Ashtongue trinket:  We currently suggest that rogues use a 5s/5r cycle upon getting this trinket in order to maximize its use.  Separately, optimal cycles get longer as gear progresses.  So, does this mean that the value of the Ashtongue trinket will also increase with gear in the sense that one is no longer "forcing" the long cycle because it is already optimal?  Certainly there is some lost dps by going 5s/5r at relatively inferior gear setups (I vaguely remember Aldriana saying this difference was small) even though there is a net gain in dps due to the trinket.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_599192"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->So, cycle expansion to more fully realize the merit of Ashtongue Talisman is sort of one of those advanced concepts that it's hard to make a general rule for.  Fundamentally, it's good to do if 5s5r is competitive with 3s5r anyway, but if you already have a gap between them, Ashtongue won't close it.<br>
<br>
To clarify this, some napkinmath.  Currently, Ashtongue Talisman tends to be modeled as ~70% uptime; however, by using 5s5r and energy queueing, you can effectively get about 90% Ashtongue uptime on yellow attacks (not 100%, as if Ruthlessness doesn't proc you have one SS outside of Ashtongue).  So we're getting an increase of about 6.5% crit, on 20% of our yellow attacks, which comprise about 30% of our DPS; hence, the net DPS increase is about .065 * .2 * .3 = .0039 = .4% of one's total DPS.  So a rogue doing 1500 DPS gains maybe 6  DPS from energy queuing with 5s5r.<br>
<br>
To put this into real terms: the spreadsheet, with my current gear and typical buffs for my guild, recommends a 3.1s5r cycle, and asserts that it does 1800 DPS.  The 5s5r cycle shows 1789 DPS, neglecting Ashtongue manipulation.  If we increase the Ashtongue uptime for yellow attacks from the computed 72.7 percent by 20% to 92.7%, 5s5r dps shows as  1795 DPS.  So, in general, it's probably not worth it for me to drop to 5s5r; I will usually do better with my regular cycle.<br>
<br>
Now, this sort of subtlety is, of course, hard to make a hard and fast rule for, so, at the moment, every player must sort of make a judgement call about whether they think it's worth it for them.  Ideally, the spreadsheet would handle this by keeping track of how much "slack" there is in your cycles to allow manipulations such as this.  Unfortunately, handling "slack" would be extremely challenging for a spreadsheet format, so until we have a more sophisticated framework for DPS computations (such as a calculator written in a real programming language, which I have started some work on but am still several months away from having something usable) it's not really going to be feasible to measure the real benefit of Ashtongue in the spreadsheet.  In the meantime, people will have to take their best guess - knowing that it's usually a small effect, accounting for roughly 5 DPS.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_599297"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Quick question, why are all the reccomended gems 8agi when i'm only at 185 hit? wouldn't a hit increase give more overall dps than 8agi? also why not 10agi? am i missing something here?<br>
<br>
Also can the list of reccomended gear be extended beyond 3? and are set bonus taken into account with those reccomendations?<br>

		<div id="post_message_599317"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->There is a setting in the Advanced Settings tab for "Use BT Gems".  Default is off I believe.. at any rate, you have it set to off so it won't recommend +10 agi gems.  For agi to be better than hit when you only have 185 hit, you likely have REALLY low ap/crit or a bad set of talents.<br>
<br>
Link your spreedsheet or armory if you would like any further tips.<br>
<br>
As to the last question.. Spreedsheet and the information listed in this thread and Roguecraft 101 is generally equivalent.  It doesn't list 20 items to pick from.. but you can select any item you want and compare.  What specifically are you wanting from that site that you haven't found for rogues?<br>
<br>
Note - rogue stuff will be, overall, more complex than druid for the simple reason that we have 2-3x the applicable talents, more special attacks and generally move complex cycles.  Not saying that anything you have for a druid can't be done for rogues, but it generally takes more effort and therefore marginally useful stuff is more likely to just not get done.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_599319"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->So, lets see here.<br>
<br>
First, my suspicion is that you probably have it set on weighted total rather than Offense only, which is the default for the sheet.  On Weighted Total, some benefit from the dodge gained via agility is scored (not much, but a little) which tends to bump Agi ahead of hit in overall quality.  However, if you want raw damage numbers, set it to Offense only, and you will probably see hit pull ahead of agi.<br>
<br>
Second, as for why 8 agi rather than 10 agi: presumably because you have elected to turn BT gems off on your sheet (on the Advanced Settings sheet).  If you set "Use BT Gems" to yes, it should recommend socketing with 10 instead.<br>
<br>
Third: just because your hit is low does not necessarily mean that hit is going to be better.  Hit and Agi loosely synergize each other, but not as strongly as some stats; hence, it's entirely possible that, even in low hit situations, low-hit gear can still be good.  It's be a bit surprising, mind you, but it's not impossible.<br>
<br>
Fourth, regarding extending the recommendations table: in theory, yes.  In practice, it'd be a lot of work.  Adding and removing lines to front page UI is... somewhat challenging.  There's a lot of references that break when you try to rearrange cells.  So don't expect such a feature to be added to a major release anytime soon.<br>
<br>
However, if you'd like to make some extra cells elsewhere for more gear recommendations, it's easy enough to do; just find someplace where you have the space to make cells, and copy the formulas over.  For instance, consider the helm rankings; the 3 suggested upgrade cells currently read as follows:<br>
<br>
<h1><a href="#top" class="nuwiki_top_link">[top]</a>INDIRECT("'Armor'.A"&amp;MATCH(VLOOKUP(HelmEQ;ArmorStats;2;FALSE())&amp;" "&amp;1;ArmorRanked;0))<br>
</h1><br>
INDIRECT("'Armor'.A"&amp;MATCH(VLOOKUP(HelmEQ;ArmorStats;2;FALSE())&amp;" "&amp;2;ArmorRanked;0))<br>
<h1><a href="#top" class="nuwiki_top_link">[top]</a>INDIRECT("'Armor'.A"&amp;MATCH(VLOOKUP(HelmEQ;ArmorStats;2;FALSE())&amp;" "&amp;3;ArmorRanked;0))<br>
<br>
IF you simply copy this into a cell somewhere else and increment the ranking, you can get the 4th, 5th, and 6th helms with these formulas:<br>
<br>
</h1><br>
INDIRECT("'Armor'.A"&amp;MATCH(VLOOKUP(HelmEQ;ArmorStats;2;FALSE())&amp;" "&amp;4;ArmorRanked;0))<br>
<h1><a href="#top" class="nuwiki_top_link">[top]</a>INDIRECT("'Armor'.A"&amp;MATCH(VLOOKUP(HelmEQ;ArmorStats;2;FALSE())&amp;" "&amp;5;ArmorRanked;0))<br>
</h1><br>
INDIRECT("'Armor'.A"&amp;MATCH(VLOOKUP(HelmEQ;ArmorStats;2;FALSE())&amp;" "&amp;6;ArmorRanked;0))<br>
<br>
If you additionally want the upgrade margin, you can copy the cells in column H as well; for instance, cell H9 reads<br>
<h1><a href="#top" class="nuwiki_top_link">[top]</a>ROUND(VLOOKUP(G9;ArmorStats;5+ValueTypeInt;FALSE())-D8;2)<br>
<br>
If you replace the G9 with whatever cell you used in part 1, you'll get the upgraded value.<br>
<br>
Or, if you're feeling lazy: just unhide the Armor sheet, and look at Column H; it gives the rankings for each slot.  For weapons this information is in column F; for Trinkets it is in column D.<br>
<br>
Fifth, regarding that link: it appears that that page primarily exists due to a fluke of druiddom that causes maximal DPS to happen to lie along the agi </h1><br>
str line.  I'm not aware of anything analagous for rogues, if for no other reason because there are 7 different stats that regularly appear on our gear that help DPS in a reasonable item-budget efficient way; Agi, AP, Crit, Hit, Haste, Armor Pen, and Expertise are all perfectly good mods (some are better than others, of course, but they're all reasonably effective).  Hence, making a chart of the balance lines between them is, well, hard - and, moreover, staying on the X=Y lines is unlikely to maximize DPS.  So I don't really see a good way of making a chart analagous to that for rogues.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_599334"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->First, thankyou for such a detailed reply, the interesting part of that druid page is further down where a model has been made for the standard attack rotation, and yea, its possible because feral dps is a single spec, and most variables are easy to condense to a % increase in dps or at least an easy to model value when only one rotation is considered<br>
<br>
I must say, i am suprised agi rates higher than hit, but my gear is mostly welfare epics and i'm mace spec as alts dont get into many raids and i enjoy PvP, i had it on offensive but apparenty my agi was still too low ^^<br>
<br>
I found the bt gem option after i went poking around for the armor sheet, thanks though. and yea, i can see the complication with including so many specs/trinkets/stats etc<br>
<br>
P.S. one last question, why was the gladiator chest included, but not the shoulders or legs? simply number of available items for the different slots?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
If you want to add an item yourself you can.  There is a detailed post somewhere in this thread explaining it, but basically you:<br>
unhide the Armor sheet<br>
find the section with the type of armor you wish to add<br>
insert a new row WITHIN that section (not above/below.. in the middle so ranges expand properly and still get everything)<br>
Copy and existing row and paste it into the newly created row.  I'd suggest something that wasn't part of a set so you don't grab the flags which count the item towards a set bonus<br>
edit the stats to match your item (mostly in the first few columns)<br>

</div>Question:  is a cycle always the optimal solution?<br>
<br>
Let's assume that I'm at a gear level where 3s/5r is the optimal cycle.<br>
<br>
If I get a lot of CP procs back to back, it may well let me do something like 5s/5r/3e, even if that is not sustainable in the long run.  Conversely, if I have a long streak of no CP procs, then if I don't have any "saved" energy, I won't able to compress my cycle down to 3s/5r, and I'll have to go for 4s/5r or even 5s/5r.<br>
<br>
Now, what is my optimal strategy?  Should I stick to a fixed cycle of 3s/5r, saving the energy from CP proc streaks to tide me over for long non-proc streaks?  Or would I be better off using 5s/5r, and then tossing in an occasional Eviscerate once I've accumulated enough energy?  In the latter case, what I'm essentially doing is trading in a little bit of rupture uptime for a higher percentage of Sinister Strike and the occasional Eviscerate.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>So, those are for estimating the relative value of defensive stats; in particular, they're needed to know how "good" dodge and armor are relative to armor.  "Fraction of incoming attacks where armor value conceivably matters" refers to what fraction of the damage done to you is mitigated by armor in a useful way.  For instance, mitigation is utterly useless on Archimonde, as if he hits you at all, it'll be for 20k+ damage, and you're gonna die no matter what your mitigation is - and the rest of his damage is all elemental.  On the other hand, for, say, Hyjal trash, mitigation does matter, since you're mostly taking physical hits that are small enough that mitigation reduces your incoming damage in a useful way.  Similarly, the dodge/parry cell is what fraction of incoming damage can be dodged or parried; hence, situations like "pulling aggro on  Archimonde" or "getting bounced into a cleave on Magtheridon" are covered.  Neither of these cells are used for offense calculations at all; they're purely for estimating how good stamina is versus agi, dodge, armor, etc.<br>

</div>It's an interesting idea, to be sure, and, again, I haven't run the numbers to see, but my instinct is to say that the answer is no, for two reasons.<br>
<br>
First, doing such a non-cycle in practice is actually quite hard.  After you do your 5 point rupture and accumulate 3 more CPs, at that point you need to decide whether you have enough energy/time to use those 3 CPs towards an Eviscerate and still have enough time to get 5 more for the SnD.  The problem is, you're making this decision 10-15 seconds before the end of the cycle, and you don't know what your combat potency luck is going to look like for that time.  Hence, I suspect doing such a rotation would be very error prone in practice, and you'd end up misjudging fairly regularly and needing to improvise something to get back into your cycle.<br>
<br>
It might be a little better to plan something like 5s5r5e3s5s5r - that is, build up to 5 CPs, see how much time you have left, and the either do the regular SnD a full Eviscerate and a small SnD after before building back up to the usual cycle... but even this seems unlikely to be a clear winner.<br>
<br>
Second, it's not clear to me that the better use of such surges in energy regen isn't to gain higher rupture uptime; with 3s5r, no matter how lucky you get, you can always rupture pretty much as soon as you need to; your previous rupture will always have ticked of.  So if I did get lucky with procs, I'd be inclined to use it to complete a cycle in 17 seconds instead of 22 to get higher Rupture uptime.<br>
<br>
Fundamentally, though, it is something we should probably investigate at some point.  It's sort of hard to model due to all the decisionmaking that needs to occur, but I'm sure we can whip something up.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_599895"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->While we are whimsical what ifs, I recently ran a Kara with one tank, a pally.  During the run I was thinking about the proper finisher to use.  Since there was no warrior in the raid I could use Expose armor, or I could evis/rupture on the bosses that let me rupture.  I believe I ended up using Expose armor on the bosses that I couldn't rupture on and Rupture otherwise.  Though that was mostly because I noticed that I was not as far ahead on damage while I was using Expose Armor.  In that situation does that seem reasonable?

		<div id="post_message_599953"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I've actually had some experience with Expose Armor recently and hopefully this helps...<br>
Basically, my guild uses a druid MT on a lot of bosses.  We have a single prot warrior in the raid, and he is less geared than the druid.  Obviously the prot warrior tanks stuff like RoS and Illidan, but a bulk of the other bosses are druid-tanked.  Because of this, and a fairly melee-heavy raid (6-7 melee and a hunter or 2) I figured I'd try out Imp Expose armor.<br>
<br>
First, with EA you are REQUIRED to use a 5-point finisher.  Using less than 5-point makes the EA reduce less damage, it doesn't affect the duration.  EA is always 30 seconds long.  So you have a few options.. 3s/5e, 5s/5e, 5s/5e/Xr.  Doing 3s/5e doesn't actually help, since EA and SnD are up 100% of the time with 5s/5e anyways.  All it does is make your SnD cost 10 energy (Effectively, long-term).  Not to mention it is more suseptable to bad CP streaks resulting in one or the other falling off.  5s/5e/3r isn't sustainable.  5s lasts ~30 seconds (round down a bit since you refresh just BEFORE it falls).  In 30 seconds you gain roughly 390 energy from Combat Potency (OH at an average of 1.0 speed, 15 energy per 5 seconds).  The cycle requires 13 CP, minus 3 * 0.6 which you get from finishers.  The SnD and EA are free, Rupture costs 10 energy (60% chance its free, 40% chance its 25 energy).  This works out to ~11 finishers * 40 energy + 10 energy for finishers.  450 energy.. you gain 390.  Not sustainable.  Not to mention, a 3point rupture every 30 seconds just really isn't a huge dps increase.<br>
<br>
Therefore, 5s/5e is the preferred rotation (unless someone can find something better?).  Its super easy, can be done in BAD gear (1.5 spd OH, no haste, ~200 hit).  With a 1.4spd OH, static haste and 2pc T6 and 350 hit.. I would have to be unconscious to fail at keeping both up 100% of the time.<br>
<br>
Now, for DPS estimates.  The current spreadsheet puts me at 1875 DPS with the set of buffs I had last week on Teron.  Thats for 3s/5r.  If I drop to 2/5 (instead of 4/5) Vile poisons, I get a 5s/5r dps of 1854.  Of that, 83 dps is attributed to Rupture, so take that away and I'm at 1771 dps.  I added a new buff, Imp Expose Armor and set it up, turned it on and turned Sunder x5 off.  I now have a 5s/5r dps of 1944.  Subtract the 83 dps I from rupture to get 1861 dps.<br>
<br>
So, 1861 dps, compared to 1875 (if I was spec'd 4/5 vile and let the warrior sunder).  14 dps loss personally, but every melee in the raid goes up by ~75-80 dps.  The prot warrior will go from dps'ing and sundering to just dps'ing.. I'm sure he'll gain back at least the 14 dps I lost by not having to use sunder.<br>
<br>
On Teron this week I ended up at 1793 dps doing that.  It was a loooong kill due to 23-manning it (don't ask), short 2 dps and getting mostly dps'ers ghosted.  Aside from 1 BL in 6 min instead of 1 per 10 min.. nearly every CD was at approx the average uptime rate.  Not sure what I did wrong, but 96% of my theoretical isn't *too* bad I guess.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_599954"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->So, this isn't conclusive, to be sure, but: I just whipped up some approximations for a nonsundered opponent.  For the Rupture cycle, I'm using my regular optimal cycle, Xs5r.  For the Expose cycle (which I will denote as 5s5a, as "e" is taken for Eviscerate/Envenom), I'm using the numbers from the 5s cycle, with the armor of the boss manually lowered by 2050.  Since neither a 5 point SnD nor a 5 point Expose uses any energy, and 5s5a gives both 100% SnD uptime and 100% Expose uptime, so this should be a pretty valid approximation.<br>
<br>
I also cut down the buff level to be more consistent with a 10 man raid with no warrior present (in particular, only one pally buff and no battle shout).<br>
<br>
So, the numbers:<br>
<br>
With 7700 base armor:<br>
Xs5r: 1284 DPS<br>
5s5a: 1329 DPS<br>
<br>
With 6200 base armor:<br>
Xs5r: 1391 DPS<br>
5s5a: 1468 DPS<br>
<br>
Now, admittedly, this is for only one set of gear, and it's not going to be 100% accurate, but: off the top of my head, Expose does seem to be generally better even for personal DPS and thus certainly better for raid DPS in unsundered situations.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_599955"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Oh, also.. a while ago during one of my Dire Maul sessions I decided to test some cycles a bit.<br>
<br>
I did 10-minute runs, using BF 5x and AR twice each test.  I watched my dps on Recount and after 6-7 min it never jumped around more than 10-15 dps.  Obviously this is with NO buffs, and no other debuffs on the boss.  When doing 3s/5r I was hovering around 1200 dps, when doing 5s/5a (using Ald's abbreviation now) I got 1280 dps.  Certainly a difference large enough to rule out some streaks, considering these were over 10 minute periods as well, not just 2-3.  This was against the Gorduk Spirits in DM North, can't remember what their armor was at, but its likely around 3-4k base.  That was without Imp EA.<br>
<br>
<br>
So while that is more "anecdotal" evidence - it does match reasonably close to Ald's previous post where non-Imp EA is a personal dps increase over Rupture when no warrior is present.  By the math in my first post, Imp EA is a raid-dps increase over Sunder.  That said, you CANNOT EA on a boss when a prot warrior is tanking, it just kills threat too much.  For druid/pally tanks however, it is worthwhile.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Any DPS increase is better than zero. So you won't have enough energy for a rupture on every cycle - no reason not to throw in a rupture when you <i>do</i> have the spare energy. So your effective cycle could end up something like 5s/5e/5s/5e/3r. Or even longer if that's still not quite workable. I'm honestly beginning to think that the mindset of "must find a cycle at all costs" is going to end up with bad rogues making stupid decisions. No cycle will ever <i>perfectly</i> match your energy income. You can either use the slack energy (and thus not use a perfect cycle, shock horror!) or waste it. It shouldn't take pages of theorycraft to work out which of those two is a better option!<br>
<br>
Edited to add:  The fact that Expose armor is a better finisher than Rupture on an unsundered mob should not be news to anyone reading this thread.  In a raid situation Improved Expose is better than a full stack of sunders for raid dps.  However, in practice you can't use it if you have a prot warrior in the raid.  Even if the prot warrior isn't tanking, their personal DPS depends on the Sunder stack, which reduces or wipes out the net raid gain.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_600255"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Fair enough.  Agreed, any dps increase is better than zero.  That said, a cycle such as that still requires you to do "5s/5a/3r/5s" at one point in the rotation.  Essentially, you must get 13 combo points within 30 seconds.  Saving energy and dropping the first 5s while you have ~70 energy *should* likely allow this to happen.. but you could get unlucky of the next 30 seconds with ruthlessness and combat potency, thus dropping SnD (and likely EA 8-10 sec later also).  The MARGINAL dps increase of an extra 3-point rupture every minute just doesn't seem worth the risk.  We could do the math I guess and see what % chance you have of being able to pull off that sequence, figure out the dps loss if you lose SnD for X amount of time and see if that potential dps loss * chance to happen is less or greater than the extra dmg from rupture.<br>
<br>
Agreed, cycles are never perfect - I sometimes find myself needed to cut out a rupture set from my cycles to keep SnD up and adapting to circumstances is what keeps a rogues dps more consistant, as opposed to flopping around and being kinda streaky.  It is a balancing act,<br>
<br>
<br>
On the topic of EA usage.. clearly it was news to Nanomann, and even Ald and myself wanted to double check.  It makes sense, but its worth checking.  I'm sure there is some level of high AP, low hit, low crit, no haste or arm Pen which makes Rupture better than EA on an unsundered mob.  Likely its so damn high that the set of gear which achieves that does not exist, but still.<br>
<br>
In a raid situation, I'm not sure how the prot warriors dps is affected.  I realize they would no longer be able to Devastate, is this one of their primary moves while dps'ing, or do they pretend to be Fury and just HS/WW?  Perhaps some insight from the prot warrior thread would be good.  Good thought - it was something I hadn't considered.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I don't see that it's quite that clear cut.  First off, the fact that your energy bar is bigger than the amount of energy needed for any particular move gives you some ability to store up energy.  The cycles produced by this sheet are average cycles; during some SnDs you'll generate more energy than average, and in some you'll generate less; hence, in order to keep SnD from dropping during low-energy cycles, you need to save up energy (to the extent you can) during surplus energy cycles.  Now, this isn't 100% possible, of course - your energy bar is only so big, so there's only so much error you can absorb; this means two things in practice.  First, sometimes you will generate more energy than you can store, and thus need to "waste" some SnD uptime by shortcutting the cycle; second, to make sure that you (almost) never have a drought so large than SnD drops, you need to use a cycle slightly longer than the long-term average case to give you a cushion against SnD gaps - which, in turn, leads to more wasted SnD uptime.<br>
<br>
So, fundamentally, yes, one tends to have - depending on how you look at it - either surplus energy or surplus SnD uptime relative to the ideal cycle.  And, from a purely abstract perspective, it would be beneficial to use this to generate a little extra DPS.<br>
<br>
The problem is, it's not always possible to do so.  First, there's the simple problem that you need to make decisions at intermediate locations in the cycle - that is, if you try to squeeze an extra finisher in before the SnD, you don't know if Ruthlessness will proc; you don't know how many Combat Potency procs you're going to get in the last 10 seconds of your cycle; if it's not a 5-point finisher, you don't know if Relentless Strikes will proc; and so on.  Hence, you are still making a decision with some variance to it, and to avoid having SnD drop (or having to do a very small SnD followed by some ad hoc cycling to bootstrap back up to a normal-sized SnD, which is almost always bad) you still need to allow yourself a cushion - which brings us back to the aforementioned issues.  So while you may be able to reduce the amount of wasted SnD uptime through such tactics, you will never eliminate in entirely.<br>
<br>
Additionally, there's the fact that in many circumstances, just doing an extra SS or burning the SnD uptime is actually optimal.  Determining which ad hoc cycle components actually prove worthwhile is a problem that I don't think most people have a good appreciation for.  For instance, it has been suggested that dropping a 3-pt Eviscerate during high energy cycles of 5s5r might be better than doing the standard 3s5r.  Now, my question is: is the damage gained by the higher energy efficiency of an occasional 3 point Eviscerate enough to offset the damage lost to reduced Rupture uptime?  I would argue that the answer is almost always no; the overall energy efficiency of the cycle element is not enough larger to warrant this approach.<br>
<br>
And that, I think, is going to be the key to analyzing these; the notion of energy efficiency of cycle elements.  The concept of energy efficiency of individual moves is a fairly standard one by now; the trick is, it doesn't really tell the whole story.  What you really want to know is the energy efficiency of a combination moves.  Let me give a concrete example of what I mean.<br>
<br>
Lets compute the energy efficiency of performing a single iteration of 3s5r.  This requires 6.8 Sinister Strikes and does the damage of one rupture.  Hence, the total energy expended is (roughly) 40 * 6.8 + 10 (for the chance Relentless Strikes does not proc), and the total damage is 6.8 times the damage of a SS plus the damage of one rupture.  Working this out for the information currently in my spreadsheet gives an energy efficiency of about 37.76 damage per energy.  Note that we're ignoring the damage contribution of the SnD; for purposes of computing components of ad hoc cycles, we're assuming that due to abnormally high energy regen or whatever, we're able to do this component with 100% SnD uptime; hence, that damage will just subtract out evenly accross all builds.<br>
<br>
Now, if we compute the energy efficiency of 5s5r, we find that it's only 37.23, while the energy efficiency of a 5s5r3e component is 37.84.<br>
<br>
So: what we learn from this is that a 5s5r3e element is actually more energy efficient than 3s5r (though barely) - however, it is only more efficient by .08 damage per energy, while 5s5r is .53 DPE less efficient; hence, roughly 87% of energy would need to be spent of 5s5r3e cycle elements and only 13% on 5s5r cycle elements in order for the ad hoc cycle to come out ahead - which is clearly not sustainable.  So we find that 5s5r with adhoc 5s5r3e is inferior to 3s5r.<br>
<br>
Now, I can easily imagine circumstances - gear combinations and the like - where this will not be true; I'm sure there are times that 5s5r with adhoc 5s5r3e is better.  The problem is, this level of analysis is not something you can do on the fly; hence, making cycles up as you go is, in most cases, likely inferior.  And while I'm sure it would be possible to understand your gear and energy tradeoffs well enough to figure out for yourself when you should do what, it's most defenitely an advanced technique that only the most knowledgeable and experienced of rogues would want to attempt; it's certainly nothing I'd recommend to the average spreadsheet user.<br>
<br>
Fundamentally, I guess my point is this: the relative value of Rogue finishers are such that I don't see that a compelling case can be made to do ad hoc cycles; in the vast majority of cases, XsYr type cycles will be optimal for appropriate choice of X and Y and good energy management.  If at some point Eviscerate/Envenom/whatever becomes competitive, ad hoc cycles might be sufficiently good to revisit; but I don't think that's the case right now.<br>

</div>If the warrior is tanking, you certainly can't expose; however, the damage that a prot warrior gains from sundering isn't actually that large; even assuming they're spamming Devastate for DPS every cooldown, they're only going to gain 175 damage every 1.5 seconds (further modified by crit chance, hit chance, and armor reduction) - or something on the order of 120 DPS.  And I can almost guarantee you that the damage gained over the raid by going from 2600 reduction (Sunders) to 3075 (Imp Expose) is enough to offset both that and the ~100 DPS the Exposing rogue would be doing with Rupture.  So if one is in a guild that regularly has feral druids tanking raid bosses, it might be worth speccing Imp Expose, as it is almost certainly worth using whenever a warrior is not tanking, even if there is a prot warrior or two DPSing.<br>
<br>
Edit: I'm assuming, of course, that the warrior can still Devastate, which I believe is true; the Sunder just doesn't go off.  If this isn't true, the answer may be different... but I suspect the 475 extra armor pen is still enough to cover it, at least in a 25 man.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>It is in the case I was talking about - keeping up Expose Armor.  A 5s/5exp cycle gives you 100% uptime on both <i>and</i> some spare energy.  You have three options for the extra energy.<br>
<br>
1)  Waste it completely by cutting the S'n'D or the EA short<br>
2)  Use it for extra Sinister Strikes, and waste the combo points<br>
3)  Use it for extra Sinister Strikes <i>and</i> an occasional rupture.  <br>
<br>
As long as you don't drop below 100% uptime for S'n'D and EA, solution (3) is clearly the best option, since Rupture has better energy efficiency than Sinister Strike.  In practice it's difficult to achieve (3), since an energy buffer of 100 doesn't let you save up enough spare energy to be sure of dropping a sensible-sized rupture. <br>
<br>
The 5s/5expose cycle costs 352 energy (8.8 sinister strikes, free finishers), and your expected energy income for a 30 second cycle is ~390, i.e. you have one spare sinister strike per cycle.  So if you're thinking in "cycle" terms, that's a 5s/5expose cycle with an extra SS inserted somewhere at random in each cycle.<br>
<br>
However, I think the better strategy is to save up as much of the energy as you can, right up to the point where you're about to tick over.  Then you spend the extra energy all at once - i.e. rather than doing one extra SS per cycle, you do 2 or 3 extra SS every second or third cycle.  If you happen to get lucky with CP procs at that point, it will allow you to drop in a small rupture (better energy efficiency than SS), while if you don't get lucky, it's not wasting anything more than you otherwise would.<br>
<br>
Question:  What's the smallest rupture that has better DPE than a SS?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_600313"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->According to my spreadsheet, a 2-CP Rupture or above will be superior DPE to an SS, but only by ~11. Since this figure doesn't account for Relentless Strikes energy regen, I'd say it's still not worthwhile to perform a 2-CP Rupture, especially since a 2-CP Rupture only gains 2% of your AP per tick, whereas 3 and above all gain 3% per tick. So the smallest worthwhile Rupture is essentially 3-CP.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

It shouldn't take pages of theorycraft to work out which of those two is a better option!

</div>Fundamentally: yes, there are times (such as 5s5a cycles) where it usually makes sense to weave in something if you can.  But there's also a *lot* of circumstances where it doesn't, so on the whole I think cycles are a good thing - I believe it is the exception and not the rule when weaved cycles are able to beat static cycles.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_602848"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I have a question about a specific cell in the spreadsheet: cell G74 on the Xs5r worksheet. I assumed that each column on this sheet calculates the dps when you add one more of the relevant combat stat. So, for example, column G calculates your dps when you add 1 more hit rating to your stats. If that is the case, shouldn't the last term in G74 have a minus sign, NOT a plus sign. The plus sign increases your miss chance and, thus, calculates your dps if you were to LOSE one hit rating. There is a similar concern with cell I75. I did not check the other worksheets for this possible error, so you may need to fix those, too, if I understand this worksheet correctly.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

And as either endpoint is equally good, I can use whichever is more convenient for the particular stat.  In the specific case of the cells you mention (which will be the same in all calc sheets) I elected to compare by removing one hit rather than adding one (and doing it in G74 and I75 instead of G7 and I11) to work around the hit cap.  Subtracting 13/205 in G74/I75 would risk giving a negative hit score for people at the hit cap, which may potentially cause odd results.  Hence, I add in instead so the hit stays in the valid range.

</div>ah ok, makes sense then.<br>
<br>
In my own spreadsheet, I too have had to deal with the less than aesthetic ways of dealing with evaluating a function at different points. Is there no way in Excel to define some functions or functions in terms of letters and then just evaluate the functions for given sets of data points?<br>
<br>
For example, something like "LET(f = 1-h/1577-.0025*e/3.924-.01*p)" where f is supposed to be your chance to miss, with h your hit rating, e your expertise rating, and p your rank of precision (and LET is some Excel function I made up that ostensibly defines f algebraically). Then in some cell specify a range of cells to represent the desired values of h, e, and p. and then in another cell evaluate f for the given data. I suppose that this would require Excel to have some sort of CAS built in, and so if it's not possible, I would understand.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the usual speedy response.<br>
<br>
[Edit] For my own gear, the dps difference between +1AP and base stats on the Xs5r is ~0.308. The (absolute) dps difference between -1hit and my base stats on the Xs5r worksheet is ~0.795, giving a relative value of hit to AP of 2.584. but the dps difference between +1hit and my base stats on the same worksheet is ~0.117, giving a relative value to AP of 0.381. <br>
<br>
Now I know that the sheet is not meant to give a static AEP table, but an AEP table for each data point corresponding to each possible combination of stats. But if the plus/minus signs in cell G74 and I75 are supposed to be equally valid, they should give (at least approximately) the same AEP for a given set of data. Going from 2.584 to 0.381 is quite a difference.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_602930"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I think there are ways to do such things - in fact, I'm pretty sure the Rogue DPS sheet does them.  The problem is that they all involve macros, which starts to cause issues with OO compatability and the like (not to mention being well beyond my knowledge of Excel) which is why I chose not to use them.   It's one of the limitations of the spreadsheet format - which brings us back to the oft-mentioned "write this in a real programming language" point (which I'm working on, I swear).  Basically, doing things in a spreadsheet makes the UI work a lot simpler but it does put some fairly heavy limitations on your ability to evaluate certain things.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_603098"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I'm having trouble convincing the Balance Druid community here on EJ that Imp Faerie Fire is worth spec'ing into. The Druid themself loses a significant amount of either DPS, threat reduction, or sustainability to spec into it, but according to the Gear Sheet, the benefits are pretty crazy for those that aren't hit-capped. I show 1491 DPS with WF / LotP / Imp BS / Might / Kings / Drums / Enh Shaman, no CoR. When I compare each of these buffs to Imp FF, it comes out ahead of Might, Windfury, even LotP!

		<!-- message -->
		<div id="post_message_603109"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Well, the thing to be careful about is that while Imp FF does come in ahead of those things, the marginal difference between FF and Imp FF is somewhat smaller.<br>
<br>
Using, for instance, the stat weightings Vulajin posted in the Roguecraft 101 thread:<br>
<br>
Imp FF gives 3% hit ~= 47 hit rating ~= 2.3 * 47 = 108 EAP, plus 610 armor reduction = 610 * .29 = 177 EAP, for a total of 285 AP - which is more than Blessing of Might, almost as much as Battle Shout, and more than the 5 * 22.1 * 1.75 = 193 EAP one gets from Leader of the Pack.<br>
<br>
The thing to be careful about it: regular Faerie Fire already gives the armor pen, so speccing into Imp FF gives roughly 108 AP *additional* benefit beyond what we'd otherwise get from the druid.  Hence, each talent point gives something on the order of 36 AP benefit per rogue, which, in practice, means about 11 DPS per rogue per point.  So if you have 3 rogues, it gives a benefit of roughly 33 DPS per point, or about 100 DPS for all 3 points... plus whatever it does for the hunters, dps warriors, enhancement shaman, etc.  Also note that if you're tank isn't hit capped (and a lot of tanks aren't) it also significantly increases the tank's aggro.<br>
<br>
So, long story short: the incremental benefit from Imp FF is not quite as large as some of the others you list; however, it's still a very helpful talent for all your melee DPS and probably some of your tanks as well.  I can easily see 3/3 Imp FF increasing the tank's aggro by ~4% and increasing raid DPS by ~200.  How that compares to the other talents you could be taking, I couldn't say... but it's certainly a very respectable talent from the perspective of the rest of the raid.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_603970"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->And let's be honest, balacne druids aren't there for their amazing dps and sustainablity.  They are there for the 5% spell crit (amazing for pallies/mages omg) and possibly the imp FF.  I think the biggest benefit comes from being able to reitemize your gear with that druid using some off peices with less hit and stack more ap/crit.  I know hunters are able to drop talent points and get some other talents.  <br>

<br>
This is our Morogrim Attempt last night and I did 1588 DPS. Now that may not sound weird to most of you guys, but it is for me. I even had 2 Graves. If we look at the spreadsheet, I should go no higher than about 1370 with the buffs I usually have, but I beat that by about 200 DPS. We don't Use CoR and from the WWS, it doesn't even look like we had FF up. We don't Shaman swap or anything special to up our DPS.<br>
<br>
The only difference in what I did this week than what I usually do is, I used AR twice, because I used it earlier than i usually do in the fight, but will that make up that much of a difference?<br>
<br>
My Group: Enhancement shaman, Arms Warrior, 3x Rogue.<br>
Buffs, that may not be standard: 5/5 Shouts with Solarian's Sapphire, Imp Might, Imp Hunter's Mark, Expose Weakness (~1050 AGI).<br>
I did use one haste pot, but no food, no Elixir/Flask, no Drums. <br>
Gear: Armory, i may have my riding Trinket on, but i use WSC/DST<br>
<br>
One note as a whole Morogrim died alot faster than I have ever seen him die before in our guild at least. As you can see in the WWS, most DPS classes are about 1K DPS and that never happens.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Do the calc. It's going to depend on gear and stats. A lot.<br>
<br>
For the sake of argument, let's pick 2500 AP, 35% crit. (IE, high end stats.)<br>
<br>
Both rupture and envenom are not mitigated by armor. We'll evaluate for with or without mangle up, as well as with or without Stormstrike<br>
<br>
<b>Rupture</b><br>
Damage = 1000 + 0.24*2500 = 1600<br>
Damage w/ Mangle = 1600*1.3 = 2080<br>
DPE = 1600/25 = 64<br>
DPE w/ Mangle = 2080/25 = 83.2<br>
<br>
<b>Envenom</b><br>
Damage = (900 + 2500*0.15)*1.16*1.35 ~= 1997<br>
Damage w/ Stormstrike = 1997*1.2 = 2396<br>
DPE = 1997/35 = 57<br>
DPE w/ Stormstrike = 2396/35 = 68<br>
But, you also lose your Deadly stack for a few seconds, which is a big chunk of lost DPS.<br>
<br>
In short, the DPE is marginally better for Envenom if Stormstrike is up but Mangle is down, but you lose your Deadly stack. Losing your deadly stack is a huge chunk of lost DPS, but it might be ok in situations where you are supposed to "stop DoTs" or if the mob is going to die. (Although, if the mob is about to die you shouldn't Rupture anyway.) The comparison is actually more favorable for Envenom with T5 2pc, since you tack on an extra 200 base damage to Envenom.<br>
<br>
If Envenom crits, it is worth it, as the crit more than makes up for the lost DP stack. So Mutilate rogues, for example, can use Envenom to great effect coupled with Cold Blood. (Anecdotally, on a Netherspite kill I used Envenom to wipe my DP stack after holding the blue beam for nearly a whole phase. It crit for 13k.)<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I dont know if this was brought up before, but id like someone to tell their opinion on how envenom would perform in DPE compared to rupture using t6 equivalent gear, having 4/5 vile poisons (20/41 spec) AND considering each envenom is occassional and performed ONLY when Stormstrike (20% more nature damage)debuff is up, which is tricky , but possible.</div>

</div>Extremely poorly. Envenom is worse than Eviscerate, which is in turn worse than Rupture. And you should bear in mind that taking the Stormstrike proc (which is pretty much impossible in practice) doesn't do as much as you think for raid DPS, since you're reducing the DPS of whoever <i>would</i> have got the Stormstrike if you didn't.<br>
<br>
Use Envenom as the last finisher on a dying mob, if you don't need to refresh your S'n'D. Ignore it at all other times.  Unless you're Mutilate, when the higher crit and faster poison stacking <i>may</i> make it useful.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>If you look at the formulas closely and multiply out the buffs on Envenom from Vile Pois. and Crit rate, you get:<br>
1409 + AP * 0.235<br>
which compares very closely to Rupture's 1000 + AP * 0.24<br>
<br>
400 more damage for Envenom (600 w/ 2pc T5) and nearly the same AP modifier, at 35% crit.  That said, Mangle's buff is greater and doesn't get used up like Stormstrike (as Songster pointed out).  Not to mention envenom costs 40% more energy and kills your DP stack (~70 dps)<br>
<br>
<br>
Simply put - use Envenom only when the mob won't live for the next ~9 seconds.  Ie, your DP stack wouldn't get more than 2-3 more ticks anyways and Rupture definitely won't tick out.  In all other circumstances, an untalented Evis is often better should you find yourself in this spot - which is generally only during an AR.  On most fights with a single dps target, you will find 1 Evis per AR and 1 Envenom (at the end), rupture the rest of the time.  Not a hard-and-fast rule, but a reasonable approximation.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_606699"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->It depends on what cycle you're doing.  For 5s5r, it's better to refresh immediately and start building towards the next Rupture.  For Xs5r compressed cycles, it's generally more effective to throw the extra SS or two with the extra energy (to avoid losing energy to Relentless Strikes non-procs), although doing so risks converting your cycle to 5s5r in short order.  In order to maintain the shorter cycle you may need to do some immediate refreshes.<br>
<br>
Also note that by "immediate" what I really mean is "as soon as your energy ticks over 65".  You should sit there and let your energy tick up to save energy for the next cycle before doing any of these things, and only refresh when you're starting to risk capping out.  Generally, I prefer to refresh the instant my energy ticks over 65, as this provides a reasonable buffer but almost never caps out, as even if you get both a regular energy tick and a combat potency proc, your energy doesn't max out.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<!-- message -->
		<div id="post_message_606769"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->So, I was helping a friend with a spreadsheet he was making (on an unrelated topic), when, in the course of helping him with his problem, I figured out how to resolve one of the issues that's been bugging me about this sheet, namely, the need for two different versions of it.  I have a pretty good idea now how to fix the incompatibility between OO and Excel in the gear recommendations that has been causing the need for two versions.  I'll test for certain when I get home from work tonight.<br>
<br>
Now, that got me thinking - as long as I'm recoding the recommendation boxes anyway, why not fix some other issues while I'm at it?  In particular, the ring and trinket recommendations have always bugged me.  But then, of course, there's the question of, "what is the right behavior there anyway?".  So here's my current thinking about how to change the gear recommenders:<br>
<br>
1) Remove the gear you're currently wearing from the recommendations.  It's not at all useful to have a row in the recommendations consisting of "The helm you're wearing is exactly as good as the helm you're wearing" - that's tautological.  So rather than the current behavior where, for instance, my bracer recommendations are:<br>
<br>
Insidious Bands       26.86<br>
Deadly Cuffs             7.98<br>
Swiftstrike Bracers      0.00<br>
<br>
It would instead read:<br>
<br>
Insidious Bands       26.86<br>
Deadly Cuffs             7.98<br>
Master Assassin Wristwraps       -9.30<br>
<br>
While this is a little odd in that it's no longer displaying the "top" 3 bracers, it's reporting what's in some sense more useful - the top 3 bracers that you don't already have, and how they compare.<br>
<br>
2) All ring recommendations will be performed relative to poorer of your two rings.  So, right now the ring recommendations are fairly redundant.  I propose ripping out the 6 cells that currently recommend the top 3 upgrades to ring 1 and the top 3 upgrades to ring 2 and replacing it with a list of the top 5 rings (that you're not already wearing, as per point 1) and how they compare to your inferior ring.  This thereby tells you how much of an upgrade you'd actually observe by obtaining that ring, which strikes me as more useful.<br>
<br>
3) Trinket recommendations would work the same as rings; you'll get the best trinkets you're not already wearing, and how they compare to your inferior trinket.  I might also try to adjust the table to make room for a 3rd trinket recommendation, though we'll have to see how big a job that is.<br>
<br>
So, that's the proposal.  Comments?  Ideas?  Anything else I should fix about it while I'm at it?<br>
<br>
In other news, I would like feedback on what people perceive to be "typical raid buffs" for a 25-man raid.  When I initially filled in the raid buffs, I did it based on what was typical for the guild I was in at the time, and haven't really updated it since - despite having changed guilds to one that uses a somewhat different combination of buffs (much more use of Curse of Recklessness, for instance).  So my question is: what buffs do people want to see as the "default" set that the sheet downloads with?  Is there some "typical" set of buffs that it should start with, or should I just update it to what my current guild does and let anyone who wants something different change it?

</div>Your work is much appreciated and I think the change to trinkets/rings will be awesome, especially with trinkets. It's dicoouraging to see trinkets displayed as upgrades that I already have (DST). <br>
<br>
I think probably the default raid buffs look <i>something</i> like (although I'd like to see what other rogues out think is "normal" -- correct me if I'm off base here) what I'm about to list. <b>It seems that most of the Hyjal/BT rogues I've met tend to have a group with at least a warrior and a shammy</b>. <br>
<br>
Imp Fortitude, Imp Gift, Imp Battle Shout, Imp Blessing of Might, Unleashed Rage, Blessing of Kings(??), Imp Hunter's Mark, Expose Weakness(??), Flask of Relentless Assault, Spicy Hot Talbuk, Imp Strength of Earth Totem, Curse of Recklessness, Sunder Armor, Faerie Fire, Mangle, Heroism (1). <br>
<br>
I might add Haste Potions on cooldown, because, being as cheap as they are compared to how much money you can make, there's really no reason not to use them if you're doing progression fights.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_606811"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Those recommendation upgrades sound great, particularly for trinkets and rings. (I had to dig some today because DST was the only trinket upgrade listed for me, and I was like "Duh". But I'm not likely to get a DST since we don't do Gruul anymore and my success pugging the place has been next to nil. Thus, I wanted to see what was next on the list.)<br>
<br>
As for "typical" buffs, here is what is typical for me. (My guild is a mid-level raiding guild. We're halfway through SSC and have some TK experience, but we don't do enough hours per week to be considered hardcore end-game.) I'll follow the list with some discussion.<br>
<br>
<b>My "typical" Buffs</b><br>
Kings<br>
Might (0/5 improved)<br>
Salv<br>
Mark of the Wild (5/5 improved)<br>
Fort (2/2 improved)<br>
Windfury (2/2 improved)<br>
Strength of Earth (2/2 improved)<br>
Unleashed Rage<br>
Heroism<br>
Leader of the Pack<br>
Battle Shout (usually 0/5 improved)<br>
Spicy Hot Talbuk<br>
Elixir of Major Agility (although for real progression I'll grab a flask)<br>
<br>
<b>Relevant Boss Debuffs</b><br>
Sunderx5<br>
Faerie Fire (0/3 improved)<br>
Misery<br>
Mangle<br>
<br>
<b>Discussion</b><br>
Our typical melee group is Enh Shaman/Warrior/Feral Druid/Rogue/something, where the something is a rogue or a warrior. Usually, our warrior is prot (hence we don't get improved battle shout); he just resides in our group for tanking trash pulls. We don't run with a survival hunter, and our balance druid does not use imp. faerie fire. Our paladins are usually 41/20/0, so they don't have imp. might. (Also, the number of paladins we have in raid is highly variable, so even if one did have it we might not see it that much.)<br>
<br>
I would say, for improved buffs only put as default improved buffs that are usually taken. For example, imp. mark is taken a lot because tree druids have plenty of talent points to play with. Imp. faerie fire and imp. shouts often aren't taken, since they are talents for classes with less wiggle room.<br>
<br>
EDIT: I should mention that our locks usually run Curse of Shadows and Curse of Elements to help the casters, not Curse of Recklessness.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_606831"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->List of buffs I get: (with comments)<br>
<i>Imp Fort.</i> - Every priest, holy or shadow or disc has this.  Highly unlikely to have no priests in a raid<br>
<i>Imp Gift.</i> - Every resto druid has this, if no resto druids in the raid I'm sure a feral picked it up.  Highly unlikely to have no druids in a raid<br>
<i>Imp BS</i> - DPS warriors, Arms or Fury all have this pretty much<br>
<i>Imp BoM</i> - Most guilds have at least 2 pallies, and they are generally coordinated enough to get that talent<br>
BoK - What % of guilds have 3+ pallies?  I generally have 2 or 3.. Kings is therefore on my 50% of the time<br>
<i>Imp Hunter's Mark</i> - A lot of hunters tend to grab Efficiency, not sure how many guilds have a hunter who picks this up.  I don't think any of the hunters in my guild have it, I can double check though.<br>
<i>Expose Weakness</i> - Not really a "common" buff.  Majority of raiding hunters are BM, of the guilds on my server at a T6 lvl, I think 1 has a permanent Survival hunter.<br>
<i>Flask</i> - yep (can you add in Elixir of Demonslaying as a buff too, awesome for Hyjal and I keep adding it each release :P)<br>
<i>hit food </i>- yep<br>
<i>Imp SoE, Imp WF, UR</i> - yep.  can you add a 3rd GoA totem.. "twisted goa" with an 80% uptime?  I generally add this line in myself as well.. just normal goa * 0.8.  Theoretically a shaman could achieve 85% goa uptime (and 100% WF).. but GCD limitations and overlapping tend to screw this up a bit, 80% is (if I remember right) a generally accepted uptime for twisted goa.<br>
<i>Sunder, Normal Faerie Fire</i> - yep<br>
<i>CoR </i>- don't normally get this, not sure what guilds do.<br>
<i>Mangle </i>- always<br>
<i>Bloodlust </i>- 1 (since this is "long-term" dps.. I guess we don't need to factor in that most fights are ~3-4 min long)<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<!-- message -->
		<div id="post_message_606895"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->So, there are some buffs that are pretty obvious.  Almost all guilds are going to run with Imp PW:F and Imp GotW.  Pretty much everyone is going to have Battle Shout, Blessing of Might and Windfury at some level - and if you have Windfury, you probably also have Strength of Earth and Heroism.  Mangle is pretty common these days, but not everyone has it.  And I think it's pretty reasonable to assume that people will be using consumables (Flask + Food).<br>
<br>
On the other hand, there's some buffs that are clearly pretty rare.  I think it's safe to say that guilds where you have Improved Faerie Fire or Heroic Presence are few and far between, for example.<br>
<br>
However, in between, there are some buffs that are common but not universal.  Examples that spring to mind would be Blessing of Kings (depending on # of pallies) and Curse of Recklessness.  Some guilds use them, some don't.  Similarly, the availability of Improved versions of the buffs.  I think it's more common than not to have Imp Battle Shout, but Imp WF is less clear to me.<br>
<br>
So, the general idea is this.  I could try to specify some middle-of-the-road "most people will be about this buffed" setup.  This would probably be something like Imp Fort, Imp GotW, Imp Battle Shout, Imp BoMight, Kings, Imp Hunter's Mark, Flask, Talbuk, Str of Earth, Sunders, FF, Mangle, Heroism, and WF/DP.  This level of buff is probably pretty similar to what most people have.<br>
<br>
Alternately, I could use what's typical of my guild, which is that plus Solarian's Sapphire, Curse of Recklessness, and Drums (under the assumption that what matters most in terms of maximizing DPS is how you do on progression fights, where popping a Drum every cooldown is totally reasonable - particularly with as cheap as they've gotten).<br>
<br>
Problem with this is that there are probably guilds that don't use CoR, but regularly have an enhancement shaman so we should have *Imp* Str of Earth, *Imp* WF, and Unleashed Rage.  Or, they might have a feral druid in the group for LotP.  Or... well, you get the idea.<br>
<br>
Regarding Bloodlust/Heroism: in practice, one probably gets a more accurate estimate by bumping this to 2 to simulate one heroism in a 5 min fight.  Should I do this, or leave it in "indefinite sustained DPS" mode?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_606909"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Personal preferences - I think an enhancement shaman is a pretty good bet for most people in progressive groups.  Also, I'm not sure Improved Hunter's Mark is really that common - it's a very small buff (like what, 110 AP?) for 5 points that the hunter can spend on a better talent at that point in the tree.  I know our hunters don't have it, and 2 of them are very min/max-y.<br>

Also, I think the average fight length is still closer to 10 minutes than 5, especially if you're goal is to make this more representative of progression fights (a la drums).   That being said, I don't have any T6 experience, sooo...<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Re: Fight Length<br>
At a T5 level, yes.. most fights are 10 min (enrage timers).  Hydross, Leo, FLK, VR all have 10 min enrages.  Lurker, Vashj, Alar, Morogrim all last around 10 minutes roughly.  Solarian is a bit shorter, Kael a bit longer.  In T6 content however.. Rage, Anetheron, Kaz, Najentus, Akama and Teron are all in the 3-4 min range.  Azgalor, Archi, Supremus, BB, RoS and Mother are all 5-7 min which leaves only Council at ~10 and Illidan at ~15.  I'd say leave it at "indefinate" mode and people can tweak if they want to get a closer estimate for a given fight to compare their actual performance to theoretical.<br>
<br>
Either way you slice it, Ald.. you can't get the exact buffs right for everyone, not even the majority of people.  Everyone ends up having to review all the buffs to double check them anyways, perhaps default them ALL to off?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Because I'm trying to encourage good practices in rogue gearing.  I think a lot of people underestimate/ignore the value of defensive stats on equipment, and I for one think it's a mistake.  I'm not saying offense isn't important - it is.  The weighting of defensive stats in this is really pretty darn low.  In particular, the trade off is something like 1 DPS = 65 HP.  That is, you will gain 65 hit points for every 1 DPS you sacrifice, which strikes me as a not unreasonable tradeoff.  So I offer a way for people to turn it off if they want to, but the default is set to what I believe to be the right way to assess gear - considering both it's offensive and defensive mods.<br>

</div>It's a valid point, but my counterargument would be that while people really *should* look at the buffs page and tune it for themselves, I'm not sure how many people actually do.  I have the perception that a lot of more casual users just open it up, punch in the stuff on the front page, and go never notice or care that there are additional pages.  Hence, to try to give the best possible values for this sort of casual user, it seems like it would be good to have some reasonable selection of raid buffs in.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<!-- message -->
		<div id="post_message_607148"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Ive noticed when playing around with your spreadsheet to try and find a good gear selection, that as soon as you add 1 point into Dirty Deeds (or the full 2) the "Optimal Hit" drops by like, 80 or so points. Given the nature of this talent I find it unlikely this was intentional?<br>
<br>
Tried going back through the thread to the point where you put a note about the introduction of Dirty Deeds into the spreadsheet and found no reasoning for this, so could it be looked into?<br>
<br>
<br>
After playing with the "other" spreadsheet (the DPS one) I kept getting odd results which seemed to indicate that Hemo build would be far superior for my weapons / gear selection to combat (which again, seems a little unlikely?) so gave yours a try, but noticed Dirty Deeds was massively reducing the Optimal Hit.<br>
<br>
Is this due to Hemo not requiring as much hit, due to lack of CP procs, in which case, surely Optimal Hit would drop when selecting Hemo, not Dirty Deeds? (In which case I still find it unlikely that it would suggest losing around 80 Hit rating?)<br>
<br>

		<div id="post_message_607149"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Well, there may be an underlying bug, but my guess is that what is happening is that putting that point in dirty deeds increases the value of agility to be greater than the value of hit; hence, without that point, it recommends socketing with hit, and after that it recommends socketing with agi.<br>
<br>
Note also that you probably have the sheet set on "weighted total" (the default), so that's socketing for a weighted combination of damage and survivability; if you out it on "Offense" you will most likely find that hit is optimal with or without the point in Dirty Deeds.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_607152"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->After a little more testing, It seems that if you have "Spicy Hot Talbulk" set to "yes" in the buffs section, The "Optimal Hit" only drops when Hemo is selected, regardless of Dirty Deeds selection, However..  if you set it to "no", the "Optimal Hit" only drops when Dirty Deeds is selected, regardless of whether you choose Hemo or not.<br>
<br>
Hope that helps shed some light on what might be the issue? (I can understand hit dropping when Hemo is selected, given the lack of hit requirement for CP procs in a Hemo build, but its still dropping by almost 80 rating, is that reasonable?, it was suggesting an "Optimal Hit" of just 216 or so?)<br>

Hmm valid point I guess, just kinda shocked me to see the Optimal Hit drop like a stone when inputting a tri-spec hemo build, Is the hit requirement that much lower, or just the weighting of AGI / AP makes it worth more on the spreadsheet? (Im trying to get a feel of where to stop worrying about hit rating in such a build, given the lack of CP etc... requiring less hit rating and perhaps allowing more atk power orientated stats (AGI mainly) cus both spreadsheets Ive worked with seem to indicate Tri-spec as giving far superior DPS to combat, given my current gear. Unfortunatly armory is down at the moment and Im still screwing with spec's and gems, so I look kinda messed up lol :p<br>
<br>
So to clarify, can anyone give insight a desireable ammount of hit rating for Hemo Tri-spec builds, been trying gem swaps and food swaps etc.. and Ill be damned if I can find the balance :o<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>To repeat what Aldrianna said, check these things first:<br>
1. At the top of the DPS Sheet, under where you select race, you can select an Offensive/Defensive ratio. If yours is set to Weighted Total, you'll sometimes find that due to the dodge and armor bonus of agi, agi is a better socketing option than hit. If you're only concerned about DPS, change it to Offensive.<br>
2. If you don't have Sword spec and/or WF, agi often surpasses hit rating.<br>
<br>
As far as finding that optimal hit level, the spreadsheet is already telling you what you need to do to maximize your DPS. If you configure your buffs and weighting options correctly, the optimal socket suggestions will help you reach your maximum DPS in current gear.<br>
<br>
To once again flesh out what's happening with Optimal Hit: the box is showing you what your hit WOULD be IF you socketed according to the sheet suggestions. Its only purpose is in letting you know whether or not socketing "optimally" will take you over the hit cap. It is not giving you an amount of hit to shoot for, necessarily. The reason Dirty Deeds is dropping your optimal hit rating is because DD increases yellow damage only, which is buffed by agi and not hit. This is causing your socket recommendations to switch from hit to agi, thus dropping the optimal hit value.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
I do realise the main reason for the spreadsheet was to try to indicate when people are over the hitcap, rather than provide them with a "goal" to aim for, in regards to hit, but like Aldrianna says, "Optimal Hit" causes many confusions, it either needs to be renamed to some slightly more accurate description, or hidden totally.<br>
<br>
That said, even taking into account what DD does for yellow attacks, I find it rather odd that with just 1 point in it, the spreadsheet would instantly think its better to go all out for AGI, than hit, which would have resulted in a Hit Rating of around 220, at which point I find it unlikely that the increased AGI would outweight the large ammount of misses your white dmg would be experiencing at that point.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Indeed true, my current gear set makes combat not that viable acording to a few spreadsheet tests Ive ran. Ive got a fair bit of haste going on (from DST and Dragonstrike mainhand), aswell as a decent ammount of armor ignore (WSC, Executioner proc, and serrated blades) and in the DPS sheet at least, Tri-spec comes out the clear winner on the DPS charts for me.<br>
<br>
However finding a balance of hit rating vs AGI (or maybe pure AP, Ive been wondering about the idea of a high armor-ignore, high AP tri-spec for a while) isnt so easy, especially as having decent armor ignore (procs or not) really does boost white dmg, which requires more hit, whereas of course, DD tends to put the imputus (spelling?) on AGI for the extra yellow damage when below the threshold, at least in the spreadsheet.<br>
<br>
If the Armory was working Im sure you guys would see from my current gear-set the predicament Im stuck in at the moment lol <!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

So, the general idea is this. I could try to specify some middle-of-the-road "most people will be about this buffed" setup. This would probably be something like Imp Fort, Imp GotW, Imp Battle Shout, Imp BoMight, Kings, Imp Hunter's Mark, Flask, Talbuk, Str of Earth, Sunders, FF, Mangle, Heroism, and WF/DP. This level of buff is probably pretty similar to what most people have.<br>
<br>
Alternately, I could use what's typical of my guild, which is that plus Solarian's Sapphire, Curse of Recklessness, and Drums (under the assumption that what matters most in terms of maximizing DPS is how you do on progression fights, where popping a Drum every cooldown is totally reasonable - particularly with as cheap as they've gotten).</div>

</div>Perhaps you could put in a section where you fill in your group makeup, and the sheet makes its best guess as to what buffs you get from that?<br>
<br>
You'd have 4 dropdown boxes to fill in the other members of your group, and then a second set of tickboxes to specify other classes in the raid.  Thus you could tell it that your melee group is (Self, Rogue2, Rogue3, DPSwar, Enh shaman), and that the raid as a whole has a moonkin, a feral druid and 3 paladins, and a hunter with improved Mark.<br>
<br>
The sheet would then know to give you shouts, totems, 3 Blessings, Imp FF, Imp Mark and Mangle debuff, but <i>not</i> LoTP.<br>
<br>
For the majority of people, that approach would be more intuitive than memorising the list of buffs provided to the party/raid by every class.  The more technically-minded could always tick a manual override button and set a precise complement of buffs/debuffs.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Using my current template / gear (sword / T5ish) the spreadsheet tells me i have an optimal hit at 271.<br>

		<div id="post_message_607428">I'd recommend reading the preceding page or so of posts, which discuss a very similar issue.  Fundamentally: you passed the breakpoint where hit becomes more important than agility, and so the socketing recommendations all change.  The sheet has no ability to socket your gear as a whole for maximal DPS; it can only look at the situation slot by slot.  Hence, when you reach the point where hit passes agility in terms of quality, all the socketing recommendations change at once, so the optimal socketing of your gear changes as well. This doesn't means that you should start trading out gear or gems to get to that level of hit - there's no such thing as a "magic" or "optimal" amount of hit to wind up with.  Instead, it simply means that, going forward, it's probably worthwhile to socket new pieces of gear in a more hit-heavy fashion than you have in the past.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">In other news, I would like feedback on what people perceive to be "typical raid buffs" for a 25-man raid.  When I initially filled in the raid buffs, I did it based on what was typical for the guild I was in at the time, and haven't really updated it since - despite having changed guilds to one that uses a somewhat different combination of buffs (much more use of Curse of Recklessness, for instance).  So my question is: what buffs do people want to see as the "default" set that the sheet downloads with?  Is there some "typical" set of buffs that it should start with, or should I just update it to what my current guild does and let anyone who wants something different change it?  Thoughts?</div>

</div>Sorry for posting late; I hadn't been able to troll the thread for a few days.  Anyhow, like many of the previous posters, our guild builds a melee group around an enhancement shaman and a dps warrior.  We rarely, if ever, get our feral druid in our group for he is stationed with the tanks for threat generation (not to mention that the druid is also tanking and gets other benefits of that group).  Therefore, we get the Mangle debuff but not Leader of the Pack.  Generally speaking, I do not have to change the buffs page around too much when I download a new version of the spreadsheet but I still double-check it nonetheless, which lends support to the "just turn all options off and let people input their own" suggestion.<br>
<br>
As a side note, we do occasionally raid with a retribution paladin in the melee group (when he raids), which gives us Improved Sanctity Aura (+2% damage) as well as Improved Seal of the Crusader (+3% crit).  In addition, one of our druids is taking a trip up the balance tree, bestowing Improved Faerie Fire upon our bosses.  I believe it is safe to say that we are looking for any reason to keep raids entertaining until Sunwell is released.  Anyway, in the case that the buff sheet ever gets re-written, I'm throwing out a suggestion to include the retribution paladin contributions.  Just another line on a post-it note, at most. </div>

</div>I thought about this approach, but it seems to me that there's enough complexity that it would be challenging to do this well.  I think a better approach might be to group the buffs by class and spec rather than in the sort of ad hoc order they're in right now; so, for instance, if you have an enhancement shaman, you go to the "shaman" section which has all shaman buffs and perhaps some notes of which spec they're associated with.  This will provide some of the guidance you refer to, without needing to ask a laundry list of slightly subtle questions ("how many paladins are in the raid?", "have any of your hunters specced Imp Mark?", "if you have 2 or fewer warlocks, do you have more melee dps or caster dps?")<br>

</div>Ret pallies basically just contribute Imp Sanctity Aura, right?  I suppose it might be worth adding, but as 1) ret pallies are somewhat rare in raiding, and 2) it doesn't change gear ordering in any way whatsoever, it hasn't really been a priority.  All it would do is add a scalar multiple to total DPS, and as DPS estimates aren't the primary function of this sheet I'm less worried about that than I might be.<br>
<br>
I don't know.  I may work it in, or not.  I want to improve the usability of the buffs sheet at some point, and a big part of that will be reducing clutter, so we'll see how it fits in.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I'd recommend reading the preceding page or so of posts, which discuss a very similar issue.  Fundamentally: you passed the breakpoint where hit becomes more important than agility, and so the socketing recommendations all change.  The sheet has no ability to socket your gear as a whole for maximal DPS; it can only look at the situation slot by slot.  Hence, when you reach the point where hit passes agility in terms of quality, all the socketing recommendations change at once, so the optimal socketing of your gear changes as well. This doesn't means that you should start trading out gear or gems to get to that level of hit - there's no such thing as a "magic" or "optimal" amount of hit to wind up with.  Instead, it simply means that, going forward, it's probably worthwhile to socket new pieces of gear in a more hit-heavy fashion than you have in the past.</div>

</div>I understand perfectly the "magical" part commentary. All stats scale with one another and so on ... I was surprised to find that the inflection point was so important a change and i thought it was far from my current gear (since i haven't got hyjal/BT acces yet) which got me curious.<br>
<br>
Guess i'll have to loot a tsunami and play a bit with my gems ...<br>
<br>
Thank you all for your response.</div>

		<div id="post_message_607481">The point is, it's really not an important change.  At that level of gear, Agi and Hit have almost identical benefit.  So when you cross from one side of the line to the other - yes, all the socketing recommendations change, but if you look at the amount of damage you do socketed full agi vs the amount you do socketed full hit the difference between the two will be trivial.  It's not going to make a big difference in your damage either way.  But the fact is, the sheet has to recommend *something* so it recommends socketing with whichever happens to be better - even if it's only by .01 AP.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Ret pallies basically just contribute Imp Sanctity Aura, right?  I suppose it might be worth adding, but as 1) ret pallies are somewhat rare in raiding, and 2) it doesn't change gear ordering in any way whatsoever, it hasn't really been a priority.  All it would do is add a scalar multiple to total DPS, and as DPS estimates aren't the primary function of this sheet I'm less worried about that than I might be.<br>

I don't know.  I may work it in, or not.  I want to improve the usability of the buffs sheet at some point, and a big part of that will be reducing clutter, so we'll see how it fits in.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Q: This sheet gives different answers than the Rogue DPS sheet for the value of item/buff/talent point/whatever X.  What gives?<br>
A: At the risk of sounding like an ass: because this sheet is right and the other is wrong.<br>
<br>
To expand on that a bit: there are a number of modeling differences between this and the Rogue DPS sheet, so they will frequently generate different answers for the value of various pieces of gear.  Thus, they disagree because one is more accurately modeling the effect than the other.  As a general rule, I'm of the opinion that the accuracy of this sheet is higher (although I may be biased - if I didn't believe that, I wouldn't have bothered creating this sheet.)  Ultimately, it's a matter of which sheet you trust more, and that you need to decide for yourself.</div>

</div>I have used both sheets and I trust this one more.  Thus, while I recognize that the primary function of this spreadsheet is to accurately recommend the most optimal pieces of gear, enchantments, and gems, I also pay attention to its recommended energy use cycles as well as its DPS estimate.  Now these last two functions may be secondary but they are indeed useful.  I wonder how many rogues out there compare their actual DPS to theorectical DPS in hopes of finding reasons for deviations and, ultimately, ways to improve their play.  I am making no demands here to be sure; I was simply suggesting that if time and desire ever permit the buff page to be re-designed there are some (albeit rare) buffs that could be included. =)</div>

		<div id="post_message_608383">Right well this is one of the first times I've seriously got into the spreadsheet business and a few things have come up while trying to fill in my gear using the Open Office version of the spreadsheet, and I'm wondering whether it's just OO's buggy nature or a bug in your coding.<br>
<br>
Most important thing is that socket values are displaying as "no" when they are blatantly yes according to my character panel, specifaclly Nyn'Jah's Tabi Boots (Love Blizz's constant play on words xD). I have them socketed with 4agi/6stam and 16ap (I know that's bad practise but I socket to keep them in line with my old gear, at that point I could lose crit but needed alot more ap). Thing is, even though it's shown in the spreadsheet as a red and blue socket, it's ignoring the socket bonus... Same with Grimgrin Faceguard where it's definatly a red/yellow/blue socket and I've put 8hit/8agi/4agi+6stam, but displayed as not filling the socket bonus requirements.<br>
Infact, the only "yes"s I have are Deathmantle Chestguard and Master Asassin Wristguards<br>
<br>
So... just a bug with OO or what?<br>
<br>
Edit: sorry for not reading through the whole topic for a relevant post, but this place already sucks away hours and hours as it is without me meaning to &gt;&lt;<br>
<br>
Oh and also what's C, E and H cells along the top representing? Dps or AEP or what?</div>

		<div id="post_message_608832"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->It does get counted more than once.  Fortunately, it's supposed to be.  Murder double-passes on critical hits.  If you attack a murderable mob (without RED), you will find that your crits do 2.04 times as much damage as your noncrits.  Test it yourself; take off your RED and kick rats in the deeprun tram for a while, and you'll find that your noncrits do 112 damage (110 * 1.02 = 112.2) and your crits do 229 (110 * 1.02 * 2 * 1.02 again = 228.89).  But if you kick something that's not Murderable, or spec out of murder, you'll do the 110/220 you'd expect.  And if you do it *with* RED, you'll find your crits do 2.1 (either 2 + .04 + .6 or 2 * 1.02 * 1.03, hard to say which) times as much as noncrits.<br>
<br>
Long story short: yes, it's counted more than once, and that's by design.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_609507"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->An item with two sockets (yellow and red) has an orange gem in the yellow socket and nothing in the red socket, which means no socket bonus.<br>
<br>
Edit note; Forget me - I confused myself with what was being said.<br>
<br>
Aldriana set out to PROVE that a single gem in an item with two sockets could never activate a socket bonus - and did so.<br>
<br>
Further explanatory edit: An item socket bonus requirements are not met in the same way as meta gem requirements (a total number of gems of colour where one two-colour gem can be counted twice), but on a socket for socket basis. Each socket in the item needs a gem in it that meets the socket requirement, and only if all socket requirements on the item are met individually will the socket bonus be released.<br>
<br>
Thus it is nonsense to state that a single gem in an item with two sockets can activate a socket bonus. With a blue and a red socket a purple gem in either socket will only satisfy the requirement of one socket, not both.<br>
<br>
That said, I think Karmon probably knows how socket bonuses work, but just made his point inelegantly or managed to confuse himself with a stray thought - it is good to dispel the thought before it becomes myth though.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

2. Mongoose vs Executioner which is better for T6 endgame rogue? - Ive read the post on Game Mechanics Mongoose vs Executioner it was made before Zul'Aman was implemented. There dosnt seem to be alot of posts about people who have tested both Recently with endgame gear (rogue) but my thoughts are somewhat puzzled to which is better with my gear/weps or upcoming weapons. On the spreadsheet it says Mongoose is better with Talon &lt; Infamy &lt; s3 slicer then you change to Warglaive and Executioner is suggested. I can see the logic to this and how it "could" be better, now i keep everything the same inspreadsheet and i change to Human which is the expertise racial and it suggests Mongoose is better on Talon &lt; Infamy, but then it switched to Executioner on s3 slicer and warglaive. I can also see the logic behind this but could you explain a little how you came to this or even was it tested ingame or just theory?<br>
<br>
3. Ring Enchant: +2 Weapon Damage  vs +4 all stats Which is better for endgame Rogues? - Roguecraft101 seems to suggest +4 stats is better since it gives 8agility and 8str = 16ap now most rogues in pve will have 2% total agility talent which with 600 agility it will boost it a little more. +2 Damage i see Nihilum rogues using this enchant i asked one why he used it any theory behind it, he simply said because he liked it better and its what you like better. Your spreadsheet shows  stats it better also, but why would these Nihilum rogues(all use swords) use +2 weapon damage there must be some theory behind it, any thoughts on this?<br>
<br>
Get back to me when you can, thanks.<br>

<br>
just wanted to say this is an awesome spreadsheet and thanks for the hard work.<br>
<br>
i seem to be having an issue though with that is calculates my +hit to be 282<br>
<br>
but my hit on my toon in game is stated as being 262. i thought maybe having the 5 points in precision is what effected this so i removed them, but it still stayed at 282.<br>

thanks in advance<br>

<br>
1. What is the difference from "Offensive" and "Weighted Total" on your Spreadsheet?<br>
<br>
2. Mongoose vs Executioner which is better for T6 endgame rogue? - Ive read the post on Game Mechanics Mongoose vs Executioner it was made before Zul'Aman was implemented. There dosnt seem to be alot of posts about people who have tested both Recently with endgame gear (rogue) but my thoughts are somewhat puzzled to which is better with my gear/weps or upcoming weapons. On the spreadsheet it says Mongoose is better with Talon &lt; Infamy &lt; s3 slicer then you change to Warglaive and Executioner is suggested. I can see the logic to this and how it "could" be better, now i keep everything the same inspreadsheet and i change to Human which is the expertise racial and it suggests Mongoose is better on Talon &lt; Infamy, but then it switched to Executioner on s3 slicer and warglaive. I can also see the logic behind this but could you explain a little how you came to this or even was it tested ingame or just theory?<br>
<br>
3. Ring Enchant: +2 Weapon Damage  vs +4 all stats Which is better for endgame Rogues? - Roguecraft101 seems to suggest +4 stats is better since it gives 8agility and 8str = 16ap now most rogues in pve will have 2% total agility talent which with 600 agility it will boost it a little more. +2 Damage i see Nihilum rogues using this enchant i asked one why he used it any theory behind it, he simply said because he liked it better and its what you like better.

</div>First off don't sign your posts, we can all look to the left and see your name.<br>
<br>
1. Offensive calculates only the raw damage the gear will give you, weighted gives some value to the armor and dodge agi gives as well as giving some value to stamina.  I'm not sure the exact numbers but it does not change the numbers very much<br>
<br>
2.  Mongoose and Executioner will be very close in value for most levels of gear, mongoose usually wins out for most rogues.  Executioner will typically win if you have more armor pen, also it scales slightly better as an overall damage increase than mongoose does.  I suspect if you look at the EAP listed for the enchants mongoose and executioner will be close in value for the gear you are looking at.  There was a reasonably large discussion about this in this thread (I think) a while ago, try 5-9 pages back.<br>
<br>
3. Nihilum is not known for ultimate theorycrafting knowledge, they are known for progression.  This is your answer plain and simple.  Everytime someone mentions Nihilum they always are asking why a member is doing something that everyone here says is wrong.  I trust the people here much much more.  I give Nihilum all the respect in the world for the effort they put into the game, however playing alot does not mean you have a better understanding of exactly what is the best and what is not.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

	</tbody></table>
</div>So, the way it works in the spreadsheet is that it computes the uptime of both procs and from there computes the benefit.  The proc rates are a bit off right now, but they're equally off for both so that shouldn't affect the ordering.  In general, as gear improves, Executioner becomes better than Mongoose.  In particular, the more Armor Penetration you have, the more like Executioner is to be superior.<br>
<br>
The offense/weighted distinction is important here, it might be noted; for instance, in my current gear which includes 476 passive Armor Pen and WSC, in terms of weighted total, MH Mongoose is still ahead by about 8 AP.  However, if switched to Offensive, Executioner wins by about 1 AP, as the 6% dodge with 40% uptime is felt to be worth about 9 AP.<br>
<br>
However, there's a bit more to this as well; by default, the sheet is scoring stuff based on a 7700 armor opponent, which, throughout 25-man raid content, is the more common boss armor.  However, particularly at the T6 level, there are a lot of mobs with 6200 armor instead.  So it might additionally be worth looking at the comparison at 6200 armor.  This changes things dramatically; now Executioner wins by 17 AP Offensive and still 8 AP in Weighted Total.  So against high-armor bosses Mongoose might be slightly better, but it's very close and on all the low-armor bosses Executioner is a clear winner, which is why I personally selected Executioner for MH.<br>
<br>
So, basically: depending on how much armor penetration you have, whether you are looking at Weighted Total or Offensive, and how you have boss armor set, when exactly Executioner catches Mongoose varies; however, it is generally  true that as you move towards the best possible itemization (which includes 602 passive armor penetration) Executioner will eventually take the lead.<br>

</div>+4 stats is more damage, and some survivability to boot, for sword rogues.  For dagger rogues you can make more of an argument for +2 damage, but even there I think 4agi is usually superior.  My theory is that the Nihilum rogues don't actually know much about theorycraft, a theory that there is a fair amount of evidence to support.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

First, where can we change the armor value for bosses/mobs?  <br>
<br>
Second, my guild is 5/9BT 5/5 Hyjal, would you recommend setting the boss/mob armor value to 6200 if I am looking for advice from the spreadsheet on the best gear in general for BT/Hyjal (that is, not min/maxing for one boss over another).</div>

		<div id="post_message_610173"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->So, it appears that the forum clock got messed up and then reset about noon today, so let me see if I can clarify the post ordering.  After post 1897, the sequence is:<br>
1902<br>
1904<br>
1905<br>
1898<br>
1899<br>
1900<br>
1901<br>
1903<br>
and the continuing correctly at 1906 and beyond<br>
<br>
Everyone clear?  Good, now answers:<br>
Re: #1899: The ArPen number I was giving was pure passive ArPen, neglecting trinket procs and boss debuffs.  The best way for you to figure this out is really really really just to download the sheet, enter your gear, and figure it out.  At a guess: you have a lot of ArPen, so I would expect Executioner to be better, but I'm really just guessing.  Difference tends to be at most 10 DPS or so either way.<br>
<br>
Re: #1900 part 1: See the Advanced Settings page<br>
Re: #1900 part 2: Your call.  Everything in Hyjal plus Teron, Mother, and Council is 6200.  Basically: about half of T6 is 6200, and the other half is 7700.<br>

According to my 0.9.2 spreadsheet, Muramasa (Optimal Offense score of 1239.4, Optimal Total score of 1252.92) comes out a large ways ahead of the season 3 arena MH sword (Opt. Off. 1185.3, Opt. Tot. 1201.219) but does not near the MH Warglaive (Opt. Off. 1334.9, Opt. Tot. 1350.708).  The Dragonscale-Encrusted Longblade (Opt. Off. 484.11, Opt. Tot. 502.1072) falls short of the Blade of Savagery (Opt. Off. 501.61, Opt. Tot. 511.1141) but settles in as the 3rd best OH sword ahead of the season 3 OH sword (Opt. Off. 456.53, Opt. Tot. 472.424).  I am not sure how to assess the trinkets as proc rates and internal cooldowns are unknown.  Additionally, I did not investigate daggers because they frankly do not interest me -- someone else can do it.<br>

		<div id="post_message_615011"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Yes, the old poison model was overestimating poison damage, so you will notice a slight drop in DPS; how big a drop depends, basically, on how often you hit with the poisoned weapon.  So for me with a 1.4 speed OH and a fair amount of haste, it's only about a 6 DPS drop; with a 1.5 speed OH and fewer haste effects, it will presumably be a bit more.  So a 10 DPS difference sounds totally reasonable to me.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Thanks for all the effort you have put into this spreadsheet, very nice <br>
I'm currently in mh/bt content but having a huge problem - no trinket ever dropped, I mean gruul/ssc/tk, even rumulo's one I have not seen tho done kara like 100+ times. I'm still using <a class="itemlink q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28034" target="_blank">[Hourglass of the Unraveller]</a> and <a class="itemlink q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=29383" target="_blank">[Bloodlust Brooch]</a> :/<br>
So I'm thinking how to improve my trinkets and got to <a class="itemlink q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=31856" target="_blank">[Darkmoon Card: Crusade]</a>. However it is not present in the sheet so I can't compare and barely ever mentioned (except from you for dagger rogue). Can you or someone else give an estimate of how good it can be for combat swords?<br>

1-(1-pm-po)^15   (pm = prob. main hand procs per second; po likewise for offhand)<br>
<br>
Shouldn't that be<br>
1-[(1-pm)*(1-po)]^15 ?<br>
<br>
Edit: for the usual case only MH executioner there is no difference. Only if both hands have executioner (normaly noone should do that) it gives a slight lesser uptime.<br>
But if someone wants to see the effect of Ex/Ex he should get an accurate result <!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Hey Aldriana,<br>
Thanks for all the effort you have put into this spreadsheet, very nice <br>
I'm currently in mh/bt content but having a huge problem - no trinket ever dropped, I mean gruul/ssc/tk, even rumulo's one I have not seen tho done kara like 100+ times. I'm still using <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28034" target="_blank">[Hourglass of the Unraveller]</a> and <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=29383" target="_blank">[Bloodlust Brooch]</a> :/<br>
So I'm thinking how to improve my trinkets and got to <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=31856" target="_blank">[Darkmoon Card: Crusade]</a>. However it is not present in the sheet so I can't compare and barely ever mentioned (except from you for dagger rogue). Can you or someone else give an estimate of how good it can be for combat swords?<br>
Thanks</div>

</div>Actually, it's quite easily modeled. In a tank &amp; spank boss fight, the proc will be up and fully stacked all the time, so it simply equals 120 passive Attack Power. <br>
To add it to the spreadsheet, you go to the Trinkets table (Right click on Talents_Equipment at the bottom left corner, click "Show..." and select "Trinkets") and change one of the Trinkets. For Berserker's Call for example, you'd change the following: <br>
A5 to "Darkmoon Card: Crusade" <br>
K5 to "120"<br>

Re: Darkmoon card... remember, it will NOT always be fully stacked on all fights.  Also, on-use trinkets such as Bloodlust Brooch tend to be worth *slightly* more since you are not using it for 20 seconds every 2 min, but likely slightly more.  For instance on a 5 minute fight, you'll get 3 uses out of it, not 2.5.  Also, you can time the AP boost for things like blade flurry and haste pots since Haste and AP scale quite nicely together.<br>
<br>
For a 3 dps upgrade in the BEST of situations, just keep what you have.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Latito is right about the spreadsheet values.  If you are still working on T5 content I would argue that you'll get more benefit from Mongoose than Executioner.  Double-check what boss armor value you have running in your spreadsheet -- it is likely that it is set to 6200.  If so, try looking at the enchants under 7700 boss armor since a greater proportion of T5 bosses sit at 7700 armor relative to T6 bosses.  Most likely the higher boss armor will nudge Mongoose ahead of Executioner and you won't observe this "indecision."<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_617183"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Is Executioner even worth the hassle?

</div>With my gear (full T6 &amp; S3 Swords) in DPS Spreadsheet Executioner gives lower DPS output than Mongoose, even in optimal fight (CoR + 6200 armor mob). On Gear Spreadsheet Executioner is only better if you have CoR, without it it's worse than Mongoose on 7700 armor mob. Granted, on Gear Spreadsheet when fighting against 6200 armor mob with CoR Executioner pulls 6 DPS lead, but still I don't see it worth to enchant over Mongoose considering Mongoose is always good in every situation + it gives sometimes useful dodge and armor.<br>

Many rogues have somewhat poo-poo'd T5 gear due to the lack of +hit on the pieces, and my hit rating has certainly gone down quite a bit - but my DPS is consistently improving, and I've been very happy with it.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
4pc T4 is a seperate chance to give you an additional combo point, and it can happen independently (you won't notice it), or at the same time as Ruthlessness, giving you TWO combo points (so in this sense it does stack).<br>
<br>
Break 2pc T4 as soon as you can get 4pc T5, or if you can get a few choice items from T5 and perhaps the S3 Hat/Chest (they're both big upgrades to T4 pieces).  For more precise information, consult the spreadsheet.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_617640"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Ok.  Yeah, I actually think not stacking with ruthlessness makes it a little better (as I can occasionally get 2 cps on a finisher, and the not stacking doesn't actually make it less chance to get a cp).  But I can see where the difference in stats, along with a somewhat more reliable rotation might make it worth it.  Tbh, I'm one of those that is very disappointed with the lack of hit on t5, but I think at this point that I have enough other gear with hit on it to make up for the lack.  E.g. Nynjah's Tabi Boots, wsc, drape of dark reavers, belt of deep shadow (2 rigid dawnstones), etc.  Well, at least I can be happy that I don't look like a retarded bird anymore.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Personal preferences - I think an enhancement shaman is a pretty good bet for most people in progressive groups.  Also, I'm not sure Improved Hunter's Mark is really that common - it's a very small buff (like what, 110 AP?) for 5 points that the hunter can spend on a better talent at that point in the tree.  I know our hunters don't have it, and 2 of them are very min/max-y.</div>

</div>Agreed, 110 AP is a nice buff for all melee dps.  Unfortunately, it comes at the cost of a Hunter's Efficiency talent - reduced mana cost on all their shots.  The debate on hunters needing this talent definitely depends on the hunter getting BoW (a 3rd or 4th choice pally blessing), having JoW on the boss, having a shadow priest and the hunter using mana pots of some sort.  If the hunter isn't struggling for mana, imp Hunter Mark is nice.. but usually the hunter is more concerned (often rightfully so) about his/her own mana.  The more annoying issue is varying boss fight lengths.  While efficiency might not be needed at all on Teron or Kazrogal or any of the other similarly short fights... mana is certainly going to be a bigger issue on a longer fight like Council or Illidan.<br>
<br>
The right answer depends a lot on what sort of mana-providing buffs your hunter(s) get and how much melee dps your raid has.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_618021"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Agreed, it does definitely come at a cost; but here's the way I'd look at it:<br>
<br>
Say you have 4 melee DPS in the raid, which strikes me as pretty common.  Then the total amount of AP added to the raid by imp mark is about 440 AP; hence, Imp Mark effectively adds 88 AP to the raid per point.  And I'm willing to bet that if hunters had a choice between an 88 AP personal AP talent and... whatever there other options might be, most of them would find a way to work in the 88 AP talent.  Even if it means getting Wisdom instead of Might, it's still worth it, since the total AP added to the raid is twice as large.<br>
<br>
It's sort of like Solarian's Sapphire; if you think of it as adding 70 AP to the warrior himself, it's not that impressive; but when you think of it as adding 70 AP to each of 5 people for an effective benefit of 350 AP, you realize it's the best DPS warrior trinket in the game (for raiding).<br>
<br>
The problem is, of course, that not everyone is good at thinking in terms of maximal raid benefit; not everyone is willing to deal with a personal DPS drop, even if it's matched 2-3 times over by an increase of raid DPS.  And I think this is why many hunters don't get it, because it's hard to argue that it isn't worth it from a raid perspective.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_618273"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Short answer: Helm and... um, something else.<br>
<br>
Long answer:  It sort of depends on your drop luck.  Lets take a look at the items in question for a moment:<br>
<br>
Netherblade Facemask has no significant upgrade before Vashj (unless you're an engineer) at which point it's beaten by about 40 AP by Deathmantle Helm.<br>
<br>
Netherblade Shoulderpads are beaten fairly handily by drops off Hydross (Shoulderpads of the Stranger, 40 AP) and Void Reaver (Deathmantle Shoulderpads, 25 AP)<br>
<br>
Netherblade Chest is beaten by about 35 AP by Bloodsea Brigand's Vest off of Karathress, or about 20 AP by Shadowtooth Troll Cuirass in ZA.<br>
<br>
Netherblade Gloves are beaten by... a lot of things, but if you're looking for things that beat them significantly (10+ AP) you're looking at Trickster's Stickyfingers (30 AP), Gloves of the Searing Grip off Al'ar (35 AP), and Deathmantle Handguards off Leo (55 AP).<br>
<br>
Netherblade Pants are beaten by Shallow-Grave Trousers, Skulker's Greaves, and Deathmantle Legs (from Karathress), all by about 15 AP.<br>
<br>
So, the helm is the best until end T5, and is thus a pretty good choice.  Among the other slots: there are several significant shoulder upgrades in early T5, so they tend to get replaced in a fairly timely fashion, so are probably not a good choice.  Gloves have a decent upgrade already available to you, but if you opt not to go that route it will be fairly late T5 before you have something better... but it's a *lot* better.  Legs have many viable alternatives, including one you already have - but none of them are particularly large upgrades.  And Chest has a couple of fairly moderate upgrades, but which one you can get will be fairly luck-dependent (as, not being tier pieces, whether or not you get them is pretty hit or miss).<br>
<br>
So, my general approach would be: in T5 content, you generally want to work towards Bloodsea Brigand Vest or Shoulderpads of the Stranger, and wear T5 pieces in the other 4 slots.  Hence, which two pieces of T4 you will use the longst has the most to do with which pieces of T5 take you the longest to get.  So see what drops, see what you can get, and keep whichever you need to in order to continue your gear improvement.  Helm will probably be the last thing you replace, but the others really can happen in any order.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_618361"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Speaking of Shoulderpads of the Stranger, I just got them myself, and I would be replacing T4 (and breaking the 2pc set bonus in doing so). I know what the spreadsheet says (in fact, it only has my dps going down by about 1.5-3 or so), but I want to know what other well geared/skilled rogues would do in my position. I can sub back in the T4 legs that I haven't DE'd yet, I just recently got the badge pants with haste on them. Either way, it feels like I'm downgrading to keep either piece of T4. <br>
<br>
If it matters, I'm not using the most current version of the spreadsheet (I think I'm about 1-2 updates behind), but as soon as our raid ends I plan to d/l it and plug everything in to compare.<br>
<br>
Edit: Even after rearranging a bunch of buffs to see if it had an effect on the difference, the rough DPS line never drops my total dps more than 1.5 if I break the T4 bonus with those shoulders. I'm leaning heavily towards booting those HKM ones into a couple voids; any reason not to?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Well I punched in some t5-level gear and while it was worth using t4 helm+t4 pants over t4+shallow-grave the difference was a mere 8 dps. <br>
Switching T4 helm to Vengeful Gladiator's (most easily accessible upgrade at that point of progress) and T4 pants to Shallow-Grave Trousers was a overall 4dps upgrade from t4 2pc. <br>
<br>
I would pick up Vengeful helm asap, since I never like to rely on set bonuses.<br>
<br>
Edit: I just noticed that you had Vengeful MH meaning that you're probably saving points to get the OH and aren't in a position to get Helm within 2-3 weeks yet. In this case I'd stick with T4 Helm/Legs since they are really solid. <br>
<br>
On a interesting note: upgrading from Offset (Vengeful Helm, Strangepad, Trickster's, Shallow-grave) to T5 4pc is only a 24 dps upgrade. <br>
Considering that Rogues will need to compete with Mages for t6 (whom most can bypass taking t4-t5 gear by using crafted) it's probably better to not go for t5 set. DKP wise. <br>
Then again it's a question on how fast you are progressing as well. <br>
I would try to pick-up Bloodsea Brigand's Vest, Belt of Deep-Shadow, Ring of Lethality, Arcanite Steam-Pistol in that order.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Considering that Rogues will need to compete with Mages for t6 (whom most can bypass taking t4-t5 gear by using crafted) it's probably better to not go for t5 set. DKP wise. <br>
Then again it's a question on how fast you are progressing as well. <br>
I would try to pick-up Bloodsea Brigand's Vest, Belt of Deep-Shadow, Ring of Lethality, Arcanite Steam-Pistol in that order.</div>

</div>Thanks for the responses. First, to Vulajin, the reason I asked, even knowing there's a spreadsheet and using it, is because it is such a minor difference, and there are so many non-gear variables. I clicked over to the buff tab, and I just went down the list, but there's only a few things that I ALWAYS have; most of the time it's a 50/50 chance I'll get a warrior in my group, or a feral druid, or a marks hunter, or a ret pally, or some combination. And instead of plugging ALL those variables around for something which only comes to a 1.5dps difference in what I had initially selected, I wanted to see what people had to say on the subject.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I have the belt already (my armory is updated to show me in my raid gear now), but I was thinking of trying to save my DKP for the vest. When the shoulders dropped, though, I didn't want to let them rot (no one else wanted them), so I figured I'd take the hit and get the chest some other time. And as for progression, we're doing pretty well recently. Went from Lurker/Tidewalker and VR down to 5/6 and 2/4 (working on Solarian this weekend in between Vashj attempts I think) in two weeks. <br>
<br>
I'll have to plug around the s3 helm, even though it'll be a few weeks until I can get it. I just figured I'd have to get the T5 helm to get an upgrade; I didn't think the pvp one would be that strong in PvE.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_618711"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Heh, I'm reading this and my guild is in a similar progression to yours, and I'm in almost the same spot as you.  Haven't got the shoulders yet (lost the roll) but am hoping to get some significant upgrades over the next couple weeks.  About the s3 helm - I assume you have RED in your t4.  I have that, but then put the +18 sta / 5% stun resist meta in my s3, so it's actually a significant loss over the t4.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_619193"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I had the same problem as the past few rogues who posted about T4 and T5 with off pieces. I got S3 helm and socketed RED along with shallow-grave pants. I use T4 chest and T4 gloves to keep the 2pc bonus. This leaves me open on shoulders since T5 and Strangers can be gotten around the same time. I am saving DKP by not getting the strangers and then getting T5, even though they are a downgrade. Right now im using Dancing Blades until T5 (which is a side grade) but once im at T5 4pc bonus, it will all work out (helm/shoulderpads/gloves/pants) and will jump DPS up considerable. <br>
<br>
Just keep playing with the spreadsheet by using not just gear you will get in the near future BUT also with gear further down the line. This will give you options on how to use your DKP more wisely. In the end of SSC/TK, having 4 pc T5 with Bloodsea chest is what we should try and attain.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Depending on your guild and whether you plan to move into T6 in the future, I would rearrange that.  Arcanite Steam-Pistol is best in slot (including all of T6), I would also put the Vashj belt in there since it is also best in slot.  The vest is nice, but the one off Supremus is better, and Ring of Lethality won't be replaced until Illidan.<br>

Planning for the 4 piece T5 unless you are stuck in T5 content is something I never personally did because you will maintain it for a very short period, thus you will pick up at least 2 items that are sidegrades, that you can only use while you have all 4, and as soon as you get an upgrade you loose the benefit.

</div>Going by this advice, according to the spreadsheet- right now im at 1328 DPS, with your suggested gear it would be 1395, with same suggested gear but plugging in T5 pieces minus chest (bloodsea) it would be 1415. So basically 20 extra DPS for going from picking up 8 pieces to 10 pieces.<br>
<br>
At moment-<br>
Helm- S3<br>
Neck- Worgan Claw<br>
Shoulders- Dancing Blades<br>
Back- Drape of Dark Reavers<br>
chest- T4<br>
Bracers- Master Assassin<br>
Gloves- T4<br>
Belt- Deep Shadow<br>
Legs- Shallow-grave<br>
Boots- Nyn'jah's<br>
Ring- 1000 marks/Garona's<br>
Trinket- Bloodlust/Dragonspine<br>
Weapons- S2/S2<br>
<br>
What I was planning-<br>
Helm- T5<br>
Neck- Worgan Claw<br>
Shoulders- T5<br>
Back- Drape of Dark Reavers<br>
Chest- Bloodsea<br>
Bracers- Master Assassin<br>
Gloves- T5<br>
Belt- 1000 deaths<br>
Legs- T5<br>
Boots- Nyn'jah's<br>
Ring- Ring of Lethality/Ranger General<br>
Trinket- Warpcoil/Dragonspine<br>
Weapons- Talon/S2<br>
<br>
Which amounts to like 785 DKP (Zero-sum) spent to get it all, where as I would spend 580 DKP to be on par with the suggested pieces (205 DKP for extra 20 DPS gah!) I could also make a case for keeping Dancing Blades over Shoulderpads of the Stranger (10 DPS upgrade) to save 75 DKP by going with the suggested pieces. Thanks a lot for the suggestion Hanos!<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_619523"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Expertise and Hit are both good mods.  The fundamental issue is that it that it's itemized too strongly into stamina, and is thus missing other useful, good mods like Agility and Attack Power.  It's not that Expertise isn't good - it is.  It just costs you too much to get.<br>
<br>
Shadowpanther scores it highly for PvE, but their "PvE" weighting includes a very large weighting for stamina - almost twice the "Weighted Total" option in this sheet (which most people seem not to use anyway, under the philosophy that even it it giving too much weight to Stamina).  So it - and all other high-sta gear - is dramatically overvalued by the "PvE" column of Shadowpanther, which is why it disagrees.  So if you really, really, *really* like stamina you can make a case for Deftness; but most rogues seem to prefer a somewhat more moderate amount of Stamina, and for rogues in that position Choker of Vile Intent is superior by a fair margin.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>The difference on SP.net is only 5 DAEP, and that's because the Brooch of Deftness has tons of Stam, which is given a fair bit of weight by the metric.  You'll notice the on the Max DPS rating the Choker of Vile Intent comes out way ahead.  From what I know of rogues (disclaimer: my rogue is a Kara-geared Mutilate rogue) expertise is a solid stat for rogues, but when you weigh 4 hit rating and 21 expertise rating against 20 agility and 42 AP....it should be obvious at a glance that Vile Intent is going to come out on top.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>If you are going to use it to compare gear at a glance for maximising dps you'll need to use the MAEP column. If you wish to go into deeper theorycrafting taking into account talents and synergy's between items then use Aldriana's excellent Rogue Gear Spreadsheet. I used Shadowpanther until I found it.<br>

</div>Ah, sorry about that.  One thing that is confusing me is that today when I looked at the spreadsheet it was telling me to put all 8 agi gems in my gear, and the optimal hit is at 295, whereas a couple days ago it was hit gems, and optimal hit was somewhere around 360.  All I've been doing is switching in and out upgrades to see the changes in rough dps.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_621075"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Also answered in this thread, not even that many pages back.  If hit is .01 better than agility, it's going to tell you to gem all +8 hit (for that .08), but if a gear change makes agility .01 than hit, suddenly it'll tell you to drop all your hit gems for +8 agi (or +4/+4s).  <br>

</div>Agreed; this is my recommended approach as well.  I believe the crossover point for most rogues is that any fight with more than 2 seconds of movement each minute favors Cat's Swiftness over 12 agi, which includes, um, just about everything in T5 with the possible exception of Void Reaver, plus about half of the fights in T6.  So I believe the endgame optimal thing to do is have a set of Nyn'jah Tabi boots socketed for hit with 12 agi to use for sustained fights, and a set of Shadowmaster's Boots socketed more towards agi with Cat's Swiftness to use on movement fights.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Well, let's see.  With the gear in your armor and the default suite of raid buffs, I show your trinket upgrades as:<br>
Dragonspine Trophy: 102.4<br>
Madness of the Betrayer: 52.8<br>
Ashtongue Talisman of Lethality: 48.8<br>
Berserker's Call: 31.7<br>
Tsunami Talisman: 20.9<br>
<br>
So, in terms of a raid-buffed scenario, I'm not seeing what you're referring to.<br>
<br>
If, on the other hand, we look at the totally unbuffed situation, we have:<br>
<br>
Dragonspine Trophy: 58.5<br>
Berserker's Call: 49.4<br>
Madness of the Betrayer: 36.6<br>
Ashtongue Talisman: 28.6<br>
Tsunami Talisman: 21.0<br>
<br>
So, yes, if we're talking totally unbuffed, Berserker's Call competes with Dragonspine Trophy.  This is, for instance, why a lot of people like it as a PvP trinket.  But from a raiding persepctive - how often do you raid totally unbuffed?  Even putting on an absolutely minimal set of buffs (PW:Fort, GotW, Blessing of Might, 5xSunders, Faerie Fire, IP MH, DP OH - which is fewer buffs than any rogue in a 25-man raid should have), we have:<br>
<br>
Dragonspine Trophy: 64.5<br>
Madness of the Betrayer: 32.4<br>
Berserker's Call: 31.7<br>
Ashtongue Talisman of Lethality: 21.5<br>
Tsunami Talisman: 11.5<br>
<br>
So, fundamentally: AP is good in low-buff situations, hence if you are unbuffed or only very lightly buffs, Berserker's Call is a reasonably strong trinket.  But in most 25-man raids you will have enough buffs that Dragonspine Trophy will be markedly superior, Berserker's Call will rank no higher than 3rd.<br>

</div>I probably would, yeah.  I mean, lets look at the fights in T5 where Cat's Swiftness will either a) deal more damage or b) cause you to take less damage than 12 agi:<br>
<br>
Hydross<br>
Lurker<br>
possibly Tidewalker (depending on graves)<br>
Karathress<br>
Leotharas<br>
Vashj<br>
<br>
Al'ar<br>
possibly Void Reaver (depending on strategy)<br>
Solarian<br>
Kael<br>
<br>
You might note that I just listed every single boss in T5.  Even removing the debatable ones, it's still 8 out of 10.  So yes, as a T5 rogue, I would say Cat's Swiftness is usually superior.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_622326"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Fundamentally, not everyone needs money very badly these days.  I mean, once you buy your epic mount and some 20-slot bags, what else is there to spend money on?  Repairs cost some, but as a rogue you can farm enough to cover that in, like, half an hour a night, tops.  So I can definitely see rogues that don't feel the need to sell nethers for cash, and given the number of badges you can get from a Karazhan run it's quite easy to get 60 badges for an extra pair of Nynjah Tabis.  The principal reason I haven't done so myself is because I don't think I'd be able to get epic gems to put in them.  But if you're at T5 level and just gemming with blue gems anyway, I could definitely see doing this.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_622399"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I guess that it depends on your server and your willingness to farm.  Personally, even running Kara twice for a total of 8 hours (or even 6 if you got an all mains run) is more than I'd be willing to put in for 6 extra agil, which works out to 1-2 DPS out of 1300?  (I'm at work so I can't check)  <br>
<br>
If that is the last upgrade that is possibly available and you are a hardcore min/maxer, go for it.  <br>
<br>
Just to throw something else out there though, depending on whether you have any guilds on your server clearing BT past Mother Sharaz and thus might have some extra Heart of Darkness to sell, the upgrade from a T5 level peice to the Swiftstrike Bracers or Swiftstrike Shoulders is a pretty nice one, even after the haste nerf.  So if I was in T5 and wanted to max out my gear, I'd rather put the 8 hours towards farming/doing dailies and/or the 60 badges towards selling nethers and then buy one or both of the swiftstrike items (On my server you can get the HoD from 500g to 1000g each depending on what you work out).  But again, everyone has different amounts of gold and likes different aspects of the game more than others, so that's just my prediliction, I really don't get much enjoyment out of Kara anymore, even to the extent that I'd rather just grind primal mana sometimes, so...<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_623905"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Hello everyone, I have been reading the various theorycrafting posts and playing around with the spreadsheet for a while. However, some questions arised. While I do try to follow the dps rotation at my best (that in my case is 3.8s5r) I find my DPS being really really low.<br>
 In instance the last gruul I killed saw me sitting around 730-750 dps while the spreadsheet estimates 1003 rough dps. Now I know that i don't blindly have to follow the value the spreadsheet provides, since the various mechanics of the encounters. But isn't the difference between the estimated and the actual dps way off?<br>
My group was composed by me, another rogue 2 hunters (one of them being BM the other one MM) and an enh shaman (he was using grace of air instead of WF due to the hunters), so for what it counts I even had stormstrike up on gruul most of the time that gave me a bit more damage with the poisons.<br>
Speaking with rogues that plays in more advanced progression-wise they told me that for my gear level the DPS is indeed way too low. <br>
The Spreadsheet, tells me that I actually even more hit than required (225 without hot spicy talbuk) and i should downgrade to 204. Now, I must admit that I am puzzled about this, according to recount 8% of my white attacks missed him (with 245 hit). The suggestion the spreadsheet gives me here would be socketing all my slots with delicate living rubys (8 agi) and just a slot with a glinting noble topaz (using the s1 chest), but doing so will make me lose the RED bonus, would the increase of agi would be worth even the loss of the RED bonus?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_623909"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->An important thing to remember about Gruul is that you're not getting full time on target.  You're spending a good 15% of your time out of melee range on account of shatters and dodging caveins; as such, if your sustained DPS prediction from the spreadsheet is 1000, it's not reasonably to expect to do consistently over 850 on Gruul.  So your damage is perhaps a bit low, but not totally out of the question.<br>
<br>
Regarding the rest: the spreadsheet does not take metagem activation into account when recommending gear.  It's just doing piece-by-piece best socketing.  So yes, you are going to need to deviate from the socketing recommendations in order to keep your metagem active.  All it's really telling you is that, at the moment, it think agi is a better stat for you than hit.  Now, the two are pretty close together so it's likely not worth resocketing anything you already have; but you might consider socketing new gear you get with more agi and less hit.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
The DPS you see is indeed quite low. It could be down to inexperience on the fight though. Losing that much DPS while following the correct dps cycles I would pressume you're maybe not CloSing the  slams and repositioning?<br>
<br>
Some guilds may use different tactics... Some like to send melee behind the rocks to avoid the slam altogether, are you doing this? All sorts of moments where you aren't actually in melee range could acount for the DPS loss. Individually they may not be great losses but combined, it could add up.<br>

</div>Yes, I did use the offensive mode.<br>
<br>
Regarding the positioning, obviously I cos out the gronn lord grasp but not always i am able to get back to him right after. Experience-wise, I do lack it as rogue that's another point too. For the dps cycle I usually build my first CP with SS then SnD get to 3 CP refresh SnD and build 5 cp for rupture. But I have to say that for the moment I struggle sometimes to keep this up (it's really about my "luck" with CP procs). So I guess on the next try I will try and lower my rotation to 3s/3r and check if I see any improvements. Also using stuff like trinkets and bf together, and in case AR is up to use trinkets bf and AR at once (not before having checked to have 80 or more energy before i use AR).Thanks very much for all the answers<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Speaking with rogues that plays in more advanced progression-wise they told me that for my gear level the DPS is indeed way too low. <br>
The Spreadsheet, tells me that I actually even more hit than required (225 without hot spicy talbuk) and i should downgrade to 204. Now, I must admit that I am puzzled about this, according to recount 8% of my white attacks missed him (with 245 hit). The suggestion the spreadsheet gives me here would be socketing all my slots with delicate living rubys (8 agi) and just a slot with a glinting noble topaz (using the s1 chest), but doing so will make me lose the RED bonus, would the increase of agi would be worth even the loss of the RED bonus?</div>

</div>On fights like Gruul (or Leotheras) , you have to use your combo points a bit differently because of your energy caping during the shatter. For example you should have 1 combo point ( or more depending on your cycle) unspent during the shatter, you spend it while you run back to Gruul so you have SnD up all time while on gruul.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Regarding the positioning, obviously I cos out the gronn lord grasp but not always i am able to get back to him right after. Experience-wise, I do lack it as rogue that's another point too. For the dps cycle I usually build my first CP with SS then SnD get to 3 CP refresh SnD and build 5 cp for rupture. But I have to say that for the moment I struggle sometimes to keep this up (it's really about my "luck" with CP procs). So I guess on the next try I will try and lower my rotation to 3s/3r and check if I see any improvements. Also using stuff like trinkets and bf together, and in case AR is up to use trinkets bf and AR at once (not before having checked to have 80 or more energy before i use AR).Thanks very much for all the answers</div>

</div>In my opinion, you'll do better to loosen your cycle to 4s/5r or 5s/5r rather than lower it to 3s/3r. The longer cycle will give a more efficient return from Relentless Strikes. Most models show the longer cycle as better DPS, and most posters here find it easier to maintain as well. I, personally, run a 2s/5r cycle, but if I get unlucky with combo points I usually do something like the following to get back on track:<br>
<br>
2s, (get unlucky with CP procs), 4r, 2s, 5r<br>
or<br>
2s, (get unlucky with CP procs), 5r, 1s, 4r, 2s, 5r<br>
<br>
Cut where you can on Rupture in order to keep SnD up, but in general try to build to higher CP levels before dropping finishers.<br>
<br>
All in all, however, Gruul is not a good fight to benchmark your DPS on. There is a lot of movement, as well as a lot of turning and potential parries. (You should always try to stay behind Gruul, but sometimes the tanks have to move him to get out of a cave-in or something similar, and you will be DPSing from the front momentarily. This can have a significant impact on DPS.)<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_624789"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Adding new cycles is reasonably hard in general, although working off the existing sheets would probably rein in the difficulty somewhat - I honestly haven't given a lot of thought to it.  However, in the specific case of XsYr for X or Y constant (i.e. 2sXr, Xs4r) it's actually reasonably managable.<br>
<br>
If you just want to play with it a bit, the easiest way is to replace either the 1sXr or 5sXr sheet.  Row 84 on either calc sheet specifies the SnD size to use (in fact, the value of row 84 is the *only* difference between the 1sXr and 5sXr sheets).  So if you change that row to a 2, that sheet will now display values for 2sXr instead of whichever it did before.  You may also then want to change the value of DamageCalcs.G14 (or G15, as appropriate) to get the correct cycle name for the cycle recommendation.<br>
<br>
Now, if you wanted to actually add 2sXr to the sheet in a general way, you would want to make a copy of either the 1sXr or 5sXr page, change row 84 to 2, and then wire it up to the DamageCalcs page by adding another row in both the top and bottom blocks and copying in the formulas.  This is a little messier, but not totally intractable.<br>
<br>
Now, regarding the general question of the merits of a 2sXr cycle: last summer when I was working on this I spent a great deal of time analyzing theoretical cycles and concluded that the optimal XsYr cycle should, in general, fall in one of the 4 families that I have included in the sheet.  I'm not going to swear that I didn't make a mistake, and I definitely did make some simplifying assumptions such that even if my logic was sound, the assumptions may skew the result... but, fundamentally, it is my believe that the only circumstance in which 2sXr can be optimal is when X = 5, and the resulting 2s5r cycle coincides with the Xs5r cycle.  Unfortunately it's been 7 months since I made that analysis, and I recall it being messy to show, so I can't really show the proof of it, but that is my recollection.<br>
<br>
That said: by all means, feel free to go ahead and play around with them a bit and see what you come up with; but fundamentally, I will be surprised if you find that a 2sXr cycle surpasses the existing ones, and even more so if it does so by a nontrivial amount.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_626111"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->This might be a bit off topic, but the thread is about gear so here goes.  What have people that have made it up to Mother Sharaz done for their SR set?  At the moment my guild is just starting on her, so we have a shortage of HoD to make the SR epics.  I've gotten to the 295 unbuffed cap by using: <br>

<br>
(not enough HoD to get 3 for the epic legs)<br>
<br>
It seems to me that losing the meta gem slot for the head in particular is something that I should look at replacing asap.  Do people have any other recommendations?  <br>
<br>
My first though when looking at the gear is that your max DPS is probably giong to be the full epic SR set which gets you to the cap no problem, then enchanting everything with your normal DPS enchants.  E.g. +12 agil to cloak instead of SR, a nethercobra patch on the epic SR legs, etc.  <br>
<br>
However, I haven't considered every available option, has anyone figured out whether a green plus enchants might be better in one slot because it allows you to keep a regular DPS item in another slot?  <br>
<br>
That is, we normally look at gear upgrades on a slot by slot basis (exchanging one wrist peice for another) but this situation requires you to compare the DPS lost by replacing, for example, DPS legs with SR legs and gaining a DPS helm + enchants vs. Keeping DPS legs, but losing the DPS helm with a meta socket VS a second teir DPS helm with the 20 SR glyph and enchanting all other available slots with 8SR patches, SR to cloak and maybe even void spheres in some slots.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_626141"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Well, I confess that I haven't done any profound analysis if the situation, but my suspicion is that what one finds in terms of optimizing ones SR set is that wearing the 5 crafted pieces (cloak, bracers, belt, legs, boots) with DPS enchants on all of those is the way to go, as that brings you to a total of 300 SR (which, with Prayer of Shadow Protection, gets you to the SR cap).  Those pieces all give large amounts of SR, and I suspect you find it's more efficient to get the SR that way than by using SR enchants or Void Crystals (efficient in the sense of costing less DPS stats to get).  You can then wear regular DPS pieces in all other slots - such as, in the ideal case, 4/5 T6 (all but the legs).<br>
<br>
In terms of optimizing without the legs: I'd punch in your regular gear and write down the score for each item you're currently using, and then compare that to the amount of SR you get from that slot, thus allowing you to figure out which slots have the best DPS stats-for-SR tradeoff.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_626188"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->From a guild's logistical standpoint, the legs are a huge waste of hearts, and you also give up a <i>lot</i> of DPS stats from your legs. Gearing a single 25-man raid takes 225 hearts if you use the legs, 150 otherwise.<br>
<br>
The best slots to replace for SR, aside from the crafted cloak/bracers/belt/boots, would be rings. Try to find "of Shadow Protection" rings adding up to at least 32 SR, and make sure you wear an old helmet with <a class="q2" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=29199" target="_blank">[Glyph of Shadow Warding]</a> on it, plus the +15 SR enchant on your crafted cloak.

				<div style="font-style:italic">From a guild's logistical standpoint, the legs are a huge waste of hearts, and you also give up a <i>lot</i> of DPS stats from your legs. Gearing a single 25-man raid takes 225 hearts if you use the legs, 150 otherwise.</div>

</div>While it's true that the legs are the least efficient slot for SR from a hearts perspective, they are only marginally so; belt and boots only give 27 SR per heart, compared to 24 for legs.

				<div style="font-style:italic">Well something you should always be aware of is, you should gem conciously when in t6 content. This means for a rogue, put as much hit on the slots you don't replace with shadow resist gear, make sure your meta gem requirements are met when wearing shadow resist gear. Your fancy meta does nothing for you if you lack a red/blue gem. And you probably will want to wear t6 head over Cursed Vision of Sargeras to make the set bonus.</div>

</div>Agreed.  This is, for instance, one of the reasons I have by blue gems in shoulders and chest, even though, from a straight optimization standpoint, I would do slightly more damage by having the 2nd blue gem in boots or belt rather than shoulders.<br>
<br>
Of course, if you're just doing Mother for the first time, this sort of consideration isn't quite such a big deal, as you clearly don't have T6 shoulders or chest, nor Cursed Vision.  But that's definitely the direction you want to be heading.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>True enough, though I'd expect that the boots and belt also offer a superior ratio of SR gained to DPS lost than the legs. As well, I'd expect that all the epic crafted SR pieces offer a far superior ratio of SR gained to DPS lost than any green "of Shadow Protection" pieces.<br>

</div>Hmm, you're logged out in pvp gear on the armory, but the ZA cloak is almost as good as teron's but with the lack of hit.<br>
Best would be to pickup a secondary sets of various items (Shadowmaster's, any t6 piece.) or simply regem. I personally try to not go over 300'ish since at that point agility is quite close in value to hit.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_630351"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Hello, im a first time poster, reader since some time ago.<br>
<br>
I finally took the time to use the spreadsheet and im having some gemming thoughts. It seems it wants me to stock up alot on +8 hit gems, instead of the 4 hit 4 agi im using now. Also I had to put in a fake helm since I got the second sight one still (extremely bad luck with the drops, exalted with kara, NO rogue token for either gloves or helm  ).<br>
<br>
I'm currently at 275 hitrating, and guild is at Vashj atm progresswise. I could use some pointers on how to increase the DPS, cause I've been playing rogue for a longtime and I think I've become a bit "homeblind" so to say. Currently I always aim for getting 3pt SnD up, go for 5pt SnD and then 5p Rupture. From what I've read this is a tad old cycle and I would love to start with a new one.<br>
<br>
Also I just went from fist to sword specc, hence my fist offhand.<br>
But what I'm wondering is, should I put in more +8 hitrating or keep the 4hit4agi ones?<br>

		<div id="post_message_630364"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Well, in general, 8 hit will be more sustained damage; however, on interrupted fights it's actually pretty close; additionally, the agility gives you some dodge (which isn't useless).  So you can argue that hit gems are better, but it's definitely  debatable and fight-dependent.<br>
<br>
Also, even if you believe the hit gems are better, the DPS difference in switching from glinting to rigid is usually on the order of half a DPS each.  So swapping out every single one you have would be, like, a half a percent damage increase.  Given which, I wouldn't spend a lot of time worrying about resocketing what you're already wearing... thought it may or may not make sense to socket more for hit going forward.<br>
<br>
Also, you might think about Helm of the Claw instead of Second Sight - it's better, thanks to the meta socket.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_632381"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I've been reading and using the spreadsheets here for quite some time and would like to say thanks for all of the great help. I'm currently working on my second rogue amd he is at a relatively low gear level. I have 240 hit rating, 1460 AP, and 23% crit unbuffed. I'm currently specced 20/41/0 for raid dps although I have yet to step foot into Kara on this rogue and I have a question about gemming.<br>
<br>
Despite the common consesus that I should gem for hit rating since I am nowhere near the hit cap when I use the spreadsheet to fool around with my gems and such I always end up with a higher dps when I use gems that give agi over hit (ie 4hit/4agi over 8 hit, or 8 agi over 8 hit where socket bonus is irrelevant to dps) and I can't seem to figure out why. Granted they are minor dps changes, but nonetheless if I want to maximize my dps I want to understand why the agi gems are coming out on top. For raid buffs I was conservative and used Kings, Might, Spicy Hot Talbuk(which coincedentally comes out lower than 20 agi food), GotW, and Sunderx5. InstantMH/DeadlyOH. Am I missing something or is it just that agi is better at low gear levels?<br>
<br>
Also I am using Rogue_Gear_0_9_2_00 for my calculations, as I am almost certain it is the most accurate and current. Any insight would be greatly appreciated.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Kinda.   Hit scales up faster with the more buffs you have.  Particularly something like Windfury.   In an unbuffed situation agil usually is better than hit.   In a fully 25 man raid buff situation, usually hit becomes better than agil (til cap).   Also make sure you're looking at offensive instead of weighted if you want to see the max dps thing.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I've been looking around and unable to find any information on the trinkets in sunwell now proven to be real, I find that suprising.  Has any attempt been made to estimate their ap value given average trinket PPM and CD's?  The passive stats on each trinket both seemed to add up to around 120ap for me, but the spreadsheet confuses me too much to try and estimate the procs.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>Well, personally, I'm still a bit skeptical about the items listed for Sunwell, if for no other reason than because they're *ridiculously* expertise heavy.  Shard of Contempt, for instance, puts any combat rogue at the Expertise cap by itself, meaning that if you have any other Expertise gear at all (notably the Vashj belt or the Sunwell OH Sword) you're now well over the expertise cap.  It'd be sort of like the situation way back when in MC days when there was lots of itemization for hit but we couldn't reduce miss rate under 19%.  Expertise is a great stat, but if they actually release this much Expertise gear we'll all be desperately finding ways to dump it because it'll be useless after the first item that has it.<br>
<br>
Regardless: the additional problem is that without knowing proc rates, it's really hard to estimate these things with any accuracy.  The difference between 1 PPM (50% uptime) and 1 PPM with a 60 sec internal cooldown (20% uptime) is considerable.  That said, lets take a crack at analyzing the purported Sunwell Loots:<br>
<br>
<b>Dragonscale-Encrusted Longblade</b> - #3 Rogue OH.  Warglaive is (obviously) better, as is Blade of Savagery (though not by much), but it does beat the Arena 3 OH.  Additionally has the above-noted problem with Expertise.  Conclusion?  You'd rather have a Warglaive or a Blade of Savagery.  But if you haven't managed to get one yet, this is a perfectly reasonable alternative while you're waiting.<br>
<br>
<b>Muramasa</b> - This is about 1/3 of the way from Blade of Infamy to Warglaive, and thus beats Arena 3 MH handily.  That is, it's clearly the 2nd best OH available, so anyone without a Warglaive should get one.  That said: I'm actually a bit disappointed in this.  Given that we haven't really had a nontrivial MH upgrade since SSC (as Infamy is basically a sidegrade to Talon), I was hoping for a bit more here.  This is more on the order of what I think BoI should have been, so in an ideal world I'd like to see this get a bit of a buff to be more like halfway between BoI and Warglaive - for instance, by keeping the DPS the same but making it 2.7 speed.<br>
<br>
<b>Crux of the Apocalypse</b> - 114 DPS dagger with nice mods.  So, this is *almost* enough to make combat daggers competitive, by which I mean: with Crux of the Apocalypse and the best OH dagger, one does about as much damage as with Muramasa/Blade of Savagery (a bit less against Murderable targets, a bit more against nonMurderable targets).  Meaning that, if this is actually the full list of new weapons, Combat Daggers with Crux is now competitive with anything else you can do that doesn't involve Legendaries.  Which is nice.  Of course, you still have the other disadvantages of being a dagger rogue, so personally I'm still thinking I'll stay with swords.<br>
<br>
<b>Shiv of Exanguination</b> - About halfway between Crux and Shard of Azzinoth.  It initially surprised me that it was so much better than Shard, and then I realized that the raw speed/damage of the weapon is only slightly less, and it has the advantage of having lots of nice stats on it.  That said: with Crux and the best OH dagger, you do only slightly more overall damage than Talon of Azshara/Arena 2 OH, so unless you're *really* devoted to the notion of using daggers, I'd leave this one to the hunters.<br>
<br>
<b>Fang of Kalecgos</b> - This would be the aforementioned "Best OH Dagger".  It doesn't beat Arena 3 and Messenger of Fate by tons, but it does beat them.  So if you're planning to get Crux and go daggers, you should pick this up.<br>
<br>
So, the end conclusion on weapons is: Warglaives are still the best game in town (duh), but if you don't have them, Muramasa/Savagery or Crux/Fang are the best available options, and are reasonably comparable on the whole.<br>
<br>
And now, for the trinkets.  Before we get started, for comparison purposes, the top trinkets available at the moment, scored according to my gear/spec:<br>
<br>
DST: 219<br>
AToL: 185<br>
WSC: 181<br>
MotB: 175<br>
TT: 155<br>
<br>
Now, the new trinkets:<br>
<br>
<b>Steely Naaru Sliver</b> - Even assuming for the moment that this didn't put any combat rogue over the Expertise cap (and it does), it'd still only score a 151.  Leave this one to the tanks, who gain the equivalent of 6.5% hit from it, and a nice tanking proc to boot.<br>
<br>
<b>Shard of Contempt</b> - As mentioned, this puts you near the Expertise cap by itself, so if you're currently wearing other Expertise gear you need to keep that in mind when deciding whether or not to use this.  And if you're a human using sword in maces, you're over just with this, that, and the talent.  But, regardless: lets assume for the moment that you can make full use out of it.  Then, if the proc rate is 1 PPM (which seems excedingly unlikely to me), it'd score 265 overall, and be awesome.  If it, instead, had a 60 sec internal cooldown (which is towards the high end but still plausible), it'd be more like 178, which puts it right amongst the current top trinkets (though in practice there's not much reason to use it anyway, due to the Expertise issues).  So, fundamentally, this could be the best trinket in the game or pretty mediocre, or anywhere in between.  Hard to say much more than that without knowing the proc rate.<br>
<br>
<b>Blackened Naaru Sliver</b> - I'm not even going to bother computing the value of this assuming no internal cooldown, as it'd be ridiculously broken (like, old DST level broken) without one.  Looking at it, it almost certainly has an internal cooldown of at least 30 seconds and as much as a minute.  So lets use those as endpoints to estimate it's value.  When it goes off, it stacks up to full in an average of 5.66 seconds.  Thus, if it has a 30 second cooldown, it scores... 273.  If it has a 60 second cooldown, it still scores 215.  So assuming that the proc rate is anything reasonable on this, it + DST are likely the best two trinkets in the game, with order depending on the exact proc rate.  AKA, "You want to get one of these".<br>
<br>
Once people start getting and we get some proc rate numbers, I'll worry about putting these in the sheet.  Until then, I'm not too worried about it.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_632797"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->At first glance on t6.5 stuff from vendors it seemed that best slots to retain t6 4pc would be chest or shoulders, belt, bracers, boots which is kinda smeh. I couldn't come to a decision between the new helm and cursed vision, it all came down to how good haste would be coupled with other items. Once we get a spreadsheet hack out it'd be possible to play around considerably. <br>
<br>
As for the expertise trinkets. Since Vashj gave us lots of awesome -threat trinkets I never got the belt. However if you consider the boots give a hefty amount already it's a bit smeh that they decided to stack so much of a single item (thus eating more of the itembudget as well...More balanced items please!). <br>
Ideally I'd like to see a overhaul of entire t6 to reflect the boots/belt/bracers and their individual stats (ie balance expertise over several items and so on.)<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_632841"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->So, brief assessment of the new loots (spreadsheet version should be out in a couple days; I'm going to wait for more gear to become available before worrying about it too much):<br>
<br>
<b>Slayer's Bracers</b> - Roughly a 20 point upgrade over Insidious, and thus a clear best in slot<br>
<b>Slayer's Belt</b> - Roughly a 60 point upgrade over 100 Deaths, and thus a large upgrade.  Best in slot.<br>
<b>Slayer's Boots</b> - Roughly a 95 point upgrade over Shadowmaster's.  A HUGE upgrade.  Best in slot.<br>
<b>Quad Deathblow X44 Goggles</b> - Just slightly better than Slayer's, 20 points behind Cursed Vision.<br>
<b>Hard Khorium Choker</b> - About a 25 AP offensive upgrade over Endless Nightmares, with another 20 points from Stamina.  Nice upgrade, seems to be best in slot.  Whether it's worth dropping Leatherworking (Drums) or Enchanting (Rings) to get is somewhat debatable.<br>
<b>Hard Khorium Band</b> - Sidegrade to Stormrage Signet Ring from an offensive perspective, but has more stamina.  Best in slot.<br>
<b>Shattered Sun Pendant of Might</b> - Really depends on the proc.  By itself, it's way back in the pack; with the proc, it  could literally finish everywhere.<br>
<b>Bladed Chaos Tunic</b> - Roughly 70 AP upgrade over Slayer's.  Best in slot.<br>
<b>Shadowed Gauntlets of Paroxysm</b> - Roughly 20 AP upgrade over Slayer's.  Best in slot.<br>
<b>Duplicitous Guise</b> - Roughly 65 point upgrade over Cursed Vision.  Best in slot.<br>
<b>Shoulderpads of Vehemence</b> - 45 point upgrade over Slayer's, Best in slot.<br>
<b>Leggings of the Immortal Night</b> - 150 point upgrade over Slayer's.  Another HUGE upgrade.  Best in slot.<br>
<br>
So, looking at this, It appears that the optimal Slayer's pieces to use are Boot, Belt, Bracers, and Gloves, with Duplicitous Guise, Shoulderpands of Vehemence, Bladed Chaos Tunic, and Leggings of the Immortal Night rounding out the other 4 slots.  And pretty much all of those changes are huge, massive, ridiculous upgrades.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_632941"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Another quick update, for the LW items:<br>
<br>
<b>Carapace of Sun and Shadow</b> - About 30 AP better than Bladed Chaos Tunic, so about 100 AP better than Slayer's.<br>
<b>Gloves of the Immortal Dusk</b> - About 25 AP better than Shadowed Gauntlets of Paroxysm, so about 45 AP better than Slayer's.<br>
<br>
Note that gloves are still the slot with the smallest available upgrade, so you still probably end up using Slayer's... although the shoulders are pretty close, meaning that Gloves of the Immortal Dusk with Slayer's Shoulderpads is not an unreasonable option either - particularly since that setup is weighted a bit more towards crit/ArPen and less towards hit/haste, which makes it better in interrupted fights.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Well, personally, I'm still a bit skeptical about the items listed for Sunwell, if for no other reason than because they're *ridiculously* expertise heavy.  Shard of Contempt, for instance, puts any combat rogue at the Expertise cap by itself, meaning that if you have any other Expertise gear at all (notably the Vashj belt or the Sunwell OH Sword) you're now well over the expertise cap.</div>

	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>I'd say there's two potential answers to this probem:<br>
<br>
1. Spec out of weapon expertise. Though there's not much else DPS-wise to pick up, it's an option.<br>
2. Blizzard is gearing for WotLK. Expertise should be an excellent stat for leveling, as you'll be facing mobs frequently resulting in much fewer dodges/parry/blocks. And you'll be back under the cap again in no time, I'm sure. If I'm not mistaken, the Tier 3 gave excellent bonuses for leveling as well.<br>
<br>
In any case, we'll know soon enough.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

"<b>Hard Khorium Choker</b> - About a 25 AP offensive upgrade over Endless Nightmares, with another 20 points from Stamina.  Nice upgrade, seems to be best in slot.  Whether it's worth dropping Leatherworking (Drums) or Enchanting (Rings) to get is somewhat debatable.<br>
<b>Hard Khorium Band</b> - Sidegrade to Stormrage Signet Ring from an offensive perspective, but has more stamina.  Best in slot."<br>
vs.<br>
"<b>Carapace of Sun and Shadow</b> - About 30 AP better than Bladed Chaos Tunic, so about 100 AP better than Slayer's.<br>
<b>Gloves of the Immortal Dusk</b> - About 25 AP better than Shadowed Gauntlets of Paroxysm, so about 45 AP better than Slayer's."<br>
<br>
Since Ring and Gloves are both (at this stage) BoE, but require 5 and 6 sunmotes respectively to make I'd say it really seems to favor Leatherworking. Especially since (speculating here) there might be a better neck from Sunwell, while the LW chest would be best. Not to mention drums.<br>
Also, in most zero-sum dkp systems chest/gloves are somewhat more expensive than Neck/Gloves so that's another aspect to consider.<br>
<br>
If I had only known earlier... Started leveling JC about four days ago for PvP since LW offered nothing for it.<br>
<br>
P.S. Ring Enchants are 13.37 ap value points (per one) for me so dropping enchanting as well for Jewelcrafting would be weighted upgrade.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_633565"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->An interesting problem has just occurred to me.  If one wears the optimal gearset I mentioned above (T6 Bracers, Gloves, Belt, and Boots, Duplicitous Guise, Shoulderpads of Vehemence, Carapace of Sun and Shadow, Leggings of the Immortal Night with Hard Khorium Choker, Shadowmoon Destroyer's Drape, Hard Khorium Band, Stormrage Signet Ring, Ashtongue Talisman, DST, Warglaives, and Arcanite Steam-Pistol), a couple of notable issues arise.<br>
<br>
1) You only have one blue socket.  Meaning that you have to stick a Purple gem into one of your red sockets somewhere.  Not really a major concern, but something to be aware of.<br>
<br>
2) If you socket everything else with Glintings, you wind up with 358 hit rating - aka "very very close to the hit cap".  Which in particular means that when socketing endgame gear one can no longer really use Rigid Lionseyes (not a major issue in that one only has 2 yellow slots anyway), and getting some Delicates might not be a bad idea (for instance, using 3 Delicates to get base hit down to 343, giving you the flexibility to use agi food on more movement-based fights and still be hit-capped thanks to hit food on the sustained fights).  Delicates, are, of course, in high demand in most guilds, so this may not be practical; but the point is that the hit cap becomes a serious concern for end-Sunwell gear.  Even more so if you regularly run with a Balance Druid, a Draenei Warrior, or the like.<br>
<br>
3) However, one can mitigate this by using Slayer's Shoulderpads and Gloves of the Immortal Dusk instead.  This (socketed fully with Glintings) drops your overall hits to 324, giving some cushion away from the hit cap.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Sometimes the item doesnt show as an upgrade, until you put it in.  Using what you currently had (S3 mace) the swiftsteel wasnt better. But since, by using swiftsteel, you lost s3's stats and thus it was better.  Try unequipping the mace period, adding s3 AND swiftsteel stats to two diff weps, adn see which one comes up as better.  If you're still getting s3 &gt; swiftsteel, then you might want to get a higher-up answer..lol I don't know too much past this.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Simplest way it probably just to take a /combatlog and post it on the forums, and someone here (such as myself) will analyze it for you.  Make sure to remove any haste procs you might have, and autoattack with a single weapon only.  Then post the combat log and tell us 1) the speed of the weapon you were using and 2) how much haste rating you had on.<br>
<br>
In general, it's nice to aim for at least half an hour of data collection; if you don't have a healer assisting you, the easiest way to do this is probably the ogres behind the king in DM North.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Shaker is right.  In this case, with the season 3 weapons, the culprit is likely armor penetration as this stat will become increasingly more valuable the more of it you have.  Thus, if you have other sources of armor pen [Armory is currently not loading for your character], the season 3 weapons will slightly increase in value.  By removing a source of ArP (the offhand), you decrease the overall value of ArP that would have been applied to the s3 offhand, and the result is that the new gear set shows a net increase in dps.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_635019"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->In complete endgame gear, the theoretical difference between 3s5r, 4s5r, and 5s5r is all but nonexistent.  At end-T6 gear levels, the extra rupture damage gained from cycle compression is matched by the the loss of SS damage due to Relentless Strikes not always proccing, so one finds that the minimal sustainable Xs5r cycle will be within 1-2 DPS of 5s5r.<br>
<br>
Now, at *slightly* lower gear levels - like, mostly T6 but not Warglaives - 3s5r will hold a slight advantage (5 DPS, say) from a theoretical perspective.  The trick is that this assumes perfectly sustained 3s5r cycles.  In practice, it can happen that a drought of Ruthlessness/Relentless Strikes/Combat Potency procs can induce brief periods of SnD downtime, a fact which is not modeled in the sheet.  That is, the sheet is computing theoretically "tight" cycles, which are probably not sustainable in practice.  Hence, if the sheet is saying that the optimal cycle is 3s5r, then 3s5r is an absolutely tight, minimal cycle which thus is probably not something you want to try.<br>
<br>
A good rule of thumb is that for safety you should add about half a point to the size of the recommended SnD to give you some cushion against bad luck - and since a 3.5s5r cycle doesn't really make sense, this generally puts you all the way at 4s5r.<br>
<br>
So, stated briefly: assuming perfectly sustained cycles, 3s5r, 4s5r, and 5s5r will all do very comparable damage at T6 levels of itemization.  The reason why you observe less damage in practice with 3s5r is either a) caused by the fact that SnD is dropping occasionally, or b) observer bias.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I would suspect that with most rogues already at/near the cap with high-end T6 gear (275+), the extra hit and haste will not have nearly as much of an impact as the sheer amount of extra AP, Crit, and Armor Penetration a rogue will receive by getting the best and brightest loots Sunwell has to offer. I would assume naturally that this would further make 5s/5r the best cycle as Sinister Strike continues to scale up more and more with crit and ArP, while Rupture scales only with AP (and worse than SS does with that).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_635591"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Regarding the next release of the spreadsheet:<br>
<br>
Adding the gear is, for the most part, fundamentally easy.  There are currently 4 major things needed for the next release:<br>
<br>
1) Proc rates on new trinkets.  I could release without this if I had to, but since it's gonna take some time to fix the next three points anyway, I might as well wait for some info on proc rates as well.<br>
<br>
2) New zone filter.  These are sort of a pain to add, so this will take some time.  We're not talking days, but every time I need to add a new one it takes me an hour to remember how to do it.<br>
<br>
3) Expertise cap.  There's now enough Expertise itemization that the Expertise cap is a serious issue; hence, an indicator similar to the Hit cap indicator is going to be needed. (Random thought: the natural place to put this is where "Optimal Hit" is now.  Would anyone miss it horribly if I nuked the "Optimal Hit" field to replace it with your position relative to the Expertise Cap?<br>
<br>
4) Socketed weapons.  When it was Karazhan gear in T5 days and ZA gear in T6 days, I could ignore the issue of socketing weapons; but I just can't justify not being able to put the best dagger in the game in the sheet.  So at long last, I'm going to have to take the time to get weapon socketing up and running.<br>
<br>
There's also some other minor fixes I'll probably put in (like the newest DP-uptime formula), but those will be pretty fast; 1-4 above (and most particularly 4) are what's going to govern when the next release is ready.  My best guess would be "a couple of weeks", though if people want a prerelease version with just the new gear but not the features above (no warning of Expertise cap, Sunwell loot filed under BT, no Crux of the Apocalypse, etc.) I can work something out in that regard.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>2) At the current stage of the game, I don't think a differentiation between 5 Man, Heroics or even Karazhan is necessary anymore. So maybe, you could simply put two of those zones together and use the freed up slot for Sunwell loot.<br>
It's certainly not the most elegant solution, but it's easy and it won't even bloat up the sheet (If it can be done like this at all)<br>

3) Nuke it, good sir. The Optimal Hit field has caused too many stupid questions over the months anyway. Good riddance!. <br>

</div>Not a bad idea...  it's a fair point that some of the catagories are a little more granular than they need to be at this point.  I mean, technically one could lump Kazzak and DW into BoE at this stage.  But I think the catagory that can most stand to be eliminated at this stage is Pre-BC raiding.  There's a grand total of 3 items in that catagory (Bonescythe Bracers, DFT, and Kiss of the Spider), all of which are the worst item(s) for their slot in the sheet.  I think at this point - a good solid year since the expansion came out - I don't have a lot of sympathy for people who haven't managed to find one of the blues that beats their Naxx epics.  So I think I might nuke that catagory to make room for Sunwell.<br>
<br>
In terms of other rearrangements... I'm thinking I might bump SSC/TK level crafted items (i.e., stuff that requires Nether Vortices) down into "Crafted" and keep "Endgame Crafted" for stuff that requires Heart of Darkness or Sunmotes, and/or has a pattern that drops in Hyjal, BT, or Sunwell.<br>
<br>
Additionally, I'm thinking I might lump heroic *drops* in with 5 mans and replace the existing Heroics category with Badge rewards (as Badge rewards no longer equate with needing to do heroics).<br>
<br>
It also seems to me that the gear lists should probably be arranged, as a lot of them now seem a bit out of order (for instance, WSC being way far down the trinkets list despite being one of the better options, due to the fact that it was crap when it was added to the sheet), so I might take a crack at that.<br>

		<div id="post_message_635965"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->For those of you that were wondering whether you should level Jewelcrafting for Hard Khorium Choker: I'm going to go with "no", due to the existance of the recently-discovered <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=34177" target="_blank">[Clutch of Demise]</a>, which is, admittedly slightly inferior (I put it about 15 points behind in both offense and weighted total, putting it 10 points offense and 30 points total ahead of Endless Nightmare), but it closes the gap enough that I think it's now clear that LW/Enchanting is optimal.<br>
<br>
In other news: assuming the above-mentioned estimate of 45 second cooldown on Shard of Contempt it correct, that would put it at 199 EP on the chart listed in post 2037.  So it's a slight upgrade over everything existing except DST for raiding, but (probably) inferior to Blackened Naaru Sliver.  So it might be worth picking up for farming/leveling to 80 with, but I don't think it's particularly interesting for raiding.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">For those of you that were wondering whether you should level Jewelcrafting for Hard Khorium Choker: I'm going to go with "no", due to the existance of the recently-discovered <a class="itemlink q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=34177" target="_blank">[Clutch of Demise]</a>, which is, admittedly slightly inferior (I put it about 15 points behind in both offense and weighted total, putting it 10 points offense and 30 points total ahead of Endless Nightmare), but it closes the gap enough that I think it's now clear that LW/Enchanting is optimal.</div>

</div>I think it's safe to assume that there won't be another dps neck so... the question is "Is there a better melee dps ring that the JC boe one!?"<br>
<br>
Still even with 10 points behind HKC on offense, if you consider that JC also gives 12hit gem, <br>
12hit is ~~5ap better than 10hit, so a total 15 offensive ap upgrade. <br>
They should really add 12agi and 6agi/6hit gems though, would tip the balance well to JC's favor. <br>
<br>
Personally I'm thinking of getting the boe JC ring, enchanting it with 4all stats and then rerolling for JC, gold is hardly a issue and it's a save dkp wise as well. <br>
Afterall as JC/LW You get to skip 2 pieces of lewt and get your t6 boots first!<br>

Kinda like Ozz noted, DPS-wise, Blizz had made the PvP swords king across the board really for each step of progression until you have Warglaives, yet there is a very strong sentiment of "OMG I can't wait to throw these damn things away" almost direct BECAUSE everyone knows they are better and relatively easy to acquire, so you see them everywhere.<br>
<br>
There are no clearer examples of this than the Spiteblade from Kara being chosen over S1, and the twin blades from ZA being chosen over S2.  In both cases, DPS is better w/ the Slicers, but you'd be hard pressed to find a rogue who got both ZA swords and VT'd them and kept his S2 cause his spreadsheet told him to.  There's just something about having actual PVE weapons (hard to get, rare, 'trophy') for those who like to raid that's hard to put down.  That is, as long as the DPS gap isn't too glaring.  Some people (stubbornly) try to gear out totally avoiding Blizz's attempt to force PvP itemization into raiding progression.  I find that amazingly painful, but I understand the sentiment.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

There's now enough Expertise itemization that the Expertise cap is a serious issue; hence, an indicator similar to the Hit cap indicator is going to be needed.

All of your other suggestions make perfect sense. At some point the spreadsheet just needs to move on, and can't hold everyones hand forever. <br>
<br>
Oh i was reading over the thread in the last few days and Ald you were talking about getting to close to the hit cap in SW loot. You basically came to the conclusion that you would have so much hit that hit food would be pointless. But at that point, wouldn't it better to just move to AGI food? Because if you drop, hit for AGI aren't you pretty much doing the same thing? Thus leaving Red gems for casters.<br>

</div>A couple of reasons, I think:<br>
<br>
1) Arena 3 MH isn't really that much better than Blade of Infamy.  I mean, I'm not disparaging 6 DPS nor advocating that you shouldn't worry about it, but the point is it's not a lot of DPS, so people don't worry about it as much as they otherwise might.<br>
<br>
2) Arena 3 MHs are sort of a pain to get.  Not everyone likes to PvP, and thus, particularly for sort of a small upgrade, not everyone is willing to go to the time to get this.  And amongst the people that *do* PvP, I suspect a lot of them get the Arena 3 Maces before the swords, as my understanding is that maces are better for PvP.<br>
<br>
3) Most rogues with Blade of Infamy fall in one of two catagories: people that already have a MH Warglaive as well, and people who hope to get one soonish.  Which further decreases the impetus to worry about intermediate upgrades.<br>
<br>
So, fundamentally: it's quite a bit of work for not a whole lot of benefit, and most rogues are hoping that the little benefit that it gives will be reasonable shortlived.  The fact that BoI also comes with some bragging rights, and Arena 3 is ugly as heck, probably also contributes.<br>

</div>That is, of course, what you end up doing.  My point was that from a purely abstract optimization perspective, you'd rather have 20 more agi and 20 less hit on gear, and make up the difference on food.  Why?

Is this a big deal?  No.  But, as long as we're optimizing to a ridiculous extent anyway, one might as well go all the way.

</div>I agree with this but for a completely different reason.  Im a big advocate of using hit food and gemming the new gear with agil instead of gemming hit and buffing agil for a couple reasons.  First off I tend to grind/pvp (bg) in my raiding gear, so for the random time that im either doing trash or the surreal occaision that im not attacking a raid boss im wasting all that extra hit rating.  <br>
<br>
Lets also not forget the passive herds of talbuk are just begging to be slaughtered, while the other choice is flying around looking for dissappearing mobs that hunters have a tendancy to ninja tag or the appropriate fishing puddle. <!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

In both cases, DPS is better w/ the Slicers, but you'd be hard pressed to find a rogue who got both ZA swords and VT'd them and kept his S2 cause his spreadsheet told him to.  There's just something about having actual PVE weapons (hard to get, rare, 'trophy') for those who like to raid that's hard to put down.  That is, as long as the DPS gap isn't too glaring.  Some people (stubbornly) try to gear out totally avoiding Blizz's attempt to force PvP itemization into raiding progression.  I find that amazingly painful, but I understand the sentiment.</div>

</div>Man, I fit that characterization perfectly.   I have the exact 2 weaps you mention, Spiteblade MH and Talonblade OH.  I love the unique-ness of the swords crossing on the back versus the blandness of the Glad weaps 90% of the rogues on my server sport.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I put S1 Slicer and S2 Quickblade into my spreadsheet in place of my Spiteblade and Talonblade.  The "upgrade" to boring conformity would net me a whole .3% increase in damage: +4.39 dps raid-buffed, 1,279 to 1,284 dps.  S1 + S1 is actually 4.51 LESS dps.  In the end, with the 1,000 other factors in any given fight, a negligible difference.<br>
<br>
.3% more damage isn't enough to make me spend precious paid playing time doing something I hate, PvP, to get the exact same welfare swords as every other mid-level rogue on the server.  I'd rather have fun raiding towards a Talon and finish levelling enchanting for ring enchants to get my min/max mojo.<br>

</div>So, there might be a bit of personal bias in this next statement, given that I'm the other of this sheet and not the other one, but, this is the way I see it:<br>
<br>
This sheet is, on the whole, somewhat more accurate; however, for many if not most purposes, the other is accurate enough to give the right answer.<br>
<br>
To expand on that in a little more detail: this sheet takes a somewhat different approach to doing the relevant calculations which I believe to be more accurate.  However, there is some reasonable room to debate whether it's better or not.  However, what is not debatable is that this sheet has a much more robust and accurate model of certain effects, and, in particular, procs.  For instance, if one is seeking to compare high-end trinkets, I don't think there's a lot of room to argue that this sheet isn't better.  It is, however, also true that the DPS sheet has been steadily improving in this respect.<br>
<br>
However, for the vast majority of questions - with the possible exception of very precise trinket-related questions like "which is better, Ashtongue Talisman or Madness of the Betrayer" - the level of accuracy in the DPS sheet is sufficient to correctly decide which item is better.<br>
<br>
As a final point of clarification: the above comments refer most specifically to the damage estimate from this sheet; the recommendations, by their fundamental nature, can't be quite as accurate as swapping out gear and checking DPS.  So for purposes of finding the best gear, I would recommend using the gear recommendations to resolve most things, but after you have everything in place there may be some slots (particularly trinkets) where you need to swap them in and out to check DPS to be absolutely sure of your answer.<br>
<br>
And of course, as a final clarification: no spreadsheet can tell you the right answer with accuracy of more than a couple DPS.  While this sheet gives you two decimal places on your DPS, I don't pretend that it's accurate on that granularity.  So keep in mind that regardless of which you prefer, the DPS estimates are probably only good to +/- .1% or so.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>A couple of things are going on here.<br>
<br>
1.  s3 sword is a minimal upgrade to Infamy.  If you have s2 swords for PvP and Infamy/s2 sword for PvE, you are probably better off spending arena points elsewhere.<br>
<br>
2.  Infamy/Savagery &gt; s3/s3 for PvE DPS.  Ideally s3/Savagery is the best combo if you can't get Warglavies, but is 6 DPS worth all that time and effort?<br>
<br>
I decided it wasn't worth the effort for me and if I was still doing arena I'd probably spend my points on the s3 armor instead of weapons, especially since I have s2 swords already and just about every single BT/Hyjal upgrade is a larger PvE upgrade for me than the s3 swords are combined.  When it boils down to time spent vs. reward gained, the s3 swords just don't appeal to me.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

What does this mean in practice?  It means that if your recommended cycle was Xs5r or Xs3r (which is most combat sword/fist/dagger rogues, and some hemo rogues), then:<br>

</div>So with the current version of the sheet, Executioner is modeled with a proc of "840 armor pen and 2% haste"?  Or rather, everyone had 2% static haste and Mongoose was just a 120-agi proc?  I can't quite figure out what you mean by "counting the haste benefit on Mongoose towards your DPS whether you have Mongoose or not" and "Mongoose was being undervalued".. was Executioner overvalued or Mongoose undervalued?  Doesn't make a difference in terms of what is better, just something to note.<br>
<br>
Either way, at least this fixes my current itemization / debuff problems on Teron.  6200 armor - 3075 (imp EA) - 800 (CoR) - 610 (FF) - 777 (2x T6, Rings, S3 MH, ZA bow) = 938 armor.  This makes Executioner extremely powerful as it is taking off nearly the very last 840 armor, however it made WSC pretty useless, resulting in using AToL.  Now I'll be able to switch over to Mongoose and WSC.  Wooo!  400g later..<br>

</div>The problem with Mutilate is that there is no known accurate modeling for it.  There are some which are decent estimates, but nothing anywhere near the accuracy of the Combat modeling.  Combine this with the known fact that Mutilate is generally accepted as ~10% less dps than Combat Swords, and as such isn't a "competitive" build, there hasn't been much effort put into modeling it.  Also, for the die-hard Dagger fans.. Combat Daggers is generally accepted as higher dps than Mutilate.  Thus, from a PvE standpoint, Mutilates only purpose is "because its more fun".<br>
<br>
<b>So in short: Mutilate doesn't have a good dps model from which to base gear/spec choices on.  As it is not in close contention with other builds for top-dps, those who are capable of modeling it just haven't bothered putting in the time.</b><br>
<br>
That said, someone had written a fairly rigid Mutilate-only DPS Simulator (forget his name.. I tested it though) but that was never publicly released.  Aldrianna is, I think, working on something.  I had written a base / core to a Rogue DPS Simulator that would handle all talent specs, but haven't put any effort into it in the past month or so.  I may choose to return to that at some point.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Short answer: No.<br>
Long answer: While I fully admit that modeling Mutilate would be nice, the format of this sheet makes it difficult to do so, and spending that amount of time and effort for something that is clearly inferior anyways just doesn't strike me as a productive use of time.  So it's pretty darn far down my list at this point, though if someone else wants to take a crack at adding it I'd be happy to talk them through what's going to be necessary.<br>
<br>
Personally, though, I'm of the opinion that the right way to model Mutilate is to write the entire DPS calculator in a real programming language, as such a thing would be better able to handle all these wierd subtleties.  This is something I've been working on, and it's actually starting to approach the point where you can get some useful information out of it (although there's absolutely no UI attached, at least it calculates damage).  However, even that I have for the moment ignored SF and Mutilate; I do plan to add it eventually, so it will probably show up there before it shows up here; but as that particular project is a few months out in it's own right, I wouldn't hold my breath about that, either.<br>

		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>So, what was happening is that everyone using those cycles was given the benefit of a 1 PPM proc that increases haste by 2% on both hands; thus, the DPS estimate for everyone *not* using Mongoose was too high, and thus the marginal value of Mongoose was lower than it should have been.<br>
<br>
It might also be noted that, with the recent information on Mongoose proc rate, both Mongoose and Executioner had been underestimated in all sheets (though by the same amount so their relative value was not effected by that).  I have since fixed this as well.  So what you'll find with the actual sheet is:<br>
<br>
If you were using neither Mongoose nor Executioner, your damage will go down.<br>
If you were using Executioner, your damage will stay about the same.<br>
If you were using Mongoose, your damage will go up.<br>

</div>If you're curious about whether there are other bugs, I would recommend picking through the sheet and checking.  I mean, I realize it's a lot of work to do so, and I totally understand why people haven't, but... fundamentally, I don't believe for an instant that I've found all the bugs in this sheet, and I do think the best way to find them would be to get another set of eyes (or 5 more sets of eyes) looking for problems.  So if anyone has a couple (dozen) hours to spare and feels like doing a service to the community, I think we'd all appreciate some proofreading/bugfinding on the sheet.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">So, um, I have some bad news for some of you.  I was working on the sheet a bit today and found a rather significant bug in the Xs5r and Xs3r sheets, which, stated briefly, is counting the haste benefit on Mongoose towards your DPS whether you have Mongoose or not.  What does this mean in practice?  It means that if your recommended cycle was Xs5r or Xs3r (which is most combat sword/fist/dagger rogues, and some hemo rogues), then:<br>
<br>
1) Your DPS estimate was a little high, and, more relevantly:<br>
2) The value of Mongoose was being underestimated.<br>
<br>
So, the bad news is: the previous comparisons between Mongoose and Executioner were, basically, just plain wrong.  Mongoose was being undervalued, which made Executioner look better than it really is.  So the established answer of "Executioner may be slightly better at high gear levels"... turns out to be incorrect.  The new answer is, basically: "Mongoose is always better.".  It's not necessarily a *lot* better in all situations... but it's better.  <br>
<br>
My apologies to any of you that have sprung for an Executioner enchant already.</div>

</div>I suggest double-checking that with 6200 Armor bosses.  I've changed the modeling of the DPS sheet so that the uptime % exactly matches between the two.  At least for the DPS sheet and 6200 bosses, I'm still seeing situations (at very high gear levels) where Executioner MH is showing to be superior (although very slightly 5 dps of 2000 or so).  Mongoose does seem superior for 7800 armor bosses in all cases I tried.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Well, let's see here:<br>
<br>
With the base gear and buffs in the sheet, and a 6200 armor opponent:<br>
Executioner: 1759.48<br>
Mongoose: 1763.52<br>
<br>
Bumping up buffs to what I actually raid with (Enhancement Shammy, CoR, etc.):<br>
Executioner: 1954.15<br>
Mongoose: 1957.85<br>
<br>
Bumping gear up to best-in-2.3:<br>
Executioner: 2145.83<br>
Mongoose: 2149.61<br>
<br>
Bumping gear up to best-in-2.4:<br>
Executioner: 2395.34<br>
Mongoose: 2396.3<br>
<br>
(Note that for those last two, "optimal" for the two enchants is slightly different; with Executioner, Ashtongue Talisman is better; with Mongoose, WSC is)<br>
<br>
Now, I'm not going to say that there doesn't exist a gear set where Executioner surpasses Mongoose.  I'm just saying that for every set of gear I've tried, Mongoose wins on straight damage... never mind the fact that it gives you 6+% dodge as well, which really oughtn't to be discounted entirely.  Hence my assertion that Mongoose is better.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I recently put a full Karazhan gearset into the spreadsheet so I could give some advice to fellow Kara rogues, and found that when I changed the buffs from 25-man to 10-man, AP became the recommended gem. I imagine the same thing is happening to you. Keep socketing for hit (though if you're really at 372 hit, you need to lose some as it is. The cap is 364 if you have precision, which I assume you do as Combat Swords), and hope that someday you have an enhancement shaman.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I've been banging out python code on and off for the past month, and in another week or two I should have a damage calculator for cycles of the form XsYr under the same talent restrictions that are present in the gear sheet.  Of course, I still need to write some other cycles (5s, 5sXr3s, that sort of thing), and there's no UI of any sort right now (you have to edit source code to enter your equipment, and even that is fairly manual) - but, that said, it's still a step in the right direction.  I have some reasonable ideas on how to put at least some layer of UI on it, but to start with it'll probably be incredibly primitive (then again, if you look at the 0.1 version of this sheet, it wasn't exactly a work of art either).<br>

My impetus to work on this sort of comes and goes, and I can't swear that I'll ever wind up with something that replaces the spreadsheet.  That's the goal, of course, but how long it takes me to get there - or whether I give up at some point - is anyone's guess.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_639411"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Aldriana, you have Ashtongue Talisman of Lethality rated pretty highly in the gear spreadsheet while the DPS spreadsheet is trying to model it still and for a long time probably was undervaluing it.<br>
<br>
My problem is this: I'm in a tier 6 guild (4/5 Hyjal 4/9 BT).  We do some weekend non-progression runs of Gruul/SSC for things like DST, tier 5 tokens, etc. for our tier 6 raiders and some of our non-raiders that would like to see some of these bosses, but they aren't regular events.  I'm looking for a trinket to complement the DST I already have and having seen a push to better model the Ashtongue Trinket, it seems that trinkets like Warp-Spring Coil and Tsunami Talisman might be better in the hands of our Ret Paladin, Enhancement Shamans or another rogue since I'm 4 points from Revered with the Ashtongue (so the Ashtongue Talisman is within my grasp shortly) and our other raiding rogue is using Bloodlust Brooch and an Hourglass.<br>
<br>
What I'm afraid of is picking up a Tsunami, then a week or two later trying out Ashtongue and realizing Tsunami is inferior and banking it forever.  Usually I base my decisions off of the DPS spreadsheet, but after actually reading the thread surrounding it, Ashtongue was never really modeled properly and now I'm trying to figure out what my best course of action is *for the guild*.  That lead me here, but I haven't found any solid answers in this thread either.  I might have missed it while skimming.<br>
<br>
If I'm going to replace Tsunami or Warp-Spring a week or two after getting Ashtongue, I'll just wait and let someone else end up with an end-game trinket that might not be replaced even in Sunwell.  So far, I don't know anyone with the Ashtongue Talisman that I can get real-world comparisons from.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Aldriana, you have Ashtongue Talisman of Lethality rated pretty highly in the gear spreadsheet while the DPS spreadsheet is trying to model it still and for a long time probably was undervaluing it.<br>
<br>
My problem is this: I'm in a tier 6 guild (4/5 Hyjal 4/9 BT).  We do some weekend non-progression runs of Gruul/SSC for things like DST, tier 5 tokens, etc. for our tier 6 raiders and some of our non-raiders that would like to see some of these bosses, but they aren't regular events.  I'm looking for a trinket to complement the DST I already have and having seen a push to better model the Ashtongue Trinket, it seems that trinkets like Warp-Spring Coil and Tsunami Talisman might be better in the hands of our Ret Paladin, Enhancement Shamans or another rogue since I'm 4 points from Revered with the Ashtongue (so the Ashtongue Talisman is within my grasp shortly) and our other raiding rogue is using Bloodlust Brooch and an Hourglass.<br>
<br>
What I'm afraid of is picking up a Tsunami, then a week or two later trying out Ashtongue and realizing Tsunami is inferior and banking it forever.  Usually I base my decisions off of the DPS spreadsheet, but after actually reading the thread surrounding it, Ashtongue was never really modeled properly and now I'm trying to figure out what my best course of action is *for the guild*.  That lead me here, but I haven't found any solid answers in this thread either.  I might have missed it while skimming.<br>
<br>
If I'm going to replace Tsunami or Warp-Spring a week or two after getting Ashtongue, I'll just wait and let someone else end up with an end-game trinket that might not be replaced even in Sunwell.  So far, I don't know anyone with the Ashtongue Talisman that I can get real-world comparisons from.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>So, I would say that it's pretty safe to say that Tsunami Talisman is fairly seriously inferior to Ashtongue.  So I certainly wouldn't bother with that.  As Cybe noted, WSC is rogue only, so you don't have to worry about taking it away from other classes (although it sounds like your fellow rogue might need it more than you do).<br>
<br>
In general: Ashtongue is a very good trinket for sustained DPS situations - pretty much as good as anything except DST.  For interrupted fights, it fades a bit - I for one prefer WSC for these sorts of things - but even there it's not terrible, and should beat everything except DST, WSC, and MotB.<br>
<br>
Fundamentally: I put quite a bit of time and thought into getting a good approximation of the uptime into this sheet, and while I can't say for certain it's exactly right (and if fact, I'm pretty sure it's not), I do think it's close enough to correctly order it's quality.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I'm somewhat useful at Python hacking, and I'd like to have a look at this at some point. Maybe write some code if there are bits you don't mind delegating, though I have very little experience with the multitude of Python GUI toolkits :o</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>I certainly wouldn't say no to help.  Though to be clear, initially I wasn't even going to bother with a GUI - I was thinking the initial UI would probably be a command line tool.  You write your current gear and buffs down in a file, it reads the file and dumps it's answers out to another file.  About the most primitive thing there is, but it'd work to get started.  In terms of long-term goals, I was thinking of doing it as a webapp with Django, which I have some familiarity with.<br>
<br>
Realistically, though, regardless of the UI specifics, there are some components that are going to be needed.  The major, obvious, two are <br>
1) Some way of inputting gear that then parses out the stats and passes them into my damage computation function (well, more accurately, loads them into an object and parses them out, but, whatever), and <br>
2) A gear recommendation engine which takes uses the damage computation function to compute gear upgrades (ideally including zone filters and all that jazz) and displays them.<br>
<br>
These two most likely both first require building up an internal database of rogue loot (which is perhaps most easily done by scrubbing Wowhead for xml - see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080625064603/http://elitistjerks.com/f31/t10809-item_database_project_all_these_spreadsheets/" target="_blank">Item database project (for all these spreadsheets)</a>.  One could, of course, just have the program hit wowhead directly for 1), but for 2) you really don't want to have to score every item in wowhead, but just a list of reasonable rogue loot.<br>
<br>
Alternately, one could just manually enter all the reasonable rogue gear into, like, a csv and read it from there... although, when we start looking more in the webapp direction, it might make more sense to store it in, like, sqllite and read from there.  And, frankly, there are probably any number of other ways to do it.<br>
<br>
Past that, one of course would also need some sort of UI for entering talents, buffs, etc., though that's somewhat of an easier problem since no additional parsing needs to be done - you can for all intents and purposes just pass in a list of what you have (or perhaps a dictionary, but, again: details not important).<br>
<br>
So, yeah.  If any of this sounds like something you'd be interested in coding, let me know and we can talk over implementation details.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_639826"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Also as a note, and Ald knows about this, but I've put a few hours (and unfortunately not much else) into the ideas for a UI that should be compatible with her backend.  Work/raidleading has been somewhat time consuming these last few months, so I haven't had tons of time to work on it, but if anyone else is interested in this end of things, you can PM me.   Currently I'm working with a php frontend for display of items which can accumulate stats and talent points to pass to a backend calculator.  It also receives back the EAP values of different stats, and then does a lookup in its item database to determine top recommendations.<br>
<br>
<br>
Edit to add: You know, Ald - on another thought, LootRank (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080625064603/http://www.lootrank.com/" target="_blank">Loot Rank</a>) can do most of the heavy lifting for 'results' - I guess it can't do trinkets, and I'm not sure you break down weapons into something that it can handle (such as "5.6 EAP per weapon dps").  Perhaps as a first goal till we can get more UI stuff locked down, we could just generate a lootrank URL + Trinket Recommendations.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

EDIT: I put in the usual MoTW, shaman totems, might/kings and it's shoting +agi gems instead of the atps. Is it still worth dropping that hit for more agi/atp? We're running all 25-man raids now ( I got everything I needed from kara ).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I was aware WSC is rogue-only, I did mention rogues in the list of others that would need it more than me.  I realize that the uptime is related to cycle and such, so I was just looking for a general "which is better" answer, which you've given me.  Tsunami is very good for others and based on my usage of the DPS spreadsheet I was under the impression it was a good alternative to Madness as an end-game trinket and that Ashtongue was junk.  When the spreadsheet suddenly showed a huge jump for Ashtongue, I started doing some research into it a bit more.<br>
<br>
I'm glad I started asking questions before picking up a trinket that I'd be replacing fairly soon.  Thanks for the comments!<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Well, let's see here:<br>
<br>
With the base gear and buffs in the sheet, and a 6200 armor opponent:<br>
Executioner: 1759.48<br>
Mongoose: 1763.52<br>
<br>
Bumping up buffs to what I actually raid with (Enhancement Shammy, CoR, etc.):<br>
Executioner: 1954.15<br>
Mongoose: 1957.85<br>
<br>
Bumping gear up to best-in-2.3:<br>
Executioner: 2145.83<br>
Mongoose: 2149.61<br>
<br>
Bumping gear up to best-in-2.4:<br>
Executioner: 2395.34<br>
Mongoose: 2396.3<br>
<br>
(Note that for those last two, "optimal" for the two enchants is slightly different; with Executioner, Ashtongue Talisman is better; with Mongoose, WSC is)<br>
<br>
Now, I'm not going to say that there doesn't exist a gear set where Executioner surpasses Mongoose.  I'm just saying that for every set of gear I've tried, Mongoose wins on straight damage... never mind the fact that it gives you 6+% dodge as well, which really oughtn't to be discounted entirely.  Hence my assertion that Mongoose is better.</div>

</div>Are we sure these are a flat % increase as opposed to the double-dip effect Murder gets on crits?  This would of course skew the value of Crit and to a lesser degree Agi upwards, albeit slightly.<br>
<br>
Also, do all of these effects stack multiplicatively or additively?  I would assume they multiply, but what about 2x FI? That could be a special case where dmg = dmg * (1 + 0.03 * # FI's) or something.  I'll see what I can test this weekend with my guild's resident Arms, BM and Ret dps'ers.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_640480"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->By all accounts they are multiplicative.  Also, I was recently posting on the Retribution Paladin thread regarding exactly this question [<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080625064603/http://elitistjerks.com/625008-post1836.html" target="_blank">link</a>].  frmorrison and Avitus replied positively that, Improved Sanctity Aura, at least, is a flat *1.02 modifier at the end of all damage output calculations (but did not provide evidence from previous work).  If you really intend to test this, however, I suspect that you will need a massive sample size to significantly detect a 2% difference in damage of a particular ability given the amount of variability you're bound to encounter.  Your best bet may be to start with kicks or gouges, though this may get away from the "double-dipping" mechanics you had mentioned earlier.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_640716"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I wouldn't knock off executioner quite yet.  I uploaded my gear with all the buffs I'd have when we're really going nuts on a boss (haste pots, drums of battle, curse of reck, unleashed rage, the whole shebang).  Executioner does edge out Mongoose in raw DPS with my current gearset.  I saved my sheet so you could look at it: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080625064603/http://www.savefile.com/files/1381337" target="_blank">Free file hosting by Savefile.com</a><br>
<br>
I'd say one of the pieces I do not have which is an obvious negative is Dragonspine Trophy.  When I replaced my ashtongue trinket with DST Switching to mongoose increased my dps by 0.06 DPS.  With my exact gear switching from exe to mongoose lowers my dps by 1.5~.  This is obviously all trivial but it does show that everyone shouldn't immediately go ahead and replace exe with mongoose.  Now if you use weighted....ya mongoose wins hands down.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_640773"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I would note, however, that replacing Madness with WSC bumps Mongoose 7 DPS ahead of Executioner's total.  So, okay, sure.  If you happen to be at end T6 itemization with neither DST nor WSC, and don't care about dodge at all, then yes, Executioner just barely wins against 6200 armor bosses (though still loses handily on 7700 armor bosses).  But, <br>
<br>
1) 1.6 DPS to Executioner on 6200 armor bosses and 7 dps to Mongoose for 7700 armor bosses gives the overall advantage to Mongoose, IMO.<br>
2) Such rogues are probably the distinct minority.  I mean, they clearly exist, but they're the exception and not the rule.<br>
<br>
So, don't let me discourage you from checking the sheet to see what's best for you, but I think the general rule of thumb should be "Mongoose is better" as opposed to the "Mongoose is better T4/T5, Executioner is better for late T6" that we had been using before.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_641669"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->That's probably a reasonable feature to add; I'll put it on my list for things to do in 0.9.5.  If you want to just disable them for yourself, open up the Gems page and look at column F; a 1 in this column means it can be recommended, and 0 means it can't.  So if you just want to directly disable them, just put a 0 in this column for each heroic gem.<br>
<br>
To give the option to disable them, you'd want to basically duplicate the flow of the BT gem option; on the Advanced Settings page, create an option to select whether to use them or not, that assigns either 0 or 1 to some cell on that page; then assign a name to that cell (say, "UseHeroicGems"), and then assign the relevant cells on the Gems page to =UseHeroicGems<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_641856"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->The middle column gives the socketing that scores highest for the item in question.  If you have the sheet set on Offensive weighting, this is the same as the highest DPS item.  If it's on weighted total, it may or may not be the highest DPS option as it also assigns some value to dodge.<br>
<br>
In general, though, I don't recommend resocketing between agility and hit; they're really so close that it doesn't make a whole lot of difference either way.  I suspect you'll find that if you socket all the items exactly as it says to (with the exception of making sure to activate your metagems somewhere), your actual DPS will change by less than half a percent.  It's more a guideline of how to socket moving forward than a specific commentary on regemming what you're wearing.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Re: Dragonhide Bracers.  Now, see, I left these out under the assumption that the rogue bracers would be, like, better than the Feral Druid ones.

Are you looking at the dps numbers or recommended upgrades on the gear spreadsheet?   My guess right now is that the 2pc T4 set bonus is in play when you look at the dps spreadsheet numbers.   The recommended upgrades of the gear spreadsheet doesn't account for set bonuses, but you can still look at the dps numbers on the top left to see the effect.  S3 is probably the better helm by itself, just not so with set bonus.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>first, thx for the quick answer !<br>
i'm looking at the suggested upgrades, and the number with it.<br>
in fact, i still have the t4 shoulder, so it may be possible that the dps speadsheet tell me ton bring back my T4 helm for the bonus 2p.<br>
edit : if i put a new shoulder on the dps gear then my T4 helm, my dps is dropping, but if i put my S3 healm, my dps is upping again, so your theory was right !<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I took a look at this, and it seems that the Exalted ring *is* showing as ~20 AP superior in the suggested upgrades column over the Revered one, and also the upgrade is reflected in your DPS when you switch to it; but as for the column showing the value of the ring itself it's showing up as only .13 AP better than the Revered Band of Eternity.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
My question is, what are you looking towards in terms of gear as soon as 2.4 hits?<br>
<br>
The obvious things are, T6 boots, belt, and bracers look to be pretty much the best items for those given slots.. easily. 24 expertise on Boots? Yes, please. However, with the addition of a number of items with +hit and +haste, I've been wondering how T6 will actually fair well into Sunwell? So, in your opinions, what would you replace the T6 set items (chest, legs, gloves, and shoulders) with from Sunwell? It's pretty clear so far that Warglaives will remain at the top for weapons, respectively, so I won't even worry about that.</div>

<br>
Route 1: <br>
Slayer gloves/boots/belt/bracers for 4 pc <br>
sunwell helm/shoulders/LW Chest/legs<br>
<br>
Route 2:<br>
Slayer shoulders/boots/belt/bracers for 4 pc<br>
Sunwell helm/legs/ArPen chest/LW gloves<br>
<br>
<br>
R1 is hit capped basically as well as having a decently high atp and crit rate<br>
R2 ends up having 300+ more ArPen and around the same dps with slightly less hit i believe (also depends how u gem)<br>
<br>
<br>
of course this is all dependent on your rings/trinkets/etc as well, but I think I am going for Route 2 more since it will be pretty much equal with Route 1 on bosses while having a lot more ArPen which will make my personal and trash dps higher overall.<br>
<br>
What's sad though is even with the extra ArPen, unless ur using ArPen rings (stormrage/primal), and maybe not even then, will u break 1000 ArPen. I see warriors around with 1200+ just from midgrade t6 gear right now</div>

<br>
Which is the best profession to compliment enchanting. Some of the new recipes in leather working seem really enticing as a method to saving some dkp and drums would be a huge/nice addition to our melee group. Jewel crafting on the other hand has that really sick neck coming out and appears to be more profitable in the long run. I currently have alchemy which is more or less a remnant from my lvl 60 days. I'm fully exalted with too many factions so faction recipes to ease the grind either way wouldn't be too hard. <br>
<br>
Secondly, what is the break point where most rogues switch from the standard 3/5 or 4/5 cycles to 5/5 cycles? Is there a specific amount that your sinister strikes should start hitting for that makes them out weigh the rupture damage, if so what is that point. Would there be some correlation towards AP/Crit rating, or is it best just to try and maintain weaving 3/5 and 4/5 cycles?</div>

</div>Optimal hit, if you read the FAQ's just means "if you socketed everything the way the spreadsheet is telling you to, this is how much hit you'll have".  Its pretty much a useless field which has caused several questions such as yours.  The field was actually removed in the current version of the sheet, 0.9.4.<br>
<br>
As a more direct answer.. yes, it is suggesting that you trade some hit gems out for agi gems.  However, you likely fall into at least one of 2 categories here.  First, you may have it set to "weighted" which will value agi as superior due to the dodge component (and armor I suppose).  Second, even if you selected Offensive, Agi and Hit can be quite close at some gear levels (and specifically with various sets of buffs).  However, Agi and Hit are generally close enough that it does not warrant re-socketing.  Simply avoid going over hit cap and keep your gems as they are, Hit or Agi.</div>

</div>I just gained LW - it's awesome.  Cheap to level to 350 (I think it's only cost me about 500g including buying all the rep patterns, yay for exalted everything).  3 of us in the melee group are LW - chaining drums = winning.<br>

</div>I certainly wouldn't.  I mean, don't get me wrong, the 4/5 T5 bonus is nice, but the items individually just drop way too many stats relative to T6 (much less Sunwell loot) to make that worthwhile.<br>

R1 is hit capped basically as well as having a decently high atp and crit rate<br>
R2 ends up having 300+ more ArPen and around the same dps with slightly less hit i believe (also depends how u gem)<br>
<br>
<br>
of course this is all dependent on your rings/trinkets/etc as well, but I think I am going for Route 2 more since it will be pretty much equal with Route 1 on bosses while having a lot more ArPen which will make my personal and trash dps higher overall.<br>
<br>
What's sad though is even with the extra ArPen, unless ur using ArPen rings (stormrage/primal), and maybe not even then, will u break 1000 ArPen. I see warriors around with 1200+ just from midgrade t6 gear right now</div>

While it's true that you no longer see your item ranked directly against the others, but you can still tell where it fits (as it definitionally scores 0, it's after all the gear with a positive upgrade score and ahead of all the ones with a negative score).  By removing it from the list, you gain another useful recommendation slot, which people seemed to like.  So, long story short: it was an intentional change, but if people want it changed back, I can do that.  However, response on the whole has been positive, so I don't have any immediate plans to do so.</div>

In the interest of keeping the gear lists managable, I've tried to not include items that are inferior to easy-to-obtain options in the sheet.  It's the same reason that Stealther's Helm of Second Sight isn't in - because Helm of the Claw is just plain better.<br>

Usually when a blue is left out of the sheet, it's because there's something else easy to acquire that is superior. To manually add items, you can always go to Format -&gt; Sheet -&gt; Unhide. Unhide the Armor sheet and edit one of the cloaks there to be the cloak you'd like to add. You can do the same thing to model Blade of the Unrequited, just overwrite one of the daggers with the Blade and put in the stats with sockets taken into account.<br>

		<div id="post_message_646862">This probably has been discussed somewhere before but I couldn't find anything specific, hence this post. I am having a hard time deciding on my rotation while making the most out of the Ashtongue Talisman trinket. I am in mid level T6 gear (3/5 T6, S3 swords, the rest a combination of kara-BT drops) and the only two decent trinkets I have are WSC and AToL. I think my crit chance is somewhat low (a little less than 27%).<br>
<br>
The gear spreadsheet suggests I use a 3.5s/5r rotation, I try to maintain a 3s/5r rotation but this isn't really reliable and often I have to refresh SnD after 2CPs occasionally after 4CPs. While I hardly ever let SnD fall off there are times when I have trouble putting up 5CP ruptures without risking SnD downtime. Is this generally the case or do I need to pay more attention to energy/start drinking tea?<br>
<br>
The second part of my question is in regards to the Ashtongue trinket. Since the proc has a 20%/combo point chance should I just forget about 3s/5r and go for longer cycles like 4s/5r or maybe even 5s/5r and worry even less about rupture damage? I was thinking of maybe starting of with a 1CP SnD&gt;4CP SnD&gt;5CP rupture and just go 4s/5r from there. Once in a steady cycle I can try pooling energy for a few quick Sinister Strikes after each finishers taking advantage of the proc.<br>
Anyone got any opinions about this?</div>

</div>Yes. Read the various rogue threads. These issues have been addressed a dozen times or more.<br>
<br>
To summarize for you: If the sheet says 3.5s/5r, what it means is that you can't afford to refresh SnD with anything less than 3.5 combo points. Rounding, that means you should be using 4s/5r, since going lower would cause SnD to drop on occasion. (I myself have a recommended 1s/5r cycle but I run 2s/5r because it is easier to maintain.) Also, yes, Ashtongue is more reliable in a longer cycle (4s/5r or 5s/5r) because you can count more on the proc.</div>

<br>
I'm not sure if this is a known issue, so I'd like to go ahead and report it here. When the 5-man checkbox in the Location section is unchecked, gems from these 5-man instances are still being suggested as optimal (specifically Glinting Fire Opal). I should also note that I've chosen not to use BT gems in the Advanced Settings sheet. I understand these gems were recently changed in 2.4 to no longer be unique-equipped and are likely a new addition to the spreadsheet; I'm just bringing this issue to the attention of the author.<br>

</div>Well, it's pretty clearly a net buff, even in terms of weighted total; although it might be worth looking at the end gear set to make sure it still has adequate stamina and perhaps adjusting the offense/defense weighting accordingly.  It will probably be okay; it'll just need to be double-checked.<br>
<br>
The extra hit, however, does mean that the T6 Shoulders + Leatherworking Gloves setup is now pretty clearly superior to the T6 Gloves + Shoulderpads of Vehemence option for anyone who doesn't have extensive access to Crimson Spinels.<br>

</div>A couple guildies brought up an interesting point. It seems as if they are trying to separate the PvP from the PvE game a little more. Stopping us from using 4pc + 4pc of Arena/PvE by taking away the stam.<br>
<br>
It looks though, like we will be coming out about equal as far as health goes with full Sunwell gear, which is fine. There may be a drop after the early bosses due to how quickly everyone will be geared out in the new 3 pieces, but for fights like the twins you can always stick on a piece or 2 of your old gear to kill them early on.<br>
<br>
I'm just amazed at how large of an upgrade this stuff is now, 45 dps alone on the boots from Shadowmaster's!</div>

		<div id="post_message_648598">I have somewhat mixed feelings about the stamina changes, in a sense it's nice, but I would've liked at least SOME stamina left on the items Using the new t6 pieces over my current stuff is a hefty 1k hp loss. It's alleviated by JC neck/ring somewhat, but still, a bit smeh.<br>
<br>
As for t6 in pvp. 4 pc wasn't really a option anyway (<a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=34188"><span><span class="purplename">[Leggings of the Immortal Night]</span></span></a> and perhaps <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=34397"><span><span class="purplename">[Bladed Chaos Tunic]</span></span></a> are definitely way superior to s3 and possibly s4), however I for one will still be going for 2pc. But it's far to early to plan for that.<br>

On another note, does anyone have a sheet hacked with all the latest loots? If possible drop me a PM with a link or something? Not really looking forward to manually adding everything.</div>

<b>Version 0.9.5 (beta), 2/22/08</b>: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304161636/http://www.savefile.com/files/1396773" target="_blank">Download</a><br>
<br>
*Added option for disabling Heroic gems in recommendations.<br>
*Added weapon socketing<br>
*Added Crux of the Apocalypse, Rage, and Umbral Shiv.  Did not add Fool's Bane or Blade of the Unrequited (though they will now work) because they suck.<br>
*Fixed BoEC current EAP value bug.<br>
*Fixed the socketing algorithm. It now correctly detects which set bonuses are active (i.e., a purple and a yellow will no longer activate red/blue sockets).<br>
*Adjusted the base armor value from 7700 to the exact value of 7685.<br>
*Corrected some assorted text boxes.</div>

		<div id="post_message_650858">I've noticed that the sheet is now recommending a 5s/5r cycle to me, if I have Drums of Battle and Curse of Recklessness enabled, but 3.1s/5r without.  I hadn't noticed this behavior before, so I'm not sure if its new.  Regardless, can you explain to me why this is the case?  I'm curious since I've recently started using Ashtongue again over WSC, and we typically have 2-3 drummers in the melee group, and I already have rounded up to a 4s/5r cycle.  I have no problem with stepping up again to 5s/5r, but would like to understand the mechanic of why it's better with those two particular buffs.<br>
<br>
My guess is that it's because those two particular buffs do not have any effect on my Rupture damage, but offer significant increases to the rest, so it makes more sense to lengthen the cycle.</div>

		<div id="post_message_651001">So, fundamental reasoning here is as follows:<br>
<br>
When you're doing, say, a 3s5r cycle, you are spending, on average, 6.8*40 + 10 = 282 energy per cycle, only 272 of which is going towards Sinister Strikes.  When you do a 5s5r cycle, all 8.8 * 40 = 352 energy is being spent on Sinister Strikes.  Thus, while 3s5r does give higher Rupture uptime, you are paying for that higher uptime with energy.<br>
<br>
As it turns out, the increased rupture uptime is worth the energy cost for lower levels of itemization; but when your weapon damage, AP, crit, and Armor Penetration get high enough, one finds that it is more efficient to spend that energy on Sinister Strikes than it is to get higher Rupture Uptime with it.  As it turns out, at end-T6 level itemization - we're talking MH Warglaive + best in slot for most of the other slots level gear, with a fairly high level of raid buffs - this crossover point is reached, so 5s5r takes over as your optimal cycle.<br>
<br>
Random side comment for clarity: when I say T6 I'm referring to BT/Hyjal itemization.  I intend to use T6.5 to refer to Sunwell Loot, as while Sunwell does drop T6 set pieces, the item quality is definitely a tier above (if not several tiers above) MH/BT loot.  As the upgrades from end-BT to Sunwell are in many cases larger than upgrades from T5 to end-BT, and in some cases larger than T4 to end-BT, it seems like it deserves it's own classification - hence T6.5.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I've noticed that the sheet is now recommending a 5s/5r cycle to me, if I have Drums of Battle and Curse of Recklessness enabled, but 3.1s/5r without.  I hadn't noticed this behavior before, so I'm not sure if its new.  Regardless, can you explain to me why this is the case?  I'm curious since I've recently started using Ashtongue again over WSC, and we typically have 2-3 drummers in the melee group, and I already have rounded up to a 4s/5r cycle.  I have no problem with stepping up again to 5s/5r, but would like to understand the mechanic of why it's better with those two particular buffs.<br>
<br>
My guess is that it's because those two particular buffs do not have any effect on my Rupture damage, but offer significant increases to the rest, so it makes more sense to lengthen the cycle.</div>

	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>In theory, you should actually get opposite results when using these two buffs independently.  Curse of Recklessness would be a huge increase in value to your sinister strikes while not changing that of rupture.  Thus, as Aldriana pointed out, the net result of allocating energy toward sinister strikes at the expense of rupture is a gain in dps.  The only influence drums should have in this interplay would be to increase the amount of energy one gains through combat potency, thus supporting a shorter cycle with higher rupture uptime, no?</div>

</div><br>
With my gear in the spreadsheet, 1 haste rating is worth ~2.2 EAP. So for me, Drums of Battle would be worth 176 EAP during the duration. Drums of War would obviously be only 60 EAP for the duration.<br>
<br>
Assuming you do back-to-back drums of battle you get a 50% uptime and it's worth essentially 88 EAP.<br>
If you stack drums of battle with drums of war you get 25% uptime on each or 44 + 15 = 59 EAP, plus some extra for the effects of stacking. However, I really don't think the "extra" effect of stacking 80 haste with 60 attack power comes anywhere near 29 EAP, which is almost double the EAP of the Drums of War.<br>
<br>
In Conclusion, Drums of Battle are significantly better than Drums of War.</div>

</div>That's my basic thought too. We've got a fair few ways to drop aggro in addition to a passive threat reduction.<br>
It's just that at the moment, my guild's making ranged DPS all get the sub enchant to cloak because they've been doing dumb things like pulling aggro and wiping the raid. And the ranged dps are saying "if we need it, so do melee dps!"<br>
So I was wondering if there were numbers to back up my statement that agi is more dps than sub. I'm pretty sure I've seen it before, but *shrug* couldn't find it.</div>

		<div id="post_message_652872">Well, it's going to be hard to come up with a meaningful comparison, as only one is really functional at a time.  That said, if you *are* getting benefit from sub, you are gaining more DPS from it than a rogue gains from agility.<br>
<br>
Personally, the way I'd manage that situation is to simply ask the question "are rogues pulling aggro".  If they are, the ranged folks might have a case.  But if they're not, why should they have to enchant subtlety?<br>
<br>
Of course, the deeper answer is that if people are pulling aggro, Subtlety isn't the answer.  Either your DPS are being sloppy and overnuking, or you tank sucks (or both) - but a 2% threat reduction isn't really going to help anything.</div>

		<div id="post_message_653479"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Guys, I'm really sorry if I seem retarded by asking this but the fact is I've been browsing the forums and using search tools reading as much as I can on it as possible.  I also suck at math and a lot of the time I feel like my brain is being scrambled trying to understand certain equations given.<br>
<br>
Anyway, on to the question.  I've noticed that armor penetration gets better the lower the armor value of the boss and the more penetration that you have.  My ability to analyze gear is questionable at best but I'm trying to understand why on the gear spreadsheet it shows certain pieces of vengeful as being better than deathmantle pieces.<br>
<br>
Is it trying to say that if I had all of the vengeful pieces suggested it'd weigh out as more damage than the deathmantle pieces or are there individual benefits PVE wise that vengeful provide which are better than the given deathmantle pieces?  Is it because hit combined with the armor penetration weigh in as better than the significantly higher attack power?  The examples I'm speaking of are the head piece, shoulders and chest of the respective sets.<br>
<br>
I am really hesitant posting this here seeing as I'm not very knowledgeable and I don't want to waste your time but it's been wracking my brain all morning.<br>

		<div id="post_message_653599"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->First: I would recommend that you not sign your posts, as the powers that be look unfavorably on such things.<br>
<br>
Second: At the risk of sounding unhelpful and tautological: they're better because, well, they're better.  The spreadsheet makes an estimate as to how much DPS you get from each stat, so when an item scores more highly, that means it's better.<br>
<br>
So, for instance, for helms: Deathmantle has an extra 8 agility, 24 attack power, and 5 crit rating in exchange for 12 hit and 84 armor pen.  When one scores the damage contribution for these, one finds that it is fairly close (depending on exactly what gear and buffs you have, either can score higher).  Thus, if you score the items on Offensive, I suspect you will find that they are very very close.<br>
<br>
However, Vengeful has a lot more defensive stats, so if you score them on Weighted Total, Vengeful wins.  And even if you subscribe to the school of thought that defense is more or less irrelevant and that offensive stats are all that matters, it should be clear that if two items have equal DPS, the one with more defensive stats is better.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Guys, I'm really sorry if I seem retarded by asking this but the fact is I've been browsing the forums and using search tools reading as much as I can on it as possible.  I also suck at math and a lot of the time I feel like my brain is being scrambled trying to understand certain equations given.<br>
<br>
Anyway, on to the question.  I've noticed that armor penetration gets better the lower the armor value of the boss and the more penetration that you have.  My ability to analyze gear is questionable at best but I'm trying to understand why on the gear spreadsheet it shows certain pieces of vengeful as being better than deathmantle pieces.<br>
<br>
Is it trying to say that if I had all of the vengeful pieces suggested it'd weigh out as more damage than the deathmantle pieces or are there individual benefits PVE wise that vengeful provide which are better than the given deathmantle pieces?  Is it because hit combined with the armor penetration weigh in as better than the significantly higher attack power?  The examples I'm speaking of are the head piece, shoulders and chest of the respective sets.<br>
<br>
I am really hesitant posting this here seeing as I'm not very knowledgeable and I don't want to waste your time but it's been wracking my brain all morning.<br>

</div>Just briefly, don't sign your posts <br>
<br>
I really am feeling nice today or else I'd tell you to do your own work (end random tangent).<br>
<br>
Anyways, the reason why Vengeful pieces are probably showing up as better than Deathmantle is the sheet being on "Weighted" Total, factoring in stamina and dodge from agility to item rating. If you were to put it on Offensive you'd probably see T5 as superior in at least some of the cases, buffs being the determining factor (although you may want to factor in those defensive bonuses, it's personal preferance since they certainly DO help). Another reason for the Vengeful pieces with Armor Pen showing as superior could be the boss armor: is the sheet set to 6200 or 7700 armor bosses? As you correctly point out, if it's the former Armor Penetration would be worth more. It's probably worth evaluating pieces under both settings, especially as you move to T6. Anyways, let's take a look at the pieces you mention.<br>
<br>
With default gear and buff set, all gear socketed optimally for DPS, and set to Offensive:<br>

<a class="itemlink q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33701" target="_blank">[Vengeful Gladiator's Leather Helm]</a> is probably the best piece of the set, an 0.68 EP upgrade over the <a class="itemlink q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30146" target="_blank">[Deathmantle Helm]</a>.<br>

<br>
One final note, watch the set bonuses. 4pc T5 is pretty damn good, so once you have that there'll pretty much be no attainable gear set which is better for those 4/5 slots until 2t6.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>A cap isn't something you usually shoot for, but rather something to be avoided. Assuming a 6.5% dodge rate on bosses, the cap would be at 102.5 Expertise rating. Any point above that is entirely wasted.<br>
<br>
Now let's have a quick look at the Shard of Contempt. It provides 44 expertise rating, but we can only use 39 because of the cap, if we're wearing the Slayer's Boots and specced WEx. Using the AEP values from the Roguecraft 101 thread, this equals 39 * 2.56 = 100 AEP. The proc is a bit harder to evaluate as we don't know the proc rate and, well, it's a proc. According to the Wowhead comments, it has a 45s internal CD, so for simplicities sake, I am going to assume a generous 20s per 60s uptime resulting in roughly 77 AEP. <br>
So in total, it's at 177 AEP which puts it clearly behind DST, WSC, Ashtongue and probably even Madness of the Betrayer.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_654715"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I'm trying to figure out which trinket to go with until Blackened Naaru Sliver. Its either WSC, Madness or Shard of Contempt. The difference between WSC and Madness at my gear level seems negligible at best. The Shard of Contempt however is interesting coupled with Slayer's Boots considering it could be as much as 4 weeks to even open Rohendor and possibly longer to kill M'uru (if he even drops Blackened Naaru Sliver). I'm already at the hit cap so its AP vs ArP vs Expertise. <br>

				And now, for the trinkets. Before we get started, for comparison purposes, the top trinkets available at the moment, scored according to my gear/spec:<br>
<br>
DST: 219<br>
AToL: 185<br>
WSC: 181<br>
MotB: 175<br>
TT: 155<br>
<br>
<br>
Shard of Contempt - As mentioned, this puts you near the Expertise cap by itself, so if you're currently wearing other Expertise gear you need to keep that in mind when deciding whether or not to use this. And if you're a human using sword in maces, you're over just with this, that, and the talent. But, regardless: lets assume for the moment that you can make full use out of it. Then, if the proc rate is 1 PPM (which seems excedingly unlikely to me), it'd score 265 overall, and be awesome. If it, instead, had a 60 sec internal cooldown (which is towards the high end but still plausible), it'd be more like 178, which puts it right amongst the current top trinkets (though in practice there's not much reason to use it anyway, due to the Expertise issues). So, fundamentally, this could be the best trinket in the game or pretty mediocre, or anywhere in between. Hard to say much more than that without knowing the proc rate.<br>
<br>
Blackened Naaru Sliver - I'm not even going to bother computing the value of this assuming no internal cooldown, as it'd be ridiculously broken (like, old DST level broken) without one. Looking at it, it almost certainly has an internal cooldown of at least 30 seconds and as much as a minute. So lets use those as endpoints to estimate it's value. When it goes off, it stacks up to full in an average of 5.66 seconds. Thus, if it has a 30 second cooldown, it scores... 273. If it has a 60 second cooldown, it still scores 215. So assuming that the proc rate is anything reasonable on this, it + DST are likely the best two trinkets in the game, with order depending on the exact proc rate. AKA, "You want to get one of these".

However, you would lose 1.268% if you drop down to 1/2 WEx, so you would be down to 5.5% making the whole effort of getting the Shard of Contempt pretty meaningless.<br>

You're only going to be 0.3% above the supposed 6.5% cap anyway.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">i will never understand why so many rogues are hesitant in speccing into anti-fear/stun. It's a great chance to continue dps and a useful filler.<br>

Speaking of useful fillers... <a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?talent=f0ebovZMIV0bVzxzGRt" target="_blank">Talent Calculator - World of Warcraft</a> or even zero WEx and 1 imp kick is better then going above the cap and wasting talent points...</div>

	</tbody></table>
</div>If it was a viable trinket, I would agree, but since it isn't, wouldn't you rather keep the talent points and use a trinket with higher dps, thus upping your total dps.<br>
<br>
If the blackend Nauru sliver had it, yeah, I'd agree that it's worth speccin out of, but as we can all see, Shard of Contempt should be EASILY avoided by almost anyone farming BT/Hyjal and moving into Sunwell, thus, no need to spec out.<br>
<br>
<br>
Edit: EASILY is proabbly wrong after rereading vulajin's note.  If it is just slightly worse than DST, then it's possible that spending the points somewhere else would be worth it.</div>

		<div id="post_message_655104">So, the issue with speccing out of WEx is that there are no damage talents to take instead.  And this is not to say that some of the talents you can get instead (Nerves of Steel, for instance) aren't good - but they don't help your DPS at all.<br>
<br>
So, for instance: Shard of Contempt gives 44 expertise rating and a proc.  But if you drop both points in WEx to stay under the Expertise cap with it, what you've really gained is effectively a trinket that gives 4 expertise rating, the proc, and 10% stun/fear resist.  Is that a bad trinket?  No.  Might it get used in pvp?  Perhaps.  But can *anyone* honestly say that they'd use that regularly for raiding?  No.<br>
<br>
And that's fundamentally the issue with trading out WEx.  The utility it gives is certainly nice... but when compared to doing more damage, there's just not a lot of reason to take them.  So fundamentally, any Expertise on gear that, when coupled with WEx, puts you over the hit cap is wasted damage - regardless of whether you take WEx or not.</div>

		<div id="post_message_655120">For a rogue who's farming Hyjal/BT and advancing into Sunwell, both of your observations are quite accurate. However, rogues before that point will certainly get plenty of use out of the Shard, as the only item with expertise rating that such rogues are likely to wear is <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30106"><span><span class="purplename">[Belt of One-Hundred Deaths]</span></span></a>. Human rogues, of course, will have little use for both items together, but quite a large number of rogues are not human, and those rogues can wear the belt together with <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=34472"><span><span class="purplename">[Shard of Contempt]</span></span></a> to cap their expertise (wasting only 5 rating).<br>
<br>
Anyway, for what it's worth the estimate of the actual AP effect of the trinket is about 88 (nearly 40% uptime). So if you can't get <i>any</i> value out of the expertise, that's how much the trinket's worth.</div>

		<div id="post_message_655212">I don't think anyone is claiming that it's useless... I think there was some assertion that it probably wasn't excessively better than the existing nonDST trinkets, but that was based on guesses at the proc rate.  As the proc rate is somewhat higher than our guesses, the trinket is of course correspondingly better.<br>
<br>
That said: it's unlikely to be better than both DST and Naaru Sliver, meaning it's not best in slot; and while it's certainly an upgrade until one gets Sliver, it's also true that relative to the other upgrades available in T6 content it's a reasonably small upgrade.  Neither of which is a reason not to run Magister's Terrace to get it; it's not like it costs you DKP - but nor is it a particularly big deal if you don't get around to picking one up.  Fundamentally: according to our best guesses at this time, it is a pretty good trinket that is relatively easy to obtain and thus reasonably interesting; but as it's not expected to be endgame gear for a Sunwell rogue, it's not as interesting as it might be.</div>

My gut feeling is that parry is a lot higher than dodge for most mobs, so even after capping dodge it might be a worthwhile stat? You'd only be getting half the value since it would only be eliminating one of the two (parry and dodge) but that is the case with raiding now anyway...<br>

		<div id="post_message_655400">Well, I suppose it's all relative. The Shard appears to be the third best trinket in the game, especially if you don't have the Vashj belt. Many of us never got the DST. Many of us never got the WSC. I run Berserker's and Romulo's. That's as good as it gets for me. It seems like the Shard is a blatantly obvious, superb choice and even if somehow a WSC &gt;&gt;or&lt;&lt; DST came my way that'd still be true (I run a Gruul nearly every week if possible; ugh).<br>
<br>
Yes, the Ashtongue is on its way soon enough and I suppose I could get a Madness. But the hunters are obsessed with burning DKP on hit gear, and honestly, while it's a real upgrade for me, I can't see spending big to get one -- assuming we even have the luck of seeing it drop. (Our guild in two raid teams was a zero Tsunami Talisman group; such is the dice.)<br>
<br>
I'll be running heroic Magister's every day until I get the shard and I doubt it'll get replaced unless I get both the Sliver and the DST. And under that logic, I'm not sure why there isn't more excitement over it. Again, I suppose it's all relative.</div>

		<div id="post_message_656556">Blizzard's nerfed a couple of procs lately, but really only the overpowered ones.  The only two that immediately spring to mind are WSC and Warglaives, both of which were a little too good for what they were.  Thus, I only see this getting nerfed if it's decided to be too powerful for where it drops.<br>
<br>
Now, off the top of my head, it does seem a bit overtuned; my impression was that Magister's Terrace loot was supposed to be somewhere between Karazhan and ZA in quality, and while trinket quality doesn't correlate particularly well with zone (DST (T4) &gt; WSC (T5) &gt; MotB (T6)) this trinket does seem more like low-T6 quality more than T4.5 quality.  Thus, while it wouldn't *totally* surprise me if it gets changed, I don't think it can be assumed that it will be, as even if it is a bit overpowered right now it's not nearly at the level DST and Warglaives were pre-nerf.</div>

For <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30863"><span><span class="purplename">[Deadly Cuffs]</span></span></a>, it's saying that the optimal gem to use is the Rigid Lionseye, but still saying 'No' in the Optimal to use socket bonus category. Since the Socket in those bracers is yellow, using the Optimal gem (a yellow one) should make that bonus, so it should say 'Yes' there.<br>
<br>
It seems to work fine for <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32366"><span><span class="purplename">[Shadowmaster's Boots]</span></span></a>, where it suggests a Glinting Pyrestone / Rigid Lionseye and is actually saying 'Yes' to that one.<br>

I think all it's telling you is if the socket bonus is worth considering to socket for.   +3 stam, no.  +3 crit rating, yes.  It's just happens that there's a yellow slot for a good recommended gem to fit in to.</div>

		<div id="post_message_658789">Honestly, it probably should be the other way... the current check is that if socketing for the bonus is better than just stuffing everything with the best gem, "Use Socket" is Yes; otherwise, it's no.

</div>Considering you may get an extra 5-10 Sinisters strikes with the AToL bonus in a fight, with a 6.7% higher chance to crit on each of them.. you are basically *maybe* getting one extra SS converted from a hit to a crit.  The dps difference is largely equaled out by the increased risk of losing energy regen ticks.  With such a small sample size per fight, your luck on RNG rolls plays a far greater factor than pooling energy and getting a few extra SS's in under the AToL buff.  Over the course of hundreds or thousands of hours of consistant, stationary combat.. you may see a 1-2 dps increase by doing this.  Or you may see a dps loss by having your energy cap out at 100 and losing regen.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_659643"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->The AToL model does not currently include any level of energy queuing.  I have some ideas on how to do so (basically, keeping track of how much "slack" energy the various cycles have and estimating the number of extra SS you can squeeze in during uptime), but such a thing is beyond the scope of this spreadsheet - I may include such a thing when/if I finish my real-code implementation, but no promises.<br>
<br>
However, in terms of the benefit by so doing: it's pretty minimal.  I have previously in this thread given a rough estimate of how much damage you gain by so doing, and while it's not totally negligible it doesn't really change the ordering of trinkets or the overall balance very much.  I'm sure with a bit of searching you could find the post in question, but my recollection is that the difference is less than 10 AP.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<!-- message -->
		<div id="post_message_659947"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Generally you'll want to try and stack CD's which benefit each other.  Haste procs don't benefit each other - however an AP proc goes quite nicely with a haste proc.  Don't bother attempting to save CD's and wait for weapon enchant type procs to go - the loss of CD uptime generally is higher than the potential benefit.  Of course, if you know the fight is going to take 3:30-4 min.. as long as you use your CD once in the first 2 min and once in the second 2 min I could see trying to time it a bit.<br>
<br>
As for when to start your CD's.. 2 things to consider.  First, if you know how long the fight will be, make sure you get your first CD usage off so that you'll be able to use that CD as many times as possible over the duration of the fight.  Second.. make sure you wait until all appropriate debuffs (generally Sunder Armor) are up on the boss before you burn CD's.  The first suggestion generally takes precedence.  For instance, my guild is at the point of killing Teron in ~2:10.  Its worth it for me to pop a Haste pot, Blood Fury and Blade Flury as we run to the boss (5 seconds BEFORE THE FIGHT STARTS) so that I can get in a full 2nd usage.  The first usage of those CD's is generally pretty weak - only 2/3 the duration is actually used and the boss is relatively un-debuffed.  However, its more than nothing.. as long as I get that full usage out of the CD's again when the timer comes back up.<br>
<br>
If for instance you had a 3min fight, you would want to wait until at least 10-15 seconds (to let Sunder stack) into the fight, and no later than 45 seconds to pop your 2-min, 15-second-duration CD's.  Remember, you generally only get 1 AR per fight (baring the odd fight which is longer than 5 min).. use that during some sort of armor pen, AP or crit type proc.  If your an Orc, thats a good time to use AR.<br>
<br>
<br>
As for Haste Rating CD's.. its actually *slightly* to your disadvantage to have them proc at the same time.  This is things like DST, Haste pot, Warglaives, etc.  % based attack speed modifiers (SnD, Blade Flurry, Bloodlust, etc) can be poped whenever and it doesn't matter one bit.  This is due to how weapon speed is calculated with the various effects - non-rating effects all multiply together.  The ratings are added together first, then multiplied onto the other attack speed modifiers.<br>
<br>
Edit: See my post <a href="#post665987" target="_blank"><i>here</i></a> for a slight correction and further description regarding haste.<br>
<br>
In practice, you'll want to pop AP/Crit/ArmPen type stuff at the same time as your haste pot.  Having a DST/Warglaive proc up at the same time is going to be good - despite an overall loss of maybe 0.01 swings from stacking haste rating CD's.<br>
<br>
Hopefully that made sense and answered your question..<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>5/5 doesn't necessarily mean a higher uptime, because 5/5 is a longer combat cycle. Truth be told that 5/5 and 3/5 would most likely have equal uptimes for AToL. 5/5 is longer which means extra time, or 3/5 which is shorter, but may not always proc the trinket.<br>
<br>
Adjusting the cycle for max AToL uptime would be worse than using a cycle for your spec/gear bonuses. For example, 5/5 means you are overlapping SnD for most raid builds. You're wasting combo points(and energy spent for finishers) when it's not needed compared to having more rupture damage due to a higher uptime for rupture.<br>
<br>
The best cycle is the one that balances rupture uptime and snd uptime without letting snd fade.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_661352"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I've come up with an idea for the sheet: Expose Armor support. While it's not particularly hard to manually calculate the boss armor value for Expose Armor, I thought it'd be handy to have EA in the buff section. Of course someone is going to have to apply it, so being able to force-select a 5s5ea cycle would be a nice feature, too!<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_661440"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->While its certainly not the "Easiest" thing to do - you can model this yourself with the current sheet.  Add in a new buff, simply copy the Sunder Armor line and change it to Imp Expose Armor with an ArmPen of 3075.  Select this, deselect Sunder.<br>
<br>
Go to the DmgCalcs sheet, check your dmg done with 5s/5r.  Go to the 5s/5r sheet, find the line (I don't have the spreadsheet open here at work.. its near-ish the bottom) for Rupture DPS.  Subtract that Rupture DPS from the 5s/5r total.  That should be your 5s/5ea dmg.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

What I'm wondering is in the long run will the extra socket in Deep Shadow provide more utility than the Silent Path and is the additional stamina a consideration?

Silent path is a better belt, but not by a ton.  If its worth it to you to buy Deep Shadow in the meantime cause you have the cash, do it.  If its not, wait.

I didn't change the glitch discussed in posts 2243 through 2247; as this is sort of a minor cosmetic change but has the potential to break some stuff in fairly significant ways, I'm going to leave it as is.  Really, I'm half-inclined to just dump the "optimal to use set bonus" column entirely, as it should be pretty obvious whether or not it's using it given that it *tells* you what the optimal socketing is.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>
