<b>Version 0.9.4, 2/14/08</b>: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304233448/http://www.savefile.com/files/1380623" target="_blank">Download</a><br>
<br>
<b>FAQ</b><br>
<br>
Q: Why is the socket bonus for item X not working?<br>
A: It is working.  This is a common misconception/point of confusion.  Column F on the front page does not speak to whether the set bonus *is* active; rather, it refers to whether you *should* be using the socket bonus.  Note that this recommendation does not include metagem activation, so take its recommendations with a grain of salt.<br>
<br>
Q: The "recommended cycle" is showing 3.3s/5r (or something like that), how the heck do I do a 3.3 point slice and dice?<br>
A: You don't.  For smoothness-of-modeling reasons, this sheet uses continuously defined cycles.  In practice, of course, you can't do a 3.3 point SnD.  However, you can weave 3 and 4 point SnDs if you're good (although the mechanics of this is tricky).  If you want to be lazy about this, just use the next larger SnD (4-point, in this case) or the next smaller rupture (i.e., 1s3.5r becomes 1s3r).  If you want to be fancy, go ahead and weave.<br>
<br>
Q: Speaking of 1s3.5r - I'm a dagger rogue with 2/5 T4, and the sheet is recommending a 1s3.Xr cycle.  OMGWTFBBQ?<br>
A: For a full discussion of this I recommend taking a peak at post 532, but the short answer is: using a longer SnD doesn't actually let you use a larger rupture; the extra energy you regenerate during the extra SnD uptime is almost identical to the amount of energy required to launch the extra backstab and get the extra combo point.  Hence, if you can support 5s3r, you can most likely support 1s3r, which gives you almost double the rupture damage in exchange for a slight loss in number of backstabs, and, in practice, this tends to be a worthwhile tradeoff.  So if you're able to sustain 1s3r as a dagger rogue (which basically necessitates 2/5 T4) it tends to be a good choice.<br>
<br>
Q: This sheet gives different answers than the Rogue DPS sheet for the value of item/buff/talent point/whatever X.  What gives?<br>
A: At the risk of sounding like an ass: because this sheet is right and the other is wrong.<br>
<br>
To expand on that a bit: there are a number of modeling differences between this and the Rogue DPS sheet, so they will frequently generate different answers for the value of various pieces of gear.  Thus, they disagree because one is more accurately modeling the effect than the other.  As a general rule, I'm of the opinion that the accuracy of this sheet is higher (although I may be biased - if I didn't believe that, I wouldn't have bothered creating this sheet.)  Ultimately, it's a matter of which sheet you trust more, and that you need to decide for yourself. <br>
<br>
Q: If I have item A equipped, it shows item B as being better, but if I switch to item B, it shows item A as being better.  What gives?<br>
A: The item evaluations in this sheet are based off your current gear; hence, if you change what you have equipped, the relative value of other items can change; hence, loops like the one described do arise when two items are very close in overall quality.  As such, any item difference less than 5 AP or so should be taken with a grain of salt; it's hard to resolve differences on that scale.  If, however, you are serious about knowing which has higher damage output, you can take a look at the "Rough DPS Estimate" cell to see which produces a higher value.<br>
<br>
Q: Why does the "current hit" box disagree with the armory?<br>
A: "Current Hit" includes any buffs you may have, and the default buffs include Spicy Hot Talbuk.  Hence, if you haven't changed the buffs, the sheet should report 20 hit more than the armory.  If it is still off, I would doublecheck your gems.<br>
<br>
<b>Questions from previous versions</b><br>
<br>
Q: What does "Optimal Hit" mean?<br>
A: Optimal Hit reflects the amount of hit rating if you socketed and enchanted your current gear optimally. For exactly what is considered to be optimal for you, consult the middle gear column. Optimal Hit *doesn't* have anything to do with the hit cap - is just an indication of how much hit you'd have if you socketed according to the recommendations in the middle column. This is primarily intended as a warning mechanism, as, in general, "optimal" involves socketing stuff with a whole lot of +8 hit gems, which will frequently put you over the hit cap - the Optimal Hit number is designed to warn you about this so you know not to socket so overwhelmingly with hit.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">1) I don't need a DPS spreadsheet to tell me how much damage I do; all I need is Recap (or equivalent).  What I need a spreadsheet for is comparing various gear and specs to figure out what combination of gear is going to be optimal.  And while the existing spreadsheet can do that, it's not arranged with optimal convenience for such comparisons.</div>

</div>Agreed; some of this can be done.  However, the next-stat computations in the rogue dps spreadsheet are sort of patched on - they don't run through the computation path as the actual damage calculations.  And some effects (Mongoose, for instance) aren't addressed by the next-stat computations at all - there's no easy way to compare the value of Mongoose to the value of some other stat.  Many set bonuses can't be equated to next-stat computations.  At the end of the day: yes, it can be hacked to do approximations of item quality in many cases - but it's not what it was designed to do.  My goal is to write a spreadsheet where that *is* what it's designed to do.<br>
<br>
As another example - consider Dragonspine Trophy.  Right now it's being modeled in the Rogue DPS spreadsheet as a static 40 AP and 120 haste rating, when in reality the proc mechanic is far more complex - but there's just no easy way to implement that in the original spreadsheet (or at least, no one has done it yet).  This spreadsheet actually models it as a proc - and, resultingly, gets some significantly different - and interesting - results... namely, that equipping Dragonspine Trophy *dramatically* increases the value of hit rating, which is a subtlety that the other spreadsheet doesn't pick up on.<br>
<br>
As I say: I'm not arguing that the other spreadsheet doesn't have it's place - but I think it's more of a shotgun solution to question of rogue dps.  It will tell you where in general terms the answer lies, but it's unable to model some of the subtleties introduced by high-end itemization.  It is my intention here to right a scalpel rather than a shotgun, so one can really delve into the fine points of high-end itemization and figure out the best possible way of getting to the top.</div>

</div>So, the character screen (which may or may not be accurate, but that's a separate issue) actually displays .04% crit per point of weapon skill - so that's what I put in.  Now, the patch notes assert that against higher-level mobs, you get more (the .1% to which you refer) - but I haven't really seen any external confirmation of that, so left it out for the moment.  It would certainly be easy enough to change if the community decides that it is likely correct.</div>

<br>
Played around with it a bit, showed some very different results when compared to the spreadsheet, namely: as your haste ratings go up, the value of +hit skyrockets. Particularly noticeable when changing from, say, DST+Abacus and Thundering Skyfire to something like Hourglass+Romeo's and Swift Skyfire. Is the Thundering Skyfire supposed to be that imba compared to the other meta gems? :P<br>
<br>
Another difference I noticed was the marked difference in the Netherblade 2/5's DPS value in your sheet compared to the DPS spreadsheet. Does it really add that little?<br>
<br>
And I take it that the 'sword' cell block in the armor sheet is supposed to mean 'offense'?</div>

</div>So, addressing this set in reverse order: I have no actual data on the proc rate of TSD, so I estimated it as 1 PPM.  Whether this is even remotely close to correct, I have no idea; I've been unable to get ahold of one.  So it is possible that that value is somewhat inflated.<br>
<br>
That said: Haste is really dang powerful, so it almost certainly *is* the best metagem.  However, if the proc rate turns out to be lower, it won't be first by so ridiculously much.<br>
<br>
As for the increase of the value of hit rating: it is certainly possible that I made a mistake in my calculations somewhere - if someone would like to review the calculation sheets and make sure they're sensible, I'd greatly appreciate it.  However, the answer is plausible to me.  Why?  Well, first, the more haste you have, the more white damage you're doing, so it's certainly plausible that that's going to increase the value of hit.  However, I think the larger effect is: Dragonspine (and TSD, as modeled) are HUGELY powerful procs, and if you have one (or both) on your gear, you gain significant amounts of dps just by proccing them more - hence it becomes of crucial importance to hit as often as possible, to get procs as often as possible.  This feedback mechanism - more hit gives more procs gives more haste - isn't modeled at all in the dps spreadsheet.  Both TSD and Dragonspine are modeled with a flat amount of +haste.  So my explanation would be: powerful procs give a significant boost to the value of hit, which is not modeled correctly in the other spreadsheet due to the constraints on it's construction - it is this sort of behavior that is the exact reason I made this spreadsheet.<br>
<br>
...either that, or I messed up.  Time will tell.<br>

	</table>
</div>Short answer: um, apparently so...<br>
<br>
Long answer: the dagger model makes spectacularly inefficient use of the extra SnD uptime (because it's always using 5/5/3 and wasting any extra SnD uptime), so it probably *does* undervalue Netherblade 2/5.  I haven't figured out how the dagger cycle should change with increased energy regen/longer SnD uptime/similar effects - it just always uses 5/5/3<br>
<br>
Now, the sword cycle actually does modify the cycle - it's doing Xs/5r, and computing the optimal X, so the 2/5 bonus is dropping it from ~3s/5r to 1s/5r.  Thing is, most of what that buys you is increased rupture uptime, which isn't a huge dps upgrade - if you look at the 1s/5r, 2s/5r, and 3s/5r cycles in the dps spreadsheet, they're really pretty close in terms of damage output.  So my argument would be: for swords, yes, it really is worth that little.<br>

</div>Yeah.  I'll fix it in the next release.  I was originally gonna have separate sword and dagger column, but I decided it was more elegant to have a single "offense" column that would display the offense numbers for whichever type of weapon you have MH.</div>

</div>Well, that's reassuring - another set of calculations that give similar answers certainly increases my confidence that I didn't screw things up too badly.<br>
<br>
That said, we are a fair bit off in terms of the value of crit, so I was looking at that a bit, and I noticed that your numbers aren't self-consistant... you sure that crit number is right?  Consider:  It takes 22.077 crit rating for 1% crit, so by your numbers 1% crit is worth 22.077*1.74 = 38.41 AP.  40 points of agi also give 1% crit, so the crit on agi is worth 38.41/40 = .96 AP.  Since agi also gives 1 point of AP, the value of a point of agility is then 1.96 AP.  However, 1 point of agi on gear actually gives 1.12 real agi (due to kings and vitality), so the total value for a point of agi on gear is 1.12*1.96 = 2.2 AP, which is significantly higher than the 2.13 value you reported.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Would you mind if I threw together a front page that made equipment selection a bit easier?  I aldready did it so that I could test some of your numbers, but I will keep it to myself if you'd like.<br>
<br>
I'd also find this to be much more helpful if it had some predictive functions.  <br>
<br>
I'd like to see: <br>
<br>
a)relative value of stats based on current equipment (to help pick enchants/gems)<br>
b)ranked list of possible upgrades for specific slots (user chooses)<br>
c)optimal gear composition based on a set of possibilities<br>
<br>
with these three things I think this spreadsheet could really add something that the dps calculator is used to do, but does very poorly/clunkily.<br>
<br>
I'd be happy to help put any of these things together, but I'd like your premission before I do anything beyond make changes for my own personal use.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</div>If you'd like to clean up the UI, that would be fantastic; I've known since about the 2nd day I started working on this sheet that it desparately needed a new UI, but I'm a relative Excel novice so had to settle for strictly functional to start with.  The changes you propose defenitely sounds like they would help.e pie<br>
<br>
With regards to your point c in particular, I think the ideal would be to have a column in the gear sheets that marks where the given item drops, and then generate a "largest upgrades from each location" chart somewhere - i.e., "these are the largest upgrades from heroics", "these are the largest upgrades from karazhan" and so on - then you could just look at which instances are available to you (given current guild progression) and figure out your priority list.  In a totally ideal world it might even specify which boss within the instance drops it, although that might be fancier than is needed.<br>
<br>
I think the talents could also use drop-down boxes to specify your current build rather than the current "fill in a number" system - and, honestly, replacing the "put a 1 in this column if you have it" mechanic with checkboxes might be a good idea too.<br>
<br>
Also, there are some paramaters that are currently hard-coded that could probably use a selection screen somewhere, notably:<br>
<br>
*Character Race (currently hardcoded to NE)<br>
*Boss Armor Value (currently hardcoded to 5k)<br>
*Offense-to-Defense ratio (i.e., how much effective stamina is worth relative to effective AP - it's currently hardcoded to 1 sta = .6 AP, but that should ultimately be tweakable so people who want more or less stamina can do so)<br>
*Avoidable and Mitigable attacks (from the defense sheet; what portion of attacks coming at you can be avoided (dodged) or mitigated (via armor).  I made up numbers, but it might be worth making those adjustable.)<br>
<br>
Another thing that would be worth having is a display somewhere that indicates if the current gear input is over the hit cap, and by how much;  I specifically coded the sheet so that it doesn't immediately drop the score of all your gear with hit rating just because you're at the hit cap; but because of this, you can't easily tell if you're above the hit cap.  As such, there probably should be a warning button for it.<br>
<br>
For that matter, having a display that indicates what cycle it is using for combat swords would probably make sense.<br>
<br>
Basically, in needs a summary screen at the front that gives easy access to most important features and information, such that people don't need to much around in the bowels of the sheet to get useful information out of the sheet.<br>
<br>
...I just realized I named off an awful lot of features that I'd like to see.  Don't feel obligated to do all this - I'm just sort of making a wish list.  But any help you (or anyone) wishes to provide with improving the usability of the sheet would be appreciated, as if you wait for me to figure out enough Excel to get it running, you're gonna be in for a long wait <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304233448im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":)" class="inlineimg">.</div>

</div>I guess I'm not quite seeing what this buys you; I did it this way because I felt it was the clearest way to select what enchant you were using in what slot, and getting an immediate comparison to other enchants available in that slot.

</div>Actually, I think the ideal would be to have a drop-down menu for each socket allowing you to select the socketing for that item, and then have it automatically detect whether the socket bonus should be active.  The challenging part is finding a place to store the socket bonus information; right now it's just lumped in with the other stats of the item.  You'd need some field or set of fields somewhere that describes the socket bonus information, which is then added in if the socketing matches... I just haven't figure out a good way of organizing this.</div>

</div>Yeah - I pulled that number out of the existing rogue dps spreadsheet since it matched my own observations pretty well - I'd pinned it down to agi/40 with a base crit value of about -.29%, as opposed to the current model where the base crit is -11.5/40 = -.2875%<br>
<br>
As an update on the current state of developement of this sheet: Darlal is currently making some significant UI improvements that should make it both easier to use and develop.  He's sent me a rough cut of it, and it looks really good so far.  The 0.3 release will probably consist primarily of his UI changes and the addition of the new items from the test realm that have been found in the past few days; I'm working on resolutions to the current issues with the model (such as the requirement than MH and OH weapons be of the same type, a model for T5 4/5, a dynamically generated dagger cycle, and a fix for the general kludginess of the haste proc model) but have no immediate estimate as to when those will be ready.</div>

		<div id="post_message_359649">I like the simplicity of this spreadsheet.  To be honest, I've always found the "sustained dps" model the other spreadsheet follows to be, well, hyper inflated.  With my gear and max buffs I can attain in a raid environment, the spreadsheet would show numbers in the 1400 range, whereas I can possibly push 940-960 on Mag near the tail end of the encounter.  I understand why the number gets so large, but it isn't something I would like to see, which is the reason you designed your sheet.<br>
<br>
So I guess which is to be trusted?  I feel your sheet, when looking just at base dps, falls more inline with what I am capable of in any given instance on any given boss that sits still for more than a minute.  I like how in perfect situations (read: Gruul with minimal cave-ins) I've reached 900 dps and the sheet tells me I should be getting base 877 with my current gear, no buffs, and about 932 with correct trinkets and typical raid buffs and a few potions.  I feel that's more accurate than the original DPS spreadsheet which shows 990 and 1220 dps, respectively.<br>
<br>
I'm still skeptical, but am glad there is an option to test the original.<br>
<br>
I would like to know why you chose the dagger build you did.  I have always used the following:<br>
<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304064547/http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=w0efooZ0eVbbEz0MMRtV" target="_blank">http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=w0efooZ0eVbbEz0MMRtV</a><br>
<br>
whereas you use something more inline with:<br>
<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304064547/http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=i0gcoLZMIVbbEz0MMRtV" target="_blank">http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=i0gcoLZMIVbbEz0MMRtV</a><br>

which I really don't expect to do more damage.  Mostly based off my own experience, but also of course the original DPS spreadsheet.  Is there numeric backing as to why yours will do more damage?  You also seem to "hardcore" the original Assassination / Combat talents, whereas you leave the remaining to be changed.  Could you provide an option to modify the talents a bit more?<br>

So far, it looks solid.  I'm hoping we get more heads to bang on this sheet and work out the kinks, if any, and provide a more realistic gear comparison sheet.  Great work so far.</div>

</div>Well, my initial comment would be: the two builds you describe are both described fairly well by the sheet.  Yours only differs from what the sheet supports in that it has 3/3 Ruthlessness instead of 2/3 - everything else you can enter in just fine.  And while that certainly is going to make *some* difference in terms of sustained dps output, I don't think it's crippling to the sheet - the answers you get will still be close.<br>
<br>
In terms of the relative merit of the two builds: with the gear I will be wearing as soon as 2.1 comes out, the build you propose is only marginally superior against the targets that murder affects, and clearly inferior against everything else.  In particular, pulling a point out of Lethality to get the last point of Ruthlessness drops me by ~3 dps both buffed and unbuffed.  So while you can argue the merits of dropping Lethality in favor of Murder, I think it is correct to keep Ruthlessness at 2/3 - in which case, you're back in the realm of what the sheet can do.<br>
<br>
As to allowing more talents to be changed: the fundamental issue is one of cycle determination.  The rogue dps spreadsheet computes cycles by simply trying all possible cycles and figuring out which one happens to be best; the problem is, this creates all manner of issues with circular references once you deal with armor penetration procs and the like.  This sheet takes a different approach; it takes the lessons learned in that sheet about which sorts of cycles tend to be optimal, and computes directly what the optimal cycle is going to be.<br>
<br>
The problem with this is: cycles can reasonably be broken down into families (i.e. 5s/5r/Xe, Xs/5r, etc.) and while it is straightforward to compute the optimal member of a given family, it's extremely hard to compare across families.  Hence, the talent selections are constrained so as to keep all possible answers in the same family.<br>
<br>
In the case of swords, for instance: the calculations are built around using Xs/5r as the main cycle.  However, if your energy regeneration is too low, this will not be sustainable.  Hence, the energy-affecting talents (Relentless Strikes, Imp SS, AR, and Combat Potency) are all on the list of required talents; if you don't have these, your energy generation might not be sufficient to sustain 5s/5r, at which point you need to drop down to 5s/5r/3s, which the sheet just simply cannot handle.  The other talents on the "required" list are there for similar reasons - it's because if they were allowed to vary, you'd risk moving out of the range of cycles the sheet is designed to handle.  Hence, I just hardcoded them to what I believed to be the most common values, and let everything else vary.<br>
<br>
Now, as for daggers: I haven't done much work with the cycle model, so I can't tell you for certain which talents are required - I just coded up 5/5/3 with the combat daggers build I use as a rough cut.  Eventually, however, I hope to have a dynamically adjusted family of attack rotations for daggers as I do for swords, at which point what's required may change.  Although, in all honesty, Ruthlessness has a fairly profound effect on dagger rotations, so that one is unlikely to be available for change.<br>
<br>
Long story short: I made as many options as I could changable.  However, the structure of the sheet coerces certain restrictions on talent builds, so I am forces to restrict some as well.</div>

I do notice it's missing a few gems (Bright Living Ruby, Bold Ornate Ruby, Jagged Talasite, notably). Is that just part of 0.3's socketing being non-functional? I'd also prefer that the gems show the stats rather than, or in addition to, the names.

Small UI suggestion. The drop-down arrow on each piece of gear partially covers the rating next to it. If you're just going through each piece seeing how it changes the rating, it's a minor annoyance to click off the selection cell. Making the value cell a bit wider is probably enough of a fix.<br>

General theory to gear selection is to take the best thing that can be gotten out of 5 mans, and anything better - theory being that any serious raider should be at that gear level.

</div>An answer in two parts:<br>
<br>
1) Possibly, although I personally have no idea how to do so.<br>
2) And if you did manage to do it, you'd need to be careful about it; the itemization is restricted in part to keep the players stats within a fairly narrow range, to simplify the calculations.  There is a risk of the cycle computation etc. breaking if your gear is too odd.  This is mostly a problem with OH speed, but if your hit chance gets too low you could also run into trouble.</div>

</div>All the 2.1 stats are in, although some of them are estimated.  The only 2.1 change I haven't fully addressed is the fact that sword spec is a yellow attack now; I changed the sheet to reflect that it no longer resets the swing timer, but I haven't heard any confirmation of which miss rate it uses or whether it can glance; if that has changed, it's not implemented.<br>
<br>
There are some estimates in the sheet as well, that I'd like to pin down better.  In terms of specific mechanics in need of testing:<br>
<br>
Glancing Blow Rate<br>
Glancing Blow Severity<br>
Sword Spec - which miss rate does it use?  can it glance?<br>
Effect of weapon skill<br>
TSD Proc Rate<br>
R+J trinket proc rate<br>
Dragonspine proc rate<br>
Deathmantle 4/5 proc rate<br>
Typical armor for sundered raid bosses<br>

		<div id="post_message_362996">A few things now that I'm looking over .4:<br>
<br>
1. For some reason no matter what I do, I can't get the Thundering Skyfire Gem to activate, and even when I changed the formula to correctly count the colored gems out of their correct cells (and got activate to change to 1) it didn't add the EAP to the talent_gear sheet.<br>
<br>
1a The activation formula for Thundering Skyfire seems to be set at "requires at least 3 gems of every type" - the screenshots I've seen (albiet, I might be missing something having been changed on test) show that it requires at least 4 each of red/blue/yellow gems.<br>
<br>
1b Shifting Nightseye isn't being counted as a red gem, when it should be. (matches red/blue).<br>
<br>
2. Suggestion that you add Drakefang Talisman to the trinket sheet.  With my gear/spec, it's better than the Hourglass (though, that's because my crit rating is in the toilet, but still), and it's roughly equivalent to the Bloodlust Brooch.  I've already added it to my sheet, so I suppose that's totally up to you.<br>
<br>

</div>The cycles are currently coded to very specific rotations; they couldn't even really do Shiv or Hemo, much less Mutilate right now.<br>
<br>
As for the potential for adding such a thing: it would certainly be possible to do so, but it would be a fairly significant amount of work.  I was currently planning to try to clean up the existing features some more (i.e., working through the "known issue" list) before I worried too much about significantly expanding the functionality.  However, if I hear a high level of demand for alternate builds, I might reconsider that course of action.</div>

<br>
In terms of trinkets being counted in the gear values, the current trinkets have a large effect on the relative values of the stats, so in that sense they are included.  <br>
<br>
I will look over TSD issues, I took my 3 number from wowhead (wasn't on ptr), but I'll double check the actual values tonight.  <br>
<br>
I didn't make any updates yesterday due to patch excitement.  I'll have a small amount of time today, but I wouldn't expect anything new until tomorrow realistically.<br>
<br>
In terms of mutilate (which i also use), it would be possible to re-do the cycles for mutilate, but that would be a totally different sheet.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the shifting nightseye catch!  All gems currently should be added to each color they correspond to (notice glinting noble topaz is there twice).<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
In general, keep in mind that all upgrades are scored using your current items.  That means that if changing trinkets would seriously alter the relative value of stats, the optimal upgrades might change.  There are ways for me to suggest overall optimization but they are (a)much better done with a database (if this seems worthwhile I wouldn't be opposed to it), (b) require cyclic arguments, making the sheet very sensitive and especially platform dependent, and (c) make the final results a bit harder to interpret.<br>
<br>
Before making final gear decisions I would change balance-altering items (TSD, warp-spring coil, etc...) first and see if the optimal upgrades remain fairly steady.</div>

</div>I've actually toyed with the idea of moving away from a spreadsheet format to avoid some of the limitations of the format; I think the ideal tool would have an initial UI akin to the old CTProfiles site, i.e., a full talent calculator and character sheet page where you can enter your gear and talents.  It would probably also want to have an option to fetch your current stats and abilities from the Armory.  Then, under the hood, it could go through and do all these calculations in painstaking detail, and provide summary pages indexed by more or less anything you wanted to sort by.  On the whole, I think it would make a pretty cool tool, and while I'd be happy to code the underlying computations, my GUI programming skills aren't up to the level that would be required for the project.  But if anyone wants to work on putting such a thing together, give me a whistle <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080313234049im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":)" class="inlineimg">.<br>
<br>
In terms of optomization strategy: figuring out what, in the long run, is the highest dps option tends not to be particularly hard; the challenge is figuring out how to get from point A to point B.  I generally take an incremental approach and start with my current gear, then add in the largest reasonably obtainable upgrades and see how much this changes things.  In general, the answer is "not too much", but there are some effects (Dragonspine Trophy and TSD, notably) that have a huge impact on the value of stats (hit, in this case) that can change the order of things.<br>
<br>
However, the general optomization strategy for someone in early 25man content tends to work out to:<br>
<br>
1) get Dragonspine Trophy<br>
2) get to the hit cap<br>
3) profit</div>

</div>I'm not sure I'd actually set it up as a webform - it's certainly an option, but I was originially thinking in terms of a program that you'd download and run locally - although that would require either bundling with a database program (probably sqlite) or getting by without a database per se (which would probably be possible if a bit messy).  Running it as a webform would defenitely have some advantages in terms of setup, although also would require resolving issues of hosting and whatever.<br>
<br>
I assume by advantage A you're referring to the ability to support the full range of specs and abilities?  I'd personally be reinclined to redo all the calculations from scratch rather than using his particular formulas, to take full advantage of the flexibility that actual code gives you.  That's to some extent what I was doing here, but the nature of the spreadsheet is such that I had to limit myself to a small slice of rogue-dom.  With the power of actually programming behind it, it would be straightforward to have calculations at or above this level of detail with all possible specs - although it'd take some time to code.<br>
<br>
Regarding the disadvantages: I don't think a) wouldn't really be a problem; we've already started to run into compatability issues with spreadsheets due to the differences between Excel and OpenOffice; I think getting to the same level of compatability would be pretty doable.  A webform would certainly be able to do as well, and even a locally run program could be structured to work on most flavors of Windows and MacOS with relative ease.  Point b) is something of a concern - it would take some time to put such a tool together, but it sounds like we've already found a couple people willing to work on the back-end; if we could find some people to write the front-end this might be possible.</div>

</div>I daresay that it'd take longer than an afternoon anyway; just to get decent models for all the specs would probably take a couple weeks of work - I might be able to do it in a week if I could work on it full time, but between job and raiding that just isn't going to happen.</div>

Anyway, on another topic.  I've been thinking alot about the zone-selection option.  Instead of going with zone-selection I was thinking about using item ilvl to determine what items a player has access too.  In general each zone is +5-10 ilevel over the previous zones (with final bosses being a bit higher than that still).  For instance, if you select ilvl 120, you'd be selecting all gear from 5-mans, heroics, and kara (minus the prince and tier 4).  There could of course be tweaks/exceptions (the prince's drops and tier 4 helms/gloves could be considered ilvl 120 for instence).  What do you think?</div>

Knowing that something drops somewhere in Karazhan is useful; knowing that it drops off Netherspite is even better.  I was thinking of adding two columns to the armor page, one for which general instance things drop in (i.e. SSC, TK, Kara, etc.) which could be used for filtering purposes, and then a second column that would list specific drop information ("Heroic Black Morass", "Netherspite", "Lady Vashj", etc.) So you could, for instance, search for all upgrades in Karazhan, and it would return a list saying:<br>
<br>
Spiteblade is a 50 AP upgrade from Netherspite<br>
Netherblade Helm is a 30 AP upgrade from Prince<br>
etc.<br>

		<div id="post_message_364643">Some quick impressions and comments.<br>
Overall I like the idea a lot. Especially once more specific filtering is enabled. It's tedious at best to sort through all the gear choices looking for upgrades. This tool has the potential to make it far less painful<br>
<br>
However it needs either a simple set of instructions so users can enter gear easily or much more gear. Using me as an example - We're still in Kara, I understand that Black Temple gear is better than what I have now, but if I can't even enter the gear I have now its usefulness seems limited.<br>
<br>
What is the number that it's actually calculating? I noticed that if I leave most of the talents alone at their default values but reduce the poison one to zero I get a value of say 3793. If I then put the poison value back to 3 the value decreases to 3790. I admit the change is very slight, I just don't know why it would go down by making poisons more effective.</div>

		<div id="post_message_364645">The scores are admittedly sort of abstract right now - they're based on AP-equivalent points. So removing the point in poisons drops your dps by about 3AP-equivalent.<br>
<br>
As for adding items - it's admittedly a bit challenging right now.  If there's specific things you feel should be added, feel free to list them and I'll add them; however, please recall that the goal of this sheet is not to include every item that any rogue might have; the itemization starts with level 70 5-man blues, with the idea that these should be obtainable by any remotely serious raider without undo effort.  So if there are specific level 70 blue (or easier to obtain) items you'd like added, I can add them - but I'm not going to put in just anything.</div>

		<div id="post_message_364950">Adding your own items is not as easy as it sounds.  I will try to come up with a writeup of how to do it, but you have to be very careful of named ranges.  Also, given the limitations of excel (and my excel coding knowledge I'm sure), there may be places where items have to be entered muliple times--gems, for instance, need to be entered under each color they apply to.<br>
<br>
In terms of RAP (relative AP) increasing after you removed poison talents, this could be because some of your other stats are slightly more valuable wihtout poison talents.<br>
<br>
For instance, if you have full 5/5 imp 5/5 vile in a mutilate build, a faster offhand is superior in dps by a large margin.  If you have 0/5 imp 0/5 vile, a slower offhand will net you similar, or slightly better dps.  Thus given your weapons, removing poinson talents could actually increase the value of some of your items (sorry for using mutilate, it's what came to mind).</div>

		<div id="post_message_365770">Dragonspine Trophy is such a powerful proc that it greatly increases the value of hit - since misses don't proc.  Hence, you want to miss as little as possible.  In practice, it elevates the value of hit to the point where optimal gear generally allows you to get to the point where you never miss (once your miss rate is 0%, further +hit is useless).  The amount of hit required for this to happen is known as the "hit cap".<br>

The currently accepted value for this (and the one used in this spreadsheet) is that this requires 25.5% total hit; for a rogue with combat potency and weapon expertise but no other sources of +skill, this requires 307.5 hit rating.  Depending on your stats, the exact number will be a bit different.<br>
<br>
"Profit" is an allusion to underwear gnomes, representing the fact that performing the first two steps leads to an advantageous outcome.<br>
<br>
In reality, the situation is a bit more complicated; not all items with +hit are created equal, and once you get to the hit cap their is still a reasonable amount of flexibility in itemization; as a general rule you want to be stacking AP and Agi more than crit past this point, but to get the precise rubrics, a gander at this or the other rogue spreadsheet is recommended.</div>

</div>Eventually, this might be possible.  It's pretty darn hard to do, though.<br>
<br>
First, the daggers case: the fastest possible OHs are 1.3 speed, and you have no poison talents to assign.  DP thus ticks off for 225 (and basically never goes down) every 3 seconds, or 75 dps.<br>
<br>
IP hits for 170, so you need to average 75/170 = .44 procs per second to do as much damage.  Since it procs 20% of the time, this means you need to hit 2.2 times per second.  Assuming you never miss or are dodged (which isn't possible with current itemization), it would require a 2.87x  increase in attack speed over the base speed of the weapon.  You get a 1.3x increase from SnD, 1.025x from pro-rated Blade Flurry, and ~1.02x from average mongoose uptime on both hands.  This means that you need to get roughly a 2.11x increase in weapon speed from haste rating, which requires 1167 haste rating to obtain.  Even if you somehow managed 100% uptime on both TSD and Dragonspine, that's only 565, and there's just not enough haste rating on other items to get another 600, nor do I expect there to be anytime soon.<br>
<br>
Now, sword spec, optimally speaking, gets 4 points to put in poison talents, so the relevant comparison is DP with 4/5 Vile vs IP with 4/5 Imp.  Deadly Poison with 4/5 Vile ticks off for 261 every 3 seconds, which is 87 dps, which requires .512 procs per second; with a 28% proc rate and assuming attacks never miss or are dodged, this requires 1.83 attacks per second.  With the fastest possible sword OH (1.4 speed), this would require 2.56x attack speed increase, which works out to about.... 928 haste rating.  Again, that's still well out of reach of current itemization.<br>
<br>
So, briefly: From a theoretical perspective, it's possible, but in practice, it ain't gonna happen.</div>

</div>Oh wow, I didn't realize that's what that column meant.  Thanks. :]<br>
<br>
I guess it would be difficult, but is there a way for the spreadsheet to know if your meta gem is active?  The way it suggests I set up my gems would turn off my meta, so I can't go for the optimal setup.  I try not to rely on sheets too much, anyway, but it's just something I noticed.<br>
<br>
And the reason the optimal is being showed as negative is because it suggests I use Cat's Swiftness rather than Dexterity... if you assigned a value to the run speed higher than 6 agility's worth, then that would fix the problem, I think.  It is difficult to come up with a value for runspeed as the whole purpose is sustained nonmobile dps.  Perhaps just make it such that Cat's Swiftness isn't suggested?</div>

		<div id="post_message_366519">There is no value associated with the speed increase, and I don't think there are any plans to add one.  The purpose of this sheet is to optimize gear for damage, not additional effects.<br>
<br>
Meta gems:  Currently the sheet does track which gems are active, but it does not use this information anyplace.  The reason for this is that it gets really difficult to optimize gear with 3 rounds of iteration without switching to a database (see previous discussion).<br>
<br>
For example:<br>
<br>
here's what the statement is:<br>
if Added RAP (relative attack power) from best metagem &gt; RAP lost by replacing gems with other color gems -&gt; resocket gear to activate the gems<br>
<br>
what we do currently:<br>
<br>
a) determine the RAP of current armor ungemmed<br>
b) determine if it is better to socket the armor with all of the top gem, or to get the socket bonus<br>
c) determine which metagems are active with this configuration<br>
______________________________________________________<br>
<br>
this is what we would need to do:<br>
<br>
a) determine the RAP of current armor ungemmed<br>
b) determine if it is better to socket the armor with all of the top gem, or to get the socket bonus<br>
c) determine which metagems are active with this configuration<br>
d) compare current total value with total value using the best metagem<br>
     i) figure out what gems need to be added to activate the best metagem<br>
     ii) figure out which gems provide the least RAP difference when replaced (this needs to include socket bonuses)<br>
    <br>
adding D requires a full gemming module, not a string of if-&gt;then logic.  It's not impossible, but it's not in at the moment.<br>
<br>
The easiest way to do this in excel that I can think of is to create a matrix of gemming options (alreaady parially done) for each armor piece.<br>
<br>
Create a new matrix of all values and counts of gems for each color that would activate the optimal meta gem that includes socket bonuses (this is not easy and requires sorting options that basic excel doesn't seem to have).<br>
<br>
Compare the sum of the individual maximums with the sum of the meta-active maximums.<br>
<br>
Anyway, it's not impossible, but it's not something that will be done right away.  Just use common sense and replace your weakest gems first.</div>

</div>Could you perhaps filter a cell check for said unique gems? If equipped then it wont show as an option? Or perhaps you could give the top three gem upgrades in a drop down. This would allow this gem to show as an upgrade, and provide the next best choices. <br>

That way pure PvE folks won't get their gear selections filled by PvP gear etc. It would also help eliminate slow pokes like me who are in Kara not seeing a list full of SS gear.</div>

		<div id="post_message_368392">Yes, it currently pays no attention to the hit cap.  When I was writing the initial version, it kept confusing the heck out me that the value of a piece of gear would suddenly drop by a third the instant you hit the hit cap, which isn't an accurate assessment of the situation at all; the value of that piece of gear is as high as ever, it's just that the combination of gear you happen to be using has a little too much +hit on it.  So I specifically calculated the incremental value of hit in a way that ignores the hit cap entirely.<br>
<br>
The problem with this solution, of course, is that it'll keep recommending high hit items even after you're hit capped, so specific upgrades off whatever gear you happen to be wearing might not actually be upgrades due to the hit mechanics.  It's not clear to me if there's a better way of doing this in the end, since high hit items *are* good and *should* score highly - they just shouldn't be recommended as upgrades for people already at the hit cap. Unfortunately, I can't think of any good way of writing that into the spreadsheet.<br>
<br>
As a short term solution, we're planning on adding a message warning you when you're over the hit cap, so at least you're aware that there's an issue.</div>

That way you could have a simple if-statement to make decisions on the upgrade item part once you hit the hit-cap.

</div>Not really, no.  In addition to moving all the forumlas, you need to redefine the named ranges to include the new items.  Also, copying the forumlas straight over tends not to work exactly, since not all the formulas have dollar signs everywhere they're needed to make the formulas directly copy.<br>
<br>
Honestly, given the frequency with which new releases of the sheet are coming out right now, the recommended way of getting an item into the sheet is to post it in this thread, and I'll add it the next release (assuming it strikes me as worth adding, anyway - again, I'm trying to limit this to 5-man blues and up).</div>

<br>
But what i would appreciate most would be something showing hit-rating / hit% on the gear page or a piece of code preventing us going over 25.5% hit to make sure you dont waste itemvalue. Something like 2 value colums, so you can evalute when you hit the cap to drop a low value hit item and grap a high value hit item, exchanging the low value hit item with another high value no hit dps piece.<br>

		<div id="post_message_368424">Okay - I'll make a point to add those next release.  I punched them into a copy of the sheet I have on hand, and as a short answer:<br>
<br>
Don Alejandro's is comperable to Belt of One Thousand Deaths<br>
Hyjal Rings, at least at the rep levels in Wowhead, aren't particularly interesting.<br>
Shadowmoon Destoyer's Drape and Telonicus's Pendant of Mayhem are the best available pieces for their slot that I've seen to date.<br>
Terrok's Might is crap.<br>
Leggings of Murderous Attempt are a slight dps upgrade over T5 and a significant sta downgrade, causing their composite score to be almost identical.<br>
<br>
As a tip: one thing that works well if you want to compare new pieces of gear is to replace one of the existing items in the sheet - just pick an item that there's no chance you're going to use, and overwrite the name + stats with the new gear.  I.e., if you want to add more items below the low end of the sheet, overwrite some of the high end items that you won't get to for a while; if you want to add more high-end items, ovewrite some of the low-end blues that are inferior to what you have.</div>

</div>It's what I refer to as EAP - that would be "Effective Attack Power".  I've always normalized my calculations with 1 AP = 1 point rather than 1 Agi = 1 point (as is true for AEP), so that's what I did in the sheet.  <br>
<br>
The problem I have with AEP is that Agility provides both offensive and defensive benefits, so it's hard to separate the benefits of an item into offensive and defensive; therefore, I score offense in effective AP, defense in effective Stamina, and then combine them to get an overall score that is normalized so 1 AP = 1 point. <br>

If you don't mind doing a bit of digging, you can also read through the thread to find when things were released, since I also make a new post in the thread when a new release comes out.<br>

However, while releases are still coming fast and furious (as they are now) I'll try to remember to post dates in the initial post as well; once we get to a stable version I'll probably stop doing that, but for the moment it probably does make sense.</div>

</div>True.... but this sheet is designed to model sustained DPS.  It's true, in a 5 min fight, the activated trinkets will be a bit better than stated.  However, it's also true that in a 5 min fight, to get totally accurate answers, one would need to model the initial ramp-up of cycles and poison, which is probably a larger effect.  This sheet makes no effort to do so; it, like most spreadsheets of it's type, assumes that fights are going to be "long" - as in, of sufficient duration that such edge effects are negligible.  <br>
<br>
Besides which, fights significantly longer than 5 min are commonplace in the expansion; for instance, Hydross + Leotharas both run 8-10 min, and Tidewalker + Mag are even longer than that (my guild had one Tidewalker kill that ran almost 15 min).<br>
<br>
So, long story short?  Yes, for short fights the sheet is inaccurate - for reasons that go beyond the simple issues with activated trinkets - becase short fights is not what it's designed to model.</div>

I might be wrong, but that's at least what I've always held as the most optimal build. 40% chance to get an extra point isn't enough to rely on for cycles, and as combat daggers you use so few finishers that you don't really get a whole lot out of the talent.

		<div id="post_message_370277">If you're sustaining 5/5/3 without 2/3 ruthlessness, I'm impressed...<br>
<br>
Assuming no 2/5 Netherblade, a 5 pt SnD lasts 30.45 seconds, and a 3 point SnD lasts 21.75 seconds.  Thus the total SnD uptime is 52.2 seconds, in which time one needs to land 13 Backstabs (costing 780 energy) plus 10 extra energy (on average) for the 3-pt SnD.  Hence, to sustain 5/5/3 with no SnD downtime, one would need to generate 790 energy every 52.2 seconds, or roughly 15.1 energy per second.  Base regen is 10 energy per second (or 10.5 if you factor in AR, which you probably shouldn't given in the interest of measuring sustained cycles, but what the heck, I'll give it to you).  So that means combat potency would need to replenish 4.6 energy per second, which requires 1.54 offhand hits per second.  Due to the base 5% dodge rate, this means you need to launch 1.62 offhand attacks per second.<br>
<br>
The fastest possible dagger OH is 1.3 speed; to launch 1.62 OH attacks per second with such a weapon would require attacking at 2.11 times the normal speed.  SnD gives 1.3x, Blade Flurry (again, not really fair to include for sustained cycles, but whatever) gives 1.025x, and typical mongoose uptime for 2 weapons gives another (roughly) 1.02x.  Hence, one would need to get 55.5% haste from haste rating - also known as 584 haste rating.  Dragonspine and Thundering Skyfire together give maybe 200.  So unless there's some way to pick up 384 haste rating from gear, 5/5/3 is *not* sustainable without Ruthlessness - at least, not without dropping SnD uptime.  Hence, 2/3 Ruthlessness is required to allow 5/5/3 as a reasonable cycle.<br>
<br>
As for why not 3/3 - well, 2/3 *is* enough for 5/5/3, and getting 3/3 would require taking points out of Imp Backstab (bad), Relentless Strikes (worse), or Lethality... but since there's no cycles opened up by 3/3, I'd rather have the extra point in Lethality.</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->So, an answer in a couple parts:<br>
<br>
Depending on your guild's strategy and luck, Magtheridon, Tidewalker, and Hydross are all decently approximated by 10 min uninterrupted dps.  Karathress is perhaps more accurately 4 fights each 2-3 min long, and Leotharas is just plain interrupted and spotty.  Void Reaver has frequent interruptions but said interruptions are fairly short.  And I haven't seen any of the other fights in the expansion yet - perhaps someone in a more advanced guild than I (koaschten, perhaps?) can comment on the nature of the later TK fights and/or Hyjal and Black Temple.<br>
<br>
So, while there are certainly some fights that are highly interrupted, there are also quite a few that aren't.  So a purely sustained model is somewhat reasonable for a nontrivial number of fights in the expansion.  Hence, the sustained model does have some value.<br>
<br>
Admittedly, however, it would be potentially worthwhile to deal with shorter and/or more interrupted fights than this spreadsheet is designed to handle.  To be perfectly honest, this is exactly the complaint I raised against the initial Rogue DPS spreadsheet when I first saw it - consider, for instance, the following statement by me in my guild forums, last October:<br>
<br>
<!-- BEGIN TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->
<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px; ">
	<div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom:0px"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20110810160038im_/http://flex.cdn.elitistjerks.com/images/chestnut/misc/citation.gif" border="0"></div>
	<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" border="0" width="100%">
	<tr>
		<td class="alt2" style="border:1px inset">
			
				...as near as I can tell, it's computing DPS in an abstracted situation that doesn't actually occur in any real fight. The assumptions about sustainability aren't even valid for Patchwerk, much less any other fight. It's calculating the numbers assuming, roughly speaking, a fight of infinite length against a stationary target with no tea use. Whereas in practice, the longest uninterrupted stationary fight we have is Patchwerk at 7 minutes, and that's short enough that the edge effects do matter. So, yes, as a theoretical exercise in damage computation, it's fine - but has nothing to do with any real situation, even neglecting the issues of stamina and survivability.
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</div>
<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->Now, looking back: 1) I was overstating the case slightly and 2) I think this is less true now than it was then, but I'm certainly willing to concede that it's a valid gripe.<br>
<br>
The problem is: computing anything else is a whole heck of a lot harder.  My solution to the problem then was to totally neglect any notion of cycles and just straight parse fights to figure out how often I was using each attack, and a parameter in the spreadsheet that allowed me to tweak this value to customize gear to each fight.  The problem is, many of the newer effects and abilities (notably, haste procs such as Mongoose/Dragonspine Trophy/Thundering Skyfire Diamond and energy procs like Combat Potency) just cannot be modeled through these approaches, because they fundamentally change the ratio of white to yellow attacks.  Hence, the approach of counting attacks just doesn't work - one actually needs to look at the attack order and cycles.  But to come up with general cycles - across a range of gear selection - for a fight only one or two minutes long, turns out to be extremely challenging.  And even if you figure it out for 1 min fights, you'd need to figure it out again for 2 min fights, and for 3 min fights, and for fights separated by 15 seconds, or 1 min, or 5 min.  And unless you do this all carefully and precisely, the answers you get aren't really going to be any better.<br>
<br>
Finally: even assuming I did know how to write a tool more specific to short fights, and that such a thing would be more accurate for significant numbers of fights, I'm honestly not sure if it's worth the effort.  This sheet is designed as a tool, not the ultimate answer to all questions rogue.  It will, in general terms, allow you to compare gear, and help you towards optomizing your DPS while maintaining survivability - but I make no claims that it's accurate to more than a couple AP-equivalent anyway.  For the general sorts of comparisons it's designed for (i.e. is it worth losing the WW 2/5 bonus to upgrade WW shoulders to Deathmantle) it's going to give answers that are just as helpful as the more focused tool.  And for the more subtle questions (which is better, Veteran's Musket or Prince Bow) where the answer is only 2-3 EAP apart, I wouldn't trust any spreadsheet to always get the answer right.<br>
<br>
So, stated briefly: while this sheet isn't a 100% accurate model of all possible cases, I believe it is sufficiently close to still be a useful tool - such that I don't think it warrants the (considerable) effort it would require to make a good interrupted-fight SS.</div>

We were unable to resolve all the issues with OO compatability, so as a quick fix I generated a second version of the sheet that works in OO (but not Excel).  Hence, there are two download links:<br>
<br>
Excel Version: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110810160038/http://www.savefile.com/files/772881" target="_blank">http://www.savefile.com/files/772881</a><br>

<br>
Changes:<br>
*Sheet now supports mixing weapons of different types (i.e. Sword MH and Dagger OH, or vice versa)<br>
*Socketing has been redone - this should resolve the issues with socketing in the previous verison.<br>
*More accurate model of Windfury added<br>
*Sword Spec adjusted to reflect the fact that Sword Spec hits are yellow attacks and cannot glance.<br>
*Assorted bugs in calculation sheets corrected.<br>
*"Optimal" and "Suggested Upgrade" columns should now give more accurate values.<br>
*New items added.<br>
*Thundering Skyfire Diamond updated to have a 40 sec internal cooldown; this is an approximate value until the behavior is totally modeled, but it more accurately reflects the power of the gem than did the old model.<br>
*Issue with enchants of the same name has been corrected.<br>
*Indicator of current hit rating and whether you are at the hit cap added to main page.<br>
*And probably some other stuff too - I don't recall everything that's been changed over the last couple weeks.</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->It was like this before the buff... Swords have been better since BC came out and 1.4-5 speed offhands fell into our laps.<br>
<br>
I don't think a 5% extra attack mechanic was developed with the idea of proccing from a weapon twice as slow in your main hand (with no offhand damage penalty.)<br>
Also, it's not completely accurate. We don't know if sword spec procs windfury, we don't know if it procs combat potency... We hardly know that sword spec doesn't proc off of itself.<br>
<br>
Really a strength of a combat swords build that I doubt even a handful of people have realized yet is how optimal the combo point generation is.<br>
<br>
With rupture becoming such an important and clear choice over eviscerate and combat potency changing cp generation drastically a few months ago, what has really changed?<br>
<br>
An ideal build will give just enough points to toss up a 5 point rupture just as the preceeding rupture falls off while having a hundred percent slice uptime. Now I think daggers are too slow and mutilate is too fast for this.<br>
<br>
Course that's just my speculation. Haven't done the math and could be wrong.</div>

		<div id="post_message_373234" class="post_message_underline">I've been messing around with the spreadsheet for quite a while now, and it's very nicely done. Couple little gripes I have with it however:<br>
<br>
First off I believe that because of the way in which hit was calculated it is slightly overvalued. You use a method of generating the dps gain form 1 hit rating by decreasing the hit value, which because of the semi-linear properties of +hit makes the calculations slightly off.<br>
<br>
Simple change for this would be to take the +13/205 off H35 and H31 and change H7 to read "=$B$7+1" Might be off as to your reasonings for doing this, but would make it a little more accurate.<br>
<br>
Second, I don't know why, but I can not get my AP to match up to my in game tab on the Dagger Calc sheet. Taking off all buffs form the sheet, and seeing that all gems/items/enchants are correct it still won't show my character sheet number. It's always lower than expected!<br>
<br>
One last thing to mention would be that each time you release a new sheet, I always add drop down boxes to the buff sheet to make it a little easier to use, as well as alternating lines of color to better choose between the buffs. Just little UI things that can make the sheet much more user friendly.<br>
<br>
Great job on it though, I love to see all the calculations out there to go over and examine! Keep up the awesome work!</div>

<br>
To LiteSabre, what stat balance are you using?  If you are using Total, agility and hit become so close in value (for a large chunk of gear) that the sheet will sometimes give what seem to be either conflicting or circular results.  I personally really only use the "offensive" setting, which gives no value to defensive stats like stamina.</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->"Optimal" doesn't refer to the best possible gear you could be wearing.  It refers to the best possible gemming/enchanting of what you are wearing.  The reason there is an "optimal hit" number is to warn you if the gem combination it's recommending excedes the hit cap (in which case it's wrong about what's optimal; it has no way of knowing about the hit cap, so will keep recommending hit gems no matter how much you have.  The general solution is to start replacing hit gems with agi gems relative to it's recommendation until you're under the hit cap.<br>
<br>
So, it's not asserting that 272 is the absolute maximum useful haste value; merely that with your current gear, the best possible socketing yields 272 hit rating.<br>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->Agreed; I found this to be true of the Rogue DPS spreadsheet as well.  I think it's in no small part due to the fact that swords just have access to vastly more efficient cycles; 5/5/3 is not a particularly good cycle, but it's the best that combat daggers can do; when you get to 5s/5r there's a signficant damage boost, and the ability to further drop the length of the SnD to compress the cycle even further just favors swords all the more.<br>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->Yes; the sheet currently assumes that sword spec can proc all the other proc effects you may have, which may or may not be accurate, and whether it's true or not would create a fairly large disparity in dps; rogue DPS is heavily influenced due to the large number of powerful procs available right now (Dragonspine, Mongoose, Poisons, etc.)<br>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->So, the reason why it's done the way it is is to prevent the value of hit rating from going to zero the moment you touch the hit cap; while it's true that the *incremental* value of hit goes to zero at that point, the value of the first 300 points shouldn't change; as such, I subtract the amount of hit granted by 1 hit rating after performing the floor of the the hit cap to ensure that a valid result is always obtained.<br>
<br>
In terms of whether it's less accurate: the only difference between what it's doing and what you recommend (assuming you're not at the hit cap) is that this way measures the damage lost by you hit going down by 1, and your way measures the damage gained by hit going up by 1; either is as accurate as the other.  In reality, we should be taking the derivative at the point itself rather than doing either, but since that's not practical, going one step in either direction is equally valid.<br>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->If you're refering to the stats at the top of the cacls page - that's honestly not *too* surprising to me.  The stats on the calc page are in some sense "raw stats" - they're not computed in quite the same way as the ones on your character sheet.  For instance, Agi and Sta don't factor in Vitality at the top; this it added further down the page.  AP includes a time-averaged portion of any activated AP effects such as Bloodlust Brooch.  I think there are a few other things like that as well.<br>
<br>
That said, it's also possible there's a bug; I'll look through it and see if I can find anything.  We already corrected a couple of issues that were causing stats to be added incorrectly in the last revision; it's entirely possible that we missed something so it's still a bit off.<br>

<br>
To LiteSabre, what stat balance are you using?  If you are using Total, agility and hit become so close in value (for a large chunk of gear) that the sheet will sometimes give what seem to be either conflicting or circular results.  I personally really only use the "offensive" setting, which gives no value to defensive stats like stamina.</div>

An interesting thing to note is that when I set the sheet to combat swords with the BT MH/Hyjal OH, it gave me an optimal hit rating of 372, far above the hit cap. I have no idea what happened to cause this.</div>

				Agreed; I found this to be true of the Rogue DPS spreadsheet as well. I think it's in no small part due to the fact that swords just have access to vastly more efficient cycles; 5/5/3 is not a particularly good cycle, but it's the best that combat daggers can do; when you get to 5s/5r there's a signficant damage boost, and the ability to further drop the length of the SnD to compress the cycle even further just favors swords all the more.

				So, the reason why it's done the way it is is to prevent the value of hit rating from going to zero the moment you touch the hit cap; while it's true that the *incremental* value of hit goes to zero at that point, the value of the first 300 points shouldn't change; as such, I subtract the amount of hit granted by 1 hit rating after performing the floor of the the hit cap to ensure that a valid result is always obtained.

		<div id="post_message_368392" class="post_message_underline">Yes, it currently pays no attention to the hit cap.  When I was writing the initial version, it kept confusing the heck out me that the value of a piece of gear would suddenly drop by a third the instant you hit the hit cap, which isn't an accurate assessment of the situation at all; the value of that piece of gear is as high as ever, it's just that the combination of gear you happen to be using has a little too much +hit on it.  So I specifically calculated the incremental value of hit in a way that ignores the hit cap entirely.<br>
<br>
The problem with this solution, of course, is that it'll keep recommending high hit items even after you're hit capped, so specific upgrades off whatever gear you happen to be wearing might not actually be upgrades due to the hit mechanics.  It's not clear to me if there's a better way of doing this in the end, since high hit items *are* good and *should* score highly - they just shouldn't be recommended as upgrades for people already at the hit cap. Unfortunately, I can't think of any good way of writing that into the spreadsheet.<br>
<br>
As a short term solution, we're planning on adding a message warning you when you're over the hit cap, so at least you're aware that there's an issue.</div>

</div>Not really, no.  In addition to moving all the forumlas, you need to redefine the named ranges to include the new items.  Also, copying the forumlas straight over tends not to work exactly, since not all the formulas have dollar signs everywhere they're needed to make the formulas directly copy.<br>
<br>
Honestly, given the frequency with which new releases of the sheet are coming out right now, the recommended way of getting an item into the sheet is to post it in this thread, and I'll add it the next release (assuming it strikes me as worth adding, anyway - again, I'm trying to limit this to 5-man blues and up).</div>

But what i would appreciate most would be something showing hit-rating / hit% on the gear page or a piece of code preventing us going over 25.5% hit to make sure you dont waste itemvalue.

<br>
Don Alejandro's is comperable to Belt of One Thousand Deaths<br>
Hyjal Rings, at least at the rep levels in Wowhead, aren't particularly interesting.<br>
Shadowmoon Destoyer's Drape and Telonicus's Pendant of Mayhem are the best available pieces for their slot that I've seen to date.<br>
Terrok's Might is crap.<br>
Leggings of Murderous Attempt are a slight dps upgrade over T5 and a significant sta downgrade, causing their composite score to be almost identical.<br>
<br>
As a tip: one thing that works well if you want to compare new pieces of gear is to replace one of the existing items in the sheet - just pick an item that there's no chance you're going to use, and overwrite the name + stats with the new gear.  I.e., if you want to add more items below the low end of the sheet, overwrite some of the high end items that you won't get to for a while; if you want to add more high-end items, ovewrite some of the low-end blues that are inferior to what you have.</div>

This actually brings me to question this.  Even with having weapon skill and it's benefits so up in the air would you rank the Belt of Deep Shadow over the Vashj belt?  Obviously at a point where the Belt of Deep Shadow puts you over the hit cap and some of it's +hit goes to waste the Vashj belt is superior, but even with that said, some other items could be switched around.<br>

Do you guys really rank the Belt of Deep Shadow above the Belt of One-Hundred Deaths?  When I use Pf's spreadsheet I see the Belt of One Hundred Deaths coming out about 4-5 DPS ahead and that is with the weapon skill post UNchecked.<br>
<br>
Here is what I've come up with based on my own numbers.  This is using my(<b>DISCLAIMER: The AEP used only applied to my current gear setup</b>) unbuffed AEP listed by pf's spreadsheet.  The only AEP ratio I use in this however is .58AP = 1AGI= 1AEP.  Stamina is ignored.<br>
<br>
Looking at just the Agility and AP on both of the belts:<br>
<br>
Agility first:<br>
Vashj: 29agi = 29AEP<br>
Crafted: 32agi = 32AEP<br>
 <br>
Attack Power:<br>
Vashj: 74AP *.58 = 42.92 AEP + 29AEP(listed above) = 71.92AEP<br>
Crafted: 66AP *.58 = 38.28 AEP + 32AEP(listed above) = 70.28AEP<br>
<br>
At this point, for my current gear setup, Vashj is slightly ahead.  Obviously this isn't the case for a lot of gear setups and doesn't take in account raid/buff scaling either.<br>
<br>
The socket bonuses are the same and I prefer the red and blue versus the 2 blue on the crafted.  So again, Vashj is slightly ahead with my current setup.<br>
<br>
Now for the +hit versus the +wep skill rating.<br>
<br>
+18hit gives roughly +1.141% hit (18/15.77)<br>
 <br>
So, +1.141% hit on the crafted belt.<br>
<br>
-------------------<br>
<br>
+25 Weapon skill rating translates in to roughly 6.3414 wep skill.<br>
<br>
+6.3414 wep skill with the most recent and basic (still data to be observed for this) understanding of weapon skill gives us something around:<br>
  +.63% hit<br>
  +.25% crit<br>
  -.25% dodge (or is it -.50%?)<br>
<br>
-------------------<br>
The +1.70 AEP that the Vashj belt was ahead previously can all be changed with different gear/raid buffs, etc and the socket colors will also change value as new gems come out.  Therefore, in my opinion, it comes down to comparing +1.14% hit and +.63% hit, +.25% crit, -.25% dodge(something you can only get from weapon skill and not taken away post hit cap)<br>
<br>
<br>
What do you guys think?  The main thing that makes me want to stick with Vashj is that there are benefits from the +wep skill rating that will not be removed post 308hit (wexp/precision).  Honestly, I think I might be a bit biased though, because I'm very hopeful toward weapon skill being worth a flip.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">There's some sort of bug with gear values.<br>

I have a belt of deep shadow... select it as equipped and the vashj belt is noted a downgrade.<br>
Select the vashj belt and the belt of deep shadow is now noted as a downgrade.<br>
<br>
I figure what happens is the stats on the belts synergize in a way that the next stat sheet doesnt capture it. IE: 25 weapon skill on vashj belt is not as valuable as what belt of deep shadow has to offer instead but becomes more valuable as the other stats from vashj belt are considered.<br>
<br>
<br>
Guess it's not really a bug, but - Intended? Known?<br>
Simple little thing but when the sheet shows something as a downgrade it can make a big deal?</div>

</div>You've hit the nail on the head.  All values are done based on your current stats, so changing your gear will change the values.  For items tha are very close in value, the behavior you describe is expected.  I know this seems strange, but there really isn't a good way around it in spreadsheet form.  To go all the way we'd need to either use macros or just plain use a database (discussed around page 3).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>So, couple of points here:<br>
<br>
1) Due to the nature of procs and the like, I'm fairly certain that 1% hit is actually superior to 1% crit right now, and comperable to -dodge (slightly less since -dodge also effects yellow attacks, but that's a reasonably minor effect since a dodged yellow attack only costs you about 20% of the damage of the attack).  So you're comparing 1.14% hit to 1.13% of other mods - looks pretty even, to me.  Which, conveniently, is what the spreadsheet seems to be showing for most people - they're within a couple of AP.<br>
<br>
2) Any rogue that's looking to make this decision is in a position where they're starting to pick up Tier 5, which has very little +hit on it.  The rogues in my guild that have started to pick up T5 have found their hit drops considerably - one rogue in my guild was at 309 hit last week, and having picked up T5 shoulders + legs is down to 273, even after reshuffling some other gear to get more hit.  So I'm of the opinion that the hit cap is somewhat less of a concern for such rogues.<br>
<br>
3) On the other hand, we *don't* understand weapon skill very well, so it's entirely possible that the value of Vashj belt is higher than we are estimating.<br>
<br>
In the end, I would say: they're pretty comperable.  There's probably a slight argument to be made in favor of the Vashj belt, but it's very very close - once I got one, I wouldn't bother with getting the other until no one else needed it.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I'm not sure I agree with that.  I'm a rogue that is in a "position" to pick one up and the only immediate piece of t5 I'll be grabbing will be the gloves, which is a +hit upgrade.  According to both pf's and your spreadsheet the Stranger shoulders, which I currently use, rank higher than the t5 shoulders.  I'll be content with Brigand's BP over deathmantle as well.  I guess once I can get enough pieces to put together a 4pc I'll be taking a big loss in +hit, so I see your point there.<br>
<br>
Either way, I really wish we had some more data on +wep skill. Not knowing for sure the impact +wep skill makes bugs me.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_376175"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Stranger shoulders are better for dagger rogues, sure.  They *also* have no hit.<br>
<br>
I mean, I'm not saying that you can't still reach the hit cap in T5 - just that it's not quite so immediate a concern as it is for some less-geared rogues.  I mean, I could hit 350 hit without even resocketing anything with current gear, and could probably break 400 if I really wanted to - in fact, if I get the next couple of upgrades in the wrong order, I'm going to wind up in a situation where I'll be hard-pressed *not* to have 320+ hit rating.  At Karazhan/T4 levels of gear you have to work *not* to be hit-capped.  When you get up to T5 level itemization, this is less true, I think.  BBV has lots of hit, to be sure, but not a whole lot of other things do.  Given which, I think it's fair to say that the fact that Belt of Deep Shadow has hit rather than other mods is not a particularly large disadvantage.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

The fact that weapon skill allows you to get more hit on your gear is something that's not counted, and kind of a big deal. <br>
<br>
(If hit is worth .3 more ap than agi on your sheet then every point of hit the weapon skill allows you to get over the cap adds .3 more APEP to your weapon skill item.)

a) +skill converts dodges to misses, or<br>
b) +skill converts dodges to hits.<br>
<br>
In the first case, the weapon skill itself provides no benefit other than raising the hit cap, because dodges and misses both do no damage.  Hence no damage is directly added, but an equal amount of value is gained by raising the hit cap.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, in the 2nd case, the weapon skill provides no benefit to the hit cap, but adds damage directly<br>
<br>
Either way, it's modeled.  Personally, I'd be willing to bet that it converts dodges to hits, because that fits better with the understood mechanics.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Fair enough about Stealther's Helmet and I understand why you'd want to keep the blue items at a minimum. Thing with the Assassination set though is it's probably the most common blue items people have for the slots when starting to raid. My guild is currently in SSC and all our rogues still have at least one piece of Assa set or the Stealther's helm (new metagems are nice but on the other hand  they seem a waste to put on something you're planning to replace as a priority).

Would re-gemming my gear according to the "Optimal Hit" would actually give me the best dps in theory?<br>

"Optimal Hit" != "0% miss for boss mobs"?<br>

EDIT: Well yeah because I put my gear into the spreadsheet and it tells me my optimal hit is 227, but I already have 256(and I was still aiming to get more &gt;.&gt;), so I'm confused right now to whether re-gem to lower hit or...?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Given that, the sheet tells me that I should go from my 308 hit down to 252 by replacing every Rigid Dawnstone with a Bright Living Ruby because the Dawnstone is currenly worth 15.24 APE vs. the Ruby's 16 APE.

</div>The problem here is that the AP values of the gems are based off of your current total stats.  All the sheet is telling you is that you have geared your hit beyond the point where 1 HR is better than 2 AP, given your resulting total AP.<br>
<br>
As soon as you change *one* Rigid Dawnstone to a bright ruby, the value of every rigid dawnstone will rise to more than 15.24.<br>
<br>
If you just replace them one at a time, and watch the value of rigid dawnstone each time you switch one, you should reach a point where rigid dawnstone is almost exactly 16.  That's where you stop.<br>
<br>
If you replace them all, you will probably see it recommending that you change them back, because a Rigid Dawnstone will be worth more than 16 AP at that point.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Sure, it might only be the difference of a 7 APE change if I did it, but at this point a Netherblade Chestpiece is a 7 APE upgrade for me.  Also since the value of some items are based around the fact that they have sockets, and the way you socket them is what makes them truely worthwhile, this is certainly important.</div>

</div>There was some data in the Rogue DPS spreadsheet thread that indicated that most bosses were around 7k-8k unsundered, which would put them at about 5k sundered.

</div>Yeah, that through me off a bit at first - we're looking into a way to fix it.  We decided not to worry about it for the initial release since, as you say, it's not so much a bug as a slightly confusing display issue, and we felt that it was better to get the zone filters out so people could play with them and give feedback rather than waiting a couple days until we'd fixed that.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I had glanced at the Buffs page, but it might have been scrolled over because I didn't see the yes/no column that I see now, playing with the buffs I can see that the value of hit changes favorably with pretty standard melee buffs.

Sure, the smart ones will just buy Fel Leather but they don't know that unless you put it in here, right? <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100304125741im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":)" class="inlineimg"><br>
<br>
And Band of Exorcist is one of those items that's so good compared to it's level and how easy it is to get it would be a shame not to include.<br>
<br>
I do share your sentiment about Stealther's Helmet of Second Sight though.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Optimal Hit reflects the amount of hit rating if you socketed and enchanted your current gear optimally.  For exactly what is considered to be optimal for you, consult the middle gear column.  So, yes, given the buffs you have selected and the gear you have equipped, the spreadsheet feels you would do more damage by gemming for less hit.<br>
<br>
Optimal Hit *doesn't* have anything to do with the hit cap - is just an indication of how much hit you'd have if you socketed according to the recommendations in the middle column.  This is primarily intended as a warning mechanism, as, in general, "optimal" involves socketing stuff with a whole lot of +8 hit gems, which will frequently put you over the hit cap - the Optimal Hit number is designed to warn you about this so you know not to socket so overwhelmingly with hit.</div>

</div>Might I also ask that you include what color slots a certain type of armor has? e.g. (Netherblade Facemask, 1M 1R).<br>
<br>
<br>
Or maybe color the cells according to the color of the gems, if it's not too troublesome.<br>
<br>
Well, more like a GUI update though. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100304125741im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":)" class="inlineimg"><br>
<br>
<br>
On the other hand, is it possible that you make a warning or some sort when you change a gem and will result in deactivating your current meta gem? And also take into account the meta gem requirements for recommended gems. <br>
<br>
Thanks alot for the work both of you have put in, it's a great spreadsheet ;P<br>

EDIT: I found something weird with midnight legguards, the socket bonus(4hit) isnt activated unless you select "Weighted Total" for values. But shouldn't 4hit supposedly for offensive as well? Bug?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>They're on the list of things to be added.  The difficulty is that, as unique gems, they can't be included in the normal gem lists - it is unhelpful if the spreadsheet recommends socketing everything with a gem that you can only have one of.  As such, we would like to leave them as an option for socketing pieces of gear, but we need to adjust the gem model before such a thing is possible.<br>
<br>
Similarly, the epic gems from BT will need to be added at some point, but, again, we need to work on how to do so intelligently.</div>

<br>
Attack cycles are actually one of the most important parts of playing a rogue.  While they seem simple at first, getting one to actually run smoothly in an encounter is pretty tough and can require a lot of concentration and last second decisions.  <br>
<br>
Attack cycles look like: ax/by/cz  where x,y,z are finishing moves and a,b,c are numbers.  This is because the combo point building moves really don't change within a build.  With the exception of using shiv (typically a no-no in raids) you'll be using either sinister strike, backstab, or mutilate to build combo points.  What you do with them matters.<br>
<br>
Slice and dice is your biggest dps finishing move as it increases your white attack speed by 30% (and combo point generation if you're combat specced).  Common cycles will look like:<br>
3s/5s/5r.  What this says is you should be able to throw a 3 points slice and dice, then a 5 point slice and dice, followed by a 5 point rupture and still have time to get 3 combo points back for another 3 point slice and dice.  This cycle keeps slice and dice up at all times and uses rupture.  Because of the slow combo point generation of daggers, this is a common cycle for combat daggers.<br>
<br>
If you look at the opposite end of the combo point spectrum you'll see mutilate, which generates enough points for cycles like 4+s/4+r/4+x  which means you use 4 or more points (depending on seal of fate crits) for a slice and dice and then you should have enough time for 2 more finishers (both with 4+ points) before you need to renew slice and dice.<br>
<br>
With the 2-piece set bonus on rogue's tier 4 gear a wrench was thrown in the cycle gears, with 3 extra seconds on a slice and dice, new cycles were possible.  Right now you'll see cycles like 1s/5r for swords, saying that you should be able to generate 6 combo points within 1 talented slice and dice with 2 pieces of tier 4 (this is theoretically possible without the 2 piece bonus with good combat potency procs, but the bonus helps).<br>
<br>
I hope that wall of text cleared things up.</div>

</div>At the beginning of a fight definitly not, spamming Feint is neither powerful enough, nor does it help your dps. But a decent time into a fight you can Vanish to reset your Aggro and go "All Out". Usually that will be a big enough buffer for you to not reach the Tanks Aggro until either your Vanish is up again or the boss is dead. This holds true for DPS Values around 1200-1400 though. I yet have to find the optimal environment (Boss, party makeup, GEAR etc) though and consider the DPS of 2100 highly theoritcally.<br>

<br>
Right now there is only one list of gems; both gem selections and gem recommendations are drawn from that list.<br>
<br>
In order to handle unique gems, you would need to have two lists of gems: a list of which gems can be selected by the user while inputting their gear, and a list of which gems can be used by the spreadsheet while making socketing recommendations.<br>
<br>
This isn't necessarily a hugely hard change to make, but it will take some time, and we've been working on other things.  I think it's getting towards the top of the stack, though.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I'll admit, I don't totally understand all the math going on here.  I just started using the spreadsheet and read going back to read the initial posts.  With all the mention of how powerful +haste is/could be, how does <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080306045708/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=32665" target="_blank">http://www.wowhead.com/?item=32665</a> fit in compared to epic pre-BT/Hyjal gear?<br>
<br>
I've been trying to do some DPS comparisons vs. Drape of the Dark Reavers, trying to figure out how good static haste rating is (even on a blue item).  I decided to go all out and get +haste to gloves, giving me a 36 static haste rating w/o BT gear (which I believe is as high as it can get without DM Libram enchants).  <br>
<br>
Anyway, I haven't noticed any huge jump in DPS and was wondering if anyone else is doing testing.  I'm combat daggers so I hardly notice -.06 m-h swing speed and -.05 o-h.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</div>Using the older "Rogue DPS" spreadsheet, the Drape of the DR comes out ahead of everything by a good margin until you can kill Kael'Thas.  Since Aran has been stingy, I've been using the Cloak of the Craft (world drop BoE, 13 hit rating) for a long time.  The Crystalweave is a slight bit better than this, and the Vengeance Wrap with a Glinting Noble Topaz socketed is slightly better still.  The Drape still beats all of these hands-down in the cases I've done with both dagger and sword setups.</div>

</div>I think that this is mostly because the Drape of the DR is one of the few epic cloaks with +hit on it. If you're already reaching the hit cap via your other slots, the Drape's relative advantage over other cloaks is diminished or eliminated altogether. (Of course, having the Drape would allow you to reslot a few gem sockets to replace +hit with Agi or AP, but you know what I mean.)<br>
<br>
The Shade hasn't been kind in dropping the cloak for me in 15 or more kills so far, but I'm only one Romulo's Poison Vial away from reaching the hit cap without it so I may just have to buy the Blood Knight War Cloak or something if we stop running Kara before the Drape drops for me.</div>

As a second opinion is always nice I went to Foreshadows dps calulator (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080306045708/http://www.pvp.net.tf/" target="_blank">http://www.pvp.net.tf/</a>) and checked there.

</div>It's true.  Except that:<br>
<br>
1) Most raiding rogues have at least 200 hit rating.  Many have 300.  Either way, the difference in actual miss chance is perhaps another 6% - meaning the damage difference is 1% instead of .5%.  Not a large effect.<br>
<br>
2) The combat potency thing was never modeled in the first place, and is similarly a small effect anyway; it increases your combat potency procs by 5%, which works out to roughly 10 energy a minute, or about 6 dps.  Again, not a large effect.<br>
<br>
3) Even with Sword Spec proccing WSC, 75% or more of the procs are from Sinister Strikes.  Thus, the time between cooldown ending and the next proc occurring will increase about 30%... but since that time is significantly less than the cooldown, we find that the actual increase in uptime is minimal.  Moreover, WSC isn't a particularly good trinket in the first place.  So an already-mediocre trinket received an almost-trivial nerf.  Also not a huge concern.<br>
<br>
All in all?  Depending on your gear, the sword spec change might lower your damage output a bit - maybe 20 DPS.  Is this totally negligible?  Of course not.  But given that we're seeing differences of up to several hundred dps between swords and daggers, in no way does this "definitly bring the sword-combat dps down and in-line again with dagger-combat" as was asserted.  Swords are still a lot better.</div>

		<div id="post_message_393943">Out of personal curiosity I modified the v0.6.2 sheet for a 5s/4r daggercycle.<br>
I think I got it right but a couple of questions linger.<br>
<br>
First, what changes were made:<ul><li>changed 'free CP' to accomodate 3pt ruthlessnes</li>
<li>changed 'Enegry requirement'</li>
<li>changed SND uptime</li>
<li>changed BS/sec 1/2/3 and BS/Sec (at the bottom of the sheet)</li>
<li>changed Rupture dmg for 4pt rupture</li>
<li>changed the duration of rupture to 14 in "rupture uptime", "Total Ruptur DPS"</li>
</ul><br>
Now the questions:<ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li>"Cycle Energy" seems to lack  engergy required to use Bladeflurry and Adrenalin Rush</li>
<li>Netherblade 4pc modeled as 0.15% increase in Ruthlessness seems wrong to me.  Thottbot shows Netherblade 4pc as a 15% "Seal Fate" proc and Ruthlessness as a total different effect.</li>
<li>I do not fully understand the reason for the three blocks of calculations for the different procs. Is that to model "proc on proc" effekts of trinktes? If so why only three?</li>
<li>The cycle length calculated from "Energy required" and "Energy recoverd" is  longer than calculated in the DPS Sheet.</li>
</ol><br>
I hope someone can shed some light on this.<br>
<br>
Edit: <br>
The difference in DPS between 3s/5s/5r and 5s/4r is for the Gear-sheets is only 2-3DPS.<br>
Now the DPS-sheet predicts something about 11 DPS.  Somthing is amiss.<br>
And yes I modified the DPS sheet with the assumptions of the Gear sheet (Armor of 5000, Hit/skill dodge/skill etc.).</div>

</div>Aldriana, I'm curious to know about the mediocrity of the WSC. Im currently running Dragonspine + Romulo's. I have an extremely good chance at tsunami and WSC. <br>
<br>
The other spreadsheet, recently adjusted it's trinket values and WSC seems to have 10 DPS over tsunami raid buffed. Is this incorrect? Should I definitely go for Dragonspine + Tsunami? <br>
<br>
<br>
Also,<br>
<br>
With the new sword spec, my SCT is just spammed with 'extra attack' these days. I know a sword specialization proc can proc WF. But can a windfury attack proc sword specialization? I'm getting some really crazy chains (seen 5 extra attacks spam my screen at once), and I like it a lot.</div>

	</table>
</div>The Blade Flurry energy cost, I confess, is neglected - I'll add it in in a future revision.<br>
<br>
Adrenaline Rush costs no energy to activate; the energy gains from it's use are included in the Total Energy Recovery lines (which is why it's 10.5 + combat potency regen instead of 10+ combat potency regen).  Upon contemplation I've decided that's not the best way to model it, since AR doesn't help you keep cycles up; in some future revision I'll probably change AR to not affect what cycles you do, and instead model it as simply free additional backstabs/sinister strikes (or some such), since that's probably a more accurate model of the real situation.<br>
<br>
Netherblade is indeed a separate effect from Ruthlessness, but it doesn't matter for the model; whether it's independant or not, it still, on average, adds an extra .15 combo points.  Now, the probability distribution will be different (i.e. the chance to get get 2), but the average is still the same.<br>
<br>
As for the three blocks of calculations:  This is needed to model haste procs.  The fundamental difficulty of things like Dragonspine Trophy is that, because they increase your attack rate, they increase the number of procs you get - including Dragonspine Trophy itself.  Hence, you need some estimate of your haste uptime before you can compute your actual haste uptime.  This is what the 3 calculation blocks are for - they're using an iterative approach to get a good estimate of haste uptime that is used to compute the actual haste uptime at the end.  As for why 3?  Somewhat arbitrary, admittedly, but basically because that seemed to be enough to get a decent estimate of haste uptime.  I mean, consider the total haste values gotten after each iteration:<br>
<br>
Starting: 1.3600<br>
After First Iteration: 1.5397<br>
After Second Iteration: 1.5661<br>
After Third Iteration: 1.5700<br>
<br>
So, the first round of calculations got us into the right ballpark; the second round is closer still, and the third round is presumably even closer.  Note that the estimate changed by less than half a percent between the 2nd and 3rd; the 4th round would make even less difference than that.  Basically, 3 rounds seems to give a pretty good estimate, and while 4 or 5 or 20 would be more accurate still, I deemed this close enough and stopped for reasons of usability.<br>

</div>In terms of differences between this sheet and the other: half the reason I wrote this sheet is because I didn't feel the other was particularly accurate.

</div>Well, I can't speak in general, but, for instance, with my gear plugged into this sheet, I get the following scores for trinkets:<br>
<br>
Dragonspine: 453.8<br>
RPV: 155.8<br>
Tsunami: 152.2<br>
Abacus: 129.9<br>
Warp-Spring: 128.8<br>
<br>
Note that this is with the old sword spec.  Updating for the new sword spec drops WSC down to 124.8.<br>
<br>
So, from the perspective of this sheet, Dragonspine/Romulo's is the best current trinket setup.  The issue with RPV, of course, is that it's getting all it's benefit from hit; for instance, I have the trinket right now and can't use it, because I'm already at 308 hit.  The great advantage of Tsunami Talisman (and the reason I want it) is because it provides the same amount of benefit with much less +hit, meaning it's usable with a wider range of gear.<br>
<br>
As for why the other sheet gives different values:  well, first, see the note in my previous post about differences between that sheet and this.  With regards to the specific case of WSC: I'm not up on how the other sheet models it, so I can't comment in detail, but I think at least part of it is the fact that the other sheet has a much lower base armor value for mobs, which inflates the value of armor penetration effects.</div>

</div>If the other sheet has a higher value for base armor, shouldn't that only effect the  overall DPS, and not the effect of armor penetration exclusively? For example, debuffing 500 armor off a mob with 10k armor should yield the same DPS increase as a 500 armor penetration on a mob with 5k armor? I'm not sure how this is modeled in either sheet, but that seems like the ovelry-simplified logical conclusion to me. Or does penetration/armor scale in an odd fashion?</div>

</div>Penetrating 500 armor out of 5k is a larger percentage damage increase than penetrating 500 out of 10k.<br>
<br>
Formula for armor mitigation is 10557.5/(10557.5+x).<br>
<br>
So, an opponent that has 10k armor takes 51.36% damage, while one with 9500 takes 52.64% damage - an increase of 2.49%<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, an opponent that has 5k armor takes 67.86% damage, while one with 4500 takes 70.11% damage - an increase of 3.32%.<br>
<br>
Regarding WSC is particular: I looked it over a bit and though of a better way to model it; I don't expect it to make a huge difference, but the current sheet is undervaluing WSC just slightly.  It's actual value is probably about 5 AP higher than listed; I'll put the new model in the next release.</div>

</div>Thanks for the detailed explanation.<br>
<br>
I went a step further and added a couple of dropdownboxes where you can add SND cp usage and at the moment rupture CP. Probably I will add an eviscarate as well.<br>
So you can, in a fashion, select your personal cycle and compare it with other cylces.<br>
Not as fancy as the DPS sheet but still helpful IMO for deciding what gear to use.<br>
<br>
So if you'r interested I can sent my sheet to you for inclusion in the official version.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Hey Aldriana, I was wondering if you had any ideas about implementing the Rod of the Sun King in a future revision. I'm wondering if the energy proc could make up for the lack of sword spec, as I picked it up for fun this week. <br>

</div>So, the first concern is that, according to some procwatch parses in the Rogue DPS spreadsheet thread, the proc rate is nowhere near 6 PPM.  From his numbers, it looks closer to 2, maybe 3.  If the proc rate is as low as that, Rod of the Sun King is basically doomed.  So it would probably be worth trying to get some confirmation on that, one way or the other.<br>
<br>
Secondly, this opens the whole can of worms of maces/fists, which, as mentioned a few pages back, are a royal pain in the you-know-where to model.  So I don't have any immediate plans to add it to the sheet - at least, not until I come up with something brilliant in terms of adding other weapon types to the sheet.<br>
<br>
That said: it is possible to get some quick-hack estimates of the dps such a thing would provide.  If you're looking at going mace spec only - that is, getting an OH mace speccing 19/42 or 20/41 - this can be approximated by just turning off sword spec.  Swords without sword spec are basically maces, for most purposes of damage calculation.  So to get a damage estimate of Rod of the Sun King, what you'd want to do is:<br>
<br>
1) Set Sword Spec to 0<br>
2) Replace one of the MH swords with the stats of Rod of the Sun King (damage range, speed, and the AP)<br>
3) Go into the sword calc sheet and modify rows 56, 88, 120, and 156 to reflect the higher energy regeneration; if you just want to model it as 2 energy per second, just change the 10.5 to a 12.5.<br>
<br>
This should spit out a reasonable damage estimate number; you can then compare this to the damage estimate for the actual swords (by using the unmodified sheet) and get some idea as to what is going to be better.<br>
<br>
Now, the more interesting case is using Rod of the Sun King with a sword OH, and speccing 16/45 to get sword spec (or 18/43 to get sword spec but not weapon expertise, or 19/42 or 20/41 to get sword spec and WEx but not mace spec, or... well, you get the idea).  I would expect one of these to be optimal, but this is *much* harder to calculate (going back to the "not putting maces/fists in the spreadsheet" thing).  If people are actually interested in this, I can hack out some numbers to get some dps values, but you'd sort of have to take my word for the results as I'd need to do a major chop job on the sheet to get anything productive out of it.</div>

<br>
For now, going from combat daggers to grabbing this thing I'm sitting with a Shiv OH and actually went with full dagger and mace spec. Thinking was that mace spec was for the weapon skill, and then I only had to cut out 2 points in imp poisons for the full dagger spec for the OH. In my mind 2% crit on the OH was much better than another 4% poison proc rate since I always have a shammy in my group and deadly stays up all the time.<br>
<br>
I figured that this would work out well for the extra .1 speed off the OH till we get a touch further in BT and then I could take the points out of daggers and put them in swords when a blade of savagery drops.<br>
<br>
Of course this is all deciding on whether or not this energy can make up for the lack of sword spec as it is!</div>

<br>
Gear setup:<br>
<br>
Only using Rod in the MH, no OH, however there was mongoose on the Rod.<br>
No Dragonspine, No Tsunami (I know I probably didn't need to take that off)<br>
No Thundering Skyfire Diamond on.<br>
<br>
Data:<br>

Procs/Min:  1<br>
<br>
This was straight beating on a blasted lands mob, had a wonderful time on my 40 priest tossing a heal every few minutes. As stated, there were no haste procing items except the Mongoose enchant, so that could slightly skew the results.<br>
<br>
It appears as if the Rod is no where near what I had expected from it. A little over 4,7% proc chance brings it to be less common than mace spec!<br>
<br>
Excluding Combat Potency procs, it looks as if this will add approximately 1,36 procs from white damage and 0,705 procs from SS. Bringing a grand total of around 0,33 extra energy per second. <br>
<br>
That's a VERY rough estimate of course, it's late and I'm tired, but from that alone it seems as if this is definitely not going to be better than Talon, or FoV.<br>
<br>
Of course from this it is definitely not worth your time to work maces into the sheet it seems. I'm going to play around with the energy regen parts of the sheet in the morning to see what the spreadsheet dps gain is with these stats, and I'll get back to you all.<br>
<br>
EDIT: Oh I forgot to add, rough estimate of proc dps: About 15 with what I have worked out so far.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Well, I can't speak in general, but, for instance, with my gear plugged into this sheet, I get the following scores for trinkets:<br>
<br>
Dragonspine: 453.8<br>

Tsunami: 152.2<br>
Abacus: 129.9<br>

	</table>
</div>I've noticed theres a big problem with the individual dps listings of items that proc haste effects. i.e. Dragonspine and Thundering Skyfire diamond. I get roughly the same dps listing as you for trinkets, but in reality Dragonspine is actually nowhere near 450dps. Try this: put on the hourglass instead of the dragonspine. The hourglass should be ~100dps depending on the rest of your gear. Then switch to the Dragonspine. In your 'Rough DPS' field at the top, going from hourglass-&gt;dragonspine only gives you about 80dps, but for the individual trinkets, it claims Dragonspine is about 300dps better than hourglass. The same thing happens with a thundering skyfire vs relentless earthstorm diamond comparison. According to the values next to the diamonds, it looks like the thundering is 21 dps better than relenteless, but when you actually do the diamond swap in your gear, my overall dps only increases by 8 or so. <br>
<br>
I haven't spent enough time delving into the spreadsheet to be able to explain this yet, but I *can* say that this over-valuing of haste procs in the dps field next to them appears to only happen with haste procs. I don't see how dragonspine could be more beneficial to me than Netherblade chest or legs, but when I take the value of hourglass, and add the delta I get in overall dps when switching to dragonspine, i get ~180dps which seems more accurate. <br>
<br>
Is there an easy explanation for why its this way? Or is it just some oversight that can be fixed?</div>

</div>The number next to the item is the equivalent AP, not a DPS estimate.  In other words, if instead of a haste effect, the dragonspine was just "Equip: xxx AP", based on the benefit the trinket is giving you, that xxx would be 450.<br>

</div>Yeah, that's a known issue. Zone filters currently work by setting the value of the item in question to zero such that it gets moved to the bottom of the upgrade list; the unfortunate part of this is that it means everything shows up as a huge upgrade over it if you have it equipped. It's something that's on our list to be fixed, we just haven't gotten to it yet.<br>
<br>
Basically, I've been fairly busy lately so haven't had a lot of time to continue development on this sheet.  I'll try to push something out this weekend with at least the major fixes (Arena 2 gear, Sword Spec changes, and assorted bug fixes) but it'll probably be a few weeks before there's significant feature upgrades (unless Darlal has more free time than I do, anyway).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Not much in the way of changes; updated Sword spec for the new patch, added the Arena 2 gear, and put in a few other raid drops that were missing - that's about it.

Are you sure it's not activating?  Only way to check that is to manually add up the stats yourself; the "Socket Bonus?" column is addressing whether you *should* go for the socket bonus, not whether you *are* going for the socket bonus.  So on Netherblade Helm and Edgewalker Longboots, it feels that the the socket bonus is worth getting, but on BBV it think you will be better off just ignoring the socket bonus.

</div>Yeah, haste to head and leg don't really compete with the existing enchants.<br>
<br>
However, thinking about it, at very high gear + buff levels, haste to gloves *does* catch up with 15 agi in terms of sheer damage output.  Now, of course, I think it'll be a few months yet before anyone is that geared, and it's pretty rare to be that buffed... but as it is possible, I should probably throw haste to gloves into the sheet.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Are you sure it's not activating?  Only way to check that is to manually add up the stats yourself; the "Socket Bonus?" column is addressing whether you *should* go for the socket bonus, not whether you *are* going for the socket bonus.  So on Netherblade Helm and Edgewalker Longboots, it feels that the the socket bonus is worth getting, but on BBV it think you will be better off just ignoring the socket bonus.  This doesn't take into consideration the fact that the blue gem is probably helping activate a metagem, though.</div>

</div>Ahh, I thought it was teling me it was not active, not telling me I shouldn't use it.  That makes sense now.

In terms of larger modeling fixes - such as improved dagger cycles - I'm working on some ideas but have no realistic estimate when I'll have time to iron out the details and get them working.<br>

In terms of UI fixes: again, there's stuff I'd like to see put in (such as socket colors and unique gems) but I'm woefully unqualified to implement them myself, and, last I heard, Darlal is pretty busy as well.<br>

Also on trash mobs etc, if you have like 3-4 cp and it is about to die is it more advisable to evis or to try and get another backstab etc in the mix?<br>

On trash i rarely use any other finishers unless it's the last target to kill and I have 4-5 CP on it.  SnD is just so much better than the other finishers that you're better off keeping it up and "wasting" a few seconds between mobs than blowing an untalented direct damage finisher and starting over without SnD up on the next mob.<br>

For bosses, I still open with backstab-&gt;SnD.  I prioritize keeping SnD up, and if I have 5 CP and ~10 or more secs left on SnD, I'll rupture.

				<div style="font-style:italic">Yeah, haste to head and leg don't really compete with the existing enchants.<br>
<br>
However, thinking about it, at very high gear + buff levels, haste to gloves *does* catch up with 15 agi in terms of sheer damage output.  Now, of course, I think it'll be a few months yet before anyone is that geared, and it's pretty rare to be that buffed... but as it is possible, I should probably throw haste to gloves into the sheet.</div>

		<div id="post_message_417359"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I know that including fists and maces is a low priority atm and personally I agree with this, no reason to spend time researching cleary inferior specs (unless they buff the rod). There is perhaps one notable exception however, using mh fist and oh sword. With both weapon specs the only dps talents you're giving up is maybe a couple points in vile poisons. I don't expect this combo to beat sword+sword but it would be interesting to see how close it is, the slightly higher yellow damage has some merit in certain fights. I know there's not a huge amount of fists available, al'ars and the bladefist are pretty rare, but BBWP and ofc S2 mh are quite common.<br>
<br>
This is entirely self-serving ofc since I just got al'ars mh fist (morogrim is being very stingy) but would it be possible to add these few mh fists to the sheet and assume fist spec when they're equipped, or would it be a lot of work?<br>
<br>
I've also heard that the bladefist procs quite a lot, has anyone done any testing on this? Did a quick search on these forums but didn't find anything.<br>
<br>
On a different note, one small addition I would like to see in the sheet is some kind of total defensive value of your gear for comparisons. Something like the rough dps estimate so that you can track both offense and defense when changing several items and gems. I find that I'm often not comparing one piece of gear with another directly but rather one set of gear/bonuses/gems with another set. If one piece is changed several others may need to be changed as well due to set bonuses and the hit cap. Having the rough dps visible makes these comparisons a lot easier but the defensive changes have to be added by hand currently. Also a way to easily change the defensive weighting would be nice but that's been mentioned before.<br>
<br>
Anyway thanks for all the work you guys are putting into this excellent sheet.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Daemona's already alluded to it - but it's kind of a funny case.<br>
<br>
As the high end of gear stands at the moment there are lots of haste options out there (mongoose/trinkets/slayer's bonus etc.) So you end up getting more worth from 15agility as a dmg component that scales with the rest of your haste.<br>
<br>
I played around on the spreadsheets and even when I removed all haste bonuses I couldn't get 10 haste above 15agility.  The crit component scales with gear too, apparently at the same rate as 10haste.

I'd assume that you mean, haste rating is additive with those other factors, in-turn, it is not as valuble. Is that what you were eluding to?<br>

		<div id="post_message_420480"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Well, I'm back from vacation, so development can now resume.  As brief comments to the posts in the last week:<br>
<br>
Re: Modeling haste enchants.  Well, the incremental value of haste is computed on the sword/dagger calc sheets, so a direct comparison is possible.  Increasing white damage by .95%, on the other hand, does not give accurate values.  Regardless, when I actually punched everything in, I found that end BT gear + full raid buffs + consumables would put haste to gloves just barely ahead of agi, but anything less than that came up short.<br>
<br>
Re: Adding other weapon options.  I actually have good news on this front.  While on vacation I was thinking about the spreadsheet some (specifically, the question of how to do adjustable dagger cycles) and, while so doing, I came up with an approach that, in addition to getting adjustable dagger cycles, *should* also make it practical to add maces and fists as options.  So I'm hopeful that I will be able to add those in the next major revision.  As doing so involves a complete overhaul of the calculation pages, it will probably take me a couple weeks - I'm aiming for the end of July, but don't hold me to that.<br>
<br>
Re: Haste stacking.  SnD, BF, and Mongoose are all percentage based, and applied independantly.  I believe Heroism is as well, but I haven't checked, honestly.  All haste rating items add together and are then applied.<br>
<br>
So, for instance, if you have SnD, BF, 2xMongoose, and DST all up at the same time, the actual attack speed increase is 1.3x1.2x1.02x1.02x1.3091.<br>
<br>
A 1% speed increase thus does not equate directly to a 1% increase in white damage, both for reasons of the mechanics of stacking, as well the effects on procs.<br>
<br>
Edit: Oh, and Re: racial abilities.  Good call.  I'll get the human racial in the next revision - other abilities (berserking, etc.) will have to wait, but that ones simple to add so I will toss it in.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>The way the calc sheets currently work is that column B of each contains a computation of how much damage you do with the gear you have selected, and then columns C through whatever repeat that calculation with 1 more strength, 1 more agi, and so on.  So the "next stat" values are the last row in the calc sheets at the moment.<br>
<br>
However, this will be changing in 0.7; I'm going to be replacing the Sword and Dagger calc pages with a set of 7 new sheets, which will have the following effects:<br>
<br>
a) adjustable dagger cycles<br>
b) allow additional weapon types<br>
c) ease the restrictions on talent selection<br>
d) create a much more readable location for the next-stat info.<br>
<br>
At the moment I'm still catching up on things after my vacation, so I haven't done a whole lot of work on these changes yet, but I hope to have more time to work on them next week.<br>

As for adding gems: my understanding is that it's a bit painful, although honestly Darlal did most of the work on that part of the sheet so I don't know for sure.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Now I'm struggling to find out what to think of armour reduction in a raid situation. Your sheet gives me a rough DPS value of 1500 while in the real world I average about 1300. I suppose the difference can be accounted to the amount of armour that is assumed in the sheet. I'd love to fiddle around with this value, but I failed at Excel and wasn't able to find the relevant cells.<br>

So if any of you are feeling bored and would like to help out, it would be nice if people could take some data sets on the proc rates of various items, most notably Dragonspine Trophy, although the Blacksmithing maces, The Bladefist, and other weapons with haste procs would be helpful as well.<br>

Thanks for all the work on this.

I also have a couple of questions.  <br>
<br>
First, I'm human and using swords but when I switch back and forth between human and NE the current hit value doesn't change.  Does the spreadsheet take into account the human racial bonus to sword skill?  <br>
<br>
Second, how is optimal hit calculated?  In particular it's saying that my current hit is 235 and my optimal is 251.  To the best of my knowledge neither 235 nor 215 is hit capped even with the human racial and using swords with Latro's as an offhand. So shouldn't my optimal hit be whatever the cap is-294?</div>

		<div id="post_message_442791">It's sort of a combination of things that are holding up the show at this point.<br>
<br>
1) Mechanics testing.  For the most part, this is in decent shape; I was waiting on this for a while, but at this point I'm mostly at the point where I'm either going to take my best guess or leave out the offending piece of gear for the moment... and mostly the former, probably, given that testing so far has led me to the following rule of thumb:<br>
<br>
<i>All weapon procs are probably 1PPM in absence of significant evidence to the contrary</i><br>
<br>
So, for things that haven't been tested yet (Siphon of the Nathrezim and Blacksmithing Hammers, for instance) I'll probably just fill in 1 PPM for now and will change it later if necessary.<br>
<br>
The only outstanding thing here that I'm at all concerned about is the T5 4/5 proc rate.  This turns out to be sort of a difficult effect to model, and I really have no good data on what the answer might be.  The limited testing I've seen so far makes it appear that the answer is most likely not 1 PPM, so I don't have a good feeling on what to plug in as an estimate.  Still, this by itself wouldn't be holding me up - I'd just take my best guess and move on.<br>
<br>
2) The new calc sheets are a slightly larger job that I originally estimated - there are a few subtleties to implementing them that I didn't initially appreciate, and the planned number of sheets has increased from 7 to 11 (of which 5 are mostly complete, all of which are significantly larger than either calculation sheet in 0.6.3).  So they're taking a bit more time than I originally expected.<br>
<br>
3) The other thing holding up the show at the moment is a sort of communications mixup between Darlal and myself.  In order to support the underlying mechanic changes, there are some UI improvements that need to be made; additionally, there are some general UI improvements that would nice to have made at some point (for instance, the unique gem issue).  He and I discussed these about 2 weeks ago, and he indicated that he thought he might have time to make at least some of them... and I haven't heard from him since.  I guess he got busy with work or whatever.  Now, normally, this wouldn't be a problem; I'd just take a day or two, figure out how to do the UI stuff myself, and plow forwards.  What I'm concerned about, though, is the possibility that he might have started work on some of the more sophisticated changes; if I make the basic changes and then pound out 0.7 based on that + the new calculation sheets, and then he shows up with a version with all sorts of neat UI fixes... we have sort of a problem in terms of merging two fairly sophisticated sets of changes back into one sheet.  So I sort of hate to move forwards until I know what his status is.<br>
<br>
Anyway: I haven't forgotten about this sheet, and I am still working on it, but I don't really have a good time estimate as to when everything will be done.</div>

		<div id="post_message_443081">WWS parses will perhaps helps some, but the fact that you're using two weapons of different speeds makes it hard to draw conclusions.  It's useful for generating ballpark figures but you can't really do statistics to know how good your answer is.<br>
<br>
In general, the most useful data collection for testing proc rates is a reasonably long (1k+ attacks, and more is better) period of attacks performed either with a single weapon or with two weapons of the same speed.  Using combo point generating moves is fine, but avoid finishing moves (as I have a sneaking suspicion that finishers might obey slightly unusual proc rules).<br>
<br>
When testing proc buffs (such as Coup De Grace) it is advantageous to use a buff-canceling macro like the one listed in the mechanics testing thread.  This isn't essential, but it's defenitely helpful.<br>
<br>
I generally like to see a combatlog of such data, but if you use a buff-canceling macro the following are sufficient:<br>
<br>
1) How many attacks, including specials, did you land on the target?<br>
2) How many procs occurred?<br>
3) What is the shortest period of time between consecutive procs?<br>
<br>
If you don't use a canceling macro, a combatlog is sort of necessary to analyze for overlapping procs.<br>
<br>
To accurately pin down the proc rate of an effect requires two such data sets performed with different weapon speeds, and the more different the better; for instance, take a data set with a 1.3 speed weapon, and then another with a 2.6 speed weapon.</div>

I would suggest trying to manually trying to cancel the buff at first to see if it can be done before you go cursing the macro for not working <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20071226104253im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":)" class="inlineimg">.<br>

I haven't had a chance to make all the other changes I'd like to make, but never fear - I do plan to work on them over the next week or two.  However, before I took the time to implement all the suggestions, ideas, and other features people have had, I wanted to make the new calculation sheet available, so as to allow you fine folks to start playing with it and finding any mistakes I might have made (as, while I tried to be careful, it is highly probably that I missed something at some point).<br>
<br>
So, anyway: version 0.7 is now available at the links below, but be aware that it's perhaps a bit buggy in spots.  If you find anything that doesn't make sense/doesn't match your expectations from the prior version/whatever, let me know.<br>

* Defensive contribution of Mongoose is totally neglected.<br>
* Sheet does not include the latest weapon-skill findings; hence, if you operate with less than 5 weapon skill, your damage values will be incorrect.<br>

Stuff planned to be added soon:<br>
* Maces and fist weapons.<br>
* User-edittable interface for offense/defense weighting, mob armor, mob resist rate, and similar parameters.<br>
* More descriptive gem names<br>
* Possibly BT and Unique gems, assuming I can find a way to implement them.<br>
* Any other comments in the last 5 pages or so - I'll look through them at some point and add what I feel is worth adding.</div>

Again: I do plan to add them; the hold up is that historically I've done more of the calc stuff and not so much of the UI changes, so the UI stuff tends to develop somewhat more slowly.</div>

		<div id="post_message_447978">Just downloaded the sheet and I want to say a big thankyou for making and keeping this sheet current Aldriana (-:<br>
<br>
I found an error with Romulo's Poison Vial (at least in my version) where the calculation for estimating proc value for each hand is not implemented, and each hand procs 277 times per minute.  Going from the old sheet (and of course common sense), to fix it you just need to multiply the '277' value by the main hand and offhand strikes per minute (respectively) and I have done that for my own sheet.</div>

		<div id="post_message_447988">That's actually an intentional change and not a bug.  I introduced a new way of computing the damage done by PPM procs which will be more accurate than the old way.  What's encoded on Trinket sheet is that it procs for 277 damage per minute (i.e. 1 PPM at 277 damage per proc).  It then evaluates the value based on the columns Q and R of the DamageCalcs page, which compute the incremental value of a 1 damage per minute proc.  So while the computation is done a bit differently than in prior versions, the overall value of the trinket should be about the same in 0.6.3 and 0.7 - which is true, at least, in my working copy of the sheet.<br>
<br>
<b>Edit:<br>
<br>
My apologies, there is actually a bug there - I failed to totally switch things over to the new calculation method.  I'll post a fix in a few minutes.</b><br>
<br>
Before anyone brings them up, the following are also not bugs:<br>
<br>
1) Dragonspine Trophy scores even higher than it did before.  It does so since I updated the proc rate to match the newest data on it's proc rate.<br>
<br>
2) Windfury is a smaller damage boost than it was before.  Again, intentional.  Done to match the hotfix to Windfury.<br>
<br>
3) Daggers do somewhat more damage than previously.  Again, intentional.  It's much smarter about computing dagger cycles than it used to be.</div>

I'm not wholly caught up on them myself, but the short version is: You really, really, *really* want to have at least 355 weapon skill as a melee class.

It appears that with 350 weapon skill, you have a 28% miss chance dual-wielding and a 9% miss chance single weapon (mitigated by your to-hit rating, precision, etc)<br>

</div>Each of the calc sheets named after a cycle computes the damage for the named cycle.  It does so by computing the "best" cycle of that form.  Best is somewhat of a loose term, though, in that there will be situations where, for instance, the Xs5r cycle does not compute the highest-damage cycle of that form.  However, the set of 6 sheets working in concert *should* between them work out what the best possible cycle is for a given gear setup (more on this later).  This where the DamageCalcs page comes in; for each combination of stats, it computes the maximum possible damage across all 6 pages, and uses this to value the stats.<br>
<br>
To see what value of X is actually being used, consult line 300 of 5sXr and 1sXr, line 293 of Xs5r and Xs3r, or line 310 of 5sXr3s.<br>
<br>
So, for instance, with my current gear filled in, the value of 5sXr.B300 is 5, which means that that sheet is computing my damage for the cycle 5s5r.  1sXr.B300, however, is 3.73, which means that it's computing damage for the cycle 1s3.73r.<br>
<br>
Now, obviously, there's no such thing is a 3.73 point rupture; in reality, you'd have to use either 3 or 4 point ruptures.  However, quantizing cycles to whole numbers would cause discontinuities in the value of stats, which strikes me as bad on the whole; the purpose of the sheet is not to be a 100% accurate damage calculator (although, I like to think it's pretty good).  The purpose of the sheet is to get good values for all the stats, and using continuous values for the cycles helps quite a bit with that.<br>
<br>
Anyway: 5sXr, 1sXr, and 5sXr3s all attempt to find the largest rupture you can work into the cycle while maintaining 100% SnD uptime.  This should always be the highest damage cycle available.  Note that all ruptures are forced to be at least 3-point ruptures, as the damage dropoff from 3 to 2 is considerable so it's unlikely that a smaller rupture will ever make sense.<br>
<br>
Xs5r and Xs3r, on the other hand, compute the smallest possible SnD that will allow the cycle to be sustained.  This is *usually* the highest-damage cycle of that form, but it is possible to come up with situations where it's not.  However, it can be shown that in situations where it's *not* optimal, a 5 point SnD is. So, for instance, Xs5r.B293 for my current gear is 3.14.  So it's probably the case that 3.14s5r is my best cycle.  However, it's also possible that 5s5r might be better.  Fortunately, as noted above, 5sXr is computing *that* possibility, so in general one or the other of those should give the best possible cycle of the form Xs5r.<br>
<br>
Long story short: for a given level of energy regen there are 3 cycles of the form XsYr that might be optimal.  Between the 4 sheets of that form, all 3 possibilities are covered, so between them the optimal cycle should always be computed.  5sXr3s and 5s are tacked on for those cases where energy regen is insufficient to sustain even 5s3r.  So, in general, these combinations should always give your best dps option.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I know your working hard on a lot of things for this spreadsheet, is there any plans to include fists in a later release? I like this sheet better then the dps spreadsheet, as values seem more realistic. The only thing it seems to be missing is being able to look at specs such as combat fists, and the fist MH sword OH combo. Although i think i already know the answer to which spec is best, its a good source to be able to show other rogues in my guild.</div>

Regarding trinkets: in my copy of the sheet I show WSC ranked appropriately - with my gear (i.e., what the sheet is first downloaded with) I show WSC at 165, a bit ahead of Tsunami (154) and well ahead of DFT (112).  If you could send me your gear/spec (or email me a copy of the sheet with your stuff filled in) that would help me with diagnosing it.<br>

Speaking of bugs: I just realized I made a mistake with adding the new maces/fists; while the scoring for all of them is correct, the actual DPS number reported with Syphon, Rod of the Sun King, Dragonstrike, Dragonmaw, or The Bladefist equipped will be incorrect.

		<div id="post_message_450714">On the regular rogue forums it appears to be blasphemy to suggest that fist spec with a dagger OH could rival pure sword spec using dual swords for pve DPS. However, it does appear to me from the spreadsheet that fist/dagger and an identical talent spec (20/41 with 4 points in Imp Poisons) OTHER than in relation to weapon specialisation results in fist/dagger coming out at pretty much exactly the same DPS as sword/sword (sometimes a little more - sometimes a little less depending on gear). <br>
<br>
I think what happens is that as one's gear gets towards the top end and if you factor in raid buffs swords come out more favourably - but towards the middle to lower end fists are better. It seems to me that gear placing you at around the 750 DPS unbuffed mark with 308+hit (that is with boss mob armour on) yeilds more from fist/dagger but as you go above that swords move incrementally ahead (raid buffed on 750 base results in about 1170 with the most common buffs and swords are a mere 5.5 DPS ahead then).<br>
<br>
Can this be right? Does the spreadsheet factor in the benefits of sword spec fully? It has been pointed out (somewhat bluntly) to me that swords are just plain better full stop but as far as i can see (a) they are not better in the low - mid range of gear - they are worse (b) they are only very fractionally better using insanely good gear. Keeping in mind fists give +crit for better pvp viability and burst i've concluded that fist/dagger is pretty nice. <br>
<br>
Finally - a lot of people mention dual specialisation fist/sword but it has become apparent to me that you are better off avoiding double specialisation and putting the extra points into poisons.........but the point of this post really is to ask if the spreadsheet factors in the benefits of sword spec in a way that people recognise to truly reflect the benefits of that spec.</div>

		</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</div>There are a couple reasons I decided to make this sheet.  <br>
<br>
First, I've never been particularly impressed with the accuracy of the other sheet.  Dating back to when I first hit level 60 I preferred to use my own calculations than rely on other people's, and the other sheet was no exception.  This became even more true when the expansion came out and some of the effects just plain couldn't be modeled accurately by the other sheet.  So, one of the ways this sheet is differentiated is that it is (in my opinion, at least) vastly more accurate.  <br>
<br>
Second, at the time I started work on this sheet, the Rogue DPS sheet had basically no provision for comparing gear whatsoever.  All it had was a little next-stat block buried in one of the middle sheets, which was even less accurate than the rest of the sheet was.  It is my understanding that they have since improved this somewhat, but most of those features arose after the creation of this sheet.  And, it might be noted, the solutions applied for those fixes only work in Excel; for people who use OpenOffice (such as myself on my home computer) the other sheet is totally worthless.<br>
<br>
In general, my main characterization of the other sheet is that it has gotten bogged down with a lot of unnecessary features and gismos and doodads, which interfere with it's core usability.  Fundamentally, it's still a DPS sheet with gear comparisons tacked on, and it shows. This aspires to be a really elegant sheet for gear comparisons, that happens to include a pretty decent damage calculator.  So if you're attempting to decide between a couple of different specs, you may find the other sheet to be more usable (although not necessarily more accurate); however, if you've already decided on roughly what spec you're interested in (which is fairly straightforward, given than there's only about 4 fundamentally different specs worth using as a raiding rogue) and are trying to figure out what gear upgrades to focus on and in what order - this sheet is miles ahead of the other, in my opinion.<br>

</div>It's on my to-do list for this sheet (along with half a dozen other things).  Fortunately, it seems to be one of the easier changes to make - it's the unique gems that are going to be harder.  I'll probably try to push out a version with the epic gems and other easy fixes sometime this weekend.<br>

</div>Not easily, alas.  I mean, the fundamental problem is as follows.  You have a set of gear, which has a dozen gem sockets in it.   2 of these gem sockets need to be changed to blue gems to activate the metagem.  How do you know which 2 to change?  It's a reasonably easy thing to figure out as a human (the two that activate the most powerful set bonuses, basically).  But it's sort of hard to define in a general way in a spreadsheet.</div>

</div>The first thing I'd note is that for a rogue to only do 750 DPS, your gear needs to be fairly weak; using only quest rewards, BoEs, and 5man drops (not heroics - regular 5 mans) you can put together gear that will do that much unbuffed.  So for the average raiding rogue - which is who this sheet is targetted at - 750 DPS is very much low-end.<br>
<br>
Secondly, I don't think "unbuffed" is necessarily the fairest comparison.  Again, a typical raiding rogue is going to be using at least *some* buffs.<br>
<br>
So, with that in mind: yes, it's true that at low levels of gear, unbuffed, swords do not possess a particularly large advantage over the other available options.  However, I think it is fair to say that as gear increases, swords pull further and further ahead.  For instance, in my current armor with Arena 2 weapons, my buffed DPS with swords is about 1470.  Switching over to Arena 2 fist + dagger, it drops to 1430.<br>
<br>
Now, 40 DPS isn't a *huge* deal, but it is enough to say that swords are pretty clearly better from a PvE DPS perspective.  And, frankly, I would dispute the claim that they're inferior for PvP - the burst damage potential of Sword Spec is not to be underestimated.<br>
<br>
As to the underlying question regarding whether Sword Spec is modeled correctly: I was pretty careful to include everything, so as far as I know it should be correct.  This is not to say that there might not be a mistake somewhere - but I'd need something a little more specifically amiss than "swords don't beat fists by as much as I expected" in order to track it down.</div>

		<div id="post_message_451146">In reference to the above post re: fists vs. swords, it should be noted that the other dps spreadsheet corroborates the result.  That is, swords beat fists, but not by much (the numbers I've seen hover around 1%), and much of that difference is attributable to the fact that available OH swords are better than the available OH fists (specifically, the S2 OH fist sucks).  As well, the other sheet corroborates the fact that combo fist + sword spec does not ofset the points that could have been spent in poisons unless you run with windfury (in which case, it's about a draw).<br>
<br>
As for the pvp vs. pve comparison, the slight edge would go to swords as well, not only because of the slight dps increase, but because that additional 5% you are critting with fists is mitigated by resilience, whereas the 5% extra attacks are not (or are not as much).<br>
<br>
Still, I went with fists for playstyle reasons.  As a sneakerpimp it's essential that my primary attack be a slap.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20071227031755im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/wink.gif" border="0" alt="" title=";)" class="inlineimg"></div>

I realize there are likely many small differences between the estimates dps outputs, and that trying to reconcile all of them would be futile...but since the choice of where to put those poison talents is one many raiding rogues face (and least those of us who cannot count on windfury) it would be nice to know which numbers to trust.<br>

<br>
First question would be "are you using the same poisons in both cases".  What you should observe is that with Deadly Poison, Vile Poisons is better, whereas with Instant Poison, Improved Poisons is better.  If you're using both IP and DP (i.e., one on each hand), my recollection is that Vile Poisons is still better - I know I made a post about it a month or two ago, but I don't remember in which thread - try searching around a bit to see if you can turn it up.<br>
<br>
So, if you do have the same poisons selected in both cases, I'd characterize the answer as follows:<br>
<br>
If you're using Deadly, this sheet is probably right, and the other is wrong.<br>
If you're using Instant, this sheet is probably wrong, and the other is right.<br>
If you're using both and the answers are close, it's conceivable that both sheets handle it correctly and one is just more accurate.  My guess would be this one, but I'm probably biased.<br>
If you're using both and the answers are pretty different, it's presumably a bug in one or both sheets, and would require more investigation.</div>

I have another question that's been bothering me for quite some time, the spreadsheet seems to treat +hit in a linear fashion, 200 + 10 hit is evaluated the same as 308 + 10 hit (which is somewhat of a waste) is this the case so even if I ruin my hit rating I should still get +haste instead?</div>

		<div id="post_message_452023">Strength is a dps stat, but agility gives more dps, so should you completely trash your strength in order to get a better stat? Yes.  <br>
<br>
The interaction of haste and hit is definitely more complex than this, but in general, haste is a more powerful stat, so yes, you will drop below the hit cap if you go for absolutely optimal gear.<br>
<br>
Also, as Ald posted above, it's far FAR easier for a human to make the decision of "Where should I put my 2 blue gems" than it is for the spreadsheet.  The spreadsheet recommends whether or not the set bonus on a particular item is worth going after or not - usually you'll have a few items where it's not, put your blue gems in there, or in a set piece with blue slots that the bonus IS worth going after.  <br>

</div>Right - the recommendations don't factor in metagem activation, so it (possibly mistakenly) recommends using hit gems (or whatever) for socketing Belt of Deep Shadow - this is what the "Socket Bonus?" column means.<br>
<br>
Regardless of what this column says, however, if you have two blue gems in it, the socket bonus is being factored in to computations.  Just because it doesn't think you should be using it doesn't mean it doesn't use it if you have matching gems in.<br>
<br>
<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px; ">

		</td>

	</table>
</div>It's true that the spreadsheet does not account for the hit cap; the reason for this is more or less the same reason it doesn't account for metagem activation.  It's performing a piece-by-piece optimization of your gear, rather than trying to set up all your gear for you at once.  Therefore, while it's capable of recognizing whether or not metagems are activated or that you're over the hit cap, it doesn't really have any good way of knowing where to drop hit or which gems to swap out to solve this problem.<br>
<br>
What this means is, basically: this is a tool.  It provides some useful information.  There are a few things that you still need to figure out for yourself, though.  Fortunately, in the case of metagems, this is pretty easy - you want to put the blue gems where they're going to activate the most (and most powerful) set bonuses.<br>
<br>
For instance, consider the optimal endgame gear, which includes the following socketed items:<br>
<br>
Cursed Vision of Sargeras (YM)<br>
Slayer's Shoulderpads (YB)<br>
Slayer's Chestguard (YYB)<br>
Insidious Bands (Y)<br>
Slayer's Handguards (B)<br>
Slayer's Legguards (B)<br>
Shadowmaster's Boots (RY)<br>
<br>
So, the spreadsheet will tell you to use hit gems in every one of those sockets except the red socket in the boots, where you will want a hit/agi gem, meaning we'll need to swap out two hit gems for agi/sta.  Well, the natural place to put these blue gems is in the items with blue sockets, so as to activate set bonuses. Hence, the reasonable options for socketing with blue gems are the 4 slayer pieces.  The socket bonus on the chest is 8 AP, the shoulders 6 AP, and the legs/gloves 4 AP.  So we're clearly going to get the most mileage out of the blue gems by socketing them in the chest + shoulders to activate 14 AP of socket bonuses in addition to the metagem.<br>
<br>
Regarding the hit cap: again, recall that this sheet is designed to tell you which items our good, and an item with a lot of hit on it *is* good regardless of how much hit is currently on your gear, so the sheet wants to reflect that.  It just means you need to keep an eye on how much hit you've accumulated and not go overboard on it.</div>

</div>The other thing to keep in mind is that having your hit drop down from the cap is not fundamentally a bad thing.  There's nothing magical about being hit-capped.  Admittedly, having a low miss rate is advantageous to your DPS, but if you can get the same DPS increase via crit or AP or haste or other mods, that is in some ways even better than getting the DPS boost from haste.  So if it makes your DPS number go up to swap out for haste gear or whatever, it's worth doing, even if it makes your hit plummet - after all, hit is just a number, DPS output is what matters.</div>

		<div id="post_message_452415">I am a rogue, I have a question on Weapon Skill and Hit Rating and Crit.<br>
<br>
This seems to be a really gray area.<br>
<br>
From a few posts i have read and blogs:<br>
<br>
Vs a level 73 mob/boss without Weapon Skill or Precision.<br>
<br>
The hit rating needed is 403 according to various sources.<br>
<br>
If you add 10 Weapon Skill, then the Hit needed is 387.<br>
<br>
A difference in 16 (or more than likely 15.77) which is 1% hit.<br>
But also 10 weapon skill provides 1% Crit afaik.<br>
<br>
I'm interested in getting the most damage i can possibly get in a raid, this has previously been to stack hit, crit and ap where possible.<br>
<br>
A raid boss in most cases is just one small part of total raid damage, so i'm interested in maximising damage vs lvl 70,71,72 trash etc. How much hit should i be using, i can possibly reach 308 with precision and weapon skill, however vs most mobs, isnt this +hit going to waste? I am a great believer in equipment swapping, would it be worth swopping for example a +30ish hit rating item with a +ap/crit piece for fights vs lvl 72 trash. I feel the answer would be yes if my calculations are correct.<br>
<br>
So i need to know what the +hit needed for: lvl71,72 mob.<br>
<br>
I need to know what effects weapon skill has on these mobs, but the wowwiki posts on weapon skill arnt very clear as they contain a lot of potentially outdated pre-tbc info.<br>
<br>
Do they scale in a linear fashion, e.g <br>
<br>
White attacks vs opponents:<br>
Lvl 70 Hit needed: 378.5<br>
Lvl 71 Hit needed: 386.375<br>
Lvl 72 Hit needed: 394.25<br>
Lvl 73 Hit needed: 402.14<br>
<br>
Above are just examples from some math i did and might be entirely incorrect, would just like to know more how it really works.<br>
<br>
Thanks in advance.</div>

		<div id="post_message_452432">I might suggest taking a look at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071227031755/http://elitistjerks.com/f31/t11885-rogue_warrior_weapon_skill_adjustment_discussion/" target="_blank">[Rogue/Warrior] Weapon Skill Adjustment Discussion</a> which has a bunch of info on the specifics of weapon skill, but here's the general idea:<br>
<br>
If your weapon skill is simply the base 350, it takes a very large amount of hit to zero out your miss chance against level 73s; the base miss chance is something like 28%.<br>
<br>
Assuming you have at least 355 weapon skill *or* the mobs your facing are at most level 72, the following formula will tell you how much total hit you need:<br>
<br>
24% + (.5% per level of the mob over 70) - (.1% per point of weapon skill over 350)<br>
<br>
So, for instance, if you have 2/2 WEx, your base weapon skill is 360.  Thus, against, say, a level 71 mob, your base miss chance will be 24% + .5% - 1% = 23.5%.  If you additionally have precision, this means that you will cap out on hit rating once you have enough for 18.5% hit from hit rating; this works out to be 18.5*205/13 = ~292 hit rating as the cap with 2/2 WEx and 5/5 precision vs level 71 mobs.<br>
<br>
Similar calculations apply for other combinations of weapon skill and hit.<br>
<br>
Oh, and Re: assorted gear corrections: again, all will be in the next patch.  If you find any others let me know and I'll fix them too.</div>

</div>I would assert that the Ashtongue trinket is modeled in excrutiating detail in this sheet.  It's possible to squeeze a little bit extra out of it relative to the model here, but it's pretty darn good.<br>
<br>
Madness of the Betrayer, I'd need to know the proc rate before I can include it.  However, my suspicion is that it'll be slightly inferior, unless the proc rate is a lot higher than I would expect.  If you'd like to get me proc rate data, I'll give you a better answer.<br>
<br>
Similarly, proc rate data on the exalted hyjal ring would be helpful.<br>

</div>The only thing that's going to significantly warp the value of haste is interrupted fights, which, admittedly, are common.  Spreadsheets, such as this one, tend to ignore this problem and assume sustained endless combat, which is admittedly inaccurate but not by as much as you might think.<br>
<br>
So, basically, how haste rating works is: the sheet adds up all the sources of +haste you have, converts it to a %increase, and increases your attack speed by that much.  Not much to it, really.  I guess I'm not really sure what other ambiguities might exist, so if you have specific questions/issues feel free to raise them.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">The first thing I'd note is that for a rogue to only do 750 DPS, your gear needs to be fairly weak; using only quest rewards, BoEs, and 5man drops (not heroics - regular 5 mans) you can put together gear that will do that much unbuffed.  So for the average raiding rogue - which is who this sheet is targetted at - 750 DPS is very much low-end.<br>
<br>
Secondly, I don't think "unbuffed" is necessarily the fairest comparison.  Again, a typical raiding rogue is going to be using at least *some* buffs.<br>
<br>
So, with that in mind: yes, it's true that at low levels of gear, unbuffed, swords do not possess a particularly large advantage over the other available options.  However, I think it is fair to say that as gear increases, swords pull further and further ahead.  For instance, in my current armor with Arena 2 weapons, my buffed DPS with swords is about 1470.  Switching over to Arena 2 fist + dagger, it drops to 1430.<br>
<br>
Now, 40 DPS isn't a *huge* deal, but it is enough to say that swords are pretty clearly better from a PvE DPS perspective.  And, frankly, I would dispute the claim that they're inferior for PvP - the burst damage potential of Sword Spec is not to be underestimated.<br>
<br>
As to the underlying question regarding whether Sword Spec is modeled correctly: I was pretty careful to include everything, so as far as I know it should be correct.  This is not to say that there might not be a mistake somewhere - but I'd need something a little more specifically amiss than "swords don't beat fists by as much as I expected" in order to track it down.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</div>Hmm - well i have done calculation with boss mob defence on in which case i am pretty sure 750ish DPS unbuffed DPS is not too bad. <br>
<br>
With defence off my sheet shows this for combat swords (saved DPS is the fist/dagger);<br>
<br>
Total DPS	1045.61<br>
Total DPS	1874.15 (buffed)<br>
<br>
saved dps:	1041.47	<br>
saved dps:	1862.44 (buffed)<br>
<br>
difference:	4.13<br>
difference:	11.70 (buffed)<br>
<br>
In a lower damage gear set (my pvp kit) it is:<br>
<br>
Total DPS	925.70	<br>
Total DPS	1424.50<br>
<br>
saved dps:	925.62				<br>
saved dps:	1421.20<br>
 <br>
difference:     0.08<br>
difference:     3.03<br>
<br>
So even less. I suspect therefore that as the gear set gets weaker the fist/dagger option becomes more favourable and there will be a point of inflexion in there somewhere.<br>
<br>
So yeah the difference isn't that noticable but there clearly is a difference that means swords do a bit more damage - particularly at the higher end.</div>

</div>The thing is, I would argue that you *want* the best value across all cycles, as some of these bonuses (2/5 T4 come to mind) may significantly alter which cycle is optimal for you.  If, for instance, you're a dagger rogue and usually using 5sXr3s and then equip 2/5 T4, the benefit you gain is not that you simply can use a slightly larger rupture in your existing cycle; the advantage is that you get to shift to a totally different cycle, 5sXr.<br>
<br>
Basically, your method on the first few columns, where the benefits applied are small, is usually not going to make a difference relative to max, as you're either going to get the same answer or something very very close.  For the larger bonuses, however, using max captures the fact that some bonuses are significant enough that either a) they allow access to a cycle you previously could not sustain, or b) you adjust your cycle to make better use of them.  Either way, the relevant piece of information is what the maximum amount of DPS that can be squeezed out of the bonus is, and for that I think using max rather than indirect makes sense.</div>

</div>Well, I looked it over, and I don't see anything obviously wrong with the WSC comparison; even with my gear (which is in the sheet when it's downloaded), they're within ~5 AP (or 1.5 DPS) of each other, and the fact that you have some armor penetration stacked helps WSC from their.  Also, it appears that having mangle up increases the value of WSC relative to Ashtongue, to my mild surprise.  So, between the two - apparently, yes, WSC is comperable or superior to Ashtongue for you.<br>
<br>
Regarding the ring thing: it's a bug.  Sheet isn't counting the number of rings enchanted with each enchant, it's simply checking whether it's in use at all.  It's an easy fix, and I'll get it out this weekend along with the fixes for other bugs people have found (and, perhaps, a few new features, if I have time).<br>

</div>Well, it has been my perception that as gear improves, hit tends to increase in relative value (for instance, Surefooted passes +12 agi as a boot enchant at some point).  So I think the fact that those have hit is certainly a factor.<br>
<br>
Regarding Ashtongue in particular: seems like the sheet is estimating about 70% uptime for it.  To me, this seems fairly reasonable -  in ballpark figures, with a 3s5r type cycle, you expect to drop a proc every other cycle or so since the SnD only has a 60% chance to proc it, and there is perhaps a small gap after the SnD before you have 5 CPs for the rupture.  So 70% is at least a plausible number to me.  However, since I don't have the trinket (and probably won't for a darn long time, if ever), I can't really verify personally whether that's accurate or not; if you think the actual uptime is higher, I can adjust the model to reflect that (although I'd like to see some combat logs with actual uptime figures before doing so).  However, if we assume that the 70% number is in the right ballpark, it does appear that the trinket is comperable if not inferior to other available options.</div>

		<div id="post_message_453932">So, long story short: this haste nerf seems to me to be spectacularly stupid.<br>
<br>
Let's review:<br>
<br>
Previously, Dragonspine Trophy was disproportionately good, and a couple of items that dropped in BT and Hyjal that had haste on them were among the better options for their slot; the ideal end-game gear included two items with haste rating on them (Shadow-walker's Cord and Band of Devastation).<br>
<br>
Now, none of the haste rating items are optimal for their slot, and, in fact, most are inferior to vastly easier-to-get items...<br>
<br>
...and Dragonspine Trophy is still way overpowered.<br>
<br>
Doesn't seem to me that they really fixed the problem they were trying to, but what do I know.<br>
<br>
Anyway, next update of the sheet will have the new haste in it, but until then, here are some ballpark figures to use in the meantime:<br>
<br>
* Haste to gloves is no longer a viable enchant.<br>
* Swiftstrike Shoulders are now the 2nd best shoulders in the game, clearly inferior to T6 but still ahead of everything else (by a fair margin).<br>
* Crystalweave Cape no longer competes with epic cloaks.<br>
* Swiftstrike Bracers are now comperable to Deadly Cuffs and thus clearly inferior to Insidious Bands<br>
* Grips of Damnation are now comperable to Deathmantle Gloves, and vastly inferior to T6.<br>
* Shadow-walker's Cord is now comperable to Don Alejandro's Money Belt and Belt of Deep Shadow, and hence inferior to Belt of One-Hundred Deaths<br>
* Band of Devastation drops from the 2nd best ring to the 5th best ring, behind Stormrage Signet Ring, Band of Deceitful Intent, Ring of Lethality, and Band of the Ranger-General<br>
<br>
On the whole, it appears that there's still some value to swiftstrike shoulders, but, barring bad luck, by the time you get the other haste items you will probably already have something else that is as good or better.</div>

</div>Writing a parser to see when buffs start and end is certainly pretty straightforward; what's a little harder is figuring out when combats start and end.  I'll have to think about the best way to do such a thing.  When I figure something out I'll let you know.<br>
<br>
On an unrelated note: I think I'm going to take the Arena 1 armors out of the sheet; it's been long enough that I don't really expect too many people to be still using them, they're really not very good, and the armor lists for some slots is getting kind of long.  So unless there are profound objections, they will not be in 0.7.4,</div>

</div>And if they up the procrate on Warp-Spring and Tsunami by 100%, how would they compare (I've fucked around with them a bit on the PTR, since I don't have them on live. They never, ever proc).<br>
<br>
Your spreadsheet has the warp-spring at 107 value, barely better than hourglass of the unraveller, and not as good as abacus of violent odds (though haste re-evaluation should change that).<br>
<br>
Most, if not all of the value, seems to come from the latent stats, not from the proc itself.<br>
<br>
Assuming that DST loses 1/3 of its value (possibly more, given the windfury change, and issues with haste-stacking), it'll be down to 285, which is about double that of even the second place trinket.<br>
<br>
Including the whole haste-stacking thing, let's say a generic value of 220 for DST. <br>
<br>
Still overpowered? Yes, but not out of the realm of buffing other trinkets to points that they might be halfway comparable (ie. 160-180 values on your sheet for warp-spring/tsunami with increased procrate, maybe 215 for Ashtongue if they add some latent stats along the lines of 30 hit and 45 AP).</div>

</div>Just so we're clear - you're using 0.6.3, yes?  That has a bug that undervalues WSC.  The 0.7.x versions have an improved model for WSC, which have it scoring up in the 160-170 range for me, making it a serious competitor for your #2 trinket with DST.<br>

</div>Well, on my sheet, DST is currently scoring 550.  40 of this is AP, the other 510 is the proc.  Nerfing that 510 by 33% takes it to 340, meaning that the total trinket value would be about 380, aka more than the next two trinkets combined.<br>
<br>
Still overpowered?  Yeah, I'd say so. The othet trinkets obey a fairly sensible power progression (all scores with the default gear of the sheet):<br>
<br>
Preraid trinkets:<br>
Icon: 109<br>
Hourglass: 110<br>
Abacus: 111<br>
Bloodlust: 115<br>
<br>
Raid trinkets:<br>
Romulo's: 152<br>
Tsunami: 154<br>
WSC: 165<br>
Ashtongue: 170<br>
<br>
And then you have:<br>
DST: ~380<br>
<br>
Preraid trinkets are all of comperable quality, and raid trinkets all cluster in a pretty good range from 150-170.  And then you have DST, still scoring 380.  Now, 380 is better than 550 to be sure, but it's still in a totally different league of power.<br>
<br>
The better solution, in my opinion, would be to give DST a 30 sec internal cooldown, which would drop it from 550 to ~230 - still good, but much closer to the right ballpark, and wouldn't require rendering all the haste items in BT useless.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
I'm also at 280 hit-rating with my bow, of course, so the +hit on warp-spring and tsunami would be somewhat undervalued, but it's still annoying just how close together any level 70 trinket is to another.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Preraid trinkets are all of comperable quality, and raid trinkets all cluster in a pretty good range from 150-170.  And then you have DST, still scoring 380.  Now, 380 is better than 550 to be sure, but it's still in a totally different league of power.<br>
<br>
The better solution, in my opinion, would be to give DST a 30 sec internal cooldown, which would drop it from 550 to ~230 - still good, but much closer to the right ballpark, and wouldn't require rendering all the haste items in BT useless.</div>

	</table>
</div>Is the 380 including the issues involving the pre-2.0 fury warrior scaling of haste ratings with one another (abacus, latent haste, SnD, Blade Flurry, etc)? The 40, yeah, sure. But if you reduce the value of DST by 1/3, just from the haste alone, you also have to consider the effect it has on stacking.<br>
<br>
So, 340 haste might go to 300 even, leaving it at 340 all-told, which, again, leaves it within range to be rectified by buffs on other items, or mostly rectified.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Also, I think your assessment of the trinkets is perhaps skewed a bit by your low level of current itemization.  It sounds like those people currently wearing mostly SSC+ gear (i.e., those who will reasonably be picking up some of these trinkets) are finding Ashtongue and WSC to be worth relatively more than you are, which I assume has something to do with your lower itemization level.

<br>
Changes:<br>
*Assorted bug fixes from the last few pages.<br>
*Updated header text on front page.<br>
*Added gem description in addition to gem name.<br>
*Added unique and Black Temple gems.<br>
*Added advanced settings pages to allow modification of more paramaters.<br>
*Removed Arena 1 armor pieces.<br>
*Removed Necklace of the Deep, because it was breaking the sheet, would have been painful to fix, and, honestly, given that it's been broken for 3 months and no one complained, it couldn't have been getting much use anyway.<br>
*Included option to compare gear with or without the haste nerf.<br>
<br>
Only outstanding bug that I know of is the glove enchant issue; it appears to only occur in the Excel version, and I don't have Excel at home so I can't really diagnose it right now.<br>
<br>
I'm aware that this update makes the gem list a bit, um, unwieldly.  I'm thinking about solutions to this issue, but for the moment I wanted to get all the gems in.<br>

		<div id="post_message_454427"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->The only post that had the words "Balanced Nightseye" in it that was in this thread just had someone talking about using it to activate a socket bonus.  So, here goes.<br>
<br>
My alt recently got the Midnight legs from Quagmirran and I'm trying to figure out how to socket them.  The sheet is recommending that I use 1 Shifting Nightseye and 2 Glinting Noble Topazes.  This is a result of 12 agility, 12 hit rating, and 6 stamina (counting the hit socket bonus).  Two questions regarding this recommendation.<br>
<br>
One, why is it suggesting a Shifting Nightseye over a Balanced Nightseye?  I was under the  impression that 1 agility wasn't quite as good as 2 attack power in terms of DPS.  Hence, I would think that the 8 attack power would outweigh the 4 agility.<br>
<br>
Two, why isn't it suggesting 3 Rigid Dawnstones?  Everywhere else on the sheet a Rigid Dawnstone is the best gem to use.  This means than 4 hit rating &gt; 4 agility and that 4 hit rating &gt; 8 attack power.  Hence, gaining 12 hit rating would outweigh the 12 agility that the sheet recommends.  Is it the stamina causing the sheet to recommend the Nightseyes and Noble Topazes?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<!-- message -->
		<div id="post_message_454451"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->The relative merit of 1 agi vs 2 AP depends largely on your level of buff; with raid buffs, the agi tends to be better; unbuffed the AP tends to be better.  Make sure you have the buffs you feel appropriate selected on the "buffs" page - by default they're set to what's typical of 25 man raiding, which may or may not be approrpriate for you.<br>
<br>
As for the 2nd question:<br>
<br>
With whatever you have selected, it apparently feels you benefit more from the set bonus, and, looking at the comparison, it's a reasonable point to make.  Socketing with the recommended colors gives 12 agi 12 hit 6 sta; socketing straight hit gives 24 hit.  Hence the sheet is asserting that 12 agi and 6 sta is superior to 12 hit, which is almost certainly true if you have "Weighted Total" selected.  If you switch it to "Offense" you'll probably see the recommendation switch to all +8 hit gems.<br>
<br>
Basically: the socket bonus on Midnight Legguards is pretty good, and costs you very little DPS to get, so is likely worth going for.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_454544"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->For what it's worth, the suggestion I've heard (forget exactly which thread here had the link) for balancing sword and dagger raid dps seems to be very good as modeled by this sheet.  That is, making Opportunity a 3-point talent and making Aggression apply to backstab as well.  The changes to the usual 15/41/5 spec would make it 17/41/3 - getting 3/3 Ruthlessness, 5/5 Lethality, and picking up 3/3 Aggression in combat.<br>
<br>
I edited the 5s/Xr/3s sheet to apply Aggression to backstab, and the end result was swords being ahead by ~1% on murder-affected mobs and daggers being ahead by ~1% otherwise, given the same gear (t5/t6) and equivalent level weapons.<br>

<br>
I currently own 4 haste items (not counting the crafted two ones). I would like to start with the Gloves:<br>
<br>
Grips of Damnation<br>
Binds when picked upHands Leather <br>
277 Armor<br>
+27 Agility<br>
+38 Stamina<br>
Durability 40 / 40<br>
Requires Level 70 <br>
Equip: Improves haste rating by 37.<br>
Equip: Increases attack power by 76. <br>
  <br>
As a warrior you are getting this loot as a comparable one:<br>
Pillager's Gauntlets<br>
Binds when picked upHands Plate <br>
1103 Armor<br>
+38 Strength<br>
+45 Stamina<br>
Durability 55 / 55<br>
Requires Level 70 <br>
Equip: Improves hit rating by 18.<br>
Equip: Improves haste rating by 38.<br>
<br>
As in high-end raiding hit rating still remains a highly, if not the most important stat for a rogue, I would like to suggest a change to Grips of Damnation. Give them 18 hit Rating as the Plate Version and either reduce Agility or Attack Power on them accordingly. After collecting four BT Haste Rating Items this the one that I would see the one that now (after the Haste nerf for Melee) would need a change for High-End Raiders.<br>
<br>
Shadow-Walker's Cord is from my point very well balanced even after 2.2<br>
<br>
After acquiring two Bands of Devastation I don't see now any point of continuing to wear them after 2.2. Before the haste rating change they were well balanced even considering their waste of iLvL in favor of stamina. They are at most now an alternative for fights as Reliquary of Souls where you basically always end up tanking.<br>
<br>
So what do other Black Temple experienced people or Rogues well experienced with calculating dps think of changing those items and how?<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">How about if Blizzard would change dagger spec (and fist spec) so that 5/5 dagger specialization would give a 7% increase to crit rate ?<br>
<br>
It would make pve damage more balanced with swords.<br>
But it would also make the pvp crowd more likely to pick daggers.<br>
And it would make people happy, who still live in the pre-TBC days, and who think that crit rate is the most important stat. And that seems to be a lot of people.</div>
			
		</td>

</div>That would be another way to balance.  However, I think it's somewhat less likely to actually be done.  Setting aside for the moment the way *I* think things should be balanced, I think it's just a lot more likely that blizzard will solve this by nerfing sword spec than buffing dagger spec.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Uhoh. Since we've passed t5 instances and won't probably run them much after Illidan it seems I'm out of options to get my +5 skill from any of those. There is a certain ring in Lower City. <br>
For spreadsheet calculations can I simply replace the +5skill with 2.5% hit? (vs Bosses at least)<br>
In fact I'll check that now.<br>

This change implied to me that (at least for mutilate) Shapeshifter's Signet is the 6th best ring for mutilate if you do not have any of the three alternatives mentioned above by Aldriana.<br>

Of course seeing how these results are from the other spreadsheet they probably hold no relevancy to this thread. Perhaps add this to the Rogue theorycrafting thread?<br>

Edit. Hmm, actually wouldn't it be relative 3% hit increase ? 2.5% from the 350-&gt;355 and then 0.1% from the skill itself (0.1% per skill or whatnot). Or am I wrong at this?</div>

</div>I don't think we'll see tweaks to any of the items, to be honest. The only place where the nerf really seems to break the intended progression implied by the item levels involved is Band of Devestation, as it's inferior to multiple items of lower ilvl. You could make a case that Shadow-Walker's Cord is in the same boat due to both Don Rodrigo's Money Belt and the Vashj belt being superior(an even-level and a -3). If they were going to tweak them, the easiest way to fix them is subtracting stats and adding yellow/red sockets + bonuses. <br>
<br>
My bet is that while doing Zul'aman internal testing they ended up finding some sort of degenerate interaction between existing haste gear and new items that caused them to renerf it.<br>

</div>I agree with you on the gloves.  They are now such a small upgrade for me over Deathmantle (less than 10 AP according to Aldriana's spreadsheet here) that I will save my DKP for t6 and its set bonuses.<br>
<br>
We have had terrible luck with the haste rings (which I am now grateful for) so I will not bother to pick up them at all and they will be void crystals from here on out.  <br>
<br>
As to the belt, I disagree.  I was quite unhappy to read this nerf the day after I spent DKP on it.  It went from the best in slot item to being worse than my crafted belt.  As soon as the change goes likve the shadow-walker's cord goes into the bank until such time as Blizzard re-itemizes in light of this nerf (unlikely).  <br>
<br>
PS. I should clarify that we use zero-sum dkp so its not like we can pick stuff up "on the cheap" now that they are less desirable.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Well I've been playing mutilate since the 2.0 with some forays into swords from time to time. I can agree that Mutilate won't probably beat swords (at least at the moment, before the haste nerf) it offers a very viable spec for high-end raiding that provides a challenge to play. (Not that xs/5r is easy to play or anything.)<br>
However for mutilate to work you really need to itemize your gear (and if possible group setup) for it. <br>
Also 4 pieces of T5, Ashtongue Trinket. <br>
Agility over hit (I value Agility &gt; Hit &gt; Crit &gt;= AP myself) <br>
You gain little by pushing very high hit with mutilate (although 4pc T5 gains some increase in proc frequency from the extra hit)<br>
<br>
Feral Druid. Being without one really hurts. (even though with raidbuffs and Ashtongue trinket I'm avg 38% crit according to swstats<br>
These things really add quite a bit to mutilate dps. <br>
<br>
And above all I have fun playing mutilate. And as serious business as WoW might be I still play it to have Fun.<br>
<br>
I hope Aldriana will someday integrate Mutilate support for this spreadsheet. But seeing how the combat part still needs some tweaking... Well let's just say I won't hold my breath for too long.<br>

</div>I'm actually pretty happy with the underlying computations for combat at this stage - they certainly have a few quirks in places, but on the whole I think they're pretty close.  The next round of improvements I want to make are mostly UI changes plus assorted bug fixes.<br>
<br>
Regarding Mutilate specifically, there are multiple issues that make it challenging:<br>
<br>
1) Mutilate cycles just plain work totally differently from SS, BS, and Hemo cycles, due to the "chunkiness" of Mutilate; with SS, BS, and Hemo, you can control exactly how big an SnD or Rupture you're using.  With Mutilate, this doesn't work; you launch mutilates until you have 'enough' combo points (conventional wisdom is that "enough" means 4), and then launch a finisher.  Moreover, once you launch a finisher, you don't have a neat rotation like XsYr; rather, you just sort of check and see what ability is in need of using (i.e., do I need to refresh SnD?  No? Okay, what about Rupture?  No?  Okay, then Envenom).  While I do have some idea how to go about modeling this, my concern is that it's going to smooth things out too much.  My experience with Mutilate is that there's a fair amount of slop in the cycles - lots of wasted SnD uptime and/or SnD gaps, and so on.  The sheet, on the other hand, would have a tendency to model the ideal cycle - no SnD downtime, but no SnD gaps, either - which is hard to do in practice.<br>
<br>
2) Seal Fate makes cycle computation messy.  For those of you that have looked at the calculation pages, you'll have seen that I manually iterate a cycle-selection calculation 3 times to get the right cycle before doing the damage calculations.  With seal fate, this calculation block would need to be significantly longer, as 1) you have to compute crit chance in each cycle, and 2) SF tends to have a fairly large effect on cycles so you may need to iterate it more times to get accurate results.  As such, the calculations page for Mutilate could easily be twice the length of the calculations page for any of the existing cycles.<br>
<br>
3) Weapon speed.  The method I'm using for estimating the damage contribution of weapon speed sort of relies on the fact that we're operating in a fairly narrow range of speeds; regardless of what OH weapon you're using, all other reasonable OH options are within at most .2 speed of what you're using.  With Mutilate, on the other hand, your OH can be up to .6 speed different, which is going to exacerbate the nonlinearities that are already present at .2.  As such, the OH Weapon Speed calculation would need to work totally differently.<br>
<br>
So, long story short: there are some fairly fundamental issues with Mutilate that are holding back development, not the least of which is the fact that I have very little raid experience as Mutilate.  I'm not averse to adding it to the sheet at some future date, but I'm not going to add it until I figure out how to do it right, and certainly not until I get the (smaller and easier) UI changes up and running as well.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>The only two things I can think of off the top of my head that would be affected are Combat Potency and Deadly Poison.  You can't have Combat Potency as Mutilate, so that's not an issue.

		<div id="post_message_457497"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Conventional wisdom is that the typical Mutilate build makes use of Envenom, such that you're repeatedly dumping all your DP stack and need to get them back as quickly as possible.  That's the selection pressure keeping weapon speed down.  The selection pressure keeping weapon speed up is the fact that you're making instant attacks with your OH makes slow weapons a good thing, both in terms of increased damage and in terms of increased proc chance of PPM procs.  Neither of these selection effects is probably as strong as combat potency, but the point remains that you have two selection forces pushing in opposite directions, so figuring out what is optimal is a bit harder than in the SS/BS/Hemo case where all selection effects are trying to push weapon speed down.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

	</table>
</div>Putting in my current gear (see armory) with a standard raiding swords build has it saying my Optimal Hit is 247 (current 295).  This is very strange, since the Optimal gem recommendations actually include MORE gems with +hit than I currently have.  How can it calculate an Optimal Hit rating being 48 less than it currently is, while calculating having more hit gems as being Optimal?<br>
<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">So, I finally got around to downloading and playing with this spreadsheet (v.0.7.4 - OO), after being a long time "DPS Spreadsheet" user.  There seems to be something very strange going on with Optimal Hit.  You say:<br>
<br>
<br>
Putting in my current gear (see armory) with a standard raiding swords build has it saying my Optimal Hit is 247 (current 295).  This is very strange, since the Optimal gem recommendations actually include MORE gems with +hit than I currently have.  How can it calculate an Optimal Hit rating being 48 less than it currently is, while calculating having more hit gems as being Optimal?<br>
<br>

</div>Yes.  The spreadsheet suggests it, as it should.  Deathmantle helm is an upgrade over Netherblade.  The fact that you can't realize that upgrade right now notwithstanding, it *is* an upgrade.  Eventually you do want to switch to it - you just need to get an upgrade for the other slot as well.<br>
<br>
The spreadsheet does not factor in set bonuses when recommending upgrades; this is why there's a separate page to tell you exactly how much each set bonus is worth, so you can figure out for yourself which gear upgrades are actually sensible at the given time.  <br>
<br>
As an example of why the set bonuses are *not* included in the recommendations: if they were, and you were wearing 4/5 T5, you would never be allowed to break it, as no one piece of T6 is sufficient to make up for the 4/5 set bonus.  However, in reality, T6 is better, both because each piece is significantly better than it's T5 counterpart, and because both set bonuses are very good as well.  Hence, you want the sheet to tell you that T6 is good, even if you do need 2 pieces of it before you break the 4/5 T5 bonus.<br>
<br>
Again: the spreadsheet computes upgrades on a slot-by-slot basis.  It does not and cannot look at interactions between them.  It is a tool to help you make decisions.  It is not a replacement for independant thought.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Here's another interpretation:<br>
<br>
All calculations are based off of your current stats.  Hence, when you change gear, the value of stats changes.  As such, items can change in relative value by a few AP in either direction.  Hence, differences of less than 5 AP should be taken with a grain of salt.</div>

This would probably be quite a bit of work though because you would have to calculate stat values for each slot seperately.<br>
Also it's probably not even worth fixing anyway because in every case this happens the difference is less than 1 dps and you shouldn't base your gear choices on that <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080117040448im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/wink.gif" border="0" alt="" title=";)" class="inlineimg"></div>

</div>On the whole, I would argue that there's adequate coverage for pre/early Kara rogues.  I admit that there are a few slots where there is a shortage of options (chest, waist, and rings come to mind), and I will consider adding stuff to those slots.  With regards to Stealther's Helm: if you're starting Karazhan, you have Helm of the Claw, which is strictly better, so I fail to see much point in wearing something that no one should be using for even the beginning of Kara.<br>
<br>
In a larger sense, the issue is that the assumptions that make a sheet like this possible don't even really become valid until you get the longer fights of 25 mans; hence, the sheet isn't particularly accurate for Karazhan, much less 5-mans and heroics.  Thus, in the interest of usability, I've tried to restrict gear to stuff that someone starting 25-man raiding might reasonably be wearing, which *should* be mostly Kara-level gear with a sprinkling of blies not replaced yet.<br>
<br>
To be perfectly honest, I've actually thought about cutting down the gear lists further, as there are some items that I doubt see much use by anyone, and some of the lists for various slots are getting annoyingly long.  For instance, the following items strike me as unlikely to be used by any soon-to-be-raiding rogue, due to being significantly inferior to an easier-to-get item:<br>
<br>
Gladiator's Helm<br>
Cobrascale Hood<br>
Pendant of Triumph<br>
Gladiator's Leather Spaulders<br>
Sun-Gilded Shouldercaps<br>
Gladiator's Leather Gloves<br>
Gloves of the Unbound<br>
Gladiator's Leather Legguards<br>
Shadowstep Striders<br>
Legionkiller<br>
<br>
Barring major objections, I will probably remove these in some future revision.<br>
<br>
Also note that you can always add your own gear to the sheet if you really want to.  It's not the easiest thing in the world to do, but it can be done.  I just think that most of what's not in here is excluded for good reason.<br>

</div>It's an interesting idea, to be sure, but it's not really possible with the current organization of the sheet.  To get that working would require either A) using an unholy abomination of macros, like the Rogue DPS sheet (which I'd prefer to avoid), B) rewriting the sheet with about 100 extra calculation pages (which has all sorts of bad consequences, not the least of which is the effort involves in writing 100 calculation pages), or C) writing this all in a real programming language (which I won't say will never happen, but don't expect it anytime soon.<br>
<br>
Also, as you note, differences of less than 1 DPS aren't particularly concerning, so fixing it is pretty far down on my priority list.</div>

</div>I typed in your gear from the Armory, although it won't let me load your spec right now.  Anyway, loading up the cookie-cutter 15/41/5 daggers spec, I get a recommendation of 1s/3.01r.  Looking over the calculation pages - I don't see any major problems, myself.  It does look like that cycle should be sustainable.<br>

</div>I actually got the idea to include the 1s/Xr cycles because a rogue in another thread had commented that he had good luck with a 3s/3r cycle.  So people have at least played with such things.  The general theory is that the DPS of rupture actually holds pretty steady from 3 to 5 points; what you mostly lose is duration.  A 3 point rupture lasts for 12 seconds while a 5 point rupture lasts for 16, but the damage over that duration is only 11 DPS lower.  As such, if compressing the cycle heavily allows you to get significantly higher uptime, it's potentially a better cycle than a cycle with a longer rupture.<br>
<br>
In fact, thinking about it a bit more, with daggers, longer SnDs don't actually allow you to increase the rupture size very much.  Consider: increasing the SnD by one point gives you an extra 4.35 seconds of uptime.  Typical energy regen with combat potency is about 13 energy per second; hence, you generate roughly 56.55 energy.  The extra backstab to get that combo point costs 55 energy (60 minus 5 for relentless strikes).  So increasing SnD size by 1 buys you <b>less than two energy</b> to go towards a rupture.<br>
<br>
We see this in practice on the calc sheet; with your gear and the spec I have plugged in, the 1sXr cycle recommendation is 1s3.01r.  The best 5s/Xr cycle it can come up with is 1s3.05r.  So doubling your cycle length from 17.4 to 34.8 seconds buys you, um, basically nothing in terms of the rupture.  It's not hard to see why the shorter cycle is potentially better.<br>

Speaking of which: I have a decent-sized wish list of UI improvements that I would like to make at some point, not all of which I know how to do.  As such, if there are any of you who are pretty good with Excel/OO and would like to help with the UI aspects of the sheet, let me know.<br>

In other news, thanks to some nice testing by Uhohzombies in the Mechanics Testing thread, we now have the proc rate for Madness of the Betrayer - it appears to be a 1 PPM proc (shockingly enough, given that everything else is).  So I'll be adding that to the next version as well; as a an estimate in the meantime, it does appear to be slightly superior to both Ashtongue Talisman of Lethality and Warp Spring Coil for a sword rogue.</div>

Now I'm struggling to find out what to think of armour reduction in a raid situation. Your sheet gives me a rough DPS value of 1500 while in the real world I average about 1300.

Making this parameter (and several others such as the weighting for "weighted total") more accessible is being planned for a future version (probably 0.7).  We're thinking of adding an "advanced settings" page that will allow adjustment of these parameters directly.</div>

Thanks for all the work on this.

<br>
I also have a couple of questions.  <br>
<br>
First, I'm human and using swords but when I switch back and forth between human and NE the current hit value doesn't change.  Does the spreadsheet take into account the human racial bonus to sword skill?  <br>
<br>
Second, how is optimal hit calculated?  In particular it's saying that my current hit is 235 and my optimal is 251.  To the best of my knowledge neither 235 nor 215 is hit capped even with the human racial and using swords with Latro's as an offhand. So shouldn't my optimal hit be whatever the cap is-294?</div>

		<div id="post_message_442791" class="post_message_underline" style="min-height: 183px;">It's sort of a combination of things that are holding up the show at this point.<br>
<br>
1) Mechanics testing.  For the most part, this is in decent shape; I was waiting on this for a while, but at this point I'm mostly at the point where I'm either going to take my best guess or leave out the offending piece of gear for the moment... and mostly the former, probably, given that testing so far has led me to the following rule of thumb:<br>
<br>
<i>All weapon procs are probably 1PPM in absence of significant evidence to the contrary</i><br>
<br>
So, for things that haven't been tested yet (Siphon of the Nathrezim and Blacksmithing Hammers, for instance) I'll probably just fill in 1 PPM for now and will change it later if necessary.<br>
<br>
The only outstanding thing here that I'm at all concerned about is the T5 4/5 proc rate.  This turns out to be sort of a difficult effect to model, and I really have no good data on what the answer might be.  The limited testing I've seen so far makes it appear that the answer is most likely not 1 PPM, so I don't have a good feeling on what to plug in as an estimate.  Still, this by itself wouldn't be holding me up - I'd just take my best guess and move on.<br>
<br>
2) The new calc sheets are a slightly larger job that I originally estimated - there are a few subtleties to implementing them that I didn't initially appreciate, and the planned number of sheets has increased from 7 to 11 (of which 5 are mostly complete, all of which are significantly larger than either calculation sheet in 0.6.3).  So they're taking a bit more time than I originally expected.<br>
<br>
3) The other thing holding up the show at the moment is a sort of communications mixup between Darlal and myself.  In order to support the underlying mechanic changes, there are some UI improvements that need to be made; additionally, there are some general UI improvements that would nice to have made at some point (for instance, the unique gem issue).  He and I discussed these about 2 weeks ago, and he indicated that he thought he might have time to make at least some of them... and I haven't heard from him since.  I guess he got busy with work or whatever.  Now, normally, this wouldn't be a problem; I'd just take a day or two, figure out how to do the UI stuff myself, and plow forwards.  What I'm concerned about, though, is the possibility that he might have started work on some of the more sophisticated changes; if I make the basic changes and then pound out 0.7 based on that + the new calculation sheets, and then he shows up with a version with all sorts of neat UI fixes... we have sort of a problem in terms of merging two fairly sophisticated sets of changes back into one sheet.  So I sort of hate to move forwards until I know what his status is.<br>
<br>
Anyway: I haven't forgotten about this sheet, and I am still working on it, but I don't really have a good time estimate as to when everything will be done.</div>

As some of you may have heard (or not), in addition to the blanket haste nerf next patch, they also appear to be adding an internal cooldown to Dragonspine Trophy.  Based on 15 min in Blasted Lands last night, said internal cooldown appears to be 20 seconds.  So, if you're like me, you're probably wondering what this does to the value of the trinket.<br>
<br>
And the answer is: it's still the best trinket in the game by a decent margin.  I hacked a copy of the spreadsheet to model this, and I come up with the following valuations of trinkets (assuming my gear/spec):<br>
<br>
Dragonspine Trophy: 238<br>
Madness of the Betrayer: 176<br>
Ashtongue Talisman: 170<br>
Warp-Spring Coil: 156<br>
Tsunami Talisman: 149<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Public service announcement:<br>
<br>
As some of you may have heard (or not), in addition to the blanket haste nerf next patch, they also appear to be adding an internal cooldown to Dragonspine Trophy.  Based on 15 min in Blasted Lands last night, said internal cooldown appears to be 20 seconds.  So, if you're like me, you're probably wondering what this does to the value of the trinket.<br>
<br>
And the answer is: it's still the best trinket in the game by a decent margin.  I hacked a copy of the spreadsheet to model this, and I come up with the following valuations of trinkets (assuming my gear/spec):<br>
<br>
Dragonspine Trophy: 238<br>
Madness of the Betrayer: 176<br>
Ashtongue Talisman: 170<br>
Warp-Spring Coil: 156<br>
Tsunami Talisman: 149<br>

		<div id="post_message_468300"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I haven't played my rogue since BC came out and I rerolled Paladin. I've recently been playing my rogue again and just hit 69. I came across the anesthetic poison. I was wondering if someone could answer for me which is a better poison to use as far as raiding instant poisons? I noticed that anesthetic has about 30 less damage then instant. Is the "no additional threat" mechanic in Anesthetic effective enough to overcome the damage you lose from poisons? It seems like one would rather use anesthetic, but I'm not sure if I'm missing something.<br>

		<div id="post_message_468310"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Depends on the fight, and your tank.  On most fights, if your tank has good aggro, you can basically go all out using only vanish as your aggro dump, hence the zero-threat mechanic is irrelevant and you might as well use instant poison.  However, on fights with frequent aggro resets and/or deaggros, particularly if your tanks aggro is a bit sub-par, the zero threat can be useful.<br>
<br>
As a rule of thumb: use Instant Poison unless you have significant reason to do otherwise.  If you find yourself feinting constantly and/or needing to hold fire to avoid pulling aggro, then switch over to Anaesthetic.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Well, I would argue that if your rogues are pulling aggro frequently, then either a) they need to get better at managing the use of vanish or b) your tanks aggro could use some help.  For instance, I would argue that the only fight in SSC/TK where the aggro situation is such that vanish + a good tank isn't necessarily equal to the task is probably Leo.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Poison isn't a huge contributor to Rogue TPS. 187 damage (w/ 1/5 Vile) every 2 seconds, or 75ish TPS). Compared to the 900-1200 DPS that your rogue's putting out, it won't make or break the bank, but, if you're having issues with debuff slots anyway, might as well use Anesthetic instead of instant/deadly, since it's not a terrifyingly huge DPS loss, but does help a bit on fights where you might have some issue with aggro (See Warrior offtank on Gruul).<br>

</div>I would argue that, in a vacuum, the shoulders (and helm, if you're not an engineer) are both more worthwhile than the legs, which are a sidegrade to Skulker's.  But the real value of T5 is in... guess what... the set bonus.  Assuming I have the 4/5 T5 set bonus proc rate even close to right in this sheet (and I think I do), one actually gets a significant DPS boost from the set bonus which makes 4/5 T5 worth using well into MH/BT (in particular, it's not worth breaking until you can get 2/5 T6).<br>
<br>
Also, I'd again point out that there's no mystical significance to being at the hit-cap.  With my current gear setup I'm at 274, and I do more damage than ever before.  Sure, you can get pretty good stats with Karazhan + Heroic gear.  But you can get even better stats with SC/TK gear, and better still with MH/BT gear (assuming you pick the right pieces, of course - but that's why we have spreadsheets for that sort of thing).<br>

</div>I disagree with this.  While it's true that eventually all set bonuses end up getting broken, that's no reason not to make as much use as possible of them in the meantime.  Sure, eventually you're going to want to break 4/5 T5 to go to T6, but in between you clear about a dozen bosses and there's no reason no to use the damage output from 4/5 in the meantime.<br>
<br>
In the specific case of WW 2/5: you already have it, so you might as well wear it.  This doesn't mean you shouldn't pick up upgrades for those slots at some point; what it means is that if you pick up an upgrade for one slot and are deciding whether to wear it immediately or wait until you get another upgrade, you should factor in the set bonus.  Is it worth getting T5 shoulders over WW?  Obviously.  But should you equip them the moment you get them, breaking the 2/5 set bonus?  Probably not; you should wait till you have an upgrade for the other slot as well.<br>

</div>While it's true that attention to detail while actually playing is a larger factor, it's also true that paying adequate attention to get to 95% of the damage potential of your gear isn't particularly hard on the vast majority of fights.<br>
<br>
Additionally, the effect of gear is not to be underestimated; it's not unreasonable for one's damage output to roughly double from early Kara-level gear to end-BT level gear.  So while it's certainly not the only effect that effects your damage output, or even the largest one, it's certainly non-negligible.<br>
<br>
Besides which, I would argue that if a question is posted on a gear comparison spreadsheet thread, the questioner is sufficiently interested in optomizing his gear that it's worth getting the answer right; even if the right gear selection was only 1% of your total damage output (and it's a lot more than that), that doesn't mean it isn't worth doing right.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_469304"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I can't agree more with Aldriana. 4 piece t5 is almost equal to 2 piece t6 and at that point the stat increase from t6 tips the balance in it's favor. For that effect I really would've preferred t5 chest over bloodsea (not that either dropped for me... Conniver-&gt;T6...), since you're not swapping that out any time soon. Helm...is a tricky thing. If you want 4piece as soon as possible it's easier to kill Archimonde, but on the long run holding T5 Head-Chest-Legs-Shoulders with T6 gloves until you can pick up Chest/Shoulder/Pants is really worth it. And Illidan helm is superior to T6 anyway so you're not sacrificing a lot. <br>
<br>
Before that breaking t5 is rather pointless. Especially if you take note of the haste nerf. Not many non-set items are available (if any?) besides the soon-to-be nerfed haste itemization.<br>
So there really isn't any reason not to take t5. You shouldn't be hit starved anyway at that point so that's not a issue (Deep Shadows with 2x 8hit, WSC/Tsunami). Overall the offensive stat increase on t5 covers any lost hit anyway.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">...as near as I can tell, it's computing DPS in an abstracted situation that doesn't actually occur in any real fight. The assumptions about sustainability aren't even valid for Patchwerk, much less any other fight. It's calculating the numbers assuming, roughly speaking, a fight of infinite length against a stationary target with no tea use. Whereas in practice, the longest uninterrupted stationary fight we have is Patchwerk at 7 minutes, and that's short enough that the edge effects do matter. So, yes, as a theoretical exercise in damage computation, it's fine - but has nothing to do with any real situation, even neglecting the issues of stamina and survivability.</div>

</div>I wanted to respond to this, even though the quote is really old, given how I was one of the authors of the original DPS sheet. The caveat that it only works for sustained fights is very much true, and this was something that I tried to make clear whenever describing the sheet.<br>
<br>
However, I disagree that the sheet was inaccurate for a fight like Patchwerk. Perhaps it was in your usage case, but at least for me it was extremely accurate.

...of course, this is all purely hypothetical, as, only having killed Kael for the first time last week, it'll probably be a while before I have access to any T6 at all.

</div>Admittedly, when I made that quote I was to some extent exaggerating for effect; however, I do think there is some merit in the assertion.  My particular argument is that endless combat does not consider the fact that you A) start with one hundred energy or B) can squeeze two ARs into a 7 minute fight.  When you work it out, your actual available energy for the fight was more like 4600 (4200 + 100 starting + 2x150 AR) than the 4410 (4200 + 1.4x150 AR) that sheet predicted.  And while a 5% energy discrepancy is not a *huge* deviation from theory, it is enough to tweak the white/yellow damage balance a bit, which will in turn cause slight adjustments in the value of stats, such that if two items of very comparable quality were modeled (such as, for instance, Bonescythe Belt and Belt of Never-Ending Agony or Deathdealer's Vest and Bonescythe Breastplate), the answers could change a bit relative to the endless combat model.<br>
<br>
More to the point, at the time it was actually possible to do better; I included in the sheet I had been using at the time a parameter by which one could adjust the number of seconds of autoattack damage that you were able to perform between each backstab, on average; in an endless combat model, neglecting AR, this would be 7.8, in that you have 6 seconds between backstabs and 30% haste active from SnD.  However, when I measured this parameter in actual fights, I found it tended to range from about 5 (on Chromaggus, Twin Emps, and the like) up to a little over 7 (for fights like Patchwerk).  I could then adjust this parameter within my sheet to get valid DPS numbers over a range of fights, which I considered to be a superior implementation (in terms of accuracy if not user-friendliness) at the time.<br>

</div>In the expansion, I certainly agree; the fact that white and yellow damage can no longer be easily separated as they could pre-expansion due to Combat Potency, haste procs, cycle maintenance, and so on means a more sophisticated model of the interaction is necessary.  In the expansion, to obtain truly accurate results, one must know the exact uptime/downtime pattern of the fight to get good results, which is just not practical.  Hence, a sustained calculator is about the best you can do - which is why this sheet is what it is.  However, I do maintain that preexpansion mechanics were sufficiently straightforward that modeling interrupted fights was possible.<br>
<br>
As long as we're on the topic, I should mention that I've been thinking about this problem for a few weeks, and I'm starting to get some ideas about how to model  more interrupted fights.  I haven't solved all the issues yet, but I do think it might be possible to put together a useful if not perfectly accurate model of interrupted combat; as I'm starting to run low on other features to implement, I may try to build such a thing in at some future date.  No promises, but it is something that I'd like to try to do.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Your sheet continues to show Skulkers as being superior to Deathmantle (14 AP equivalent for my gear) , which I understand in a 1 against the other comparison.  However, if I were to pick up t6 helm (74 AP equivalent over Deathmantle), would the helm upgrade plus the deathmantle to skulkers switch be worth it to drop 4/5 DM?

</div>Uh, If I remember correctly the spreadsheet didn't add the dps increase from the set bonuses (otherwise it wouldn't suggest any single t6 piece over 4pc t5). So to check if it's worth losing 4 piece dm you need to consult the Set Bonus Values on the Spreadsheet.<br>
I'm pretty sure that it wouldn't be worth it though. Only reason to break 4/5 DM is 2/5 Slayer's.<br>
Other than that I don't see any combination that would break it.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_469431"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Well, the short answer would be "plug it into the spreadsheet and find out" - the "Rough DPS" estimate should be adequate to figure this out.  The somewhat longer answer would be that it depends on a variety of factors, but probably not.<br>
<br>
1) First, Skulker's are really only a 14 AP upgrade assuming you're able to socket them with BT gems, which, depending on your guild's gear situation, may or may not be possible; if you're comparing socketing with Blue gems in both cases, Skulker's is a sidegrade more than an upgrade to Deathmantle.<br>
<br>
2) It somewhat depends on where you are on the hit and stamina spectrum.  If you're anywhere near the hit cap (which, depending on what sort of fights you're doing these days, can be reasonably considered to be as low as 284), you may not have the room under the hit cap to absorb the full benefit of Skulker's Greaves.  On the other hand, one of the benefits of Deathmantle that keeps them somewhat close is that it presents a significant stamina upgrade, which, if it's not necessary for you at the moment, may reasonably be discounted as a benefit thereof.  So if you're high on hit and/or low on sta, Skulkers is probably not a good choice.<br>
<br>
But, assuming for the moment that neither 1 nor 2 applies, that you have sufficient epic gems available to gem your Karazhan gear, and the hit and sta factors do not apply, in terms of raw damage output, it *still* looks to me like 4/5 is good enough that Slayer's Helm + Skulker's Greaves is insufficient reason to break it; not by a whole heck of a lot, of course, but even with BT gems I only count an 81 AP upgrade for Slayer's Helm over Deathmantle, compared to a 116 AP bonus from 4/5.  So it would take a 2nd upgrade on the order of 35 AP to qualify, and Skulker's over Deathmantle does not qualify.<br>
<br>
All in all: for a variety of circumstantial reasons as well as the straight-up-damage argument, I'm reasonably confident that breaking 4/5 T5 without getting 2/5 T6 is never worthwhile... <b>assuming</b> that I have the proc rate for 4/5 anywhere close to right.  However, as I have mentioned before, the 4/5 number is purely an estimate, and until Vashj gets around to cooperating (she hasn't dropped a rogue helm in close to a month), I have no ability to test the accuracy of it.  So it may be that I am over (or under) estimating the value of 4/5, so take all this analysis with a grain of salt until someone gets around to testing that proc rate.<br>
<br>
On a related note, I'd also still be intereted in seeing proc rate info for Band of the Eternal Champion, if someone who has it would like to do some testing.  Or, alternately, if someone would like to invite me to an end-hyjal guild so I can rep up and test myself... <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080330030549im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":)" class="inlineimg">.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_470591">With enough haste and hit, a very fast OH, and 2/5 T4, one can run into a situation where 1s5r cycles can be completed in under 16 seconds, meaning that you have a bit of slack energy that could theoretically be used to maintain a longer cycle.  However, I'm not aware of any proposals better than "ignore the problem and keep doing 1s/5r" for dealing with this situation.  1s5e and 1s5r1e can both be shown to be inferior with relative ease, meaning that the next "compressed" cycle achievable is 1s5r2e, which is at best marginally superior and in practice requires unattainable energy regen (as I recall).  The other alternative would be to return to longer cycles and do something of the form 5s5rXe.  I haven't run detailed numbers on this, but my feeling is that it's most likely inferior as well, given that such a cycle will only achieve ~50% rupture uptime which offsets the damage gained by eviscerate.  So, at the moment, I think the best known option is to just stick with 1s5r.<br>
<br>
On a related note, it might also be noted that there exists an itemization level past which 1s5r is no longer optimal; when ones gear reaches this level, it actually becomes optimal to do 5s5r even if you could support a shorter cycle.  But I don't think there are many (if any) rogues that are quite at that level yet, so it's not a major concern <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080130060420im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":)" class="inlineimg">.</div>

		<div id="post_message_470651">Roughly.  I mean, the fundamental idea is as follows:<br>
<br>
In a 5s/5r cycle with Relentless Strikes, the SnD and Rupture are free.  So all energy is going into sinister strikes.<br>
<br>
In a 1s/5r cycle, the rupture is free but the SnD costs, on average, 20 energy.  Hence, only about 90% of your energy regen is going to sinister strikes.<br>
<br>
Hence, with 1s/5r, you are actually launching about 10% fewer Sinister Strikes per unit time than with a 5s/5r cycle.  At most reasonable levels of itemization, the is outweighed by the 50% increase is Rupture uptime.<br>
<br>
However, if your AP and Crit% get high enough, it is theoretically possible to reach a point where the extra sinister strikes will do more damage than the extra rupture uptime, and at this point, 5s5r takes over as the optimal cycle.<br>
<br>
Now, it takes a *lot* of AP and Crit (and, I guess, armor penetration) before this happens; I'm not sure if items actually exist that are equal to the task.  But from a purely theoretical standpoint, it could happen.  I'll try to dredge up my numbers on where the crossover point is in the next day or two.</div>

</div>With the Merciless gladiator's weapons, i've seen sinister strike crits near or over 2K, about the same as a 5 point eviscerate.<br>
The reason rupture is good, is because it costs 10 energy less than eviscerate and thus has a much lower energy "bleed" which will allow you a more steady finisher rotation. That, and it works very nicely if you have a feral druid in the raid doing Mangle.<br>
<br>
With 2 pieces of Netherblade, you'll probably be using a typical 1s/5r cycle.<br>

		<div id="post_message_471449">So, a quick follow up on some comments I made yesterday:<br>
<br>
1) With my current gear + usual buffs, the average damage dealt by a sinister strike is 1557 (premitigation).  The average damage done by a 2-point evis would be 1216.  So yes, the SS does more.<br>
<br>
However, SS costs 40 energy and a two-point Evis only 25 (with Relentless Strikes); hence the energy efficiency of the SS is only 38.9 damage per energy, while the evis does 48.6 damage per energy; hence the evis converts energy to damage more efficiently, and is thus potentially worth using in a cycle.<br>
<br>
2) As an example of itemization that makes 5s5r superior to the minimum cut cycle, consider the following gear setup:<br>
<br>
Cursed Vision of Sargeras (RED, Glinting Pyrestone)<br>
Choker of Endless Nightmare<br>
Slayer's Shoulderpads (Glinting Pyrestone/Shifting Shadowsong Amethyst)<br>
Shadowmoon Destoyer's Drape<br>
Slayer's Chestguard (Glinting Pyrestone x2, Shifting Shadowsong Amethyst)<br>
Insidious Bands (Glinting Pyrestone)<br>
Slayers' Handguards (Delicate Crimson Spinel)<br>
Don Alejandro's Money Belt (Delicate Crimson Spinel/Glinting Pyrestone)<br>
Slayer's Legguards (Delicate Crimson Spinel)<br>
Shadowmaster's Boots (Delicate Crimson Spinel/Glinting Pyrestone)<br>
Stormrage Signet Ring (Striking enchant)<br>
Ring of Deceitful Intent (Striking enchant)<br>
Madness of the Betrayer<br>
Dragonspine Trophy<br>
Warglaive of Azzinoth<br>
Warglaive of Azzinoth<br>
Twisted Blades of Zarak<br>
<br>
Now, with the buffs set to the default with which the sheet is uploaded, the recommended cycle is 3.2s5r, as usual - so the energy regen is sufficient to support such a thing.  However, if you click off Mangle, the cycle recommendation switches to 5s5r, despite the fact that 3.2s5r is sustainable.  This is because the gain in energy spent on Sinister Strike is sufficient to offset the loss of rupture damage.<br>
<br>
Now, admittedly, this does require a high level of itemization (that gear setup yields an average 41.3% crit rate, 3660 AP, and 630 armor penetration - note that those are time-averaged raid-buffed stats, and not base stats), and some questionable socketing decisions (using Agi over Hit in a number of slots) - but it can happen.</div>

		<div id="post_message_471632">I've been following these forums for a good while, but this is my first time posting.<br>
<br>
I took a break from BC for about 5 months and came back a few weeks ago, at which point I dove into engineering and leatherworking in an attempt to catch my dps up to my guildies (via the eng helm and primalstrike set). I've also been grabbing stuff out of Karazhan as we put Gruul on farm, and will get T4 2pc and DST soon, drops permitting.<br>
<br>
Given my gear level, my AP is somewhat high (over 1800) and my crit rating is just over 30%, but my hit rating is 186. I'm not trying to shoot for big crit numbers or to have the highest AP in my guild, it's just that every recommendation by the spreadsheet devalues hit rating for me. As an example, I was recently evaluating how to gem Skulker's Greaves, and triple +8 agi came out ahead of all other rare gems (especially raid-buffed). My question is: should I try to reach the hit cap first, regardless, and only then look at potential upgrades through other stats? Is being hit capped so much less important for a dagger rogue compared to a sword rogue that it's okay for me to be this low?<br>
<br>
I'd like to emphasize that I don't mean for this to be a question about what gear to get, since I clearly have many required upgrades and many of those will increase my hit rating.<br>
<br>
I've also thought about many of the fights my guild is currently doing. Almost none of them allow for uninterrupted dps, which seems to make hit rating even less useful since a larger proportion of my damage is coming from backstabs (which benefit from AP and crit, but not hit rating, at least above an easily-reached threshold).<br>
<br>
I'm probably just missing something obvious. Thanks in advance guys.</div>

</div>In general Hit Rating is very important though other stats can be better.  Hit rating is less important with certain gear sets.  For example when you don't have any procs from trinket or meta gems hit becomes less valuable than if you had such procs.  <br>
<br>
One thing to keep in mind is that there is nothing special about being hit capped.  The reason that is is mentioned as so important is that hit rating is almost always the best stat point per point and so if that is the case for you then you should push towards that.  <br>
<br>
A good example of how stacking hit rating is not always the best thing to do is if you look at t5 vs t4 you will see alot less hit rating on t5.  T5 is still better due to all the other stats it has on it.</div>

In a 1s/5r cycle, the rupture is free but the SnD costs, on average, 20 energy.  Hence, only about 90% of your energy regen is going to sinister strikes.<br>

Hence, with 1s/5r, you are actually launching about 10% fewer Sinister Strikes per unit time than with a 5s/5r cycle.  At most reasonable levels of itemization, the is outweighed by the 50% increase is Rupture uptime.</div>

</div>Fundamentally, what makes +hit powerful is that rogues gain a lot of DPS from proc effects, and effects can't proc if you're not hitting.  This is why sword rogues benefit from it more strongly than dagger rogues: because sword spec is a proc, while dagger spec is not.<br>
<br>
Moreover, in your particular case, you don't yet have many of the other important procs that rogues benefit from (Dragonspine Trophy and 2x Mongoose enchants, for instance).  This further depressed the value of hit.  Additionally, your OH is a bit slower than those used by most dagger rogues, which reduces the effect of combat potency somewhat as well.<br>
<br>
Finally, the damage output of pre-Kara weapons like you are using lowers the raw weapon damage that you are putting out, which thus lowers the value of hit even further.<br>
<br>
All in all: while I am a bit surprised the extent to which hit rating is discriminated against by your current gear, looking through your gear/spec, I can sort of see where it's coming from; I would expect that as your gear improves, you will see the value of hit increase.<br>

</div>For weapon skill under 355, this sheet is not accurate.  For weapon skill 355 and over, it should be... reasonably accurate.  I can't say totally accurate since I don't think the full effect of weapon skill is actually known at this point.  But it's as accurate as I know how to make it.<br>
<br>
Now, if weapon expertise isn't changing OH damage at *all*, that's probably a bug.  If it's changing it, but not by very much, that's probably correct.<br>
<br>
Regarding differences between the two sheets: assuming a) I have the proc rate on both correct (which I'm reasonably confident allbeit not certain that I do and b) Dragonstrike is not given an internal cooldown next patch (and it wouldn't surprise me in the least if it was), I believe that this sheet is correct.  Now, admittedly, I'm likely somewhat biased in this (being the author and all) but as a general rule I do think this sheet does a better job of encoporating all the subtleties of the unusual proc effects that show up, such as Rod of the Sun King.<br>

</div>Yes, but the scaling in question isn't related to energy regen increasing; in practice, energy regen caps out under 14 energy per second, meaning that a 5s5r cycle will never have more than 65% or so rupture uptime.  The scaling effect in question is that a) crit and armor penetration increase the damage of sinister strike but not rupture, and b) assuming reasonable crit and armor penetration, sinister strike scales more quickly with AP than does rupture.  So, if your crit, AP, and armor pen get high enough, you can get to a point where the extra SS are worth more than the extra rupture uptime.</div>

</div>I've always been of the opinion that T4 set bonuses are somewhat uninspiring as a sword rogue.  As a dagger rogue, they certainly have their place.  But as a sword rogue, I just don't find the benefit to be that big.  This is (among other reasons) why I never got more than 1 piece of T4.<br>
<br>
Looking at your gear setup for a moment:<br>
*Your helm is significant better than T4<br>
*Your legs are already somewhat better than T4.<br>
*T4 gloves are mind-blowingly bad, particularly when compared to T5 gloves.<br>
*If your guild is anything like mine, T5 shoulders will drop in price at a decent rate, as VR is a total farm job.<br>
<br>
So I don't see that there's a lot of T4 you'd want to wear very long.  It depends, of course, on how large an intermediate damage drop you're talking about and for how long you expect it to last.  But my philosophy on T4 was that there wasn't anything compelling enough in T4 to warrant significant DKP expendature on it, such that I only picked up those items that I could get cheaply.  Rather, I kept using my Karazhan loot + 2/5 WW until I could pick up T5 and T5-equivalent (i.e. Bloodsea Brigand's Vest, etc.) loot.  But, doing it the other way works too; just a matter of personal preference.</div>

</div>I've already got the T5 shoulders, just haven't been wearing them yet because of the hit I take from losing the 2pc NB bonus (moving to deathmantle shoulders is something along the lines of <br>
11DPS lost, depending on how I happen to gem them.<br>
<br>
Again, I'm really unsure about which piece of T4 to take to continue the bonus. T4 legs would let me maintain my 2pc bonus with gloves, for now, while only costing me something along the lines of 150g to add a cobrascale armor kit to, while using the 2pc shoulders, especially as there's probably a few shamans and another rogue ahead of me on the gloves for now. I really, really do not want to lock myself into the chestpiece instead of the Bloodsea Brigand's though.<br>
<br>
Since T5 legs already kinda suck, and as you mention, my current legs are "somewhat" better than T4, I sort of feel like it would be worth the bid, especially as they're *almost* on "side-spec/burn" status at present.</div>

About the OH/Weapon skill issue: I think there's no such bug, just a wierd way of compairing weapons. I think the sheet is compairing each weapon without taking into account weapon expertise(BUT taking into account weapon spec, INCLUDING mace spec which gives weapon skill, which means the sheet is using weapon skill but just not weapon expertise?). <br>
When you equip the shiv and "respec" to 2/2 weapon expertise you get a nice dps increase, but if you have the Mace on the offhand, the sheet considers the shiv an upgrade by the same amount with OR without 2/2 weapon expertise(which should improve the shiv but not the S2 OH mace)<br>
<br>
*Edit: Again on the weapon expertise issue on offhand weapons. If I add sword/dagger/fist spec to my talent build(in addition to mace spec), the sheet starts to suggest me to switch to the S2 OH fist or sword, as expected. With 5/5 mace spec and 5/5 sword spec the sheet suggests switching from S2 OH Mace to S2 OH Sword by a big margin(141ap) or S1 OH by 101dps<br>
Now, if instead of going swords I go fists I get the same result, but by a much smaller margin(50dps), again, as expected. In this case the S1 OH Fist doesnt even appear on the suggestion frame and is replaced by S2 OH Dagger(the shiv, from now) which would give me a 30.43ap increase. Fist spec is not good enough to compensate the .1 weapon speed decrease the shiv offers. Fine, I understand<br>
Now, for the wierd thing: IF, while being 5/5 mace spec and 5/5 fist spec, I ADD 5/5 dagger spec(I know, not possible on a real build, but bear with me!) the fists dissapear from the suggestion frame and only the S2 Shiv appears, giving the SAME exact ap increase(30.43) it gave me without 5/5 dagger spec. The only other suggestion is my current oh mace, with a 0 ap increase. Below it: N/A<br>
To narrow things down a bit, I respecced out of fist spec, leaving only mace and dagger spec. The only change is that now, the third suggestion changes from N/A to the S1 Shiv(-2.86ap)<br>
And the last test:removing dagger spec and leaving my build with just 5/5 mace spec(the current situation on my real character) changes the suggestion frame to the situation at mace&amp;fist&amp;dagger spec: 30.43ap increase from the shiv, 0dps from the s2 oh mace[current weapon] and N/A<br>
<br>
If I equip the shiv and respec to dagger&amp;mace spec, I get a dps increase, which means that the only issue is on the suggestion column</div>

</div>10DPS with equal gems moving from Netherblade Shoulderpads to Deathmantle Shoulderpads.<br>
<br>
With gloves too, I still lose 1.36 DPS (per the DPS spreadsheet, haven't run it through this one yet).<br>
<br>
So the only thing that would make it worthwhile to drop the whole Netherblade ideal would be grabbing the Bloodsea Brigand's vest, bringing it to a net upgrade of 6.04DPS, while, even then, NB shoulderpads and legs would be 13.43DPS higher, with 9.43DPS upgrade with gloves/leggings and the bloodsea brigand's vest.<br>
<br>
Is it a phenomenal bonus? No. But it's damn hard to get rid of at my current progression level since it's, essentially, free, and deathmantle leggings are still kinda crap.</div>

		<div id="post_message_472560">So, I've been working on some ideas regarding Mutilate, and there are a few questions I need answered before I can move forward.  So if those of you with some experience in the matter would care to assist, I would be greatful.<br>
<br>
1) If one of the two attacks of a Mutilate misses or is dodged, do you still gain 2 combo points?<br>
2) If both attacks miss/are dodged, do you gain combo points?  Is the energy for the attack (mostly) refunded, as is true for backstab/sinister strike/hemo?<br>
3) Is anyone aware of viable cycle propositions for Mutilate other than 4+ CPs with intelligent finisher selection?<br>
<br>
Just so we're clear: I probably will not be integrating Mutilate into the main sheet; rather, I am currently thinking I will make a similar Mutilate sheet with roughly the same frontpage UI, that will only do computations for Mutilate builds.  I will also probably not be updating it as faithfully as I do this one, but I do want to have at least a rough version of the spreadsheet so comparisons can be made.</div>

</div>With Ruthlessness and only one crit Mutilate, you can get 4 combo points a significant amount of the time. This complicates finding a cycle the most. I think intelligent finisher selection is indeed the best option, following these priorities:<br>
- Slice and Dice whenever it's down, save up energy if it runs out in a couple seconds;<br>
- Rupture whenever it's down, save up energy if it runs out in a couple seconds;<br>
- Envenom if you have enough Deadly Poison stacked to get the full benefit, Eviscerate otherwise.<br>
<br>
You'll want to wait for energy to get back-to-back Ruptures and to fit two Mutilates in the Find Weakness uptime (10 seconds, so only 100 energy regen). One generally only gets to use Envenom/Eviscerate after a Ruthlessness proc + crit Mutilate. Depending on gear it might be a better idea to just Mutilate a second time instead of dumping combo points in those finishers. I have two pieces T4 and two pieces T5, so I try to stick to 4-5s,4-5r,(4e),4-5r as much as possible. It might be worth calculating a shorter cycle 1-3s,4-5r.<br>

It takes your raw stats, allows buff and talent selection and some basic options like whether to keep up Find Weakness, whether the mob is poison immune, and the like. I'm looking into adding at least a basic Armory import for raw stats and maybe implement some trinkets before calling the simulator fit for consumption.

<br>
4combo point rule is a good one.  Keep SnD up always, envenom when at 4-5 combo points and 5 deadly stacks AND you have a enhance shaman to steal stormstrike from and preferably 2piece t5(massive huge 4800+ envenoms possible).  Rupture when you dont have max stacks of deadly.  The occasion is rare when you dont need to snd or rupture and can't envenom..but if it does happen, evic might be applicable but I never really tried to figure out if that's efficient or not.  I did that with a 1.6 speed offhand.  Find weakness is super important, if I needed to do a 3point to keep it up I'd try to make it be a SnD rather than a rupture/envenom.<br>
<br>
I have absolutely zero mathematical evidence to support the above, just a lot of raid practice and testing.  The above maximized what I was able to do.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_473349"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->The effective damage of Envenom is the amount you see flashing by on your screen, minus the opportunity cost of having to refresh Deadly Poison. In a formula:<br>
<br>
Envenom = Vile Poisons * Rank * (180 + 0.03 * AP - 15 * RefreshTime), where<br>
Vile Poisons = 1 to 1.2 depending on talents;<br>
Rank = the number of combo points or deadly poison doses, whichever is lower;<br>
AP = your attack power;<br>
RefreshTime = MutilateTime / (1 + MutilateTime / OffSpeed) / Improved Poisons, where<br>
MutilateTime = average time in seconds between Mutilates<br>
OffSpeed = the attack time of your offhand weapon<br>
Improved Poisons = 0.3 to 0.4 depending on talents.<br>
<br>
For example, with 3000 AP and Tracker's Blade (1.5 speed) in offhand, using 5-point Envenom assuming Mutilate every 6 seconds:<br>
<br>
RefreshTime = 6 / (1 + 6 / 1.5) / 0.4 = 3 seconds<br>
1.2 * 5 * (180 + 0.03 * 3000 - 15 * 3) = 1350 damage non-crit.<br>
<br>
A 5-point Eviscerate would deal 1045 + 0.15 * 3000 = 1495 damage, modified by armor (897?). If you had only three Deadly Poison stacked, Envenom would deal 810 effective damage. So you see, there may be situations where the one is better than the other. Whether that situation occurs often or not is another matter.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Mutilate is the most unpredictable build there is, i dont think there is a real "rotation" to it. Its simply a game of keeping SnD up, Find Weakness up, and Rupture up as much as possible while throwing in Envenoms where you see fit.<br>
<br>
By my calculations rupture is always better then envenom due to energy cost mostly.<br>

Is downloading the procwatch mod sufficient in testing the trinket on the blasted lands mob?  How should I go about attacking it.  Just auto attack?<br>
<br>
actually the procwatch mods I can find on curse dont seem to have a minimum time between procs so dont think they'd be usefull for this.  Not sure how to test it then.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_474773"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->So, when researching an unknown proc, it's usually best to do it with a single weapon or with two weapons of the same speed.  However, since we already know a bit about how Tsunami Talisman works, it's probably okay to use and two weapons you want, and to use all the combo-point generating moves you want.  However, I'm a little iffy on how finishers work with procs, so I'd hold off on using any.<br>
<br>
As for how to actually analyze data: easiest way is probably to just take a /combatlog of your test and post it to savefile (or wherever), at which point I'll grab it and run my analysis programs over it.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Aye, you should only use Envenom as the last finisher of a fight.  Thing is, that's much much more than most people seem to think.  The vast majority of trash fights go:<br>
<br>
Garotte, Shiv, S'n'D, SS to 5 points, Envenom, move to next mob.<br>
<br>
Using Shiv at the start there to build the DP stack while letting the tank get an aggro head start.<br>
<br>
On tougher trash there might be time for a few CP of Rupture in the middle.  But for anything other than boss fights, I'd say Envenom can and should make up 33 - 50% of all your finishers.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

That's five instances where the buff lasts longer than 10 seconds.  There may be others which I didn't catch by eye.  Unless you had multiple lagspikes of more than 5 seconds' duration, I think it's safe to say that the proc can refresh itself.  That means that any internal cooldown is less than the duration of the proc itself and is unlikely to be significant.<br>

		<div id="post_message_475462"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Analysis of the dragonstrike log:<br>
<br>
44 uptime periods, including 5 periods 15 seconds or longer, the longest being the 29 sec uptime at 15:22:52.656.  Hence, at least 50 procs actually occurred, and there is no internal cooldown.<br>
<br>
There were 1272 total swings; the proc rate (assuming 50 procs) thus lies between 2.86% and 5.00%, which equates to being between .64 and 1.11 PPM.  Note that this does not take into account the new findings regarding reduction of proc rate with haste effects.<br>
<br>
On the whole: still seems to be the same proc as on live.<br>
<br>
Regarding hit: when single-wielding, the amount of hit required to never miss a Servant is extremely low.  There are some uncertainties in the exact formula, but it is certainly true that 4% hit will be sufficient, and there's a good chance you don't actually need any at all.<br>
<br>
Regarding internal cooldowns: Typically they're measured from start of proc to start of proc.  The fact that you had refreshing procs indicates that if an internal cooldown exists, it is 5 seconds or less.  Since we have no evidence of internal cooldowns shorter than the length of the proc existing, it is therefore generally assumed that this means there is, in fact, no internal cooldown.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_476659">It's not going to affect real DPS, as no mechanics change is actually being made.  However, the spreadsheet models are going to need to be updated, which will change the relative value of certain stats and abilities.<br>
<br>
Of note, the valuations in this spreadsheet will be affected in the following ways:<br>
<br>
1)The power of all PPM effects will go down somewhat, including, notably: Dragonspine Trophy and Mongoose enchant (along with Madness of the Betrayer, BS maces, The Bladefist, Rod of the Sun King, etc.)<br>
<br>
2) The value of haste rating will drop somewhat.  Currently, the model is that haste rating increases both direct damage done, and also increases proc time which will increase damage further.  With this change, haste rating will still increase the direct damage done but will *decrease* proc uptime, which will yield a smaller damage return.<br>
<br>
In terms of actual in-game effects: I think the only difference is that if you're not using any flat +AP activated trinkets, it is now understood to be optimal to use AR separately from activated haste buffs (Blade Flurry, Heroism, Haste Pots, etc.) rather than at the same time.

		<div id="post_message_476735">I don't think you can say that haste rating will decrease proc uptime. I've been following that thread pretty closely myself, and I haven't seen any solid testing done on special attacks yet to indicate that they might suffer the same proc rate adjustment that white attacks do during haste effects. Hell, I'm not even 100% convinced yet that proc rates adjust with haste effects. There are still conflicting results and it's a bit early to conclude anything.<br>
<br>
As far as how much it would affect our models if this turned out to be true -- well, in the case of DST, not actually very much. Using a model I cooked up in a spreadsheet of my own with my gear as the basis, DST uptime comes out to 27.85% if hastes increase PPM, and 23.43% if hastes don't increase PPM. Note that this assumes the 20-second internal cooldown from the upcoming patch.<br>
<br>
The first number is calculated using the same method as your spreadsheet, by figuring a number of procs per second from the total number of attacks per second, then taking (Duration*PPS)/(Cooldown*PPS + 1). The second number was calculated by modifying the procs-per-second formula:<br>
<br>
((1 - MHMiss - MHDodge) + (1 - OHMiss - OHDodge) + (1 - SPMiss - SPDodge) * MHSpeed / SPSpeed) / 60<br>
<br>
This assumes DST is 1 PPM, regardless of the speed of your attacks. Thus, you get 1 PPM from your main hand times the fraction of MH attacks that actually land, plus the same from your offhand. Finally, from special attacks that land, you get 1 PPM times the ratio of main hand [base] speed to special attack speed (for this you need to know approximately how often, in seconds, you perform specials). Then divide by 60 to get procs-per-second.<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
If it weren't for the internal cooldown, the effect would be larger, I suppose. I repeated the same calculation for Mongoose (in the middle of typing up this post) and the main hand's Mongoose uptime was reduced from 46% to 25%. The loss of agility is approximately 25.<br>
<br>
(edit) Oops, screwed up that Mongoose calc. It actually went down to 35%, with a drop of about 13 agility. Still rough when combined with the effect on the OH. Still, if that thread is to be believed, it's not like these are nerfs going in...we've just been modeling it wrong all along.<br>
<br>
(edit 2) Perhaps I've royally screwed something up, but it really doesn't look like the effect is that big. After completely redoing the calculations in my spreadsheet, my DPS decreased from 1415.02 to 1397.02 (a difference of 18).</div>

</div>I, on the other hand, feel like it would make more sense that the proc rate on instant attacks <i>weren't</i> modified by haste procs. However, that's what experimentation is for. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080207121104im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/wink.gif" border="0" alt="" title=";)" class="inlineimg"><br>
<br>
In the meantime, what I can do is to compare the two models and see what the difference really is. So I've been heavily refining my spreadsheet over the course of the day to bring it in line with the theory that haste does not change the effective PPM of a PPM-based proc. After all my modifications, I equip a Dragonspine Trophy in place of my Bloodlust Brooch (in reality, I don't have a DST, but this is just for the sake of argument). My DPS is given as 1362.45.<br>
<br>
Now, I modify the spreadsheet to assume that special attacks suffer a penalty to their proc rate on PPM enchants while under the influence of haste effects. I check my DPS again. It is down to 1357.14.<br>
<br>
For the sake of argument, I now equip a Shadow-Walker's Cord in place of Socrethar's Girdle. My DPS now increases to 1375.64 (if special attacks aren't penalized, it's 1381.06). Then I swap in a Belt of One-Hundred Deaths and it increases to 1376.83 (1381.64). Belt of Deep Shadow makes it 1376.42 (1381.23).<br>
<br>
In the end, I don't think there's actually that much of a difference whether you model it with special attacks getting penalized or not. Obviously we want to be as accurate as possible with our models, so it will be nice to know for sure, but all in all the total error is not that major.</div>

		<div id="post_message_476933">I agree that it doesn't make a whole heck of a lot of difference in terms of DPS; however, even small net changes in DPS can have significant effects on stat weighting.  Consider, for example, the discussion I give of inaccuracies of the original rogue spreadsheet in post 619.  The basis of my argument was that in practice one had 210 more available energy than the sheet was modeling for over the course of a 7 minute fight.<br>
<br>
Now, in terms of actual DPS, 210 energy is 3.5 backstabs, so maybe 4k total damage.  Which, over a 7 minute fight, is under 10 DPS - barely over 1%, and not a big deal.  So in terms of estimating your actual damage output, it was fine.<br>
<br>
However, consider the effect on the value of, say, a talent point in lethality under this change.  Since Lethality only affects your yellow damage, the amount of damage you get from a point in Lethality increases by 5% when you move from the spreadsheet model to the real scenario.  Meanwhile, a talent point in, say, precision, still yields exactly the same amount of damage either way, while the value of a talent point in, say, murder, is going to increase by about 2%.  So even though ones overall damage changed by barely 1%, the relative value of stats can easily change by up to 5% in this example.  Now, admittedly, 5% still isn't a *lot*, but when you consider that, for instance, the value of agi and hit will be within 10% of each other after the Dragonspine nerf, suddenly changes on the order of 5% look like they could really change what your optimal gear is, even if they don't directly affect your damage that much.<br>
<br>
I admit this is to some extent splitting hairs, but I do think it's important to note that even reasonably small differences in damage can signify larger changes in equipment selection.</div>

		<div id="post_message_476947">Doesn't it matter very little?  Even if instants aren't affected by the normalization...doesn't that only significantly change items like say.....warp-spring coil(even then it shouldn't)?  If an item has an internal cooldown and a PPM the few extra instant attacks in the midst of all the auto attacks shouldn't hold that large a part of whether a PPM procs faster or slower.  I guess maybe something like a heroic strike could be affected...but a sinister strike has nothing to do with haste rating other than combat potency procs.<br>

		<div id="post_message_476966">Well, it's not a huge difference, but again, it matters some.  Lets take a look at MH Mongoose as an example.<br>
<br>
Lets assume we're using Talon of Azshara, and are gaining enough energy for a Sinister Strike every 3 seconds (in practice, it takes a bit longer than that, but, as a ballpark figure, it'll work).  Based on the way the normalization works, regardless of haste level, the autoattacks will generate 1 proc per minute.  Now, if instant attacks are *not* affected by Haste, we will have 20 SS per minute, each of which has a 2.7/60 = 4.5% chance to proc, so we gain an extra .9 procs per minute from instant attacks, for a total of 1.9 PPM.<br>
<br>
If, on the other hand, we have, say, 35% haste (which is trivial to get to, particularly with 2/5 T6), our Talon is now effectively speed 2.0, so the proc chance goes down to 2.0/6.0 = 3.33% chance; hence the 20 sinister strikes per minute only generate an additional .667 procs, for a total of 1.667 main hand mongoose procs.<br>
<br>
So, it's a difference of about 14% in the number of MH procs, which equates to an uptime difference of about 11%.  Hence, there's an 11% difference (or so) in the damage contribution of Mongoose - that strikes me as relatively significant.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Mojo: There was some discussion on the weapon skill adjustment thing about the actual value of weapon skill, whether or not it scaled linearly, etc. Should I just take it at face value and say "It will be at least the DPS noted in the sheet" and deal with it?</div>

</div>The effekt of +skill on hit/miss is nailed down.<br>
+skill lowers the basemisschance for mobs. In a sense you can say it will provde hit because those are complementary.<br>
If you figet a boss (or lvl73 mob):<br>
- It is linear for skills from 350 to 354 and from 355 on, but with different slopes<br>
- There is a pronounced jump when going from 354 skill to 355 skill.<br>
(The change of slope happens if the difference of Mobdefense and your weapon skill is &gt;10. <br>
So +skill is not a big deal if you only fight mobs between your level and up to two levels higher.<br>
But as soon as you hit bosses you get a 3% decrease in miss <b> if you have +5skill or more</b>)<br>
<br>
And  of the converted skillrating only whole numbers are used: <br>
INT( (rating1+rating2+rating3+....) * 52/203 )<br>
Eg. +15 skillrating nets you ony +3 skill instead of the converted 3.8.<br>
<br>
For the details look at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080207121104/http://elitistjerks.com/472228-post533.html" target="_blank">http://elitistjerks.com/472228-post533.html</a> and the whole thread there.<br>
<br>
For total weapon skill of 355 or more the spreadsheet does provide the correct answer,<br>
but expressd as gaining +hit instead of lowering basemiss. Does not matter in the end.</div>

		<div id="post_message_477602"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Regarding weapon skill: <br>
<br>
Assuming you have at least 355 weapon skill, the sheet should be reasonably accurate.  Since the effect of weapon skill on dodge isn't totally pinned down yet, I can't say for sure whether they're totally accurate.  But they should be relatively close.<br>
<br>
I've been debating with myself whether to update the model to give correct damage numbers under 355 skill.  On the one hand, this would give a more accurate damage number; on the other hand, the nonlinearities would cause some inaccuracies in the gear-comparison.  Is there a concensus regarding whether people would rather see the dps number more accurate, or the gear comarisons/recommendations more accurate?<br>
<br>
Regarding AP/Crit summary:<br>
<br>
Yes, I'd like to add such a thing (and probably an HP/Dodge summary as well); I haven't yet decided whether this should be the time-averaged buff stats used in the damage calculations, or the base stats as they would appear on your character sheet.  I can see value in both.<br>
<br>
The ultimate goal is to compress all useful information onto as few sheets as possible.  I would eventually like to see the information on the buffs sheet and the set bonus sheet displayed somewhere on the front page, such that there would be only two pages that one would ever need to look at (Talents_Equipment and Advanced Settings).  And on those pages it would have all adjustable parameters (gear/talents/buffs), stat summaries, gear comparisons, next-stat values, the works.  The trick is figuring out where to put everything, as the front page is already quite full.  Again, if people have suggestions, let me know.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>1) Absolutely, on mobs that are affected by Murder. In places like SSC/TK, where mobs of the mobs are affected, it's a great talent.<br>
<br>
2) Not really, it all depends on the type of mob being attacked. In Hyjal/BT, Murder becomes less valuable because of the lack of vulnerable mobs.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

	</td></tr><tr><td>755</td><td>◊ Aldriana</td><td>
	
	
		
		
		<!-- message -->
		<div id="post_message_477796"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->So, first off: the sheet assumes that all mobs are murderable, which, while certainly true of many mobs in SSC and TK, it is not true of all of them; notably, Hydross, Void Reaver, and Al'ar are excluded.  Additionally, Vashj and Kael both have adds that are not effected by murder.  So Murder isn't quite 100% universal even in SSC and TK.  Once one moves *past* SSC/TK, the value of Murder drops somewhat; not a single enemy in Hyjal is murderable, and only about half of BT is.<br>
<br>
That said: on the mobs that murder effects, it is point-for-point a pretty strong talent.<br>
<br>
Running the actual numbers versus Lethality:<br>
<br>
Murder increases your total damage output - white, yellow, poison, everything - by 1% per point.  Lethality only increases the damage you do with yellow attacks.  Yellow attacks typically comprise about 1/3 of ones damage; hence, in order for Lethality to match the contribution of Murder (on those mobs affected by both), a point of Lethality would need to increase your yellow damage by about 3%.<br>
<br>
Lethality, mechanically speaking, increases the damage done by your critical strikes by 3% (the first point takes them from 200 -&gt; 206%, a 3% increase).  Hence, if the total damage done by both crits and noncrits is going to increase by 3%, all yellow attacks must crit.  Hence, in order for Lethality to point-for-point compete with Murder on those mobs which are affected, one would basically need to have a 100% crit rate; even with improved backstab that would require a tooltip crit rate of 70%, which isn't really feasible.<br>
<br>
Now, that said, *since* not all mobs are affected by Murder, Lethality doesn't necessarily need to do as much damage against those that are Murderable in order to be worthwhile.  In particular, if one assumes that, say, 2/3 of mobs are Murderable (which is probably a fair assessment of bosses in SSC/TK), then only ~67% of yellow hits need to be crits in order for Lethality to yield the same average damage output - and a 37% crit rate is not out of the range of possibility for a raid-buffed dagger rogue.  So I think there is a legitimate case to be made for Lethality even though Murder does do more damage on the mobs it affects.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<!-- message -->
		<div id="post_message_477812"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->The big difference lies in the fact that Murder applies to all damage, whereas Lethality only applies to crits on specials.<br>
<br>
Suppose that without points in either talent, you do 100 DPS.<br>
<br>
Getting Murder would take you to 102 DPS, that's pretty easy to see.<br>
<br>
Let's look at the best case for Lethality.  If you had 100% to crit with backstab, 2 points in lethality would increase backstab damage by 6% (all BS's are crits, and they change from 200% to 212%).  The increase to your total output then depends on how much of your damage came from crit backstabs before you invested the talent points.  If backstab crits were accounting for more than 1/3 of your damage, lethality would be better than murder.<br>
<br>
I haven't been daggers for a little while, so I don't remember the breakdown, but I want to say that my backstab % was in the high 20's/low 30's, white damage high 50's/low 60's, and the rest rupture/poison/etc.  "Low 30's? Great! Lethality rocks! Right?"  No.  I didn't have 100% to crit, so the portion represented by backstab crits was even smaller, and I had 4/5 lethality already.  It's not like I could add 6% to my backstab output by investing more points.<br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong.  I had lethality and ruthlessness, and no murder, because they worked on all targets equally, but lethality is not a particularly strong talent point for point.  It does increase damage, but not as well as many other talents.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">As a quick update: I hacked up some estimates of assuming<br>
<br>
a) Haste Nerf<br>
b) Dragonspine Nerf<br>
c) New findings on Haste/PPM.<br>
<br>
Findings are pretty interesting; for one, agility does indeed pass hit in terms of total utility per point (at least, by weighted total if not by actual damage output - hit still has the damage edge).<br>
<br>
Additionally, the ranking of the endgame trinkets is as follows:<br>
<br>
1) Dragonspine - 209<br>
2) Ashtongue - 173<br>
3) WSC - 172<br>
4) Madness - 167<br>
5) Tsunami - 157<br>
<br>
So Dragonspine is still the best.  It's just not quite as mandatory as it once was.</div>

		<div id="post_message_478023"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Hit still provides point-for-point more damage than agility in purely sustained fights.  However, in terms of weighted average (which includes a slight value for the dodge gained from agility), Agility scores a bit above hit.<br>
<br>
Additionally, agility performs better relative to hit in interrupted fights; as such, while hit may be better in purely sustained fights, in real fights where their are damage interruptions (which includes, for instance, better than half of the 25-man raid bosses in existance), agility may be the better choice (I'm working on a model of this behavior, but haven't come up with one I'm wholly happy with.)<br>
<br>
Finally, those numbers were based off the best possible gear setup - the target endgame gear.  Until one gets there, the relative values of the different trinkets may be difference.  For instance, in my *current* gear (as opposed to the endgame optimal gear), hit is still better than agility, and the trinket ordering is rather different: <br>
<br>
1) Dragonspine - 198<br>
2) Ashtongue - 180<br>
3) Madness - 165<br>
4) WSC - 155<br>
5) TT - 151<br>
<br>
In practice, I suspect practical considerations will outweigh the exact subtleties, specifically:<br>
a) By the time one can get Madness, one is probably close to/already has Ashtongue, which is comparable or better.  So you probably don't bother with Madness.<br>
<br>
b) At the time you have access to them, while WSC is slightly better than TT, they are fairly comparable, so I would advocate the WDF (Whatever Drops First) or WDFAIC (...And Is Cheap) algorithm for deciding which to get.<br>
<br>
c) Amongst BT gems, red gems tend to be more popular than orange gems, and the yellow +hit gem doesn't exist.  So in practice, even if agi is marginally superior to hit, it doesn't matter enough that I'd worry about wrestling Crimson Spinels away from the casters and hunters; hence, regardless of the specifics, you probably wind up socketing everything with Glinting Pyrestones.<br>
<br>
d) Pre-BT, hit is still better, so keep doing what you've been doing.<br>
<br>
Regarding the interplay of DST and Hit, specifically: it was one of the very first discoveries of this sheet that DST dramatically increased the value of hit.  The more general rule is "having powerful procs increases the value of hit".  The reason why hit is king for rogues these days is the fact that we have so many procs: Combat Potency, Poison, Mongoose, DST, Windfury, Sword Spec, etc.  So if you don't have DST (or Mongoose, or Combat Potency, or Windfury, or whatever), the value of hit is going to drop relative to a rogue that does.  The reason why the value of hit is decreasing relative to previous versions of the sheet is based off the new findings regarding PPM effects and haste, plus the fact that DST is a less powerful proc due to the haste nerf and the internal cooldown.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

And, certainly, one will need to socket 2-Tier 6 level pieces with yellow/blue gems to get the socket bonus (most likely shoulders + chest).  But anywhere where you don't need the socket bonus, and in any red socket, one can make a case for using Delicate Crimson Spinels.  I believe my endgame optimal gear, neglecting considerations of gem scarcity, involves 4 Delicate Crimson Spinel (one each in T6 gloves, T6 legs, Don Alejandro's Money Belt, and Shadowmaster's Boots).<br>

However, as I say, in practice, you probably end up gemming even those 4 with Glinting Pyrestones, because the difference is so small that your guild probably benefits more by leaving the Crimson Spinels to the casters + hunters.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I think with the advent of different dmgreduction effects and the nonlinearity<br>
of the reduction formula the extra computation for WSC-reduction should go away.<br>

</div>The extra step is done precisely because armor penetration is nonlinear; WSC is modeled as a 1000 armor reduction that's up, say, 25% of the time, rather than a 250 armor reduction that's up 100% of the time, as that more accurately reflects reality.  In truth, Madness of the Betrayer would be more accurately modeled as 300 penetration that's up ~50% of the time rather than ~150 armor penetration.  I do not do so for two reasons:<br>
<br>
a) This becomes a very messy calculation in very short order if you compute every armor penetration proc seperately, and<br>
b) As it's a smaller armor decrease, the nonlinearity has less of an effect.<br>
<br>
Yes, all of them actually have the same effect - they reduce armor.  And the sheet models them all the same way - they reduce armor.<br>

You're on hyjal trash, stuff dying really fast so rupture is basically impossible.    You have 3 combo points and 5-8 seconds left on snd and mob is about to die.  Do you evic or refresh snd?  I got nothing in imp evic and broke my 2 piece t5 recently for t6 gloves.  Generally speaking I've always done good consistant dps on trash...but mostly cause I'm obsessive about being 100% focused all the time.  When it comes to split second decisions like the one above, I just wing it.  Any thoughts on an efficient way to handle mid-range combo points in a quickly shifting target cycle?<br>

		<div id="post_message_478639"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->So, couple of things:<br>
<br>
1) I was doing some testing this evening on live, and as an incidental benefit of what I was *actually* testing, took some data on Tsunami Talisman.  Out of 59 total procs, the spacing never was under 46.281 seconds.  So the values on test would appear to not be changed - the spreadsheet was just using slightly wrong values.  I'll add it to the list of things to fix.<br>
<br>
2) What I was *actually* testing is the proc rate of 4/5 T5.  Offhand, the answer seems to be "about .5 PPM with no internal cooldown" - I'll need to take a larger data set at some point to confirm that, but that's my best guess at this stage.  If that is, in fact, true, that means that the spreadsheet is currently overvaluing that set bonus somewhat for sword rogues and by quite a bit for dagger rogues.  Again, added to the list, pending confirmation.<br>
<br>
3) Re: Trash DPS scenario.  I haven't actually run any numbers on this, so trust the following assertion only assuming you trust my gut instincts:<br>
<br>
As a general rule, you want to keep SnD up as much as humanly possible.  So if there are additional mobs to be killed on hand (i.e. if you're killing a pack of stuff and there's more stuff left in the pack), I typically refresh the SnD.  If, however, there's no further mobs in the pack (or the next DPS target is far away), I'll generally throw the Evis if it's 3 points or larger, *or* if I have energy for it but not a SS (i.e. my current energy is 35-39).<br>
<br>
Again, no real theory backing that, that's just my instinct.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_479649">Re: Shoulders.  Thanks<br>
<br>
Re: Belts.  Don Alejandro's and Belt of One-Hundred Deaths are extremely close in terms of rating by the spreadsheet (in the current version I'm using, which has about half of the changes for 0.7.8 in it, they score within .2 AP of each other assuming late-BT quality gearing).  So, ultimately, it's a matter of personal preference - subject to a couple of assumptions.<br>
<br>
First off, it should be noted that the exact behavior of weapon skill on dodge has not been finalized.  As such, it's entirely possible that the Vashj belt is under- (or over-) valued in the current incarnation of the sheet.  So when and if an answer is ultimately reached for that issue, the answer may change here.<br>
<br>
But, for the sake of argument, lets assume, for the moment, that Weapon Skill is modeled correctly.  At this point, the decision - for me at least - comes down to two things.  Interrupted combat, and rounding.<br>
<br>
1) Interrupted combat.  The sheet, as has been noted, assumes endless uninterrupted combat.  In practice, very few boss fights exhibit uninterrupted combat; for instance, in all of SSC/TK, there are really only two fights that have even the potential for uninterrupted sustained DPS:  Tidewalker (assuming no graves) and Void Reaver (depending on your strategy).  And, looking through Hyjal/BT, they're not really any better; you have Gorefiend, Bloodboil, Anetheron, Kaz'rogal... and that's about it.  Moreover, you'll note that many of *those* fights are fairly short, and thus are poorly modeled by "endless".  So when you add it all up, most fights shorter and/or more interrupted than the spreadsheet models.<br>
<br>
The question, then, is what effect this has an actual DPS.  Well, interrupted fights have a number of effects; the major one, of course, is that your cycles necessarily change.  Additionally, it increases the value of effects with cooldowns.  But the other fairly fundamental thing it does is that it change the ratio of white to yellow damage; whenever you're in a situation where your energy is regenerating but you're not autoattacking, you're going to do more yellow damage relative to the amount of white damage.  This will thus relatively decrease the value of hit, which only affects white damage; hence, between two otherwise comparable items, it is generally superior to wear the one that has less hit on it.<br>
<br>
With regards to the specific belt situation:<br>
<br>
Don Alejandro's has no inherent hit on it, so will gain only what it gets from gems - most likely 5 or 10 hit rating.<br>
<br>
Belt of One-Hundred Deaths has 25 weapons skill rating = 6 weapon skill = .6% hit = ~9.5 hit rating on it inherently, plus whatever additional you gain from socketing (which is almost certainly nonzero).  Additionally, some of it's benefit is also from -enemy dodge, which also helps white damage more than yellow.<br>
<br>
Hence, Belt of One-Hundred Deaths is more of a white-damage-friendly belt, while Don Alejandro's is more of a yellow-damage-friendly belt; hence, in interrupted scenarios, the advantage tends to go more toward Don Alejandro's.<br>
<br>
It might be noted, however, that Heroism - particularly multiple Heroisms per fight - can tip the balance more towards white damage, as can haste pots.  As such, there is a reasonable argument to be made for favoring white damage more than yellow.  And in case you were wondering, yes, I am planning to add "drink a haste pot every 2 minutes" and "give me N heroisms every 10 minutes" as options to the buff sheet at some point; I just haven't gotten around to it yet.<br>
<br>
So, to summarize this point: there is a reasonable case to be made that Don Alejandro's will perform somewhat better in interrupted-damage scenarios than Belt of One-Hundred Deaths.  The real answer here, of course, would be to have both belts and rotate depending on the fight.  But that's not always possible.<br>
<br>
2) Rounding.  For reasons of continuity, the sheet doesn't quantize to integers like the game does.  As such, for fine-level decisions like comparing these two belts, it may be worth considering your position relative to various roundoff cutoffs.  As an example: 25 weapon skill rating is modeled in the sheet as 6.34... weapon skill, when in reality, it's only 6.  As such, In terms of actual performance in real-world scenarios, the Vashj belt is overvalued by the spreadsheet by roughly 1/3 of a point of weapon skill, or about 2.3 AP.  Throw in the fact that, with end-game optimal gear, Don Alejandro's puts you better positioned relative to the roundoff points of Vitality for both Agi and Sta (trust me, it does), and you'll find that in a real world scenario, Don Alejandro's gains a couple of AP relative to the Vashj belt due to these roundoffs.  Again, not a major deal, but for two belts as closely spaced as these, every little bit matters.<br>
<br>
In conclusion: it really is a matter of personal preference. For the reasons above (and some other, even more vague ones, like how hard it may or may not be to convince your guild leadership to let you socket a Vashj drop with BT gems relative to a Hyjal drop), I do have a slight inclination towards Don Alejandro's.  However, I could easily see someone having the reverse preference; there's really no wrong answer between these two.</div>

</div>Well, detailed analysis from a screenshot is hard, but here's my take on the matter:<br>
<br>
1) I may be a bit off in terms of what Tidewalker's armor is.  This comes back to my desire for a more systematic study of how much armor various bosses have.<br>
<br>
2) There will always be a certain amount of variance in these things anyway.<br>
<br>
3) As the fight was not endless, it is likely that some of your cooldowns and whatever were able to be used more than is modeled by this sheet (in particular: AR is a 5 min cool, so if you're able to use it, for instance, twice in 7 minutes, that's going to make something of a difference).<br>
<br>
4) A member of your group mentions in chat that he missed the heroism.  Presumably this means heroism was used, and, as you were never graved, you probably did benefit from it, which would increase your DPS by a nontrivial amount.<br>
<br>
Fundamentally, though, even given 1-3 above, I am somewhat concerned about this discrepancy, as it does seem overlarge.  However, there's not a lot I can do to debug it just from a screenshot; a combatlog, or WWS, or even a Recap, would be more useful to me.</div>

		<div id="post_message_479979">A quick followup on the topic of heroism (and Blood Lust, but since I'm alliance, I'm going to use the term "Heroism" throughout), which relates both to my previous post and the earlier discourse on belts:<br>
<br>
I have performed some rough estimates on the effects of heroism, and here is what I've concluded:<br>
<br>
a) Heroism is a reasonable source of damage output; in particular, each heroism increases the dps estimate by around 20-25 DPS, depending on your gear level.  So if, for instance, you got a one heroism in an 8 minute fight, that by itself would account for nearly 1/3 of the difference between the sheet and your actual measurement.<br>
<br>
b) However, despite the contributions to DPS, Heroism and Haste Pots do not overwhelmingly increase the value of hit; in particular, even with drinking a Haste Pot every 2 minutes, and getting 3 heroisms in a 5 minute fight (which is about the upper limit on reasonable number of heroism to include), Belt of One Hundred Deaths pulls ahead of Don Alejandro's by less than 2 AP, although it does put Glinting gems back ahead of Delicate ones.  Hence, I'm of the opinion that the earlier analysis regarding interrupted fights and roundoff threshholds still stands, and that the benefits of Heroism is insufficient to outweigh them.  Your mileage may vary, of course, but, personally, barring significant new findings in the realm of weapon skill behavior, I'm inclined to say that I would rather have Don Alejandro's than the Vashj belt as my endgame belt.</div>

		<div id="post_message_480064">There's enough fights where there's general AoE damage that I think it's a mistake to discount stamina entirely - while DPS is certainly more important, there clearly exist some amount of DPS that's worth trading for stamina (as a simple example: given the choice betwen 1 AP or 100 sta, which would you take?).  And, personally, given a choice between 2.5 DPS and 120 HP, it seems to me that there's a reasonable case to be made for the 120 HP.  Again: some of you will certainly disagree, and that's fine.  But I'll just say: the weighted total option is in the sheet (and is the default) for a reason.  And that reason is that I believe there is some value in that stamina.</div>

		<div id="post_message_480110">It's true, though I would note that the amount of sta you have in end SSC/TK gear is not really adequate for much of MH/BT... and the point of gearing in end-BT gear is to get ready for Sunwell Plateau, which is an unknown entity at this stage - it could very well be that 10k unbuffed HP (which is about what my ideal gear winds up with) is only marginally adequate for Sunwell.<br>
<br>
But, yeah, you have a valid point in that MH/BT do tend to be somewhat more sta-heavy than gear in previous instances, and running up around 10k by the end of it is pretty straightforward.  But I still maintain that 2.5 DPS (or less) for 120 stamina is not exactly an unreasonable tradeoff even if you already have quite a bit of sta already.<br>
<br>
Again: DPS is certainly more important.  Which is why Sta isn't weighted very heavily (1 sta = .6 AP, meaning something like 1 dps = 3-4 sta).  And while a case could probably be made to lower that further, I'm not sure I buy that it should go to zero.</div>

An argument can be made for both sides which is why the option is up to the user to choose weighted, offensive, or defensive.  Up until a week or so ago I was rockin 8300 hp while another rogue in the raid had like 10,500hp.  I'd sure as heck be more comfortable at 10,500. I just run in to a lot more:  "OH SHIZ!" situations and as such have to be super carefull about the places I put myself in.<br>

I know it's not quite aqurate on anything other than level 70, but I like to try and optimize and do the calculation.<br>
<br>
Necklace of the Deep as you guessed seems quite superb especially at level 65 and would like to see just how superb. <br>

</div>The sockets on the front page were something that Darlal set up, and I honestly haven't given them a lot of thought. I do believe them to be sufficient for everything except necklaces, and there are a couple slots where I think they're even a bit excessive (like, I'm not aware of any 3-socket gloves or bracers.  Or even any 2-socket bracers).<br>
<br>
Specifically regarding Necklace of the Deep: it was actually in the sheet for a couple of months, until I realized that it had been broken + nonfunctional in the sheet for all that time.  Given that in 3 months no one had complained about it, I figured it probably wasn't in high demand and took it out.<br>

</div>Well, I don't think there was any argument that on new content bosses there's a place for stamina (although, 1.0?  dang...)  I think the immediate debate concerned end-BT level gear, which sort of by definition means you're not working on new content anymore.  <br>
<br>
However, I would argue that the entire discussion is to some extent moot, given that it doesn't really change what's optimal.  With the defense weighting being anything between 0 and 1.2 or so, the only slot that changes at all in the endgame gear is, you guessed it, the belt.  There are certainly some changes in margin - that is, how much item A beats item B by (for instance, with a weighting of 1.2, Telonicus is comparable to Choker of Endless Nightmares rather than 20+ points behind).  But, fundamentally, there's not a lot of debate over what's best outside of belts.  And belts, as I've said, really comes down to personal preference more than anything else - as noted, my reasons for preferring Don's Alejandro's has more to do with subtleties not included in the spreadsheet than they do anything else.<br>

</div>Correct.  This sheet is optomized for level 70 rogues fighting level 73 bosses.  Therefore, if you're not at the very least starting Karazhan, what's in this sheet will not be terribly applicable to you.  I mean, it may give a rough ballpark figure, but certainly nothing better than that.  This is pretty much the reason why the itemization stops where it does; there is at least one item for each slot that should be reasonably accessible to a Karazhan rogue, and, as such, there's not a whole lot of reason to add items below that to the sheet.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I find it a bit weird that you guys are talkign about Don Alejandro's Money Belt and Belt of One-Hundred Deaths.<br>
<br>
I just passed on Belt of One-Hundred Deaths because this spreadsheet comfirmed my own comparison with Belt of Deep Shadow. Belt of Deep Shadow is for me just as good as either belt but is dkp free and crafted pretyt much the second you step into SSC. It's also alot better then anything you get before entering SSC so everybody is bound to have this piece of craftwork. In fact there isn't a single belt that scores significantly better then Belt of Deep Shadow according to this spreadsheet.<br>
<br>
Is there any reason you guys completely ignore this Belt of Deep Shadow in your comparisons of it's 2 alternatives?</div>

	</tr>
	</table>
</div>Me and Aldriana were talking about our respective end-game "want" gear (Which are identical I guess in regards of most things.) With the exception of the belt. <br>
<br>
Deep Shadow is really good though. But for my dream gear I'd want One-Hundred Deaths (Mainly because I mostly play as mutilate.)<br>
<br>
On another note. I've so far put spending my arena points but this week I'll be reaching the cap and nothing else to buy.<br>
So I'm torn between sword or fist. Post-patch Fist+OH Sword would be the best combination I guess?</div>

</div>Mmm, in my spreadsheet Dons belt is by far the worst belt at my current gear level dropping my dps by 4 over belt of deep shadows which in turn is only 0,1dps behind 100-deaths.<br>
<br>
I also tried plugging in gear from MH and BT without actualy grabbing any tier 6 stuff (I won't soon see that as we're on Kael) and this still remains the same: bels of deep shadows is still better then dons belt although 100-belt overtakes by 1.5 dps now.<br>
Only when I plug in the very best of the best endgear dons bels overtakes deep shadow while 100-belt stays the winner. (EDIT: meh, kinda forgot gems and a few pieces.. don wins in the end over 100 and deep shadow)<br>
<br>
Then again... blizz just HAS to 'fix' Shadow-walker's Cord right? :o<br>
<br>
On another subject.. this spreadsheet puts vile poisons in favour over imp poisons. In practice I find myself running around too often to justify speccing for vile. In an ideal situation (as a spreadsheet) I can see vile being better but in practice where often a deadly stack will wear of I still think imp poison is the better choice.<br>
Anyone care to share their insights on this?</div>

</div>Well, here's the argument on belts as I see it:<br>
<br>
Either you only care about raw DPS, or you care about the weighted total of stamina + avoidance + DPS.<br>
<br>
In the first case, Belt of One Hundred Deaths does more DPS than Belt of Deep Shadows.  In the second, the high stamina on Don Alejandro's puts it in the lead.  So while Belt of Deep Shadows may have more DPS than Don Alejandro's, if you're worrying about DPS alone you shouldn't be using either.  Fundementally: depending on your exact preferences you can justify using either Don Alejandro's or One Hundred Deaths; but regardless of your exact preferences, Deep Shadows will not be optimal by any reasonable defenition.<br>

</div>So, the sheet prefers vile poisons, simply because... it's modeling endless combat, so issues like the one you raise never enter the equation.  In practice, on a more interrupted fight, you could make a case for imp poison being better.  The general rule of thumb, though, is that if a fight is worth using Deadly Poison at all on, it's probably worth having Vile Poisons rather than Improved, as the faster stacking from Imp Poisons is only going to overtake the extra damage from Vile if the fight is less than 20 seconds or so long, at which point Deadly is sort of a questionable choice in the first place. Also, I would argue that there's very few 20 sec fights where your damage output on the level of poison selection matters.  So, personally, I prefer Vile.</div>

</div>Well, I hate to just say "because I'm right and they're wrong", so lets see if I can be a little more helpful...<br>
<br>
On any particular item, the two sheets will often disagree on the value of certain items.  The reason for this is that the two sheets have very different models for rogue DPS, and thus have different levels of accuracy for different effects.  On the whole, I believe this sheet to be more accurate than the other (as if I didn't, I wouldn't have bothered to write it).  Ultimately, you need to decide which sheet you trust more.<br>
<br>
In the specific case of RPV: I believe that, on the whole, this sheet tends to value +hit more than the other, due to the fact that I model all procs as procs rather than static bonuses, which thus includes the subtlety "you cannot proc unless you hit", which understandably drives up the value of hit.  This is probably at least some of the difference.<br>
<br>
However, it is also possible that the two sheets have different values for the proc rate on RPV entered; in this case, I can't actually claim with certainty that I have the correct values, as while I have done some rough testing myself, I am not aware of any firm conclusion being reached (or at least, there's no ultimate conclusion found in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080215235603/http://elitistjerks.com/f31/t14375-rogue_mechanics_testing_thread/" target="_blank">http://elitistjerks.com/f31/t14375-r...esting_thread/</a>).  As such, while I believe my estimate of it's proc rate to be in the correct ballpark, it is entirely possible that it is misestimating the amount to some extent, which may explain some part of the discrepancy in the sheets.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I have a question regarding calculation of uptime for trinkes with cooldown:<br>
<br>
Should that not be caluated as<br>
uptime = Duration /( Cooldown + 1/(PPS *HPS) )<br>
or aequivalent<br>
uptime = (Duration *PPS)/(Cooldown*PPS +1/HPS)<br>
<br>
HPS=total hits/sec. <br>
PPS= procs per sec calculated based on hasted weapon speed<br>
1/(PPS*HPS) is the time to next proc.<br>
<br>
Do I miss something here?  (...again <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080215235603im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/wink.gif" border="0" alt="" title=";)" class="inlineimg"> )</div>

</div>So, I'm not exactly sure what you're objecting to here, so I'm going to address both things:<br>
<br>
1) With regards to hasted weapon speed consideration: this is currently not modeled in this sheet, as the last revision occurred before the new findings regarding weapon speed and haste.  This update will be in the next version.<br>
<br>
2) With regards to the extra term in the calculations: that is done on the line before.  By "procs per second" I mean "the actual probability that a proc will occur during any given second", which is computed as hits*procrate, in the previous line.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Many thanks for this spreadsheet. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080215235603im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":)" class="inlineimg">  It's been wonderful as my guild starts getting into SSC/TK, especially for evaluating marginal upgrades.<br>
<br>
Also, a question: Everything I've read, including these forums and the Rogue Gear Spreadsheet, say that 308 +hit is required not to miss.  I have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080215235603/http://www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Proudmoore&amp;n=Xandria" target="_blank">310 +hit, 2/2 Weapon Expertise and 5/5 Precision</a>, yet I still miss ~6% of the time.  (Actual numbers vary from 5.7% - 6.1%; these are provided by both Recap and my guild's WWS logs.)  I figure I must be overlooking something obvious, but I can't work out what it is.  Does anybody have any thoughts on what may be causing me to miss so much?</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</div>Recap and WWS's overall hit number counts dodges, parries, and blocks as misses.  If you're attacking from behind, as usual, this works out to about 5.5% of attacks missed to these effects.  As such, your miss rate, even without any actual "misses" with show up as 5% or more in many cases.  However, if you look at the detailed breakdown with either program, it will correctly break it down into hits, dodges, etc.<br>
<br>
So: you're probably not actually missing that much.  You're just getting dodged that much, and, alas, there's no good way to fix that.</div>

		<div id="post_message_484966">Actually, modeling PPM proc rates and uptime should now be a lot easier. Our two working assumptions, currently, are:<br>
<br>
1) White attacks have dynamically recalculated proc rates for PPM procs, so that over time you get the same average PPM regardless of hastes.<br>
2) Yellow attacks do not dynamically recalculate proc rates for PPM procs; their proc rate is based on the unhasted speed of the main hand.<br>
<br>
Thus we can figure the total PPM and proc uptime as such:<br>
<br>
MH PPM = PPM * (1 - MH Miss% - MH Dodge%)<br>
OH PPM = PPM * (1 - OH Miss% - OH Dodge%)<br>
<br>
SP Proc% = PPM * MH Speed / 60<br>
SP PPM = (60 / SP Speed�*) * SP Proc% * (1 - SP Miss% - SP Dodge%) (which simplifies to ---&gt;)<br>
SP PPM = PPM * (1 - SP Miss% - SP Dodge%) * MH Speed / SP Speed�*<br>
<br>
Total PPM = MH PPM + OH PPM + SP PPM<br>
Total PPM = ((1 - MH Miss% - MH Dodge%) + (1 - OH Miss% - OH Dodge%) + (1 - SP Miss% - SP Dodge%) * MH Speed / SP Speed�*) * PPM<br>
Total PPS = Total PPM / 60<br>
<br>
�*SP Speed is the average number of seconds between special attacks performed (define special attacks as any yellow attack that can cause a proc; Sinister Strike, Backstab, Hemorrhage, Mutilate, Eviscerate, Envenom all count; I'm not 100% if Rupture does or not; Slice and Dice does not). You can either calculate this simply as the energy cost of your special of choice divided by 10, or you can calculate it more exactly by taking the number of specials performed in your cycle divided by the duration of your cycle.<br>
<br>
Now that we have the average number of procs per second, we can calculate uptime for either kind of proc.<br>
<br>
No Cooldown Proc: 1 - (1 - Total PPS)^(Duration)<br>
Cooldown Proc: (Duration * Total PPS) / (Cooldown * Total PPS + 1)<br>
<br>
(edit) Note that we can also account for sword spec and Windfury pretty easily, although the equation becomes a bit muddy. Let's separate it into parts:<br>
<br>
MH PPM = PPM * (1 - MH Miss% - MH Dodge%) * ((1 + Windfury) * (1 + MH SS) + OH SS + SP SS)<br>
Windfury = 20% * (1 - MH Miss% - MH Dodge%)<br>
MH SS = 5% * (1 - MH Miss% - MH Dodge%)<br>
OH SS = 5% * (1 - OH Miss% - OH Dodge%) * MH Speed / OH Speed<br>
SP SS = 5% * (1 - SP Miss% - SP Dodge%) * MH Speed / SP Speed�*<br>
<br>
Keep in mind each type of attack is multiplied by two kinds of chances to attack because first, an attack must land to be able to cause that extr attack, and then that extra attack must land to be able to cause the proc in question.</div>

</div>I'm not sure if you're aware of Excel's stupid powerful iterative calculation feature, but I started using it in my own spreadsheet and found it allowed me to accurately model the haste feedback loop. Basically you can set up a circular reference in some calculation in your spreadsheet, and Excel will give you an error -- then go to the settings dialog to the "Calculations" tab and turn on Iteration and BAM, it recalculates your circular reference down to within a threshold you can specify.<br>
<br>
The only problem I've found is that if you get particularly fancy with it, it can break (at which point you'd need to cut off the circular link at some point so that Excel can figure out a new starting point to recalculate). But I'd think that, based on the way your sheet is set up, it would work without any complaints.<br>
<br>
Regarding yellow attacks and haste, did you see these two posts?<br>

		<div id="post_message_484988">My sense is that macros in Excel and macros in OO aren't compatable, which is why I'm not using them.  That said, the manual-loop method that I'm using works just fine; all I'm saying is that the changes, while they affect the rate of convergeance of the loop, they do not eliminate the need for it.<br>
<br>
Regarding yellow attacks and haste: Yes, I saw those posts.  Here's my counterargument:<br>
<br>
1) Fiery does not seem to reduce in proc rate with haste as the expansion procs do; as such, the fact that it's proc rate on instants is not reduced by haste doesn't mean a whole heck of a lot.<br>
<br>
2) The proc rate of RPV was barely reduced on white attacks by haste; since some procs seems to be reduced and others not, there's no particuar reason to assume that it has to be.  Thus, I would want to see a larger data set showing conclusively that RPV proc rate is reduced by haste before accepting that data.<br>
<br>
3) Hence, the only one of those 3 data sets that I put much faith in at all is the third, which, while it is a reasonable test of a proc who's proc rate has been shown to drop via haste, is still flawed; the data set is far too small to show that there's conclusively a difference.<br>
<br>
So: while I do agree it's more likely, based on that data, that some PPM effects are reduced by haste, I don't think it has been proved beyond reasonable doubt.<br>
<br>
As an additional note: given that some procs exhibit proc reduction rate with haste and some do not, it would probably be worth testing more different procs to classify which do and which do not, which has not been done to the best of my knowledge.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Just a quick query regarding this excellent spreadsheet.  Apologies in advance if this has already been covered elsewhere.<br>
<br>
When I remove sword specialisation, the value of the offhand swords goes up.  This seems a little strange.  Can anyone supply the reason for this?</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</div>The absolute score goes up.  The relative score goes down.<br>
<br>
Expanding that a bit:<br>
<br>
The scoring values are based off of effective AP; that is, how much AP would provide an equivalent benefit to the stats on the item in question.  Hence, if a talent or gear selection makes a significant difference to the value of one point of AP, the scores can move in some counterintuitive directions.<br>
<br>
Looking, for instance, at the default gear in 0.7.7:<br>
<br>
With the initial talents + gear, the Merciless Gladiator's OH is scored at 519.44.  If we remove sword spec, it goes up to 535.52.  What this means is that the loss of sword spec decreases the value of a point of AP more than it decreases the value of my OH sword.  It doesn't mean that sword spec is bad or any such thing; note that all the other numbers move in the direction you would expect; DPS goes down from 1450.26 to 1370.9, and the relative value of Quickblade to nonsword weapons decreases (Messenger of Fate goes from inferior to Quickblade to a 52 AP upgrade).<br>
<br>
Basically, it's an artifact of the scoring system.</div>

</div>First off: again, scores are AP, not DPS.<br>

Secondly: well, we said that we'd need to make up at least 7 AP or so by resocketing.  Per your estimates, we gain ~8 AP per gem.  Hence, we'd need to make up about 9 AP on socket bonuses for it to be worth it.<br>
<br>
Now, if you're stuffing the blue gem in, like, Skulker's Greaves: yeah, sure, it's not going to be worth it.  But generally there's at least a couple of items with halfway decent socket bonuses, so if you can activate two of them, it's usually worth it.<br>

		<div id="post_message_489705">Sword spec was not nerfed by a noticable amount.  Any difference you're observing is probably observer bias.  Consider:<br>
<br>
In roughly 4 hours in SSC last night, I landed a total of 7367 attacks, of which 362 were sword spec procs.  Hence, 365/7002 = 5.17% of eligible attacks procced - very close to the expected 5.00%.  So sword spec is working the way one would expect right now.<br>
<br>
With the old chain-procs, 5% of those 362 procs would generate another hit - or about 18 additional hits - of which 5% would generate yet another hit - for a total of roughly 19 extra hits.<br>
<br>
19 extra hits out of 7365 total attacks is, roughly speaking, a quarter of a percent difference.  Hence, if you did 1500 DPS before, the sword spec nerf will drop you to... 1496 DPS, aka, barely noticable.</div>

</div>It's entirely possible that you did have fewer of them on Teron, but, looking at the larger parse for the week:<br>
<br>
On the Wed 26 Sep Anetheron-Gorefiend parse, you had 10632 melee hits, 2101 hemo hits, 10 Ghostly Strikes, 7 kicks, and 2 gouges; of those 10632 hits, an estimated 609 were Sword Spec hits; hence, there were a total of 12143 attacks eligible for SS procs, and 641 total sword spec procs, which works out to a proc rate of 5.28%<br>
<br>
On the Wed 19 Sep Hyjan and BT to Teron parse, you had 12927 melee hits, 2718 sinister strikes, 6 kicks, and 1 gouge; an estimated 695 of the melee hits were SS procs, for a total of 15055 eligible attacks, and 734 total sword spec procs, which works out to a proc rate of 4.88%<br>
<br>
So, over the course of the night, you actually had a *higher* sword spec proc rate this week than last.  So while on any given fight it might be higher or lower, on the night as a whole, it's pretty even.<br>

My only concern with putting in time-averaged raid-buff stats is that the numbers that will generate are numbers that can never and will never appear on your character screen; they're designed to reflect your average over the course of a fight, which means that unless you have absolutely no procs at all going, they aren't anything you will ever actually see.</div>

I didn't realize you were counting the hit rating box already there as separate. Miss % would be redundant in that case, in my opinion, as it's not something terribly hard to extrapolate from your hit rating. AP, Crit, HP would be good then.<br>
<br>
By the way, something interesting I tried out last night on Mother Shahraz; I decided to go without Dragonspine Trophy (blasphemy I know), since my hit rating was pretty low in SR, and used Ashtongue Talisman and Madness of the Betrayer. I got FA once and my partner rogue (who was using Ashtongue and Dragonspine and more or less gear/SR on par with mine) got FA twice. When the fight ended I was about 5k damage behind him which, considering he lost maybe 10-15 seconds of DPS time from the one extra FA, shows me how significant the DST nerf really was. Just some anecdotal information to throw out there.</div>

</div>Thanks for the correction, that makes the RED still the better choice for me right now.  <br>

<br>
I'd personally like to see hit rating (with % + talents) and possibly haste rating &amp; % with even an option for armor penetration and avg uptime.  I know this is probably a lot, but things that I can't look at on my character sheet in game/wow armory would be nice.  Even Possible weapon skill --&gt; crit and hit vs which mobs.  Meh, I'm probably blowing minds by now, but just be nice to see a plethora of information incorporated into such a great spreadsheet.... *one-stop shopping*</div>

</div>Agreed, just pointing out that we already can see our base stats, buffed and unbuffed on the sheets, but we only see a %hit instead of hit rating (which for most people is easier to understand).  Also don't show passive haste anywhere or armor penetration.  And tbh, I'm guessing the majority of the rogues using these sheets have some form of weapon skill (hit and crit on bosses), armor penetration or haste and aren't still struggling with karazhan and trying to see if Malcheezan is better than the Emerald Ripper.  Just my guess though...<br>
<br>
<br>
Also, has anyone done the math, or could show me the base math that I could do to find out if the new 20agi &gt; mongoose?<br>
<br>
Reasonably, I'd think that with the "1ppm" system, gettings 1 proc every minute would equal out to 30 agi over the min for that weapon + the attack speed boost (120 agi x 15 secs / 60 secs total = 30agi).  Thing is I usually have mongoose proc and double proc or ever double proc and reproc itself to keep it up on two weapons for a full 30 seconds.  Just wondering others thoughts or testing?</div>

<br>
With regards to stat summaries: what I'm leaning towards at the moment is putting AP/Crit/HP on the front page, and then a  more detailed stat block on the advanced settings page.  Sound like a reasonable option?</div>

Also, perhaps a "white damage" and "yellow damage" scaling meter. Something that can incorporate haste and armor penetration into one collective group. Something along the lines of working at 108% white damage and 110% yellow damage. Or show only percentage gains, something like that. Just something to see a concrete value for these two effects that scale with your gear unlike other stats. Does anyone else think that may be a help?</div>

We are an early SSC level guild (i.e. started dropping Lurker, working on Tidewalker, dropped Gruul a few times and about 75% have T4 from High King, never dropped Mags - only tried once, farmed the hell out of Kara) in terms of gear level.<br>
<br>
Given that high agility tends to lend itself to a high crit rate, I'd call Expose Weakness a 100% proc.  Maybe at the lower gear levels it isn't 100%, but I'd surmise as gear improves Expose Weakness from a good Hunter is a constant.  I believe our Hunter was claiming a 35% raid crit rate, if that helps put things into perspective.</div>

Usually when they word things like that it means "We're going to demarcate two categories, melee finishers and non-melee finishers, with Deadly Throw being the sole member of the latter".<br>

</div>I'm surprised you're seeing striking at only 6 AP - for me, it tends to be up around 11-12.  But it's most definitely not 50+ AP, unless there's some hidden mechanic at work that's unknown to me.<br>
<br>
Consider, for instance, the impact of 14 AP on my weapons, which are of speeds 2.7 and 1.5.  To my main hand, 14 AP, which grants 1 DPS, would thus effectively add 2.7 weapon damage to my main hand autoattacks; 2.4 damage to my main hand instant attacks; and 1.5 damage to my offhand attacks.  Since MH damage tends to account for a larger portion of one's damage than OH damage, it should be at least plausible to you that this benefit (2.7/2.4 to MH, 1.5 to OH) is superior to 2 damage to all attacks, particularly when you factor in that the AP would also increase my rupture damage slightly.  As such, it seems fairly clear to me, at least, that 2 weapon damage should be worth less than 14 AP - for a sword rogue, anyway.<br>
<br>
For a dagger rogue, with faster attacks, Striking is presumably worth somewhat more, but even then it would not be in the 50 AP range.<br>

</div>It's not in the sheet because it doesn't make any difference to the calculations this sheet does.  This sheet is modeling sustained combat, in which rupture is superior to eviscerate.  Therefore, no eviscerates are ever used in the damage calculations; hence Improved Eviscerate would make absolutely no difference whatsoever to the calculations it performs.  Thus, sense it's totally meaningless to the sheet, I saw no reason to put it in.</div>

</div>It may be because of my low hit right now (234) and so it would decrease its value?  Not sure, but either way, I show it far less than 50 and about half of what you show.  <br>
<br>
That was my reasoning as well, the dmg is only as good as the attack speed.  Also, wouldnt it affect BS a little more because of the multiplier?  Just a thought, but even then, I dont think 150% x 11-12ap is still only 16-18ap.  WAY below the 50ap mark.  Hmm.  I'll ask these guys to give me math or hidden aspects of weapon damage that I dont know and possibly enlighten myself and even the spreadsheet in the end, but I'm guessing its some idiots attempt to justify his choice over another.  <br>
<br>
I spent &lt;1k gold to level LW and got 12-15dps increase from swiftstrike.  I will get around 10-12 from already having JC.  I'm not going to spend 3-5k gold to get enchanting for 11-12 ap.  LOL</div>

</div>I'll find a place to host it and then load it up later tonite after my night class.  Not sure why it shows so low a value, but it just keeps me from wanting to level it even more. Also, even at 2k, that seems overly expensive for a profession that, on average, doesn't make much money in the end and only would offer these two ring enchants, nothing really substantial that is "BOP-profession holder only" type thing. Maybe once I'm complete in end-game gear and want to assert an extra 20-30 ap that I can't get any other way, I'll drop one of my two professions.  Until then, nah.<br>
<br>
<br>
I see what you did now, that makes sense.  So together, the ring enchants give around 30ap, generally.  That's not bad, but again, I don't see it being worth it until you're completely decked out in end-game gear/weps with no other avenue of dps increase...</div>

<br>
Enchanting gives two ring enchants, totaling +8 str, agi, and sta, which works out to about 30 AP of offensive benefit.<br>
<br>
Jewelcrafting gives the ability to include BoP epic gems in your gear; however, only two of the JC gems (Delicate Fire Ruby and Rigid Bladestone) are actually upgrades over BT gems; hence you gain a grand total of 2 agi and 2 hit relative to socketing the same two slots with Glinting Pyrestones, for a net benefit of about 10 AP.<br>
<br>
Leatherworking gives you no long-term passive benefits, as Swiftstrike is not best-in-slot anywhere; however, the ability to make and use drums can be fairly beneficial; if used every time the cool is up, they provide about a 50 AP benefit in a sustained DPS scenario... to your entire group.  This does get expensive after a while, of course, so in practice they tend to be used more selectively; however, it's still a nontrivial bonus in the endgame.<br>
<br>
As such, in terms of a late BT rogue, there is a pretty compelling argument to be made for Leatherworking/Enchanting as the best two professions, with Enchanting/JC being the alternative.<br>
<br>
Now, in practice, most of us aren't to that level of progression, and while in SSC/TK/early BT/whatever, a number of other professions have merit (Engineering for Deathblow goggles; more of the JC gems are worth using, etc.).

</div>I wasn't putting Enchanting as a "provides no BOP" aspect, I was trying to say that benefits gained right now are miniscule compared to JC/LW for myself.  <br>
<br>
True, you gain 2 hit and 2 agi but you also go another 4ap (Crimson Sun 24ap) over the 20ap BT gem.  Also, as far as I can tell the Rigid Bladestone (12hit) didnt make it into the patch, or is it off a vendor I didnt notice?  <br>
<br>
But for a pre Hyjal/BT rogue, as myself, with gems going to casters first, since we're a caster guild...ugh... I actually gain 8ap on the crimson sun, 6agi and 6hit over my current gems, making a benefit of almost 32ap, counting hit and agi as 2ap of course.  <br>
<br>
As for LW, I gain the swiftstrike set which, until BT/Late-Hyjal shoulders/wrists, are the best for a rogue, even post 2.2.  As we get into Hyjal and I get upgrades, I will certainly be looking at sacrificing LW for possibly Enchanting, but probably not until Inscription comes out in the XP to see if that is a viable melee dps profession (as of now, I dont think it will be, but we'll see).  <br>
<br>
All in all, I agree with you fully, end-game professions will probably be Enchanting/LW for most rogues pre-XP, but as of now, I'm not willing to lose the time/money invested in LW/JC until I've started to get my fill of BT gems.  By the way, how common are these gems/patterns?  I've heard anything from fairly common to horrible drop rates and wondering, if farming just first 2 bosses of Hyjal and first 3-4 bosses of BT in an effort to gain raid experience, could we be seeing a large amount of gems/patterns, or are we going to be bickering each night over a gem or two? lol</div>

		<div id="post_message_494915">Two things:<br>
1)  Actually, I can think of a reason to model Improved Eviscerate, namely Rupture immune mobs.  This is another reason some might spec Improved Eviscerate since you'll have to be using Eviscerate to spend those extra combo points.  Although, that said, such an addition should be considered a bonus.  I wouldn't worry about it until the sheet is finally the way you want it in terms of Rupture as the primary finishing move.<br>
<br>
2)  Speaking of the Crystalforged Trinket, it would be nice if this was added to the sheet.

				<div style="font-style:italic">Two things:<br>
1)  Actually, I can think of a reason to model Improved Eviscerate, namely Rupture immune mobs.  This is another reason some might spec Improved Eviscerate since you'll have to be using Eviscerate to spend those extra combo points.  Although, that said, such an addition should be considered a bonus.  I wouldn't worry about it until the sheet is finally the way you want it in terms of Rupture as the primary finishing move.</div>

</div>Yes, Eviscerate cycles are something that's on the list as something that might be nice to have someday.  However, they're so far down on the list I have no reasonable expectation of ever getting around to them.<br>
<br>
Also, while we're on the topic of Imp Evis, I would like to remind people that even if you *are* using Eviscerate as a finisher in PvE, this talent is usually not worth it.  The amount of dps you gain from it is point-for-point less than Vile Poisons; hence, it's only those mobs that are both bleed and poison immune where Improved Eviscerate is actually beneficial.  Now, there are certainly bosses that this is true of - Hydross, Void Reaver, and Doomwalker come to mind - but on the whole, trading a damage boost that works for 75% of boss fights for one that provides a smaller benefit on the remaining 25% just doesn't make much sense.  Therefore, I would attribute the presence of Imp Evis in Combat Swords builds to either a) a desire for increased PvP viability, or b) ignorance.  I suspect the 2nd is the more common cause.<br>

</div>Honestly, this trinket would be pretty far down on the list.  Even as a dagger rogue I don't see it scoring above 95 AP or so, which puts it behind everything on the sheet by 15 or more AP with the exception of Kiss of the Spider - which, honestly, given the haste nerf, I will probably be removing from the sheet as well.  It's not that it's a terrible trinket, per se, but the fact is that it isn't really in the same league as the trinkets already in the sheet - and there are plenty of trinkets in the list already that are accessible to Kara-level rogues.<br>
<br>
However, if people are of the opinion that more low-end gear is necessary as they're finding themselves in mid-Kara without some of the gear on this sheet, I can review the itemization selections again.<br>

</div>I was a bit surprised by this statement, so I went and did some math:<br>
<br>
Untalented, a 5 stack of deadly poison is 75 dps. Each point of vile poisons adds 75*0.04 = 3 dps. (Assuming you've got windfury over instant poison MH, of course) Assuming an average 5 point eviscerate is 1600, including crit, each point of improved eviscerate adds 80 damage to each evis. So for a point of vile poisons to add more dps than a point of improved eviscerate, you'd have to eviscerate less than once every (1600*0.05/x = 75*0.04) 26.6 seconds. This might be the case for daggers, but definitely not for swords.<br>
<br>
It's a bit of a moot point anyway, since I can't think of any bosses past Kara that are immune to rupture but not poisons, but I just thought that sounded off. Hopefully I did that math correctly.</div>

</div>So, admittedly, last time I did the calcs was, um, before anyone had killed Kael, so it was based more off T4/T5 type itemization, which lowers the value of Improved Eviscerate.  Hence, Imp Evis does fair better than I remembered.  However, there's a couple points I'd like to add:<br>
<br>
The thing to remember about Eviscerate cycles is that they take an extra 10 energy relative to Rupture cycles, meaning that it's hard for a sword rogue without 2/5 T4 to get a cycle shorter than 4s5r - which takes roughly 27 seconds to complete.  So, first off, we're totally in the right ballpark for them to be comparable, by your numbers.<br>
<br>
Second: I'm pretty sure Supremus is affected by poisons but not rupture.  I think there may be others as well, though I don't remember for certain.<br>
<br>
Third: the existance of bosses affected by poison but not rupture was only half of my point.  The other half is that, as the benefit gained by Vile Poison on bosses affected by poison is at least comparable to the benefit gained by Imp Evis on bosses immune to rupture, in order for the utility to be comparable, there'd need to be at least as many unrupturable bosses as there are poisonable bosses - which is not the case.  Hence my opinion that poisons are fairly clearly a superior choice.</div>

</div>Intuitively, such a cycle will be inferior to either 4s/5r or 3s/5r. You can see this by observing the following theorem:<br>
<br>
- For any Z &gt; X and any Y, and assuming swords are used, the cycle Zs/Yr has at least as high Slice and Dice uptime as Xs/Yr.<br>
<br>
This is pretty easily proven. At worst, to generate a single extra CP, you must spend 40 energy, which will take at most 4 seconds to generate. With 3/3 Imp SnD, each additional CP spent on Slice and Dice increases its duration by 4.35 seconds. Thus, increasing your SnD coefficient increases your Slice uptime by 0.35 seconds per additional CP spent. It is possible that the cycle Xs/Yr already has 100% Slice uptime. In that case, Zs/Yr would also have 100% Slice uptime.<br>
<br>
This proven, let's look at the two cycles 4s/5r and 3s/5r. There are two possible cases:<br>
<br>
- 3s/5r has 100% Slice uptime, and therefore so does 4s/5r. In this case, both cycles get identical damage contribution from Slice and Dice. However, 4s/5r takes longer to complete, and therefore has lower Rupture uptime and lower Rupture DPS. Thus, running 4s/5r/3s/5r would be strictly inferior to running 3s/5r.<br>
<br>
- 3s/5r does not have 100% Slice uptime, and 4s/5r has higher Slice uptime (possibly 100%, but it doesn't matter). In this case, you would lose significant DPS by running 3s/5r instead of 4s/5r. Therefore, running 4s/5r/3s/5r would be strictly inferior to running 4s/5r.<br>
<br>
There is almost no case where alternating cycles arbitrarily will achieve higher DPS. I did once model a type of cycle called a "Plus-cycle" where you would alter the coefficient of your finishers based on whether Ruthlessness or Netherblade 4-piece procced. Particularly, I was looking at a "+1s/5r" cycle, where you would always generate exactly 1 CP after Rupturing, and then Slice at either 1 CP or 2 CP (if Ruthlessness procced). However, my models almost always put this type of cycle behind the standard 2s/5r.</div>

</div>I would do either 4s5r or the weaving cycle that Koaschten mentions.  Although 5s5r doesn't cost you a whole lot of dps either, so if you're feeling particularly lazy it does fine as well.  I would not recommend 3s4r, though; the sub-5 rupture cycles don't tend to work very well as swords - they're more of a daggers thing.<br>
<br>
On the whole, switching to a shorter cycle doesn't change your Ashtongue uptime much; it means it lasts a larger proportion of the cycle when it does proc, but it doesn't proc all the time.  <br>
<br>
It should be noted that in the current release of the sheet, Ashtongue is being mis-scored slightly; for longer cycles (3s5r and above, basically) it's pretty close, but for the extremely compressed cycles (1s5r swords, 1s3r daggers, and the like) it's off by a fair amount.  This is being fixed in the next release.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Doesnt Rupture scale overall better with AP then Eviscerate? At least unless you get some ungodly amount of crit?<br>

</div>Rupture scales better with AP, period.  Rupture gains .24 damage per AP; Evis gains a base of .15, as modified by crit chance at armor.  Assuming a raid buffed crit rate of 50% (which is not totally out of reach but defenitely high-end) and 2000 armor penetration above and beyond sunders from buffs and gear (likewise) on a lightly armored boss (4000 base armor), that only works out to .19 actual damage per AP for evis.  To put into perspective what you'd need to get to to have Evis scale better: even if your target had zero armor, your crit rate would need to be over 60% for Evis to scale better.  In practice, even with decent armor penetration, mobs still tend to have ~20% mitigation, meaning you'd need 100% crit rate for Evis to scale as well as Rupture.<br>
<br>
...and of course, that doesn't even count the fact that Evis costs more energy, such that even if the raw damage of Evis scaled as well as Rupture, the value of the 10 energy difference would scale as well which would *still* give Rupture the edge.<br>
<br>
Long story short: Rupture starts out better than Eviscerate, and scales faster.  Hence, you should only use Evis if you can't use rupture, regardless of your AP, talent, etc. situation.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Intuitively, such a cycle will be inferior to either 4s/5r or 3s/5r. You can see this by observing the following theorem:<br>
<br>
- For any Z &gt; X and any Y, and assuming swords are used, the cycle Zs/Yr has at least as high Slice and Dice uptime as Xs/Yr.<br>
<br>
This is pretty easily proven. At worst, to generate a single extra CP, you must spend 40 energy, which will take at most 4 seconds to generate. With 3/3 Imp SnD, each additional CP spent on Slice and Dice increases its duration by 4.35 seconds. Thus, increasing your SnD coefficient increases your Slice uptime by 0.35 seconds per additional CP spent. It is possible that the cycle Xs/Yr already has 100% Slice uptime. In that case, Zs/Yr would also have 100% Slice uptime.<br>
<br>
This proven, let's look at the two cycles 4s/5r and 3s/5r. There are two possible cases:<br>
<br>
- 3s/5r has 100% Slice uptime, and therefore so does 4s/5r. In this case, both cycles get identical damage contribution from Slice and Dice. However, 4s/5r takes longer to complete, and therefore has lower Rupture uptime and lower Rupture DPS. Thus, running 4s/5r/3s/5r would be strictly inferior to running 3s/5r.<br>
<br>
- 3s/5r does not have 100% Slice uptime, and 4s/5r has higher Slice uptime (possibly 100%, but it doesn't matter). In this case, you would lose significant DPS by running 3s/5r instead of 4s/5r. Therefore, running 4s/5r/3s/5r would be strictly inferior to running 4s/5r.<br>
<br>
There is almost no case where alternating cycles arbitrarily will achieve higher DPS. I did once model a type of cycle called a "Plus-cycle" where you would alter the coefficient of your finishers based on whether Ruthlessness or Netherblade 4-piece procced. Particularly, I was looking at a "+1s/5r" cycle, where you would always generate exactly 1 CP after Rupturing, and then Slice at either 1 CP or 2 CP (if Ruthlessness procced). However, my models almost always put this type of cycle behind the standard 2s/5r.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</div>I think you've missed the point of the 3s5r4s5r cycle.  The argument is as follows:<br>
<br>
3s5r cannot be supported with 100% SnD uptime; hence it is clearly inferior.<br>
4s5r gives 100% SnD uptime, but clips the ends of the SnD uptimes, which costs DPS.<br>
<br>
Hence, to realize full DPS, you perform a 4s5r and then get the 3 CPs for the next SnD ready; however, before using them, you let your energy regen a bit for the last few seconds of the existing SnD.  Thus, when you launch the 3s (right as the previous 4s is ticking off, ideally; sooner if your energy is about to cap out), you're not starting from 0 energy; you have 50 energy or whatever saved up. This extra energy gives you sufficient time to fire off the 5r and still get up to 4 CPs for the next SnD before the 3s ticks off.<br>
<br>
Basically: you use the fact that you can store up energy for a few seconds to weave in 3s5rs amongst your 4s5rs, hence maintaining 100% SnD uptime (which 3s5r cannot do) but with better rupture uptime than 4s5r.<br>
<br>
In practice, this is very very hard to do, since cycles are not ideal and you will find that, in practice, the burstiness of Combat Potency, Relentless Strikes, and Ruthlessness procs will leave you with SnD gaps if you try this.  If max energy was 200 allowing more room to bank energy, this would be more feasible; however, since max energy is only 100, there's not enough flexibility in this cycle to avoid SnD gaps.  Hence, I would recommend 4s5r on the whole, though feel free to try the woven cycle out if it sounds interesting to you.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Honestly, this trinket would be pretty far down on the list.  Even as a dagger rogue I don't see it scoring above 95 AP or so, which puts it behind everything on the sheet by 15 or more AP with the exception of Kiss of the Spider - which, honestly, given the haste nerf, I will probably be removing from the sheet as well.  It's not that it's a terrible trinket, per se, but the fact is that it isn't really in the same league as the trinkets already in the sheet - and there are plenty of trinkets in the list already that are accessible to Kara-level rogues.<br>
<br>
However, if people are of the opinion that more low-end gear is necessary as they're finding themselves in mid-Kara without some of the gear on this sheet, I can review the itemization selections again.</div>

	</table>
</div>Well, according to the DPS Spreadsheet as a dagger rogue, the Crystalforged Trinket is only about 1.5 dps behind Hourglass and better than the other options available (given that I can't seem to get a DST or Poison Vial to drop), unless I'm missing something obvious.  I'm Exalted with all factions, have Abacus as my other Trinket.  Is there another accessible trinket I'm missing besides Hourglass?</div>

		<div id="post_message_495940">Well, lets see.  If I take my current gear and replace my weapons with the analagous daggers and my spec to the cookie-cutter 15/41/5, here's what I come up with:<br>
<br>
Striking to ring is worth 16.76 AP; hence +7 weapon damage from the trinket will be worth 3.5*16.76 = 58.7 AP.  The activated ability on Crystalforged is 216 AP with 16.7% uptime, and is thus worth 36 AP.  Hence, the total value of the trinket is 94.7<br>
<br>
Comparing this to other pre-Kara trinkets:<br>
<br>
Darkmoon Card - Crusade: 120<br>
Bloodlust Brooch: 116<br>
Abacus of Violent Odds: 114<br>
Icon of Unyielding Courage: 111<br>
Hourglass of the Unraveler: 110<br>
<br>
and, if you happen to have raided significantly pre-expansion:<br>
<br>
DFT: 106<br>
<br>
So, while it's true that Crystalforged isn't a *bad* trinket, given that it isn't even in the top 5 pre-raid trinkets, I don't feel the need to add it to the sheet.</div>

</div>First thing - I did find that about 13 pages through the thread, so apologies.  Whoever is doing the UI for this spreadsheet could possibly change the column to "Use Socket Bonus" it would probably save posts :]<br>
<br>
Haste question - Im confused about the value assigned to the TSD as compared to the other spreadsheet (sorry, my only frame of reference) it seems to be worth significantly less than what the other sheet represents it as, of course I can only estimate that as change in overall dps, but what I see is that while the change in that is dramatic on your sheet you still value passive haste items higher than other items.<br>
<br>
One example of what I mean is that the other spreadsheet gives me only a very modest increase using swiftstrike shoulders over deathmantle, while yours is roughly double the dps increase (yes i mean change in rough dps not the numbers next to the item).  I guess my question is what differences are there between the passive haste calculations and the TSD, if any, or is it possibly just the proc rate is calculated significantly differently?  I understood it to be 1ppm per the other sheet.<br>
<br>
Almost forgot. Did you make changes to reduce ppm items/enchants etc as per last patch? I was curious to know what type of hit mongoose took from that lil nerf.</div>

3) That was just a shot in the dark really, in case you had run into it before.  The descrepancies bother me. Without a reason as to why it makes it difficult to explicitly trust either source.  <br>

Also: I'm currently using the WSC and Abacus for my trinkets, and according to the spreadsheet, Romulo's Poison Vial would be a small upgrade over the Abacus.  Is this really true if one already meets the hit cap?  The Vial would allow me to re-gem some of my gear away from +hit, adding 28 agility, but it's hard to believe that and the Vial's seemingly-weak proc are better than a static 64 AP and haste buff every two minutes.  I'm not sure how to work out the mathematics, unfortunately, but it might be worth double-checking in the sheet?</div>

		<div id="post_message_496824">I've considered the Assassination armor a couple of times, but what I arrive at every time I look at it is: there's just not much reason to wear most of the pieces.  There's generally at least 2 items in the sheet that are better and can be gotten with comparable effort.  This is not to say that there's not some unlucky people that are stuck using it, but I don't think it's worth including on the basis of the less-than-1% case of people who have failed to get all reasonable alternatives.<br>
<br>
Regarding RPV:  If you are actually going to benefit from the hit (either directly or via regemming), it tends to be worth using. It's true that the proc is not ridiculously powerful, but it's nonnegligble and, more to the point: it just has a lot of hit on it.  35 hit is already worth 90-100 AP, depending on your exact itemization, and when you factor in the proc as well, it tends to cruise past the pre-Kara trinkets with ease.<br>
<br>
It should be noted, however, than RPV will suffer a bit of a nerf from the revisions in the next version of the sheet, so it's probably not quite *as* strong as currently reported.  So if it's a question of "should I spend 300g regemming for a 30 AP benefit), I might wait until we see what the new numbers look like.</div>

Summary is that, yes that would be similar to a longer cycle, the less rupture dps is made up by higher rupture uptime.<br>
<br>
EDIT:  I also just realized that depending on the fight it might be much better, as it would perform much better in fights with many interuptions.</div>

		<div id="post_message_497976">So I was trying to talk to some rogues tonite and all I got was scoffs and pissed off demeanor when I told them to stop using evis and use rupture.  <br>
<br>
This was the math he posted:<br>
<br>
<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px">

		overflow: auto">This is pulled from the WoW forums when all the discussion came out.  We'll go with 2500 AP, 30% crit.  30 is right for me....AP is usually a bit higher when you average mongoose procs out.  Always assuming we have a battle shout bitch.

Evis
-----
AP Modifier = 2500 * 5 * .03 = 375
Eviscerate = 1045 + 375 = 1420 avg noncrit, no talents 
2 piece tier5 bonus: 1420+200 = 1620   (Hellfiller)
Improved Eviscerate + Aggression: 1620 * 1.15 * 1.06 = 1975 avg noncrit before armor mit
Crits: 1975 * (1 + 0.3 crit) = 2568 avg dmg again before armor mit

I had a 2973 on Leo tonight with 5 sunders up.  With the AP I had it tells me he has &lt; 20% mit.  That puts avg evis dmg for him at 2054 or better.


Rupture
-----------
AP Modifier = 2500 * 0.24 = 600
Rupture = 1000 + 600 = 1600 dmg
w/ Mangle = 2080 dmg  -  rarely ever in our raids


2054 &gt; 1600.  Barely different if you have Mangle.  Obviously none of us have Serrated Blades.  If Squeep does then yes he should be using Rupture.</pre>
</div><br>
He's using 2500 ap as his base, with 30% crit (which is about average for us).  We don't have a feral druids mangle on the boss as of late.  Also, dont take into account any passive armor penetration.   If possible, could someone show me the post with the me math or do the math using those stats for a general boss?  "Tidewalker or FLK would be fine"</div>

		<div id="post_message_497988">So, a couple of key mistakes in that math:<br>
<br>
1) 20% mitigation from armor is only feasible assuming a) a low-armor boss initially, b) Faerie Fire and Curse of Recklessness are both up.  Which, admittedly, is true some of the time.  However, it is not true all of the time, and in all other circumstances, Eviscerate should be more heavily mitigated.<br>
<br>
2) 2500 AP strikes me as awfully low for raid-buffed SSC rogues, and a higher AP will favor rupture.<br>
<br>
3) And most importantly, the fact that Eviscerate costs 10 extra energy is totally neglected, and it is this, more than anything, that gives rise to the superiority of Rupture.  Yes, a single Evis can do more damage than a single rupture; however, the rupture saves 10 energy that can be used to some other end, such as an additional Sinister Strike every 4 ruptures.  Assuming, say, Talon as your MH, a SS with 2500 AP 30% crit a SS does about 1275 unmitigated, or, at 20% mitigation as cited, our 1/4 of a SS adds 255 damage (and 1/4 of a combo point, which further increases the size of the *next* finisher...), which closes the stated gap considerably.<br>
<br>
If you'd like to see an alternative analysis of the situation, I would refer you to post 645 where, conveniently, I have already done these calculations.</div>

With the 10 energy extra, and an avg 1100 ss/4 = 275 dmg which still leaves around 175 dmg left up in the air, in favor of talented Evisc.  I would suspect that imp poisons would make up a lot of that on a normal bossfight...<br>

<br>
I know the hitcap is at 308 with Weapon Expertise but what is the hitcap without Weapon Expertise? and what is the hitcap with Weapon Expertise and human racial?<br>
<br>
So from what I've read after the first 5 points of weapon skill it drops in value, does the spreadsheet take this into consideration? And if not, is Belt of One-Hundred Death really worth it compared to Belt of Deep Shadow for a human rogue?<br>
<br>
Have looked around for an answear and it's probably around somewhere but I've missed it, so I would be grateful if I got some helps.<br>

Looked at that just a moment ago, and that doesnt show the 30% mitigation on a boss that aldriana posted in post 645.  You posted 30%, which on most bosses that are not high-armor, you're looking at around 25% with 5sa (which ever raid will have just about). I also noticed, on the numbers based were not the avg Eviscerate base dmg, but the low end.<br>
<br>
I'm going to copy and paste Aldriana's previous information:<br>
<br>
A 5 point eviscerate does <b>1045</b> + .15*AP raw damage; with the aforementioned 3k AP, this works out to <b>1495</b> damage. 2/5 will raise this to <b>1695</b>. With 3/3 Imp Eviscerate and 3/3 Aggression (which is sort of a rare talent spec, but we'll go with it), this is increased by a further 21% to <b>2051</b>  damage. Based on the crit rate in the sheet, for me, 32.6% of those eviscerates will crit; hence, total damage from the eviscerate is <b>2720</b> damage. This is, however, mitigated by armor, <b>WAIT</b>.  Most of the armor bosses we face have around 6200 armor (37% mitigation), but if you include 5SA, as the poster does, that lowers the armor to 3600 or 25.5% mitigation, not nearly the 30.5% you posted previously.  That would bring the avg dmg up to <b>2039</b><br>
<br>
**Bold items were "fixed" by me to include the avg. evisc base dmg, instead of only the low-end as well as the proper armor mitigation 6200 (37%) - 2600 for 5SA which almost all raids have which comes to 3600 armor for most bosses (25.5%, not 30%).<br>
<br>
<br>
True, you would have to add the 271dmg of the avg SS's back in (See post #645 if anyone doesnt follow), but even then, rupture, on avg of an unmangled target, would only do, including the SS dmg, 1720 + 271 = 1991 (which would possibly be higher since less armor for the SS to be mitigated by).  <br>
<br>
I do this not to prove anyone wrong, rather to show how close evisc CAN BE, and if stacked with enough armor pen, raids buffs (CoR and imp FF), I think it comes out to more dmg tbh.  Looking at it now, the difference is 48 Dmg on avg in favor of Eviscerate.  The problem is, you are losing vile poisons to gain the imp eviscerate dmg and calculating in 2/5 T5 to help this dmg out.  So the 10 more energy you have to spend for 48dmg is amazingly un-worth it, not to mention the difference in your poisons.<br>
<br>
Also, if anyone sees fallacies or incorrect math, please tell me, I freaking hate when I mess stuff like that up.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">So from what I've read after the first 5 points of weapon skill it drops in value, does the spreadsheet take this into consideration? And if not, is Belt of One-Hundred Death really worth it compared to Belt of Deep Shadow for a human rogue?</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</div>The first 5 points of Weapon Skill are indeed more valuable than the later ones; this subtlety is not included in the sheet (and intentionally so).  For purposes of this sheet, weapon skill is modeled according to our best guess on how it works for weapon skill 355 and higher.  Hence, while the numbers in the sheet for weapon skill items might be incorrect if you don't have any +weapon skill from racials, gear, and talents, it is correct in most other cases.  In particular, Belt of One Hundred deaths is correctly modeled for a human rogue so, according to the best information we have available at this time, One-Hundred Deaths is slightly better than Deep Shadow. It's not a huge difference, but it is better.<br>

</div>1) I'm pretty sure I worked it out and Eviscerate's average damage is, in fact, 985.  I'll doublecheck it when I get home tonight.<br>

2) The only place where "most" bosses have 6200 armor is Hyjal, and, admittedly, for these low-armor bosses it might indeed make sense to use Eviscerate... if you happen to be specced for it, *and* have 2/5 T5, *and* have no feral druid in your raid.  However, the majority of bosses in SSC/TK/BT have 7700 armor, which, post-sunders and faerie fire, is 4600 armor, which works out to 30.3% mitigation.

Since we're assuming 2/5 T5, I'm going to say it's more likely than not that the 2/5 T4 will not be present as well.  There will certainly be some people with both, but most likely more that do not.  Hence, the optimal eviscerate cycle is something on the order of 4s5e, which takes roughly 26 seconds to complete.  In this 26 seconds, the 3 points in vile poisons that a rupturing rogue will have in place if ImpEvis will contribute 9 dps, or a total of 234 additional poison damage, which blows away whatever benefit Eviscerate might have possessed.</div>

</div>Wouldn't that be the same as 6x the +2 damage ring?  The cheap way to calculate it would be to put your equipment in the spreadsheet; take 6x the ring enchant and add 1.22 the value of one point in Malice.  By just adding (or subtracting) these 2 items/talents and multiplying and adding, you should have the answer specific to your build and equipment.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Well, this sheet doesn't model Sharpening Stones at all, under the assumption that they're inferior to poison. I confess I haven't actually worked through the math recently, but I'm reasonably confident in their inferiority.<br>
<br>
Rough estimate: Instant Poison, untalented, adds an average of 34 damage per hit to your attacks. Sharpening stones add 12, plus 1.22% crit, mitigated by armor. Assuming, say, 20% mitigation, your individual attacks would need to be hitting for roughly 2500 damage noncrit in order for the stone to do more. Which, I think, it's safe to say that none of us are quite their yet.</div>

</div>Hmm, slightly bogus calculation there.  A sharpening stone on your offhand increases crit rate for your main hand, off hand, specials and even your poisons, so it's not the individual attack damage that matters.<br>
<br>
What you actually mean is that for the stone to do more, you need to be doing 2500 damage (from all sources) per offhand hit. Now, with a 1.4 speed offhand, S'n'D, plus other haste buffs, yoru offhand will hit something like once per second, which makes the maths convenient.<br>
<br>
Thus, the tipping point where a sharpening stone becomes better than IP on your offhand is at around 2500 DPS.  Not there for any but the top 1 or 2 rogues worldwide, but with Sunwell gear it's actually a possiblity.</div>

</div>I was hoping no one would notice that, because I was trying to finesse past that point.  Yes, it's true, a single damage stone affects crit on both hands.  However, it's also true that a single crit stone only gives .61% crit, not 1.22%; that calculation was based on having crit stones on both weapons and then looking at the damage from both, which is, of course, somewhat of a bogus way of doing it due to the fact that the stone is more valuable OH than it is MH.  However, in terms of approximating the value, it seemed to me to be in the right ballpark.<br>
<br>
If you're going to do the approximation that you're working off of, you need to work off .61% crit instead, which doubles the DPS requirement to 5k.  Not that I think that's a particularly accurate way of measuring it either.<br>
<br>
In terms of a better approximation, a little spreadsheet hacking reveals a gear/buff combination that results in 2230 buffed DPS (or so), yet MH Weapon Stone only adds 27 DPS, and OH 21.  Compare to, for instance, OH Deadly Poison that does 84 DPS.  Or MH WF which does, um, a lot.<br>
<br>
Point being: I don't see stones being useful in the forseeable future.</div>

</div>Yes, I also have a stack of sharpening stones on me for whenever I bump into immune bosses aka hydross, VR. Not that we need it, but I just want highest dps available.<br>

I'd be happy to see them added if you ever reconsider. But as a stone user, I agree they aren't of any use except for these bosses.<br>

</div>So, first off: grats on the warglaives.  I think I speak for most of us when I say: /jealous<br>
<br>
Second: Thanks for taking the time to take some data.<br>
<br>
In terms of actual analysis: I show 94 periods of Warglaive uptime in that combatlog, and 5265 total hits.  Grinding through the data, we find that of those 94 periods of uptime, there are 19 at least 11 seconds in length, including 5 at least 21 seconds in length, and 1 that is more than 31 seconds in length.  Hence, there were, at minimum 122 distinct haste procs in the data set.  In reality, there may have been a few more, but lets go with the 122 number for the moment.<br>
<br>
122 procs in 5265 total hits works out to a proc rate of roughly 2.32% on the test, with a standard deviation of .21%; hence, if it's a fixed percent proc, the true value lies between 1.91% and 2.72%.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, it might be a PPM effect; were it 1 PPM, one would expect to see 156 procs in that data set; since only 122 were observed, I think it somewhat unlikely that it's 1 PPM; it would need to be .8 PPM or so instead.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, due to the nature of the set, it's going to be hard to isolate the hands and figure out which hand procced what; hence figuring out the exact proc mechanics is going to be challenging.  I can think of two pieces of data that might be helpful in determining it for certain:<br>
<br>
1) If one stands sidewise to a mob, it is possible to find a position wherein you can still land specials on the mob, but not autoattack it.  A data set of this sort, where there are no autoattacks present but only SS (or Shiv, your choice) spam, should be able to isolate one hand from the other.<br>
<br>
2) Attacking the mob normally, but with using SS and SnD instead of straight autoattack.  If it's a PPM effect, SnD will reduce the proc rate; if it's a fixed percent, it will not.  This would provide some insight as to what sort of proc we're dealing with.<br>
<br>
What we *can* say from this is that the set bonus is still sickeningly powerful, even with the haste nerf.</div>

Prior to 2.2, Dragonspine was indeed a larger upgrade than Talon; in fact, Dragonspine by itself provided an upgrade rivaling all SSC + TK loot put together (relative to their T4/Karazhan/Heroic counterparts).<br>
<br>
With the nerf to Dragonspine (which will be reflected in 0.8, whenever I get around to finishing it), it will still be quite a significant upgrade over Romulo's, and, hence, among the more important upgrades for a rogue to get; however, it will no longer be far and away the largest upgrade, and it will, for instance, be a smaller upgrade than Talon.<br>
<br>
As for why the other sheet differs: I don't know if they have implemented the Dragonspine nerf yet; if they had, that is probably at least part of the difference.  Beyond that, I would refer you the Frequently Asked Questions section of the first post in this thread.</div>

As for when the next version is ready: hard to say.  I was hoping to have it out by now, but I got rather busy with work and various other commitments.  Looking down my to-do list of changes, there's still several hours of work that needs to be done - it's simply a matter of when I can find time to bang through this list.  Sometime early next week is possible; failing that, hopefully next weekend.  But, as always: no promises.</div>

<br>
After 2.2, has the value of the Abacus dropped below that of the Card? Shadowpanther lists both Abacus and Hourglass a bit higher than the card, so if I can just get those and actually be better off, then I wont bother using the Deck and just sell it.</div>

		<div id="post_message_501270">For purely sustained fights, Crusade beats Abacus by about 10 AP.  However, Crusade takes about 10 seconds to stack up, meaning that for fights that are less than a minute in length - or fights where you suffer interruptions 10 seconds in length at least once a minute, on average - Abacus wins, even neglecting the fact that Abacus is improved by interrupted fights.  So if you're doing 25-man raid bosses that are frequently this length or longer, Crusade is probably better than Abacus.  Of course, if you're doing 25 man raid bosses, you should have access to trinkets that are a fair amount better than either.  But if you're just doing 5-mans or Karazhan, Crusade is probably less worthwhile.<br>
<br>
So, all in all: if you have the money to spend, there's certainly a place for it.  But it's not a huge upgrade, and, depending on what you're doing, it may not be an upgrade at all.<br>

I did another test for you, this time using SnD (I got lazy halfway through and switched from 3s/5r to 5s/5r because SnD was dropping when I got unlucky with ruthlessness and relentless strikes, hopefully that doesn't affect anything though) and for 28 minutes as opposed to one hour due to time constraints.<br>

p.s. The logs are a double whammy because I also had Madness of the Betrayer equipped, so you can also parse the data for Forceful Strikes to find out if anything changed with it or not.</div>

<br>
Also, I have another mechanics question for you fine people: does anyone know how Improved Hunter's Mark works?  The spell description on thottbot reads:<br>
<br>
"Places the Hunter's Mark on the target, increasing the ranged attack power of all attackers against that target by 110 and by an additional 11 each time they are struck by a ranged attack, up to a maximum of 440."<br>
<br>
The talent reads:<br>
<br>
"Causes 100% of your Hunter's Mark ability's base attack power to apply to melee attack power as well"<br>
<br>
So my question is: is "base attack power" just the 110?  Or do we get the benefit up to 440?  And in the latter case, how long does it take to stack up (aka, how frequently do hunters land ranged attacks?   1/second?  More than that?)<br>
<br>
Finally a question for uhohzombies:  I could figure it out myself, but in the interest of saving time: were you wearing 2/5 T6 for that test? i.e., is that 30% SnD, or 35% SnD?</div>

At low itemization levels (like, preKara) shiv/envenom does okay, but it scales very poorly such that by the time you're talking late T5 and beyond, it's obviously inferior.<br>

		<div id="post_message_501984">Actually I think it's the opposite.  If we look at the WWS data for the Anetheron kill.<br>
White damage was constant in both, 64% of overall damage.<br>
Shiv did 18% (96,000).<br>
Sinister strike did 25% (115,000).<br>
Envenom did 10% and 52,500 damage during the fight.<br>
Rupture did 5% and 24,700 damage during the fight.<br>
<br>
Now as you can see, Shiv only did 20,000 less than Sinister Strike.  But Envenom did 28k more damage than Rupture.<br>
<br>
Looking at the individual damage of Envenom and Rupture.  Rupture average ticks for 280, which means on average a full duration Rupture was doing 2240 damage.  Envenom non-crits average 2178 and crits average 4386.<br>

		<div id="post_message_501998">Sure, in raw numbers.  But lets look at percentages, which are more illustrative:<br>
<br>
Shive + Evenom did 28%.<br>
Rupture + SS did 30%<br>
<br>
So, while the raw amount of damage might be higher for Shiv/Envenom, the total amount of damage done was higher as well; hence, assuming white damage is relatively constant between the two builds (which should be a safe assumption), the dps contribution of CPGs and finishers is lower with the shiv/envenom build, meaning it's overall dps contribution is lower, hence the overall DPS is lower.<br>
<br>
I'd also like to note that I don't consider WWS of fights shorter than half an hour as indicative of anything; there's just to much variation, particularly in a 5 min fight like Anetheron.  Samples need to be large enough so as to be statistically significant, or supported by theory, before they're particularly interesting.<br>
<br>
Regardless, it's not really germane to this discussion anyway, since this sheet could not easily be adapted to do shiv cycles, so even if I did think it was a competitive cycle (and I don't) I'd make a separate shiv sheet rather than modifying this one.<br>
<br>
Edit: as an example of what I mean by variance, it should be noted that, for instance, the SS trial only had a 25% crit rate on SS (versus ~35% crit for autoattacks in both trials), and Envenom had a 50% crit rate in that test.  The fact that rupture was ticking for 10% more damage in the Shiv/Evis test makes suspect unequal buffs (or unequal proc uptime) as well.  Any results that might be gleaned from this are thus buried in the statistical noise.</div>

<br>
In other news:<br>
<br>
I ground the Warglaive data this morning, and man, this is a tough cookie to crack.<br>
<br>
In the initial data set, there were 5265 attacks, and 119 procs (there was a bug in my program which generated the above numbers; hence the 119 number is correct).  This means that, if it's a fixed-percent proc, we can say with 95% confidence that the true proc rate is between 1.86% and 2.66%.  Grinding through all the haste effects, we find that there would be an expected 156 procs of a 1 PPM effect in a data set this size; Hence, if it's a PPM, it's somewhere around .75 PPM<br>
<br>
In the SnD/Rupture data, there are 3393 attacks and 71 procs.  This means that, if it's a fixed-percent proc, we can say with 95% confidence that the true proc rate is between 1.61% and 2.57%.  Grinding through the haste effects + SnD, we find that a 1 PPM effect would expect to go off about 106 times in a data set this size; hence, if it's a PPM, it's somewhere around .67 PPM<br>
<br>
So, from this data, we can say: the proc rate is somewhere in the 1.8%-2.6% range, or it's a PPM effect around .67-.75 PPM.<br>
<br>
In the SS-only data, there were 9 procs in 298 swings; hence, the proc rate is somewhere between 1.08% and 4.96% with 95% confidence.   This includes both the fixed-% range (1.8-2.6), and the PPM range (3.1-3.5) - so we can't really say much.<br>
<br>
Long story short: need more data.  I suspect the SS-Only testing is gonna be the best way to pin this down, but it's gonna take a really big (like, several hours) data set to tell the difference, I'm afraid.  Unless people are feeling really ambitious with the testing, we may have to just punt on it and take our best guess.... if they're this hard to tell apart, it probably won't be *too* inaccurate to just pick one and go with it.</div>

<br>
I've used the Rogue DPS Spreadsheet quite extensively to fine-tune my gear and build, and was a little surprised to find that as 19/42/0 combat swords rogue, I would get more DPS out of 1/5 Lethality and 4/5 Imp Poisons rather than a full 5/5 Lethality.  I like the Imp Poisons talent for PvP and Arenas, and the fact that it would also increase my sustained DPS was great.  However, selecting this combination of talents on the Rogue Gear Spreadsheet caused my optimal hit rating to skyrocket from 261 to 337.  <br>
<br>
Am I doing something wrong, or is this talent being incorrectly used in the spreadsheet?  I fail to see how less critical strike damage bonus would affect optimal hit in such a drastic manner.<br>

		<div id="post_message_502794">From the FAQ in the first post of this thread:<br>
<br>
"Q: What does "Optimal Hit" mean?<br>
A: Optimal Hit reflects the amount of hit rating if you socketed and enchanted your current gear optimally. For exactly what is considered to be optimal for you, consult the middle gear column. Optimal Hit *doesn't* have anything to do with the hit cap - is just an indication of how much hit you'd have if you socketed according to the recommendations in the middle column. This is primarily intended as a warning mechanism, as, in general, "optimal" involves socketing stuff with a whole lot of +8 hit gems, which will frequently put you over the hit cap - the Optimal Hit number is designed to warn you about this so you know not to socket so overwhelmingly with hit."<br>
<br>
So, what's happening is: with lethality, agi is better than hit for you, so it's recommending socketing most things with +agi; as such, the total hit in the optimal socketing of your gear is 261.  If you remove a point from Lethality and put it in Improved Poisons, this lowers the value of the crit you get from agility, such that hit becomes a better stat and it becomes better to socket all your gear with +hit, causing the total hit on the optimal socketing of your gear to skyrocket.<br>
<br>
I would be a little cautious about taking Imp Poisons over Lethality, since a) not all mobs are poisonable, but Lethality works on everything, and b) if you have access to Windfury on a somewhat regular basis, Imp Poisons contributes (effectively) no DPS at all (although Vile Poisons still gives a modest increase).</div>

		<div id="post_message_502825">Thanks very much for the clarification.  I read the initial post with the FAQ, but didn't realize that the 4 points in Lethality changed the optimal socketing so significantly.<br>
<br>
I understand that from a pure PvE standpoint, Lethality will win out when I'm fully raid buffed.  However, since I'm in a small guild, I'm not likely to do much outside of 10 man raiding.  I chose Imp Poisons primarily for Arenas to stack Wound Poison faster, and Lethality has lost some of its effectiveness to resilience.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">As a sword rogue, 2/5 T4 doesn't actually do a whole lot.  A lot of people like it because it makes life easier, but in terms of actual damage output it just doesn't do much.  Hence, while 4/5 T5 is somewhat overvalued in the current version, I'd be willing to bet a fair amount of money that you'll see a damage increase by going to 4/5 T5.<br>
<br>
In other news:<br>
<br>
I ground the Warglaive data this morning, and man, this is a tough cookie to crack.<br>
<br>
In the initial data set, there were 5265 attacks, and 119 procs (there was a bug in my program which generated the above numbers; hence the 119 number is correct).  This means that, if it's a fixed-percent proc, we can say with 95% confidence that the true proc rate is between 1.86% and 2.66%.  Grinding through all the haste effects, we find that there would be an expected 156 procs of a 1 PPM effect in a data set this size; Hence, if it's a PPM, it's somewhere around .75 PPM<br>
<br>
In the SnD/Rupture data, there are 3393 attacks and 71 procs.  This means that, if it's a fixed-percent proc, we can say with 95% confidence that the true proc rate is between 1.61% and 2.57%.  Grinding through the haste effects + SnD, we find that a 1 PPM effect would expect to go off about 106 times in a data set this size; hence, if it's a PPM, it's somewhere around .67 PPM<br>
<br>
So, from this data, we can say: the proc rate is somewhere in the 1.8%-2.6% range, or it's a PPM effect around .67-.75 PPM.<br>
<br>
In the SS-only data, there were 9 procs in 298 swings; hence, the proc rate is somewhere between 1.08% and 4.96% with 95% confidence.   This includes both the fixed-% range (1.8-2.6), and the PPM range (3.1-3.5) - so we can't really say much.<br>
<br>
Long story short: need more data.  I suspect the SS-Only testing is gonna be the best way to pin this down, but it's gonna take a really big (like, several hours) data set to tell the difference, I'm afraid.  Unless people are feeling really ambitious with the testing, we may have to just punt on it and take our best guess.... if they're this hard to tell apart, it probably won't be *too* inaccurate to just pick one and go with it.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</div>I have to admit, the thought of sitting in my chair for several hours hitting sinister strike in the Blasted Lands isn't too appealing. One thing I can attest to is the proc rate is obscene. The proc rate "feels"(non-scientific hehe) to be on par with the DST pre-nerf and given that it gives 450 haste rating as opposed to 325 and has no internal cooldown, it would be safe to say that it is as powerful, if not more so, as a pre-nerf DST.<br>
<br>
By the way, I forgot to mention that I accidentally left the DST in for the SnD testing. Could that have tainted the data in any way? If so, I can redo that test without any other haste coming into play.</div>

Actually, though, at this point my program is getting sophisticated enough that I can probably glean some information from less controlled testing.  If you want to just combatlog an entire night of raiding and send it to me, I'll see if I can work some magic on it.<br>
<br>
Edit: Updated numbers for the SnD Test:  A 1 PPM enchant would be expected to fire about 102 times; hence the measured proc rate is more like .7 PPM rather than .67 PPM.<br>
<br>
Additional note: 95% confidence interval on procs of a 1 PPM enchant would be 83 to 121 procs; hence 71 procs is most likely not a 1 PPM effect.<br>
<br>
Additional additional note: if you're going to provide data from an actual raid, the one thing that will mess me up is if you have multiple haste effects of the same name; hence, for best data, if you're going to use DST, it would be helpful if you could refrain from using Haste Pots.</div>

I don't think anyone really questions the fact that Murder is superior to Ruthlessness on those mobs that are affected by it; however, since not all mobs are, people tend to prefer the less powerful but always applicable Ruthlessness.  In SSC/TK, for instance, while many of the bosses are affected by Murder, there are any number of important adversaries that are not (Hydross, Void Reaver, Al'ar, Vashj's elementals, Kael's weapons, possibly Leotheras in demon form (although I'd have to check that), and so on.<br>

On the whole, though, I agree that in SSC/TK, Murder is likely more worthwhile.  However, as one moves into the T6 instances, the points in Ruthlessness will become superior.</div>

</div>I found Coup de Grace quite powerful. There were times when I would get 6-8 free finishers in a row; it felt like a mini-AR. However it does take a fair amount of concentration to use optimally. You have to be careful to avoid energy overflow, especially with lag. If you are comfortable mixing and matching cycles on the fly, I recommend it. But keep in mind that there is an inevitable loss of game awareness in getting the most out of it.</div>

We rogues can get 2 weapons, the sword and the dagger. What would be the best weaponchoice for us there? Normaly I wield Merciless Gladiator's Slicer (MH) + Merciless Gladiator's Quickblade (OH). <br>
Wielding 2 legendaries with 122 dps looks great at first sight but being swordspec I fear I would be best off with the Warp Slicer (MH) and my normal arena S2 offhand.  <br>
<br>
So what would be best? I tried inputting the legendaries into the spreadsheet but when adding the weaps it seems to work but when I change it's name I get a divide by 0 error so I'm guessing I'm screwing it up somewhere. <br>
<br>
So my question.. what would be best?<br>
1) Warp Slicer (MH) + Infinity Blade (OH)<br>
2) Warp Slicer (MH) + Merciless Gladiator's Quickblade (OH)<br>
3) some other combo<br>
<br>
My thoughts: <br>
1) 2 legendaries can't be bad right? No OH swordprocs though<br>
2) Legendary sword with best swordspec procs due to fast OH<br>
3) seriously doubt any other combo can be better</div>

Infinity Blade is a 122 DPS, 2.0 speed weapon.<br>
Quickblade is a 97 DPS, 1.5 speed weapon.<br>
<br>
As a rule of thumb, each .1 OH speed is worth about 10 DPS.  Hence, Infinity Blade is as good as a 72 dps 1.5 speed weapon.  Infinity Blade is also not a sword, and while it's stat mods are somewhat superior, it's not nearly enough to make up the difference.

However, 1 person can keep the debuff up on the boss with east, so if, for instance, the MT is tanking with Infinity Blade, the proc does nothing.<br>

Hence, what I usually do is run Infinity Blade MH, Quickblade OH, and do most of the fight like that.

</div>It would be a bit foolosh to ruin your dps for a few stabs to de-MC someone. <br>
Anyway, I guess you all agree with my feeling that a fast OH sword is better then a slow legendary dagger with ~20% more dps.  Guess that will be what I'll be nuking with from now on.<br>
<br>
And yes the dagger is needed for de-MC'ing.. but you want to do that with ONLY the dagger anyway so you'll need to macro it anyway. Just using dagger OH or MH with another legendary is way to risky if they get unlucky and resets a few stabs <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080430210539im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":)" class="inlineimg"><!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">From the FAQ in the first post of this thread:<br>
<br>
"Q: What does "Optimal Hit" mean?<br>
A: Optimal Hit reflects the amount of hit rating if you socketed and enchanted your current gear optimally. For exactly what is considered to be optimal for you, consult the middle gear column. Optimal Hit *doesn't* have anything to do with the hit cap - is just an indication of how much hit you'd have if you socketed according to the recommendations in the middle column. This is primarily intended as a warning mechanism, as, in general, "optimal" involves socketing stuff with a whole lot of +8 hit gems, which will frequently put you over the hit cap - the Optimal Hit number is designed to warn you about this so you know not to socket so overwhelmingly with hit."</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</div>Aye.  Is there any prospect of changing your calculations of gemming to make them worth something?  When I'm trying to decide between rigid dawnstones and glinting topaz in my yellow sockets, it is no use whatsoever to tell me that rigid dawnstone is better if you ignore the fact that hit is capped.  Heck, it will even tell me to socket more rigid dawnstones <i>when I'm already over the hit cap</i>.  Right now I'm sitting at 307 hit rating, and it's telling me to rip out my +12 crit stone and put in a +8 hit stone. <br>
<br>
It's simply not fit for purpose with regard to gemming - you might as well rip out that whole subsection of the sheet, because none of it is believable.  And if it applies to gems - surely it applies to all other gear recommendations also?  If it naively thinks that hit is always better even when you're past the hit cap, it will recommend distinctly suboptimal gear based on the (useless) hit rating.<br>
<br>
It's simple to test this: I took my current gear set and just put +8 hit in all gem sockets.  That brings my to (capped) 308 hit rating with one empty trinket slot.

				<div style="font-style:italic">Aye.  Is there any prospect of changing your calculations of gemming to make them worth something?  When I'm trying to decide between rigid dawnstones and glinting topaz in my yellow sockets, it is no use whatsoever to tell me that rigid dawnstone is better if you ignore the fact that hit is capped.  Heck, it will even tell me to socket more rigid dawnstones <i>when I'm already over the hit cap</i>.  Right now I'm sitting at 307 hit rating, and it's telling me to rip out my +12 crit stone and put in a +8 hit stone. <br>
<br>
It's simply not fit for purpose with regard to gemming - you might as well rip out that whole subsection of the sheet, because none of it is believable.  And if it applies to gems - surely it applies to all other gear recommendations also?  If it naively thinks that hit is always better even when you're past the hit cap, it will recommend distinctly suboptimal gear based on the (useless) hit rating.<br>
<br>
It's simple to test this: I took my current gear set and just put +8 hit in all gem sockets.  That brings my to (capped) 308 hit rating with one empty trinket slot.  For that trinket slot, it recommends Romulo's poison vial over Bloodlust Brooch, despote the fact that the only thing I'd actually get from the vial is the weak poison proc.<br>

</div>The recommendations aren't supposed to be taken that seriously. All they do is narrow down your choices for certain slots or sockets.<br>
To find out what's best, you select one item after another and look at the DPS cell (B4) after every change as the DPS calculations factor in the Hit limit. The items and gems that yield the highest amount of DPS are the ones you want to equip.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_504264"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->The issue is, I'm not trying to make a sheet that will tell you what to do.  I am trying to make a sheet to tell you what is good.  And whether you are at the hit cap or not, an item with a lot of hit on it is good.  You may or may not be able to make use of the fact that it's good at this particular moment in time, but it is, in an abstract sense, good.<br>
<br>
For instance, lets say the sheet set the value of hit to zero and thereby stopped recommending it the instant you got to the hit cap.  Lets also suppose that Blizzard then released a trinket with 100 hit rating on it.<br>
<br>
Now, how good is this item in an abstract sense?  Well, really damn good, obviously; it means you can stop socketing for hit at all and dump all that itemization into other stats, and still be hit capped.  The actual long-term benefit you get from having such a trinket is large.  So clearly, this item can reasonably be defined as "good", and we want the spreadsheet to let us know that this is an item worth getting.<br>
<br>
<b>But</b>, under the assumption that the sheet would stop recommending hit the moment you were hit capped, if you were hit capped at the time, the sheet would never tell you about this item.  And for as long as you were hit capped, you would think that this 100 hit item is crap, purely because you can't currently make use of it.<br>
<br>
Stated briefly: the purpose of this sheet is not to replace independent thought.  The purpose of this sheet is not to tell you exactly what you should equip.  And even if that was the purpose of the sheet, it would not be reasonable to expect that all upgrades suggested by the sheet can be made in any order without running into trouble.  The purpose of the sheet is to provide you, the user, with information about what is good... and not.  Armed with the knowledge that certain items are good, and certain items are not, it is left to you, the user, to decide how best to realize the benefit of the good items.<br>
<br>
To be perfectly honest, the very earliest versions of this sheet did detect the hit cap.  When one's miss rate reached zero, the value of hit promptly dropped to zero.  And every time it happened, it confused the heck out of me.   I'd be trying out equipment options, fiddling things around - and it would abruptly inform me that everything I was wearing was crap, and that just about anything I could get my hands on would be an upgrade for every slot.  I found this incredibly confusing every time it happened, and figure, at that point, that if I, who *wrote* the stupid thing was getting confused by the behavior, there was no real chance of anyone else being able to make sense of it.  As such, I decided on the current approach, namely, continuing to inform you that items with a lot of hit on them are good, whether or not you can make use of the hit at the current time.<br>
<br>
With regard to socketing in particular: yes, it could stop recommending hit gems when you're at the hit cap.  But lets consider the implications of this.<br>
<br>
Say you have 260 hit on your gear, neglecting sockets, 10 available sockets, and none of the socket bonuses are worth getting.  Now, clearly socketing all 10 sockets with +8 hit gems is incorrect; this puts you at 340 hit.  <br>
<br>
Well, the first solution to this would be to  just not recommend hit if it puts you over the cap, and thus recommend all +8 agi gems.  But this isn't really the right answer; what we want it to do is recommend hit until you get to the cap, and then agi for the rest of the slots.  What we want it to do is socket 6 of the sockets with +8 hit (for a total of 308 hit) and the other 4 with 8 agi.<br>
<br>
Well, the first question with this is: how is the sheet supposed to decide which slots get 8 agi, and which get 8 hit?  Clearly, if there's socket bonuses on the line, you socket in accordance with those.  But, if there's not, which do you choose?  What goes where?  And, for the matter, why use 6 rigid and 4 delicate instead of 2 rigid and 8 glinting?  or 4 rigid, 4 glinting, and 2 delicate?  Or any other such combination?<br>
<br>
Clearly, there exist circumstances where there are multiple different equivalent ways of socketing stuff, without any particular reason to favor one over the other.  In this situation, the spreadsheet would have to define some convention by which it decided where to put them.  So, lets say the rule is, it starts from the top of the sheet, fills hit till it hits the hit cap, and then sockets the rest with agi.<br>
<br>
But this means, for instance, that the value of the sockets in your boots is going to change based on which helm your wearing, *EVEN IF* your overall stats wind up the same.  And I, for one, would find that horribly confusing.<br>
<br>
Hence, I went the other route.  When comparing the value of items, it assumes that each is socketed optimally.  The value of a socket does not depend on what order the sockets are filled; the sockets are always valued assuming the best possible contents.  This what the middle column tells you: "I believe that this is the best theoretically possible socketing of this item, and thus, to accurately assess the full potential of this item, I am going to compare it to other options based on this socketing".<br>
<br>
So, long story short: this sheet scores items off the maximal potential of each item.  Not all the potential can be realized by every rogue at every time; however, there are complications and confusions that make it more sensible to put the burden on the user to figure out the best solution to that, rather than trying to do it in the sheet.  The sheet is not the ultimate authority on all things; it is simply a tool to help you make good decisions.  But in the end, you are the one that must make the decisions.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
I count 6128 attacks and 137 procs.  Hence, if it's a fixed-percent proc, it's proc rate is between 1.87% and 2.61%.  If, on the other hand, it's PPM, it's about .73 PPM, as a 1 PPM enchant would expect to proc 188 times with a variance of 13 procs.<br>

</div>Hmm, fair enough - that's just a design philosophy difference.  Thing is, by making it "recommend" stuff, you're implying that those items (whether gems or actual items) really do offer an upgrade over existing kit.<br>
<br>
In the example you give, you want to choose whether to socket hit or agility.  I can use my intelligence to know that I shouldn't socket hit past the cap.  However with certain gear combinations, AP or crit might be better than agility.  Your sheet doesn't help me with that: it's too busy recommending the hit I <i>don't</i> need, and not giving me the information I <i>do</i> need (i.e. when I drop hit, should I replace it with agi, AP or crit?)<br>
<br>
And it's not just gem choices - especially as mudflation progresses, I wouldn't be surprised to see itemisation get to the point where +hit will be capped from your gear alone, without looking at gems.  And yet your spreadsheet will still recommend further gear with yet more +hit on, which swamps out the top of the list and thus doesn't show you the gear that might be a <i>real</i> upgrade for you.<br>
<br>
So finding upgrades becomes an immensely tedious process of swapping items in and out manually, and checking to see whether the calculated DPS goes up or down, while paying no attention to the actual recommendations.  This is (I submit) deeply counterintuitive.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>It's a question of gives and takes.  308 is the point you can't use more to hit, but when gear is stacked with loads of other useful stats (crit rating, agility, AP, etc) there comes a point that the hit rating-less gear is still overall better.  <br>
<br>
In other words, on a point-for-point basis, hit rating is better than agility, crit rating, or 2 AP, but item stats don't match up point-for-point.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

There seems to be a fair amount of such gear in the tier 5 and 6 instances. Deathmantle's 24 +hit is a large step down from the 81 +hit from Netherblade. It is not uncommon to drop down towards 200 hit rating, especially if you are progressing fast enough that your gear choices are limited by whatever drops.

Aldriana puts out a product for those of us with neither the time, the smarts, the expertise in statistics, or the inclination that simplifies the complicated process of gear itemization for rogues.  Also, the effort put into determining how items work (i.e. DST, WSC and other proc items.) is invaluable.  <br>
<br>
To chime in with criticism of the hard work and dedication Aldriana gives to the rogue community is kind of, to use your words, deeply counterintuitive.  If you feel the need to tell someone who puts in herculean time and effort to simplifying this process that they are wrong, come with more than "deeply counterintuitive".  Put in some time, effort, testing and programming of your own and come up with an alternative that is a possible solution to your issues with the work he has produced.  Don't just sit back and say, "I don't like this.  It seems like you could do better.  Fix it for me."<br>
<br>
I want to say just the opposite.  Aldriana, as always (and I think I speak for a lot of the rogue community) I am eternally in your debt for all the hard work and effort you put in. <br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I don't usually pipe in to conversations or threads unless I feel it is totally necessary.  This is one of those times.<br>
<br>
Aldriana puts out a product for those of us with neither the time, the smarts, the expertise in statistics, or the inclination that simplifies the complicated process of gear itemization for rogues.  Also, the effort put into determining how items work (i.e. DST, WSC and other proc items.) is invaluable.  <br>
<br>
To chime in with criticism of the hard work and dedication Aldriana gives to the rogue community is kind of, to use your words, deeply counterintuitive.  If you feel the need to tell someone who puts in herculean time and effort to simplifying this process that they are wrong, come with more than "deeply counterintuitive".  Put in some time, effort, testing and programming of your own and come up with an alternative that is a possible solution to your issues with the work he has produced.  Don't just sit back and say, "I don't like this.  It seems like you could do better.  Fix it for me."<br>
<br>
I want to say just the opposite.  Aldriana, as always (and I think I speak for a lot of the rogue community) I am eternally in your debt for all the hard work and effort you put in. <br>
<br>
Thanks for doing it.</div>

I am of the opinion that people could make serious mistakes by going over hit cap. Perhaps you could revert to the previous behaviour where you correctly accounted for hit cap in the rating system, but when you approach/exceed it, have a big bold warning message that activates? Yellow for ~10 close to hit cap, and Red if you exceed?<br>
<br>
*edit: P.S. thank you for the lovely spreadsheet. Your hard work is most certainly welcome. I had created my own fairly extensive spreadsheet pre-BC for my guild's use, and hadn't the time to revamp it for post-BC, and I know how much work it can be.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Always "try on" the gear you're contemplating and see if the rough dps numbers go up, or if you go over the hit cap, etc.  If you're using the sheet mindlessly, you're using it incorrectly.   There are multiple things that YOU need to be aware of - set bonuses, meta gem activation requirements, and the hit cap are the 3 main things to keep in mind that the sheet does not 'automatically' track.   And honestly, the hit cap thing is the one that is easiest to identify (with the red boxes).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Where is the point where you don't need hit? that is, I know 308 is the rating I'd need with combat. But most reasonably geared rogues I see have 280ish hit rating. Whats up with that?</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</div>First off: there's nothing fundamentally special about being at or near the hit cap; what matters is the total DPS granted by the stats on the items you have equipped.  Getting to the hit cap isn't particularly  more special than getting to 2k unbuffed AP or 30% unbuffed crit: in the end, it's just a number.  So if it turns out that your DPS will be better with less hit because you pick up enough agi/AP/crit/etc. to justify the loss: well, then, you're somewhat under the hit cap.<br>
<br>
Secondly: I personally prefer to keep my hit under 281, which is the hit cap for level 70s.  There is enough level 70 trash (and boss adds) to be killed that not wasting hit on them seems potentially advantageous.  Hence, while I don't actively dump hit to get below 281, nor do I specifically stack it to get above 281.<br>
<br>
Thirdly: while hit is optimal for sustained fights, for interrupted fights it doesn't perform quite as well.  Thus, there exists the school of thought that you might as well just socket for agility in the first place, and not worry as much about hit.  As a general rule, when there are two items of comparable sustained DPS output, it is generally advantageous to select the one with less hit.<br>
<br>
All in all: there are a number of good reasons why one might find oneself below the hit cap<br>
<br>
Regarding criticism: I would encourage people to post any criticism or feedback they may have.  If you don't like the way things work, say so.  It's entirely possible that what's bugging you is something that can be fixed.  And, if it's not, I will explain why it needs to be the way it is.  If you're a dick about it, I might just ignore you, but that's hardly the end of the world either.  Long story short?  Feel free to speak your mind.<br>
<br>

		<div id="post_message_504990"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->If you'd like to keep uploading parses, it certainly wouldn't hurt anything.  As for adding it to the spreadsheet: I can certainly put in a reasonable estimate, under the theory of "if it's this hard to tell the difference, how much difference can it actually make?"<br>
<br>
My take on the proc rate situation:<br>
<br>
It appears that the proc rate is most likely either a fixed 2.2% or .75 PPM.  Of those, it seems more plausible to me that it is .75 PPM, under both the "it's a nice round number" theory, and the "pretty much every proc in the game is a PPM" theory.<br>
<br>
So, my inclination is at this point to add it to the spreadsheet as a .75 PPM effect, and call it good for the moment.  If at some point down the road someone feels like doing the SS-only test in Blasted Lands (which, by my estimates, would take roughly 5 hours to be guaranteed to be able to distinguish between the options) it could be updated, but for the moment I'm inclined to say that .75 PPM is probably a good enough estimate.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

If it's true that haste effects no longer scale ppm effects, we should be able to separate out parses with haste active and see if the azinoth proc rate goes up.  If it does, it's % based, if not (given that we're outside of the standard error), it's ppm.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
The BT rogue exalted trinket combined with a decent amount of passive ArP with the off chance to self buff with the WsC and sitting at 20% hit after talents, is it worth having the BT exalted trinket?  Adding another question, has anyone used the Raid Boss ac chart and teh ArP dmg boost considered with a certain crit rate and ArP level could 2-pc Tier 5 evis bonus finally bring evis to a decent finisher?<br>
<br>
I feel it is easy to keep the buff up and my thought was that with the ArP dropping the boss armor the potential crits on both white and yellow attacks should happen that much for and should hit harder when the WsC procs.  I was not ever having issues with keeping SnD up nor using rupture in a timely fashion to keep the debuff constantly up.  My WWS reports will go up later today allowing me to compare from previous weeks but I was wondering if others may of already invested the time on this topic.  Thanks<br>

</div>Will do. I will edit this post later with the combat log for that test.<br>
<br>
It will be interesting to see how this new Weapon Skill to Expertise change in 2.3 will affect rogues. I'm worried about losing the +hit bonus from weapon skill as the patch notes only specify a .25% reduction in dodge and parry per point of expertise. Great for tanks, not so great for rogues if that's the case. Barring any changes to the precision talent, wouldn't that raise the hit cap across the board for all races to 363 or something like that? Frightening thought...<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_507028"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Well at first glance the New weapon expertise, looks like it will hurt.  being a human rogue I have 365 weapon skill naturally so the lose of hit will hurt, but it does look like as you get close to capping weapon expertise around 21 skill (I believe) it will be better 5% dodge reduction is nice. <br>
<br>
Basically it will come down to how much Hit will we need and at what cost to other stats.  That is where we will need to test. so basically sense we pretty well know how the current system works time to learn a whole new one :/<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_507170"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->* Re: Shadow-walker's Cord.  In 0.7.7, I think you're just in an unusual area of the gear space where it is actually that good.  In 0.8, there are significant changes being made that will drop it's value further.  It also should be noted that it only wins if you score it with BT gems off; if you allow the competing belts (all of which have 2 sockets) to be socketed with BT gems, Shadow-walker's no longer holds a clear lead.<br>
<br>
* Re: Band of the Eternal Champion.  Standard auto-attack test with one weapon (or two weapons of the same speed) would probably be ideal.  Doing tests at two different speeds (i.e., test with 2x1.3 speed weapons, and then do another test with 2x2.6 speed weapons) would also potentially be interesting.  The only reason why Warglaives needs the more complicated thing is the inability to test with a single weapon or two weapons of the same speed.<br>
<br>
* Re: Expertise.  Well, since they're telling us exactly what it does, I think the most important thing is going to be establish what the base miss and dodge rates of level 73s are.  This is going to involve stacking increasingly ludicrous amounts of +hit and fighting boss-level mobs until you stop missing.  Whether it will be possible to do the same with expertise and dodge rate remains to be seen; we'll have to see what itemization looks like.  Observations so far:<br>
<br>
1) Paladins weapon skill talent gives both expertise and stamina; it's entirely possible that WEx will give more than just Expertise.<br>
<br>
2) If it does just give expertise, it goes from it's current behavior where it gives +3.5% hit, +.4% crit, +.4% enemy dodge (we think) to a straight 2.5% dodge reduction.  This is certainly a nerf, but not necessarily an overwhelming one.  And, past the first 5 points, Expertise is actually more powerful than Weapon Skill.<br>
<br>
Long story short: we'll have to see what happens.  Starting with what the new talent does, and moving quickly into what the hit/expertise caps are.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_507712"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Hey Aldriana, I'm a bit slow but it occurred to me that since energy is a scarce source of ours, never losing energy from dodged sinisters could be a potentially very powerful boost (possibly helping offset the raised hit cap, if it is indeed raised)<br>
<br>
How hard would it be to figure out how much dps you'd gain from never having your sinisters dodged?  With your gear for example.  I forget exactly how much energy we lose on a dodged sinister strike 8?  12?  Hell with never being dodged many of us in that limbo area between 3s/5r and 4s/5r might find it possible to actually pull off 3s/5r.  Maybe I'm just dreaming :-)<br>

		<div id="post_message_507754"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->To clarify the tradeoff: cleaning stuff up for release is sort of a nuisance, so I'd prefer not to do it more often that I have to.  Hence, if I release what I have now, there probably won't be another full version (other than fixes) until we've nailed down all the 2.3 stuff.  So the question is: everything for 2.2 now, and nothing for 2.3 for a couple weeks... or some limited amount of 2.3 stuff in a couple days.<br>
<br>
Regarding dodged Sinister Strikes: minimal effect.  Sinister Strike that never gets dodged would be roughly a 1% increase to your sinister strike damage, and hence about 4-5 DPS total.  Not really that big a deal.<br>
<br>
Ballpark figures for those who are just that curious:<br>
Warglaive Set Bonus: ~300 AP<br>
Band of the Eternal Champion: about 12 AP ahead of the Revered Band of Eternity, aka just barely ahead of Band of the Ranger-General and Band of Lethality in weighted total, though behind both in raw DPS.<br>
Excutioner Enchant: assuming PPM the same as Mongoose, it's likely just slightly more damage (though less defensive mods) than Mongoose - hence, in weighted total, about the same.  Not worth reenchanting for, but for a new piece of gear, it may be worth using.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Yes, the hit cap may end up being a fair amount higher, but we can also mitigate dodge more than ever before.  Again: if WEx does anything other than +10 Expertise, there's a very good chance that we'll wind up with a net buff out of this.<br>

Essentially, anyone still in SSC/TK will be taking the bracers as an upgrade over anything available at that point, and anyone in any guild will want the boots, which are simply amazing.<br>
<br>
As far as the pants go, they are certainly better than T4, but not by enough to warrant the cost, in my opinion. For a T5 rogue, they certainly won't be worth it because, at least personally, I'd rather keep the 4/5 T5 bonus than use those haste pants, and Bloodsea Brigand's is better than T5 chest, so the pants have to go. There's also a pair of haste gloves, they seem to be, like the pants, roughly between T4 and T5 in quality.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
The boots... Well they are itemized incredibly well. But imo the blue socket makes Nyn'jah's Tabi boots somewhat inferior to Shadowmaster's. <br>
<br>
Let's say for combat you'd socket with orange/yellow/purple you'd end up with:<br>
<br>
35agi, 38stam, 15 hit, 20crit, 76ap (Pyrestone/Lionseye)<br>
vs<br>
39agi, 28stam, 30hit, 0crit, 60ap. (Shadowsong/Pyrestone)<br>
<br>
Coming down to:<br>
4agi, 15hit vs 20crit and 16ap.<br>
<br>
Socketing 2x Lionseye might change it a bit. <br>
Very close, but I'll be sticking to my Shadowmaster's, better for mutilate anyway.  <br>
<br>
Bracers are really nice, but all the other pieces (ugh... haste) are somewhat lackluster to be honest. Looking at the caster and feral druid pieces I'm somewhat disappointed in the rogue ones.<br>
<br>
Both the melee trinkets are nothing special either, but probably worth using over the Talisman (if you have that). WSC/TT or Madness (and Renataki of course) will still be better choices for pvp. <br>
<br>
The cloak is rather nice, excellent alternative to Teron cloak for pvp. Still it's 60 badge's which is kinda smeh. You wouldn't probably use it over Drape of the Dark Reavers for pve. So for a purely pvp semi-upgrade it's a tad bit expensive imho. <br>
<br>
I'd be interested in seeing the S3 weapons as well as the honor boots/belt/bracers. If they feature any armor reduction, then stacking that might offer some interesting results. Probably not enough to outdo BT items but depending on the weapon dps and it's stats (~~100-104dps s2 stats+ 120 armor reduction would be very very nice.)<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_508698"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->More quick thoughts and estimates regarding 2.3 gear:<br>
<br>
1) Expertise is, point-for-point, almost exactly equivalent to Hit Rating.  So for those of you wanting to do estimates in the meantime, plugging Expertise as extra hit rating will make a pretty good approximation of worth.<br>
2) Brooch of Deftness is significantly inferior to Choker of Vile Intent<br>
3) Dory's Embrace ranks 4th in overall cloak quality, about 10 AP behind Drape of the Dark Reavers.  It is 5th in DPS, also behind Vegeance Wrap.<br>

5) Is anyone else mildly annoyed that they've implemented 3 new feral druid belts but no new rogue belt?<br>
6) Shallow Grave Trousers are comparable to Leggings of Murderous Intent, Deathmantle Legguards, and Skulker's Greaves.  Hence, if you have one of those 3, they're probably not worth getting; if you don't, they are a reasonable upgrade over other options.<br>
7) Trickster's Stickyfingers are a nice intermediate between T4 and T5, where there was previously a considerable gap.<br>
8) Nyn'jah Tabi Boots are only slightly inferior to Shadowmaster's Treads, and certainly far better than anything else.<br>
9) Master Assassin Wraps are the best bracers pre-Hyjal.  By a lot.  But they are behind Insidious, Deadly, and Swiftstrike.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_508721"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I Still find it funny that we are debating boots from the second "raid" (used loosely since it is a 10 man) boss we would fight in this game as the best boots in the game. But i am glad i saved those 41 badges, and didn't burn them on the broach, cause that would be another 90 badges i would need to farm.<br>
<br>
One thing I am disappointed about is the fact that they didn't add an offhand sword to the Badge table. That is what I was really hoping for, but now that i think about it, they should have added an offhand for every weapon spec except for Daggers. To give people an non high end raid/pvp way to obtain offhands that are actually fast. I am very happy with my decision to farm the <a onclick="urchinTracker ('/external/http_www_wowhead_com_item_29275');" class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080322064126/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=29275" target="_blank">[Searing Sunblade]</a> and i think other specs should have had that same option and not be forced to pvp for offhands.<br>

It also forces me to stay daggers.

		<div id="post_message_508851"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Excellent update Aldriana!<br>
<br>
However, I noticed a new little quirk with how gem slots work, and I'm not sure you intended for them to function this way.<br>
<br>
When I downloaded the new version and was going through switching from your gear to mine, I noticed that when I switched a piece of gear that had more/less or different colored gem slots, the spreadsheet didn't actually recognize the discrepancy until I clicked on a gem slot that was either supposed to exist but didn't, or didn't exist but should have.  <br>
<br>
A good example is going from your Swiftstrike Bracers to my Veteran's Leather Bracers, I gain a yellow gem slot.  Merely switching the item didn't reveal my new gem slot, however; I had to click on a grayed-out gem slot to cause it to activate itself.<br>
<br>
Also, when switching to a piece of gear with fewer gem slots than its predecessor, the recommended gem slots will not change from what was in them before (so if I go from, say, Bladed Shoulderpads of the Merciless to Shoulderpads of the Stranger, I will have two gems in the recommended slots, but only one available socket slot.<br>
<br>
I didn't notice this in your 0.8 update post, but I apologize if it was mentioned previously.  I'm posting during my work break, so I didn't go back and comb through all the older replies.<br>
<br>

I looked into it and noticed that you were only off by 100armor on your assumption (assuming 7700 armor -2600 for 5SA you get 5100 armor on most bosses).  That said, using the tabs in .8 to get 5SA up + the 7700 base armor of the boss (still equal to 5100, correct?) I am still seeing close to a 50DPS difference, in favor of .8.<br>

</div>Right, and that's the key point.  At the moment there's roughly a 5% chance that a SS will be dodged.  If it's dodged, you lose 8 energy and get to try again; hence, the averaged energy required to get an SS to actually go off is 32+8/.95 (or so) - pulling the actual number from the spreadsheet, with the default gear this works out to an expected 40.44 energy per SS.  If we were never dodged, it would be 40 energy per SS, a reduction in cost by about the 1 percent sited earlier.  The bigger advantage is that it's less disruptive to your cycles, as there are circumstances where having to make a 2nd (or 3rd) try to land the SS will cause your SnD to lapse for a second or your energy to cap out.  This isn't modeled in the sheet, though.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">More quick thoughts and estimates regarding 2.3 gear:<br>
<br>
1) Expertise is, point-for-point, almost exactly equivalent to Hit Rating.  So for those of you wanting to do estimates in the meantime, plugging Expertise as extra hit rating will make a pretty good approximation of worth.<br>
8) Nyn'jah Tabi Boots are only slightly inferior to Shadowmaster's Treads, and certainly far better than anything else.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</div><br>
1) Do I understand correctly that 1 weapon skill was better then 1 hitrating so this is another nerf for rogues?<br>
8) Far better? Comparing Edgewalker they only offer +6 hit, +16 AP and -7 stam. The fact that you need a blue gem makes the socketbonus pretty useless as there are no good blue dps gems. Better I agree.. but far better? Hardly imho.<br>
On the other hand there is offcourse no other boots upgrade from the 2nd boss in KZ (edgewalker) to the 7th (?) boss in Black Temple (Shadowmaster's Boots). :/<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_509500">The first 5 points of weapon skill were better than hit; hence, this is a nerf to combat rogues.  However, after the first 5 points, Hit was better than weapon skill, and, thus, expertise is also better than weapon skill after the first 5 points.  Hence, items with weapon skill are more powerful now than before, but, assuming they haven't changed the base miss/dodge rate against level 73s, yes, rogues will experience a slight reduction of DPS.  However, I do mean "slight".  We're talking on the order of 10-20 DPS, I suspect.<br>
<br>
Regarding Nyn'jah Tabi: Yes, blue gems suck for DPS.  This is why you ignore the socket bonus and socket with your favorite combination of red and yellow gems.  Hence, the comparison is 6 hit and 16 AP vs 7 sta.  6 hit, depending on your gear, is worth roughly 15 AP.  7 sta, according to the weighting in the sheet, is about 4 AP-equivalent.  Hence, Nyn'jah Tabi is roughly a 27 AP upgrade relative to Edgewalker Longboots.<br>
<br>
Now, is 27 AP an ultra-collosal mega-upgrade?  No, it's not.  But when the 2nd and 3rd place items differ by 27 AP, that's pretty significant.  Consider: the 2nd-best and 7th-best necks are separated by only 25 AP.  The 2nd-best and 6th-best shoulder are separated by 28 AP.  The 2nd and 6th best cloaks are separated by 28 AP.  The 2nd and 5th best bracers are separated by 28 AP.  The 1st and 4th best belts are separated by only 14 AP.  The 2nd and 6th best legs are separated by 24 AP.  The 3rd and 9th best rings are separated by only 24 AP.  So when the 2nd and 3rd items are more disparate in quality than the 2nd and 6th are for many slots, I would argue that that qualifies as "far better".  If you want to mince words and say it's merely "clearly better" or "obviously better", so be it.  The fact remains: it is a significant and obvious upgrade over everything else, and for me there are only a handful of available upgrades in the entire game that are a larger boost.

RED gives me about 25 dps. Adding and removing dexerity(12agi) from boots yields a 7dps decrease so I guess RED(red - 12agi) is worth about 18dps or 6dps per 1%crit damage. so 5% crit damage would net me about 30dps. Sword spec is worth about ~74dps and fist spec ~55dps. I guess none of these calculations are valid since crit damage increase is not linear but at least the new mace spec gives some dps increase the previous one didn't <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080111083319im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":)" class="inlineimg"><br>

</div>Kinda sad I was to cheap to spend dkp on the vashj belt now lol. Was a minor upgrade, now it'll be the belt that owns them all. <br>
Btw.. If I look at <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080111083319/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=30106"><span  ><span class="purplename">[Belt of One-Hundred Deaths]</span></span></a> (wowhead 2.3: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080111083319/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=30106" target="_blank">Belt of One-Hundred Deaths - Items - World of Warcraft</a>) then the skill rating simply gets removed without anything else replacing it. Has anybody managed to get onto PTR to verify this? <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080111083319/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=30103"><span  ><span class="purplename">[Fang of Vashj]</span></span></a> is the same, no stats changed other then the removal of the daggerskill.<br>
That would mean <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080111083319/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=30879"><span  ><span class="purplename">[Don Alejandro's Money Belt]</span></span></a> would become the undisputed best belt ingame.<br>
<br>
I'm unsure though.. as a human rogue with 2/2WE I only needed 300 +hit to cap (308 for non-humans). Now I'll be needing 363 - (10expertise x 15.7) = 324 +hit. (I am correct in assuming that the mob having less dodge is the same as me having more hit right?)<br>
<br>
However the WE talent now also gives 2.5% less parry which we had a static 5% before 2.3 which no ammount of +hit could change (very unsure off this so don't take this for truth and do correct/confirm me if you know).<br>
If this 5% parry chance I have in my head for some reason is true.. isn't this -2.5% to parry worth as much as +2.5% +hit then? I doubt I'm right caus this would make expertise seriously better and bliz buffing rogues can't be right. Anyway, I'd realy appreciate it if somebody could explain the details where I'm wrong and what is right.</div>

Btw..

</div>I picked up Don Alejandro's two nights ago. I also have shadow-walkers cord (btw our guild has gotten 9+ of these now -- we hate them with a  burning passion) and a belt of deep shadow. 0.8 puts deep shadow above Don Alejandro's (in the offensive category) and same with the DPS spreadsheet. So I would say it's quite disputed. Right now I have 2 +10 hit gems in the belt of deep shadows and 2 +5agi/5hit on Don Alenjandro's, so I can switch them about depending on my needs. I've heard multiple people refer to DA's as the second best belt in the game behind Vashj, but why is it? and why does it not show up in the sheets?</div>

I have a couple of questions concerning the recently uploaded version of your spreadsheet. In the Xs5r tab, under the 'Actual Attack Counts' section, the 'MH Procs Per PPM' cells (row 276) refer to the 'MH Atts' cells (row 257). Should this be 'MH Hits' (row 260) instead? In the previous sections the 'MH Procs Per PPM' cells referenced the latter cells.<br>
<br>
Also, in the iterative sections, is blade flurry taken into account? I did not notice a reference to it until the 'Actual Attack Accounts' section.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Hi Aldriana,<br>
<br>

	</table>
</div>1) Yes, it should point to MH hits.  I'll fix it in the next version.  In the meantime, the sheet will slightly overvalue PPM effects.<br>
<br>
2) Blade Flurry (and Heroism, and Haste Pots/Drums, and Adrenaline Rush) aren't factored in during the iterative portion.  The reason for this is that one can't realistically adjust one's cycle based on a buff you receive only once every 2 minutes.  So you get the benefit of the extra attacks/energy from a damage perspective, but you don't get to contract your cycle based on them, which I would argue is a pretty effective model of how things work; AR doesn't let you drop your cycle from 3.3s5r to 2.8s5r (or whatever) - you do your normal cycle most of the time, and just squeeze in a bunch of extra Sinister Strikes (and maybe an Eviscerate or something) during the AR itself, and then go back to your regular cycle.<br>
<br>
3) The spreadsheet doesn't factor in PPM effects based on rupture, since, to my knowledge, no one has ever figured out what the proc behavior of finishers is.<br>

</div>Well, from the perspective of a combat rogue who is past the big hump of the first 5 points of combat skill anyway, the human racial currently gives .5% hit, .2% crit, and .2% dodge, according to the model in this sheet.  Is 1% crit better than that?  I would argue that it is, just barely.  Converting things to rating points and scoring them in the spreadsheet, my count is that the current human racial is worth 39.1 AP for a combat rogue (at least, one that's wearing my gear), and the new one will be worth 43.2 AP.  So, yes, slightly less for humans.<br>

</div>20/41 comes on top with Gear Spreadsheet with 33,99dps, on DPS Spreadsheet (other thread) about 40dps ahead. If you use Hemo Debuff DPS Estimate on DPS Spreadsheet 11/21/29 comes on top with ~28dps.<br>
<br>
Dont know which conclusion to make from these, 11/21/29 might be better for raiding or? Anyone with more experience from hemo?<br>

</div>Ground the numbers on these, and the answer appears to be that it's a 1 PPM effect with a 60 sec internal cooldown.  Details available upon request, but it's fairly unambiguous.  With that proc behavior and my gear, the spreadsheet predicts 12.6% uptime on the proc, which matches well with the 13% you found in practice; hence the estimates I made before are probably pretty good.  I will add the ring to the next version of the sheet.</div>

Single best point we can spend), Dirty Deeds is really only worth like 20-25 dps per point, average though. Obviously I'd value it higher since usually the low end of a mob's life is when you need more damage (Though not always, Solarian for instance), but still it's not amazing point for point. I was showing Deadliness better than Sword spec as well, though you then miss out on Blade Flurry (Which I was considering over Prep, even though I would miss Prep a great deal. I can only assume BF every 2 minutes beats vanishing a few times and garroting for dps).<br>
<br>
All in all, I don't see it mathematically competing with Combat to the highest level, but it should perform just fine. I intend to give it a shot and see - absolutely loved Hemo back in Naxx with the MSA, and I feel like the dirty Deeds change should push it just enough to perform at least.</div>

</div>Coincidentally, I have a little spreadsheet that whips out damage per energy calculations for Eviscerate and Rupture based on all your stats, and also allows you to calculate your raid buffed stats, to simulate exactly what you're talking about. As a sword build, with raid-buffed stats of 36% crit (plus RED), 3330 AP (time averaged), and hell, let's even throw in 2-piece Deathmantle and 3/3 Imp Evis, 5-CP Eviscerate is only 83.40 DPE against 0 armor, while Rupture is still 93.55.<br>
<br>
There is basically no point where Evis catches up to Rupture because even with Imp Evis and realistically achievable amounts of crit, it just doesn't scale as well with AP, plus it costs 35 energy to Rupture's 25.</div>

</div>So, your armory currently has a Riding Crop equipped, so I can't be sure what your usual 2nd trinket is, but the only selection I can find that makes the recommendation 5s3r would be Dragonspine Trophy, so I'm going to assume that for the moment.<br>
<br>
With your gear as listed in Armory + Dragonspine Trophy, the cycle recommendation is 5s3r.  According to the sheet, this should be sustainable with SnD uptime of 99.7%; that is, it will drop occasionally, but for the most part it will be up.  So, first question: is this reasonable?<br>
<br>
Well, lets see.  To execute a 5s3r cycle with 2/3 Ruthlessness requires an average of 7.2 backstabs per cycle, which takes 432 energy.  It also costs 10 net energy to launch a 3 point rupture, so the total energy requirement is 442 energy.  With 2/5 T4, a 5-pt SnD lasts 34.8 seconds; hence, for this to be sustainable from a theoretical perspective, one needs to generate 442/34.8 = 12.7 energy per second.  Your hit rate is about 95% (&lt;1% miss chance, 5% dodge chance), and you are attacking with a 1.4 speed weapon.  With SnD, this works out to .88 hits per second or so, which is 2.65 energy per second, plus the baseline regen of 10 is 12.65.  Compare to the 12.7 needed, and recalling that we never factored in the extra energy procs from Dragonspine Trophy... all in all, this looks more or less sustainable in the average case.<br>
<br>
Now, in practice, energy regen isn't that smooth.  Ruthlessness can fail to proc a couple times in a row, Combat Potency can have a dry spell, and so on.  So, in practice, yes, this cycle, like all tight cycles, may have issues with sustainability; the energy bar is not large enough to let you smooth out these differences in the long-term average case; particularly as a dagger rogue, which limits the size of the energy buffer you can reasonably sustain.<br>
<br>
Thus, while this cycle is theoretically possible, I probably wouldn't use it in reality.  Instead, I would do one of two things:<br>
<br>
1) Use 5s5r3s instead, which will be far more sustainable and has average-case DPS less than 1 DPS behind 5s3r, or<br>
2) Drop another point from Lethality to get 3/3 Ruthlessness, which will allow you to trim your cycle down to 1s3r (with the occasional 4-point rupture if Combat Potency/Ruthlessness give you a nice spike), which has sustained DPS that is also comparable and much less likely to drop SnD uptime.</div>

</div>HMM so it looks like, raid buffed, you'd have to get it wayyy below 15% mitigation to have the same level of DPE than ruputure.  :\  Just wondering, noticed a lot of armor pen available, plus the rise in crit would mean an improvement, not to mention, if you include mangle into the equation, rupture gaines even more dpe probably... :\</div>

You made a mistake in your rupture's value :<br>
1000 + 3000*0.24 = 1720.<br>

Therefore, your 1720 avg rupture is <u>without</u> mangle.<br>

</div>Ah I follow you.  It's interesting because for my gear it has belt of deepshadows ahead from an "Offensive" weighted standpoint by a smidge (2 AP) even before any gems are placed in the belt.  After rigid dawnstones Deep shadows is ahead like 12 AP equivalents.  Perhaps also I just have a fair amount of stam overall and I don't feel the need for the stam on the Akama belt.</div>

		<div id="post_message_512116">When I equip Deep Shadows, gemmed as it is right now, I gain ~2 dps relative to Shadowwalker's, and lose 24 stamina.  This would drop me from my current ~9500 unbuffed to ~9300.  And, fundamentally, there's enough incidental damage on most of these fights that having the extra cushion strikes me as nice.  I mean, it's not truly *essential* on most fights, but it increases your chances of surviving a bad combination of 2 or more of Blizzard/Flamestrike/Consecrate/Deadly Poison on Council, Provides cushion on phases 2 and 3 of Reliquary (and phase 1 as well, depending on your strategy), and so on.  There's only about 3 fights in Hyjal/BT where I *don't* find that extra HP are useful  - Kaz'rogal, Teron, and Gurtogg.  <br>
<br>
So, again, tradeoffs, as always. If we were talking 10 DPS vs 24 sta, my answer would be different.  But 2 DPS vs 24 sta?  I find it hard to argue that's not worth it.<br>
<br>
In other news: I punched the new ZA loot into my spreadsheet, and it appears that the most interesting piece of loot in the instance, from a rogue's perspective, is Signet of Primal Wrath, which is second only to Stormrage's Signet Ring in terms of overall quality, ranking just slightly ahead of Ring of Deceitful Intent in terms of weighted total (and about 10 AP ahead in terms of raw DPS).  Most of the rest of the loot weighs in about where you'd expect: better than Karazhan loot, but slightly inferior to SSC/TK loot.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">What's the word on including the weapon expertise changes into the spreadsheet?  I know that there might need to be some more testing done (although it seems like the main thing up in the air is whether it will in fact apply to parries, which doesn't affect us much).  Also I imagine that there will need to be quite a few calculations added and removed as it is a totally new stat.  Anyway, just curious, we were fighting Al'ar last night and the gloves that drop are only slightly better than T4 atm, I'm wondering if they will be a bit better with the expertise change.</div>

However, if you review the last few pages, you will find my preliminary estimates on the matter.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Not really, no.  In addition to moving all the forumlas, you need to redefine the named ranges to include the new items.  Also, copying the forumlas straight over tends not to work exactly, since not all the formulas have dollar signs everywhere they're needed to make the formulas directly copy.<br>
<br>
Honestly, given the frequency with which new releases of the sheet are coming out right now, the recommended way of getting an item into the sheet is to post it in this thread, and I'll add it the next release (assuming it strikes me as worth adding, anyway - again, I'm trying to limit this to 5-man blues and up).</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</div>Actually I was able to add new items pretty easily and the formula's worked fine.<br>
<br>
All I had to do after unhiding the sheets I needed was to insert a new row right before the last line of that equipment slot.  Then just copy/paste the cells using formulas, entered the stats etc...<br>
<br>
As for the drop location, that was a bit trickier.  I just used existing ones (didnt think you could just add a new location and get it to show due to the check boxes on the main page).  Examples:<br>
 for Zul'Aman gear I just labeled it as dropping in Kara for now.  <br>
for my Assassination gear I just labeled it as 5 mans.<br>
for the new Heroic Badge loots, I just labeled it as heroics.<br>
<br>
This is all a temporary fix till a new sheet comes out but worked fine for me.</div>

Anyway, you can manually add Malchazeen as an off hander. Right click on the Talent_Equipment tab at the bottom left corner of your Excel window. Select Show, mark Weapons and click Okay. In the Weapons sheet, you can simply replace the values of any off hand dagger to those of Malchazeen.</div>

As a general rule, each .1 speed on the OH is worth about 10 DPS on it; and being a sword is worth more like 20.

</div>It's funny... you rib the guy for mixing up his MH and OH swords, and you my friend just did the same... lol.  The slicer is the MH and Quickblade is the OH.  No big whoop.<br>

Anyway, when I used the spreadsheet with my current gear (Talon in MH and MGQb in OH), I notice a drop in DPS.  Not a huge drop, but some nonetheless.</div>

Basically, the ranking of top-end MH weapons looks something like this:<br>

I didn't bother to include the non-sword PvP MHs, as I have a hard time seeing why one would pick one up as they're inferior to the MH Swords.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</div><br>
Why would ToA and BoI be worse than the Arena S3 sword?  Because of dmg range? Dps? Topend? Speed?<br>
<br>
I was always under the impression that even with speed normalization, a slow MH is good for white dmg to take advantage of more of your AP; and the top end from the ToA/BoI is better for SS anyways, right?</div>

</div>The spreadsheet already supports hybrid builds such as mace/sword.  It doesn't have the new mace spec in yet, but yes, that will be added for 2.3.  However, it's still inferior; the increased critical damage, while nice, is simply not up to the part of sword and fist specs for PvE (though quite nice in PvP, as I understand it).  Consider:<br>
<br>
Say 40% of your attacks are crits.  In practice, my crit rate is rarely that high, but lets go with it.  That means that with 5/5 mace spec, 40% of your attacks will do an extra 10% of your base damage; hence you effectively gain 4% of your base damage per attack.<br>
<br>
Fist Spec adds 100% of your base damage to 5% of attacks; hence, you effectively gain 5% of your base damage per attack.<br>
<br>
Hence, even at 40% crit rate, fist spec is superior to mace spec.  And to get crit rate even that high generally requires T6 quality gear (unless you're gimping yourself on hit/AP, anyway).  And Maces have the added problem that the post-T5 itemization for them stinks; Dragonstrike is the best mace in the game.  So, in the long run, swords are still the way to go.<br>

</div>DPS. Please never use the words "top end" as if they referred to anything meaningful. Speed doesn't matter for white damage, only for Sinister Strike (due to weapon speed normalization), and 0.1 speed on a main hand is certainly not greater than 7 DPS (I believe I found it to be around 3 DPS, roughly), even if you factor in the stat difference.</div>

</div>Top end damage is meaningless.  Average damage and damage per second are the only relevant stats.  Since the Arena 3 MH has more DPS and higher average damage than Blade of Infamy, with comparable stats, it's not hard to see why it would be better.<br>
<br>
Mind you, it's not better by a heck of a lot; we're talking maybe 15 AP relative to BoI and maybe 25 relative to Talon.  So while it's definitely better, it's not "any rogue who isn't rated 1850 (or whatever it is) or higher in arena is gimped for PvE" better.  It helps.  But if you don't PvP, it's not that much of a disadvantage.<br>
<br>
While we're on the topic: the reason slow weapons are better is not related to taking better advantage of AP on autoattacks; it's related to 1) higher average SS damage and 2) higher average Sword Spec/Windfury procs.</div>

</div>The haste procs are handled as procs rather than passive haste; hence, they're not listed as haste on the spreadsheet.  They are being modeled though.<br>

The 168 armor is a mistake, which will be fixed next revision.<br>
<br>
When I said "The Arena 2 MHs" I was referring to the sword/fist in particular; the Arena 2 mace is, of course, worse still.<br>

</div>There's a lot of misinformation about this, and I've laid out my opinion in most of the relevant threads if you want to look for it, but the gist of it is this:<br>

Assuming you had an otherwise identical talent spec, fist/sword would do comparable or just barely more damage than sword/sword assuming weapons of equal quality.  However, in practice, you don't have an otherwise identical talent spec, and the talent points you lose cost you more damage than any benefit you may glean from the fist/sword combination; as such, while fist/sword is a viable alternative if you don't have a good MH sword, I can't think of any reason why one would actively choose to use fists while swords were available; as such, if you have the arena points to get a MH weapon, I can't think of any reason to select the fist over the sword, since it results in an overall spec that is inferior.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Top end damage is meaningless.  Average damage and damage per second are the only relevant stats.  Since the Arena 3 MH has more DPS and higher average damage than Blade of Infamy, with comparable stats, it's not hard to see why it would be better.<br>
<br>
Mind you, it's not better by a heck of a lot; we're talking maybe 15 AP relative to BoI and maybe 25 relative to Talon.  So while it's definitely better, it's not "any rogue who isn't rated 1850 (or whatever it is) or higher in arena is gimped for PvE" better.  It helps.  But if you don't PvP, it's not that much of a disadvantage.<br>
<br>
While we're on the topic: the reason slow weapons are better is not related to taking better advantage of AP on autoattacks; it's related to 1) higher average SS damage and 2) higher average Sword Spec/Windfury procs.</div>

</div>Alright, well then I've been horribly misinformed and will correct these people swiftly..lol<br>
<br>
Another thing, I'm using the spiteblade now (I get the first ToA that drops..when it finally drops), but i've gone against two rogues, both with comparable stats, one using S1 MH and one using S2 MH and beat them both, usually handily, of course they still think evisc is a better finisher &gt;.&gt;.  Wouldn't the S1 be an upgrade over the spiteblade since it has a higher avg and higher dps? <br>
<br>
Also, is the Blade of Infamy a considerable upgrade over ToA, not that hit is valued slightly lower than agi? Just wondering, because we're about to kill kael hopefully, and I'd rather take the first BoA if I know its a considerable upgrade or if it's only slight, I'll stick with ToA.</div>

</div>It's a fairly small upgrade on the whole; on the other hand, it's the best there is until Warglaives.  So while I wouldn't take it from someone who still has a MH from a T4 instance, it's certainly a nice upgrade to pick up at some point.<br>

</div>Rod of the Sun King is 1 PPM; see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080306033525/http://elitistjerks.com/f31/t14375-rogue_mechanics_testing_thread/" target="_blank">http://elitistjerks.com/f31/t14375-r...esting_thread/</a>.  Post 26 has the raw data in it.<br>
<br>
Regarding the value of it versus Dragonstrike: it depends on your current gear.  They're pretty close on the whole, but my experience with this is that Dragonstrike is a bit ahead for most people.<br>
<br>
...Although, upon taking a second look at it, I just realized that I neglected to update Rod of the Sun King for the new PPM findings, so it's actually a bit overvalued right now.  As usual, will be fixed in the next revision.</div>

<br>
First let me thank you for all of your hard work and care in putting together and maintaining this spreadsheet during your free time.  I think that I can speak for many players when I say that your sheet has been an invaluable tool in helping us to make gear decisions.<br>
<br>
My question is in regard to the DPS estimate on your spreadsheet.  In practice, my DPS in raids varies quite a bit around your estimate depending on the particular fight: tank threat generation, being incapacitated, etc.  I am wondering if your DPS estimate includes energy use for feint and, if so, how often?  I find that on some bosses my threat total easily nears that of our main tank and I spend considerable time feinting or delaying special attacks (sometimes wasting energy ticks).  Thus, my DPS for these fights according to our WWS parses comes out a bit lower than projected on your spreadsheet.  If you do not currently include feint do you have plans to include it?  I realize that the use of this ability is both situational and personal and therefore difficult to model.<br>
<br>
I apologize if this topic has been previously discussed, but I did not find much information regarding feint in this thread (the search tool provided two posts).  In case this information is of use for your answer, our raid uses Omen to estimate threat and I generally save Vanish for ~80% boss health, after using major cooldowns.  I also use the cycle suggestion on your sheet and in fights without threat (e.g. Akama, Gurtogg phase 2, RoS phase 1) my DPS is much higher than your estimate.  I want to maximise my performance in our raids, which in turn helps to maximise raid performance, but I get worried when my DPS on our WWS parses is lower than your theoretical estimate.  I am looking for reasons why this may occur.<br>
<br>
To summarize:<br>
1) Does your spreadsheet account for the use of feint?<br>
2) If not, should our practical DPS in a raid be less than your estimate?<br>
3) Does my tank need greater threat generation?<br>
4) Is the problem on my end and, if so, is there any advice for this situation?<br>
<br>
Lastly, I realize that the purpose of your spreadsheet is to compare gear and not necessarily make a DPS estimate for the whole character.  However, I am more confident in your Gear spreadsheet than the alternative DPS spreadsheet and, thus, am seeking your advice.</div>

		<div id="post_message_517500">To answer in brief:<br>
<br>
1) No<br>
2) No<br>
3) Probably<br>
4) Hard to say<br>
<br>
To answer in a bit more depth:<br>
<br>
I would expect damage to vary quite a bit from the number in the sheet in practice, as the variance on rogue DPS is fairly high.  Even if you execute the perfect cycle with the same gear every single fight, your DPS will probably vary by as much as 100 DPS either way.<br>
<br>
The sheet makes absolutely no allowance for threat reduction; I have actually considered adding that option, but I haven't felt a huge demand for it so I have not included it yet.<br>
<br>
Regarding your specific examples of sustained DPS situations: it should be noted that RoS Phase 1 has 0 armor and, as such, tends to generate much larger DPS numbers than you get elsewhere.  And my concerns with the other two examples is that you're dealing with combat segments less than one minute long, which colors your DPS number.  Even neglecting cooldowns for the moment (and I, for one, tend to blow AR, Blade Flurry, Haste Pots, Heroism, etc. during non-aggro-limited sections of fights), the simple fact that you start with 100 energy increases your DPS by a good 50 or so; plus, the variance on such short sections of combat is even higher.  I've seen rogues average 20% crit on Akama one week and 50% the next week without changing any gear or buffs.<br>
<br>
So, the benchmarking fights I'd use are things like Tidewalker (if you can get an un-graved attempt), Teron Gorefiend, or (depending on your strategy), Azgalor; with a good tank, these should not be threat-limited enough that you need to feint - vanish should be plenty, and even that may not be necessary depending on your tank.  If you are having serious aggro issues on these fights, your tank is probably not generating as much aggro as is possible, either due to lacking proper aggro-generation itemization (hit, expertise, shield block, etc.), not mashing hard enough, or not using the correct aggro cycle.  For reference: most of the rogues in my guild don't even have feint on their bars.<br>
<br>
Regarding specific DPS comparisons to the sheet: make sure your buffs and the bosses armor are entered correctly; for instance, the "Number of Heroisms" parameter is number per 10 minutes, so if you get one in a 3 min fight like Akama, you may want to enter 3 instead of 1.  But, you should also remember that there's a lot of variance in this.  Personally, I've found it to be fairly accurate for me, but if you're finding it inaccurate, I would look through a WWS or two and figure out where the disagreement is between theory and practice.</div>

<br>
Teron Gorefiend is one of the fights that I also have threat issues with.  Typically our melee group does not use any cooldowns until about 70% and our shaman twists Windfury and Tranquil Air to help us keep threat low until that point.  Still, I generally have to throw a feint into roughly every other cycle; after cooldowns are blown at 70% I'll drop my vanish and threat really isn't an issue after that.<br>
<br>
So, I suspect that the problem mostly lies in my tank's threat generation.  We no longer step foot into Serpentshrine and our strat for Azgalor has melee running out of combat when hit by a rain of fire.  Buff differences between the sheet and what actually occurs in my raid is probably the next major culprit in my discrepancy and I'll look into that more deeply -- thanks again.</div>

</div>I have Rod of the Sun King since it dropped on our first Kael kill and at that time I was daggers and went for it since the other rogues did not want it. <br>

Since then we only had one talon and lots of blade of infamy but I never wanted to change infamy for the rod. <br>
After the ssc/tk weapon buff its very close when it comes to swords and I am always on top with the other rogue who is swords.<br>
<br>
As regarding the proc I would say its 2-3ppm and this is not a conclusion after testing that I did but I watch randomly during boss fights. Then again I might be missing the sword spec from the MH but as regarding dps and ppm I would say that the Rod is very good.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I posted some quick thoughts on this in post 1106:<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Basically, the ranking of top-end MH weapons looks something like this:<br>

<br>
I didn't bother to include the non-sword PvP MHs, as I have a hard time seeing why one would pick one up as they're inferior to the MH Swords.<br>
<br>
Edit: Savagery-&gt;Infamy</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</div>Would it be possible to show the difference between these weapons say at different benchmarks of maybe 2000ap 35% crit, 1800ap 30% crit etc etc, just to see the difference.<br>
<br>
It would be interesting to see how much you lose in PvE dps using a mace over sword because it gives you the added bonus of great PvP utility.</div>

</div>Keep in mind than when I say 1 PPM, I don't mean it only procs once per minute; I mean it's a 1 PPM effect and thus, with instant attacks, will actually be observed proccing closer to twice a minute.  For instance:<br>

	</table>
</div>Looking at this data set: we have 3894 melee attacks; typically about 1/3 of those are MH attacks.  Thus, we have something like 1300 MH white hits.  If it were a 1 PPM effect as postulated, we would expect 1300 MH hits to generate roughly 40 procs.<br>
<br>
Additionally, we have 934 Sinister Strikes; assuming 1 PPM, we would expect to see about 40 procs from this as well.<br>
<br>
Finally, we have 65 kicks and eviscerates, which I believe can proc, which would make for a couple more procs.<br>
<br>
Thus, if it were a 1 PPM effect as postulated, we'd expect to see about 85 procs.  In reality, there were 104.  So while it might be a bit over 1 PPM, it's certainly a lot less than 2.<br>

<br>
After inputting my spec into your spreadsheet, I find myself puzzled looking at my current hit vs. the optimal hit.  I have a mix of T4/T5 gear, and other than my OH (which I took a beating on the other day, and now swapped for something else) I consider my gear to be outstanding considering we are not beyond SSC/TK right now.<br>
<br>
So my current hit is 242... your sheet calculates 206.  Have I put too much emphasis on AGI which is at 610 unbuffed, or am I thinking too hard about HIT for the time being?<br>
<br>
Check my armory and tell me what you think, or can you point me to a discussion on the relationship between AGI, HIT, and Crit... <br>
<br>
Thanks</div>

		<div id="post_message_518922">Rogar, from what it sounds like the sheet is actually reccomending you socket away from hit rating and put in, I would assume, agi gems.  This seems a little odd to be because the value of hit rating seems to dramatically increase when you have powerful procs like DST, part of this might be the DST nerf or it could also be an odd selection of buffs.  One other thought about the seemingly low value of hit for you is that hit will increase in value if you have two epic weapons, so if you plugged your gear in with the s2 OH and then compared to the blue your armory shows, or latro's even Hit will be better with better weapons.<br>
<br>
Agi, Hit and Crit will never break down into a x Agi = y Hit, because they change in effectiveness depending on your buffs and gear, for example if you check/uncheck the kings buff the value of agi changes greatly.  Also various procs increase the value of different stats, take your Tsunami Talisman having that equiped will make crit and also agi more valuable.<br>
<br>
Ultimatly the answer is that it depends, because gear will not have the same amounts of stats on them, so while hit might be more valuable point for point than agi if something has twice the agi it will be better.</div>

As the sheet doesnt have a spot for the Revenger, I changed the data for the Latros... so your thought about 2 epic weapons could still be part of the equation.  As a test though, I created a spreadsheet from a guild mate that has the S2 Swords, and even took the time to input all of his gear, gems, and enchants... 206 ends up being his optimal hit, way lower than I had ever believed made sense.<br>

Not at any point in time has agi ever come out on top of hit for my gear while under the offensive category.  It's on the top left of your spreadsheet near your race.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">After inputting my spec into your spreadsheet, I find myself puzzled looking at my current hit vs. the optimal hit.  I have a mix of T4/T5 gear, and other than my OH (which I took a beating on the other day, and now swapped for something else) I consider my gear to be outstanding considering we are not beyond SSC/TK right now.<br>
<br>
So my current hit is 242... your sheet calculates 206.  Have I put too much emphasis on AGI which is at 610 unbuffed, or am I thinking too hard about HIT for the time being?<br>
<br>
Check my armory and tell me what you think, or can you point me to a discussion on the relationship between AGI, HIT, and Crit...</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</div>Having looked at your gear and played with the spreadsheet a bit, I think it fundamentally comes down to your OH Weapon.<br>
<br>
1) Revenger is a vastly lower-DPS weapon than Talon of Azshara; hence, the overall value of white damage is lower relative to the overall value of yellow damage (as all yellow attacks are performed with a 95 DPS sword, and 40% of white damage is coming from a 70 DPS sword).  Since yellow damage benefits not at all from hit, this lowers the value of hit to some extent.<br>
<br>
2) A major contribution of hit is that it allows your procs to proc more often.  Hence, the more procs you have, the better hit is; and, conversely, the fewer procs you have, the less valuable hit it.  In your case, as you have 20 agi rather than mongoose on the OH, you have one fewer proc than a lot of rogues and, as such, the value of hit is also depressed.<br>
<br>
In case you were wondering why 1) doesn't apply as strongly to Latro's, the answer is that it's mitigated by 2) as it related to Combat Potency.<br>

</div>Well, my to-do list for next release is back up to 15 items or so, meaning it's going to take a bit of time to work everything out.  I would expect it to take a couple weeks to sort out everything, particularly since there's still some mechanics on PTR that need to be divined (to wit: what are the base miss/dodge rates of bosses?  And is there any truth to the rumor that the Warglaive set bonus now has a hidden cooldown?).  As such, I wouldn't expect anything before the end of the month, and it could easily take longer (particularly since I've started work on some other projects).<br>
<br>
In the meantime, I would refer you to the assortment of posts made regarding the value of MH weapons over the last few pages, which, stated briefly, imply that the Season 3 Slicer is better than everything except Warglaive, but that it doesn't beat Talon or Infamy by very much.  So if you don't have anything else to spend points on, it's a perfectly valid place to dump them; but if you're desirous of obtaining significant amounts of other PvP gear it may not be your top priority.</div>

		<div id="post_message_519668">Well, Hemo costs 35 energy, your typical cycle is 5s/5r or some close kin of that, and you have Relentless Strikes but not Combat Potency.  So, off the top of my head, that sounds like your finishers are free and you just get a Hemo every 3.5 seconds.  Now, my understanding is that that damage then gets fed through the multipliers of each person - it does double that on a crit, and, in particular, it gets mitigated by armor.  My best guess it that when you average out all those multipliers accross the tanks, hunters, rogues, etc. you wind up getting less than 36 damage out of the debuff in practice - I suspect 85% of that or so is more typical.  So each debuff adds something like 300-310 damage, or in the ballpark of 85 DPS.<br>
<br>
So, the question is: is this enough to make up the difference between Hemo and Combat?  Well, with my current gear and full raid buffs, the spreadsheet is reporting 1734 DPS for my combat swords build.  If I spec 11/27/23 Hemo and adjust my equipment to make better use of the new spec (still using items I actually have), it reports 1607 DPS.<br>
<br>
Now, with the new Dirty Deeds in 2.3, I would do 20% more than than that while the mob was sub-35%.  Now, in practice, given that everyone else does more damage at low%, one is sometimes dead by the time you get to 35%, and, if your guild is like mine, Heroism tends to get popped earlier in that fight more often than later, one probably doesn't actually do 35% of your damage to mobs that are sub-35%.  In practice, one probably only does 25-30% of one's damage in this period.  For the sake of argument, lets say 25%.  Thus, Dirty Deeds increases one damage by about 5% on the whole; hence that 1607 now becomes 1688.  Throw in the 85 DPS we estimated for the Hemo debuff, and all of a sudden this isn't looking too bad.</div>

		<div id="post_message_519929">Oh, damn, you're right, I misread Dirty Deeds.  That makes it a lot less useful.  Those numbers were with 1/2 WEx and 2/2 Dirty Deeds (no Prep, since from a raid DPS perspective it doesn't do much unless you also have AR, which you don't).  Sounds like it's probably better to go 11/28/22 with 2/2 WEx and 1/2 Dirty Deeds, which ups the base DPS to 1619, which is increased by about 1% by Dirty Deeds to 1635.  Even with the 85 from Hemo, that doesn't match combat; and, moreover, it strikes me as more circumstantial; you're getting a larger fraction of your damage from Rupture, so on unrupturable mobs you'll do significantly less; additionally, your survivability is a bit lower from the loss of Vitality, and your burst damage suffers from the lack of AR.  Plus, you're using an extra debuff slot, which, depending on your guild, may be an issue.<br>
<br>
On the whole, it sounds like Hemo is closer to combat, but I'm not seeing a fundamental reason to bring a hemo rogue over a combat rogue from a DPS perspective.</div>

</div>Same here, yeah.  It's a step in the right direction, but not enough to tip the scales (or even to balance the scales...).  If Opp went to 2/2 or 3/3, it'd let CD rogues pick up Murder/etc.  But I think the true "fix" to balance daggers again would be to do something interesting with dagger spec, in addition to the 5% crit.</div>

This is a nerf PvE-wise, as it is reduced from 30 to 10 charges, which are going to be eaten up extremely fast in a normal 25-man pvp raid, that the hemo-buff will be basically non-existing in PvE. Alone a hunter can take 3-5 charges per second. So for PvE it is now not only useless, but practically non present, hence a nerf of aprx 6-7% DpS vs. current Hemo situation in PvE. <br>

</div>Not really.. Yes they nerfed it from 30 charges to a third of that.. but they also MORE than tripled the dmg per charge.  Instead of 30 * 10 extra damage, you now get 10 * 36.  Also, 10 charges are virtually GAURENTEED to be all eaten up in 3.5 seconds - 30 charges weren't always.<br>
<br>
So.. you are now more likely to be able to use all of the charges, and you gain more damage per hemo than before.</div>

</div>I don't see that that's particularly necessary, and, more to the point, I don't think Blizzard is going to implement daggers faster than 1.3 anytime soon.  Besides which, that's not really the problem.<br>
<br>
The problem, particularly after these new changes is not that dagger spec is too weak; it's that sword spec is too good.  With my current armor and Arena 2 Daggers, with the Aggression change, the spreadsheet estimates 1651 DPS (buffed).  Switching to combat fists (that is, fist/fist spec, not fist/sword hybrid), I show 1682 DPS... against Murderable targets.  Against non-Murderable targets, that goes down to 1639 DPS.  Given that fully half of BT and all of Hyjal is not Murderable, that's really not too bad a tradeoff - 2% less damage against Murderable targets, 1% more vs non-Murderable targets.  So I would argue that with the new changes, combat daggers is reasonably well-matched in terms of sustained DPS relative to Combat Fists (and hence Combat Maces).  The problem is that Combat Swords is just plain better, due to the power of OH sword spec.<br>
<br>
Now, this still leaves the problem that Combat Daggers cycles suck; what I would like to see to fix this is a new rank of slice and dice with a 3 second longer duration.  This would allow combat daggers to use the far more efficient 1s3r cycle without needing to resort to T4 2/5.  It would also increase rogue DPS a bit, to compsate for the overall loss DPS we'd suffer from having Sword Spec nerfed.<br>
<br>
Hence, my proposal for bringing the specs closer to balance is:<br>
<br>
1) Have OH Sword Spec proc OH hits instead of MH.  This would bring Sword Spec into balance with the other specs.<br>
2) Add SnD Rank 3, with base duration 12/15/18/21/24 seconds.  This would allow Dagger rogues to use a more efficient, less disruptable cycle.<br>
<br>
This would, coincidentally, also give Hemo rogues a better cycle (as currently they can't quite sustain 5s5r) - they could use 4s5r, which would also make them a slightly more stable spec for raiding.<br>
<br>
On the whole, it seems to me that this would address many of the current issues with spec balance.  I'm sure there are other ways of doing so, but this seems like the simplest way to me.<br>
<br>
<b>Edit:</b><br>
The alternative to #2 would be to bump Imp SnD up to 20/40/60%, which would have approximately the same effect overall; it would mean daggers would end up using a cycle more like 3s/3r, but that's acceptable.</div>

CD are much more affected by lethality than any other specc (35% more than swords) and so 3/3 ruthlessness + 5/5 lethality coupled with the extra 6% of new aggression will put CD back to the top with swords. <br>

		<div id="post_message_520259">Personally, my idea for fixing combat daggers would take a completely difference approach. I personally feel that the three principal problems for combat daggers are:<br>
<br>
- 5/5 Opportunity essentially required, forcing points out of Assassination, preventing full Ruthlessness, full Lethality, and Murder<br>
- Backstab cost prevents better cycles from being used<br>
- Dagger spec, like fist spec, does not scale fully with stats; it scales with AP, but not crit rate or hit rate<br>
<br>
I believe the first two issues could be addressed by two changes: add an energy reduction to Backstab to some talent in either Assassination or Combat, and push Opportunity back down to the second tier of Subtlety. In order to make up for the loss of 20% damage on Backstabs, its energy cost would need to be reduced by 10, to 50 -- this would increase Backstab DPE by 20%, basically the same effect as Opportunity, but achieved in a different manner.<br>
<br>
Backstab DPE is already sufficiently high, but the 60 energy cost penalizes it too much relative to Sinister Strike. As a result, you lose more from your cycle than you're gaining from your Backstabs. Without doing a lot of analysis right now to support this, I feel like a 50-energy Backstab would reduce a great deal of the cycle burden on dagger builds. In addition, requiring only Assassination and Combat talents for a dagger build would mean a 19/42/0 build for daggers, such as this:<br>
<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080306232711/http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=f0efoxZ0eV0bEz0MGRt" target="_blank">Talent Calculator - World of Warcraft</a><br>
<br>
In this build, imagine that Dagger Specialization provides both 1% crit and 2 energy off Backstab per talent point. This build would be able to compete quite evenly with combat swords, thanks to a better cycle, full Ruthlessness, full Lethality, and Murder.<br>
<br>
As far as fist and dagger specs are concerned, I'm not sure exactly how Blizzard can fix those. Extra attacks are an extremely powerful mechanic. One thing I know would scale with all stats, though, would be haste; changing one or both weapon specs to 1% haste per talent point would bring them into almost direct competition with swords. It would probably have to be fists, though, because dagger's superior DPE would have it surpassing swords by leaps and bounds if it had a 5% haste weapon spec.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I'll stop this rambling right now, as this post is pretty much against the cardinal rules of the forum, blindly theorycrafting without doing any math. Still, I think I'm making fairly educated guesses. I like Aldriana's suggestions too, but I would rather see dagger builds freed from the burdens of the 5/5 Opportunity requirement and the 60 energy cost of Backstab.</div>

</div>I'm not asking for it.  I'm just saying it's the best way to solve the current issue.  If you don't mind the fact that every single rogue wants to be swords and all other weapon types might as well just be sharded as soon as they drop, then there is no problem right now.  However, I think we would benefit more by having a couple of specs using different weapon types, thereby allowing all rogues in a raid to get weapons in a timely fashion since they're not all going for the same thing.  And if you look at the changes I proposed, there are both buffs and nerfs, which would on the net put us about where we are on DPS.<br>
<br>
My objection to solving the problem by buffing daggers is that it doesn't really strike at the core of the problem; as I've discussed before, the problem with Sword Spec is not scaling, it's that the benefit is assymetrically loaded on the two hands.  You can't buff the other specs to match; all that's going to do is make hybrid XXX/sword specs tops.  The problem that really needs to be solved is that every single rogue in existance wants to use a sword OH, which, coupled with the fact that there are very very few good OH swords from PvE, has led to the current situation where we're incredibly reliant on PvP weapons in order to itemize effectively.<br>
<br>
This is, similarly, my objection to the proposal of changing one of the other weapon effects to haste; while it would buff the spec, you'd still want to use a sword OH to get those procs, leading to a situation where fist/sword (or whatever) is clearly superior to all other specs.  Fundamentally, the only possible specializations that are going to perform in a way that solves the OH-sword problem is proc-based ones; so a haste (or crit, or armor pen, or whatever) *proc* specialzation would be a better solution.<br>
<br>
Really, though, this all becomes quite complicated and messy; the elegant solution is to simply nerf sword spec a bit, and then buff rogues through other means so that our DPS winds up in the same place with each of 4 or 5 different specs, rather than all of us winding up with one.  That's all I'm proposing; at no time have I advocated that our damage should be reduced.</div>

		<div id="post_message_520303">We'll agree to disagree. You are basically saying, "fix this by making sword spec worse... oh, by the way, while you are doing this please remember to buff all rogues."<br>
<br>
My real fear is Blizzard reading the first half and not the second. And for that matter, I hardly see sword-spec rogues out of proportion on raid dps given the age-old, completely accurate fact that we bring nothing else besides our damage ouptut on single targets.<br>
<br>
And quite frankly, I find your argument convoluted at best. The problem is that no matter what people will want to offhand a sword? How about a fix such that you can't logically take sword spec + mace or dagger or fist spec? You know, make something else worthwhile in the talent tree? How about you can only get procs from one spec period at a given time (e.g. your mainhand weapon determines the type of procs you get)? Then you'd only pick one spec and rogues could spend those points on other talents?<br>
<br>
You don't have to take away OH sword procs from sword rogues, you can simply take away OH sword procs from people not mainhanding a sword. Fixed. Now sword rogues don't have lose dps to fix what is current, imo, a non-problem as I know plenty of dagger rogues who are not quitting WoW just cause they don't have the highest dps build/spec. Not everyone min/maxes like the people you know, I guess. We have a mace-spec rogue who simply chooses not to respec weekly for the arena. <br>
<br>
In fact, if you take all 4 of the talents and compress them into 1 spot on the talent tree, each of which operates different, you'd end hybrid / dual spec-ing. And really, while I'm sure that spec-ing exists, I find the notion this a "problem" with sword spc to be completely absurd.<br>
<br>
While you think it's logical, that's perfectly fine, you're entitled to you opinion. In the meantime, I'm going to say it again: Sword rogues don't need a nerf. Fix whatever parity problem exists elsewhere.</div>

</div>To expand on this, I'd honestly like to know why we have swords and other weapons with 1.4 speed while many dagger offhands are 1.5.  Daggers are supposed to be the faster weapons, so I'd actually like a change to all itemization to reflect this.<br>
<br>
Dagger offhands -&gt; 1.1 speed (1.1/1.8 = 0.61)<br>
Swords/maces/fists -&gt; 1.6 speed (1.6/2.6 = 0.61)<br>
<br>
Then we'd actually have a similar ratio for weapon speeds based on the hand used.  Another benefit is this would also level out the specs somewhat.  Fists and maces could opt to use a dagger offhand for a decrease in damage from their specific spec while getting a boost in yellow damage, but swords would probably not see a gain due to the nature of offhand sword spec procs.<br>
<br>
With normal basic slice and dice, for example:<br>
1.6 hasted to 1.23, average 1 CP proc per 6.15 seconds - 15 / 61.5 ~ 24% extra energy<br>
1.1 hasted to 0.85, average 1 CP proc per 4.25 seconds - 15 / 42.5 ~ 35% extra energy<br>

Roughly a 10% yellow damage gain, so rougly a 3.5-4% overall gain.  I believe that's about the advantage sword spec has currently, yes?<br>
<br>
If this were paired with a change to a 3-point opportunity, I think the specs would finally be pretty balanced.</div>

		<div id="post_message_520338">I don't think it's precisely fair to say that "most" daggers are 1.5 speed.  There's, what, 2 of them?  Tracker's Blade and Retainer's Blade?  There's 2 1.5 speed daggers, 2 1.3 speed daggers, and the rest (Messenger of Fate, Dirge, Feltooth Eviscerator, the PvP daggers...) are 1.4 speed; hence, "most" daggers are 1.4 speed, while "most" swords are 1.5 speed (with three exceptions which are 1.4, and the Blacksmithing Swords which are 1.6).  So the average dagger is faster than the average sword.<br>
<br>
Now, that said, it is true that they could make the difference larger, and that would certainly help; I'm not saying that I'd complain if they made some fixes via itemization.  I just think this is somewhat unlikely since historically Blizzard has preferred to fix the underlying mechanics of the class and leave itemization alone, presumably because changing the itemization can have unintended consequences for other classes, while fixing the class itself cuts to the heart of the issue; item fixes are usually only done when it's a blanket problem across the board for all classes (as was true for both the Haste buff and the Haste nerf).  So, without making any value judgements on which would work better in this case, I think it is more likely that they'll change the rogue mechanics rather than changing the items.<br>
<br>
On the whole, I think this is a case of Blizzard not fully understanding how large the speed effect was at first; Instant attack normalization was introduced because speed on MH weapons was too important, but OH Weapon Speed matters more than MH Weapon speed ever did now.  So my theory as to what happened is that they made a few fast weapons without fully appreciating how much of a difference it makes, and thus had to keep making fast weapons to allow the new itemization to remain competitive; hence, another change I might expect to see is Combat Potency changed to scale with weapon speed. If it granted, say, 10xWeaponSpeed instead of a flat 15 energy, it would reduce the massive influence of OH weapon speed to a more managable level.  This would, unfortuantely, nerf combat daggers relative to it's current strength, and it can't really afford the hit, which is perhaps one of the reasons it hasn't happened yet.<br>
<br>
Of course, for that matter, one could argue that Combat Daggers was a spec that Blizzard hadn't anticipated in the first place; looking at the trees, it seems to me that the original intent was that combat would get more use for SS builds, whereas dagger builds would tend to invest more deeply in assassination.  Whether this is true or not, Blizzard has certainly made changes to accomodate it's existance (Opportunity being moved down a tier from it's original position, and the new Aggression change, among other things), but I am forced to wonder if Blizzard would actually mind if Combat Daggers faded away to be replaced with SF Hybrid and Mutilate builds.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">If you don't mind the fact that every single rogue wants to be swords and all other weapon types might as well just be sharded as soon as they drop, then there is no problem right now.  However, I think we would benefit more by having a couple of specs using different weapon types, thereby allowing all rogues in a raid to get weapons in a timely fashion since they're not all going for the same thing.  And if you look at the changes I proposed, there are both buffs and nerfs, which would on the net put us about where we are on DPS.</div>

</div>I agree with you that it would be nice if all the specs were mathmatically even.  However, you are overstating things just a bit :P  The fury warrior in our raid was quite happy when the MH Fist off of Al'ar dropped.  Also, there are still plenty of rogues running around with felsteel longblades, many of which aren't on RP servers (which is the only reason I could think of having one that's not pure stupidity). Finally, you've stated before that a rogues DPS can vary widely even on the same fight with the same gear.  So other than the people that have really tried to put the time into the math, or taken advantage of other's work (thank you), most people will probably never put together a data set large enough to show that, say, swords is significantly different than daggers in DPS.<br>

</div>Overall, I think the idea of messing with daggers and making them 1.1 speed would influence things besides CP procs.  I can't remember the formula at the moment, but a shiv would be about 30 energy at that point?  I can imagine weird things with Arena's and rogues running around shiving instant poison for the CP stacks.<br>

</div>10xweapon speed is an interesting idea, I suppose that faster would still be better for poisons and shiving, but the change would make all the sword spec weaponsmiths happy I'm sure.  <br>
<br>
I wonder if part of the idea behind mutilate was to make that the new daggers build.<br>
<br>
Not to get too RP or anything but I think that it is true that people have very different visions of what a rogue is when they roll one.  I for one was thinking of a blademaster/fencing/swashbuckler type so I've always been happy with being swords.  My main wish was that we got some of the graphics that caster blades got, the prime example being the lightsabre looking weapon.  I've also read a post by someone that was playing an orc rogue that thought of his rogue as a thug and leveled maces.  Finally, I'm sure that many people think of rogues as dagger in the back, thief sort of character.  I happen to think of all of these a reason-able views of a rogue.  To some extent that fact that combat daggers is no longer THE dagger spec actually helps identify combat rogues as more of the upfront fighter/blade dancer type and leaves the assassination and shadow step build to be the dagger in the back trees.  In fact, given the current itemization (a pretty even mix of Maces, fists, daggers and swords) I would be quite upset if the only/best choice of weapon for all three trees was a dagger.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">1) Have OH Sword Spec proc OH hits instead of MH.  This would bring Sword Spec into balance with the other specs.<br>
2) Add SnD Rank 3, with base duration 12/15/18/21/24 seconds.  This would allow Dagger rogues to use a more efficient, less disruptable cycle.<br>
<br>
This would, coincidentally, also give Hemo rogues a better cycle (as currently they can't quite sustain 5s5r) - they could use 4s5r, which would also make them a slightly more stable spec for raiding.<br>
<br>
On the whole, it seems to me that this would address many of the current issues with spec balance.  I'm sure there are other ways of doing so, but this seems like the simplest way to me.<br>
<br>
<b>Edit:</b><br>
The alternative to #2 would be to bump Imp SnD up to 20/40/60%, which would have approximately the same effect overall; it would mean daggers would end up using a cycle more like 3s/3r, but that's acceptable.</div>

</div>It's true, some weapons can also be used by other classes, particularly fists and maces.  However, daggers seem to be primarily the province of rogues; they're too fast for shaman and fury warriors can only use them in the OH (and rarely do even there) because they're normalized at a faster speed than other weapons, thus gimping their instant attacks.  Rogues are really the only class that makes good use of daggers.  Consider:<br>
<br>
In Black Temple, there are 3 swords and 2 daggers<br>
In Hyjal, there is 1 sword and 2 daggers<br>
In SSC/TK, there is 1 sword and 2 daggers<br>
In Karazhan, there is 1 sword and 3 daggers<br>
In ZA, there are 2 swords and 3 daggers<br>
<br>
In every instance other than BT, there are twice as many dagger drops as sword drops - and even in BT, given that 2 of those swords are legendary drops off Illidan, the daggers are probably easier to come by.  How much more quickly could we upgrade our weapons if we could make use of all those daggers?  <br>
<br>
Regarding your point: it's true that not everyone is an avid theorycrafter.  Yet, in my experience, it's still true that they know some of these things.  The other rogues in my guild are utterly disdainful of spreadsheets, and yet, lets look at what weapons they're using:<br>
<br>
1) Warglaive/MG Quickblade<br>
2) Infamy/Savagery<br>
3) Infamy/Savagery<br>
4) Infamy/G Quickblade (recently having respecced from daggers with Shard of Azzinoth/Messenger of Fate)<br>
5) ToA/MG Quickblade (&lt;--me)<br>
<br>
For all their disdain of spreadsheets, they've universally decided to use swords over daggers.  So, clearly, they've realized something of the difference.<br>

		<div id="post_message_520963">I used to raid as swords with Spiteblade and S2 offhand, and I switched to daggers the day 2.2 was released.  Part of the reason was that I noticed my DPS had inexplicably tanked by about 200 points, and another part was I think it's ridiculous that every rogue wants to be swords.  I enjoy taking a spec that is widely considered to be second-rate and making it work well.<br>
<br>
Having successfully played combat daggers for a while now, in a guild dominated by sword rogues, I can think of a few small fixes that would work wonders for combat daggers.<br>
<br>
First, adding 40-50 armor penetration to each rank of Opportunity would provide a healthy damage increase that wouldn't really do anything to swords.  Sword builds can't squeeze that in, even Mutilate wouldn't take it; it's exclusively a combat dagger talent (in a raiding context) and so buffing it would all but guarantee its benefits would remain restricted to a single spec.<br>
<br>
Secondly, adding another component to Dagger Specialization (as was previously discussed) is a good idea.  A combat dagger rogue really can't squeeze sword spec into a build, so there's no fear of dual-speccing.  I wouldn't mind seeing some armor penetration on this talent also, or maybe even some expertise.  Dodged Backstabs are the bane of any combat dagger rogue, because they completely dismantle the combat rotations we use.  Fewer dodged Backstabs adds even more energy efficiency to a build already known for it, and allows it to improve upon its core advantage.<br>
<br>
Thirdly, a buff to Improved Backstab that incorporates a reduced energy cost component would be incredible.  Enough has been said about this already, so I won't elaborate.<br>
<br>
With regard to fists, I don't really know what can be done to fix it.  I do think that all specializations should be retooled such that the bonuses they provide only take effect if the rogue wields two weapons of the same type as their specialization.<br>
<br>
On a side note, I originally tried rationalizing that Blizzard hadn't given up on combat daggers because the Combat Potency graphic was a dagger.  I soon abandoned this belief, however, when I realized that the graphic for Sinister Strike is also a dagger :/</div>

<br>
In addition you have to be careful as to not just buff combat daggers because the gap between them and mutilate rogues is already large enough.<br>
<br>
Buff daggers in general so that it positively impacts both Mutilate and Combat Daggers.  And they need to not forget about Subtlety rogues who are already leaps and bounds behind warriors, shamans, and druids in terms of single target dps.<br>
<br>
My ideas are:<br>
1)  Change dagger normalization from 1.7 to 1.8.  This is about a small but easily manageable upgrade.<br>
2)  Reduce the penalty on Mutilate when mobs arent poisoned and buff the base dmg.  Currently its 100% dmg + 50% more against poisoned targets.  Change it to 125% dmg + 25% against poisoned targets.  Same max dmg, but smaller gap.  You don't want to really increase the max dmg of Mutilate because it might overbalance things in PvP.<br>
3)  Change Hemo to be based off AP, not wpn dmg.  That way it scales just as well with dagger rogues as it does sword rogues.<br>
4)  Reduce Opportunity to be 2 ranks instead of 5 with the same max value.  10% per rank.<br>
5)  Reduce Lethality to be 3 ranks instead of 5 with the same max value.  10% per rank.<br>
(Sword rogues already can easily get 5/5 Lethality but CD rogues cant.  This would allow them to max Opp and Lethality without losing Ruth/Relent).<br>
<br>
I am against moving Opp to the Combat or Assasination tree because it is a major part of Subtlety builds.<br>
<br>
Edit:  Changing the normalization, whether its 1.7 to 1.8 or even 1.9 would help with the scaling problems of BS vs SS and would have a small enough impact so you wouldnt have to worry about overpowering one build over another.<br>
<br>
End goal is to make this the order of best dps specs:<br>
1)  Combat Daggers<br>
2)  Combat Swords/Fists/Maces = Mutilate<br>
3)  Subtlety<br>
<br>
The difference between CD and CS should be small, like 2%.  Mutilate should be within 5%.  Subtlety should be within 10%.</div>

		<div id="post_message_521197">To be perfectly honest, sword specialization needs to be fixed.  With offhand procs causing main hand swings, Blizzard has created a great imbalance.  This is the biggest problem with it.  The gains by having a very fast weapon to proc Combat Potency is one thing, but swords gets to double-dip since the fast off-hand gets to also proc the majority of main hand swings.  With say a 1.5 speed offhand and a 2.5 speed main hand  62.5% of your sword spec procs are coming from the offhand.  This is the main reason why Latro's, being a relatively crappy weapon dps-wise, in combination with anything decent, rates as good as two decent daggers.<br>
<br>
As long as you have crazy interactions where offhands are proccing main hands outside of the energy generation cycle, you will never be able to properly balance the specs.  Maces and fists, using roughly the same combat techniques, will never be able to catch up as long as this inequity remains.  Sword spec needs to be fixed to balance things.  It's also not like combat daggers doesn't beat fury warriors already.<br>
<br>
The class I'm more worried about are hunters who seem to get buffs every patch and adding pet dps to their own are almost up there in dps.  They get that being able to stay at ranged, with mail armor, with a pet to keep mobs off them and able to deaggro with great frequency.</div>

</div>The problem with moving forward with sword spec as it is is that there is simply no way to bring other specs up to par without somehow invalidating the offhand penalty for them too. I sincerely doubt that the current situation with sword spec is intended, and in my opinion even if there weren't rogues suggesting it as a course of action, we would still be seeing them nerf offhand sword spec sometime in the near future.<br>
<br>
The best fix I can think of that will bring all rogue specs on par with one another would be to make Dual Wield Specialization reduce the offhand penalty to nothing and then to change offhand sword spec to only proc offhand attacks. This way, offhand sword spec doesn't scale so wildly out of control, but at the same time, doesn't lose huge amounts of damage and fall behind other specs.<br>
<br>
Of course, removing the 25% offhand penalty would be a pretty significant damage boost for all rogue specs (for my current gear, it would be a boost of ~107 DPS). For sword rogues, however, this would be tempered by the change to offhand sword spec; for */sword hybrid rogues, it would also be tempered by the loss of offhand sword spec; and for other single-spec rogues, it would be tempered by the fact that they are already lagging behind the top DPS spec. Perhaps I'm being short-sighted, but I don't necessarily see these things as being out of control.</div>

Given the normalized nature of Hemo and it's set energy cost, would changing it to a variable energy cost (similar to shiv, but with perhaps a lower energy cost) make it a viable for use with daggers?  You'd still end up with a higher damage per energy from a slow weapon, but you'd gain combo points at a higher rate with a fast weapon.  By changing it to a variable energy cost you'd lose damage/energy with slow weapons so I'm propose chanigng the attack to 125% weapon damage.<br>
<br>
If you set the energy cost to 15 + 10 * weapon speed a 2.8 attack speed will do 20% more damage per energy than a 1.8 attack speed dagger, but the dagger would accumulate 5 combo points 23% faster.

</div>To be perfectly clear: no one here is suggesting that rogues be nerfed.  No one here wants rogues to do less damage than fury warriors.  What I (and others) are proposing is a rebalancing.  When you look at the rogue specializations and abilities, there are certain elements - like OH sword spec procs - that are more powerful than one might expect; these mechanics prove exceedingly difficult to balance around.  Thus, the proposal is not to make rogues do less damage; the proposal is to spread the damage potential currently loaded into one talent and spread it among abilities that can be taken by most raiding rogues, to level the playing field.  I fail to see the problem with suggesting a balanced set of changes with some buffs and some nerfs that will ultimately allow half a dozen different specs to realize the damage potential that currently is the sole province of sword rogues, but apparently there's quite a few people here who object to it.<br>
<br>
So, returning to my fundamental points:<br>
<br>
1) Fist spec, dagger spec, mace spec, and combat hemo builds are relatively well-balanced against each other at the moment.<br>
2) Sword spec is significantly more powerful than any of these options.<br>
3) The source of Sword Spec's power is that while it is extremely well balanced for MH attacks; for a single weapon, 5% chance of an extra attack with that weapon is very comparable to 5% crit with that weapon.  However, your OH weapon generates MH procs, which a) harnesses the speed differential of your weapons causing these procs to do almost twice as much damage as they otherwise would, and b) ignores the OH damage penalty.  Hence, while OH sword spec would be of comparable power to the other specs on the OH if each OH proc with a 1.5 speed weapon did .75 times the damage of a 1.5 speed weapon, instead it is doing the full damage of a 2.7 speed weapon, and hence 2.4 times as much damage as would reasonably be defined as balanced.<br>
<br>
Thus, the fundamental solution to the above is that sword spec it 2.5 times better on the OH than any other weapon specialization; this is why sword spec beats all other specs.  At the moment, there are two solutions proposed to resolve this:<br>
<br>
1) Cause OH sword spec to proc OH attacks, and increase Imp SnD to 20%/40%/60%<br>
<br>
or<br>
<br>
2) Make some permutation of changes to talent specs that allow daggers rogues to get full Ruthlessness and Lethality, and reitemize a bunch of OH daggers, and make some change that no one is quite sure about that somehow brings OH fists and maces up to spec without imbalancing MH fist/mace spec, and, oh, Hemo will probably need a buff too to keep up.  Oh, and all those changes are probably going to have some consequences for other classes and for PvP, so we'll probably need to tweak the mechanics of some other talents to keep things balanced for PvP, and...<br>
<br>
Now, I'm not going to say that option 2 doesn't work.  There probably is a way to do it... but it's certainly a heck of a lot messier.  So my question would be:<br>
<br>
If both of the above solutions yield the same endpoint, i.e., bringing all combat specs plus hemo into rough balance without significantly decreasing rogue DPS as a whole, which is the more elegant solution and, hence, which is Blizzard more likely to do?<br>

</div>I'm going to have to call BS on this one.  The only reason swords scale better than daggers is sword spec.  My proof?<br>
<br>
I entered into the spreadsheet a set of pre-25man gear.  Every single item was from Karazhan or earlier; the weapons used are Arena Season 1.  The damage numbers for Combat Daggers versus Combat Fists are as follows:<br>
<br>
Combat Fists: 1391<br>
Combat Daggers: 1381<br>
<br>
So, 10 DPS different.  Then, keeping the same buffs, I replaced the Arena 1 weapons with Arena 2 weapons, and upgraded all the gear from best-in-Kara to best-in-BT.  The single best item in every slot - 4/5 T6, the works.  The damage numbers for that?<br>
<br>
Combat Fists: 1767<br>
Combat Daggers: 1757<br>
<br>
...*still* 10 DPS different.  There is no appreciable scaling difference between SS builds and BS builds.  Sword spec scales a little better since it benefits from hit and crit as well as just AP; but that's purely an artifact of Sword Spec itself, and has little to nothing to do with the fundamentals of SS builds versus BS builds.</div>

</div>Agreed.  I think the problem most of them have, though, is that by lowering sword spec to meet the other specs where they currently sit, you'd see BM hunters/Fury Warriors (especially after 2.3) rise above us on the dmg meter.  I am against that whole-heartedly.  At the same time though, I don't see why a rogue shouldn't be able to spec whatever he so chooses (besides deep assass) and do relatively close dmg.  Also, think of it from an RP standpoint and a logical standpoint, "Why the eff would an offhand swing proc a mh swing?"  That is an obviously messed up mechanic that has led to a disparity in the specs.<br>
<br>
But, once you fix that and maybe add in the +snd %, you'd still see most rogues (sword rogues at least) drop another 50+dps which is horrible in relation to other classes gaining dps.  Again, retooling the specs would be nice, having an almost equal chance to use any spec and still top dmg meters, the problem is, as a non sword rogue, you probably won't top the dmg meters.  <br>
<br>
oh and someone said "but that would be too imbalanced in PvP" about mutilate and raising it's base dmg.... Thank you for following Blizzard into their doomed attempts at trying to balance PvE and PvP through the talent trees.  I've never seen a more idiotic thing than trying to retool and rework specs and weapons and realizing "oh, that won't work for our already broken PvP, guess we'd better change it so PvP'ers dont cry...even if it screws over PvE'ers".    /sigh</div>

</div>Weighted and Defensive give a higher value to stamina and dodge (and probably a couple other things I'm too lazy to think of right now).  The reason it suggests agi gems instead of hit when you switch to weighted is because Hit is only worth slightly more DPS than Agi is, so when the value of dodge is taken in to account agi ends up coming out on top.  That doesn't necessarely mean it's the best choice for you, it's just a suggestion :-)</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Wow, why are your rogues so scared of them making Sword Spec work correctly? No other spec currently gains benefits to the main when when that spec is only used with the offhand. You can't get 5% crit with a MH sword and an offhand Dagger/Fist. So why should sword spec work that way? It isn't a nerf when you are fixing a broken mechanic. I would think most of you here would realize that, but i guess not.</div>

</div>Actually I think that is a very good point.  When I read what sword specialization does in the tooltip, I do not think offhand attacks get mainhand procs.  I think that you get 5% more white attacks of each type.  The tooltip itself is misleading or the mechanic isn't working as intended.  Regardless, either the tooltip or the mechanic needs fixing.<br>
<br>
It should be noted that I take this position having recently switched to swords.  Just from soloing utility, I think it unlikely I'd switch back to daggers even for a 5% damage advantage.  The increase in soloing capability isn't even comparable.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Sorry if If I missed something, but how exaclty the Offensive/Defensive/Weighted Total tool work? Because if I put it in WT the spreadsheet says that AGI gives me more AP than Hit. But on Offensive I should go Hit all out. Is there something about dodge related?<br>

</div>The Offensive setting makes the spreadsheet look only at the offensive gains, such as crit and ap from agi.  The defensive and weighted settings value agi for crit, ap, dodge and armor.  So Agi will get valued more in weighted and defensive than in offensive.  I'm not sure what values it is using for weighting, just that defensive will weight more.  Also I personally use the offensive setting and then compare the agi and stam on gear afterwards.<br>

		<div id="post_message_521726">There are so many fundamental issues with these bogus straw man arguments some of you insist on making.<br>
<br>
(1) Some of us don't agree that sword rogues need a nerf. It's the damage of sword rogues -- as things stand -- that currently justify our presence in raids. We're not interested in seeing that damage reduced any more. If it's 5% more damage than dagger rogues are doing, figure out a way to improve daggers 5%.<br>
<br>
(2) Some of us don't agree that the mechanic is broken at all. It's been working this way for a long time. When the swing timer was being reset, it was safe to conclude the mechanic was broken (fixed). When the proc was proc-ing another proc it was reasonable to conclude the mechanic was broken (fixed). That the OH can proc the effect is fine. When Mongooose procs on my offhand, I get haste and 120agi, not some nerfed version of Mongoose because it's offhand.<br>
<br>
(3) Some of us don't agree that hybrid-spec use exists is a problem that requires nerfing sword spec. We've proposed alternatives to make hybrid-spec use uninteresting. So we can now simply disregard that strawman.<br>
<br>
(4) Some of us don't agree that the proposed solutions are the only ones or simple ones. In fact, if you read the above ideas, they often move horribly into the complex. "Remove the dual wield penalty" and then fix that elsewhere? Change multiple talent tiers in multiple trees? Occam's Razor need not apply. I have no interest in the second-order effects those will create and the need to nerf thiem later.<br>
<br>
And all due respect to Aldriana, the notion that those are the only two solutions and that by ruling out the second of them you have hit on the only possibly solution to this "problem" is not really easy to take seriously. You are capable of crafting so many good arguments, claiming some paired change between OH procs and Slice and Dice is the lone solution is off.<br>
<br>
(5) Some of us don't agree that many different talent specs should be about equal in their damage. Surely no one would argue that fire needs to equal frost needs to equal arcane after all this time with regard to mages. There are tradeoffs in WoW. You pick daggers, you can ambush people for insane crits. You pick swords, you get the best single-target, stand-around damage. Sorry, but this isn't broken, it just *is*.<br>
<br>
(6) Some of us see no reason to "fix" what isn't broken. We don't want a change. We don't need a change. There just isn't evidence outside of here that people are screaming and clamoring for this change. There are so many game issues and rogue issues that exceed the fact that for the moment sword rogues are ahead of dagger rogues. An itemization change could alter that calculus in a second. A fight that requires the added stuns of mace spec could alter that calculus in a second. <br>
<br>
We are asking you to acknowledging that what is now is indeed what is now. We feel that our damage is hardly so far ahead of other classes -- never mind other rogues -- that it's somehow overpowered, especially after the haste nerfs. We don't want to see yet another reduction in our dps simply because those of you wielding daggers do less damage. The fact is that fists have been the bastard child of rogue weapons forever, due to itemization as much as anything (i.e. there are and always have been few fists). Maces have their place because of extraordinary PVP benefits. For that, they might do less damage in PVE. Fine. Daggers offer tremendous unique benefits in ambush and backstab. <br>
<br>
The game is just not broken there. And the slight superiority of swords to daggers in PVE raid context is just fine, thank you. Dagger rogues can do things in PVP and 5-man that sword rogues cannot and vice versa.</div>

2) Make some permutation of changes to talent specs that allow daggers rogues to get full Ruthlessness and Lethality, and reitemize a bunch of OH daggers, and make some change that no one is quite sure about that somehow brings OH fists and maces up to spec without imbalancing MH fist/mace spec, and, oh, Hemo will probably need a buff too to keep up.  Oh, and all those changes are probably going to have some consequences for other classes and for PvP, so we'll probably need to tweak the mechanics of some other talents to keep things balanced for PvP, and...</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</div>Not quite sure if solution #1 will shorten the gap as more attacks from OH result in more Combat Potency procs thus more energy. Have you run any tests to see what happens if you make that change with a 1.4 OH sword for example? <br>
<br>
Also on solution #2: forgive me for saying so but i think you are pushing it out of proportion. Freeing 2 talent points to enable Combat Dagger rogue to gain full Lethality / Ruthlessness is neither messy or difficult. Plus the introduction of a decent 1.3 OH dagger into the loot pool. Anything further than that IS messy but also unneeded.<br>
<br>
And to all the debaters out there: if Combat Swords had a 10-20 DPS difference (up or down) from other speccs nobody would make any discussion at this point. But the fact remains that atm it vastly surpasses that number, which forces all raiding rogues to grab a sword sooner or later.</div>

Just because it's been working as it has doesn't mean it's working as intended. <br>
Shamans cried when windfury was fixed.<br>
Anyway if you happened to miss it, the argument was that with any other spec you don't get a offhand "spec" proccing on mainhand. <br>
Off-hand Mace does not add +5% critical damage to your main hand if your main-hand is not a Mace. <br>
Off-hand Dagger or Fist does not add +5% crit to your main hand if your main-hand is not a Dagger or a Fist.<br>
Off-hand Sword has 5% chance to proc a extra attack. For some reason it is a main-hand attack, <b>and</b> if your main-hand is not a Sword you still gain the attack on your main-hand. <br>

</div>I haven't seen anyone suggesting 30/0/31 to be buffed to be raid viable, so I'm assuming you're talking about Combat Daggers. In which case I must take a range check on my comment to (3) <br>
"Wait what?"<br>
Traditional Combat Daggers (15/41/5) is pretty much the worst spec to pvp with. Have you even tried it?<br>
I mean "insane" Ambush crits? Combat Daggers doesn't go deep enough in Subtlety to pick up Imp. Ambush, nor does it have full lethality. <br>
I fail to see what you meant by that. <br>
Perhaps 20/0/41 would offer that? But then that spec has no relevancy to PvE?<br>
<br>
As for the notion that swords are picked since they offer best single-target dps? <br>
I guess it's true with TBC swords has changed from the 2nd place (while also being the best overall build) for damage dealing to the 1st place of damage dealing (as well as retaining it's best overall status) build.<br>
Combat Daggers which had the edge on the damage pre-TBC and was considered the "Best Single-Target dps build" has now lost both standings and I'd say trails far behind swords. <br>
A lot of people I know tried Combat Daggers with the start of TBC, myself included. The build even had better itemization from PvE: (Malchazeen+Searing Sunblade vs Spiteblade/Hope Ender+Latro's). But Swords beat it and most of the high-end rogues I know have pretty much converted to Swords.<br>
So I'd people chose Swords because they lacked a better dagger alternative.<br>

</div>See this is where I'd say you're wrong. <br>
WoW you see is in the end, a game of math. If you assume equal variables then you can calculate the theoretical maximum values for each spec/attribute/etc. <br>
And it's been proven over and over again that under equal conditions Combat Swords does better than Combat Daggers. That is including theoretical "skill".<br>
Which yes in the real world might not always be "equal". But that doesn't change the facts, nor does it change the math behind the facts.<br>
<br>
As for your statement that there is no evidence outside here that sword spec is too "strong". Well I match it with my own. There's no evidence to the contrary. So until someone actually does some <b>actual</b> data gathering and analyzing. <br>
Which I guess it wouldn't be that hard with the help of the Armory. <br>
Just how many percent of the high-end rogue population is using swords? <br>
Of course then you could also want to question why they use swords over other specs? <br>
But somehow, I think most of them would have the same answer: "Because swords are the best dps spec at the moment."<br>

</div>Please. Do not use superlatives. <br>
Perhaps Pre-TBC Fists were rare. This is no longer the case. I can't come up with a reason why Fists should be inferior to Swords. If you can think of any reasonable ones. Feel free to share?<br>
<br>
Maces are hardly "extraordinary". They are definitely not the end-all be all PvP Spec. Sure Mace-Stuns are beneficial but I doubt most games are won because someone favored maces over swords or fists for PvP.<br>
<br>
I can't think of a single reason why a 15/41/5 rogue would use Ambush.<br>
And Backstab? Has Positional requirement, a higher energy cost and much worse sustainability (in dps cycles) in erratic environments. So I fail to see the "tremendous unique" benefits that you mention. I can see huge downsides for what essentially is a inferior spec to swords. <br>

</div>No. It's not fine. 20/41 Combat Swords out-preforms 15/41/5 in each aspect that you suggest. PVP, 5-man, 25-man. I'd add Solo-farming/question to that as well.<br>
<br>
So please, elaborate on why you believe that it is "just fine" for combat swords to be superior to combat daggers in EVERY aspect with no redeeming qualities.<br>
<br>
Because at the moment it seems to me that your rigidness and unwillingness to change from Combat Swords is clouding your judgment. Am I wrong?<br>
<br>
EDIT: Actually I'm not sure this is the place to discuss any possible changes to sword spec. Such ideas should be better suited for the rogue theorycraft topic I think?</div>

		<div id="post_message_521888">Why should <u>combat</u> fists and <u>combat</u> swords differ at all? There is no change in play style. Neither offers a unique benefit to PvP or PvE. They are completely the same, until you see the difference in damage output. Personally, I think Blizzard's original plan was to have the two interchangeable, they probably thought combat maces should be that way as well.<br>
<br>
As I see it, picking between combat fist and sword spec should only be a choice of which weapons you get first, or which one look the most bad ass. Combat daggers should have very slight DPS advantage on a stationary single target fight, and combat maces should fall very slightly behind.<br>
<br>
Now, should overall rogue dps be reduced to balance this out? Of course not. A damage reduction of sword spec, added to a overall increase in rogue dps would work just fine, IMO. <br>
<br>
Really, whats so bad about having a greater choice of which weapons to use?</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">There are so many fundamental issues with these bogus straw man arguments some of you insist on making.<br>
<br>
(1) Some of us don't agree that sword rogues need a nerf. It's the damage of sword rogues -- as things stand -- that currently justify our presence in raids. We're not interested in seeing that damage reduced any more. If it's 5% more damage than dagger rogues are doing, figure out a way to improve daggers 5%.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</div>If you'd read what I actually posted, you'd have seen that I was not advocating reducing sword rogue DPS in any way shape or form.  I was advocating reducing sword rogue DPS by 5%, and then increasing *all* rogue DPS, sword and otherwise, by 5%, thus resulting in sword rogues doing *exactly* the same amount of DPS they are doing now, but allowing all the other specs to also do as much.<br>
<br>

	<tr>
		<td class="alt2" style="border:1px inset">
			
				(2) Some of us don't agree that the mechanic is broken at all. It's been working this way for a long time. When the swing timer was being reset, it was safe to conclude the mechanic was broken (fixed). When the proc was proc-ing another proc it was reasonable to conclude the mechanic was broken (fixed). That the OH can proc the effect is fine. When Mongooose procs on my offhand, I get haste and 120agi, not some nerfed version of Mongoose because it's offhand.
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</div>I assert that it's broken only to the extent that it creates a balance nightmare.  And it does.<br>
<br>
And, in reality, Mongoose *is* weaker on your OH; it only maintains about half the uptime that your MH Mongoose generates... as opposed to Sword Spec which generates almost twice as much damage on your OH as it does on your MH.<br>
<br>

				(4) Some of us don't agree that the proposed solutions are the only ones or simple ones. In fact, if you read the above ideas, they often move horribly into the complex. "Remove the dual wield penalty" and then fix that elsewhere? Change multiple talent tiers in multiple trees? Occam's Razor need not apply. I have no interest in the second-order effects those will create and the need to nerf thiem later.<br>
<br>
And all due respect to Aldriana, the notion that those are the only two solutions and that by ruling out the second of them you have hit on the only possibly solution to this "problem" is not really easy to take seriously. You are capable of crafting so many good arguments, claiming some paired change between OH procs and Slice and Dice is the lone solution is off.
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</div>Again, I think you missed my point.  The point I was attempting to make with that example was very similar to your overall point here; most of the solutions being proposed that *don't* involve a nerf to sword spec are horribly convoluted, and require 10 separate buffs, each of which carefully crafted so as not to affect swords but increase the damage output of other specs, will be loaded with unintended consequences that would in turn need to be fixed, and so on.  Meanwhile, by coupling a slight sword spec nerf with a slight rogue buff, you bring them all into balance with only 2 simple changes.  Is this the only way to fix it?  No.  Are there other buffs and other ways of nerfing sword spec that would yield the same result?  For sure.  However, my point remains:  rebalancing rogues to be less reliant on sword spec is a far far easier fix than trying to leave Sword Spec the way it is and buff all the other talents to match, and, as such, is a) more likely to actually occur and b) less likely to introduce other balance issues that would need to be fixed down the line.<br>
<br>
Now, if you disagree that the specs should be equal - that's a totally separate issue, and I can definitely see the argument there.  On the other hand, I would argue that your analogy to mage specs is invalid.  If, for instance, fire spec vastly outdamaged any other raiding mage spec, but all the caster itemization in raid instances had only +frost damage on it, do you think the mages might perhaps complain?  I view this to be analagous to our situation.  There is one raid spec that is clearly superior to all others, and almost no itemization to support it, but tons of itemization to support inferior specs.  Thus, the case can be made that it would be advantageous to us, as a class, to have the ability to make use of that itemization.<br>
<br>
You're welcome to disagree, of course - that's why we have discussion forums.  I merely assert that *if* one wishes to bring the specs into parity, the most elegant solution proposed to date is to couple a slight nerf to sword spec with a matching buff to the class, and frankly I can't really see how there's an argument about that.</div>

		<div id="post_message_522280">Due respect intended but I re-read 1223, and you seem to say "nerf swords, add SnD time to help daggers". If you meant, nerf swords a bit and buff all rogues so that sword rogue dps is unchanged then fine. I agree that's reasonable. I don't agree there *needs* to be DPS equivalence, but I don't have a problem with DPS equivalence -- except with maces, which have a very weird, non-PVE benefit and therefore should either get a new bonus, or do less damage in PVE in aggregte. <br>
<br>
Now, to say that the existing itemization ought to be more useful and therefore we ought to have spec changes to make it so is again something I don't see a problem with. But that said, outside of places like this, I'm quite certain all those fists and daggers are indeed getting used. You see in post 1258 that some presumably somewhat high-end guild has 3 rogues who are clearly spec-ed in an inferior manner -- i.e. they don't make use of swords. And yet they invite 5 rogues to raids (which I personally find insane, but whatever works for them). If the poster was suggesting his guild's non-sword rogues match the damage of the sword rogues, then we again learn that skill &gt;&gt; theorycrafting. If he isn't saying that, then apparently, the inferior damage of non-sword rogues is fine for his guild.<br>
<br>
My point, which he somehow seems to be missing, is worth reiterating: Rogues at sword dps levels are sufficiently the best single target dpsers to justify being in raids at all. We have a nice, yet reasonable margin over other classes and enough fights where we can sit around and slice and dice away. If we are nerfed by 5% in damage, no serious theorycrafting guild is going to bother with rogues. And that's a very dangerous change to be advocating -- or even hiniting at.<br>
<br>
Blizzard has a way of taking these ideas and making them reality. Let's be awfully careful in what they are being fed. I'd rather have the imbalance in favor of swords persis --  swords are the best, but the other specs still allow people to top the meters -- than see a class-wide nerf after the damage done by the haste nerf. <br>
<br>
I find the argument in 1258 non-persuasive. You want me to prove the negative with regard to it being overpowered? Go to the soapbox -- aka the WoW forums -- and show me the clamor over the overpoweredness of sword spec. It's just not there. You can armory all day and show me that most elite guild rogues are swords right now and I'll again say so what? When Rag was the endgame, all elite mages were frost. Raiding hunters find one spec or the other superior at a given moment. That's always the case in WoW. There isn't perfect frost/fire/arcane balance in mages at the moment. There isn't perfect affliction/demo balance in locks. Etc. etc.<br>
<br>
And since I've mashed two totally different posts to reply to into one, I'm going to explain one thing again (though it's crystal clear above). "Off-hand Sword has 5% chance to proc a extra attack. For some reason it is a main-hand attack, and if your main-hand is not a Sword you still gain the attack on your main-hand. "<br>
<br>
I know. And so the proposal above was simple: End hybrid spec abuse. If the MH isn't a sword, sword spec can't proc from it. Done.<br>
<br>
The "strawman" is the notion you can't fix that problem without nerfing swords when in fact you can fix that problem with about 10 lines of code.<br>
<br>
Now Aldriana, having said that in response to Grunge, let me reiterate that I don't have a problem fixing the rest of the issue. But I'm simply not persuaded it's particularly necessary. Sword itemization is mediocre and yet you can get a S2 arena offhand in no time to upgrade Latro's and that'll keep you just fine. You can get a Vindictors or Arena weapon, hope for the Talon and move on. I wish there was more out there, but I'm not sure how this is any different than the same pathetic situation in vanilla. Krol.. wait forever... Brutaltiy... wait forever ... CTS. It was about a year between Krol and CTS for me. Blizzard doesn't much like to hand out weapon upgrades for whatever reason and I presume that's why many of us went to the arena to get them (they aren't perfect, but the S2 MH --&gt; Vindicators for me and after 6 months of not getting a Spiteblade, I deserved something).<br>
<br>
If the daggers and fists in SSC/TK are getting DE-ed, they're in good company. So much of that loot is borderline/sidegrade material it is what it is. Our shadow priest got the one item she needs... Our survival hunter waits on the 1-2 items she needs (and this across all 10 bosses). <br>
<br>
There are so many huge issues in WoW, this isn't one of them. At least as far as I'm concerned. And in this case, I think I speak for the majority. There are endless screams in the WoW forums about this warlock talent or that, about warrior overpoweredness in PVP or weakness in tanking for PVE. The "ZOMG sword rogues are OP" chorus is a pretty small one.</div>

<br>
Sword/sword is fine.<br>
Fist/sword is fine.<br>
I couldn't care less about the Subtelty tree. If they wanna buff it, buff it with extra pvp skills.<br>
Mutilate, I don't know what to think about it. I haven't seen many mutilate rogues. Maybe it could use some buffs.<br>
<br>
How to fix combat daggers ? Or combat fists ?<br>
<br>
Some suggestions:<br>
*) Improve the the dagger specialization to give up to 10% increased crit chance (6-10 or 2/4/6/8/10).<br>
*) Or improve the dagger and fist spec to give 1-5% aura *per weapon*. If you wear 2 daggers or fists, you get 10% increased critrating aura on both weapons. It would make offhand daggers and fist weapons certainly as viable as offhand swords.<br>
*) Decrease the cost of backstab. Maybe to 55 energy. Or 50 energy. Decrease it as much as is need to make similar geared dagger rogues do 5-10% more damage on stationary targets than sword/first rogues.<br>
*) Implement both last 2 suggestions<br>
*) Increase the dps of daggers further above the dps of swords found in the same instance. Still, while everyone agrees that swords are nicer, it isn't really easy to find anything above a Vindicator's Brand. You need luck to get a better sword. You need a lot of luck before you can outfit 4 rogues in your raid with Talons.<br>
<br>
There are many ways to do this. Simple ways. Ways that allows Blizzard to precisely buff dps to where it should be.<br>
<br>
The problem with daggers is this. A rogue can surprise his opponents in pvp (esp while ganking). Therefor he can stay behind a target until it is dead. Ambush/backstab/backstab gives great burst damage. If you increase dagger rogue's backstab even more than it is today, ganking becomes even simpler. 90% of Blizzard's customers wouldn't like that. Pvp is the limiting factor dagger rogue's pve dps.</div>

Alot of us predicted this during the TBC beta, even though the fact that OH daggers were way faster than OH swords made the gap to look slightly smaller than what it is now.<br>
<br>
Suggestions have been enough, even though I don't see blizzard actually making any real changes anytime soon.<br>
<br>
-Opportunity. Either get rid of it or make it a 2 or 3 points talent.<br>
-Lethality. *the* talent designed to work best with backstab. Funny enough, backstab rogues can't grab it fully.<br>
-SnD. There is no reason why this shouldn't be longer. Make improved backstab also increase the base duration by 5 sec for each rank, or just add a new rank.<br>
-Energy cost. Add a talent in combat which gives you 10 energy after each special attack critical strike. OR, make the white critical strikes have a chance to restore 5 energy. Both of those suggestions give a edge to daggers.<br>
-Base damage: Backstab's non crit damage is simply too low compared to SS. Either increase the base damage or increase the critical chance. (12% per rank instead of 10%).<br>
<br>
Any of the above will help backstab rogues to get back to where they really should be.</div>

Opportunity. This is a must for combat backstab builds, but it costs 5 points, and is in a different tree. If every dagger user takes a specific talent, doesnt that indicate something to blizzard? Lethality being the single talent that backstab builds shine the most, why can you not max it without gimping on lethality? It makes no sense.<br>

</div>So I guess Combat Daggers (15/41/5) is an Offbuild now?<br>
<br>
That ignorance is the same that midici spouts in his long dribble. Yes, I've gone to being an ass, sorry, some people don't understand otherwise.<br>
<br>
Combat builds are what? A cp generator + SnD based to get finishers.  They also require a fast OH to gain more combat potency procs and thus more dmg done from specials.<br>
<br>
Swords is a combat build.  Daggers is a combat build.  Both require a cp generator (SS or BS) + SnD uptime to reach a finisher.  They both require a fast OH to proc extra energy to create more dmg from specials.<br>
<br>
Swords allows for the OH swing to proc an MH attack.  It allows for the MH to proc a MH attack.  Does that seem logical, at all?  From a non-biased position, no person can logically say that having a weaker weapon do as much dmg as the stronger weapon is "working as intended".  <br>
<br>
Daggers adds 5% crit when wielding in the MH AND allows for +30% to crit on all BS's.  This means that a 30% crit rogue now crits 60% of his BS's.  Seems like a grand idea, until you look at equally geared sword and dagger rogues and see who comes out on top, but that's not the point of my post. (I would also point out that it's funny that fists also recieve 5% more crit and yet don't get any bonus to SS dmg or crit rate and is expected to level with swords).<br>
<br>
<br>
Mutilate, Hemo, Deep Sub and maces all have their place.  Whether its survivability, control, PvP Viability or world-ganking fun, all have a role OUTSIDE of 1 on 1 dps.  <br>
<br>
Swords allows for amazing 1 on 1 boss dmg, no matter where you are positioned on the boss.  It also allows for easy ganking in the World environment, as well as a completely viable PvP spec for most rogues.  <br>
<br>
Daggers is pretty amazing 1 on 1 boss dmg, only when stationed behind the target and he doesn't move.  You also have longer cycles meaning less SnD/Finisher up-time if the boss encounter isn't stagnant.  You have a CP Generator that costs 20 more energy than swords and does marginally more damage.  Also, the biggest point, when have you seen a 15/41/5 rogue running around AMBUSH BS BS people? They move away, you wasted energy on the Ambush, and even with 2 ticks you'll be lucky to get back behind them to BS BS again. <br>
<br>
I'm a sword rogue, waiting on our first ToA drop so that I can upgrade from Spiteblade.  I was combat daggers and hated it, so I went swords before the big "SWORDS IS WAYY BETTER".  I am still an advocate of swords being amazing dps, I love them, but don't think that daggers shouldnt equal or surpass our dps.  That's ignorance.  If a spec brings almost no other utility to the user, shouldn't he be gifted with excellent damage?  It follows the same line as overall rogue dps: If a rogue brings no other utility to the raid, but his dps and is forced to stand in melee range (more dmg done to him), shouldn't he be rewarded with more damage?  <br>
<br>
If they made the OH proc OH attacks and decreased the cost of a BS slightly or offered a faster OH dagger, possible upgraded <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302195137/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=29275"><span  ><span class="purplename">[Searing Sunblade]</span></span></a> with ~100dps and increased the base BS dmg, I think you'd see them jump up a little on the dps charts and give rogues a chance to either wield daggers or swords and know they will be top dps.</div>

<u>The whole and <b>PRIMARY</b> point behind having separate weapon and talent specializations is to offer flexibility in play style.</u>  If you're asking for all weapons to perform the same DPS, no matter the situation, then you might as well lose the weapons spec talents and give everyone 5% more crit or something stupid.<br>
<br>
I am a player who agrees that each Weapon Spec should have it's own Strengths and Weaknesses in PvP and PvE.  I agree that some weapons should excel at PvP but not at PvE and vise versa.  That, to me, is a part of class balance, even if the weapon has a suitable PvE/PvP spec.<br>
<br>
Aldriana, If you balance all weapons the same DPS in PvE, you will still nullify some weapons from PvP usefulness and continue this absurd sword vs. dagger debate.  With talents such as Mutilate it's obvious that Blizzard intended daggers to have builds advantageous to PvP, Sword and Fist have no such specialized builds.<br>
<br>
The sooner all rogues accept that certain weapons and builds offer strengths and weakness to the different play styles, the sooner this debate can end.</div>

<br>
Sword Specialization Rank 5 <br>
 <br>
Gives you a 5% chance to get an extra attack on the same target after hitting your target with your Sword. <br>

The wording is very clear.  it doesnt say anything like...<br>
<br>
Gives you a 5% chance to get an extra attack with the same weapon on the same target after hitting your target with your Sword. <br>
<br>
<br>
Imho (and I am a noob), it doesnt look like a broken mechanic. <br>
<br>
Lastly, I agree with fingers that I don't want every spec to be balanced.</div>

		<div id="post_message_522924">This debate is getting really aggrivating.  It's obviously not going to come to any conclusion, most people aren't even comprehending the previous responses before blurting out their own opinion.  On top of that it's almost entirely drawing this thread off subject.  I'll come back in a couple weeks when this thread has stopped being a whine fest on how badly rogues shouldn't be nerfed in any way, ever.  News flash, we've been OP since 2.1.  We have crazy survivability, crazy dps, legendary weapons are auto-assigned to us and we have 3 guaranteed raid slots in almost every top end raiding guild in the world.  Say thank you very much and count your blessings, it's a great time to be a rogue.<br>
<br>
Be back in a couple weeks.</div>

		<div id="post_message_522939">Ok, I've read every page here, and I can't seem to find a link to a rogue gear list. <br>
I know the spreadsheet is here but thats more for comparison of actual raiding gear. <br>
I'm lvling a rogue and need a good gear list. <br>
Anyone know of a gear list?</div>
