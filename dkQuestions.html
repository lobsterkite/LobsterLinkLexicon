You're still expected to make a reasonable effort to find the answer yourself by searching and reading the threads and making use of spreadsheets and any other tools that may be available. If, however, you're fairly confident that your question is not easily answered with available information, but don't think it will generate sufficient discussion to require it's own thread, this is the place to ask.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_976652"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->You lose a lot dual-wielding as anything but tri-spec. Especially with unholy -- scourge strike represents a large part of your damage. You also gain absolutely nothing from runeforges, as you'd use 4% parry on a 2h and 2x 2% parry on 1h's.<br>
<br>
*edit*: to clarify on tri-spec.<br>
<br>
Trispec is a build which focuses on two things: Howling Blast w/ Killing Machine, and Necrosis/Blood Caked Blades. It's generally used as a DPS build instead of a tanking build, more on that later.<br>
<br>
The strength of trispec is in it's lack of weapon-damage dependent damage -- Two blood strikes, a plague strike and an oblit or two every 20 seconds. What it loses in weapon damage, it makes up for in Howling Blast and BCB. Due to the nature of killing machine, a Slow/Fast dual-wield setup will have it constantly, to the point where you'll be surprised when Howling Blast doesn't crit. At the same time, your fast offhand will generate a lot of Blood Caked Blade procs, which associate to the main hand (think rogue swordspec). Necrosis, at the same time, increases your autoattack damage by about 10%.<br>
<br>
The reason I said this is a DPS build: Parrygibbing. For trispec to work, you would be using, optimally, 2.6-1.5 MH-OH. This generates 1.05 autoattacks per second before Windfury Totem. On top of this, you have 5 strike attacks every 20 seconds and blood caked blade procs also throwing out. A lot of stuff to parrygib yourself with.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I think you're just misunderstanding him. Xelo's saying that the DW-3spec is not good for tanking because of parry-gibbing: more attacks -&gt; more parries. (If you don't understand about parry-haste, just disregard the comment and trust him).<br>
<br>
Since you wouldn't gain anything from a second runeforge (all you'd gain is the tanking stats on a pair of tanking one-handers), The extra damage from parry-hasting the boss you're tanking is a deal-breaker (not to mention that the strength of the build is in how well it scales with dps stats, which you're a little short on in tanking gear).<br>

</div>No. The losses are too many - parry 'gibbing', lower base threat on everything, rune striking's cost goes up (the slower the weapon, the cheaper it is to keep every swing a Rune Strike).<br>

I'm no expert, but from what i've read in this forums, Frost DK can put some serious burst damage, also if im not mistaken they benefit more from crit rating than the other 2 trees.<br>
<br>
Frost is by no means the best for top DPS but when they start critting its going to hurt alot.<br>
<br>
imo, all DK's no matter what tree they choose should go with a 2H.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Scourge Strike replaces Obliterate.<br>
<br>
- Obliterate requires 13 points in Frost to be good. Otherwise, it drops your diseases hard. The typical end-game unholy build (17/0/54) obviously doesn't have that.<br>
- Obliterate is mitigated by armor. Scourge Strike is magical damage that is not mitigated by armor.<br>
- Scourge Strike benefits from Ebon Plague. Oblit doesn't.<br>
<br>
Pestilence creates new maximum duration diseases on nearby targets. It doesn't refresh on main target on the cast. You can bounce them back and forth from two, but that's non-optimal and way too much micro for an AE situation.<br>

</div>Rotations will generally only show rune-usage. Fit RP dumps into any spare GCD's you have.<br>
<br>
Example of a frost rotation:<br>
<br>
PS -&gt; IT -&gt; BS -&gt; BS -&gt; OB -- have two GCD's here to dump runic power<br>
PS -&gt; IT -&gt; OB -&gt; One RP dump here -&gt; OB -&gt; Two RP dumps.<br>
<br>
Also, for a Frost build, be sure to use your Rime procs (Freezing Fog buff) during your RP dump GCD's.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Okay, with Glacier Rot that makes sense then.  I'm not sure I would count on 100% uptime of other player's debuffs... it may still make sense to lead with Plague Strike.<br>
<br>
To me, the ranged pulling ability of leading off with Icy Touch overcomes the loss of 10% damage when soloing.  I rarely get to dump my FS after a PS&gt;IT&gt;BS&gt;BS rotation so far.<br>
<br>
I wonder if the 5 expertise is worth more in the initial cycle than the 10% increase on Icy Touch during raids.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">For these reasons alone I'd say Unholy probably wins out. I know that all the fastest levelers swear by any runspeed talents in the game for the fastest leveling, and also, a shortened Death Grip speeds up actual questing quite a bit.<br>

	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>I also am going frost, and while the playstyle differs, I've found it to power through Outland just as well as the specs people swear by.  One of the big advantages I've found is actually as simple as Howling Blast combined with improved Icy Talons while soloing.  I'm definitely looking at the 17/54 spec, however, and will likely change out soon.  Still, you'll be getting some nice haste from the talent, and by using Plague, Icy, Pestilence, HB on groups of mobs, you're able to plow through groups with Howling Blast acting as your AoE and Frost Strike as your RP dump.  Note: this is <i><u><b>NOT</b></u></i> the optimal DPS rotation, just some good mindless leveling spam to combine with Blood Strike, and whatever your build you should study the mentioned DPS compendium.<br>
<br>
Really, only go by what people are swearing by if you're a cookie-cutter kind of person, otherwise choose what you have the most fun with.  Naturally that'll change come raiding/80 and your goals, but for leveling the difference is small.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

It still works that way, 2diseases will heal a lot more than 1, and 3 more than 2, duration left or damage done by the disease don't affect the healing, only the damage you do and the number of disease you have on the mob.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

In terms of leveling, if the stats are somewhat comparable (which in this case, they are) then the advantage goes to the item with the higher DPS. Add in the fact that Helboar Carving Blade ends up with a higher average damage, and it ends up being the better weapon.<br>
<br>
If you have the chance though, try to run through Ramps and pick up a Hellreaver, it's a great weapon to replace the Gsword with.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now for my question... as a blood spec, is DRW worth it as a Runic Power dump? My current rotation is IT-&gt;PS-&gt;HS-&gt;HS-&gt;Death Strike-&gt;Death Coil. After I get a few mobs down I seem to be overrun with RP and I can't Death Coil fast enough to get rid of it. I had heard that DRW isn't worth it. I suppose for solo/questing it's not the best but I can definitly see the advantage for instances and soloing elites.<br>
<br>
How about Bloodworms? They seem to proc fairly often, and give a somewhat respectable amount of damage and healing to me.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Also for fights that last more than 10 seconds (bosses) how does this look for a rotation, considering my spec won't have 3/3 Annihilation until at least 73 or Epidemic until even later.<br>

</div>Or, I could be realizing that while most people who post here want to eke out every last 0.01 DPS at all times, many folks that only read here or post to ask one specific question aren't concerned with minor differences that only have an effect during leveling if you're plowing through mobs non-stop without doing human things like grabbing a snack or drink, using the restroom, taking a phone call, etc.<br>
<br>
As a Mage, I came to realize a long time ago that, for example, while spellpower and haste are both prime stats.  But there comes a point where swapping an item for one extra point of either is only capable of making an actual difference in my speed or efficiency of mob-killing in raid boss situations, if at all.  Example: I'm faced with a choice of items that are identical, except one offers +45 haste and the other offers +40 spellpower.  But I don't choose the haste, because the loss of spellpower equates to needing an extra spell to down a trash mob or leveling white/yellow...so by swapping to the theoretically higher stat, I am using the same, if not more time to kill something for more mana than I started with: a net loss.<br>
<br>
As a Death Knight, the same thing applies to rotations and equipment: if on average I see no difference, or require something like an extra 40 RP or a rune cooldown to kill something because I chose the theoretically higher RAID DPS, I've actually lost out and am having less fun grinding like a machine.<br>
<br>
Hence, the advice: theoretical DPS is purely theory, and in a leveling situation becomes largely subjective since it's possible to have less actual damage on your meter but be using less resources/time to plow through the same 'trash' content.  So, the simple version:<br>
<br>
For leveling, do what's fun for YOU since there's little or no appreciable difference between the competent specs except in dungeon situations, at least through Outland and early Northrend.  Just do your homework here and be ready to change out for the good of high end dungeons and raiding.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Second, I might go try and round up a few blood knights later to check this out, but they were claiming earlier that multiple blood auras stack with each other, as in their strike would heal them of 2%, then 2% again if there was a second blood aura up etc and I was just wondering if someone could confirm this.<br>
<br>
Also I'd go test this myself but bladed armor kind of mucks up the results sometimes.. does blood presence apply to everything or just white strikes? I'd assume the first based on the tooltip but I've heard several people saying that it only applies to white damage.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">The [DEATH STRIKE] tooltip got weird over time, but it used to say give 50% of the damage done+ 50% per disease, or something like that. It still works that way, 2diseases will heal a lot more than 1, and 3 more than 2, duration left or damage done by the disease don't affect the healing, only the damage you do and the number of disease you have on the mob.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>Thanks for the clarification; coupled with some more research it enabled me to come to this conclusion:<br>
<br>
<i>Death Strike - A deadly attack that deals 60% weapon damage plus X and heals the Death Knight for a percent of damage done for each of &lt;his/her&gt; diseases on the target.</i><br>
<br>
"A percentage of damage done for each of my diseases" is in fact referring to the mechanic of counting the active diseases (ex: 2) and then using that as a multiple of the "percentage of damage done" not of the actual diseases but of the Death Strike itself.<br>
<br>
My current understanding of Death Strike is that, in layman's terms, you hit for a certain amount of white dmg when you Death Strike, and that amount is determined like any other AP-based attack (not sure if it's normalized), and the amount of healing done to yourself simultaneously is simple a product of the following 2 factors:  how many active diseases you have on the target, and how much your Death Strike hit them for.<br>
<br>
If you crit, your heal amount is increased accordingly.  If you have 0 diseases active, they still take white dmg but you get no self-healing.<br>
<br>
Now I can finally stop wasting my time trying to maximize Death Strike the wrong way <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100210175249im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":)" class="inlineimg"><br>

</div>I think you've pretty much got it, though Death Strike is in no way white damage. It's clearer when you know how it originally worked.<br>
<br>
The original Death Strike worked like a basic weapon strike-- % of weapon damage, normalized, plus a flat bonus. Then, you got healed for whatever total damage it did, times the number of your diseases on the target. For example, if Death Strike hits for 500, and you have 3 diseases up as Unholy, you got healed for 1500. If DS crits for 1000, you got healed for 3000. If you had no diseases up, you received no heal.<br>
<br>
As you can see, this gets pretty powerful, so DS got nerfed to heal for a % of the total damage done, instead of the total damage done. Otherwise, it works the same way. A portion of DS's damage is multiplied by the number of diseases you have up to determine how much you're healed for.<br>

</div>For solo grinding/leveling, your rotation or RP usage doesn't particularly matter. I usually kill things before I have any opportunity to use RP, so I just refresh Unholy Blight or burn Gargoyle if I want to chain pull mobs. <br>
<br>
For Blood leveling, DRW is a nice dump for burning down elites or group. Otherwise, I wouldn't be too concerned about RP usage. Most of the comments in various threads about the importance of RP are referring to boss fight dps, not questing.<br>
<br>
Bloodworms are really nice for leveling. In raids, they can prove a detriment, and many have argued there are better uses of your points, which I agree with.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">In terms of leveling, if the stats are somewhat comparable (which in this case, they are) then the advantage goes to the item with the higher DPS. Add in the fact that Helboar Carving Blade ends up with a higher average damage, and it ends up being the better weapon.<br>

What I've been using is PS&gt;IT&gt;HS&gt;HS&gt;OB&gt;DC then after that I have 3ish seconds before the unholy/frost runes are off cd for another Obliterate.  Thoughts?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Thanks for the help guys, I was basically on track with the 50/21 build in the compendium so I think I will go with that for now.

I am wondering about a few things.<br>
First of all in unholy, Corpse Explosion seems somewhat situational to me. How effective would that be as opposed say to an additional point in UC?<br>
I also wonder about the effectiveness of Gargoyle vs Dancing Rune Weapon. That point is easily switched and I assume the 51 point talent is better.<br>
In blood, I wonder if it would be better to trade MoB and Abons Might for Bloody Vengeance.<br>
Its all so confusing! I am open for any help or advice you may have. Thanks<br>
Also I am less concerned with raid viability as this is mainly a pvp character....thanks again!</div>

	</tbody></table>
</div>1) Corpse Explosion isn't very good and isn't worth the rune or a talent point imo.<br>
2) Gargoyle is better than DRW.  There are posts in the DPS thread about it.<br>
3) I would drop Blood Aura and Blood Worms if this is a PvP spec. They are very underwhelming for PvP.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_978228"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Corpse Explosion - note that Corpse Explosion on your summoned Ghoul, and that you can summon a Ghoul even in a corpse-less situation via Corpse Dust, making it a non-zero DPS talent even in a single-target raid boss environment.<br>
<br>
Gargoyle vs. Dancing Rune Weapon - as was noted in the Compendium, this is currently a wash. DRW has the advantage of being fire-and-forget, while the Gargoyle requires constant Runic Power production to get the full 1 minute duration. Apparently, the Gargoyle does better base damage, while DRW scales well with weapon upgrades, although it is unclear whether a point of inflection will be reached at any gear level.<br>
<br>
Until we know more, if you want guaranteed damage, I would recommend DRW. Go with the Gargoyle once you're confident you can put out enough RP to maintain it.<br>
<br>
Bloody Vengeance - this is a straight-up 9% DPS increase and is almost certainly superior to Might of Mograine and Abomination's Might's 2% STR increase. I do recommend finding room in your spec to get all three, though.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Actually, the caster tank notion went out the window quite a while back. Our tanking set and most off-set items we'd go for do have the traditional stats: defense, stam, dodge, parry, and then assorted str, expertise, etc for threat. The DK is really an avoidance-type tank. <br>
<br>
@Porta: The opposite is true, sort of. Dual-wielding will increase the number of attacks you make on the boss compared to a two-hander, so you have more opportunities to <i>be parried</i>, which resets the boss' swing timer.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

if money is no problem, i'd suggest inscription and JC. inscription can make it's own shoulder enchants (have also herd rumors of head ones but no proof as of yet), also eliminating your need to grind aldor/scryer rep. JC get lovely gems called "prismatic gems", they match any color slot, are limited to 3 equipped at any one time, but give much higher stats then the wotlk epic boe ones, making it not only easier to meet socket bonuses, but providing a much higher overall stat boost. some good examples are:<br>
<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100429000139/http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=61119" target="_blank">tank shoulder enchant</a><br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100429000139/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=44063" target="_blank">trinket</a><br>

<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100429000139/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=36767" target="_blank">tanking gem 2</a><br>
<br>
those are ones i had bookmarked, but comparable items can be assumed for dps, believe the shoulder dps is 41 ap and 15 crit, and i've seen a 40ish ap gem, as well as a 27 str gem.<br>
<br>
<br>
a question i had, any thoughts on this<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100429000139/http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=jZhxetcczoMRAost0g0hxM" target="_blank">build</a> for tanking? was assuming the extra damage from necrosis and BCB would be a nice extra boost of threat, without taking any of your runes or RP.<br>
<br>
also, has anyone done any number crunching on the duel wield itemization? do we want fast offhand and slow mainhand, or two slow weapons, maybe even two fast weapons?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>There is no reason at all for a Death Knight to use fast weapons. None. The "smoothing" logic that was true to some extent for Fury warriors does not apply; runic power is driven by burning abilities and talents, not hitting the mob. On top of this, a death knight puts a warrior to shame in terms of the number of "weapon damage" attacks they drop. Using fast weapons only reduces the damage of these; none of them function like Bloodthirst.<br>
<br>
Rune Strike functions somewhat like a Heroic Strike, but it has such a huge weapon damage multiplier that I can't see any argument at all for trading down weapon damage for a slightly faster "next melee."<br>
<br>
Fast DK weapons for DPS fall in the same catagory as warriors using DW Mortal Strike (ignoring the Deep Wounds/Sudden Death abuse). There's nothing stopping you from doing it, but it is just flat-out ineffective compared to the alternatives because it isn't what the abilities are designed for.<br>
<br>
DW tanking, on the other hand, is just dumb and dangerous, as well as ineffective. You're not only being sub optimal at this point. You are dramatically increasing the chances you could die, in addition to all the problems of DW'ing against a boss mob without wearing ideal DPS gear.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>More to the point, you have two weapons that the target can parry against (unless you're expertise capped). And you do not want that to happen. <br>
Also, there's no possible way to hit cap your dual wielding white attacks without gimping tanking stats. Basically, you'd be losing threat every time you miss. Short story is, Dual Wield tanking is not a good idea.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">There is no reason at all for a Death Knight to use fast weapons. None. The "smoothing" logic that was true to some extent for Fury warriors does not apply; runic power is driven by burning abilities and talents, not hitting the mob. On top of this, a death knight puts a warrior to shame in terms of the number of "weapon damage" attacks they drop. Using fast weapons only reduces the damage of these; none of them function like Bloodthirst.<br>
<br>
Rune Strike functions somewhat like a Heroic Strike, but it has such a huge weapon damage multiplier that I can't see any argument at all for trading down weapon damage for a slightly faster "next melee."<br>
<br>
Fast DK weapons for DPS fall in the same catagory as warriors using DW Mortal Strike (ignoring the Deep Wounds/Sudden Death abuse). There's nothing stopping you from doing it, but it is just flat-out ineffective compared to the alternatives because it isn't what the abilities are designed for.</div>

	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>Do some research next time. BCB procs the mainhand weapon off of the offhand weapon (like rogue sword spec), and Killing Machine also benefits from a faster offhand. Slow/Fast is definitely the best combination for dual-wielding.<br>
<br>
I'm also pretty confident that the strikes are using normalized attack power - though slower ones do better strike damage, it's not a huge difference.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_978509" style="min-height: 183px;"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->What is the optimal Unholy AoE rotation as far as both solo grinding and instancing (non-tanking) are concerned? I'm well aware of the single target rotation, but I was curious as to what I should be doing in AoE situations, especially considering CC is pretty much nonexistent in 5mans these days.<br>
<br>
Right now soloing after gathering up mobs I'm doing:<br>
DND &gt; IT &gt; PS &gt; Pest &gt; UB if I have the RP, else wait on runes &gt; BB &gt; DS if I need healing, else CE if there is a body and I know it will kill something to activate the glyph. I realize CE kind of sucks, but I love the skill. Also occasionally I'll CE my pet during this AoEing if I'm killing humanoids, and since I'm "experimenting" I picked up Night of the Dead anyways so my Raise Dead is almost always off cooldown anyways.<br>
<br>
Occasionally I toss in Icebound Fort after Pestilence if I feel I'm taking too much damage; I generally don't bother refreshing Bone Shield since it'll die so fast (unless Bone Shield has a "cooldown" between losing charges that I'm unaware of, much like Lighting Shield/etc, still giving you the -40% damage in the meantime).<br>
<br>
As far as instancing I assume it'll be the normal rotation except with Pestilence and BB instead of two Blood Strikes; this would cause you to only get one Death Rune though. Also it's obvious that DND is much better DPS than BB, but it's high threat, however doing either Pestilence or DND removes the option of doing Scourge Strikes.<br>
<br>
I guess I'm just wondering if there is a point where BB AoE will outweigh single target BS, or a magical number of mobs I need to make DND worth more than all the Scourge Strikes I'll miss out on, and whether using DND is a bad idea because of threat.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
For raiding/intancing, I believe the math in the other thread showed that Blood Boil overtakes Blood Strike starting at 2targets with outbreak(might have been 3 but I'm pretty sure it was the lowest possible), and D&amp;D is always better than anything else if there's more than one target too.

</div>This has never been true for instant attacks. "Weapon damage" attacks still uses the damage range of your weapon (base weapon damage) even after weapon speed normalization. At a given DPS, there is every reason to use the slowest brick you can find for something that says "weapon damage +X" or "% of weapon damage". <br>
<br>
The formula is, and has always been since 1.8:<br>
<br>
normalized_damage = base_weapon_damage + (X * Attack Power / 14) <br>
<br>
This is even more important for a death knight than a MS warrior, as the death knight uses far more instant attacks than any MS warrior could dream of absent Unrelenting Assault against something he's tanking with his face. They also have a weapon-damage dependent "Heroic OverRevenge" as Blizzard called Rune Strike. <br>
<br>
I don't know what you're expecting in terms of "huge difference." At comporable DPS and sanely designed weapons, it's not going to be immediately apparent to the naked eye. That doesn't mean leaking damage on every one of your instant attacks isn't suboptimal or doesn't add up.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_978639"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->What experiences are you guys having with AoE tanking in instances?  I ran UK and the Nexus last night, and I tried different things in response to my group pulling (it's worth mentioning that my group had T5-T6 geared DPS).  Granted, this wasn't a big deal, and we only ever had a couple aggro deaths, but there's always room for improvement.  Also, I'm specced for leveling, and I may gain some utility once I hit 80 and respec.<br>
<br>
Rotation 1:<br>
PS-IT-Pest-BB-SS<br>
SS-BB-BB-SS<br>
<br>
This one worked reasonably well, but the first mob often dies before the second half of the rotation where I'll get a good threat lead.  I would lose the second target shortly after the first target died about 30-40% of the time.  I can DC to get him back though.<br>
<br>
Rotation 2:<br>
Pull with DG (usually a caster)<br>
DND-PS-IT-Pest<br>
BB-SS-SS-BB<br>
<br>
I had much better luck with this one.  Given the rate at which they die, I tended to hold them much better.<br>

Anyone using something different or see room for improvement?  I realize that 5-mans are hardly difficult, but I haven't tanked since 60 (on a warrior), so I'm trying to build good tanking habits.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>You're misinterpreting me. I agree that that's how the strikes work. I said that it wouldn't be a huge difference because using a higher weapon dps is generally more important than using a slower weapon for a trispec DW. Of course the weapon speed makes a difference, and I can't actually quantify it without knowing every stat for the player in question, but going up a tier of weapon is worth more than keeping a slow one in your hand. I make this point because it is not the case for Enhancement shamans, who prefer a slow *green* weapon to a fast t5 epic.<br>
<br>
In a nutshell, weapon speed affects our damage, but not our scaling.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I agree.  I would add that this combination is also the most versatile.  Moreso than the other trade skills, this combination allows you to mix/max at a granular level (per socket) over time.  The others (e.g. LW-stam, Mining-HP) are nice bonuses, but you can't swap them for different stats if those are the best weighted stats for you in a particular snapshot of gear.<br>
<br>
Personally, I went with Mining/BS to get the versatility of extra sockets while retaining a gathering skill.

</div>A pleasantly surprising amount.

</div>I think the reason that you don't see any guidelines on dodge/parry (obviously, uncrittable is the first gear goal) is that the math of avoidance just got far more difficult/interesting.  In the past, you could have reasonable assurance when choosing between two items by using stat weights for your general level of gear.  However, the way that DR works means that deciding optimally between two items means calculating the marginal effect of DR with all of your other gear on.<br>
<br>
Practically, this means that most of us will be using Rawr (once a DK Tank module is available) or a spreadsheet to model gear choices, because rules of thumb will be much harder to rely on going forward.  It would be tough to look at the items on your character sheet and in your bag to optimize the best combination without a tool that makes accurate DR calculations based on all your available gear.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>yes, and no. it is still in the game, but i was using it as a generalized rep as i didn't know what the wotlk shoulder enchant rep is. so will you be doomed to grind aldor/scryer rep to get shoulder enchants, no. however you will be grinding rep for SOMEONE to get the wotlk ones. <br>
<br>
also i do believe the highest dps one in woltk will be 40ap 15 crit, an only marginal upgrade from the exalted aldor ones.<br>

@Asari<br>
<br>
that talent is almost a requirement in my opinion, it's 3% less chance to be hit, so would be nearly the same to 3% more dodge OR 3% more parry.<br>
<br>
@Cayal<br>
<br>
from what i've noticed, it resets the timer when you apply, though hard to say for certain i'm almost positive that it's "replaces" the existing disease, not "extends" it. the scourge strike glyph is useful for solo, but as for raiding i'm not to sure of just how useful it is. it's not 100%, and even with the current "Best" rotation it's not a guaranteed proc. at best it's a nice saver for a lucky proc after boss movement, at worst it's a good way to screw up rotations if you try to use it's procs to keep uptime on the diseases.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Personally, I went with 4% parry until I hit 70 and got fallen crusader. For most kill quests I'd mount up, gather a bunch of mobs and AOE them down. The parry seemed to help quite a bit, as did mixing in a healthy amount of tanking gear. (Speaking of, IIRC the quest rewards from the first Nexus and AN quests have some pretty hot tanking pieces. DPS gear is a dime a dozen, I'd suggest picking up the tanking stuff.)<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">What experiences are you guys having with AoE tanking in instances?  I ran UK and the Nexus last night, and I tried different things in response to my group pulling (it's worth mentioning that my group had T5-T6 geared DPS).  Granted, this wasn't a big deal, and we only ever had a couple aggro deaths, but there's always room for improvement.  Also, I'm specced for leveling, and I may gain some utility once I hit 80 and respec.<br>
<br>
Rotation 1:<br>
PS-IT-Pest-BB-SS<br>
SS-BB-BB-SS<br>
<br>
This one worked reasonably well, but the first mob often dies before the second half of the rotation where I'll get a good threat lead.  I would lose the second target shortly after the first target died about 30-40% of the time.  I can DC to get him back though.<br>
<br>
Rotation 2:<br>
Pull with DG (usually a caster)<br>
DND-PS-IT-Pest<br>
BB-SS-SS-BB<br>
<br>
I had much better luck with this one.  Given the rate at which they die, I tended to hold them much better.<br>
<br>
Anyone using something different or see room for improvement?  I realize that 5-mans are hardly difficult, but I haven't tanked since 60 (on a warrior), so I'm trying to build good tanking habits.</div>

	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>After tanking a bunch of the entry level instances (UK, Nexus, first two at AN, generally with a bunch of T6+ geared AOEers with an itchy trigger finger), I found that dropping a DND right before the pull and using DG to initiate the pull seemed to work the best. I'd then toss PS and IT on the mob I wanted to die first and Pestilence it to the rest when they all arrived in the DnD. After that I get up UB as soon as possible to secure AOE threat. (I highly suggest not having RS macroed into other abilities for AOE tanking. It sucks to miss a UB because you just ate 20 rage on an unexpected RS. Use it manually.) I've also found that using BB is generally not a good idea. Better to save the rune for getting another DnD up asap and using your 2nd blood rune for Pest juggling. (This being said, make sure you burn your blood runes in a timely manner or you'll get crushed without having your parry bonus up.) Also, I tend to use DS a lot over SS in AOE situations (for the boosted AE healing threat). I'd expect this may change once I'm in some better gear. All in all I've been fairly impressed with the DK's taking abilities. In a few instances I was able to hold aggro and take reasonable damage on boss mobs 4-5 levels higher than me. (Thank god for Rune Strike.)<br>
<br>
Also, remember we don't have challenging shout to fall back on. Start your AOE threat generation quickly and make that your focus. Better to have one mob smack an aggressive rogue and taunt it back rather than all but one mob beeline for the hunters/locks/mages/etc.<br>
<br>
Speaking of, does anyone know if CEing your ghoul gives you the threat, or the now dead ghoul? 1 pt for what could effectively be a 1.5s cast AOE ohshitIlostaggro button may not be a bad trade.<br>
<br>
On another note, anyone else annoyed with how worthless bone shield is for AOE pulls? Don't get me wrong, its absurdly OP for single target boss encounters, but even with 5 charges its down 1 second into an AOE pull. I guess it is making the initial burst damage from an AOE pack more manageable. Maybe I'm just bitching for the sake of bitching.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Yes, however for dps you still want to use Blood Aura (Unholy is best for PvP).<br>

Yes, Howling Blast is a spell (so is affected by spell miss rate) so gets the bonus.  <br>

		<div id="post_message_979209"><!-- google_ad_section_start --><b>Enthralled</b>: In terms of a DK main-tanking, what we do know for sure at this point is that they are <i>supposed</i> to be able to. They have all the tools to do so:<br>
<br>
* Taunts (albeit lacking a multi-target taunt, <br>
* Increased threat, reduced damage stance<br>
* Several mitigation talents<br>
* Itemization support (defense rating, parry rating, dodge rating, etc.)<br>
* Panic buttons (Icebound Fortitude, Unbreakable Armor, etc.)<br>
<br>
In practice, DKs have only started hitting 80 as of yesterday, so it'll be a while before we see widespread DK MTs, but DK tanking has been tested as viable during the beta test, although I'm not up to speed on how well they mathematically measure up to Warriors/Paladins/Druids.<br>
<br>
<b>Theldon</b>: There are two factions in the Sholazar Basin, the Frenzyheart Tribe and the Oracles, who are opposed to each other like the Aldors and the Scryers. As in TBC, you can only choose one of them to gain rep with, but the choice is not nearly as important as Aldor vs. Scryers, because the shoulder enchants are located in a different faction.<br>
<br>
Apart from the rep rewards, all of which are eventually replaceable, the only thing you'll miss out from either faction will be two Jewelcrafting recipes.<br>
<br>
<b>Asari</b>: Significant tanking changes:<br>
<br>
* Crushing blows will only be caused by mobs that are +4 levels or higher than you. This means that they will not realistically occur in a raid situation, since the most you'll be facing is a +3 mob.<br>
<br>
* Blessing of Salvation has been removed, but tanks have received a 43% threat increase on top of their baseline threat increases to make up for the loss. For a Death Knight, this means that 1 point of damage is worth (1.43 * 1.45) or 2.07 points of threat, or layman's terms, that you'll always be running with Blessing of Salv on your entire group ON TOP OF Frost Presence's 45% threat increase. For the most part, Warriors/Paladins/Druids have been using this really high threat situation to gear exclusively for mitigation.<br>
<br>
* Avoidance has been put on diminishing returns. This means that the first 100 points of dodge rating (and other avoidance stats) offers more dodge percentage than the next 100 points, and so on. In practice, you don't really have to do any number crunching for this, since this new avoidance model is similar to the armor model in that the Time-To-Live remains constant. For more details, refer to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100507221101/http://elitistjerks.com/f31/t29453-combat_ratings_level_80_a/" target="_blank">http://elitistjerks.com/f31/t29453-c...gs_level_80_a/</a><br>
<br>
<b>SpaceDrake</b>: As was noted in the DPS Compendium, Blood would need 123 expertise rating, while Frost/Unholy would need 173 rating to hit the Dodge cap, assuming you took all the relevant expertise talents in your tree.<br>
<br>
As for parry, we won't know for sure until more people move into the raiding scene and we start getting some combat logs. Keep in mind that parry rates would sometimes vary across different bosses in TBC, though.<br>
<br>
<b>dalavita</b>: All of our abilities that use spell damage use (AGI + critical strike rating) to determine crit chance, <b>with the exception of Icy Touch, Howling Blast and Death Coil, which still uses (INT + critical strike rating)</b>. That being said, with the merging of critical strike rating to provide for both melee and spell crits, we're only missing the crit from AGI, which won't be a lot given that Death Knight DPS gear typically has no AGI.<br>
<br>
A level 80 Death Knight has 109 base AGI for 1.74% melee crit, while also having 32 base INT for 0.19% spell crit.<br>
<br>
Assuming you never get any additional AGI on your gear, Icy Touch, Howling Blast and Death Coil should lag behind your other abilities by 1.55% crit.<br>
<br>
<b>richard</b>: Death and Decay and Unholy Blight are DOTs, whose tick timers are NOT affected by haste.<br>
<br>
<b>faight</b>: <br>
<br>
* Yes, Icy Talons will stack with Unholy Presence. <br>
<br>
* Yes, Impurity will increase the AP coefficient of Howling Blast from 10% to 12.5%<br>
<br>
* While I have not tested with Death and Decay specifically, my experience with Consecration is that damage is computed on a per-tick basis, such that my Consecration would experience a 13% gain from Curse of the Elements/Earth and Moon (and by extension I assume Ebon Plaguebringer) even if the effect was applied halfway through the duration.<br>
<br>
* Bone Shield can only lose a charge once every 3.5 seconds, similar to a Shaman's elemental Shields. Assuming you're getting hit every 3.5 seconds, that means that Bone Shield will be up for 17.5 seconds with the Glyph. Since Bone Shield has a 60 second cooldown, it should theoretically have a 30% uptime in this worst-case scenario, making the 40% damage reduction equal to a 12% damage reduction on the average.<br>
<br>
Without the Glyph, Bone Shield would have a 23% uptime for a 9.3% damage reduction.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I'll have to test out DG with mounted people to see if I can get some hilarious results. Unfortunately I'm only 65 and I can't use a flying mount yet, but I'd love to try it out to see.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">faight: Regarding your Ghoul/Corpse Explosion problem, it may be related to the fact that the Ghoul is considered a 'Guardian', and only becomes a 'Pet' if you have the Master of Ghouls talent. I'll try to play around with this later.</div>

</div>I had Master of Ghouls, just so you're aware. Maybe this only occurs with DK's with Shadow of Death though as that's the only person I've dueled against and used CE to kill them. I haven't gotten a chance to play with it yet as I was focused on leveling, and it was kind of back-burner in my head until now for some reason.<br>
<br>
Edit: Oh you were referring to macro targetting. [target=pet] works for Death Coil though, but always returns "Target is Alive" for CE. Obviously it's casting it on them, but I think it's a different skill all together. When you CE your ghoul he actually casts it, much like when you use Explode when you're a ghoul. Perhaps that's why you can't macro the spell, you're telling it to cast it instead of casting it on them, however I'm pretty sure it still costs you an unholy rune. Also CE doesn't show up in your pet's skills in the spellbook.<br>
<br>
Quite odd, really.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Everywhere I see this posted people are saying it will use Mind Freeze if the cooldown is up, and Strangulate if not, including the big DPS compendium thread here. I've been testing it out, and if the cooldown is up for both (and I have the resources for both obviously), this macro will always cast both at the same time.

Personally, this isn't something I'd do, as there are very definitely times I want direct access to Strangulate separately from Mind Freeze.

		<div id="post_message_979294"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Hey guys,<br>
<br>
I've been working on a DW build, similar to the tri-spec talked about at the beginning of the thread.<br>
<br>
My current level 80 spec is as follows: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100507221101/http://www.wow-europe.com/en/info/basics/talents/deathknight/talents.html?tal=0000000000000000000000000003200535033502112301005000350230200305003100000000000000000" target="_blank">World of Warcraft Europe -&gt; Info -&gt; Classes -&gt; Death Knight -&gt; Talents</a><br>
<br>
The basis of this is large howling blasts / ITs, along with BCB, and Killing machine. Slow MH fast OH of course.<br>
<br>
I was wondering what would give more of a DPS boost, with the 5 points in tundra stalker, as I have there, or 5 points in to move those 5 points into the unholy tree, giving 4/5 Impurity (20% more bonus to spells from attack power).<br>
<br>
Obviously I have either a 10% buff in all abilities + 5 Expertise, or the impurity. I find it hard to pick, seeing as i'll be using spells as the majority of my damage.<br>
<br>
Thank you<br>
<br>
Edit: for clarification, this would also be with unholy stance for +15% melee attack speed, with icy talons etc.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I'd go with something like this:<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100507221101/http://www.wow-europe.com/en/info/basics/talents/deathknight/talents.html?tal=2305000000000000000000000003200535030502012301005000300230200305003000000000000000000" target="_blank">World of Warcraft Europe -&gt; Info -&gt; Classes -&gt; Death Knight -&gt; Talents</a><br>
<br>
Dual wield focuses on dealing lots of white damage, if you definitely want Guile of Gorefiend that is. With Bladed Armor 10k armor = 300 or so AP, which seems like a bigger boost to DPS than 10% on abilities since that AP affects everything, and that 10% only affects your abilities. This also would seem like a bigger bonus to your spell's damage than Impurity as well.<br>
<br>
Also I never saw the point the extra RP, and I still don't understand why dual wield builds with Killing Machine get Deathchill. 50% chance to ensure a HB crit versus using a cooldown to get it, when you'll more than likely crit multiple times before you HB anyways? Maybe I'm missing something here.<br>
<br>
And I'd probably go with Blood Presence, because it's 15% more damage on everything. If your aim here is big HB's and IT's and having your weapons hit for as much as they can this seems like a better decision than Unholy Presence.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

At high lvl of avoidance, glyphed bone shield is insane for single target tanking, but not very good for AE tanking, I think that's the point on which it's balanced, and making it 3.5secs would have made it too good for AEing.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Is that if you're taking hits for a full minute or not? When grinding I generally have Bone Shield up, run in and grab mobs, AoE, loot, and the shield is back up before I'm ready to move on to the next 5-10 mobs. At 2 seconds a bone that means I'll have 6 seconds of reduction initially if I'm getting hit nonstop, as there is no cooldown on the first bone disappearing, and no benefit after the last one, unless I misunderstood.<br>
<br>
As for the Mind Freeze, doing /cast Mind Freeze; Strangulate does not work. I've settled for /cast [target=mouseover, harm] Strangulate; Mind Freeze. Mouseover baddies for Strangulate, if you're mousing over a fellow player/yourself/nothing it'll Mind Freeze your current target. This works pretty good in the half hour I got to test it before the server went down.<br>
<br>
Also, another question that popped in my head: Why is it that in all the Frost DPS specs you're told to hold off on your HB if Rime procs? In straight up frost in the DPS Compendium it says to not use Rime procs until the end of your first rotation when you burn RP with FS. In Trispec where you're going to use HB anyways wouldn't it make more sense to toss it out immediately after IT regardless, that way if it's free you're good to go for OB, and if it's not then oh well, you've already used it, and it might possibly be back off of cooldown by the time you get to the "OB" section anyways, and considering melee crits have a 50% chance to make your HB always crit wouldn't 100% crit chance HB &gt; OB?<br>

</div>You hold off your rime procs until the runes are used, otherwise you'll push back the cooldown of at least a couple runes by 2 seconds. Do this a few times and it adds up. If you do it during your RP-dump period, you don't change anything with your rotation.<br>
<br>
<br>
*E @ Bologne: 15% more Killing Spree procs is somewhat moot - it's uptime is already incredibly high. As far as 15% more BCB procs, you may get more, but each one is doing less damage. Unholy Presence is not a PVE-DPS presence.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
Dual wield focuses on dealing lots of white damage, if you definitely want Guile of Gorefiend that is. With Bladed Armor 10k armor = 300 or so AP, which seems like a bigger boost to DPS than 10% on abilities since that AP affects everything, and that 10% only affects your abilities. This also would seem like a bigger bonus to your spell's damage than Impurity as well.<br>
<br>
Also I never saw the point the extra RP, and I still don't understand why dual wield builds with Killing Machine get Deathchill. 50% chance to ensure a HB crit versus using a cooldown to get it, when you'll more than likely crit multiple times before you HB anyways? Maybe I'm missing something here.<br>
<br>
And I'd probably go with Blood Presence, because it's 15% more damage on everything. If your aim here is big HB's and IT's and having your weapons hit for as much as they can this seems like a better decision than Unholy Presence.</div>

</div>From my math, Impurity adds more at 5/5 than bladed armor. Due to the spec being so based on spells (tons of IT, HB, 2 diseases) you get a pretty rediculous bonus to them. And it scales a ton more, as its benefit is extremely high from ATP, which you will be gaining a ton more than armor.<br>
<br>
As far as the blood vs unholy presence, when I tested a DW spec much like this one (I chose to go further into unholy for impurity and Desecration/Bone armor) and I actually did more dps in unholy. The 15% haste vs 15% damage is a strong point, but everyone ignores the huge GCD redction in unholy. Maybe once you get the hit to never miss blood will shine, but even when I tested on lower levels the GCD increased my dps a ton. Then again, I chose to use my death runes for IT, due to its fairly high damage with this build, so I had a ton more skills in a short time. I called the build a spammy build as it used a ton of smaller abilities.<br>
<br>
I also would use Howling blast regardless and if it was a Rimed HB, I would cast IT and PS again. as with DW those two far out damaged an Oblit, and might give me another rime to do the same with again.<br>

I know its odd, but I had pretty good numbers from my testing compared to other more orthodox builds. I understand the issues with desecration, but this build would be using Plague Strike more than most, so I feel I could keep it active fairly well.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_979470"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I think some discussion of 2H weapon speed would be useful in the DPS compendium, although it is currently locked (to me anyway).  Since DK strikes as 'spammable' attacks benefit more from slower weapons, it would nice to codify the DPS gains from using slower 2H weapons.  To that end, I crafted a spreadsheet.<br>
<br>
Purely for example, I used the following specifications:<br>
<br>
o 2H weapons with the same dps, but varying speeds<br>
o 2000 attack power  (14 AP = 1 dps)<br>
o Damage per hit = (weapon DPS + AP DPS) * weapon speed<br>
o A Blood Spec rotation of PS - IT - HS - HS - OB - DC / PS - IT - HS - HS - HS - HS (so that's 9 strikes in 20 seconds)<br>
<br>
Notes:  PS does 30% weapon dmg (plus modifiers), HS does 60% weapon dmg (plus modifiers), and OB does 100% weapon dmg (plus modifiers).<br>
<br>
Let's assume that all of the other stats on the weapons are equal in terms of EP.  Ignoring the strike modifiers, we would gain 30% of a slower weapon's increased damage per hit on PS, 60% on HS, and 100% on OB.  That means the total damage increase per rotation (TDIpR) column = 2*PS(30% increase) + 6*HS(60% increase) + OB(100% increase)<br>
<br>

150		3.2	937.14	
150		3.3	966.43		29.29		152.29	7.61
150		3.6	1054.29		117.14		609.14	30.46
170		3.2	1001.14
170		3.3	1032.43		31.29		162.69	8.13
190		3.2	1065.14	
190		3.3	1098.43		33.29		173.1	8.65</pre>
</div>So given 2000 AP, a gain of 0.1 weapon speed will produce a modest but significant gain in DPS of about 8.  The difference between a 3.2 and 3.6 speed weapon, therefore, is typically upwards of 30 DPS.  Also, because the speed of the weapon is multiplied by its damage plus attack power, the more attack power you have, the bigger DPS gain you will see from a slower weapon. If I used 4000 AP in the calculation, the DPS gain on a 190 DPS 2H weapon going from 3.2 to 3.6 speed would be about 50 DPS, as compared to a 35 DPS gain at 2000 AP.<br>
<br>
It becomes more interesting when we start to compare weapons that have different DPS and different speeds.  Let's just take one really simple example (using 2000 AP again):<br>
<br>
<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px">
	<div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom:0px"><img src="/web/20100508074757im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/chestnut/misc/code_html.gif" border="0"></div>
	<pre class="alt2" dir="ltr" style="
		margin: 0px;
		padding: 3px;
		border: 1px inset;
		width: 694px;
		height: 66px;
		text-align: left;
		overflow: auto">Base DPS	Spd	Dmg/Hit		Increase	TDIpR	DPS gain
130		3.2	873.14
120		3.6	946.29		73.14		380.34	19.01</pre>
</div>So after subtracting out the 10 DPS difference (19.01 DPS gain - 10 DPS difference), the lower DPS but slower weapon (120 DPS / 3.6 speed) actually provides a 9 DPS gain.<br>
<br>
Of course all of these calculations assume that the EP weights of the stats on the weapons being compared are the same.  If they are not, your mileage may vary.<br>
<br>

Otherwise you're stuck with 50 RP (55 with dirge), which is unsatisfying. 10% less icy touch damage is definitely a trade-off, but more UB uptime is a clear benefit.

Can I Death Grip people off of their mounts in midair while I myself am flying and then use a slowfall effect of some sort to not die myself, alternatively can I death grip people from the ground in to the air and cause them to die that way (perhaps they're standing on a cliff and I'm hovering over the gorge below).<br>

</div>Quick answer is no. <br>
<br>
If you're on a flying mount and you cast death grip it will dismount you, but the spell does not go off because you are immediately falling and the spell can't be cast while moving. Same goes for while in air and attempting to death grip people on the ground. Finally if a player is on a mount and you death grip them it does not pull them off their mount. <br>
<br>
In beta, I played on the PVP server and the zone in to Naxx ( if you have seen it) could be considered a choke point for a faction to get easy kills for those trying to get into the raid zone since you have to fly up to it. I tried on several failed occasions to death grip a horde off the Naxx platform into mid air and join me in the inevitable fall to my death. The ONLY success I had was to land on one of the bones sticking out of the bottom of Naxx, and Death grip a player to me and have a Druid Typhoon them off said bone.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Right, it is still 2s on live, I think they backed off changing it, and added a glyph instead.

Those two points in necrosis might be better off elsewhere like unholy command.<br>
<br>
I really like having 5/5 desecration which is what my leveling build has, but I'm not sure how to fit it in.  I know it's less dps per point than necrosis, but it's got some utility with the slow and I don't want to use the scourge strike glyph. <br>
<br>
Maybe by dropping Unholy aura and Rune Tap I can go 3/5 necrosis and 5/5 desecration.  Am I really hurting a party/raid by dropping UA?<br>
<br>
I guess my question is which to choose between 3/5 Nec, 5/5 Des, or 5/5 Nec, 2/2 UA, and RT.  I like the survivability RT represents, but I'm not sure whether I'll have a blood rune when I need it.  In dire situations I'm usually looking for my unholy rune cooldown anyway so I guess it will make it more likely that a heal will be coming sooner rather than later.<br>
<br>
Another question... Should I be using Death and Decay at all during AOE rotations?  I can't seem to find space for it.  It's normally IT &gt; SS &gt; Pestilence &gt; Blood Boil &gt; Death strike &gt; then BB and DS as cooldowns refresh and RP dumps.  D&amp;D is much better damage than Blood Boil but the runic cost is prohibitive.  Anyone know how to get effective use out of it when AOEing?<br>
<br>
Finally, should I be Rune Striking when it procs (once UB is up and going) or stick to Death Coil?  It procs a lot and I'm wondering if it's comparable with DC once morbidity and Impurity are considered.

</div>Runestrike is amazing.. But that looks like a dps build to me. Are we talking soloing? Runestrike procs when *you* dodge or parry, so, you won't be using it much in a raid-dps role. If you do mean to ask about soloing here, use runestrike every time it procs - if your weapon is appropriately slow, it's better than anything else you can cast.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

D&amp;D is much better damage than Blood Boil but the runic cost is prohibitive.  Anyone know how to get effective use out of it when AOEing?<br>
<br>
Finally, should I be Rune Striking when it procs (once UB is up and going) or stick to Death Coil?  It procs a lot and I'm wondering if it's comparable with DC once morbidity and Impurity are considered.  If it is, are those talent points possibly better spent elsewhere?</div>

	</tbody></table>
</div>I would say use Rune Strike when you can. I've had mine crit for upwards of 4k and I'm only level 72. As long as you have the power to keep UB up. <br>
<br>
<br>
I'm not a huge fan of D&amp;D outside of tanking. It does good damage, but the rune cost is too high for me when I'm just leveling. I'd say try it out and see if you end up rune starved, and see if the mobs drop faster for you. One thing I really hate about D&amp;D is when I drop it then someone drags like 4 mobs through it as they run by and I end up getting agro.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>DnD is for AoE. It really costs too much and reduces your ability to put out threat on your main target too much. For just keeping shit off your healers, It/Ps/Pestilence-Bloodboil will generate enough aggro and keep dots ticking on extra mobs in order to keep them off your healers. Frost gets the added benefit of Howling Blast helping out, Unholy gets higher disease ticks + Unholy Blight. Blood sucks for aoe tanking.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_979880" style="min-height: 173px;"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I'm having some trouble filling out the last few points of my 80 spec. I'm planning this around tanking 5-10 mans, as my schedule does not currently mesh with my guild's raid schedule well. I'd like some input and discussion from intelligent people on the relative benefits of several talents.<br>
<br>
Starting from here: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100331203025/http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=j0EZGgxthcbRhR0osx0x" target="_blank">Talent Calculator - World of Warcraft</a><br>
<br>
It's a pretty standard frost tank spec, with the Icy Talons line since lower-size instances aren't as likely to have an enhancement shaman, and if they do, they can probably drop WoA or something of that nature and not run into other buffs that don't stack with those. I did take Icy Reach which I have in my current spec and find invaluable for general pulling and ranged-tanking purposes.<br>
<br>
Talents I'm considering for the last 6 points:<br>
- Subversion: Obliterate crit seems good. On the other hand, I'm often using my FUs on HB.<br>
<br>
- 2H Spec / Dark Conviction: Decent threat filler if I don't find anything else to drop the points on.<br>
<br>
- Rune Tap / 1x Imp Rune Tap: Seems pretty lackluster, but it's another oh crap button.<br>
<br>
- Deathchill: Makes Howling Blast give lots of burst threat, but can't be used consistently on every AoE pull, so doesn't really seem too hot to me. I guess it would be an AoE taunt of sorts, which is something I've often felt I lack.<br>
<br>
- Blood of the North: Good for single target threat / DPS but for general AoE tanking purposes I'd use Pest/BB or Pest/DnD with my blood runes even if they were death runes, so seems quite skippable.<br>
<br>
- Acclimation: Lackluster but it's the only 'mitigation' option which makes it worth considering.<br>
<br>
- Hungering Cold: Good effect for those 'oops someone pulled the entire room' situations, but the steep RP cost and the fact that it's likely to just break from random whirlwinds or people AoEing early make it seem really... not good. It does provide a sort of AoE taunt like effect but much less so than Deathchill/HB.<br>
<br>
- Morbidity: I very rarely DnD except to gather mobs initially; I find Pest + HB to be a better use of runes in general. So the cooldown reduction doesn't seem great. The benefit of this talent is that with 3/3 you get to spam DnD on every cooldown out of combat and gain net RP so you can start fights out with 100. Gimmicky, but could be useful particularly if I take HC.<br>
<br>
- Epidemic: I have this now and I don't like how my diseases fall off if I try to do a second rotation without PS/IT (on single targets). On multi targets I'll be using Pestilence every rotation. So is this really needed at all? I'm definitely leaning towards at least trying a spec without it and seeing how it works out.<br>
<br>
I guess I'm leaning towards Subversion, Deathchill, and dropping the last two on Dark Conviction experimentally, moving them to Epidemic if I feel it is necessary.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
Awesome! And I gather it's still a really viable unholy talent then? I'm still probably taking it over Necrosis (I think Impurity is better).<br>
<br>
For example. Outbreak 3/3 is a 30% bonus, but with 5/5 Impurity it's actually a 37.5% bonus.<br>

		<div id="post_message_980012"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Does anyone know why the DPS Compendium suggests to use UB as a regular part of your damage rotation?  According to the coefficients in that post and my napkin math, below, DC should outperform UB in terms of damage per RP assuming single-target once you pass ~1400 AP.<br>
<br>
If my math is accurate, it seems to me that you should only use UB if you are below 1300 AP, AoEing, or you get some resists or misses and so are both GCD-starved and RP-capped, none of which should be the "typical" rotation in a raid.  <br>

</div>2000 AP is also looking like a sizeable understatement for the AP raiding DK's will have.  Already at 78 I've over 2.5k AP in a "raid buffed" situation (BoM and Enh Shammy)<br>
<br>
As you increase the AP the weapon damage range becomes a smaller component of the strike damage leading to a decreased importance of slow weapons.<br>
<br>
As you say to end though I do agree that with differing stats and EP from the weapons its likely that most of this difference will be lost in the noise.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I was reading the DPS compendium thread and it listed the three colours of gem choice.<br>
My question is: it doesn't say what you should prioritize, while on the hit-section it basically says "GOGO get hitcapped", should I just, like a rogue, gem for full hit until I get the cap and then gradually put in more stre/crit-gems the better gear I get?<br>
And regarding enchants, same there, always expertise/hit-enchants until you're capped?<br>
<br>
And do gem prioritizing change depending on what you plan to spec? I plan to be frost at least until we've killed all bosses in the tier 6 content and then see how blood works out.</div>

		<div id="post_message_981078"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->So, I completely get that Rune Strike is a huge dps ability, but my question is: Is it worth putting it in your macro's in an unholy build for levelling and/or tanking?  I'm not much of a theory crafter (I leave that to you guys and just mooch/leach off of you), but am interested to know...<br>
<br>
In my experience - after taking down a mob or two I have a obscene amount of runic power, so it's probably worth it while level or mat grinding, but I'm worried about dumping too much RP when I'm tanking.<br>

		<div id="post_message_981086"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Unholy Presence seems better than advertised.  Looking at the runic power talents, how best to generate runic power (single rune abilities), and taking advantage of the 1.0 sec GCD, it's possible to do a lot of abilities.<br>
<br>
Keys to this: Icy Touch Glyph, Dirge, Chill to the Grave.  Blood of the North.  Frost Strike.<br>
<br>
With this setup, Plague Strike gives 15 runic power, Icy Touch gives a whopping 25 runic power, and Blood Strike just 10.<br>
<br>
PS -&gt; IT -&gt; FS -&gt; BS -&gt; BS -&gt; PS -&gt; IT -&gt; FS -&gt; FS (if available)<br>
<br>
PS -&gt; IT -&gt; FS -&gt; IT -&gt; IT -&gt; PS -&gt; IT -&gt; FS -&gt; FS<br>
<br>
Note that you can use Rime powered Howling Blast in a Frost Strike spot.  The "if available" Frost Strike becomes available after you've done your first 20 sec rotation.  At some points, you'll have an extra second to fire another Frost Strike to siphon off some of the excess runic power.  Note with 6 Icy Touchs in each 20 sec rotation, you will likely get one Rime proc every rotation which is why you'll have excess runic power.  The free Howling blast will give you 20 runic power.  Note that having a couple points in rune power mastery is very helpful when this happens.  If you are lucky, Rime will proc on the first or second Icy Touch and you'll get a perfect rotation from the start (30% chance).<br>
<br>
This uses 9 abilities per 10 seconds.  This is due to latency.  You can fire a 19th ability in 20 sec if you have good latency and good reflexes.  <br>
<br>
Since it uses a lot of Frost abilities, this type of build benefits greatly from a duel wield Slow/Fast setup.  I recommend 0/49/22.  If your tank can handle the threat, this produces a ton of damage.  Killing Machine is just amazing in this kind of setup.  Look at the number of abilities that can auto-crit in that rotation and you understand how damage goes through the roof with this setup.  Every Frost Strike, Icy Touch, and Howling Blast can auto-crit with Killing Machine.  With 20% haste base (Improved Icy Talons and Unholy presence) and 20% Icy Talons bonus haste, you generate a lot of hits to proc Killing Machine.<br>
<br>
If anyone knows a good simulator, this needs to be tested.  I can't do this in the game as my death knight is not level 80.  My napkin math shows this has some amazing potential.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">So, I completely get that Rune Strike is a huge dps ability, but my question is: Is it worth putting it in your macro's in an unholy build for levelling and/or tanking?  I'm not much of a theory crafter (I leave that to you guys and just mooch/leach off of you), but am interested to know...<br>
<br>
In my experience - after taking down a mob or two I have a obscene amount of runic power, so it's probably worth it while level or mat grinding, but I'm worried about dumping too much RP when I'm tanking.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>I would (and do) macro it to all strikes for leveling, the damage per RP is much better than everything else.  I tanked Nexus the other day with my usual macros, but experienced exactly what you're worried about - sometimes it was fine, but several times I found I was unable to pop UB when I wanted to get AoE aggro, and even worse, unable to pop IF when there was an "oh shit" moment (one of the boss's frenzies, I don't remember which does it).<br>
<br>
What I'm going to do is just add an "alt" modifier to the macros so it will trigger freely when I have plenty of RP and/or am on a boss with IF still on cooldown, but use the alt-macros when there's a need to save RP.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_981200"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Trying to stir up some discussion here. Reading through these threads and looking at the talents from the standpoint of an unholy PvE offtank/DPS role, it seems that there are several unholy talents that are best avoided. Once you understand this, it's much easier to develop an optimized spec as many false choices are eliminated. They are:<br>
<br>
- Corpse explosion: The unholy rune is better used in a scourge/death strike or D&amp;D when AEing. Leaves the DK with an orphan frost rune. Corpse explosion is cool, but useless in its current incarnation.<br>
- Unholy command: This is a PvP-only talent. <br>
- Virulence: Affects only IT, DC, and howling blast (if frost). May be worthwhile for frost specs doing AE. But probably not.<br>
- Outbreak and Necrosis: Way too little benefit from outbreak. Necrosis is debatable, and I would love to see someone defend the talent.<br>
- Morbidity: Moderately useful for AE tanking, otherwise weak as unholy will be using unholy blight rather than DC and doesn't use D&amp;D when DPSing. I usually find myself taking morbidity anyway, as it's the best choice available to reach the next tier.<br>
- On a pale horse: This is a leveling/PvP talent with very minor tanking utility. It's not worth taking after 79, maybe even 77 with a swift flier, for PvE. <br>
- Night of the dead: An obsolete talent from beta, before unholy DKs had real ghoul pets. It has moderate utility for use in boss battles with death pact, but I don't see any DKs taking these points now.<br>
- Desecration: Another debatable one. This talent locks the DK into using plague strike, eliminating the choice of the scourge strike glyph, and offers a 20/40/60/80/100% chance of 5% overall damage in a small static area. I disregard the snare effect. If desecration was a 100% chance of a 1/2/3/4/5% damage increase and the effect moved with my character, this would be a much more attractive talent. Based purely on numbers it's worthwhile; in the actual game I try to skip it.<br>
<br>

</div>At low level of gear, if you miss or get dodged(or parried if tanking), your deathrunes will turn back to their original state. For unholy and frost, that means blood runes go back to blood and can't be used for scourge strike or oblit/howling blast anymore, ruining your rotation even more. Depending on what runes were used and so on, you can sometimes blood tap to get back on track. Happened a few times tonight for me in naxx, so it's not totally worthless I guess. Also remotely useful while soloing, convert blood runes to death between mobs so you can unleash bigger burst. Works for pvp too. Not a very powerful spell, but can be useful nonetheless.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Napkin math ahoy:<br>
<br>
An unglyphed rank 4 Obliterate with 2 diseases active deals 100% weapon damage + 584.<br>
An glyphed rank 4 Obliterate with 2 diseases active deals 120% weapon damage + 438.<br>
<br>
This is a damage difference of 146.<br>
<br>
It's quite difficult to come up with an exact number for when the 20% increased weapon damage is worth more than the 146 extra damage due to the dual interaction with both weapon damage and AP. I could say 3100 AP as a ballpark, but that's disregarding base weapon damage altogether.<br>
<br>
Instead, let's say that <b>"If your Character Sheet lists your average white hit as 730.00 or more, then using the Obliterate Glyph is a net damage increase."</b><br>
<br>
As for the other breakpoints:<br>
<br>
Rank 3: 596.25<br>
Rank 2: 381.25<br>
Rank 1: 310.00<br>
<br>
EDIT: My level 59 Death Knight's average white hit is listed at 428, which means that I can use the Obliterate Glyph as soon as I learn Obliterate (assuming I wasn't Unholy), and I'm still in mostly all starting quest line gear. <br>
<br>
My guildmate's level 76 DK's average white hit is listed at 786.5, which is already past the last rank's 730 breakpoint. I think it's safe to say that anyone DPSing with a two-hander will see a benefit from the Glyph, regardless of gear level. Only dual-wielders and tanks will have to double-check.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Is dual-wielding going to scale well enough to out-class 2 handers at a certain reasonable endgame point? Obviously not around the Naxx level, but I'm just wondering if it's reasonable enough to worry about 2 handers being eclipsed by dual-wield for PvE dps at a certain point. Also not referring to tanking here, because if what I remember is right, dual-wield will never be better for tanking... I think.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div class="intellitxt" id="post_message_981821"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->My friend and I are both leveling DK and we have a question about a few things. <br>
<br>
Both of us are spec Unholy 17/0/54 - DPS<br>
<br>
First I noticed most rotations go like this:<br>
IT -&gt; PS -&gt; BS -&gt; BS -&gt; SS -&gt; UB/DC<br>
<br>
With IT and PS interchangeable, is there a reason why SS isn’t right after PS since it does more damage then BS? Right after we cast IT and PS, we have 1 FR and 1 UR left to cast whether we cast BS before or after. Something tells me there is a talent that makes it worthwhile to cast BS first but I don’t see it. <br>
<br>
Next why do so many people take Unholy Blight (51 Unholy talent)? It is really that good? It seems lackluster after they removed the disease counters it added a few patches ago. I took it to try it out but it doesn’t seem to do a lot of damage. <br>

First : Rotation are PS-&gt; IT  -&gt; BS -&gt; BS -&gt; SS -&gt; UB/DC<br>
Because in an unholy spec, IT damage is increase by Rage of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100809231045/http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=50121" target="_blank">Rivendare Talent.</a><br>
<br>
Second :<br>
Why we use  BS -&gt; BS -&gt; SS in that order ? It's because of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100809231045/http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=56835" target="_blank">Reaping talent </a><br>
That means that in our next rotation, we will use a SS instead of 2 BS and give us a better DPS.<br>
<br>
Third : <br>
Why Unholy Blight ? In AOE situation, it's a lot better than DC. <br>
I don't have the math close to me, but on a Brutallus-like fight, UB have a better DPS/GCD than DC.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Rune Strike only triggers on INCOMING attacks. Luckily, when soloing, DK's strength gives them a hefty amount of parry, so we can proc it a lot that way. It does not proc on outgoing attacks.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic"> Desecration: Another debatable one. This talent locks the DK into using plague strike, eliminating the choice of the scourge strike glyph, and offers a 20/40/60/80/100% chance of 5% overall damage in a small static area. I disregard the snare effect. If desecration was a 100% chance of a 1/2/3/4/5% damage increase and the effect moved with my character, this would be a much more attractive talent. Based purely on numbers it's worthwhile; in the actual game I try to skip it.</div>

</div>Short &amp; vague answer: It depends on your critrate, hitrate, spell pen, and what you use the proc on (need a spreadsheet to figure it out). <br>
<br>
Longer, mildly promising answer: <br>
(Warnings: Napkin math, no resist or miss taken into account)<br>
<br>
IF...<br>
... You have a 3.5 speed weapon<br>
... Your critrate is 10%<br>
... You succeed at using KM on Frost Strike ONLY<br>
... Frost Strike is critting @ 260% (how off is my memory? :-/)<br>
<br>
You will see up to a 41.4% increase in Frost Strike damage. <br>
<br>
A 20% critrate yields a 32% increase and a 30% critrate nets a little above 25%.<br>
<br>
Remember, the key is that you'll only be using an applicable ability so often so while you only crit, say, one in 10 swings, you just bumped another ability's critrate enormously because you use it about 1/3rd as often!<br>
-----<br>
<i>Edit:</i> Ok, so Frost Strike Crits for 245%--that probably lowers the increase a bit but not a horrible amount. Probably 5-7.5% per.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>No, you can't be healed by its DS, nor should it be able to proc bloodworms.  HOWEVER, if you use Raise Dead while Dancing Rune Weapon is active, it will summon a second ghoul that will last for the remainder the DRW's duration.  I haven't levelled high enough to test it, or asked a level 80 player to, but I suspect the same sort of thing can happen with Army of the Dead.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>As with anything tank based, your initial concern should be to become uncrittable through Defence, this will also increase your dodge/parry more than looking at individual ratings.  There is some theorycraft for DK tanking around, a lot is on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100809231041/http://www.deathknight.info/" target="_blank">DeathKnight.info</a> but also check out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100809231041/http://www.tankspot.com/" target="_blank">TankSpot</a><br>

</div>I find it useful to utilise the Death Rune's ability to be used in place of another rune.  Mostly when AE tanking (as frost), I can do D&amp;D, HB, Pestilence, PS, IT, Blood Tap, BB as it brings up death runes, allowing Bloodboil to be used.  But, then again, I do tank for maniacs sometimes. As D&amp;D + HB should be enough to hold most things.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>As far as #1, I can't think of any snare debuffs that bosses are affected by.<br>
<br>
#2, yes, it definitely works for Heart Strike.<br>

The glyph is good for Unholy mainly, with frost as a slight second. Descration will mean anything you're dpsing that isn't snare immune is snared for 60% of the time (and all the time that you are bloodstriking). With frost, depending on whether you take the appropriate talents to apply a snare to Frost Fever, it's useful.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>This also means that at higher levels of avoidance when using two-handed weapons, Rune Strike can effectively replace ALL of your autoattacks, especially if you have Blessing of Sanctuary generating additional runic power for you.<br>

</div>Not that you're incorrect, but might I suggest we test out the assumption that Rune Strike doesn't proc Necrosis.  There is at least one post suggesting otherwise:<br>

<br>
Needless to say, if Rune Strike does count as an autoattack w/r/t Necrosis, Necrosis would jump to the top of any Unholy tank's must-have list.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I'm pretty sure it applies to all attacks, as I think it's effect simply adds 2% fire damage (4% vs undead) onto your weapon's damage range. I.e, if your weapon did exactly 100 every time (damage range 100-100), Lichbane would make your weapon's damage range 100-100 +2fire.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Personally I'd drop Lichborne and Deathchill to pick up Gargoyle. Lichborne doesn't seem like it'll give that much of a boost to DPS other than breaking a fear once every three minutes, and Deathchill is a two minute Killing Machine and considering you're dual wielding Killing Machine should pretty much always be up. Also the only skill you'd be using that Deathchill affects and Killing Machine doesn't is Obliterate, and DW probably shouldn't be Oblit'ing anyways.<br>
<br>
Just my opinion though, I consider the Gargoyle to be an AMAZING DPS boost, as well as a useful RP dump with much better returns than just spamming DC.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_984756" style="min-height: 183px;"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I've been trying out a bit of a odd spec and I'd like to see what the forum's thoughts are on it. Also there's no topic to discuss specs so this is why I'm posting it here<br>
<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100508074432/http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=jZG0xtIxdohoVocZfM0htckx0o" target="_blank">Talent Calculator - World of Warcraft</a><br>
(44/27)<br>
<br>
It's a very heavy spell-based spec, so much so that only about 30% of damage done is melee based, with about 40-45% from howling blast,icy touch, and the diseases(without gog). Corpse explosion is mostly a filler, and I know many talents could be rearranged, but I'm only 73 right now so i can't test it at 80. the rotation I use is as follows: <br>
IT&gt;HB&gt;PS&gt;OB&gt;BS&gt;BS&gt;DC<br>
HB&gt;OB&gt;OB&gt;DC<br>
<br>
The main perks are a perm ghoul, impurity to make all of your spells scale extremely well, and howling blast with gog, as well as being DW centric.<br>
<br>
So, what is the group's thought on this?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_984779"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->You would be better off with a 0/50/21 build instead.  Those five points in Unholy won't generate as much DPS as five points in frost will.  An extra 8% damage to almost your entire rotation and 4 expertise is better than your ghoul getting 3 extra minutes of shelf life.  Not to mention Frost Strike will do more damage than Death Coil even if you use a 2.6 speed weapon in your main hand.<br>
<br>
You are presumably using Blood Presence which means one rotation should have a maximum of 6 abilities (9 sec + latency).  I recommend putting the blood strikes sooner in your rotation as you'll be waiting a while to do that last Obliterate with what you list.  The death runes from the blood strikes are needed for the last Obliterate.  Your rotation also assumes that you proc Rime with your first Icy Touch which is only a 15% chance.  If a person follows your rotation, you can't do the Obliterate in your first rotation because all frost and unholy runes are used by PS+IT+HB.<br>
<br>
Your rotation should look like this:<br>
<br>
PS -&gt; IT -&gt; BS -&gt; BS -&gt; OB -&gt; FS<br>
PS -&gt; IT -&gt; OB -&gt; OB -&gt; FS<br>
<br>
However, if you wish to use Unholy Presence, you are much better off with 0/49/22.  See my earlier post in this thread about why this build excels for maximizing Killing Machine and the 1.0 sec GCD that comes with Unholy Presence.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Given that you manage about 2k dps, with a 300 dps ghoul, that accounts for very close to 10% damage bonus, which outstrips the extra 10% from tundra stalker<br>

</div>Not sure what you mean by Blood lacking Annihilation since 51/13/7 requires it and does quite well. I'm 77 in pure quest items and I already match DPS with players in partial SWP gear.<br>
And while I can't speak from Naxx experience, I definitely have noticed that when I can only apply one of my diseases that it's more efficient to go straight to HS and OB. I feel that glyph of Obliterate was made almost for these situations alone.<br>

I have a question about this same issue that I hope someone can answer. In the past I've always geared for 5.6% as the expertise (dodge) cap, based off defense/weapon skill mechanics article on WoWwiki. But the numbers in the DPS compendium indicate the value is actually 6.5% and while I've heard from some that this is the true value, I've never seen proof.

		<div id="post_message_985052"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->More of a leveling DPS rotation question. <br>
<br>
I am deep frost, minor blood.<br>
<br>
1) I am finding that howling blast is doing better than obliterate currently at lv 64. Yet, the talents in frost seems to favour obliterate more. But the reality is different. My HB just hits harder. I read that obliterate gets better when you get a higher DPS weapon. I am 2 hander. So, how high is the DPS of the weapon needed before obliterate gets better than HB? <br>
<br>
2) I initially had a rotation where I used plague strike faithfully. But nowadays, I am finding that for normal mobs, I kill faster by skipping plague strike most of the time. So the rotation is like this:<br>
<br>
IT -&gt; HB -&gt; FS-&gt; BS -&gt; BS. (plague strike is last if the mob is not dead, and it usually is by this time).<br>
<br>
This rotation seems more than enough to kill most mobs provided I don't miss. And because I start dealing damage from range, I kill faster and take less damage also. So, is skipping plague strike actually ok? Because I am not finding it very useful at this point. Even its DOT up, my blood strikes do maybe 40 to 50 more damage only. So, is it really worth spending the GCD on such a low damage strike just to boost my overal blood strike damage by maybe 100 over the course of killing a mob?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_985101"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->What you have to realize about HB is that it may -hit- harder, however its -crit- chance is significantly lower than Obliterate's, so that Obliterate's average damage is much higher. Looking at the recount data I currently have up, I have 6.4% crit on Howling Blast (including typically using it with Deathchill) and 43.5% on Obliterate. And compared to many other recounts I've looked at, this one is pretty low for Obliterate.<br>
<br>
You're probably right about Plague Strike for frost soloing. I'll try not using it and see if my DPS increases.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Good question, I don't think it does but would be easy to test. Use the elixir and fight one of the training dummies using Death Strike.

</div>Gift of Arthas procs upon a target hitting you, not upon you hitting a target. This also makes the potion pretty worthless in effect, it is a known fact that only the diseases you applied yourself count for the various Death Knight abilities, so only a tanking Death Knight could theoretically benefit from Gift of Arthas, and a tanking Death Knight really should be using his Guardian Elixir slot on something else instead.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_985430"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I'm having a small bit of trouble with my 51/13/7 Blood rotation.<br>
<br>
I leveled as Unholy and got used to using a 2-rune primary attack. Understandably it was a rather significant change when I switched to Blood with a 1-rune primary. In general, I still enjoy the spec more than I did with Unholy, but there are still a few things I need to get sorted.<br>
<br>
One problem I'm having is my sequence priority. "Perfect" rotations look great on paper but it's very hard to maintain them in an actual fight once you factor in fight mechanics, lag, and response time.<br>
<br>
My issue is this: When do I cast Death Coil? With all the GCDs its nigh impossible to fit EVERYTHING in to a rotation, so I have to make sacrifices at times. Most people say that you never want to let your RP sit at 100 for too long, but even then, it seems to me that my Heart Strikes and Obliterates are doing MUCH more damage than Death Coil. While HS's base damage is comparable, it has higher crit damage through talents AND has a chance to proc Sudden Doom. So it seems to me that even IF I'm sitting at or close to max RP, it would still be more beneficial to use HS and Oblits rather than DC because it's going to give me more damage and more utility. Would this be correct, or am I missing something?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

If you're not missing, you should be able to deathcoil every 6 runes. Also, look for times when you're about to obliterate and one of the runes you need lights up before the other. You can sneak in a deathcoil then.<br>

</div>You need to target an NPC corpse to get a Ghoul pet, or yes it will auto-target a dead player. That said, I am finding the value of both Shadow of Death, and Master of Ghouls decreasing sharply in raids. Shadow of Death would be good if Naxxramas didn't zone you out as a ghoul after a wipe, which is a nasty bug. But the Ghoul pets themselves don't really appear to add much to PvE. They get reamed out on every boss with a smidgen of AOE, which is most of them, and contribute minimal DPS unless fully talented and glyphed.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>What? Shadow Of Death and Master of Ghouls are Talents in your unholy talent tree. Open it up and look. If the acronyms PvE and DPS are confusing you, this is not the forum you are looking for.<br>
<br>
The only reason shadow of death is bad is that there is a bug, explained above, with Naxxramas right now. Otherwise it is a killer investment for 1 talent point. 2% STR and STAM, and more dps to contribute if you die. However, Master of Ghouls does not appear to be worth it for PvE, the Ghoul dies too much and that talent point could be spent on verifiable and reliable DPS.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Disagree. Getting an epic flyer only increases on a pale horse's static worth. Not the other way around. Furthermore, its relative worth stays exactly the same.<br>

I have only considered dropping it in my pve raiding builds thus far.<br>

		<div id="post_message_987104" style="min-height: 183px;"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->This is a DK DPS build I've been playing around with a variant of while levelling, and I think it has potential in terms of both damage output and raid buffs. I was hoping to get some feeback on if I'm A) crazy  B) stupid  C) Close, but not quite there, or D) Unoriginal, and late to the party.<br>
 <br>
the build is here: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100508074542/http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=jfVGV00G0bZGMxtI0doGoq0s" target="_blank">Talent Calculator - World of Warcraft</a><br>
 <br>
The idea is to get as much synergy as possible between Blood and Frost, while picking up both Abomination's Might and Improved Icy Talons for raid buffs. The synergy comes from picking up as many Blood Strike boosting talents from both trees as possible, as well as fueling Frost Strikes with the runic power generating talents from Blood. The tradeoff is that I don't get either tree's 10% damage 5-pointer, and pass on some good Blood talents to go deeper into Frost.<br>
 <br>
That said, the boosts to Blood Strike are substantial:<br>
 <br>
Subversion - 9% Crit to BS<br>
Bloody Strikes - 18% BS damage and 60% BS bonus damage<br>
Blood of the North - 15% BS Damage<br>
Chilblains + Glyph of Blood Strike - +20% BS damage<br>
Annihilation - +3% melee special crit<br>
Guile of Gorefiend - +60% BS Crit damage<br>
 <br>
I don't know how stacked bonuses like that are calculated to do the math, but I plan on putting some time on the training dummies at 80 and WWS parsing the results, because right now it seems like my Blood Strikes are doing as much or slightly more damage on average than my Obliterates or Frost Strikes.<br>
 <br>
My current rotation while soloing is IT/PS (depending on if it's a ranged pull), BSx2, Oblit, FS. This generates Death Runes that I don't usually use, as BS is doing roughloy the same or better damage than Oblit, for half the runes. I'm running Unholy Presence, as I found I was losing more time to the GCD than I was waiting for runes to come off cooldown with no RP to Frost Strike with. The only time I change it up is if my health starts to get low or my RP fills up, at which point I'll use the Death Runes for a DS or Oblit, to give me GCD space for an extra Frost Strike.<br>
 <br>
Has anyone else tried a similar build, or can anyone see something glaringly wrong with this? It's a fun build so far, damage seems good, and I do like that it gives both the 10% AP buff and the 20% melee haste buff.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Without knowing your specific talents the answer is yes.  Tri-specs don't have a significant rp dump like the other builds so picking up gargoyle will result in a great boost in a raid/boss setting.

<br>
Thoughts on this build please?<br>
<br>
Some information:<br>
<br>
I'm setting up to be MT of a guild of RL friends.  We're basically keeping things to 1 of each class/specc, so I will be the only unholy DK.  This build is put together on the assumption that Necrosis and Blood Caked Blade will not work with Rune Strike, as I vaguely remember that from somewhere and can't find confirmation either way, and that with Butchery and BoS I will be Rune Striking almost every swing.<br>
<br>
Please feel free to pick this apart and show me where I'm being stupid.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Blizz stated somewhere in all the DK propganda that Runecarving should completely replace the DK's need for weapon enchants...That being said, you should tailor your weapon to match your goal.<br>
<br>
As Blood for DPS though, Cinderglacier is out since the majority of your damage is physical, and it won't really do much.  Lichbane and Razorice are a direct 2% increase to your swings assuming the damage isn't resisted, but Razorice has the benefit of helping increase the damage of your Icy Touch sometimes as well...That being said, it synergizes with a frost build much more than blood.<br>
<br>
Spellbreaking and Spellshattering are explicitly for tanking spellcasters, and pvp in my opinion, so those are out too.<br>
<br>
Swordbreaking / Shattering again are tanking avoidance, though extra parry keeps you alive longer while soloing.<br>
<br>
That leaves Fallen Crusader...far and away your best bet for an overall DPS increase.<br>
<br>
In short, go with Lichbane or Razorice until you learn Fallen Crusader then stick with that for damage.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Blood of the North - 15% BS Damage<br>
Chilblains + Glyph of Blood Strike - +20% BS damage<br>
Annihilation - +3% melee special crit<br>
Guile of Gorefiend - +60% BS Crit damage<br>
 <br>
I don't know how stacked bonuses like that are calculated to do the math, but I plan on putting some time on the training dummies at 80 and WWS parsing the results, because right now it seems like my Blood Strikes are doing as much or slightly more damage on average than my Obliterates or Frost Strikes.<br>
 <br>
My current rotation while soloing is IT/PS (depending on if it's a ranged pull), BSx2, Oblit, FS. This generates Death Runes that I don't usually use, as BS is doing roughloy the same or better damage than Oblit, for half the runes. I'm running Unholy Presence, as I found I was losing more time to the GCD than I was waiting for runes to come off cooldown with no RP to Frost Strike with. The only time I change it up is if my health starts to get low or my RP fills up, at which point I'll use the Death Runes for a DS or Oblit, to give me GCD space for an extra Frost Strike.<br>
 <br>
Has anyone else tried a similar build, or can anyone see something glaringly wrong with this? It's a fun build so far, damage seems good, and I do like that it gives both the 10% AP buff and the 20% melee haste buff.</div>

I am going with a build that is almost exactly the same!  : )  <br>
<br>
But with slight modifications because I am still leveing. hee. Yeah, the idea is that the blood strikes for this build are going to hit just as hard as if they were heart strikes. And the rest of the frost attacks don't suffer much because the blood talents make up for some of the damage they lost. About the only thing we lose in this build is hungering cold, which is more for pvp and aoeing anyway. I don't see anything wrong with it, and I believe its a great build.<br>
<br>
If GCD is really a problem. Maybe you can try testing it in blood presence, but don't use plague strike in the rotation at all. The reason being that plague strike hits for really low, and the buff its gives to the other strikes is actually quite negligable in the scheme of things. This is only if GCD is really such a problem of course.  <br>
<br>
Right now, I am leveling with this build and things die fast enough even without me using plague strike. I really like this build.<br>
<br>

		<div id="post_message_988141"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Hey guys,<br>
<br>
Just wondering why the DK Dps Com. puts necrosis much lower in terms of added dps than blood-caked blade?  My buddy and I tried to do some math around the two, and we came up with the 4% more white dmg dps would yield more dps than maxing blood-caked blade.<br>
<br>
if anyone could enlighten us on this we would be more than willing to listen.<br>
<br>
Also what about not specing to shadow of death and garg, and using those 2 points to max out bcb?  I know Garg is pretty good, but just wondering if maxing bcb would yield more dps in between the CD timer?<br>
<br>

		<div id="post_message_988292"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Single-target threat is not a large concern at present to say the least and AE threat is handled cheerfully (again at present) by any of the tanking classes.  When it comes to mitigation or mitigation and avoidance, tanks are somewhat different however and the present preference from healers is for excellent base mitigation with periodic and well-known tricks.  For that role, Warriors are still king by some margin.<br>
<br>
DKs excel at tanking through threat, which is largely immaterial right now, and through a number of short-term and often activated 'tricks'.  Sadly, flexing a healing routine around short cooldowns is painful and tends to lead to overheal and underheal more than anything.  At least that is my impression so far of a young class in a young expansion.  We shall see.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I agree here that it's largely just a player perception issue. DKs will make damn fine main tanks.<br>
<br>
Part of the problem I think is the almost total lack of good tanking gear for DKs until you hit the upper end of the leveling curve (a lot of which is crafted actually).<br>
<br>
Add to this the shear amount of people playing DKs who DON'T know what they're doing yet just reinforcing the misconception that DKs can't MT.<br>
<br>
Several times so far I've had members of my PUGs tell me that I was the first good DK tank they've run into since Wrath launched.<br>
<br>
Add in my own experience: there are some REALLY bad DK tanks out there. Many are being played by people who never bothered to level a tank before and are jumping at the chance to try it out now and skip the 1-58 grind at the same time (<i>really</i> bad tanks).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>As Ebon Plaguebringer doesn't stack, you'll only want one unholy DK in any given group. The second DK cannot benefit from that third disease towards +strike damage since strikes count only your diseases for bonus damage.

		<div id="post_message_988685"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->For the first time last night, we attempted to run CoT:Strat with our main DK tank, who has always proven himself to be a very good player.<br>
<br>
Group makeup was:<br>
Holy Priest<br>
Assassination Rogue<br>
Non-BM Hunter<br>
Unholy DK<br>
Moonkin Druid.<br>
<br>
Our DK kept getting destroyed by the Infinite Adversaries, in a way that I haven't seen in the many times I've run the instance with a Paladin or Warrior tank, for whatever reason. Void Strike was hitting him for over 10k on occasion, which was unhealable for our Priest.<br>
<br>
Our Death Knight tank was Mog on Malygos (he seems to be in his DPS gear at present, rather than his tanking gear) here:<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100508074649/http://us.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Malygos&amp;n=Mog" target="_blank">The World of Warcraft Armory</a><br>
<br>
Now, Void Strike hits for 125% of weapon damage, ignoring all armor, and obviously hits incredibly hard.<br>
<br>
Has anyone had this issue with CoT:Strat? Did you do anything special to resolve it? <br>
<br>
We decided to sleep/trap the adversaries, but that wastes time if trying for the timed event, and it was still fairly touch-and-go.<br>

I did burn unbreakable and icebound fortitude alternatively on each of the pulls though, along with AMS for caster stuff. Also one thing I do often when tanking is simply burn the UF runes on Death Strike instead of the usual Oblit, because I don't need threat(rune strikes and D&amp;D/bloodstrikes take care of it) but the self healing is rarely wasted.

</div>2H, I use my usual Titansteel destroyer, with a 4% parry runeforge when I tank. However I got some epic tanking 1h from heroic utgarde, and had a blue tanking axe banked from a quest, so might try DW at some point, the issue is the lack of hit% imo. I guess I could use one of my DPS piece with high hit% instead of my tanking if I get the defense off weapons though, so yeah, might end up checking it out at some point.<br>
<br>
As for the rest of the gear, def cap, 24k hps, 24k armor, usual frost tanking spec, so nothing fancy. That includes some Tempered Saronite crap to get to def cap. Tanked a few heroics and never had an issue, but in violet Hold, on the shaman bird boss, didn't expect him to hit too hard so I was slacking on cooldowns, and he fucked me up with Stormstrike+2big hits. The try after I simply rotated all my cooldowns, and never dropped under 80%.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">2H, I use my usual Titansteel destroyer, with a 4% parry runeforge when I tank. However I got some epic tanking 1h from heroic utgarde, and had a blue tanking axe banked from a quest, so might try DW at some point, the issue is the lack of hit% imo. I guess I could use one of my DPS piece with high hit% instead of my tanking if I get the defense off weapons though, so yeah, might end up checking it out at some point.<br>
<br>
As for the rest of the gear, def cap, 24k hps, 24k armor, usual frost tanking spec, so nothing fancy. That includes some Tempered Saronite crap to get to def cap. Tanked a few heroics and never had an issue, but in violet Hold, on the shaman bird boss, didn't expect him to hit too hard so I was slacking on cooldowns, and he fucked me up with Stormstrike+2big hits. The try after I simply rotated all my cooldowns, and never dropped under 80%.</div>

</div>If you mean tooltip, somewhere around(not tank speced atm) 1600-1900. If you mean actual hits, I RS for like 5-6k crits pretty often, this lvl of damage. I'd say DK tanks are the highest dps tank, which might be useful for some fights, but in heroics not really. Gives you more room for deathstrikes though(which if they full heal still generate good threat).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_989416"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->In the unholy tree there are a lot of talents of questionable value. Three talents in particular are Reaping, Desecration, and Anti-Magic Zone. <br>
<br>
Reaping can setup a PS, IT, BS, BS, ScS, ScS, ScS but that is a lot of setup for 1 extra scourge strike and you are counting on nothing unexpected happening in the next 10-15 seconds. Your only profit is one global cooldown and whatever damage difference there is between 2 blood strikes and a single scourge strike. Does this talent have any in game value for anything other than pure pve dps death knights?<br>
<br>
Desecration increases damage by 5% and slows targets, but it does not sync with epidemic forcing you to designate one unholy rune to keeping this buff up. In addition the radius is so small that when coupled with the rune refresh time this is not a viable cc abilities for pve or pvp in my opinion.<br>
<br>
Anti-Magic zone is a very expensive talent which at first looks good because of all the 0's after the 1, but it is little more than a 2min cooldown greater heal that you must pre-cast and stand under. The PvE usefulness seems very similar to Lightwell and unless I am missing something, I can find far better ways to spend 6 talent points in the tree.<br>
<br>
I find myself unable to assign these 3 talents appropriate value in either PvE dps, PvE tank, or PvP. My question is, do you guys consider any of these 3 talents essential in any sort of build?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

It's not optional, unless recent testing proves that we're better off using those runes for extra blood strikes every rotation. Which is of course possible. Even then, it offers a great deal of flexibility and is probably worthwhile.<br>
<br>
Desecration, AMZ, and a couple other talents (corpse explosion, unholy command, outbreak, OAPH, night of the dead, maybe necrosis) offer markedly lower or situational value and should probably be looked at closely before investing points.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Yes, and yes on the hit chance, though only a handful of our abilities use spell hit:  Icy Touch, Howling Blast, and Deathcoil.  Virulence in the Unholy tree will bring your spell hit more in line with your melee hit, and if you're a draenei, you're even more in luck due to the racial +hit aura.<br>
<br>
Necrosis shouldn't get a separate hit check, though the shadow damage it inflicts should be able to be partially resisted, or absorbed.<br>
<br>
BCB as far as I know won't miss if it procs, but it can be blocked, dodged or parried.  Somebody please correct me about the miss if I'm wrong.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I've seen no indication of Necro being dependent on Spell Hit. Our only talents are IT, HB, DC(?) that are effected by Spell Hit. This is what is leading non-frost specs to lean away from Virulence in the Unholy tree.<br>

</div>It's become a little bit hard to say "Just stack parry!" or "You need tons of dodge!" mainly because all the defensive stats are on a system of diminishing returns now:  The more rating you have, the more rating you need to add one percent to the skill.  While you should be able to focus more on one of the two than the other, it's probably best to try and keep your dodge and parry within a few percent of one another to get the highest avoidance possible without running into really bad diminished returns from stacking only one of the two.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Taking a quick look at the tier sets for DK, it seems we'll mostly be stacking dodge.  From what I've been able to add up so far, parry stays well ahead of Dodge while we gather tier 7.1 and tier 7.25 gear and remain above the defense floor.  This is assuming the 5% dodge from talents does not affect diminishing returns in any way, and that it is included on the character sheet.  I'm fairly certain both are true, but I'm enough of a novice around here that I always state my assumptions.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_991110" style="min-height: 183px;"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I have browsed through this thread for some answers but I haven't seen them, hence me posting here for the first time.<br>
<br>
I have a couple of questions regarding Blood DPS. I will probably be specced 51/13/7, but might consider 50/0/21.<br>
<br>
1) Someone in this thread that Virulence isn't worth the points due to the fact that the only abilities affected by spell hit are IT and DC. I am currently melee/special hit capped, but is it worth trying to get any more hit to reach towards the spell hit cap? (For example using <a id="itemlink" class="q1" style=" font-weight: bold;" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100508074800/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=42996" target="_blank">[Snapper Extreme]</a> over <a id="itemlink" class="q1" style=" font-weight: bold;" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100508074800/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=43000" target="_blank">[Dragonfin Filet]</a> )<br>
<br>
2) Due to Blood using a lot of GCDs, I read once that it is worth using Unholy Presence over Blood Presence so that there is time to dump RP. Is this the case or is Blood Presence superior?<br>
<br>
3) Finally, when Sudden Doom procs - is it worth interrupting the rune rotation to get a DC off, or should that wait until all the runes are on cooldown?<br>
<br>
Thanks in advance for any advice you can provide.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I'm currently using a Unholy tank build with lichborne.<br>
<br>
Something I'm asking myself for a moment : What's best ?<br>
<br>
- Use both Lichborne and Bone shield at the same time : With 25 % miss chance, Bone shield will last longer but how much ? <br>
<br>
- Use first Lichborne and only when he's down, get your Bone shield up. This willl provide you longer time with some protective thing on. <br>

</div>Will depend on the fight pretty much. On fights with no specific controlled burst or low environnemental damage, I'll just pop all cooldowns one after the other, so I always have something else to mitigate incoming dmg(I use the badge dodge trinket in combination with lichborne though). On some fights however, you want bone shield to stick for longer, and using lichborne at the same time is a great way to do that. Fights like long berzerk timers, or pulsing AE damage or dot. I don't believe there's one best way to use your cooldowns, unless you only consider it as overall mitigation during a whole fight, which isn't particularly useful.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>The massive bible threads were great if you already knew what was in them, and not-so-great if you wanted to find a single fact among the 100+ pages of discussion. Now at least you know which of the 5 odd threads (tanking, 3 trees, dw) are most likely to answer your question. I suspect the intent is that the content that used to live in the first post of the bible threads should move to the theorycraft think tank.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>As the above poster mentioned this would simply cast Horn of Winter every time you hit your Blood Strike button assuming you had 20 runic power available, or 10 if glyphed...Since Horn of Winter is on the global cooldown you definitely would need to use a /castsequence macro, and would still have to hit the button again at the end of the GCD to cast the next ability in the sequence.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately as of 2.0.1, it is no longer possible to use boolean logic in macros or /script commands to initiate spellcasting, so creating a macro to only cast Horn of Winter if you do not already have the buff isn't possible.<br>
<br>
The easiest way to keep it up for me has been to just bind it to a separate key, and reapply it during the RP dump of my rotation.<br>
<br>
On a separate note, HoW gives the same buff at rank 2 as the highest rank of  Strength of Earth Totem before the shaman puts any points into Enhancing Totems, and shouldn't stack under the new Wrath buff stacking rules, so depending on your raid, you may find that keeping HoW up is a moot point anyway.<br>
<br>
If you're looking for an easier way to check and see if you have the buff, you might try <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100508074902/http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info8579-PowerAurasClassic.html" target="_blank">Power Auras Classic : WoWInterface Downloads : Buff/Debuff/Spell Mods</a> .<br>

</div>For DPS, your two best options are Chaotic Skyflare (21 crit rating + 3% crit damage) or Relentless Earthsiege (21 agility + 3% crit damage).  Agility has the added benefit of upping your armor and if you have Bladed Armor, your AP slightly as well, while increasing your dodge too.<br>
<br>
For tanking, there is either Austere Earthsiege (32 stam + 2% more armor from items) or Effulgent Skyflare (32 stam + 2% reduced spell damage taken).<br>
<br>
Either one can be helpful depending on the situation, but if you're going for maximum spell damage reduction as a niche tanking role, go with the Effulgent Skyflare.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">For DPS, your two best options are Chaotic Skyflare (21 crit rating + 3% crit damage) or Relentless Earthsiege (21 agility + 3% crit damage).

</div>It's less about Obliterate and more about the fact that the second obliterate in the rotation grants you two extra death runes for more heart strikes instead of having to reapply diseases because the first obliterate removed them.  With Epidemic, your diseases last just long enough to get the bonus damage on all four of the heart strikes at the end of the rotation.<br>
<br>
Abilities: PS -&gt; IT -&gt; HS -&gt; HS -&gt; OB -&gt; RP Dump<br>
Runes: U -&gt; F -&gt; B -&gt; B -&gt; UF<br>
Abilities: OB -&gt; HS -&gt; HS -&gt; HS -&gt; HS -&gt; RP Dump<br>
Runes: UF -&gt; DR -&gt; DR -&gt; DR -&gt; DR<br>
<br>
<br>
As for glyphed DS vs. glyphed Oblit:  Glyphed DS yields 60% weapon damage + 2% / 5 runic power for a total of 40% extra + 178.  Max, that's weapon damage + 178.  Glyphhed Oblit is 120% weapon damage + 350, with an additional 350 if both diseases are up.<br>
<br>
x+178 &gt; 1.2x+700<br>
<br>
That's a very clear numerical difference unless I'm doing the math completely incorrectly.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I did not mean to imply I thought it was complicated.  It is improper usage.  "Movement speed" suggests the speed at which you move, the method of movement is unspecified, leading a logical person to presume it should apply to all forms of movement be it mounted movement, movement through water, or movement on foot.  All are movement, all should be enhanced by something labeled "Movement speed".<br>
<br>
They do indeed have specifically named Mounted Speed (and swim speed) enhancements.  Of particular note is Pursuit of Justice "increases movement and mounted movement speed".  Surely I cannot be the only one who finds that awkward if not redundant.  Having it read "Increases run speed and mounted speed" would be much more elegant.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>The problem with tying a macro like that to an ability that you use a lot is that you are going to be using runic power like crazy and wasting it. Unfortunately there is no way to tie some sort of conditional to the macro since we cannot use "If XXX doesn't exist, cast YYY"<br>
<br>
You <b>can</b> however tie abilities like Rune Strike to spammed keys, which is what I personally do. The macro for Blood Strike looks something like the following. Keep in mind that I'm using two "on use" trinkets so I tie them in as well. I prefer use the trinket name in case I have a PvP trinket equipped, which is actually tied to a different key binding so I don't use the equipment slot number.<br>
<br>
#showtooltip Blood Strike<br>
/use trinketname<br>
/use trinketname<br>
/cast Rune Strike<br>
/cast Blood Strike<br>
<br>
This will queue Rune Strike any time I cast Blood Strike. I have a similar macro tied to Plague Strike as well and it seems to keep them on cooldown most of the time. I haven't got into raiding yet on this character, but I may change this up depending on the fight mechanics and if there are any burn phases that I need to be aware of.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_993689"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I was looking at the DPS compendium again (specifically, the 51/13/7 Blood spec, which I'm working towards) and I have a question: Why is Toughness ignored, given the synergy with Bladed Armor?<br>
<br>
Also, I just noticed, Improved Icy Touch and Glyph of Plague Strike would be incompatible, wouldn't they.  Each one provides more damaged to diseased enemies, so if you have both one of the spells on your IT-PS-HS rotation (or PS-IT-HS) wouldn't get the benefit.<br>
<br>
If you weren't using the Glyph would the tradeoff of Toughness for Improved Icy Touch/Glacier Rot even be worth it?  I calculate that at 10k armor the extra bonus from Toughness would add just over 41 ap (assuming Blood Presence or Unholy Presence):<br>

</div>I think you answered your question there - 3 DPS out of around 1800-3500 DPS depending on gearing levels will not stack up at all. Imp Icy Touch is also a potential avoidance buff for your tank, if nobody else is providing a better haste debuff in the group.<br>
<br>
Personally, I actually spec 5/5 toughness, but that's mainly because I want to be able to have the armor for when I tank 5-mans (I'm still only 77, tho, so I have a leveling spec).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>41 AP does not equal 2.9 dps.  14 AP = 1 dps is not true for any melee due to having many AP-influenced attacks.  For a Ret Pally, that AP is about 24 dps.<br>
<br>
To know what is better, you would look at the addition of Icy Touch (assume 100 dps, it is likely more, Recount can tell you), so that is another 40 dps.  <br>
<br>
<br>
So toughness is not a great dps talent (outstanding for leveling/tanking/PvP though).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Spend 10 minutes on the practice dummy and report what percentage of your damage comes from icy touch and deathcoil.  These are the only spells in your spec that spell hit affects.  A one percent increase in spell hit toward the cap is a one percent increase in damage done by these spells only.  It should be pretty low (0.3% overall DPS increase, estimated).  In other words, it's nice, but you can probably find better ways to spend your gear or itemization points.<br>
<br>
Oh, this doesn't take into consideration the GCD you might lose by missing an icy touch.  So just a little more than the flat damage increase.  But still not worth going out of your way to cap.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Haste is the worst DK stat for DPS(with maybe the exception of DW builds, but even then). So no, you want crit over haste, but you don't have much of a choice. It's still beneficial, just less than other stats. And you want str/ap over either.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div class="intellitxt" id="post_message_994772"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->[quote=Pyran;993689]I was looking at the DPS compendium again (specifically, the 51/13/7 Blood spec, which I'm working towards) and I have a question: Why is Toughness ignored, given the synergy with Bladed Armor?<br>
<br>
Also, I just noticed, Improved Icy Touch and Glyph of Plague Strike would be incompatible, wouldn't they.  Each one provides more damaged to diseased enemies, so if you have both one of the spells on your IT-PS-HS rotation (or PS-IT-HS) wouldn't get the benefit.<br>
<br>
If you weren't using the Glyph would the tradeoff of Toughness for Improved Icy Touch/Glacier Rot even be worth it?  I calculate that at 10k armor the extra bonus from Toughness would add just over 41 ap (assuming Blood Presence or Unholy Presence):<br>

		margin: 0px;

		width: 694px;
		height: 98px;

11500 - 1000 = 1500
1500 / 180 = 8.33
8.33 * 5 = 41.65 ap
41.65 / 14 = 2.975 dps</pre>
</div>Are you saying trade only Icy Talons OR Glacier Rot for points in Toughness, or filling out Toughness for both?<br>
<br>
At 5/5, Toughness would add 3,000 armor to a 10,000 armor base.  3000/180*5 ~= 80AP gained.<br>
<br>
Granted, it's nothing to sneeze at, and it scales, but general theory is that five entire talent points spent for such a relatively minimal gain isn't worth it, even in a min max setting.<br>
<br>
<br>
As for Icy Touch, between Glacier Rot and Black Ice it'll hit and crit for around as much damage as Blood Strike in pre-heroic gear.  It won't approach Heart Strike and Obliterate, but it becomes a fairly strong attack, especially when it crits with the fact that it ignores armor and crits for 200% damage through class mechanics alone.<br>

</div>I'll go test it myself once the servers are back up, because honestly now I don't know.  For some reason I was of the impression that it definitely shared the common 1ppm with other enchants, but you're not the only person to have suggested differently, and what's more, it's possible there's not even an internal cooldown on it right now, though the Unholy Strength buff it grants won't stack (could have some dual wielding implications regarding approaching 100% uptime while maintaining decent healing).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Therein lies the confusion people are seeing then in assuming that 1ppm automatically means it can <i>only</i> proc once every 60 seconds instead of statistically proccing once per minute.<br>
<br>
Now for some different questions for the mix:  Which attacks can it proc from?  I'd assume every auto attack and strike, but not spells.  Also, can it proc from BCB procs?  That would lead into further discussion about any benefits of placing it on both weapons in a dual wielding build for greater uptime.<br>
<br>
Also, I checked a couple of WWS reports and noted 4 procs over 3'44" for one deathknight, and 6 procs over 3'45" for another.  Chances are that it procced more than that, but since WWS only records buff gains, and a proc while Unholy Strength was up wouldn't count towards the total, it's difficult to tell.  Still, those two in particular had a 1.08ppm rate, and 1.7ppm respectively, meaning they had 27% and 40% uptime of the buff.

</div>My understanding of the PPM mechanic is that it's even more complex. The likelihood of any strike proccing the enchant is a function of the PPM and the weapon speed. But that chance doesn't change based on haste and specials. So if you use a special every GCD and are hasted, you'll see better uptime of the enchant, and this means a slow weapon will have a better chance to proc off of specials.<br>
<br>
IOW: if you have a 1 PPM enchant, and you hit a target dummy with auto attack for N minutes, you should see N procs. If you do other stuff, you'll see more procs. That's why mongoose was so great on my rogue, it was up all the time, between the SnD buff for haste and all the sinister striking, I was attacking a lot faster than the base rate.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div class="intellitxt" id="post_message_995961" style="min-height: 183px;"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->PPM is the normalised representation of the proc rate. The chance to proc per melee swing is the thing that ends up being a function of your weapon's attack speed. For example, a 3.0 speed weapon will have double the chance of proccing than a 1.5 speed weapon, but then, the 1.5s speed weapon swings twice as often. So, in the long run, the number of procs in a given minute is equal.<br>
<br>
The uptime of the buff, however, can depend on whether or not it overwrites itself. You could have a 3m fight, but the RNG gods screw you and you end up with 3 procs on your first 3 swings and no procs for the next 3 minutes. That's an extreme example, because of odds of that are pretty damn slim, but I hope you get the idea.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>[Fake Edit: Oh holy crap I just realized you have no points in Rime. Shame on you. However, I'm too lazy to go back and change all the crap I wrote.]<br>
<br>
You have Annihilation but you never OB. You say PS won't boost your BS enough, but you're obviously trying to max your BS damage using talents (Bloody Strikes). If you're going to spam BS instead of using the Death Runes they create to OB then drop Annihilation, however considering the huge amount of damage OB will do, especially on crit with GoG, you should drop the two BS in the second part of your first rotation and just OB instead.<br>
<br>
And not PSing is just silly. Letting a rune sit unused when you'll have to wait for more to come up is no excuse really. It's free damage you're missing out on. It's a DPS boost for one GCD, fire and forget.<br>
<br>
Since the main focus of DW specs is to maximize white damage and use abilities that don't necessarily rely on weapon damage your rotations should look more like:<br>
<br>
IT -&gt; PS -&gt; HB -&gt; (OB) -&gt; BS -&gt; BS -&gt; FS<br>
HB -&gt; OB -&gt; OB -&gt; FS<br>

IT -&gt; PS -&gt; HB -&gt; BS -&gt; BS -&gt; FS<br>
HB -&gt; OB -&gt; OB -&gt; FS -&gt; (HB)<br>
<br>
The section in parentheses are what you do if Rime procced off of your first IT, making your HB cost no runes. Since you don't have Epidemic though, you're going to have to refresh your diseases more often, however that's not really an issue anyways since using IT more is good.<br>
<br>
On to your talents:<br>
You have one point in Two-Hand Weapon Specialization. In a dual wield build.<br>
No Rime in a HB centric build. Double yoo tee eff.<br>
Points buffing BS in a DW build.<br>
<br>
Personally I'd aim for something like this:<br>
<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100809231854/http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=jcZG0exhxdRhoV0sxfMh0xc" target="_blank">Talent Calculator - World of Warcraft</a><br>
<br>
Tundra Stalker is 10% more damage with your abilities when your target has FF on it, which should be always.<br>
<br>
The stuff in unholy gives your melee an extra 10%+ damage (since Necrosis is affected by Tundra Stalker/Blood Presence/etc). BCB gives you an additional melee attack to proc Killing Machine with, as well as just more free damage. While I regret not taking Bladed Armor and Dark Conviction I don't feel they play to your strengths as much (though in all honesty everyone should have Bladed Armor. It's that good).<br>
<br>
You need Rime. It's just too good for an HB focused build.<br>
<br>
Runic Power Mastery is not so good in my opinion, because you should always be dumping your RP before you can hit 100 in an instance. Soloing is a different story, but don't base your builds around soloing.<br>
<br>
Virulence helps your HB/IT hit. Once you get enough hit gear you can probably drop it and get Ravenous Dead for some extra strength.<br>
<br>
<br>
Some notes: If you're not going to OB drop those points and put them somewhere else (Rime for instance). However just realize the huge amount of single-target damage OB can do. Obviously it's a lot less dual-wielding than using a two-hander, but you need to focus your talents in places that will best boost your damage.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div class="intellitxt" id="post_message_996544"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Hey I'm new here but I've been following this thread closely and lots of great information here. However I still have a few questions that's been bugging me:<br>
<br>
1)  On the topic of item budget for tanks, I read these conversions somewhere (tankspot or wowwiki I think)<br>
<br>
39.35 dodge rating = 1% dodge<br>
41.00 defense rating = 1% avoidance (miss/parry/dodge combined)<br>
49.18 parry rating  = 1% parry (also grants haste benefit on top)<br>
<br>
With this in mind, I was wondering why people are suggesting top STOP stacking defense after the cap, and go for parry and dodge instead? <br>
<br>
With the dodge conversion and defense conversion being so close, wouldn't it be WAY more beneficial to just stack as MUCH defense as possible, even over the 540 cap, seeing as <b>defense would suffer the least from diminishing returns</b> as it effects 3 different avoidance mechanics instead of one? Can someone elaborate why stacking dodge and parry is beneficial in any way if defense is availible?<br>
<br>
<br>
2) As an unholy tank (mainly for heroics and 10-man Naxx) im currently running with this build:<br>
<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100809231854/http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=j0xZhg0zZfg0G0bkreoRcout" target="_blank">Talent Calculator - World of Warcraft</a><br>
<br>
(About unholy choices I took OaPH because I fly around alot, and I value AMZ over Desecration for 5-mans. Ghoul and Gargoyle for most dps per point, which helps loads on bosses)<br>
<br>
As you can see, I left 4 points out, cause im really unsure what would get me the most bang for the buck.<br>
<br>
I do either <b>4/5 bladed armor</b> or  <b><b>2/2 2h spec + 2/5 bladed armor</b></b>.<br>
<br>
With my gear it would come out as 290 Attack Power  vs 4% twohand damage. I see the 2hand damage being the most beneficial for single target threat, however the attackpower helps boost my aoe threat instead. Is there a clear winner here?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>There are a couple of reasons:  For one, it's harder for a DK to hit the 540 cap than the other classes due to the limited number of gear slots we have in comparison (no tanking sigils yet, only one of the two weapon slots to be used).  Secondly, defense gives us stats we purely don't need, despite giving us ones we do.  Once we reach that cap which is already taking up a large part of our item budget, it's time to move on to more specialized stats.  Look at things like the <a id="itemlink" class="q4" style=" font-weight: bold;" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100809231854/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=43565" target="_blank">[Durable Nerubhide Cape]</a> for an idea of the gearing decisions that occur when you opt between a piece of gear with +defense, and one with +dodge or +parry in the Wrath loot tables.<br>

				I think DKs may end up stacking a lot of dodge and parry just because they can't benefit from block percent or block value. They aren't designed to be avoidance tanks though -- they do have a lot of armor and some very strong active abilities for mitigation. <br>
<br>
DKs may have a harder time hitting 540 defense than warriors or paladins just because they don't have the shield slot, which often has defense on it.<br>

Defense gives you, point for point, way more avoidance than parry rating and about the same avoidance as dodge rating. However defense doesn't suffer from diminishing returns as bad as the other stats.<br>

Why should I stops stacking defense when I'm uncrittable, given the above facts?<br>

</div>You're being kind of silly here.  Of course you should stop stacking defense once you hit the cap, because at that point, Dodge is better.  And, of course, at some point, DR will make dodge worse than defense.  You can't just ignore the range in which dodge is flat out better.  Furthermore, the point at which diminishing returns makes defense worth more than dodge is <b>very high.</b>  My calculation shows that if you have only 689 defense rating (the minimum), you need 871 dodge rating before it is more beneficial to get defense.<br>
<br>
EDIT: This varies with strength and parry rating as well.  For my calculation I used 900 str, which seems normal, and 10 parry rating, just to benefit defense more and give a more conservation number.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
if i were to change to this build for using a 2h weapon would it up my dps or possibly lower it?<br>
<br>
I'm also wondering if the crit chance of OB is 24% with talents before you add in your crit rating or if it only gets a boost from the highest crit talent?<br>
<br>
I applied the OB to the DW spec I linked before and found my dps only got an added 3% from using OB. I still have not put PS in my rotation yet since I am at work but I will test it when I return home. <br>
<br>
Another question I had was whether it would be beneficial to put points into Death Rune Mastery and have all of your runes as death runes so you could use any abilities you wish at any given time.<br>
<br>
As for using Runic Power Mastery I believe it helps because I can get off more FS in a row. Currently FS is 18% of my dmg with HB being 32% and Melee at 30% as the top 3 dmg in a fight. I'm Averaging around 1400 dps now that I've added OB and focused more on using my Death Runes at the proper times.<br>
<br>

</div>The Essence of Gossamer has a 2% proc rate according to the data on WoWHead:  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100809232140/http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=60221" target="_blank">Essence of Gossamer - Spell - World of Warcraft</a><br>
<br>
Here's the important thing in my opinion about it though:  It's a shield, and you're specifically looking at Unholy tanking.  Where's does Unholy's strength come from?  Bone Shield!  Any attack absorbed fully by a shield fails to eat a charge of Bone Shield, thereby extending its duration.  The problem though lies in the fact that it only absorbs 4000 damage, which can be as little as one melee attack in heroics (unless the DK's mitigation percentages apply to damage that hits a shield effect instead of only applying to damage that passes through a shield effect).  The stamina is phenomenal once you're crit safe though, especially with stamina scaling talents.  While the stats on it don't themselves run into diminishing returns, they'll go down, down, down in usefulness the further you up the difficulty of the encounters you're taking the trinket into.<br>
<br>
As for the medal, if I'm doing the math right and you popped it whenever its cooldown was up, it would lead to an overall 1% extra dodge before DR added by the use.  It's a great trinket for quickly upping your avoidance, but deathknights are already stacked with usable abilities to increase or mitigation.<br>
<br>
That's the line of reasoning I'd go down for choosing the Essence over the Medal:  Going for the overall greatly increased effective health rather than avoidance that will be affected by diminishing returns.  Your mileage may vary.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
How works the AP contribution ? I have seen different things, but nothing really clear (maybe i miss something, there are a lot of posts)<br>
<br>
Example :<br>
a 100-100 damage, 2.00 speed, 1-h weapon (so 50 dps), with 1400 AP<br>
<br>
The auto attack will be 100+1400/14*2 = 300 damage<br>
<br>
Now, use BS, with no disease.<br>
<br>
1. BS is 300*50%+191 =  341 damage so ap contribution is 0.071<br>
<br>
2. BS is (100+1400/14*2.4)*50% + 191 = 361 damage so ap contribution is 0.086<br>
<br>
3. BS is  100*50% +1400/14*2.4 + 191 = 481 damage so ap contribution is 0.171<br>
<br>
4. an other weird thing<br>
<br>
I have no problem with normalization, but i find weird that th ap contribution is normalized and cut in half (for BS). I think the second proposition is the good, but i really want a confirmation.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

first post.<br>
<br>
I've looked through the DPS Compendium as well as other threads here and can't really find anything definitive on which runes we should be Runeforging.<br>
I have been using Fallen Crusader, but a mage in my guild has been telling me to switch over to Razorice, he says he saw a thread on here claiming the extra frost vulnerability could boost the DPS of frost or frostfire bolt specced mages by anywhere between 300-800.<br>
Only thing is, I can't find a thread stating that anywhere, and when I switched to Razorice I didn't see a boost in his DPS,<br>
 and I kinda want to keep using Fallen Crusader.<br>
<br>
I was wondering if anyone has done extensive tests/research/work to see if Razorice is more beneficial to bring to a raid if there will be mages, or if it's vulnerability isn't really that helpful.<br>
From what I can tell from the DPS compendium and other threads here, it's still kind of up in the air as to which Runeforge enchant is the best to use.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>It's exactly 5% more frost damage on the boss, assuming 3K DPS per mage, and 2mages, you're looking at a raid dps increase of 300DPS if they're only using frostfire bolts, which I'm not sure of, but I don't know much about mages. You're probably not getting this from a fallen crusader runeforge, so yeah, theorically it's better to use razorice. However on any fights that forces you to move around, the debuff won't be up most of the time because it has to be restacked, and it takes quite a decent amount of time with a 2H.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
For this build I have found that DW is doing better dps than if i changed it to a 2h spec because with DW I proc Killing Machine far more often and thus have a crit on every FS or HB. <br>
<br>
I understand that most people are saying that for a DW spec to work you want to get BCB in Unholy so that you can maximize your white dmg but I tried that and the dps just doesnt stack up.<br>
<br>
I have tried the trispec and I cant find where people are getting that BCB does that much damage to a target. In theory BCB should proc often with a 2.6 mainhand and a 1.5 offhand but when i combined these 2 weapon speeds with the trispec BCB proced few and far between. <br>
<br>
I'm just looking for a spec aside from trispec that can be used to DW and do the same if not more dmg than using a 2h. As of this post I have beaten every DK I have partied with in overall dmg and dps in 5 man instances. I would like to hear from other DKs on DW and how they make it work.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div class="intellitxt" id="post_message_999765"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Simple question: Is Agility really great for any kind of DK? More so than a Death Knight? Let me explain more clearly: A frost Death Knight in my guild claims that Agility is dire to her spec and rolls on every heavy agility item that drops. I, on the other hand, (as a rogue) am not allowed to roll on anything with strength. I understand this but isn't it hypocritical for her to roll on everything heavy on agility but I'm not allowed to roll on strength? Strength is not completely worthless albeit better for other classes but wouldn't' it benefit the raid more if the rogues/hunters got the agility heavy items? I think she has misconstrued agility with critical strike rating which is what is wanted for Frost.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

In any case, a DK will treat Agi much like a warrior will.  They get minor amounts of crit and dodge from it, and very small amounts of AC.  That's makes it vastly better than int, but still worse than a "real" DK stat.<br>
<br>
You also don't give her role.  If she's DPS that's especially silly; agi is about 1/3 as good as strength or hit for frost DPS.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>There's no buff like druids or paladins have that all tanks would have and no non-tanks would have.  The only time you'd use Frost Presence is when you plan on tanking, as you lose the 15% damage bonus of blood and gain a bunch of armor, threat, and spell damage reduction.<br>
<br>
There are a few situations where death knight would tank in blood stance, but that generally involves undermanning group quests without a healer.  You can use Death Strike to heal yourself, and the additional damage from Blood Presence generates more healing for Death Strike than the mitigation lost from Frost Presence.  In a raid setting though, this should never occur.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1001252"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Resilience does work for the crit immunity in PvE, I believe Feral Druids had to use a bit to reach crit immunity in BC. However, you're looking at defense the wrong way. It doesn't only provide you with crit reduction, it also gives you dodge, and parry(block too, but we don't use that). Gem for defense until the cap, use a trinket if you have to, we're missing out on a lot of defense rating from using a two hander, and not having a shield. When you find yourself over the defense cap, you can start switching out your gems for stamina, strength, expertise, etc.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Resilience does work for the crit immunity in PvE, I believe Feral Druids had to use a bit to reach crit immunity in BC. However, you're looking at defense the wrong way. It doesn't only provide you with crit reduction, it also gives you dodge, and parry(block too, but we don't use that). Gem for defense until the cap, use a trinket if you have to, we're missing out on a lot of defense rating from using a two hander, and not having a shield. When you find yourself over the defense cap, you can start switching out your gems for stamina, strength, expertise, etc.</div>

</div>Easy to say when you're a jewel crafter and you're putting in +27 defense gems. You have *three* of them.<br>
<br>
Seriously guys.... let's look before we mention the obvious and mislead some people into believing things are just dandy with death knight gear and tanking.<br>
<br>
FYI:<br>
Greater Inscription of the Pinnacle<br>
Requires The Sons of Hodir - Exalted<br>
<br>
**Exalted** That's a lot of dailies or lucky finds of ice shards.<br>
<br>
The issue is how to gem for hit / expertise / dodge when you're putting in 16 defense gems 7/8 slots. There's got to be a better way.<br>
<br>
As this is EJ, let's talk some basic numbers:<br>
<br>
As I calculated, resilience is 1.5 defense for dealing with crit cap. If you're willing to decrease your avoidance by a percentage, you can then gem for dodge which has a better avoidance per point basis than defense (39 dodge rating per 1% dodge versus 12 x 4.92 defense rating for combined 1% avoidance or 59 parry rating per 1% parry). Furthermore, if you check the calculations for diminishing returns you'll find that below (and after) dodge rating of 400, dodge rating is more beneficial than parry or defense.<br>
<br>
As some DKs are finding out, maintaining threat with low hit and expertise becomes difficult and the inability to maintain defense cap and gem for hit / expertise without sacrificing other stats can become tricky - or a mathematical quandry. (And limited by a budget to some extent.)<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Well if you're not going to level a tradeskill that lets you increase defense(JC/smithing mostly, maybe inscription unsure if it's a lot), you'll have to get a def trinket and keep it for a while, there's no working around that until they add the def runeforge and the def sigil. Another solution though is to wait until arena S5 starts, and get a pvp 2h sword then, along with some pvp jewelry, and just crit cap with resilience. But crit capping off resilience currently is hard because there's really not a lot of decent stuff to use since most of the pvp gear is unavailable.<br>
<br>
So in the end, the best way to tank as a DK is to level a tradeskills that is actually useful to tanking. JC is probably the best, but smithing works nicely too.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">It seems to me that Blacksmithing and Jewelcrafting offer the largest gains.  The extra gem slots in your Gloves and Boots, along with the super gems and unique-equipped BoP gems, seem to outweigh what any other profession has to offer.  The bonuses from LW, Enchanting, Alchemy, and Inscription are all nice, but in terms of total stat gain you get the most from Blacksmithing and Jewelcrafting.<br>
<br>
Convient, in a sense, in that you can work one up with Mining, then Mine up the thousands of Ore needed to grind the other from 1 to 425ish or whatever skill you get the bonuses at.</div>

	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>I've done some testing on the Shadowguard embroidery from tailoring and found it is being undervalued in every analysis I see on these forums.  The actual AP value of this proc averages at 90 AP, not the 75 which is being spread all over.  (see below for the tests I ran to come up with this number)<br>
<br>
It does not stack with traditional enchants, so you lose 22 agility to get this embroidery.  Using the DPS compendium's stat weightings for Blood Spec, the AP value of 22 agility is ~18.16 AP.  That leaves the incremental average value of the Shadowguard embroidery at about 72 AP.  While this currently doesn't beat jewelcrafting (about 84 AP) or blacksmithing (about 82 AP) in terms of average AP contribution, it beats all other professions.  It also has a different mechanic which in my opinion makes it superior to JC or BS for a Death Knight.<br>
<br>
The proc rate is extremely high, so the activation times are very predictable.  The first always comes within the first few seconds of combat, which is prime time to blow cooldowns for longer fights where the goal is to get more than one cooldown use in.  That means the 300 AP in that 15 second window is getting some additional multipliers due to cooldowns like Hysteria, gargoyle, empower rune weapon, dancing rune weapon and heroism/bloodlust.  You may be able to use the 2nd round of the above cooldowns with the 300 AP buff up as well, since the timing of this buff is so predictable.<br>
<br>
-----------------------------------<br>
Here are the results of my test:<br>
<br>
In a series of ~600 second tests (10 minutes each) the Shadowguard effect procced 12 times against a level 80 heroic target dummy in that time frame.  I ran three of these tests, and got the 12th proc at 09:46, 09:50 and 10:05 respectively.  The proc chance is rather high, but still has a random component which accounts for the variance in how long it takes to get the 12th proc.  <br>
<br>

</div>1) The separation is usual notation, it shows rotations in 2parts, which are 2 full sets of runes, until diseases drop(with epidemic). You can put them all on one line, but it'd probably end up being truncated and stuff. There's no pause however.<br>
<br>
2) Means the 2nd SS is done with the deathrunes from the bloodstrikes. No idea why he'd bother explaining that since it's pretty obvious, unless you don't understand the concept of death runes.<br>
<br>
3) Gargoyle &gt; UB &gt; DC in that order. If garg is up, use it, else use UB, and if it's already up, dump on DCs.<br>
<br>
4) Scourge Strike is usually accepted as a good unholy glyph, refreshes diseases so you can sometimes just keep going. Else you reapply as needed. Icy touch is generally a glyph everyone takes, because the 10RP outdo the 10%dmg on IT on pretty much every build, but maybe the DW stuff. Last glyph doesn't really matter, ghoul is ok though I guess, or bone shield if you offtank with that spec.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>The disease refresh from Glyph of Scourge Strike is definitely nice, but if you use Desecration in your build for the added damage modifier, you'll still need to Plaguestrike in the appropriate place.  <a id="itemlink" class="q1" style=" font-weight: bold;" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090917021312/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=43548" target="_blank">[Glyph of Plague Strike]</a> as a minor is useful here since it further ups PS's damage for the times that you have to use it. <br>

</div>For Blood, the difference after a few buffs drops down to around 4AP difference.  It's only slightly higher of a difference for Unholy due to its 1% less strength modifier.<br>
<br>
However, you're leaving a few things out:  Is this an armor piece, or a necklace / ring / trinket ?  If it's armor, it must not be plate, since plate doesn't have +AP on it anymore with the exception of two greens.  If that's the case, do you have Bladed Armor?  Because that would more than make up for the difference between the two pieces if the decision is to be based entirely on AP.<br>

</div>It depends.  What spec are you (do you have bladed armor, +STR modifier talents, etc)?  <br>
<br>
In general though, there are plenty of leather pieces out there that beat out plate pieces even when considering STR modifier talents, Kings (don't forget, it works on agility as well), Rune of the Fallen Crusader and Bladed Armor.

Question 2: With Q1 out of the way, and with the understanding that in most generic cases Rune of the Fallen Crusader is preferred, would dropping RotFC in favor of Rune of Lichbane be both a short and long term increase in damage done in Naxx and possibly Icecrown Citadel?  Naxx = mostly undead and I am guessing that Icecrown Citadel will also be most likely full of undead as well.<br>

<br>
If its after, then I guess that makes sense why we prioritise STR over AP (due to the AP we get from Strength getting both bonuses, while AP would only get one)<br>
<br>
If its before, then only Blood is going to get more out of Str than AP, since it has STR boosting talents (due to AP from either stat would each be increased by 10% independently, so neither gets a benefit over the other without the Blood talents).<br>

</div>Frost Strike is strictly superior to DC whenever you have a level-appropriate 2H weapon equipped and your spec is appropriate (ie you went 41+ into frost and buffed frost strike with all of the available talents). The only reason I have used DC since creation was a lack of Frost Strike (not enough talent points) or being out of melée and needing to dump RP.<br>
<br>
Personal Opinion: Never spec Frost Strike when DWing; you need those points in unholy to boost your white swing damage.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Frost strike benefits from killing machine and guile of the gorefiend, so even though it does less damage than death coil (although with all the frost talents, in my experience the difference in my gear is about only 10% and I have really terrible weapons) it crits at a much higher rate and for more.  This does use up km charges though so you need to make sure you have the crit rate to sustain km for howling blast as well.<br>
<br>
I don't think many people take fewer than 21 points into unholy for DWing.  Gargoyle, blood caked blade, and necrosis is too much damage in that build.  People who take FS generally take their points out from blood and possibly impurity.  Also, FS DW builds go deep into frost mainly for guile of the gorefiend, at which point taking FS is just one more point anyways.  Lastly, without impurity, FS is much more competitive with DC even without taking into consideration the crit chance.<br>
<br>
Unique talents that FS takes advantage of:<br>
Glacier Rot-10%<br>
Black Ice-30%<br>
Killing Machine-higher crit rate, depending on white crits<br>
Merciless Combat-12% on targets &lt;35%<br>
Guile of the Gorefiend-245% crits<br>
<br>
Unique talents that Death coil takes advantage of:<br>
Morbidity-15%<br>
Impurity-25% better AP scaling<br>
Virulence-3% hit if you're under spell hit cap (which, by the way, added with misery, means that your hit rating required to reach spell hit and melee special hit caps are very close, allowing you to gear for other stats).  When I'm DW specced I take virulence anyway for howling blast, but keep in mind FS doesn't need virulence to be hit capped.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>This depends somewhat on your spec. If your rotation contains very few parryable strikes, and you are using a slow main-hand, you may not be throwing out considerably more parryables than a 'normal' tank.<br>
<br>
DW tanking's viability is crimped less by parrygib and more by the necessity to stack absurd amounts of +hit, and by the DW-favouring talents not lining up too well with a build that goes for the deep frost or unholy tanking abilities.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Yes, there are lots of talents in the blood tree for healing yourself while soloing or leveling, but in a raid DPS build, there is no need to take any of them (except, perhaps, for the first point of Rune Tap as a filler)...filling your spec with things like Scent of Blood, Bloodworms, and Vendetta for end-game is just out and out silly.  The same goes for the tanking talents in the tree.<br>
<br>
Ultimately, what you end up providing to the raid is Abomination's Might, Blood Aura, Hysteria, and Mark of Blood, all of which are fairly useful, with Hysteria and Mark of Blood being <b>very</b> powerful if used correctly.  MoB provides a great relief to healers duing periods of rapid burst damage, and Hysteria, when actually used on the person in the raid that has the highest PHYSICAL DPS is huge buff...just using it on yourself certainly ups your own damage as blood, but it definitely isn't always the most judicious use of the buff.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				It was always assumed that Runes just had a pure 10 second regen time. This has proven to be false from various tests. The behaviour that has been noted is that after the first set of runes very often runes regen after 8 seconds. The current concensus is the following:<br>
<br>
Runes have a 10 second regen time. However, if you do not use your regenerated rune as soon as it comes up, it will activate a timer (up to 2 seconds, is the current theory) which will count as the Rune being used.

</div>Checking out the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090909202611/http://www.wowmeteronline.com/rank/clazz/dps/dkt/6/0" target="_blank">WOW Meter site</a>, and looking at the top 10 DKs by DPS on Patch, we see:<ul><li>Unholy (4769 DPS)</li>
<li>Frost (4751 DPS)</li>
<li>Unholy (4599 DPS)</li>
<li>Unholy (4580 DPS)</li>

<li>Unholy (4393 DPS)</li>
<li>Unholy (4354 DPS)</li>
<li>Unholy (4321 DPS)</li>
</ul><br>
That data makes Unholy look like it dominates, but I suspect that's mostly a function of the sheer number of Unholy DKs running around right now.  Certainly blood and frost can pump out very solid single target DPS in ideal conditions, and I think it's fair to say that the main criteria for picking a tree for DPS is a mostly a matter of personal preference and raid buffs right now.<br>
<br>
If your DKs are doing poor DPS as blood, it's possible changing to unholy or frost will help - but what might help more is making sure they have the right spec, optimal gear/enchants/glyphs, and are using a vaguely sane skill rotation.  Certainly changing specs shouldn't significantly lower DPS though, so if you need certain raid buffs those specs can provide, there's no reason not to except personal preference.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

MoB provides a great relief to healers duing periods of rapid burst damage, and Hysteria, when actually used on the person in the raid that has the highest PHYSICAL DPS is huge buff...just using it on yourself certainly ups your own damage as blood, but it definitely isn't always the most judicious use of the buff.</div>

As for Chrisb3's remarks on their guilds Deathknights:  If the character and guild you have linked to your EJ account is correct, and they aren't just in PVP gear, your Deathknights really, really, REALLY need to work on their +hit rating.  I don't think a one on the armory was above 5% hit chance when I checked.  Of course their DPS looks like garbage if that's the gear they're trying to raid DPS in.  I'm not saying it is, but if so, there's your issue right there.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1009415"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Here's a strange question.  I asked it on a different thread, but I figure it'd be better to ask it here.  I'm currently level 70 running a Dual Wield spec.  I went to Zoram'gar to farm up clams for cooking and noticed something completely strange.

</div>I would think Rune Strike is better simply because it is unavoidable and deals roughly twice as much threat as a normal swing. It's definitely better Threat per RP as it costs a noticable amount less than FS and generates about the same amount of threat as a melée swing + frost strike.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>You do still want to use Rune Strike in your rotation, especially with the upcoming changes involving it receiving a much larger threat modifier.  It's there to smooth out the penalties of missing with any of your attacks.  You should still find that you have enough RP for Frost Strike too.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div class="intellitxt" id="post_message_1011038"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->In my opinion it's not wise to macro RS, simply because there will be times when you want to have a specific amount of RP for something in the fight. For example, 20RP for IBF before a predictable burst, or 60RP(soon 40) for UB before adds spawns. You can stop pressing anything for a few seconds to make sure you have the RP, but that sounds a bit counterproductive to me. Instead, I bound RS to my mousewheel, so I just roll my mousewheel during the fight and RS everytime it's up, unless I don't want to.<br>
<br>
Either way though, you want to use RS every cooldown. At low level of gear threat is a non issue, but we're running into threat issues more often now that people are pushing 5k DPS, especially fury wars and their total lack of threat dumps. It's GCD free damage too, which is good.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>They're the exact same builds pretty much. Frost might be a bit better on the mitigation early on(lichborne, frigid dreadplate and ibf time+UA), but unholy has the upper hand for heavy AE encounters(halls of stone/caverns of time mostly, but every trash encounter is AE now so it doesn't hurt). I personally dislike frost, in terms of gameplay so I never actually speced it more than to test a few things out, but it's purely a matter of taste since both specs perform very well in heroics, probably equally. Blood is generally bad, until they patch then it will be pretty ok I think.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

10 Man t7 DPS helm vs Spiked Titansteel helm  - assuming the extra hit on Titansteel is wasted as i'm over hit cap.<br>

The way I see it, i'm dropping a decent amount of STR (about 24) for a little bit of melee/spell crit and a fantastic socket (8 str blue socket bonus is amazingly useful).<br>
<br>
I'm leaning towards the t7, but they're both so close, I just need some reassurance.<br>

<li>BSing lets you add two extra sockets.  That's currently worth 48 stamina, and might climb to 60 stamina with epic gems.</li>

<li>Mining is 50 stamina</li>
<li>Leatherworking, as of the next minor patch, gives 50 more stamina than the best bracer enchant</li>
</ul><br>
Of those the "best" is probably the JC/BS combo - since there's a wide variety of gem options it means you can be much more flexible with gear choices.  By contrast both enchanting and leatherworking only offer AP as an alternative to stamina, which isn't very useful for a tank.  Mining, of course, is <i>only</i> stamina.  Then again, Mining is easy to level and might even make you money.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100809231047im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":)" class="inlineimg"><!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>No idea; however, there is a relevant DK thread in the PvP forum that might have an answer for you. If I recall, DKs are looking like the solid "fifth guy" in 5s, ok in 3s, and way up in the air in 2s as they can't be built into a "survive and outlast" team (they have no way of actively burning mana, or even entering melée range after DG is used). Theory goes that they'll be rather durable as 'stance' swaps aren't as bad as a warrior or Druid, allowing them to turtle up in frost AND pop defensive CDs if they get focused.<br>
<br>
My personal experience in BGs hint at fears and stuns being a proble moreso than "simple" kiting (DG + CoI is really good for keeping someone close-ish) as IBF won't break a stun so it must be used proactively. IMO, DKs will turn into the early focus target simply because of their utter lack of stun breaks and sole fear break.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">From the DPS Compendium, Section 4.1:<br>
<br>
Basically if you use a rune in the 2 seconds after it comes off cooldown it acts as though you used it <i>immediately</i> off cooldown. There's a little more in that section of the DPS Compendium that might help you if you're still having trouble conceptualizing this.</div>

Anyway, this doesn't actually create a sub-10 second cooldown if you're using your runes the instant they're off CD right?  It's just a grace period of sorts?  I'm just trying to make sure I'm understanding some timings right while I'm thinking about my plans for 80.<br>
<br>
If I use a rune at 0 seconds, it's ready at 10.  If I use it the instant it's ready at 10 it's ready at 20.  But if I use it at 11.5-12 it's still ready at 20.<br>

<br>
   I am curious as to what the standard suggestions are for raid-level single-target and AoE threat generation for a frost build. I am at times having difficulty with a typical IT-PS-BS-BS-OB-runepower rotation and wondering if I should employ something different.<br>
 <br>
   And for AoE naturally D&amp;D-IT-Pest-HB requires a cooldown everytime it's used. Thus I'd like an alternative...and suggestions for how to continue to maintain threat after the start. Simply wait for D&amp;D each time? I constantly hear blood boil being suggested, but I find it sub-par in terms of damage....is there some built in bonus threat to it I am missing?<br>
<br>
   Further I am curious as to how big of an impact your weapon's DPS has on your threat. It's formidable, I understand, but I was curious if anyone knows more specifically (Say comparing a 130 dps two hander to a 180 or 200).<br>

</div>I recently got Demise and my threat generation went up dramatically. So to answer your question, yes a weapon's dps makes a big difference from what I can tell from my own experience.

		<div class="intellitxt" id="post_message_1017556"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->This is a thread for simple stuff, so I think that's where this goes. Is this claim true?<br>
<br>
Claim: If you don't have annihilation, you should only obliterate when you can immediately reapply diseases, such as in a place where your other F and U runes will come off cooldown in the GCDs that follow the obliterate.<br>
<br>
This is, of course, assuming you obliterate at all - scourge strike makes life easier here. I'm trying to work out DPS and Single-target tanking rotations on my own, so I can really understand how priorities work. What got me into the situation was a hypothetical blood spec where you don't have Annihilation (primarily a hybrid tank/dps spec to last me from 3.0.8 to 3.1 when I can just dual spec, in a guild that mainly runs 5-mans and heroics). No matter how I worked it out, I was popping oblit in the rotation shortly after I just used the extra Death runes in the FU slots from the previous oblit for heart strikes. With epidemic, the IT/PS applications last long enough to use death strike to generate death runes for more heart strikes, but in either case, I can't  make oblit fit into the rotation if the above claim is true. Seems I might just need to suck it up and spec frost or unholy for a hybrid build.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Your lack of ability to hold threat *the day after you ding 80* against people in NAXX 25 gear?<br>
Tyhere is no spec to fix that, you need a high dps weapon and hit/expertise cap + some better tps gear than you will have gathered from levelling up.<br>
<br>
To draw comparisons, in TBC would you have expected a new 70 to stroll into a SSC raid and hold aggro from a full raid nuke at  Morogrim? or to do the same at supremus?  While DKs are pretty 'imba' in places, they aren't automagically godlike.<br>
<br>
As an aside, the one major concern that the DK tank community has, is the lack of Single Target threat in *all* specs.  Especially as raids gear into Naxx25/Malygos25 gear.  I'd suggest scouring the Tank thread on this forum for info, but also have a look at one of the many 'bluetracers' like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100809231443/http://blue.mmo-champion.com/" target="_blank">MMO-Champion BlueTracker</a><!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I'd suggest a build like this: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100809231643/http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=j0E0VZZfg0ctc0gcV0csut" target="_blank">Talent Calculator - World of Warcraft</a><br>
<br>
Basically an Unholy dps build, (sans the pet talents), with some tank talents. You don't need Lichborne as much as you need threat, and you can put all of the points in Frost into DPS talents. (This is just so you can maximize threat.)<br>
<br>
Pets do not contribute to TPS at all. Until you are geared up drop the pet talents. I see no problem losing Shadow of Death because it sounds like your friends out-gear the heroics and the extra stamina won't count for much.<br>
<br>
Remember UB and DnD are good for single target threat as well as AE threat.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div class="intellitxt" id="post_message_1020784"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I'm a bit curious over some of the choices - isn't Two-Handed Weapon Specialization worth it for single-target tanking, increasing BS and PS? Rather than a talent like Dark Conviction or Necrosis (considering I RS most of my autoattacks already). Also Ravenous Dead, with all the strength on tanking gear currently. I'd rather not remove all of my defensive talents as I'm still undergeared for heroics, so I'll probably go for something in between. <br>

		<div class="intellitxt" id="post_message_1025780"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I've recently come to a gear decision that I had to choose between (65haste) and (4str+6hit+28crit) for a 51/13/7 specced DK. Having read most of the theorycrafting articles on DKs I was expecting the second option to outweigh the haste without problems. However, when I switched from option 1 to option 2 I witnessed an overall dps decrease of 10, thus 65haste&gt;4str+6hit+28crit. Or using the numbers in the dps compendium that would mean that 65haste&gt;58.2618 or 1haste&gt;0.8963. Comparing this to the number in the compendium (0.564) that is about 60% more. And finally to get to my question - is it possible that haste is actually quite underrated for DKs and are there simulations working on that?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I am just trying to point out something interesting I noticed that seems to contradict the current commonly-accepted valuations. Even calculating without the hit as you showed we get that the smaller EAP value of 36,66 belongs to haste, which however, grants more dps (altho not a lot more). The tests I did were 5-minute ones on the l83dummy.<br>
<br>
Another interesting thing that I noted in these tests is a trend of about 100dps more while dpsing in unholy presence as compared to blood presence. This pushed me even harder into thinking that haste has a higher value.<br>

For reference, I am a standard Unholy DPS spec. I do not have access to any 25-man gear, and thus my choices are amongst the following four:<br>

<br>
Now I understand that Sigil of Haunted Dreams' bonus is being changed from haste to crit. I am wondering if anyone could suggest whether this change would be enough to offset the increased damage from SS (I'm leaning towards this one just because SS is such a major attack especially once glyphed), Icy Touch or DC.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

You have to promise me that you will go to the Theorycrafting Think Tank after you read this and read the Deathknight DPS entry after reading this post.<br>
<br>
For DPS: HIT raing to cap and never above (8%) &gt; STR &gt; CRIT &gt; Expertise to 5.6% ... ------&gt; +AP&gt;, haste, arpen.<br>
<br>
However, Gearing is not that simple. In your search for the best items, it is better to learn what stats to <b>avoid</b> than it is to know what stats to value slightly over others. <br>
<br>
IE: Strength and crit are both great for DPS. We know STR is better because it scales with our ghoul, with Blessing of Kings, and with talents. But what is more important is knowing that you want to avoid ratings like Arpen and hit above 8%, because their benefits are awful for you.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">You have to promise me that you will go to the Theorycrafting Think Tank after you read this and read the Deathknight DPS entry after reading this post.<br>
<br>
For DPS: HIT raing to cap and never above (8%) &gt; STR &gt; CRIT &gt; Expertise to 5.6% ... ------&gt; +AP&gt;, haste, arpen.<br>
<br>
However, Gearing is not that simple. In your search for the best items, it is better to learn what stats to <b>avoid</b> than it is to know what stats to value slightly over others. <br>
<br>
IE: Strength and crit are both great for DPS. We know STR is better because it scales with our ghoul, with Blessing of Kings, and with talents. But what is more important is knowing that you want to avoid ratings like Arpen and hit above 8%, because their benefits are awful for you.</div>

</div>This is typical.  Some people drop IT for something else, usually Bone Armor.  I think the consensus is that IT is the better glyph overall unless you're going to try and OT without changing your glyphs.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>After the next patch this becomes really murky again. I'd highly suggest sitting tight until second/third looks can be taken at the changes to see if it's even worthwhile to swap to Unholy. Heck, to be honest, Blood seems to be the most *interesting* tanking tree after the changes simply because it does things so differently.<br>
<br>
Regardless, the current napkin math seems to be suggesting that Frost will be better than Unholy overall but Unholy will still be superior at tanking casters due to Bone Armor's universal damage reduction on spells and their talents that buff overall resist, AMS, and AMZ (even though AMZ is the weakest of the three spell-soaking options).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Personally this only happens when there are a ton of mobs taking damage with D&amp;D.  So it's an issue of your internet connection dealing with all that information.  That's at least my take on it, might be different for you.<br>

It's the best minor glyph DKs get. IBF is pretty useless in my opinion for raid tanking, good for PvP though. You're never going to be that RP starved, and if you are you have 2 options to get RP back fast, empower rune weapon and bloodtap. Unbreakable glyph is good, or Frost Strike for threat, if you're going frost. Both much better choices in my opinion than IBF.<br>

		<div class="intellitxt" id="post_message_1028615"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Hey guys, I searched for it, tested it and what not, I simply have to ask now:<br>
<br>
In one of Jame's Leveling Guides (the DK one) there is an Unholy DPS rotation mentioned. IT- PS - SS - BS - BS - RD - SS - SS - BS - BS - RD; Yeah I hate leveling and it makes it just easier..<br>
Due to my lack of knowledge of the DK class i just took it and well, fine.<br>
But now there are of tests, maths and so on out, especially in this very forum and there is one rotation that comes out on top (actually I haven't found any other): IT - PS (or reverse, but for the purpose of leveling, I start with IT) - BS - BS - SSx4 with runedumps between 1st and 2nd, and 2nd and 3rd if there's time.<br>
I spent so much time testing, but I just don't see the "standard" rotation that is mentioned in this forum to come out on top. I just do a little more DPS with the first one. <br>
Specc I'm using: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100809231935/http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/classes/deathknight/talents.html?tal=2304020000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000230210305023115203100203133151" target="_blank">WorldofWarcraft.com -&gt; Info -&gt; Classes -&gt; Death Knight -&gt; Talent Calculator</a><br>
I took reaping for testing purposes, I don't need it for the first rotation, death runes are used for BS.<br>
<br>
Maybe I just overlooked something, or SS simply scales better?<br>
<br>
I'd very much appreciate your help, thanks in advance!<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

3. Look, it is perfectly alright to come here with a basic question or a weird one that you can't really search an answer for, but rotations for <b>leveling</b>? Are you kidding me? The only reason you ever cast Scourge strike before blood strike as Unholy is because using SS early will the kill the mob faster. But seriously, having a rotation for leveling is absurd.<br>
<br>
4. Death Knights are <b>the</b> best leveling and PvE aoe class in the game at the moment. you could chain plaguestrikes for all I care, you would still kill the mob. Testing for an optimal leveling rotation is absurd. Apply your diseases and fatfinger some strikes.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Take my advice and wait on the min-maxing until your DK is max level, the class is actually very hard to maximize DPS on, so hard as to be almost impossible, since the real min-maxing comes down to a very refined command of rune timers, the GCD, your runic power (not going over the max with abilities), a priority based rotation, and then obviously gearing and gemming.<br>
<br>
Enjoy the easy mode leveling experience, this enitre forum generally recommends Unholy-based leveling for 'On a Pale Horse', Boneshield and SS. Take wandering Plague and mow down massive packs of dudes. Leveling doens't get much faster.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I've been hearing a lot lately about the two new Blacksmithing "swords," but I hadn't seen them since they aren't in the patch notes.  I just got onto the PTR today and took a look at 'em.  It is nice that they're giving us some tanking weapon love, but is it worth it?  From everything else I've heard, Death Knight tanks are supposed to get a big heavy-hitting DPS weapon to keep threat that maybe has some stamina and agility on it.  If you're already defense capped, is it worth grabbing the Defender?  And since parry isn't that great anyway, is the Deflector worth it at all?</div>

</div>Blizzard said they were considering 3 things to help newbie DKs reach the defense 'cap' (or 'floor', or whatever you want to define 540 defense skill as): Sigils, a Runeforge enchant and weapons. Wouldn't you know it, they decided to go with all 3. <br>
<br>
That's what the weapons are directed towards, but the Defender is a very good weapon for pure avoidance, despite its low DPS and item level compared to other weapons you can pick up in N or H Naxxramas. Actually, its the best weapon for pure avoidance if you don't need to worry about your threat generation as much (e.g. Patchwerk), so I hope they make it BOE before it gets rolled off the PTR and I can get my hands on one without having to drop LW.<br>
<br>
Personally, I don't think they're necessary (the runeforge and sigil are MORE than enough to get a newbie DK to 540 defense skill with only a rudimentary amount of effort), nor do I think its a good idea to release them. People will probably start complaining "I can't pick up Death's Bite because I can't afford to drop the 90 defense rating on this thing!", then they release even more powerful 2H tanking weapons in the form of boss drops, and then you get raids constantly DEing that "God damned 2H tanking sword" again.<br>
<br>
And no, stay the hell away from the Titansteel Deflector.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

2Hand Unholy is currently the best single target DPS spec until a certain level of gear is reached ( a level we haven't seen yet). Some would argue that Dual-wielding is on par with Unholy, but I very much doubt it, despite the recount parses. Blood scales better than Unholy, and will surpass it once gear levels rise.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>That's all fair and good, however you did pretty much say "these are some of my stats, make me better at dps" (rather politely but still). This isn't really the thread for questions that vague. Had it been "these are my stats, should I go for more hit or crit?" (or something like that) this would've been the perfect thread.<br>
<br>
And, yes, dump some hit for crit; you only need 8% these days and I *think* that 302 is over that number. The best option would be, of course, to swap some gems around since you can convert ratings at a 1:1 ratio that way.<br>
<br>
For future reference, go grab Rawr from the general Class Mechanics forum, load your charcter in, and swap your rotation to the Unholy option. It should get you some good gear reccomendations as far as general upgrades go. The one caveat is that it thinks that Death Knights are pallies so you have to load upgrades from armory and then make our T7 wearable by a paladin to see how they compare.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>We have an entire thread in these very forums dedicated to discussing the various aspects of tanking. I suggest you read through it in it's entirety (however long it may be); you will find that virtually all of your questions about tanking will be discussed there: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090805214250/http://elitistjerks.com/f72/t36998-dk_tanking_discussion/" target="_blank">DK Tanking Discussion</a><br>

</div>In his PM box? Seriously though, I solo onyxia every timer with my basic raiding spec, which is unholy tanking stuff.

</div>Very interesting... So Necrosis and BCB are both considered to be Melee specials?<br>
<br>
Additionally, wouldn't a DW spec that takes HB be at least moderately interested in capping that since I'd assume it would be 20-30% of their damage? (I'm very unfamiliar with the latest DW spec aside from it containing Garg. and tending to have somewhere around 31 Frost for HB)<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I still use Grid (ex healer) as it provides a good base of what's going on (which people took damage or have a debuff), it also shows aggro kind of in the way you want it to (be it a dot in the frame, red square, red border, whatever you want). Couldn't miss it for the world. I've also used Needtoknow to track my own buffs (Bone shield/UB/IBF) and target debuffs, but it tends to bug a bit sometimes (might be related to my own UI), so I'm probably reverting back to Classtimers.<br>
<br>
If you want it simple, Xperl does that for you, at the cost of some performance. It will also display a red border (but just for party) and allows you to set your own debuffs double sized under the target frame - quite handy actually.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Wowhead claims Titansteel destroyer, and while it does have most strength and good bit of hit, does it really make up for the higher dps on some higher ilvl weapons like armageddon? I'm sure this has been asked before but I didn't find answer by searching.<br>
<br>
EDIT: It would be nice if someone could throw together a quick comparison of hc naxx 2handers and titansteel destroyer, just to see how they compare. Something like titansteel &lt; x wep &lt; z wep &lt; y wep is fine. Assume any hit gained won't bring you over cap.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>RP dump was implying I had 40 RP, no runes up, no RS lit up, and decided to frost strike.<br>
<br>
Until last night I had Rune strike bound to one of my middle mouse buttons, and would mash it whenever the icon lit up. Which seemed like a better idea than mindlessly macroing RS to every ability. But, turned out to be one more thing to babysit. However, last night I macro'd Rune Strike into all my rune-based attacks and had little threat issues, and absolutely zero issues when I had BoSanct.<br>
<br>
I'll edit my other posts to make that more clear.<br>
<br>
Another thing that helped was prioritizing Oblit as long as IT was up. Seems like a simple idea, but I'm typically DPSing in raids and am used to having my runes always up in the order I need them. A string of 3 miss/dodge/parry while trying to make that blood rune a death rune while a F/U was up wasn't doing it<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>It depends on your spec. A deep blood spec gets capped almost accidentally, and DW specs don't have as much use for expertise (most of their attacks are spells). If none of the expertise on the trinket is wasted for you and you are 2h Frost or Unholy (or Blood, though it would be odd to be uncapped), it's an excellent trinket. Mirror and Greatness are still far the best if you have a gargoyle.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Currently we're raiding with 3 DKs in the guild at the moment, one being Blood and two Unholy (I'm 32/39 however). I was wondering how the stacking of Ebon Plague and Crypt Fever from two different DKs stacked.<br>
<br>
If I don't take Crypt Fever at all I presume it will not add damage to abilties such as Blood Strike that increases per disease on target, but wouldn't taking 3 points in it be a waste? Presuming that Ebon Plague from another Unholy specced DK will overwrite my Crypt Fever debuff and thus wasting some of the points in Crypt Fever. While I havn't really gotten around to test this, and struggle to figure out how to do this accurately I was hoping someone could answer the question here.<br>

</div>Though that is the intended behavior, at the moment both diseases are counted (60% bonus to diseases). This will presumeably be fixed in the next patch.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, I think he was asking about the number of diseases for the purpose of HS calculation. If the other dk has EP up, your crypt fever *does* count as a third disease (and will be up). When they fix the double-bonus bug, check again - I expect either Crypt Fever to get a 'there is a stronger spell active' message, or to be up but inactive (in which case 1/3 crypt fever would be plenty).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Consider that you'd likely be swapping the sigils several times over a 3 minute boss fight.  Let's just say five times as an arbitrary example.  That's five seconds lost.  If you had put out 5000 DPS consistently for those 180 seconds without swapping sigls, your total damage would have been 900,000.  Now take off the five seconds worth of GCD's for a loss of 25,000 damage, assuming your DPS didn't change.<br>
<br>
In order to make up the same amount of damage for losing five seconds, swapping sigils would, in this case, have to offer a 142-143 DPS increase.<br>
<br>
EDIT:  Obviously this example has some flaws of its own, such as the fact that you're still doing damage while GCDs are happening because of white swings, and disease ticks, but this is still what you have to look at:  Would swapping sigils make the attacks that you use do more damage than the five that you lose out on?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Everyone says that 5/5/5 is fundamental for a tank. Since frost has the -3% chance for melee to miss would that counter the 3 points I'm losing in anticipation in order to properly fill out blood/frost?

		<div id="post_message_1041466"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->The question isn't whether Frigid Dreadplate counteracts the loss of dodge. The 5% dodge isn't a requirement by any means. It's just really powerful and really easy to get so there's virtually no reason not to get it.<br>
<br>
What you need to look at is whether the talents you're getting instead of that dodge are worth it. These talents are likely Mark of Blood (no; we have sufficient cooldowns that this is unnecessary and the blood rune cost is clunky), Unbreakable Armor (likewise), and a point in Veteran of the Third War (maybe, since effective health can trump avoidance). I've done considerable tanking with 27/44/0 and 23/44/4 and I didn't get shot down with a lightning bolt from the sky for my audacity or anything. And Anticipation is the least valuable of the three 'required' talents by a pretty decent margin. But obviously 27/44/0 is stupid when you have someone else providing 10% ap, and while I stand by 23/44/4 as a good spec it's hardly the be-all and end-all either, and 22/44/5 very well might be pretty much superior.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Hmm, maybe there is some confusion in what I'm suggesting.  I am talking about post swapping the sigil after you've done an attack in order to have the sigil equipped for your next ability.  I was able to swap a sigil immediately after performing a rune-required move while I was still in the GCD from that move, it did reset the GCD, but with a macro, the difference should be nearly negligible.  Although, I haven't tested with a macro, I was only clicking to equip the sigil while watching both swing timers and GCD timer.<br>
<br>
As an example, after your last obliterate, you'd swap in the heartstrike sigil.  Since you'd already be in the GCD (From the attack), you'd only lose anytime due to latency of the macro processing the equipment switch (which is usually minimal, depending on latency).  You would not be incurring any additional full duration GCDs, only a fraction of one.  You'd only use the macro on the last attack in a string.<br>
<br>
basically a psuedo-macros would look like, <br>
/cast obliterate<br>
/equip heartstrke sigil<br>
<br>
/cast heartstrike<br>
/equip obliterate sigil<br>
<br>
so a rotation might look like (rotations are just for illustration purposes, note that the rp dumps aren't listed)...<br>
PS - IT - OB(macro'd) - HS - HS<br>
HS - HS - HS - HS - HS - HS(macro'd)<br>
<br>
If you're talking about swapping a sigil when you're not in the GCD, then yes that is a clear dps loss.<br>
<br>
*EDIT*  So applying this to your example, instead of loosing 5 seconds for 5 attacks, you might lose 1-2 seconds over 5 (I'll liberally extend it to 6) cycles (which is 1 min).  The lost time would be negligible, you'll lose more time running around in most fights.  Further applying this to your example, you'd lose out on anywhere from 5-10k out of 900k damage, which is less than 1%.  So would the extra crit chance from the sigil swapping make up this difference?  (Testing to come once the patch is released, or I get enough time to hit the ptr)<br>
<br>
*EDIT*  Testing completed.  Confirmed that switching sigils resets the swing timer.  So the swapped sigils has to be pretty overpowered to be worth the time, or more plainly put, don't bother.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1042359"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I am creating an odd tanking build (intended for speed-running heroics, not for tanking raids) that is similar to the 32/39 DW build - it looks like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090819085725/http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?deathknight=0050000000000000000000000003250530100430000321030100000035232030100115003100000000000&amp;glyph=021915050402" target="_blank">this (5/36/30)</a><br>

(Don't answer that unless you have done some experimentation yourself, or can link to someone who has - I'm a fairly rigorous scientist).<br>
<br>
2) This is mostly for theorycrafters coming from a Warrior background: if something has a PPM, as they said KM probably will, would it have the same frequency for each 1hander as it does for a 2hander?

</div>Either unholy or 32/39 will work well at that point. 32/39 has the advantage of performing *absurdly* well on aoe trash - you'd end up near the top of the meter if they let a meter run the entire evening. DW also has the advantage that rogue epics aren't terrible, and generally beat plate blues (that's not really the case for the two-handed builds). On the other hand, 2h Unholy keeps up with that just fine on single-target boss fights, and is much easier to handle - you'd have more attention to spare for staying out of the fire.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1044972"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Janraea: On what grounds are leather epics better than plate blues specifically for DW and not 2H? My numbers show it very much the other way around. DW's absurd critrates on its higher damage attacks mean that <i>even more</i> crit (from the agility increasing KM procs (slightly)) provides a rather lackluster increase compared to additional attack power. On the other hand the benefit gained from strength over 'equivalent' AP when using Kings and ghoul is quite large. Comparatively, a frost or blood 2H build gets much more benefit out of rogue stats than a ghoul build. Bladed Armor can't come close to compensating.<br>
<br>
Now, comparing an unholy 2H build to a DW build it comes down to Bladed Armor versus the fact that DW builds have much more spells and thus get less direct benefit from agility. This isn't a comparison I can do via quick napkin math because of the secondary benefit DW gets from agility of increased KM procs. Logically it seems like DW gets the better deal but my numbers suggest otherwise.

I've been perusing different dual wield DPS specs, as well as tanking and DPS rotations.

It was vaguely answered by someone, but they didn't exactly explain why that was a good idea. Perhaps I'm missing context.. I went straight from leveling with IT &gt; PS so that I could pull at range when DG was on CD, and since we don't have the patch yet, aggro tapping hasn't been implemented yet, so to flag my mobs, I had to do something quickly to damage. Since 77 (up to 80 now) I've been tanking tanking tanking, and have always used IT first, very possibly out of ignorance.

</div>As far as I know, the only reason to use PS before IT is due to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091126052537/http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=49790" target="_blank">Glacier Rot</a> talent (top tier of the frost tree).

</div>It seems that way, but your spell crit rate is almost unrelated to the spell crit value on your character sheet - physical crit increases the number of crits your spells get by *far* more than spell crit would (it is not a 'secondary benefit' at the entry raid level). A character with *zero* spell crit chance but the same physical crit chance I have right now would make it past 85% crits on IT and HB as 32/39.<br>
<br>
The reason rogue gear works better for dw builds is that it's overloaded with hit and expertise - those stats are much less useful to a two-hander build, most of which are expertise capped accidentally and none of which get anything out of hit past 8%. Unlike dw gearing lists, 2h gear generally says 'cap expertise, cap hit, get as much strength as you can'. A dw guide on the other hand lists hit as almost as good as strength right up until the spell hit cap. If you can find enough plate gear with no hit on it, and avoid going much past the expertise cap, you're right - strength wins out. But if he's taking whatever gear he can find for a few weeks, dw gives him more room to work with on all those stats.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Counteracting the minimal boost Glacier Rot provides to your first rotation (for dual wield):<br>
<br>
Examine these two rotations:<br>
IT-PS-BS-HB-BS-DC<br>
IT-PS-HB-IT-IT-DC<br>
<br>
PS-IT-BS-HB-BS-DC<br>
PS-IT-HB-IT-IT-DC<br>
<br>
The second rotation has an IT just before an HB. This is a huge no-no. You want to maximize KM procs to benefit HB by inserting spacers before the HB. PS serves this purpose nicely.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>Right now, as a Frost tank, I'm using the only defense two hander in the game I can find (until the patch that is) and my general rotation goes something similar to this, though a lot of the time I'm watching the action bar for abilities to be ready. I'm aware this is a shotty method, and that it isn't maximized for best TPS possible, which is why I'm asking in here.<br>
<br>
I usually go IT &gt; PS &gt; BS &gt; BS (for Blade Barrier ASAP) &gt; HB &gt; FS &gt; FS and from there it goes into whatever I can use due to rune cooldowns. I'm sure this is a very ganky way to do it. Any suggestions? I tried switching to PS &gt; IT a couple days ago, and not being able to pull with IT was difficult for me to adapt to so I went back worrying that due to lack of experience with that rotation, that I wouldn't be outputting maximum threat.<br>
<br>
Also, is it better in general to use Deathchill for an Icy Touch or a Howling Blast? So far in tanking I've taken the habit of, for AOE pulls (the above progression was for single target) IT &gt; PS &gt; Pestilence &gt; BS &gt; BS &gt; pause until HB is ready, then Deathchill &gt; HB. I figured, perhaps incorrectly, that i would load threat on due to critting all of the mobs in front of me with the IT damage enhancer enabled. I have gotten my tanking down to numbers and theory yet because I don't understand how the numbers/formulae work particularly, but I'm hoping to get there soon...<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1045401"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Ah I hadn't even examined which runes were cooling down in that AoE rotation. I'll give that a try and see how it goes. As I was farming today I experimented with my subconscious rotation of spells and I think this is roughly it:<br>
<br>
Single Target Rotation: ( I don't have Glacial(er) Rot)<br>
IT &gt; PS &gt; (DC if up) HB &gt; BS &gt; BS (for Blade Barrier) &gt; FS &gt; FS &gt; IT &gt; PS &gt; (DC if up) HB &gt; BS &gt; BS<br>
(I occasionally throw in a Death Strike before my RP dump if I'm low on health to scale my DS glyph's heal bonus, and also hit Runestrike whenever it becomes available. I don't know if thats beneficial or takes up a spot in the rotation, it seems like you hit it and wait for it to go on a white hit or something, I haven't quite figured it out)<br>
<br>
That's a little more towards DPS I suppose, then to tanking, but it follows the general method that I use when tanking.<br>
<br>
Also just realized that my glyphs aren't set correctly.. I still have a Bone Shield glyph from when I was tanking in Unholy. Going to have to find suitable replacements.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the comments so far, I really appreciate the help.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>For Unholy builds, Rage of Rivendare buffs all spells and abilities by 10% when the target is infected by Blood Plague (a disease applied by Plague Strike); a minor additional reason to use PS prior to IT.<br>
As a tank, however, if I can't Death Grip the mob to me, I hit them with IT first due to range as they close in on me. This places me 1.5 seconds further into my rotation that would have otherwise been wasted waiting on range.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1047365"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->It's been reported that Intellect has no effect on our spell critrate (in addition to Agility having no effect). Even if this were not true, it's something like 133 or 150 intellect per crit nowadays. It's hardly going to counteract the difference between 180 AP and 50 STR - which is actually less of a difference than it appears, to be honest, but I haven't seen APEP values for STR above 3.4x in the most extreme cases, and it requires 3.6 to make the elixir match the flask.<br>

Elixir of Empowerment most likely works exactly like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091126052537/http://elitistjerks.com/f47/t15548-spell_penetration/" target="_blank">Spell Penetration</a> in that it can affect bosses like Sapphiron with abnormal resistances, but not your average boss's base resistance for being level 83.

</div>Fast/fast provides more auto attacks. More auto attack critical strikes = more KM procs, and when KM procs it means your next HB is a critical strike. HB is the DW most dmging ability, so KM procs are most important, which leads to fast/fast the better choice.<br>

</div>Generally, no - the rotation you give has IT immediately before HB, which tends to keep the Killing Machine procs from being used to best effect. Try IT,PS,HB,DC,BS,BS,DC - IT,DC,HB,DC,IT,IT if you need to use a rotation.. Unless you have both the spell hit cap and expertise cap, you'll really be using a priority rotation even on patchwerk though - keep your diseases up, cast HB when it's available, IT if not HB, and DC if neither IT nor HB is available and both diseases are up. If KM is up and HB is almost up, use DC instead of IT.<br>
<br>
As far as the rime macro - ignore it. It won't help you except on a few bosses, and only if you *nail* your rotation timing - unless you're putting out 5k dps or higher, just don't worry about it.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>A rime proc-using HB only gives 5 RP (if you have Chill, none if you don't). While it is technically better dps to use the rime proc and cast an IT afterward before continuing with the previous rotation/priorities, it's not a big gain, and proc-watching uses a lot of attention. If the skills are going to be cast in the same order anyway, cancelling the proc gets you an extra 15 RP.<br>

</div>It should, considering they are two separate sources of haste.<br>
<br>
<br>
And question:<br>
The "ideal" DPS rotation for Frost DKs is:<br>
IT-BS-OB-OB-FS Repeat<br>
<br>
But the tanking rotation everyone uses is(I think):<br>
IT-PS-BS-BS-OB-FS<br>
IT-PS-OB-OB<br>
<br>
<br>
Am I wrong in using the DPS rotation while tanking, under the mindset that more dps = more threat. On top of one less parryable ability per rotation?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1050668"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->That wasn't an 'optimal' rotation, it was the only one I tried. I got it off some post in the DW thread way back probably by Gothya. It looked very good so I didn't mess around with it.<br>
<br>
It skips an unholy rune, not a blood rune; like the Antiseptic 2H Frost rotation, it assumes one death rune active per rotation segment from either a Blood Tap before the pull or from replacing an IT with a BS in the very first rotation.<br>
<br>
I've definitely soured on the whole rotation idea though. I never use one in practice anyway. I've started recoding my tool to use priority systems instead, but the complexity of doing so (and doing it well) necessitated a complete restart and switch to C++, which adds considerable interface design overhead time. So don't expect anything more from me on that front for at least another week.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

The points in dirge, epidemic, and unholy aura are all at-will - if you want desecration, move some there. This spec will change somewhat after 3.0.8, if you want a version for post-patch, pm me and I'll send you another.<br>
<br>
2) No rotation at all, but a priority system. <br>
Simple priority: IT(no fever) &gt; PS(no plague) &gt; HB &gt; IT &gt; BS &gt; DC &gt; PS<br>
<br>
Complicated priority:<br>
IT(no fever) &gt; PS (no plague) &gt; HB (KM up) &gt; IT (KM down) &gt; HB (KM down) &gt; IT (KM up, DC instead if waiting one gcd will let you cast HB) &gt; BB/BS (either of, depends on gear) &gt; DC &gt; PS (plague up)<br>
<br>
If you really can't manage the simple priority, use the rotation:<br>
IT,BS,BS,PS,HB,DC - IT,IT,IT,PS,HB,DC,DC (no IT glyph)<br>
<br>
Generally, use BB if you're spell hit capped and not expertise capped, or if you have at least 20% spell haste from gear+buffs, or if you can hit more than one thing.<br>
<br>
Edit: Forgot to say - gargoyle is a big damage source for us. He takes his stats from the moment of casting, so you want to pop trinkets/racials, and you want to do that after any strength/ap increasing procs go off (mirror of truth, greatness, unholy strength). You can boost his dps by 20-30% by casting him with an extra 1.5k ap. Also, when he's out, don't cast DC - he'll be eating your rp, and you can't make it fast enough to keep him out the full duration if you spend much of it.<br>
<br>
3)Until patch, Fast/Fast is *far* better. After patch, it doesn't matter much - Slow/Fast will probably be slightly better.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">- The 2h hit cap is 8%, both for autoattacks and specials. 8% melee hit is ~262 hit rating, which is approximately 10% spell hit (as the conversions are different).<br>
<br>
- The spell hit cap is 17%. If you have Virulence and either Misery or Improved Faerie Fire, this is 11%. Considering that you should be aiming for 8% hit for melee, you'll end up with 1% spell miss with virulence and buffs, or 7% spell miss without virulence and buffs.<br>
<br>
- Expertise removes 0.25% dodge and parry from a bosses avoidance per point. Each point takes ~8.2 expertise. The approximate values are 6.25% dodge and 15% parry that you need to overcome. This makes expertise approximately twice as valuable as hit up to the point at which you are capping dodge avoidance (26 expertise).<br>
<br>
This makes hit very valuable up until 8% melee hit (262 hit rating), and expertise very valuable up until 6.25% reduction (26 expertise).</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I've been reviewing my Be Imba page and while I've met the melee cap, I have not met the spell cap. I'm confused on how exactly to raise the my spell hit - I figured that capping melee hit would do it up until capping melee hit didn't... how do we do it? And is it really a vital statistic over say AP and Crit?</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>To reach the spell hit cap after reaching the melee hit cap, you just keep stacking more hit rating.  In Wrath of the Lich King, crit, hit, and haste rating were all made to affect both melee and spells, just as spell power was made to impact both healing and damaging spells in a single unified stat.  That means that the same hit rating you're using to up your melee hit chance is also upping your spell hit chance.   The chance to hit with spells is just inherently higher than the chance to miss with melee attacks.  Maybe there's something I'm misunderstanding about your question, though.<br>
<br>
As far as +hit's importance, it is absolutely vital to hit the melee cap as any melee class, and Death Knights are no exception...until you reach that cap, hit grants more DPS for its itemization value than any other stat in most cases.  As far as spell hit goes, it's still a boost to your overall damage to try and reach the cap, but not nearly as much so.<br>
<br>
EDIT:  The short version is that you personally with the gear I'm seeing right now on the armory would need to add 145 more Hit Rating to your gear to reach the 17% spell hit cap, just like the Be Imba page you're referring to says.  You should also really consider checking out the Dual Wield thread to see how to improve your spec, especially with things going on like your skipping Virulence which is a talent which directly addresses the issue at hand.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>You're right about the value of crit being lowered to KM-centric builds.  The exact value relative to other stats is TBD, but I wouldn't expect the value of crit to disappear.  As a 2-hander tank though, this is an amazing change that will restore frost as the superior tree for my tank style, and it will make Dark Conviction a far less useful talent for tanks.  I'll leave it to the DW pros to determine the precise drop in value of crit for DW'ers.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Blood 2H DPS is fine. Your trash dps is going to drop since your AoE isn't as good, but on bosses you might even see an improvement vs Unholy (I know I did). Also, that 10% AP buff is huge if no one is bringing it. Even if you see your own DPS stay the same or even drop slightly, you're contributing a huge buff to your melee. My own AP with Horn of Winter only is about 4300. It rises fast with raid buffs, and we have Fury warriors and Feral druids much higher than that. Abom's Might is adding an almost constant 400-500 AP to every one of your melees, vastly surpassing any damage you might lose from Unholy Blight or Gargoyle.<br>
<br>
I've been raiding as Blood since early December using 51/13/7, and I routinely place top 5, and often top 3 in the meters. On fights that are friendly to my cooldown length I compete with our Fury warriors for the top spot (Gluth is very friendly to us, for example).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Is the Ebon Plaguebringer bug bad enough to warrant a respec? I used to be the only Unholy DK in our raids, but recently  our Blood switched over and now we're both putting out Ebon Plaguebringer. WWS still has me in the top 5 DPS for most fights, but it annoys me to know that I could be better if it weren't for some stupid bug.<br>
<br>
Do you reccomend sticking with two Unholy DKs, or is it bad enough to warrant me changing to a Frost, Blood, or DW build? If so, do any of the alternative builds stand out, or are they close enough to let personal preference decide? From what I understand, 2H Unholy and DW are the strongest right now, but I really prefer 2H builds to DW. <br>
<br>
Right now we generally have 1-2 Frost DK tanks, so the Frost buffs are a given in our raids, but no Bloods, Enhance Shammies, or MM Hunters; so no one is putting out the Abomination's Might type buff. I could go that route, but if Blood 2H is significantly worse DPS I feel like I might be better off just sucking up the DPS loss from Ebon Bugbringer and staying Unholy 2H.<br>
<br>
I know one of us could spec into Crypt Fever, but since they're removing that option in 3.0.8 I don't really consider that a viable long term solution.</div>

Hmm stat wise, if we break everything down into ratings such as listed in the table above, <a id="itemlink" class="q4" style=" font-weight: bold;" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100810000932/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=40406" target="_blank">[Inevitable Defeat]</a> has a 44.0139 advantage over <a id="itemlink" class="q4" style=" font-weight: bold;" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100810000932/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=39758" target="_blank">[The Jawbone]</a> in terms of stats.  This is the equivalent of ~17.7 additional Str or ~7 higher base weapon DPS.<br>
<br>
However, we run into a snag in terms of weapon delay, and therefore average weapon damage, when calculating strike damage.  According to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100810000932/http://elitistjerks.com/f72/t37673-treatis_weapon_speed/p2/" target="_blank">A treatis on Weapon Speed</a>, 0.3 weapon speed roughly equals to 1% overall damage raid buffed.  Using that figure and multiply by 2/3 for the sake of expediency, we are looking at a 0.67% increase in damage for <a id="itemlink" class="q4" style=" font-weight: bold;" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100810000932/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=39758" target="_blank">[The Jawbone]</a>. Assuming 4400 DPS raid buffed, that comes out to be ~29.5 DPS.<br>
<br>
So, how does one reduce it further so the two can be compared? &gt;.&gt;<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I am not seeing where you read that. From what I had read in the thread, BCB is normalized, ergo faster weapon is better (procs). Slower weapons are for PvP (burst).<br>
<br>
<br>
Really, I do not think that there would be too much of a difference between the two, you would have to get a large amount of data off of Target Dummies to see any reliable difference.<br>
<br>
Edit: If you were to test on a target dummy, I would reduce your rotation as much as possible (no RP dumping, no IT, just PS, BS, and SS [without glyph]). Hell, I would even just spam SS (no glyph) if it weren't for the necessity of including BCB (which is questionable, because it is proc based, and thus subject to RNG, making an accurate data collection poor). <br>
<br>
I would try to limit the number of external variables as much as possible (no Runeforge, no external buffs).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

If you don't have problems with threat as is, no need to worry about it. If you are currently having threat issues, make sure you know about the bug that disables the % Threat Gains in Frost Presence after death. Just swap into blood and back again to clear it.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
Two potential raiding DKs.  One specced for Unholy tanking, other for Unholy DPS.  The DPS has as close to perfect attendance as can honestly be expected of a human being.  The tank's attendance will not be as high as the DPSers.  Both are good players who pull their weight in a raid.<br>
<br>
When running heroics I had the DPS yield the 3rd disease to the tank as much as he could and I noticed his DPS fell anywhere from 500-800 from what it normally is in said heroics with a warrior tank.  I do not want to create a situation where one of the better DPSers is losing a good chunk of his damage, and I also don't want to create a sitaution where the warlocks are without Ebon Plague and the raid is without Unholy Aura more than need be.<br>
<br>
My gut feeling is that the raider with the better attendance should probably be the Unholy representative, but I also realize that gut feelings sometimes get people into bad situations.<br>

I am not fully certain on the mechanics of Ebon Plague getting overwritten though, because I have had EP up on all mobs in an AoE, and when switching to a different target in that AoE, my FF and BP are up, but not EP.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Honestly, if I was that worried about it (which I usually am), I would just voluntarily respec as needed.  With dailies and stuff, respecs are much more affordable than before.  If you played a druid or warrior before, you'll probably be used to respec'ing frequently.<br>
<br>
While you go through the frequent respec'ing it's a good opportunity to try out various other specs and see for yourself which ones work for you.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
1127 strength unbuffed from my armory means a Fallen Crusader proc is worth 676 AP.<br>
<br>
Fallen Crusader uptime on the mainhand with 1.6 speed and 1 strike every 5 seconds (averaging out a rotation with 2x PS 2x BS in 20 seconds):<br>
<br>
p = ppm * 1 / swings per min = 1.2 / (60 / 1.6) = 3.2%<br>
d = 15<br>
v = autoswings per sec + strikes per sec = (1/1.6) + (1/5) = 0.825<br>
u = 1 - (1 - p)^dv = 33.12% uptime, times 676 is 223 average AP.<br>
<br>
Add in an offhand also with 1.6 speed and fallen crusader:<br>
<br>
v = (2/1.6) + (1/5) = 1.45<br>
u = 50.7% uptime, times 676 is 343 average AP, minus 223 is 120 AP gain from the offhand enchant.<br>
<br>
Berserking on the offhand instead:<br>
<br>
p = 3.2% as above, since berserking is also 1.2 PPM<br>
d = 15<br>
v = 1/1.6 = 0.625<br>
u = 26.3%, times 400 is 105 average AP.<br>
<br>
If I didn't screw anything up, the conclusion is clearly that berserking is worthless to us. Unless your gear is really really bad, and you don't get Kings, and you never summon your ghoul (who benefits from your STR, but not your AP). And if your gear is that bad, spend all the money on buying new gear instead of on mats for Berserking.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div class="intellitxt" id="post_message_1055231"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->General question.<br>
<br>
With our normal 25 man raid group, I am the only DK in the raid. I typically spec unholy with some variaition of the standard 17/0/54 spec. We virtually never have an enhancement shaman or a Marksman Hunter, but we do always have a Boomkin. This means that, at least on single targets, there is always the 13% magic damage buff but there is never the +10% AP or the 20% haste.<br>
<br>
I am considering a respec for the benefit of the raid (I'm typically on top of the meters as Unholy and while that is nice for the epeen, in general I don't care about that if the entire raid is doing considerably better) and am wondering if Improved Icy Talons or Abomination's Might would be the better overall buff for the raid. We run 8 melee types on average.<br>
<br>
I was thinking possibly something like the 31/39+1 DW build to gain Talons and keep Unholy Aura.<br>
<br>
Anyone have any suggestion on what would be the most beneficial in this situation and that wouldn't entirely gimp me in the process?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">You can't really put a DPS number on unholy aura because it's very dynamic. On fights like patchwerk it is pretty much useless (saves maybe half a second running to him on the pull), whereas on fights like heigan, 4hm and any other fights that requires movement its value increases. <br>
You kind of answered your own question already, because the variables are undefined, and they differ for every group.</div>

</div>They said they'll think about it, but I wouldn't expect changes anytime soon, it's the kind of stuff that takes time because it's not very high on the priority list, and requires graphical changes(which are more annoying than just stat tweaks). The only fight I can see it being an issue is Sartharion, just turn spell details to low, DnD doesn't display but you can still see voidzones. To be honest, if you're paying attention, you can see void zones inside DnD easily too.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I realize avoidance helps a great deal on Bone Shield, and is therefore valuable, and i assume this is not something easily considered;<br>

The issue here is that Grasscutter is offhand only, but is faster than Avool's. I don't particularly want to stop using Avool's sword, but do I really have a choice?

Essentially what I'd like to know is if I should go ahead with buying Grasscutter and have a faster weapon by .1 in my main hand and a slower weapon in my offhand, or if I should scrap the idea and try to find something else, perhaps buy <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090908223043/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=40684" target="_blank">Mirror of Truth</a> instead, because maybe its a DPS upgrade?

</div>The reason why you may have heard that the Blood Strike Glyph will work off of attack/casting speeds reductions is due to a change to the Mage talent Torment of the Weak. That talent, like the Blood Strike Glyph, only works on movement slowing effects on live but is being changed to work off of attack and movement speed effects as well. As such many have been wondering if, as a side effect, the Blood Strike Glyph will also be affected.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately there hasn't been any conclusive PTR testing to answer your question that I'm aware of, despite the fact that it's come up in the Blood DPS thread numerous times. <br>
<br>
However, depending on your raid make up it can still work regardless as some movement speed slowing abilities can be applied on bosses due to a secondary effect. FFB, Infectious Wounds and Desecration are the most common sources of such effects. If you have someone providing one of those debuffs you can actually benefit from the glyph on Live.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1060519"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Naerys: You seem to be extremely confused somewhere. Let me break it down simply:<br>
<br>
You want to attack as often as possible to proc Killing Machine as often as possible. This is so important that it's often worth it to go down 10+ DPS on a weapon in order to move from a slow (2.4-2.8) to a fast (1.5-1.6) weapon. Offhand hits versus mainhand hits are completely irrelevant; that is to say, you won't gain any KM procs by swapping your offhand with your mainhand.<br>
<br>
Now, since you would be going from a 1.5 + 2.7 to a 1.5 + 1.6 (again, order doesn't matter for KM), you would be gaining significantly in addition to the increase in weapon DPS.<br>
<br>
<br>
Note that this applies to this patch only. Next patch, speed becomes mostly irrelevant; just look for stats and DPS. Either way, Grasscutter is a solid upgrade. You might benefit more from Mirror though. You should also consider swapping your weapon hands, since your offhand is over 10 DPS higher than your mainhand, and offhand damage is halved. (Well, not quite halved with Nerves of Cold Steel, but still penalized.) Definitely swap if you don't have Frost Strike (cookie cutter DW build), but if you're messing around with a FS build, I'm not sure how the numbers stack up offhand.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1060553"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Kuro: Thanks for your quick response. I brought this up in my semi-serious raiding guild, and all I got was 'NO NEVER USE A FAST WEAPON IN MAIN HAND, ESPECIALLY IF YOUR OFFHAND IS SLOWER!' and I was put off because from reading through the threads on EJ, I figured it wouldn't be a problem. In any case, my build does have Frost Strike in it - going away from the theorycrafting norm to see how it turns out. So far, for the amount of low level gear I have, the DPS output is surprising. With a total of 4 low level items, 2 of them green, i'm doing about 1600-2.2k 5 man DPS depending on the group make up in heroics. It goes even higher in raids, and while that, by itself, is not an impressive number, just think what it will look like decked out in full epics.<br>
<br>
I'll keep experimenting with my strange build and see if there is a DPS threshold based on gear. Thanks again for your input, I'll be getting Grasscutter in 10 emblems and then saving up for my T7 gloves and Mirror of Truth.<br>
<br>
<br>

One concept that has a irked me since I started playing my death knight is the value of reaching the expertise cap. I've read a good amount of discussion on it, but i've yet to see a definitive decision or math to support it. Coming from a caster, I keep having the idea that expertise=melee hit, even though I know better. I recently came from a DW build to a 2h frost build. I am currently sitting at 17 expertise (one below my cap). Browsing through some of my recent WWS, Frost strike is 28% if my damage with oblit sitting close behind at 27%. Auto attacks come in at 22%.<br>
<br>
I guess my real question is: Is it worth gemming/enchanting/gearing for expertise up to the cap (especially with frost strike leading damage)?  Or is it just one of those stats that if gear has it, great, but don't try to stack it?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Speaking from personal experience, I found unholy to be excellent for 55-70, and blood to be superior from 70-80. Up to 70, your starting gear and relative power lets you AoE grind with unholy like a crazy person. Once you're in northrend, the mobs hit hard enough and live long enough that a heavy blood build for self-healing from blood worms and rune tap are pretty excellent. But that's not an empirical thing - I get the sense that all the builds are roughly equivalent for leveling.<br>
<br>
CAVEAT: that's assuming you're mainly soloing and DPSing if you're in a group. If you're tanking a lot, picking up blade barrier and toughness is a really good idea.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1066120"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Greetings,<br>
<br>
Cursed with a 26k connection speed at this time and wondering several things, I have seen people with similar gear and specs out damaging me by more then a small margin and wonder if it is my own rotations or my latency. I have sifted through piles of posts here but never quite find anything that helps with my particular scenario. <br>
<br>
Question:<br>
<br>
1. Will specs like the 32-39 be out of reach for someone with a 2-6k connection?<br>
<br>
2. Are there any specs more forgiving to someone who has sometimes extreme cast delays due to slow connection? <br>
     <br>
3. While I realise this site is geared towards raiding I wonder what sort of numbers a 0-44-27, 17-0-54, 51-0-20 specs will have in heroics or on the dummies. (I see numbers for these in raid but haven't found very much info concerning a 5 man group)<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I have no idea what a "26k" or "2-6k" connection is - dialup? I thought that would be 28.8k or 56k or one of those numbers. Or if you mean you ping between 2k to 6k, then it's hopeless; I've had the displeasure of attempting to play on a college network that got 1k-2k and on a satellite connection that ranged from 1k-4k and it's just not doable. If it's just dialup, you're probably no worse off than Aussies, who seem to manage quite well with normal rotations and the like.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I haven't paid too much attention to the situation because it's clearly suboptimal play, but search for Unholy Presence. I recall several mentions in various threads of people pulling reasonable DPS in UP, just a bit lower than BP. I'd think UP would allow for quite a bit more latency/reaction time error with many setups since there's so much dead time normally.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1067622"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I searched through the Blood thread and while looking at sample rotations for 51/0/20 saw numerous references to a rotation looking something like this:<br>
<br>
PS&gt;IT&gt;HS&gt;HS&gt;OB<br>
PS&gt;IT&gt;HS&gt;HS&gt;HS&gt;HS&gt;DC&gt;HS&gt;HS&gt;OB<br>
Repeat Line 2<br>
<br>
What I found odd while testing this is that the two blood runes needed for the last two HS in the second line would become active after the F/U from the PS/IT at the start of the line. So my basic question is, are people sitting on the F/U runes while putting in extra DC's in the space in order to cram more HS in before Obliting diseases off or am I missing something simple? Is it just that at that time there's no good use for those runes as they would either remove current diseases or reapply diseases that still have a reasonable duration thus pushing them back until they can be put to better use or is there something here I haven't considered?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

My apologies, let me clarify. By 26k I mean connection speed of 26kbps dial up connection and by 2-6k I mean ping times.

				<div style="font-style:italic">Greetings,<br>
Cursed with a 26k connection speed at this time and wondering several things, I have seen people with similar gear and specs out damaging me by more then a small margin and wonder if it is my own rotations or my latency. I have sifted through piles of posts here but never quite find anything that helps with my particular scenario. <br>
Question:<br>
1. Will specs like the 32-39 be out of reach for someone with a 2-6k connection?<br>
2. Are there any specs more forgiving to someone who has sometimes extreme cast delays due to slow connection? <br>
3. While I realise this site is geared towards raiding I wonder what sort of numbers a 0-44-27, 17-0-54, 51-0-20 specs will have in heroics or on the dummies. (I see numbers for these in raid but haven't found very much info concerning a 5 man group)<br>

</div>If you're referring to a very high latency playstyle, go 2h, deep unholy and use unholy presence - PS,IT,SS,UB.SS - SS,DC,SS,DC.SS will get you a fair chunk of normal latency dps while leaving room for a one *second* (1000 ms) average latency. If you're latency is higher than that, or varies rapidly, you're playing the wrong class - rogue and feral druid are the only ones that can eat so much latency and still dps effectively.<br>
<br>
If you need more information, pm me with more information about the range of your ping and I'll do some math for you. If you're referring to a modem speed, that number is unimportant to your dps, except that it implies your ping is probably higher than normal.<br>
<br>
Edit: There is no way to do proper dps with a consistent 2k ping. But I recognize that you still want to play the game - the highest dps for crazy ping like that is either 2h unholy like I said, or 2h frost (antiseptic rotation), also in Unholy presence. A mutilate rogue is the only class/spec that can operate anywhere near full dps with that kind of ping.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1067996"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Hey guys,<br>
in advance: Sorry for my bad english.<br>
I hope it's the right place to ask because I don't want to disturb all the theorycrafting in those "&lt;talenttree&gt; DK DPS" - threads.<br>
<br>
I do 10 mans as my guild is not big enough for 25 man, so my gear is mostly 10man and HC stuff. I visit some threads here like 3-4 times a day and i keep myself informed, but there is one thing I can't get to know. I wonder how much DPS i could do with my current gear in a 25man with just every possible raidbuff and flask/foodbuff for me and pet. I'd like to know a number I should shoot for. So some more information:<br>
<br>
Selfbuffed with Horn:<br>
<br>
AP: 3068<br>
Crit: 27,14%<br>
Meleehit: 9,18%<br>
Spellhit: 11,47%<br>
Exp: 15<br>
Weapons: MH: Maexxnas Femur (FC); OH: Grasscutter (CG)<br>
Trinkets: Loas Shadow, Mirror of Truth<br>
Icy Touch Sigil and Glyph, Ghul Glyph and Blood Strike Glyph<br>
PetAP: 2731<br>
PetAgi: 1011<br>
<br>
Rotation with 0/33/38: PS - IT - HB - BS - BS - DC - PS - IT - HB - IT - IT - DC<br>
<br>
I did 3,4k DPS on Patchwerk without Flask and AotD, with EP on mob, Heroism, Sunder, 5% Crit buff, AP Shout and MotW with Ghoul and a somehow non-optimal Garg use.<br>
<br>
<br>
I tried one of those spreadsheets, but I can't get it to work. Gotta try harder i suppose.<br>
<br>
<br>
I hope someone could help me out, I'd really appreciate it.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>As unholy:<br>
Death and Decay, IT PS Pestilence UB. That seems the highest potential for the initial runes. After this it depends on how long the pack lasts, another DnD with the IT/PS/Pest runes, and the first 3 runes probably on Scourge Strike+Bloodboil. As far as I can tell, any pull with more than 1 mob it's worth AEing. UB is better than Deathcoil if the mobs live 20s, even if it's just one, so obviously better if it's 2+. It's the same for tanking. There's no "guides" about AEing because there's not that many options anyway, and when you're AEing it's trivial stuff(trash).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1069137"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I've been asked a lot recently to tank the whelp and fire adds when trying Sartharion with 2 drakes up. I've been told I should be able to do this with my DPS gear in Frost Presence, however when the whelps spawn I drop like a fly if I try and tank them all in my DPS gear.<br>
<br>
I'm saving IBF for when they spawn and I'm trying to time it so Bone Shield isn't on cooldown and I can re-use it when the charges are gone.<br>
<br>
Is there something I'm doing wrong or is it likely a healer issue? Should I be wearing my tanking gear instead? Or is our strategy wrong and should one of our tanks be picking up the whelps/fire adds?<br>
<br>
Not sure how useful WMO reports are for this sort of thing, but here is a 10-man PuG where I was asked to tank the whelps/fire adds. First attempt was in DPS gear, the rest were in tanking gear.<br>

The problem is two-fold. Firstly you *will* get crit by the adds, there is no but, if or maybe. Secondly, the deathknight super-cooldowns are no longer Super™ with IBF based of your defense value and bone shield dropped down to 20% so even trying to temporarily use them to brute-force tanking the whelps won't work.<br>
I regularily tank the adds on our 3drake kills and it is a hairy business in full tank gear.<br>

What you observe is a level-based partial resist.  NOTHING can affect a level-based resist.  Spell penetration is 100% useless in all contexts bar PVP, and, for us, very probably even then.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Again, and I can't emphasise this enough, spell penetration is useless in PVE.  Period.  Ask any DPS caster.  Never gem for it, never gear for it, never enchant for it.  There is ALWAYS something better you can get.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>The short answer is that it depends on your build.<br>
<br>
Personally I use <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090228160950/http://www.wowarmory.com/character-talents.xml?r=Fenris&amp;n=Runes" target="_blank">this</a> build hence I try to use HB whenever the cooldown is up and Obliterate otherwise. It results in much better tps. One thing to note is that if you have an HB build then you should open with IT&gt;HB&gt;PS since PS can be parried and HB cannot.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">The short answer is that it depends on your build.<br>
<br>
Personally I use <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090228160950/http://www.wowarmory.com/character-talents.xml?r=Fenris&amp;n=Runes" target="_blank">this</a> build hence I try to use HB whenever the cooldown is up and Obliterate otherwise. It results in much better tps. One thing to note is that if you have an HB build then you should open with IT&gt;HB&gt;PS since PS can be parried and HB cannot.</div>

</div>I disagree with the previous poster who answered you.<br>
<br>
Tanking unholy is the easiest. Frost require "skill" or, better said, "timing".<br>
An example: HoS event is damn troublesome if you are frost. You need to time your HB and pestilence with the weaves of mobs, but you must grow treath on mobs too since your dps-es are going wild. And no matter how good you are, unless you are overgeared (and can kill every wave before the next one) there will be a time toward the end when you'll be unable to time your attacks with the weaves (since the next one spawns when you are still in combat with the previous one) and you'll start trying to get the mobs back while they run wild in the room (mind, it can be done, but you need a perfect knowledge of the encounter).<br>
You'll have the same problems when you don't know (or can't know) the timing of things. It's a limitation of us being a cd class, unholy on the other hand has UB and morbidity 3/3 which helps a lot solving those problems. Blood I never tried in aoe, but 3/3 morbidity has a sense in a blood tank spec so I guess it's a bit easier for blood than for frost.<br>
<br>
As frost I use d&amp;d only for opening, of course, since I need some initial aoe aggro in order to be able to spread diseases. The problem is that morbidity is a waste of points in such a spec, but without it you'll find that sometimes you either wait or you start a pull without d&amp;d, which means a HB "wasted" (no frost fever on target) to get the time to apply diseases and do pestilence. (I don't take morbidity anyway, but I do spend 1 point in the 11th tier talent in frost, it's good cc in 5man and it spread frost fever, which is good even in raids).<br>
<br>
If you do a lot of istances or play with a healer, level as unholy in order to maximize your aoe abilities. If you mostly solo, I don't know, when I leveled there was the old death strike glyph and it made things REALLY different (I aoe-ed packs of 8 mobs no problem - in solo and using pulls of 3 mobs to rec).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>An easy 2H Frost rotation is: IT OB OB BS (rotating the last BS / OB depending on whether BR or DR comes up first). This requires a DR to start the rotation. For Frost, IT hits hard enough to make replacing PS worthwhile.<br>
<br>
In 3.0.8, you also probably want to replace an OB with a HB whenever KM procs, or throw a FS in the middle. If you leave it to the end of each rotation, you might miss procs.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Single target tanking is easy, problems may arise in aoe tanking.<br>
Unholy roation for aoe is d&amp;d IT PS Pestilence UB at the beginning. You may put down 1 d&amp;d that is generating threat over time for you on evey mob in the area, and UB which does the same for every mob around you. And you recast d&amp;d every cd which means it's up 2/3 of the time. So you just need to run near adds, if they are away from the d&amp;d and you can aggro them all trough UB, than bring them on d&amp;d for easy aoe threat.<br>
<br>
As Frost your best tps in aoe is using HB. HB is a direct spell so it generates threat only on a precise istant. 3/3 Morbidity is an option, but it is "not needed" if you are good at playing frost and the points you save you can spend in blood to get more ap and/or 2h damage.<br>
The problems arise from adds that "join the party" when your d&amp;d is gone, and both pestilence and HB are on CD (or runes are). If they spread before you get your cd back it's gonna be troubles if they are more than 3 (Death grip, dark command and IT, than you have to start build a bit of threat on them or the healers will aggro them again). Once per minute I can use Hungering Cold and block the adds, spreading frost fever which means I get aggro on them and I can HB them soon for greater damage (aka threat). Once a minute is more than enough unless you run with noobs.<br>
Morbidity makes thing easier, though I have no way to compare the two frost solutions we are talking about aoe threat wise, I know I can hold aggro on aoe over dps that are much more geared than me, and I won on tps on an almost full t7.25 unholy tank (altough it was pre patch and there's no way for me to know if it was a matter of frost presence bug or if he was slacking). No doubt, on the other hand, my build generates more single target threat than one with 3/3 morbidity, which is means more dps from me during bosses and that dps with better gear can unleash a bit more of their dps<br>
<br>
So, in the end, without morbidity (may it or may it not be more tps than a build without), frost can do an excellent aoe work, it only asks for more skill/attention/timing/whatever and can unleash better tps/dps on bosses. Thus, I consider it unneeded in a serious frost build.<br>
And it seems the community agree, considering the 2 standard frost build (now in need of an update maybe) have no point in morbidity too (DK tanking thread, first post).<br>
<br>
<br>
Regardin the frost tank vs unholy tank matter, they are both capable tanks, and I can't tell which is better threat on single target or which has better survivability since many things changed with this patch. But I do not doubt they are both viable for endgame. Altough our friend is levelling and has a lot of HCs in fron of him before tanking naxx10 &amp; co. Which means it's mostly a matter of playstyle that should lead his choice.<br>

		<div id="post_message_1071798"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->If you talk about my example with the t7.25 unholy dk, as I said there could have been many factors. The point is we both were there tanking and I had aggro (which proves that I had more tps than him). I can't show proof of it, but there is no point in me trying to sell you a false story.<br>
<br>
Concerning the better threat on single target in a frost build that choose morbidity 3/3 over one that goes for ap/2h damage talents in blood, there's no need for math. It's self evident. If you have the same talents but for those 3 points, one build has X tps, the other one has the same tps but 3 points that will be spent in talents that give more ap and 2h damage and so more single target tps.<br>
EDIT: There's of course the assumption that the build with 3/3 morbidity wouldn't use d&amp;d for single target tanking too. Since it's an aoe ability it makes sense it provides less tps on single target than you could have by using single target skills. This, though, should be proved, but I think the single target unholy rotation is proof enough.<br>
As I said, aoe wise I can't say anything without proper testing or math.<br>
<br>
Which bring me to the point: what's the reason to ask for proof for something self evident or a proof about something that could have been caused by a well known bug or by slacking? (it would have made sense to ask for proof if I had talked in general about frost aoe tps vs unholy aoe tps, but mine was an isolated example)<br>

</div>Because that is the point of these forums, multiple posts recently have been stating 'Here is my spec, I am doing 3.4kTPS on Ebon Hold dummy, my rotation is 'Blah' and I think I do better ae threat than I did when I was unholy' <br>

These posts are pointless assertions based on 'looking' at something.

</div>I don't really see how recount or other similar information can prove anything really. I'm not even sure what you're arguing about either. I haven't used unholy since the patch, but even with the DnD nerf, I'd expect AE threat to be fine. It is easier to use than frost, mostly because once it's started, most of it is automatic, but the initial application is probably just as hard. You drop DnD, IT&gt;PS one mob, pestilence them then pop UB. At that point, wandering plague, ub, dnd and disease ticks do the work for you, and you don't really need to target anything. You just respread disease/reapply dnd if needed.<br>
<br>
As frost, the pull is just as annoying, but you do need to keep spreading frost fever and pressing howling blast everytime it's up. However the initial burst of frost is generally higher because it happens sooner. DnD, IT Pestilence Bloodtap HB. You don't have to plaguestrike, saving one GCD, and HB burst threat all at once. You do need Bloodtap up to be able to lay down the DnD however, but you can do it without any DnD, and cast it later for sustained threat. You can deathchill if the pack is important for guaranteed high threat burst, and randomly you'll get procs helping(rime will let you dnd even without bloodtap, km will guarantee the crit on hb).<br>
<br>
With that said, in my experience(unholy prepatch and frost now), AE threat is still a non issue. People start AEing pretty much asap, and I still hold aggro on packs fine with either. So most of the discussion is moot.<br>
<br>
As for morbidity, you have 2 spare points in a typical frost builds. Those 2points can easily go in morbidity for trash pulls(it's still 5secs more than a full morbidity, but viable nonetheless). Your other options are single threat mechanics, so it's a matter of taste. But it's not impossible, or hard, to get morbidity in a frost build, you're not sacrificing vital talents for it. With that said, I can do fine without it as frost, when it's pretty much necessary as unholy or blood.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>The biggest unholy advantages are Pale Horse(mount speed) and Unholy Aura(run speed). You could enchant your boots to mitigate unholy aura, but you'd still ride your mount slower between various quest spots. Other than that however, frost would be fine for leveling, it won't be that much slower. One other issue that may rise is the lack of self healing, frost is the worst healing tree, so you might have to slow down on AEing and/or chaining mobs to death strike more. But if I had to compare frost to other classes, it's still very good. It's not the best of the best, but it's much better than lvling as a healing spec, or some of the normal specs too for other classes.<br>
<br>
You could just run instances as unholy though, and level as unholy.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Haste only increases your white damage (+ associated talents). The problem is that white dmg is only ~25% of your dmg.<br>
<br>
So Haste only increases 25% of your damage while things like Strength, hit, crit, weapon dmg and such increase 100% or nearly 100% of your damage<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1073301"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Haste affects the GCD when you use "spell" abilities, when you use "physical" abilities, it doesn't affect it.<br>
<br>
So if you have enough haste to reduce the GCD to 1 second and you cast Fire Blast than your GCD is 1 second. If you use Mortal Strike than it's still 1.5 seconds.<br>
<br>
As far as I know DKs have both "spell" and physical abilities, so haste should affect them differently. Plus it affects the weapon swinging speed.<br>
<br>
It's a bit long answer, but I wasn't sure to have correctly understood what you wanted to know, so I just wrote down it all.<br>

</div>You answered your own question when you asked him, really.<br>
<br>
The <i>sole </i>purpose of Defense for DKs is to become uncrittable. The +Dodge/Parry are icing on the cake. Gem/enchant for threat and survivability after you hit 540.<br>
<br>
<br>
Question: How does a heavy Unholy DPS tri-spec fare? Something along the lines of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090916164645/http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/classes/deathknight/talents.html?tal=2305000030000000000000000003200505030000000000000000000231202035103115203100203000000" target="_blank">this</a>. I know it looks weird, but Nec and BCB only go well with IT, really. Give it a shot, or stick to a cookie-cutter Unholy DPS build?<br>
<br>
Oh, and another question. Unholy AoE grinding - Blood or Frost pres? Unholy Presence is borderline useless, but I guess it'd go well with the above-mentioned build (which sadly has almost 0 AoE utility).<br>

Oh, and another question. Unholy AoE grinding - Blood or Frost pres? Unholy Presence is borderline useless, but I guess it'd go well with the above-mentioned build (which sadly has almost 0 AoE utility).<br>
<br>
Edit: forgot to ask my question.</div>

</div>I don't understand what you are trying to do with this spec. If you are raiding, Crypt Fever would be useless (assuming you'd have an EP DK already in the raid, which you should). Obliterate is a fairly weak ability when it doesn't have its' buffing talents (Merciless Combat, Rime, Guile of Gorefiend, Tundra Stalker; alternately Might of Mograine, Blood Gorged) and with that spec you'd have to use it as your primary nuke. I'd stick strictly to Scourge Strike for any deep Unholy spec, if you want to Obliterate a Frost spec would benefit you much more (and more so than a Blood spec which is pretty average DPS at the moment).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

The <i>sole </i>purpose of Defense for DKs is to become uncrittable. The +Dodge/Parry are icing on the cake. Gem/enchant for threat and survivability after you hit 540.</div>

</div><br>
You couldn't be more wrong? Given that defense is barely below dodge in terms of avoidance, and IBF scales with defense, taking defense past 540 is not at all a bad thing.<br>
<br>
There's no reason to demand a hard value above 540 (such as the 600 the previous poster had mentioned) but saying that the sole purpose of defense is uncrittability is plain misinformation.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Having 541 Defense puts your IBF at 41% and it scales pretty nicely from there, but it is (at best) an 18 second cooldown every minute.

</div>Yes, in a gem situation X dodge &gt; X defense. The problem is morons running around with misinformation about defense being useless after 540. 20 defense is superior to 10 dodge on an item in real world situations.<br>
<br>
Also, trivialising IBF is kind of ridiculous. Let's assume the worst case 12 second duration<br>
<br>
Scenario A: You use it whenever it's up over a long fight. 20% of the bonus damage mitigated counts toward your overall mitigation over the course of the fight. E.G. Increasing your IBF mitigation by 5% is roughly equivalent to increasing your overall mitigation 1%. (I have a feeling I'm slightly off on that, but it's close enough to prove my point)<br>
<br>
Scenario B: You're saving IBF for a large known spike, or as an "oh shit" button. Well, if it's being relied to pull duty to reduce an abnormally threatening spike, chances the bonus mitigation is *really* useful. Now I know it's not backed up by the theory re: Scenario A, but saying that increasing the power of your oh shit button is trivial seems to be a bit of a ridiculous assertion.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
What I find truly bizarre about this is that I can remember a year ago when people were complaining that relying on avoidance was too streaky/unpredictable. Now people are saying that a 1/5th uptime damage reduction is so unpredictable as to not be worth considering? I'm not advocating stacking defense, I'm just saying that it is consistently underrated in situations where you don't have perfect choice in how you're itemizing the points (not gems, basically.)<br>
<br>
Assuming constant use of IBF @ 12 seconds, and the rather debatable assumption that 1% avoidance roughly equals 1% mitigation in usefulness (thus 1% IBF bonus = .2% avoidance), I'm curious about what the relative worth of defense is for DKs vs. Dodge.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I was making an example of how taking a superior dodge item over stacking defence past cap gives a bigger permanent advantage, I brought IBF in to magnify the point.  <br>

First, while Last Laugh will have superior DPS and comparable ap/hit to most other 1H weapons, it will lack other stats (crit, expertise, armor pen, haste) where it has invested ilvl in defensive stats(defense, parry, and extra stam, in this case).  Since white/weapon damage is such a small part of a DK's DPS when compared to other melee classes, it further "devalues" it.  Finally, you probably want a slow MH nowadays for extra strike damage since you lose nothing in terms of KM/BCB/Necrosis, which further devalues Last Laugh because in the OH slot it's high dps is only worth 65%, while still offering sub-par stats.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I am a 32/39 DW DK and was wondering about gems.  Do I go +32 to Attack power or +12 To Strength.  Thats about it nothing to hard. <br>
<br>
 Because of Elitist Jerks I have learned alot, and have been #1 my guilds ten man runz.  But still need to understand what GCD means and until recently I had no idea what to do to rune dump.  Currently I do about 2.1K in five man H and about 3.5K on patchwork. Nothing to spectacular at this time.  <br>

 Thanks for any comments.. rude or otherwise... haha... peace ... I am off to Naxx again..</div>

</div>Of course 20 Def is superior to 10 Dodge. Edit: Apparently, 10 Def is too!<br>
<br>
I never claimed it's useless, I meant it's not necessary past 540. A PuG is not more likely to get a 560 def DK than a 541 one. Also, notice how I said Gem/enchant?<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Assuming constant use of IBF @ 12 seconds, and the rather debatable assumption that 1% avoidance roughly equals 1% mitigation in usefulness (thus 1% IBF bonus = .2% avoidance), I'm curious about what the relative worth of defense is for DKs vs. Dodge.</div>

</div>Napkin math time.<br>
<br>
From what I recall, at 540D it's 35%. Let's assume at 600 it's 40%.<br>
<br>
60 Defense (~300 Defense rating) equates to an extra 2.4% Dodge and 2.4% Parry, a 2.4% chance to be missed and it reduces the amount of damage you take via IBF by 5% one fifth of the time (w/o glyph), so by 1% over a longer period of time.<br>
<br>
You need 40 Dodge rating for 1% Dodge, so 300 dodge rating = 7.5% Dodge, which is less useful than 2.4% Dodge, 2.4% Parry, 2.4% chance to be missed and 1% damage reduction, if only slightly.<br>
<br>
In conclusion, gemming for Defense is better than gemming for D/P, even if the numbers for IDF's reduction portion that is based on Defense are off, partially because IDF reduces all incoming damage, not just physical, by 1%.<br>

You should definitely have both the other raid buffs in some form, at the moment they may be brought by an enhancement shaman, but having a DK provide them instead will likely increase the damage of the shaman as they can thus take more beneficial talents. One idea may be to have one of them switch to tanking and have a warrior/paladin/druid dps, though that depends entirely on your raid group.<br>

<br>
Anybody else noticed a DPS drop on pure DPS fights such as Patchwerk?<br>
Before the gargoyle nerf patch when I popped AotD I managed 5.2k DPS but when we went there last reset I only managed 4.3k, and I did the same rotations, timed gargoyle correctly (when my AP was at 7400 when Crusader/Mirror of truth etc procced.), but still I got a bit sad about the numbers.<br>
<br>
Also it seemed that my Scourge Strike hit for a lot less than before, but this might just be me looking wrong, quite sure it used to crit at least for 8k on Patchwerk but this time around it usualy critted 6.7k-7.3k (and I have the aweareness glyph.).<br>
<br>
It might've been because our overall DPS was lower (compare 2 min 50 seconds kill to 3 min 30 seconds) and the fight before pre-patch everyone was over 4000 but this time standard was 3.8-4.2k, but I just wanna hear with you guys first before I run out screaming "Our single target DPS has been nerfed by 1k".<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I believe it's already been concluded that the dps loss from having two UH DKs in raid is not quite as severe as everyone thought. If you want a more thorough explanation on that you can search through the UH thread.<br>
<br>
As for the question of what to do with that many DKs in a raid, I'll agree that they certainly shouldn't all be specced UH and you should take steps to make sure you're supplying yourself with all the necessary raid buffs. Problems with single target dps would probably have less to do with them all being UH and more to do with player error as the EP bug alone shouldn't drop them all to the bottom of the meter. Switching specs won't necessarily increase their dps as UH is still quite strong (if not the strongest) 2H dps spec, so you might want to make sure that they are properly speccing/glyphing and using optimal rotations/priorities.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>You would want a Hailstorm OH in this setup, in order to maximize BCB mainhand procs. However, the best DK OH right now is actually <a id="itemlink" class="q4" style=" font-weight: bold;" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101110192204/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=40402" target="_blank">[Last Laugh]</a>, due to the higher DPS and strength.<br>
<br>
[e]: kurokaze is indeed correct, I had done some testing earlier that seemed to indicate otherwise but looking over my numbers again, I see that BCB procs both OH and MH swings. However, since Cinderglaicer is a percentage, not a PPM (with I think a 5% proc chance), it is still better to use a fast offhand while dual wielding.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1079529 intelliTXT"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I had a question about Blood Worms.<br>
<br>
I read the Blood thread and would have never thought about spec'ing into them until I saw some discussion about them helping to maintain over 75% health to keep that increase in damage.<br>
<br>
Question is, from the early days of the expansion, I have heard that Blood Worms cause more problems then they're worth for raiding.  IE they run off and attack other targets and that they can soak up heals and such.  With that in mind I had a Blood spec in mind that excluded them, however upon reading the Blood thread I saw several people state that they no longer go off and attack mobs and such and that since they actually damage a mob it's a DPS increase while healing you.  But what about the heal bit?  Are Blood Worms still a "no go" for a raiding spec?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I believe it's already been concluded that the dps loss from having two UH DKs in raid is not quite as severe as everyone thought. If you want a more thorough explanation on that you can search through the UH thread.<br>
<br>
As for the question of what to do with that many DKs in a raid, I'll agree that they certainly shouldn't all be specced UH and you should take steps to make sure you're supplying yourself with all the necessary raid buffs. Problems with single target dps would probably have less to do with them all being UH and more to do with player error as the EP bug alone shouldn't drop them all to the bottom of the meter. Switching specs won't necessarily increase their dps as UH is still quite strong (if not the strongest) 2H dps spec, so you might want to make sure that they are properly speccing/glyphing and using optimal rotations/priorities.</div>

</div>I believe he said 5-7 EPB DKs (yay reading comprehension?). And the DPS loss from having 7 people bring the same non-stacking buff is high enough to warrant a change. Or are you trying to say that having 2 Blood, 1 IIT and 1 EPB DKs would not result in a net raid DPS increase over having 4 EPB ones?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>You're very much entitled to your opinion. I still think it's better to have two Blood DKs MoB'ing to help the tank out (especially if it's a warrior), and one Frosty to help the Shammy clear those points up for other talents. I would never, ever take 7 EPB DKs on a raid. 3 I could live with, but those 3 points are still useless for 2 of them if it's a regular raid makeup. I think we can agree that their DKs are doing something very, very wrong though.<br>

		<div id="post_message_1081156 intelliTXT" style="min-height: 183px;"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I started a DK as an alt of mine and am close to reaching 80 so now begins my planning on what to spec once I hit 80. I have narrowed it down to 2 (or 3) specs and would like some advice on which to go with. I have chosen either:<br>
<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101109012122/http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/classes/deathknight/talents.html?tal=2305020530003313201251013510000000000000000000000000000230210305003100000000000000000" target="_blank">50/0/20 +1</a><br>
This can actually be 50/0/21 or 51/0/21. Dancing Runic Weapon vs. Summon Gargoyle. Which is more DPS?<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101109012122/http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=jfVMqh0IsbRxzAoG0x0hZfM" target="_blank">51/13/7</a><br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101109012122/http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=jfVMVZZfMbhxckgcoMfsut" target="_blank">17/0/54</a><br>
<br>
     Now I know deep blood 2H or DW 32/39 will produce much better results but I have heard they are more gear dependant and as a fresh 80 who won't be raiding much I doubt I'll attain the gear to make those specs a viable choice. So would I better off going Unholy (170/54) or one of the other ones? <br>
<br>
Secondly as for glyphs I was going to go with:<br>
<br>
<font color="YellowGreen"><b>Unholy:</b></font><br>
Major - Glyph of the Ghoul, Glyph of Scourge Strike, Glyph of Icy Touch<br>
Minor - Glyph of Pestilence, Glyph of Horn of Winter, Glyph of Raise Dead<br>
<br>
<font color="Red"><b>Blood:</b></font><br>
Major - Glyph of Ghoul, Glyph of Obliterate, and either <b>***Glyph of Icy Touch or Blood Strike</b><br>
Minor - Glyph of Pestilence, Glyph of Horn of Winter, Glyph of Raise Dead<br>
<br>
<b>***</b> For the major blood glyphs I notice people choosing either IT or BS. Now my question is why? In all the rotations I've seen, read and used none of them include Blood Strike so how does that exactly benefit a blood DK? <br>
<br>
Lastly the rotations (if you can call them that) I've been looking at are as follows:<br>
<br>
<b><font color="Red">Blood:</font></b><br>
Plague Strike -&gt; Icy Touch -&gt; Heart Strike 2x -&gt; Obliterate -&gt; Death Coil until RP is depleted -&gt; Plague Strike -&gt; Icy Touch -&gt; Heart Strike 4x -&gt; Death Coil until RP is depleted<br>
<br>
<b><font color="YellowGreen">Unholy:</font></b><br>
Plague Strike -&gt; Icy Touch -&gt; Blood Strike 2x -&gt; Scourge Strike -&gt; Unholy Blight -&gt; Scourge Strike 3x -&gt; Death Coil until RP is depleted<br>
<br>
Sorry if these are noobish questions or not but the WoW forums are useless the majority of the time and this is the "simple questions/simple answers" thread. Thanks in advance.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
Should I concern myself with death strike in 10 and 25 man content, it has a self heal but competes with howling blast and obliterate for threat generation.<br>
<br>
I notice in frost dps rotations, plague strike is often left out. Should I also leave it out of frost tanking rotations in favor of the extra howling blast or obliterate? (specifically is it better threat to pestilence the plague strike dot, or howling blast / oblit)<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Despite the new tooltip, the glyph of Death Strike still appears to benefits from runic power for the amount of heal it gives. I find it so to be still very useful for helping me being above 75% health for fights like Thaddius or Sapphiron for instance.<br>
Since the patch, I realized I almost never use Pestilence anymore, because trash mobs are dying very very quickly : I'd rather spam Heart Strike (I even don't use IT and PS, just DnD, HS and Obliterate). So, I found the pestilence glyph to be not that useful for us (blook DK)  anymore.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
     2-is this talent strickly to benefit other members of a group and the occasional DC (assuming disease damage is not concidered magic and does benefit from the 10% damage of crypt fever but not the aditional damage from ebon plague)?<br>
<br>
     3-is it worth it to pick up Outbreak for the 45% increase in BB damage concidering it creates a death rune and is increased another 13% by the ebon plague(level from 70-80 and do a lot of aoe grinding/questing)?<br>

Note: i saw this same question earlier in the forums, but it was skipped in favor of the more readily known questions the same person asked. and was unable to find anything on the UH DPS thread. a list of DK "abilities" that would be effected by EP would be phenomenal. <br>

</div>Actually, that's wrong. Defense gives better avoidance per point... the thing is Defense is already hit by diminishing returns when you're stacking 600 odd rating to get uncrittable. The amount of dodge rating needed for defense to overtake it @ 540 defense is lower than 1000 rating anyway. IIRC around a 3:2 ration of defense rating to dodge rating was close to ideal for maximizing just avoidance.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

@zeheres: the glyph works with HS (or did as of 3.0.3), as stated in the comments section on the page that you linked, and any debuff that reduces movement speed of the target triggers the extra damage (including Desecration).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div class="intellitxt" id="post_message_1082935"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I have a question about diseases and how the damage is calculated.  The tooltip clearly shows the damage per tick and based off that data, we get the 0.055 coefficient for AP.  A simple example:<br>
<br>
A level 79 character has 2410 AP.  He has Bone Armor, full Ebon Plaguebringer, Rage of Rivendare.  He's also specced for Black Ice and Desecration.  He also is in Blood Presence.  He attacks a level 80 dummy.  PS -&gt; IT -&gt; BB -&gt; BB and lets the diseases expire.<br>
<br>
He gets these results:<br>
Blood Plague ticks: 339<br>
Frost Fever ticks:  494<br>
<br>
According to the tooltip,<br>
<br>
Blood Plague: 30.7 + 133 bonus damage from AP<br>
Frost Fever: 25.3 + 133 bonus damage from AP<br>
<br>
Now how does 163.7 get to be 339 and 158.3 become 494?<br>
<br>
I tried this first:<br>
<br>
163.7 * (1.3 * 1.15 * 1.13 * 1.1 * 1.05 * 1.02) but the result was 325.7995 for Blood Plague.<br>
<br>
158.3 * (1.3 * 1.3 * 1.15 * 1.13 * 1.1 * 1.05 * 1.02) but the result was 409.568 for Frost Fever.<br>
<br>
The in-game numbers are just higher than any calculations I try.  No debuffs on the dummy.  No one was around.<br>
<br>
So what am I doing wrong on my calculations?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>You are probably missing Impurity (1.25 multiplier to bonus damage from AP). So we get the following:<br>
<br>
Blood Plague: (30.7 + 2410 * 0.055 * 1.25) * (1.3 * 1.1 * 1.13 * 1.05 * 1.02 * 1.15) ~= 391<br>
Frost Fever: (25.3 + 2410 * 0.055 * 1.25) * (1.3 * 1.1 * 1.13 * 1.05 * 1.02 * 1.15) * 1.3 ~= 494<br>
<br>
Frost Fever tallies with your in-game results, but Blood Plague doesn't. Playing around with the numbers a little, if you omit the multipliers for Desecration and Rage of Rivendare, you net a calculated value of ~338 for BP, which is closer to what you actually see.<br>
<br>
My best guess is that RoR and Desecration are not contributing to your initial PS/BP ticks since the 'conditions' for both to be applied do not actually happen until after your BP tick is locked in. This result is not totally unexpected since shadow priest dots work in a similar fashion (SWP not gaining the 10% from shadow weaving if applied before the shadow weaving buff is stacked fully). It could be tested further by re-applying EP and checking to see if the ticks are now of the expected 391 size. However, it is interesting that Ebon Plague's +13% spell damage and +30% disease damage do not work in the same way - I suspect that it's because EP is a debuff, but desecration (and shadow weaving) is a buff.<br>
<br>
I'm not specced into Desecrate/RoR, but I went to test Tundra Stalker and IT/FF in a similar fashion. The first time I applied FF, the size of my tick was 257. However, when I re-cast IT before the old FF expired, the new FF ticked for 284. When I hit PS before IT, the BP tick size was 205, and this did not change even after FF went up, until BP was reapplied, after which it was the correct 226.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
At current gear levels dodge is better than defence once you are crit immune, and you should <b>not</b> gem for defence instead of dodge.  You appear to be quoting from some outdated numbers meant for warriors, not DKs.  Warriors get more avoidance per point of defence than we do, and the miss cap is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100810000929/http://elitistjerks.com/1053037-post335.html" target="_blank">currently estimated at 16%</a>.  The combination of these factors make defence far weaker than you seem to think it is.<br>
<br>
Or if you'd like an example:  Glancing around the Armory, and making allowances for raid buffs, a DK in top epics right now might have, oh...  689 defence rating on gear (enough to be crit immune), 1200 strength, 300 agility, 350 dodge rating on gear, and 350 parry rating on gear.  Now that will vary a fair bit raid buffs, spec, gear choices, etc., but it hardly matters - plug those numbers into the DR formula and the comparison isn't even close - with those numbers dodge rating is 23% better.<br>
<br>
For defence to win, you'd need something like 1200 strength, 300 agility, 780 dodge rating, 0 parry rating.  That sounds great, until you realize that the gear needed simply doesn't exist.  And Ulduar gear, when added, will have even more strength, pushing the target dodge rating back even further.  If you could get tanking plate with agility instead of strength it might be feasible - except you wouldn't really want to use gear like that, even if it existed, which it thankfully doesn't.<br>
<br>
<b>In short:  Gem dodge, not defence.</b>  It doesn't matter what gear you have, once you are crit immune the marginal benefits of dodge rating exceed that of defence rating.  Whenever you have a choice go for dodge.<br>
<br>
<br>
Edit:  This post is talking about pure avoidance and ignoring IBF.  In retrospect, that seems like a silly thing to do.  Please refer to my <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100810000929/http://elitistjerks.com/1084850-post990.html" target="_blank">later post</a> for an explanation of why defence actually is better than dodge once you include IBF.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
<br>
I'm sitting at 31.1K life unbuffed<br>
(Using HoW) <br>
28.32% dodge<br>
21.51% parry (without blade barrier up)<br>
<br>
basically my question to the stats i posted above, since +Hit Rating is an issue for DWing, i keep getting told to of course get more Hit Rating, should i be replacing any of my dodge gems, etc on +hit/exp (at 5% exp anyways)? <br>
<br>
2nd question, do i NEED 541def if i also have the Sigil that grants more def rating, or can i drop some def rating (For example, my belt has 2x 16def gems) which i could xchange for hit and help my hit rating and threat generation?<br>
<br>
3rd question (sorry...have had these questions for awhile...)<br>
Since my parry is at 21.51%, should i runeforge my Mainhand with maybe... [ Rune of the Fallen Crusader ] i ask this because i figured if i gain str, str gives me parry anyways, and I'd possibly gain threat since I will be hitting harder?<br>
<br>
If this is the wrong section, plz let me kno and I'll post in the correct section (New to forums)<br>
<br>
Thank you.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I believe you are incorrect on almost all counts.  I don't know why you would care whether gemming for defense is better if you have 0 defense rating, since you're obviously not a tank in that case.  You are just arguing semantics, which is silly in itself, but you are also flat out wrong.<br>
<br>
1) Even at 1 defense rating, Dodge is still worth more per point until Defense until 104 dodge rating (with 1 agility, 1 strength, 1 parry rating as well, since this is a hypothetical argument).<br>
2) At <b>any reasonable gear level</b>, that is, 689 defense rating, Dodge is better than Defense until 732 Dodge rating.  But, this isn't really reasonable gear.  It's still gear with 1 Agility, 1 Strength, and 1 parry.<br>
3) At an actualy reasonable gear level, for example 1000 strength, 100 agility, 200 parry rating, Dodge is better than Defense until 1108 Dodge Rating.  This will vary, more strength will make Defense worse, more agility will make Dodge and Defense both worse, etc.<br>
4) The point on which you are entirely, stupidly wrong, is "In an utter vacuum, ignoring the effect on crits, Defense is still better for avoidance."  Not only is it not better in a vaccuum (no gear), it is not better at <b>any reasonable gear level currently available.</b><br>
5) The one point on which you are right is that this does not dictate gemming choices.  Just because Dodge gives you more avoidance does not make it better.  You may value overall damage taken (TTL), or Effective Health, or you may require a certain percentage impact on IBF.  All of these are good reasons to consider gemming with Defense (or stam, etc.)<br>
<br>
It is unfortunate that we're having this discussion in the simple question thread.  To remedy that:<br>
<br>
<b>Q:</b> What should I gem for when I am concerned with survivability?<br>
<b>A:</b> It depends.  Until gear changes significantly from that currently available: If you want to maximize avoidance, gem for dodge.  If you want to buff IBF while getting good avoidance, gem defense.  If you want to maximize Effective Health, gem stamina.  Never ever gem parry.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I already said that Dodge will give better avoidance returns than defense at real world gear levels. What you said was "Dodge gives more avoidance per point/item budget than defense, until you have upwards of 1000 dodge rating." That was the only thing I was taking issue with. Now that we've both made it clear how that statement should be taken, that part of it should be done with.<br>

</div>The impact on IBF is a valid point, and easy to miss if you look purely at avoidance (as, I admit, I did in my last post).  Looking at the math, if you assume that 1% increased reduction on IBF is just as good as 0.20% avoidance, then that's enough to make defence better across the board.  That's a big leap, but it seems plausible - and if anything I'd think that would be the baseline, since it assumes that you don't have the talent, that all incoming damage is physical, and that you have no ability to time IBF to coincide with a large spike.<br>
<br>
At the gear levels discussed earlier - 698 defence rating, 1200 strength, 300 agility, 350 dodge rating, 350 parry rating - then dodge rating is 23.02% stronger than defence rating in terms of avoidance.  If you calculate the mitigation from IBF using the above assumptions and treat it as if it was avoidance, then dodge is 13.50% weaker than defence rating.  (I'm using a scaling value of 0.15% reduction per point of defence skill, as found in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100810000929/http://elitistjerks.com/f72/t42539-death_knight_faq_read_before_posting/" target="_blank">the DK FAQ</a>.)  Playing with the model, that result is just as resilient to gear decisions as the result was when ignoring IBF.  A gear set otherwise identical to the above assumptions but with 1048 defence rating and 0 dodge rating would make dodge stronger - but you couldn't possibly assemble such a set, and anything less wouldn't be enough.<br>
<br>
<br>
All that being said, just so long as we're talking purely about <i>avoidance</i>, you're still quite wrong, as the math at Tankspot shows.  The discussion <i>was</i> about current gear, dodge <i>is</i> better until over 1k dodge rating (which you couldn't possibly obtain), and "in an utter vacuum", defence is <i>still</i> worse than dodge for avoidance.  It's worse with no DR (i.e., naked), and it's even worse with the DR that actually applies (i.e., while wearing your tanking gear).  And a few minutes playing with Wowhead indicates that it's also worse with any possible, viable set of gear currently in game, or which is likely to ever be in game.  Everything you've said is wrong; dodge is simply more avoidance.  You can speculate on what would happen if Bliz added a new runeforge enchant with 800 dodge rating on it if you like, but you could speculate on what would happen if they changed the rating conversion formulas too.  Neither is going to happen, and without one of those, dodge is the best choice for pure avoidance now and for the forseeable future.<br>
<br>
However, once you include IBF scaling, it's hard to see how you can avoid the conclusion that defence wins.  You'd have to assume that 1% increased damage reduction on IBF was worth only 0.11% avoidance for dodge to still win.  Or to put it another way, IBF would have to be up for only 11% of all incoming damage - when just hitting the button every cooldown should average 20%, worst case.  Unless I'm missing something basic, I don't see how dodge can still win.<br>
<br>
<b>Revised conclusion:</b>  Gem for defence instead of dodge given a choice.  It's always less avoidance, but IBF more than makes up for it.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100810000929im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":)" class="inlineimg">  (Whether you should even be trying to decide between gemming for dodge or defence in the first place is, of course, an entirely separate question.)<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div class="intellitxt" id="post_message_1084956"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I have been cooking up a hypothesis on an alternate way of calculating the DK stat weights on how they affect DPS. My goal is to get some insight on how viable this new method would be.<br>
<br>
Let's say one was to take <b>all</b> the significant stats a DK has and statistically model them on how they will affect output DPS.<br>
<br>
<b>1) Strength<br>
2) Attack Power<br>
3) Critical Hit Rating<br>
4) Agility<br>
5) Armor Penetration Rating<br>
6) Haste Rating<br>
7) Weapon DPS</b><br>
<br>
Once gathered, could you use all these as predictors in a logistic regression to determine an outcome variable, namely DPS?<br>
<br>
I propose collecting multiple <b>sustained</b> DPS parses, then separating each predictor into 5 different dichotomous bands (0 if the DPS predictor does not fall in the range, 1 if it does).<br>
<br>
Once each predictor is defined by one of these bands, we could then place them in a regression to model the continuous variable, DPS.<br>
<br>
A model summary would generate respective beta coefficients for each of the prediction variables. The relative weight for each predictor would be the individual standardized beta coefficient divided by the sum of all the beta coefficients.<br>
<br>
<b>Areas of concern with this method:</b><br>
<br>
1) I'm not quite sure what type of regression model I should use. I initially thought I could use a binary logistic regression, but since DPS is a continuous variable, would a linear regression be better suited?<br>
<br>
2) Data collection. The DPS parses would all have to be under the same conditions. Perhaps a target dummy?<br>
<br>
Any feedback would be appreciated. I have been using the commonly accepted stat weights up to this point, and will continue to do so. I'm just wondering if there are alternative ways to look at the core of our DPS.<br>
<br>

		<div class="intellitxt" id="post_message_1084987"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Ok, I need help.<br>
<br>
Ive been using a 2h frost build 21/50 with a Titansteel destroyed, and as my gear has improved ive been seeing great numbers using the plaguestrike-less rotation.<br>
<br>
TAP<br>
&gt;IT&gt;BS&gt;FS&gt;OB&gt;FS&gt;OB&gt;DMP<br>
<br>
Today thought, I got hold of a Hatestrike and went and bought a Grasscutter with saved up badges. I use frost since I raid with a 2h 17/0/54 DK, and I have heard good things about 0/44/27 DW build, so I went, found the spec, hit the dummy and sadface. <br>
<br>
I know the limitations of using a dummy. I know the dps results arent as authentic as a raid environment, but using it as a control to compare 2 specs shouldnt be overly problematic. I also have read that if anything, it should BENEFIT the dw spec due to HB not needing sunders to be at its best, which only increases my concern. <br>
<br>
with 2h I avg 2700 dps on dummy, sans pet. <br>
with 44/27 I havent come close to that, even with a perma pet. <br>
<br>
IT PS HB BS BS DMP<br>
IT PS HB IT IT DMP x repeat <br>
<br>
is what I have been using, im not sure if Im doing it wrong or what, but the best I can manage in the exact same gear is 2300 (WITH GHOUL) and this doesnt seem right. <br>
<br>
What I really need is some help getting the optimal rotation, ( I think what my friend told me to use, isnt quite right)<br>
<br>
<br>
Thanks for your help!<br>
<br>
<br>
One last thing, Im using IT, FS, Ghoul glyphs, and IT Sigil. FC on Hatestrike (MH) CG on Grasscutter (OH)<br>

		<!-- message -->
		<div class="intellitxt" id="post_message_1085973"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Simple question ----------------------<br>
<br>
I am getting mixed advice on tanking caps for hit and expertise.  I have great DPS gear but want to start saving up for tanking spec.<br>
<br>
Getting 540 defense is the first part to worry about Which I don't even have that with just blues. (I have Rep rewards, crafted, and some drops that have DEF)  I am a blacksmith so I can add 3 gem slots for hit or dodge or whatever.<br>
<br>
So if I try to get hit cap and expertise cap I will loose dodge or defense.<br>
<br>
Someone said hit was not really as important, about 200 is ok which I think is bull.  That's 6.10 (Aprox) hit.  Then they said but get about 24-26 expertise is next priority, which I also think is bull.  And yes this was with a 2H not a DW...<br>
<br>
I have experimented with expertise and find that 8% chance to hit (I almost always have a draenei in my group) and 12ish expertise is fine when I am DPS in a 25 man.  Maybe three attacks at most will get dodged in a fight, maybe 1 depending on how long the fight is.<br>
<br>
Can I apply the same theory to tanking? I am looking to tank 5 man heroics or 10 man Naxx to start and I don't want to be squishy.  Is 26 expertise more important than hit, and is the claim that 6% chance to hit is all that's needed valid in any way?<br>
<br>
What should I be going for in tanking stats?<br>
<br>
540 Def<br>
??? Avoidance (Total added together from Dodge, Parry, and where ever else since DKs have no shield)<br>
?? Hit<br>
?? Expertise<br>
<br>
Where can I go for more info -------------------------------<br>
<br>
Can you point me to a thread that has updated (3.0.8) tanking advice?  I have seen some threads but it is hard to find the info I want on the first page with latest changes to DKs and hard to wade through 54 pages of info.<br>
<br>
Where should I be for these things:<br>
<br>
1) Avoidance (Parry and Dodge) and which is easiest to raise up to start off with?  Pros and cons of dodge vs parry.<br>
2) Stats on gear.  Agility gives Crit and Dodge, Str gives AP and Parry.. Which will get avoidance quickest without lowering threat.  (In otherwords having high crit but low AP, or vise versa)<br>
3) Which is better for generating max threat?  AP or STR and I say that because some bonuses are calculated off the STR stat or Armor from items but don't calculate a bonus from total AP.  Pros and cons of white damage and IT, PS, BS, FS...<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<!-- message -->
		<div id="post_message_1086153"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I'm quite familiar with gemming at lvl 80, but while I level (currently 65) my 2H Unholy DK I've come across a couple of items with sockets.  On top of that I'm a lvl 450 JC.<br>
<br>
While I'm in the 65 - 75 range I'm obviously going to be uncapped on exp and hit.  Since I am a JC I have many gems laying around (in other words - money for gems is no object - I can change them every day if I wish.)<br>
<br>
So... Should I just pile on the str while leveling, or should I try to get my hit and exp up?  I'm pretty sure I could cap my exp, but I won't be fighting many bosses until I approach 80.<br>
<br>
What do you suggest?  Str?  Sta?  Hit?  Exp?<br>
<br>
Thank you.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Yes. Mainly because test dummy performance is not going to provide accurate enough data for you to calculate stat weights that are accurate in a raid environment, and because actual raid parses will vary immensely, not only on simple things like what raid buffs are present (which you could probably account for), but also vary by things like the other dps in the raid, as well as various "RNG" factors.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>While DW'ing, your offhand and your main-hand have the exact same percent chance to hit. The difference arises with special attacks, which have a hitcap of 8% and almost always use the main-hand weapon (one notable exception is BCB, which uses the offhand weapon).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>This is my understanding of the situation. Until Blizz introduces another resist fight like Illidan, Hydros or Mother, there is no reason at all to take Acclimation as a DK.

</div>I greatly prefer Frost for on adds. I can't use Morbidity, but probably more importantly I'm simply more experienced and comfortable with Frost. Holding aggro is pretty easy for either Frost or Unholy, but I find securing initial aggro as the elementals spawn is easier with the harder-hitting Icy Touch.<br>
<br>
I'm not sure if you've tried it since then, but the KM buff in 3.0.8 is a massive DPS boost for Frost AOE tanking.<br>
<br>
With Shadron + twilight torment, even the non-enraged elementals start to hit pretty hard. Good to know that Acclimation isn't completely wasted, thanks.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>First don't start a post by "not sure this hasn't been asked before". There's a search feature, use it. With that said, I doubt anyone asked that before, because it's totally false. The only benefit of attacking from behind, besides obvious positionning requirements on stuff like backstab, is removing parry off bosses(and dodges off players). It is however a huge benefit, as boss parry rate is around 15%, meaning you do 15% less dmg from the front. There's also parry haste issues, so melee dps should always attack from behind.

</div>The point of me saying that was that I did use the search function and couldn't find anything. Just a bit of politeness, and such. I was told that it was so old it was "assumed", so wasn't sure if it'd just been pushed off or blah.<br>
<br>
Also, real quick one. The extra runic power generated through the 4p T7 bonus wouldn't be worth using the T7 chest piece, right? Currently using the <a id="itemlink" class="q4" style=" font-weight: bold;" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091120084306/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=39767" target="_blank">[Undiminished Battleplate]</a> which puts me at the dodge cap for expertise and a little above the hit cap, but if I were to switch it out for the T7, I'd get that extra runic power. Current the 21/50 2h frost spec, so no idea if the extra Frost Strikes would out-weigh the chance to be dodged, since Frost Strike can't be dodged or anything.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>This is not true; attacking a mob from behind will lower your chance to be parried, which in turn will only increase your chance to hit. Your crit chance will remain unchanged.

Melee classes DPS from behind to avoid getting parried and etc etc, but is there some other benefit from doing this? I've had different people tell me no, and other people tell me there's an increased chance to crit from being behind a mob. Is it true? If so, does it apply to Death Knights?</div>

</div>Mobs can parry. The expertise hardcap is stupidly high, no one will conceive getting it. It takes like 490expertise rating to be hardcapped. That's why you attack from the back. The cleaves/breaths are obviously a bonus, but they only happen on certain mobs anyway, you still want to be behind every mob, even if they have no abilities.<br>
<br>
Edit: Actually only bosses have such a high parry, on mobs you could probably hardcap expertise. If that's what you meant, then yeah. There's still no reason to stand in front of mobs when you can get behind.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Looking at the top raid dps thread, some extremely high dps numbers were posted for players with dual fallen crusader. When you look at their WMO details, they have very similar buff uptime, 63% and 64%. Looking at my own uptime, it varies betwen 50% and 46%.<br>
<br>
My question to math oriented DKs is: Is that ~15/20% extra uptime on fallen crusader superior to having cinderglacier on the offhand? I would do the math, but im pretty clueless with numbers im afraid.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div class="intellitxt" id="post_message_1096080"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Kelthuryon: Dual wield simply deals more white damage than 2H by a significant margin.<br>
<br>
With 4000 raid buffed AP, no talents, no hit/crit, and ilvl213ish weapons:<br>
<br>
2H deals 200 damage per second plus attack power contribution. Attack power contribution is AP/14 or 285.7dps. Damage contribution is 92% due to missrate. Total dps is (200+285.7)*.92 or 446.8dps.<br>
<br>
Mainhand DW deals 150 damage per second plus attack power contribution. Attack power contribution is AP/14 or 285.7dps. Damage contribution is 73% due to missrate. Total dps is (150+285.7)*.73 or 318.1dps.<br>
<br>
Offhand DW deals 150 damage per second plus attack power contribution. Attack power contribution is AP/14 or 285.7dps. Damage contribution is 36.5% due to missrate and offhand penalty. Total dps is (150+285.7)*.365 or 159dps.<br>
<br>
Total DW DPS: 477.1<br>
DPS delta: 30.3<br>
<br>
Most hybrid builds can take Nerves of Cold Steel but not 2H specialization. NoCS adds roughly 16% damage contribution (3% mainhand, 14% offhand) or 69.7dps.<br>
<br>
Total DPS delta: 100.0<br>
<br>
Necrosis multiplies white damage by roughly 120% (actually more due to double-dipping from percentage damage buffs). Adding 35% crit multiplies by 135% (actually more due to the way hit tables work).<br>
<br>
Total DPS delta: 162.0<br>
<br>
The effects of BCB and hit gear are beyond the scope of this napkin, however suffice it to say that BCB has been continually proven to work better the faster your weapon is, and hit gear obviously works better when you can benefit from more than 8%.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

This means it gets it's damage boosted by Ebon Plaguebringer but not impurity.  All effects that raise damage dealt by abilities such as Rage of Rivendare, Blood Presence, Bone Shield, Desecration, Tundra Stalker, and Blood Gorged raise it's damage.<br>

Effects that raise all damage cause double dipping.  It raises the damage of the hit and Necrosis uses that as a base damage, then it gets multiplied again by the modifier.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

This seems like too big of a uptime difference to me? Apart from a possible bug in WMO, shouldnt the range be much smaller?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1104541"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Being a Warlock with a DK alt, I need some advice. I have read through all the threads on the DK forum here, and I have a pretty good understanding. My question relates to DPS specs in beginner gear. Not sure how to put the question so lets try:<br>
<br>
What spec/tree gives an higher than expected dps for low end gear builds?<br>
<br>
Example: As a warlock that starts to raid you would advise someone to go 0/41/30 because the talents make up for bad gear, allowing you to do better dps for your gear, than you would with the true "powerhouse" builds like 55/0/18 or 0/20/51. <br>
<br>
Is there something similar with DK and dps. <br>
For example: I see the "disease-less" blood dps spec, and people saying you need very good gear for it, is there something exactly opposite. Aka where you can do decent dps with bad gear, until you get better gear?<br>

I've met people who refuse to count miss as avoidance, I personally think it should be counted.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Is it more beneficial for a dual-wielding deathknight to use 2 fast weapons or a slow mainhand?<br>

It might be easier if I present an example: Is it better to use Titansteel Bonecrusher and Hailstorm because of extra Bloodstrike dmg from main-hand. Or to use Hailstorm and Widow's Fury for more Fallen Crusader procs and bigger weapon dps?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Also in the TTT, in the DK DPS thread, there is the comparison between stats. For unholy, and unholy only, str is even better than pre capped hit. Expertise is the third stronger stat, if I remember correctly, but since gem wise exp and str are both red, there's no way you are going to gem for exp, since every red is going to be str (orange = str + hit, if you need hit and want the socket bonus, of course, etc. ).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
I leveled up my DK alt, my main is a Prot Warrior, and i have started to tank some heroics and it has gone well so far. <br>
<br>
I specced Unholy tanking as i felt AoE skills would be a nice change from my warrior. plus i hear the Unholy tank has a little more versatility DPS-wise so i figured i'd start there.<br>
<br>
My Question:<br>
So i think i have been doing pretty good with my rotations for threat, etc. but I have a little nagging doubt that i think comes from the fact that my history is in rage-based tanking.<br>
<br>
~ I read the rotations that are suggested: IT-PS-BS-BS-SS SS-SS-SS <br>
~ I do my best to follow those but towards the second half I find that i am not able to immediately use the SS every GCD. I am used to warrior tanking where every single GCD you hit oen of several options.<br>
<br>
So my questions is, am I missing something? or are there actually times where DK tanks are waiting for runes to use the next ability in their rotation?<br>
<br>
my DK armory is here <br>

The second part of the rotation ( the 3 SS) unload all your runes in 3 GCD and have to wait 5.5 second until the first set of runes refresh. If you are using Rune Strike during your tanking rotation, you probably don't even have RP for Death Coil.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">What spec/tree gives an higher than expected dps for low end gear builds?<br>
<br>
Example: As a warlock that starts to raid you would advise someone to go 0/41/30 because the talents make up for bad gear, allowing you to do better dps for your gear, than you would with the true "powerhouse" builds like 55/0/18 or 0/20/51. <br>
<br>
Is there something similar with DK and dps. <br>
For example: I see the "disease-less" blood dps spec, and people saying you need very good gear for it, is there something exactly opposite. Aka where you can do decent dps with bad gear, until you get better gear?<br>
( I don't mean 6k dps, I mean just not 1500 dps)</div>

	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>If you're a good player, you'll do fine DPS in blues with any spec. If you're Blood, you'll probably want to stick to a diseased rotation until you're geared enough for diseaseless. Other than that, worrying about switching specs as your gear changes is honestly just going to hinder you in my opinion. Pick a spec that's fun (feel free to experiment between them) and learn how to play it well, and learn how to gear that spec. I put out 3300 DPS on 5 minute 10 man Patch with 2 epics and blue tanking swords. Play what you know, and play it well. There's no good DPS spec that's going to magically put out terribad numbers if you're at low gear levels and you know what you're doing.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Well first of all, I'm sorry if I'm out of line, I don't post here often.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
When it's in the TTT that Strength is better than Hit even when uncapped, it is not universally accepted, is it? There is an exception to the "rule". I don't see how you can say that it's a "rule" to cap hit when you, in the same sentence even, say that Str is better than everything? <br>
<br>
What you're really dealing with here is that you personally like having your hitcap, which is fine, but it doesn't have anything to do with what's best in this case from what I can see. Recommending to cap Hit when Strength is better isn't really that nice.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Personally, I'll always go with what's better and also pay attention to the fire.  This is especially true now that missed strikes from death runes don't repop as non-death runes anymore, before that change I was much more inclined to cap hit/exp first.<br>
<br>
However, there are plenty of strong DKs (Zurm comes to mind) who prefer knowing their attacks are going to land when they want them to land.  It's a valid personal preference, but to say it's universal is a pretty huge overstatement.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Except for the fact this started with a post me and darkside answered, and the post was talking about Unholy DPS. And unholy dps for single target has a rotation which is for most of the time just a SS spam. So misses/dodges/parries really means nothing for the rotation. You can't screw it. The only case when such rotation is a bit sensible to such events is when you need to reapply diseases manually.<br>
<br>
That's why I asked for darkside to explain me his reasons, since all I could imagine for him to give his answer was to rise the aoe dps on trahses too (I'm under the assumption the values in TTT refear to single target dps only and aren't correct for aoe too). But unholy aoe dps is just throught spells, so only hit is needed (and much more than the melee normal anyway).<br>
So I ended up with partial explaination for hit and no reason at all for expertise.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Personally, I'll always go with what's better and also pay attention to the fire.  This is especially true now that missed strikes from death runes don't repop as non-death runes anymore, before that change I was much more inclined to cap hit/exp first.<br>

However, there are plenty of strong DKs (Zurm comes to mind) who prefer knowing their attacks are going to land when they want them to land.  It's a valid personal preference, but to say it's universal is a pretty huge overstatement.</div>

</div>Perhaps "pretty universally accepted" was a poor choice of wording...despite the fact that I worded it that way to account for those who simply choose Str over everything else.  My main point was that I'd wager most do indeed prefer to know their attacks will land, especially since there's only 1 Patchwerk.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I'm fairly certain that the purpose of this thread is to give answers to simple questions that haven't been asked 100 times.  It is not a meant to be a substitute for self help and a basic level of effort on your part.  There are numerous threads, such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100809232300/http://elitistjerks.com/f72/t46054-pre_raid_dk_tank_gear/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100809232300/http://elitistjerks.com/f72/t42539-death_knight_faq_read_before_posting/" target="_blank">here</a> in this very forum that deal with DK tank gearing.  Not to mention, try using <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100809232300/http://www.codeplex.com/Rawr/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=22550" target="_blank">Rawr</a>, and look for possible upgrades.  <br>
<br>
Simply PM'ing someone and asking them to tell you how to gear is no excuse for lack of effort on your part.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div class="intellitxt" id="post_message_1110960"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->What spec should I go for if I'm just starting out as an 80 DK tank? Think gear in the Tempered Saronite stuff region and other such quality gear to start off with. I know the true and often said "All specs of DK can tank" sentence, but I admit I'm really trying to be the best and fastest DK tank I can be. Right now I'm levelling in a Blood spec that includes some tanking talents and also has 3/3 Morbidity, but it almost seems too little to really go through stuff fast at times. I know it seems silly but the 4-5 seconds I often have to wait for DnD to come off CD after the previous pack so I can pull the next make me crazy. I wonder if this will change in any way as once I get to 80? I'm guessing not, which makes me lean towards Frost, but I'm going to raid tank as Blood.. Anyway, thanks for any eventual opinions/answers. <br>
<br>
The specs I'm thinking of are these:<br>

		<div class="intellitxt" id="post_message_1111013"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Tanking aoe as blood probably implies a lot of target swapping (so that HS hits 2 different targets everytime) since you have only 1 really strong aoe ability (d&amp;d).<br>
I always tanked as frost at 80. While I was Unholy while levelling. I can tell the second one is way easier to handle, but the first one is more fun, for me at least (plus it used to require more skill when there was still a cd on pestilence).<br>
Anyway, I suggest frost, since everywhere everything is only aoe, aoe, aoe.<br>
This is true in heroics and in raids, as of now.<br>
For a frost spec I highly suggest the one I'm currently using (I am not going to respec, so you can be sure what you see is what I suggest you). You sacrifice 2% dodge but you increase your dps/tps AND get a nice +6% stam which you can combine with garg on weapon for a neat increase of stam, which is kind of all the pugs want from a tank (so you can find group to gear up more easyly).<br>
<br>
Point is that epidemic is nice only for aoe, where you can throw in 1 more blood boil instead of needing to pestilence. <br>
For single target rotation you are going to reapply your disease (notice the lack of the final "s") at every rotation.<br>
Plus if you are frost all you need to cast is HB in order to get nice aoe dps, morbidity isn't needed.<br>
<br>
AoE rotation is pretty standard: "pre d&amp;d" IT PS Pestilence, than HB BB etc<br>
<br>
Single target works best with 1 disease rotation. But you need 1 death rune in the opening, so you may need to use your Blood Tap if you haven't one from the last fight.<br>
IT OB OB BS "Rime + Rune dump"<br>
Rince and repeat.<br>
Depending on your gear you may have better results with HB, but due to the limited amount of hit we have (we cap for the 8% melee miss), it's easy that the chance to miss of spells (HB) and the +9% crit chance for OB make s it so it's better, dps/tps wise, to use OB on bosses.<br>
<br>
I use HB in place of the first OB on everything but bosses since that's what works for my gear. At the beginning probably you should use OB in every circumstance.<br>
<br>
EDIT:<br>
Glyph wise I use Obliterate, Rune Strike and Icy Touch. The latter being a must.<br>
That's kind of an aggressive setup, but as of now I can sacrifice Glyph of UA without a problem.<br>
Glyph of IF + UA + IT was what I used, but you'll find out glyph of IF isn't really vital (you just need to be careful with your rp usage). UA is nice. I swapped it out since I couldn't decide what was better between RS and OB glyphs, and eventually I found I'm ok with my current glyph configuration.<br>
<br>
<br>
P.S.<br>
Since tps isn't going to be a problem, you can go for Rune tap + imp rune tap + glyph of rune tap if you don't trust the average pug healer, at the Dark Conviction (aka crit), but tps has never been a problem for me untill now so you'll manage. The only ones that beat me tps wise are pally tanks.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

My reasoning is that with the PS glyph and the talent we can get a large boost to PS damage and since descration is a snare we'd get another 20% on BS.  That seems like a lot to me; but cookie cutters are usually cookie cutters for a reason!<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>By Pestilence, do you mean the Outbreak talent?<br>
<br>
The 2h unholy DPS builds I've seen don't take plague strike-based talents because the combination of extended durations on diseases and the scourge strike glyph causes you to not use plague strike very often.  A typical 2h unholy rotation will go something like PS-&gt;IT-&gt;BS-&gt;BS-&gt;SS in the first 10 seconds, followed by three straight scourge strikes in the second 10, giving you four chances for the scourge strike glyph to refresh your disease rotation, in which case you carry on using scourge strike instead of plague strike and icy touch.  Four 25% chances = just under 70% chance that one of them will happen, so it's very easy to go 30 seconds between uses of plague strike.  Given all that, it's not worth putting talent points into boosting plague strike or talents that fire when you use plague strike.<br>
<br>
A fair number of the dual wield specs out there do include Outbreak and/or Desecration, because they don't use scourge strike in their rotations, and therefore are plague striking enough for the talents to be worthwhile.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Woops; yes indeed.  I think I could have been more clear; I am wondering if taking Outbreak and Desecration and the PS and BS glyphs would be a DPS increase over the SS strike glyph.  Glyphs would be PS, BS and Ghoul.<br>
<br>
PS Would get 45% from Outbreak and 20% from the glyph if you IT first in your rotation and BS would get 20% from the glyph since desecration works as a snare.  Are all of these dps gains beaten by another Scourge Strike if you get a SS glyph proc?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Yes, until PS is changed to do more weapon damage, SS glyph will be the highest dps gain for sustained dps.  I would assume for soloing PS glyph may be better, but soloing is not the reason for these boards.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Any decent PvE spec will pick up both Unholy Aura and Dirge if you're that deep in the tree.  PvP specs often favor Unholy Aura.<br>
<br>
We can't estimate how much personal DPS it's worth because it varies heavily depending on the fight and how much running you have to do.  For example, on Patchwerk it's worth almost 0, but on Sarth it's worth a lot more.  Even on the latter it will still vary based on your guild's strat and how unlucky you get on void zones and lava waves.  <br>
<br>
The only specific math I recall seeing on run speed is from the enhancement shaman TTT, and that came to the conclusion that run speed boot enchants were better than straight-dps boot enchants if you spent roughly 4 seconds moving between adds, running to the boss, etc., in a 5 minute fight, which is often enough that you should always go for run speed.  Given that most fights that matter require and will probably continue to require a lot of movement for both survival and to get back on dps, that suggests that if you had to choose between the two, Unholy Aura will generally provide more benefit.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I would go with this build:<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100809232300/http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=jcEMqc0IsbRzuIZhxbzhZ0g" target="_blank">50/14/7</a><br>
The reason being is that you want WotN and Epidemic. If you have a Paladin tank have him deal with AE pulls like the packs of small spiders (name?) but when its a 3-4 mob pull he will probably AE when you can just focus on generating threat on 1-2 targets. If you have a Warrior then its pretty much going to be both of you going for AE threat, for example you can IT&gt;PS&gt;Pest&gt;Pest and then use Obliterate on targets someone has high threat on. You can also take Death Rune Mastery over Improved Rune Tap and then preAE pulls set it up to where you have 2 B and 4 D runes so that you can just Pest spam on the next pull. If you happen to have a bear then have him/her swipe spam the large spider groups.<br>
<br>
The point is, you can have the other tank do most of the AE tanking and on groups of 2-4 mobs just pick up the 1-2 mobs the other tank doesn't, you could mark Skull and Star for the MT and then Cross and Square for you. This makes it easier for some tanks then to just run in and AE a group of mobs without knowing who will get the most threat, this also makes it easier for the healers to know who may be taking more damage or that they should heal both tanks and instead of waiting to see who gets the most threat on the mobs.<br>
<br>
If someone says "Hey just drop DnD." well tell them you went a deep blood spec that doesn't have Improved DnD so its on a 30 second CD and you don't want to use it just in case the group accidentally pulls an extra pack or something of that nature.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1114832"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->So I was trying to get some values about my DK to write some theory crafting software, and I ran into something that puzzles me.<br>
<br>
When I get my lvl 80 orc buck naked, my strength is listed as:<br>
<br>
183 + 4<br>
<br>
I have both Ravenous Dead and Shadow of Death talents maxed out. So I would expect a 5% bonus to my str, but I'm only getting ~2%<br>
<br>
When I put on all my gear I see 183 + 931 = 1114. My gear has 883 str on it. So my str should be calculated at (183 + 883) *1.05 ~ 1119.<br>
<br>
The 1114 number seems to come from this calculation: 883*1.05 + 183*1.02. Meaning Ravenous Dead doesn't count base str, but Shadow of Death does. Is this intended? Glitchy UI? A Bug? Bueller?<br>
<br>
Someone else has also mentioned this in another thread. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091214063941/http://elitistjerks.com/1112027-post34.html" target="_blank">http://elitistjerks.com/1112027-post34.html</a><br>

<br>
edit: started playing around with +strength talents and noticed weird things; numbers to come.<br>
<br>
'base' and 'gear' refer to the color of the white+green format of the Strength tooltip in your character sheet.<br>
<br>
I recorded samples naked, and with gear totaling 1177 additional strength.<br>
<br>
I tried everything I could think of, and couldn't find a formula to explain how the different talents combine. Additively or multiplicatively, rounded up or down or truncated... none gave the numbers I'm listing -- although everything is within &lt;5 of what it could reasonably be expected to be (there are no 'bugs').<br>
<br>
As Xabi says below, some talents add their strength to the white <b>and</b> the green, others only to the green.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">So I was trying to get some values about my DK to write some theory crafting software, and I ran into something that puzzles me.<br>
<br>
When I get my lvl 80 orc buck naked, my strength is listed as:<br>
<br>
183 + 4<br>
<br>
I have both Ravenous Dead and Shadow of Death talents maxed out. So I would expect a 5% bonus to my str, but I'm only getting ~2%<br>
<br>
When I put on all my gear I see 183 + 931 = 1114. My gear has 883 str on it. So my str should be calculated at (183 + 883) *1.05 ~ 1119.<br>
<br>
The 1114 number seems to come from this calculation: 883*1.05 + 183*1.02. Meaning Ravenous Dead doesn't count base str, but Shadow of Death does. Is this intended? Glitchy UI? A Bug? Bueller?<br>
<br>
Someone else has also mentioned this in another thread. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091214063941/http://elitistjerks.com/1112027-post34.html" target="_blank">http://elitistjerks.com/1112027-post34.html</a><br>
<br>
Thanks.</div>

</div>EDIT: After further review it looks like Ravenous Dead alters the "white" portion of your str. And SoD adds green. My naked str looks like this now:<br>
<br>
No talents naked: 178<br>
<br>
RD 1%: 179<br>
RD 2%: 181<br>
RD 3%: 183<br>
RD 3% + SoD: 183 + 4.<br>
<br>
I don't know why these talents seem to work differently.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1115509"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Hi there,<br>
<br>
we currently have an unholy DK with EB in the raid. I tried different specs to avoid the problem of the none stacking EB but somehow i do not reach the same DPS as with unholy, maybe thats because the unholy playstyle seems to fit me the best.<br>
<br>
Now i am searching for a viable solution to avoid the EB problem and still be able to play as unholy. The only thing i can come up with is to spec CF only, without EB. But i am not sure if thats the right way to go? And where to put the three spare points? Outbreak or desecration?<br>
<br>
Also i am considering to play without the gargoyle because i hate that thing, always staring at your buffs to wait for the perfect moment makes me crazy. The one point could be spent on virulance instead. Or is that idea a no go?<br>
<br>
And as a final thought, would a complete UH pet-less spec be viable (without perma ghul)?<br>
<br>
I appreciate your feedback on my questions. Thanks Fx.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Unless it was changed at the last minute, this ceased to be true with 3.0.8. I just searched the unholy dps thread, and I do not think it was changed.<br>
<br>
But keep in mind that a DK benefits from his third disease in a small, constant way that will not scale with gear. At the time of 3.0.8's release, it was generally considered insignificant, and it will only become more so.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Going without gargoyle would be crazy.  Even post-nerf, gargoyle is easily 4% of your dps for 1 talent point, you're not going to get that kind of boost from 1 point anywhere else.  You're better off just ignoring buffs if it's driving you nuts and just popping Gargoyle at the beginning during the first Mirror proc, then later whenever it's off cooldown.  It won't be as ideal as waiting for a pop or BL later, but it's better than dropping it entirely.<br>
<br>
Ghoul is generally just under 15% of my dps.  It would be even crazier to spec deep unholy and go petless.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Darkside, I used your spreadsheet to calculate my stat weights, and plugged those into the WoWHead.com item comparison to get a ranking on all the one handers (I'm 0/33/38, for the record). Aside from dual <a id="itemlink" class="q4" style=" font-weight: bold;" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100117071359/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=40402" target="_blank">[Last Laugh]</a>, it was showing AD, WF, then Hailstorm as far as best to use.<br>
<br>
Do you think I should continue to AD/WF, or pursue WF/HS? I'm personally leaning twards AD/WF, but would like a secondary input.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
According to wowhead, mirror has an ICD of 45 seconds, but only procs off crits. From looking at WWS it seems to proc once a minute, so the average AP gained from MoT would be:<br>
<br>
60/10 = 1/6<br>
1/6*1000=166.67AP<br>
<br>
Mirror also have 84 crit rating, which according to Darksides spreadsheet is worth 153 AP<br>
<br>
So the value of MoT would be 167+153=320<br>
<br>
Exactly the same as Fury of the Five Flights.<br>
<br>
Does anyone have some numbers to input? or should we simple conclude that they are pretty equal?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I've been looking through all the dps specs on this board, i've currently only tried out the blood dps spec so far (disease free) and it's been dishing out a good deal of dps for my level. <br>
<br>
I'm curious though, of all the dps specs listed on this forum, is it clear which one is the "best" or at least, if one is a tad bit better then the others?</div>

2) is DRW&gt;gargoyle atm? (as i understand after patch drw will be only option)<br>
3) not sure if this is the place to ask... im kinda going pug raids and heroics (50/0/21), using no diseases unless i need to heal or there is loads of aoe mobs who dont die in 10sec.. usualy i beat most of dks, even better geared, though maybe its becouse most mobs die before diseases wear off.. though all dks i know uses diseases, so probably with doing diseases i would improve my dps - so how much dps i loose/gain? as long as i know, dpsing pack of 2 mobs, nothing beats disease less rotation..<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>The Badge Sigil affects Heart Strike, a strike you use just to get to Death Runes.<br>

The SoAB modifies your main strike, a strike that, ideally, gets used 5-6 times every 20 seconds or so, roughly.<br>

Since this is the place for easy (?) questions, here's mine :<br>
<br>
Which are currently the two best DPS trinkets for a DK :<br>
<br>
- using the 17/0/54 spec?<br>
- using the 0/32/39 spec with dual wield?<br>
- using a frost DPS spec such as 21/50/0 or 0/44/27 (with a 2-hander)?<br>
<br>
If you could be so kind to backup your answer with a little math (that for the life of me, i cant figure out myself), or redirect me to the theory behind the answer, that'd be awesome<br>

</div>It would depend on what you current tank gear is at.  See the tanking threads for priorities, but for raids you want 540 defense, then either avoidance or stamina, depending on which you prefer to have.<br>
<br>
I would look at which slots were weakest, then see if a heroic or Naxx-10 has an item to make that slot stronger.<br>

		<div id="post_message_1134076"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->hi all, I've been reading the forums at EJ for awhile and I've learnt a lot. I am currently trying to improve my dps as unholy dps. I'm spec the standard cookie cutter unholy build (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100116162947/http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=jfVMVZZfMbhxckgcoMfsut" target="_blank">17/0/54</a>) but I am having trouble breaking 4k dps on patchwerk. Unfortunately, I've yet to be able to get a WWS report because I have not been raiding for the past 2 weeks.<br>

<br>
I am fairly well geared, having BiS for most of my slots except my hands, belt, legs, trinket and weapon (Death's Bite). I am hit capped and have 17 expertise. I have glyphed icy touch, ghoul and scourge strike. I am also fully raid buffed, potted and +40 str food buffed. I would usually AotD before the pull. My rotation is ps, it, bs, bs, ss, runic dump -&gt; ss, ss, ss, runic dump -&gt; (if ss glyph procs) ss, bs, bs, ss, runic dump<br>
<br>
Could someone point out where I am going wrong? Or is having the BiS trinkets that much of a difference?<br>

</div>It's a fair question. The DPS compendium thread is quite out of date with regards to Blood and Dual Wield. The FAQ is also a bit dated, but you can check the relevant threads to find post 3.0.8 changes if you so desire. The best sources are the individual spec threads, however they've been cluttered with information from the PTR, so you may have to dig back a ways to find a high density of Live related knowledge.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Yeah, i always keep UB up, and DC when i had no runes to use unless I had gargoyle up. Even with gargoyle up, i can still maintain UB at the same time. And i try to only use gargoyle when as many of my procs are up during BLust, which i would then pop my trink and blood fury (orc racial) before casting gargoyle. I've done what most of the Unholy dps thread has posted, but still getting under 4k, I'm quite annoyed and vexed by the amount of dps I'm putting out. Unfortunately, my guild has not started using WMO and I have not been raiding for the past 2 weeks. Anymore input will be much appreciated. Thanks.<br>

</div>I don't think it's possible to grab everything atm (live), however, i believe blood seems to be quite capable of AE tanking without much problems in ptr, at least that is what i've heard. Also, your tanking role decides your spec, pretty much, as it is now. Blood makes good MT for Sarth 3D, some say that frost puts out a lot of threat, while unholy does very good AE tps. So, it really depends on what tanking role you will be filling.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1135598"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I am a DK tank currently running with Death's Bite. I feel like lacking in threat rather than evasion (I don't have a problem with taking too much dmg, or perhaps haelers are very good) but anyway the only bad thing that happens when I tank really is that sometimes the dps over aggros. While I understand that dps should hold back, I would like to generate enough threat so the dps doesn't have to worry about aggro.<br>
<br>
For this purpose I wanted to take Betrayer of Humanity. Since I am leader in dkp currently I expected to receive that item but instead, it got given to a retribution paladin. They said it was dps prio.<br>

I then did research into stats on various weapons and again I came to Betrayer of Humanity as best weapon for tanking. My guild told me to get Black Ice but I feel like my Death's Bite is better than that weapon already.<br>
<br>
Am I right to be angry that Betrayer of Humantiy was given away as dps prio or should I get a different weapon instead?<br>
<br>
Perhaps you could help me with some strong arguments on how to convince the officers of my case that I think Betrayer of Humanity is best for tanking.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I don't think my answer will please you but, you shouldn't have any problem holding aggro with Deathbite , and BoH won't help you a lot in that way.<br>

You should maybe change some point in your template. Take a look at mine. Sure you lost some survivability abilities, but as you, I didn't feel I need them to do my job. But in exchange you gain a lot of Single Target and Multiple Target threat.<br>

Ask yourself some question : <br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I don't think it's possible to grab everything atm (live), however, i believe blood seems to be quite capable of AE tanking without much problems in ptr, at least that is what i've heard. Also, your tanking role decides your spec, pretty much, as it is now. Blood makes good MT for Sarth 3D, some say that frost puts out a lot of threat, while unholy does very good AE tps. So, it really depends on what tanking role you will be filling.</div>

</div>Don't RP dump when you're tanking.  Pop UB if your next ability would put you over 100, and pop DC if you're in that spot and UB's still up, but the latter will be rare; you should be keeping RP in reserve to make sure you always have plenty available for chain Runestrikes, which will happen often.  I MTed Patchwerk-25 the other day in dps spec, so I had considerably less parry/dodge than I would in tank spec, and I still used Runestrike 50 times in a 3 minute fight compared to 1 DC.  132 ticks of UB, so that was up about 75% of the fight.<br>
<br>
If threat is your problem, macro Runestrike to every ability, if you're not already.  If you don't, it's very likely you're going to miss procs; I'll sometimes notice it proc and hit back to back to back, it's extremely unlikely I'd be able to notice and hit that key quickly enough to take advantage.<br>
<br>
Also, why are you popping IT/PS again in your second round?  You should have 18s duration, so you're reapplying them 8s early by doing that.  Your rotation should look like the unholy rotation in Suno's thread:  IT-PS-BS-BS-SS SS-SS-SS.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I want to say before reading these posts I was stumbling around Outlands and Northrend on my silly little DK doing sub par DPS and barely having any fun at all...I came here out of frustration and knew I was missing something vital to making my DK something worth logging on to play.  I must say after observing the info in these posts my DPS has nearly doubled and I haven't had this much fun playing WoW since I can remember!<br>

Specifically, I'd like to know when I'm about to burn death runes on an ability, but I don't think it should be necessary to check the currently available runes. I'd like a mod that simply colored the icon purple if Death runes would be used for the ability. That would eliminate the need to check a separate area for rune information, because all I need to know is when an ability will be ready to cast (already available as the cooldown on the ability), and whether the ability will consume a Death rune or not (not currently possible without looking at the runes).<br>

		<div id="post_message_1143225"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Hey guys, I have a question- I honestly haven't looked at wowwebstats much, so I'm fairly new at interpreting the information therein.  A friend is trying to understand what he's looking at with regard to the percentages under "mitigation", noting that almost all of his shadow based damage is showing as 100% or close to it, with regard to "mitigated" on the Raz fight.  I'm not clear on how to actually interperet it, and thought it was an appropriate question for the simple questions thread, as it's probably a pretty basic thing we're overlooking.  Anyways, here's the page:<br>

<br>
Is there an ability that Raz does that we're overlooking, or are we misunderstanding what the 100% and such that is in that column actually means?   I'm aware of partial resists from level differences, but not sure how to interperet what I'm seeing there.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Considering that Blood specs heavily rely on ArP (mostly through sunders), yes raidbuffs do matter a lot. Several hundred dps difference on a testing dummy between blood und unholy is not surprising. That's why comparison of specs via dummy is not a good idea. Get in a raid and compare then.<br>

</div>I haven't tested this one specifically, but the way reputation works leads me to believe that the game tracks at least some values to greater precision than it shows.  For example, if you're a human killing mobs that give 15 base reputation, the 10% reputation bonus should give you 16.5 rep total per kill.  What I've seen in this case is a steady alternation of 16 rep for one kill, then 17 for the next, as if the game were tracking that half-point of reputation but rounding to the nearest integer.<br>

</div>to 1) BoH is BiS for every 2H spec, regardless of class, i don't think there's a list with best DW weapons for each spec, and if i'm wrong it's buried within the big threads. Maybe a DW guy knows them and sees your post.<br>
<br>
to 2) Depends on the AEPs for each spec, that's why retri don't value hit much, stacking pure strength is simply more dps (plus their BiS gear doesn't have much hit to begin with afaik). For DKs this is generally not true because not being hit (and expertise) capped tends to screw up our rotation and hit has higher AEPs for us<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
I'm new to the DPS game.  I have been a healer for 4 years so I have no idea how melee DPS stats work.<br>
<br>
I just got my DK to 80 two days ago, and I have two weapons that I can't decide on using.<br>
<br>
I'm currently unholy spec, hit capped, human.<br>
<br>
The two weapons I can't decide between are CSCC and Black Ice.  CSCC seems like the better choice to me because of all the strength.  With it being more ap overall and scaling better with RFC, it just seems like a better choice.  However, I have heard people say that the extra 100 top end on Black Ice makes up for it (Even though the hit would be wasted because I am already capped)<br>
<br>
Any insight would be awesome.<br>
<br>

</div>I think you misunderstood me. Mirror provides on average 200 AP i think, that alone is more than the static 190 ap from bandit and the 84 crit is superior to non-scaling ~2k damage every 45-50 seconds. The internal cd on bandit's pretty much is the reason why it's inferior<br>

</div>The average on Mirror is about 150 AP over time.<br>
<br>
The damage from the trinket does scale with debuffs, so imp Scorch and imp FF affect it and the Unholy DK buffs:<br>
<br>
      Blood Presence: +15% increased damage<br>
      Bone Armor: +2% increased damage<br>
      Ebon Plague: +13% spell damage<br>

All those together should give about +32.549% increased damage.<br>

Also DRW (Blood DK) can proc this.<br>

</div>The spec you linked isn't a viable option now in all seriousness. You need Improved Icy Touch and Desecration isn't a good talent either. I mean you took Subversion which increase the critical strike chance of Heart Strike, Blood Strike, and Obliterate which you only use two Blood Strikes every other rotation. I realize you are trying to go for a tank/dps hybrid spec but trying to do that is extremely inefficient in both dps and tanking.<br>
<br>
I would honestly go with something like this for a tank/dps hybrid Unholy spec : <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100809231134/http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/classes/deathknight/talents.html?tal=2350020000000000000000000000050000000000000000000000000235200333000115003150003133151#none" target="_blank">10/8/53 Unholy</a><br>
<br>
I also have no idea where this would be useful either, besides 25man OS 0D or maybe an encounter where the real tanks are messing up... which usually isn't good. I think you should go full DPS 17/0/54 and if an add is on a healer just go into Frost Presence and get it off them that way. I find that Frost Presence is enough for 'off tanking' adds long enough for a tank to pick them up. I had a DPS spec DK tank the adds on KT, yes he was almost BiS DPS gear but all he had to do was switch presences and equip Slayer of the Lifeless in both slots.<br>

Is the link you posted for the 10/8/53 build wrong. I'm seeing a build that is 12/5/54 when I follow your link.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I thank you and Tahotar for your responses. <br>
Is the link you posted for the 10/8/53 build wrong. I'm seeing a build that is 12/5/54 when I follow your link.<br>
I've been looking into a the DPS builds, guess I'll have to reread them and give them some more thought. Thanks again for you responses.</div>

</div>Almost all crafting professions give the same amount of stats (~32 stat points, i.e. 64AP, 48 STA, etc), in that regard it doesn't matter what proffesions you take.<br>
<br>
BUT: JC and Blacksmithing allow more flexibility in what stats to take (STR &gt; AP for plate classes, most professions only have AP, STA and Spellpower to choose from), JC also lets you get socket bonusses and Meta requirements easier<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I read the read before posting thread &amp; on the armor &amp; avoidance section it states that for a tank you want 540 def &amp; 690 rating.  My question is: how do you obtain a 690 rating w/o gemming totally for def rating.  If you follow the link youll see that my rating is 640.  Im decently geared &amp; still 50 rating off of 690.  Perhaps Im gemming wrong.  Should I trade out the 27 def rating gem for a dodge dragons eye?<br>

</div>Level 80s start with 400 defense skill.  Every ~4.92 points of defense rating on gear gives you another point of defense skill, and you need 540 defense skill to be uncrittable.  The tanking sigil, which you have, gives you almost 11 defense skill as long as you keep it up, so with that you'll only need 529-530 defense skill.  You have 555, so you're actually well over and could stand to lose some defense.<br>
<br>
Don't worry about hitting 690 rating, just worry about hitting 540 defense skill, or 529-530 with the tanking sigil.  Looking at the defense rating will just screw you up if you're using Rune of the Stoneskin Gargoyle, which you are, because that gives you 25 points straight to defense skill, bypassing defense rating entirely.  Try downloading a mod like RatingBuster, which will put defense skill next to the rating on each item or gem, making it easy for you to see how much defense skill you'll gain or lose by regemming.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>To add to that: He is already at 555 Defense skill, meaning he is already 15 def skill over the cap and therefore crit immune.<br>
<br>
The 690 def rating rule is only true for Warriors and Paladins as they only have def skill as a means to get 540 def skill, but as DK you have also the option of a sigil and a runeforge<br>

		<div class="intellitxt" id="post_message_1154019"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I realize that threat is an issue with this idea.  That said, I've been looking at Death and Decay and how it can be integrated somehow in a DPS rotation.  I am surprised exactly how efficient this spell can be in a deep Unholy build.  The AP coefficient for DnD is 0.0475.<br>
<br>
It gets these bonuses:  Blood Presence (15%), Impurity (25%), Ebon Plaguebringer (13%), Crypt Fever (30%), Rage of Rivendare (10%), Desecration (5%), and Bone Shield (2%).<br>
<br>
One tick: 0.118  Ten ticks: 1.18<br>
<br>
If you can be assured that threat isn't an issue, it seems to have potential.  Using three runes and 15 sec cooldown, it's very clunky.  You have to be fast with the targeting and lag could be an issue.<br>
<br>
An example of how it could work on an Icy Touch build.  Begin with half a runic bar.<br>
<br>
PS -&gt; IT -&gt; IT -&gt; BS -&gt; DnD -&gt; DC -&gt; DC<br>
PS -&gt; IT -&gt; IT -&gt; BS -&gt; PS -&gt; DC -&gt; DC<br>
<br>
The opening requires a lot of haste and the use of Blood Tap in the opening directly after the Blood Strike.  I tested it and it works.  You could then revert to a normal rotation:<br>
<br>
PS -&gt; IT -&gt; IT -&gt; IT -&gt; BS -&gt; DC -&gt; DC<br>
PS -&gt; IT -&gt; IT -&gt; BS -&gt; IT -&gt; DC -&gt; DC<br>
<br>
Use this twice and repeat the first set since Blood Tap will come off cooldown.<br>
<br>
What's wrong with this other than threat?  It seems like someone else would have thought of this at some point.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>1)Take both and like any good tank equip the one that's best suited for the encounter. You can't answer such a question with a simple answer. some prefer STA, some avoidance<br>
<br>
2)Again preference, SS runeforge gives a little more avoidance while SSG gives a little more stamina and more flexibility in what to gem. But if you're having a hard time getting to 540 def skill even with only def gems SSG is probably the better choice<br>

PS &gt; IT &gt; SS &gt; BS &gt; BS &gt; RP<br>

after RP i then have two frost, two unholy and two death runes which essentially means 3 scourge strikes and back to two of each rune whereby I start up the rotation again, adjusting if my glyph doesn't refresh diseases.<br>
<br>
I'm not entirely sure why, but after scourge striking off the death runes, one refreshes as death, the other as blood. Now I can just ignore this and use the death rune and the blood rune to do the two blood strikes as usual, but is this common behaviour and I've just not read about it ?<br>

edit: just noticed it does this as dualweild (32/39) too, after icy touching my two death runes off, one refreshes as blood like it should, the other returns to death.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Necrosis double-dips into all damage multipliers. This means that it benefits from things like Blood Presence initially (when the swing damage is calculated) and when the Necrosis damage is calculated. <br>
<br>
Example:<br>
<br>
Your white-hit swing hits Mob X for 1000.<br>
<br>
1000*0.04 = 40 base Necrosis Damage<br>
<br>
Multipliers:<br>
<br>
Blood Presence = 1.15<br>
Ebon Plague = 1.13<br>
Desecration = 1.05<br>
Bone Shield = 1.02<br>
<br>
Final Necrosis Damage = 40*1.15*1.13*1.05*1.02 = 56<br>
<br>
This is actually a 5.6% increase instead of the 4% you are led to believe from the tooltip.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, Necrosis can "crit" in that whenever your swings crit, it calculates its damage from that value. BCB cannot, to the best of my knowledge, crit (though it can be dodged, something that has always bothered me).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Hmm you give 2 conflicting statements here.<br>
<br>
First you say pets only gain the raid version (improved icy talons) and then you say pets get haste from their master.<br>
<br>
I know the latter is true, hence i was assuming that 20% melee haste from Icy Talons, is transcended to the pets.<br>
Of course this is assuming you don't have a raid buff version.<br>
<br>
Much like they also gain the haste from Unholy Presence, and the haste from a Potion of Speed.<br>
<br>
So as far as i know, Icy Talons (or any of the other raid wide haste buffs) affect:<br>
<br>
- White damage<br>
- Pets (DRW / Ghoul / Garg / AotD)<br>
- Procs<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1165809"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Hello,<br>
<br>
I have read a good part of this thread, I'm totally noob to unholy having been blood for leveling and DW frost/unholy until last night when I finally got a 2H weapon worth switching for (plus the upcoming patch nerfing it obviously)<br>
<br>
My question is actually simple, Unholy seems to have a lot of down time in the rotation where you are blocked by death runes who stops you from doing blood strike or stuff like that. I can always use ERW to save myself once, but this prevents you pretty much from using a castsequence macro to ease your job. I'm wondering, what should you do when everything in cooldown, wait or pop anything that isn't on cooldown, like Icy Touch to maximize your dps.<br>
<br>
I have not raided yet with this spec, but it's doing more dps on a training dummy that my DW build was doing so I am confident.<br>
<br>
Another thing, I have seen mixed opinion on this, so I'm still looking for insights, but I have enough gear to swap to play with most spec, and I am wondering with Unholy if the spell hit cap is THAT important over crit... good example is I have Sapphiron's breast plate vs the 100 hit breast plate (from Noth or Heigan, I don't remember).. all sources are saying the Breatplate of Frozen Pain is better, but that doesn't make me spell hit capped, while the others, and with other elements in my gear, would make me (I can stack up to 500 hit in raid with some gear configuration, which obviously is way too much)<br>
<br>
So, I understand strength and AP should go first, but no theory I'm reading really tell you if the gap between melee hit and spell hit is important before crit, obviously I understand that the melee hit is important but that's not really a problem.<br>
<br>
Since it's a new spec and I'm trying to get everything I need to perform well, I'll continue reading all these thread and look forward to use this spec for 3.1<br>
<br>
Thanks.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1165827"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I'm not entirely sure what you're asking, so I'll throw out the generic unholy rotation for you to have a look at. <br>
<br>
Generally, you open up with Icy Touch -&gt; Plauge Strike -&gt; Scourge Strike -&gt; 2x Blood Strike.<br>
<br>
From there, you empty all your Runic Power, either through Unholy Blight or Death Coil, depending on the fight. <br>
<br>
If your runes have recharged yet, wait for them to do so and then slam 2x Scourge Strikes. If you get a proc off the glyph, drop another in. If not, then you'll probably need to reapply your diseases. <br>
<br>
From there, empty your RP again, and simply repeat the whole cycle ad infinitum, using your Garg whenever the raidleader calls for a lust (hopefully they're not retarded and are lusting early). It's that easy.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>This makes no sense but I think there's a gist to this - You're rotations are off. Completely.<br>
<br>
In a DW HB build, your HB will almost never use both your Death Runes. The DRs are used to IT spam x3 or x4 (penidng if there was a Rime proc or not.) What this all boils down to is what you are using and since you did not inform us of such - we can't help you without more detail.<br>
<br>
DW HB rotation [rough]: IT-&gt;PS-&gt;HB-&gt;BS-&gt;BS // ITx2-&gt;PS-&gt;HB-&gt;IT [RP Dump = DC when you have a spare GCD.]<br>
<br>
Every now and then you will eat an Unholy rune for a rotation if you're too stubborn to press the Plague Strike button, yes.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Basically you are right, although in most cases BP will still be up when casting PS in any event. You lose one tick, but if BP dropped you do 10% less damage during that time. This especially hurts if you delay PS and have nothing to fill the time with just to give BP that final tick. So aside from the inital applying of diseases it basically doesn't matter which order you use and this initial applying is connected to a range check in 95% of the cases, which favors IT.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Reading through the the different DPS threads blood seems to be quite on par with the other specs. Considering I don't have a single piece with ArP on it, would it be advisable to start collecting a set with lots of ArP on it. Is ArP that important for blood on gear or is sunders/raid buffs good enough?</div>

</div>Armor Penetration is for any DK spec worse than Strength, Hit and Expertise (last two until respective cap), but Blood gets most out of it of any spec. More information on stats weights can be found in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100124163826/http://elitistjerks.com/f47/t36638-death_knight_pve_dps/#Itemizing_as_a_Death_Knight" target="_blank">TTT - Death Knight PvE DPS</a>, although as far as I know this doesn't include the 3.1-buffs to ArP and Haste, yet.<br>
<br>
Questions like this are usually impossible to be answered, since they depend a lot on intemization points. That's saying strength is significantly better than ArP, but 2 Strength is worse than 10 ArP, so you always have to take a look at all stats on an item to determine its value. Basically, there's no point in focussing on ArP at the cost of significant Strength, Hit and Expertise (unless capped), but while taking that into account, ArP is the next most useful stat for a Blood DK.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Seems like, for me at least, that 7.5 is BiS, mainly because of the hit and avoidance I'll lose (1.07 Hit, 1.63 Dodge) for Defense (capped), Parry (.85), Expertise (8 points, already at 27) and Health.<br>
<br>
Am I dumb? Is the Parry and Health gain worth the big drop in Hit and Dodge?<br>

</div>Blood (if played with diseases) can usually let them drop for a few seconds, because their 10% damage boost doesn't depend on a disease. For Frost and Unholy it's very situational, 1-2 seconds are fine, if the dominant disease isn't on the target for longer than that the damage loss outweighs the extra tick you get.<br>
<br>
@edit<br>
<br>
It depends on  when the next FU after the 2B would refresh and how long the diseases have left when you are considering this. Since it's pretty much impossible to calculate all this in the split second you have to decide you can basically follow this rule: If your diseases are on their "last tick" and the next FU after the current one is more than ~4 seconds away, simply refresh, else use your respective FU ability. Just never delay your rotation because you can't decide what to do.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>It's not gonna be physical, there was some unclarity a while ago because SS did less damage than the tooltip suggested. At first it was assumed it was affected by armor since some of those numbers would make sense that way.<br>
<br>
But it turned out that blizzard forgot to update the tooltip. Its corrected now though, still ignoring armor.<br>
<br>
Armor Penetration is still a pretty bad stat for unholy. Only bloodstrike gets real benefit from it, which are 2 attacks per rotation. Also Plague strike once in a blue moon.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, unholy does benefit a bit more from haste. Since pets scale well with haste.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Yes, it has been (or rather is being) discussed in the threads for the respective specs, so you should find any information there. Although in many cases it's still very uncertain what are the optimal glyphs besides no-brainers like for example FS for any Frost spec. A lot of glyphs have theoretical values that are very close to each other and often depend on external circumstances, so for a reliable hierarchy we need larger sample sizes that only post-3.1 raiding delivers.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>There is no real best-in-slot set but there are such things as best-in-slot avoidance, threat, or stamina set. I'd imagine that it would be possible to form a best-in-slot for everything set but it would obviously not have as much avoidance as it could or have as much hit/exp as it could. What you want to do is form a set that generates enough threat so your DPS don't pull off you while maximizing avoidance, mitigation, and stamina.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Depends a lot on the fight i think.<br>
<br>
Both have advantages and disadvantages.<br>
<br>
The disadvantages of a priority system are:<br>
- They are generally harder to remember<br>
- They require more focus during a hectic fight, there is no auto-pilot so to say.<br>
- For some specs they are just too complicated, especially when you have a lot of procs. Frost with Rime, KM, cooldown attacks, etc. Can make it complicated.<br>
<br>
The advantages are though:<br>
- Usually higher dps if you can pull it off<br>
- More fun, because you're not /bored facerolling your keyboard but have to actively interact<br>
- They are easier to readjust once you mess up somewhere (the priority doesnt shift, so you just pick it up again)<br>
<br>
For unholy i really love a priority rotation, because its relatively simple, with the only real variable whether or not your SS glyph procs.<br>
For frost i found it to be quite hard, since you have to consider diseases, KM procs, Rime Procs, HB cooldown, combination of all those, combined with a lack of a lot of free GCD so you dont have time to think about it.<br>
<br>
So if you can pull it off, more power to you. It makes the class more interesting, allows potentially for higher dps and simply increases your skill.<br>
However normal rotations aren't as far off from priority rotations as most people think. <br>
A lot of steps in a priority rotaition are predictable, for example when to spend what runes on what. That basically forms a rotation.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<!-- message -->
		<div id="post_message_1176887"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I consider Priority and Rotation to be pretty much the same thing, as a Rotation is simply writing down what a Priority would otherwise lead you to cast anyway.<br>
<br>
In either case, I'd say that it doesn't particularly matter which you go for, as long as you understand <b>why</b>. Why put up diseases? Why cast Blood Strike ahead of an Oblit? Why cast Howling Blast instead of an Oblit if Killing Machine is up? What about if KM is not up?<br>
<br>
Being able to answer these questions in your head and in real-time is really the basis of a priority system: <i>Push whatever button gives you the best results at that instant.</i> <br>
<br>
Using a rotation means that you plan out which buttons to push ahead of time, but it's still important to remember the logic/math that goes on behind each step of the rotation so that you know which section of the rotation to resume to if and when you're forced out of melee range for whatever reason.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

(Note though, some of the specs you will see by just armourying people are pretty much terrible: for example, a few days ago I saw a tank-dk with 59 points in frost but only 2/5 KM (and no anticipation) - gear isn't even a good indicator, as this dk was in fully 25 man gear). <br>

Are you asking if 2pc + 4pc t7 &gt; 2pc t8 alone but &lt; 2pc + 4pc t8? whatever the exact question t7 4pc is probably better than both t8 bonusses.<br>
<br>
If you're asking if 2pc + 4pc + stats upgrade from t8 &gt; t7 with bonusses then i believe the answer is yes<br>

It's probably best to only break 4pc t7 till you have at least 2 pieces of t8, maybe even 4<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Does Improved Blood Presence add 5% of your total damage as healing, or 5% added to the amount already being healed?<br>
<br>
In other words, if I put two points into IBP, do I heal 14% of my damage dealt (4% +10%), or 4.4% (4% + 10% of 4%)?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1180568"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I was thinking about an easy and fast way to determine whether to add more dodge- or parry-rating. As the caps for both are at 47% and 88% for parry and dodge respectively, is it correct or at least close to reality to use the following formula:<br>
<br>
<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px">
	<div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom:0px"><img src="/web/20100306112238im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/chestnut/misc/code_html.gif" border="0"></div>

		width: 694px;

		text-align: left;
		overflow: auto">MyParry / ParryCap &gt; MyDodge / DodgeCap =&gt; Get more dodge-rating
MyParry / ParryCap &lt; MyDodge / DodgeCap =&gt; Get more parry-rating</pre>
</div>In the first case I would be closer to the parry-cap (relatively speaking) than to the dodge-cap, so it would be better to get more dodge-rating. In the second case it's just the other way around, so I should get more parry-rating.<br>
<br>
E.g. I am currently at about 23% dodge and 16% parry (according to my paperdoll). Therefore my formula would lead me to add more dodge-rating as<br>

</div>It's hard to say "this spec is easier to pull off than that one", since a lot of it comes down to personal preference. So I'll just give you some pointers:<br>
<ul><li>Diseaseless Blood is probably at the moment the easiest one to do (no offense intended to the players who use it), because you only have to manage 2 cooldowns and be pretty much done with it</li>
<li>Frost (Either UP-Icy-Touch or BP-Obliterate) deliver relatively good DPS even if you don't watch things like Killing Machine Procs, but only bloom to their full potential when you do that. And this requires some experience.</li>
<li>Unholy is pretty self-sustaining, as well, you don't have to watch any specific procs. Just try to not let your pet die and wait for FC-procs or things like Greatness before you summon the Gargoyle.</li>
<li>It very much depends on the weapon you have, before BoH you're probably best off with Unholy, if you have BoH probably Blood or 6xIT (due to lack of Heigan Sigil)</li>
<li>All of these are 2H-specs. As of now, DW-specs are still vastly overpowered, so if you have at least reasonably decent 1H-weapons, that would probably be your best bet. Because even if you suck at it, your DPS will still be competitive (not to say what they'll be if you don't suck at it).</li>

</div>I don't know if this statement is exactly true. We seem to be coming close to a solid DW DPS build (or a few) right here on EJ. It's just taking a bit of time but they are looking pretty good imo. But, I believe that if you don't have experience with DW/have a DW set already, it might just be best to go the 2H route.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I can't offer a definitive source, but i can assure you it's been like that since beta. It's also the reason why no one has even thought about a blood tank build with more than 50 points in blood, simply because aside from doing more dps (but not more threat) DRW doesn't do anything for a tank<br>

</div>This is because the set bonus is not 20% increased damage overall per disease, but rather 20% increased damage <i>from the disease modifier.</i> Come 3.1, each strike has a percent modifier based on the number of diseases you have on the target, as opposed to a flat number as it currently stands. That is what gets increased by 20%.<br>
<br>
I.e; On the PTR, SS gets 11% increased damage per disease. You simply increase that by 20%, meaning with t8 4p, you get  13.2% increased damage per disease. <br>
<br>
A decent bonus, sure, but not that amazing. Blizzard set the bar too high with tier 7, really.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Also stated in same conversation by same DK, there is some kind of synergy with using DK's of different specs together?<br>

		<!-- message -->
		<div id="post_message_1188547"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I have several questions about new frost tank (!) rotations in 3.1, but to make myself clear I'll need to list some <u>assumptions</u> and <u>rotations</u> first.<br>
<br>
<b>Assumptions</b>:<br>
<br>
1. Blood Boil needs only one disease (FF or BP) to do its maximum damage.<br>
2. Howling Blast's damage is increased if FF is on the target, because of Glacier Rot and Tundra Stalker.<br>
3. Howling Blast does not benefit from Plague Strike/Blood Plague on the target.<br>
<br>
If these assumptions hold, add these remarks:<br>
4. Use Glyph of Howling Blast to infect targets with FF<br>
5. No need to talent Epidemic, HB would refresh FF every 10sec rotation<br>
<br>
<b>Rotations:</b><br>
<br>
<i>AoE:</i><br>
<br>
Start: DnD -&gt; HC* -&gt; HB -&gt; BB<br>
Rotation 1: OB -&gt; BB -&gt; HB -&gt; BB<br>
Rotation 2: DnD -&gt; HB -&gt; BB   (or just repeat Rotation 1)<br>
*: Hungering Cold, with available RP, could be used to apply FF, the first HB would do more damage this way.<br>
<br>
<i>Single-target:</i><br>

Rotation 1: HB -&gt; OB -&gt; BS -&gt; BS<br>
Rotation 2: HB -&gt; OB -&gt; OB    (or OBx3 with Epidemic)<br>
<br>
<b>Questions:</b><br>
<ul><li>Are Assumptions (1 to 3) valid?</li>
<li>The AoE rotation seems less of a hassle than standard IT+PS+Pest, but could it do more damage? Note that it would most likely give more 'snap' threat. It also seems easier to weave in more DnDs during combat (using Morbidity). As far as I know, DnD is still the best threat-per-rune ability, even single-target.</li>
<li>For single-target threat, does a 1-disease Obliterate hit hard enough? Would IT+PS be better on single-target than HB?</li>
<li>For single-target threat, because of lack of IT (and therefore Glyph of Icy Touch) and a lot of multi-rune attacks, would this rotation generate enough RP? (Maybe take Scent of Blood to compensate? And Glyph of Frost Strike?)</li>
<li>Rime-procs (on Obliterate) would not allow for an HB immediately after, as it would screw the rotations. However, the HB in your next rotation would be free, allowing for another OB, which would be interesting in case of single-target. Would this be proper usage of Rime?</li>
</ul><br>

				Runes are the primary resource mechanic for Death Knights. It's a very new concept (somewhat) that can be compared to Energy. Runes have a set regeneration period, which is 10 seconds. A Death Knight starts with 2 Blood Runes (B), 2 Frost Runes (F) and 2 Unholy Runes (U).<br>
<br>
It was always assumed that Runes just had a pure 10 second regen time. This has proven to be false from various tests. The behaviour that has been noted is that after the first set of runes very often runes regen after 8 seconds. The current concensus is the following:<br>
<br>
Runes have a 10 second regen time. However, if you do not use your regenerated rune as soon as it comes up, it will activate a timer (up to 2 seconds, is the current theory) which will count as the Rune being used. Think of it like this:<br>
<br>
Time 	Ability 	Regen time 	Runes <br>
00:00:00	Icy Touch	 	BBFUU<br>
00:10:00	 	10s	BBFFUU<br>
00:11:50	Icy Touch	 	BBFUU<br>
00:20:00	 	8.5s	BBFFUU<br>
<br>
<br>
Because you waited 1.5s after the rune was available to use the second frost rune, it's regen time was reduced to 8.5s. Do note, if you wait longer than 2 seconds the above does not apply.

</div>Just to elaborate a bit on this:<br>
<br>
FotFF vs. MoT for 2H also depends a lot on spec. Frost specs have the advantage of their RP dump being a melee attack, thus proccing FotFF. With 6xIT-spec I need 19 seconds on live to get full stack, which is still longer compared to other classes, but not significantly (my Survival hunter needs 16 seconds). But 6xIT has as mentioned the FS-advantage, as well as being played in UP with an additional 15% haste. For this specc FotFF is in my epxerience strictly significantly better than MoT for any encounter currently ingame.<br>
<br>
Also, the problem is not "movement" as such, but more correctly "time where you can't dps". In the current game content there are just a few encounters where stacks actually drop off (fewer than I expected before I got the trinket). And 20 seconds of building-up-stacks of FotFF is still always strictly better than 20 seconds of MoT excluding the proc, so when comparing those two trinkets you have to take into account that at the beginning of that "time where you can't dps" MoT could just have procced, effectively wasting that 1k-AP-boost.<br>
<br>
Comparing those two trinkets from a theoretical point of view is near impossible and from personal experience I would say, that FotFF is strictly better than MoT for all encounters where you have 45 sec+ windows of dpsing.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>The only reason to use DS at the beginning to get the 10% AP buff immediately, which makes perfect sense. However, once that buff is up, you should never use DS unless you have at least 26 RP in order to maximize its damage from the glyph. Add DS to the end of rotation 1 to ensure 26RP, and then HS until you get 26 RP, DS, then HS until you're out of runes for rotation 2.<br>

In terms of EP vs Crypt Fever (even with 3.1 in mind):<br>
<br>
Is the 13% magic damage increase from EP multiplicative with the 30% disease increase from CF?<br>
<br>
What I'm getting at, is it feasible with 2 Unholy DK's in the raid for one to spec EP, and the other to spec CF and have 3 points to spare , without losing any DPS?</div>

<br>
I've tried to search the megathreads for why people are advocating just 1/2 Epidemic, but never found a satisfactory answer.<br>
<br>
As I understand it, 3.0.9 diseases were 12 seconds baseline, with another 6 seconds from 2/2 Epidemic, for an 18 second duration.<br>
<br>
In 3.1, they're 15 seconds baseline, with Epidemic still giving 3 extra seconds per point, so you only need 1 point to get an 18 second duration.<br>
<br>
Without going to deep into the math (although it would be great if someone can explain exactly), <b>people are recommending just one point because while you can squeeze an extra strike in the 15-18 second range, you're always going to have to refresh diseases within the 18-21 second range, is that correct?</b><br>
<br>
Secondly, that this 1/2 Epidemic assertion only applies to Blood and Frost. <b>Unholy will always benefit from the extra duration since that means legroom for your Scourge Strike Glyph to refresh your diseases without having to IT+PS again. Is that right?</b><!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Yes, in Blood and Frost that last tick would usually be clipped by applying diseases for the next rotation, so the benefit of the second point in Epidemic is non-existent for Blood and marginal for Frost, if there is any at all.<br>
<br>
You also correctly asserted the Unholy-situation - 3 seconds of disease time yield 1 additional SS, so the probabilty that diseases are not being refreshed by SS chaining decreases even more.<br>

God i cant understand you. Everything at the Retri elitistjerks forum is easy and understandable but the way Dk forum is, is just weird. Why do you post a blood frost and unholy dps topic. There must be 1 superiour so why keep talking about the other 2? Its just a mess for someone who wants to learn Dk to read through all this nonsense. "I use this rotation"    "I use that rotation". There must be 1 rotation for single dps for instance which is superiour to the rest.</div>

</div>Why is this a "must"? Since Paladin has three different Trees, each of them for another role to fill, you only got one choice when you decide to dps. So the choices to make when you want to dps are just a few.<br>
<br>
DKs on the other hand have three different trees, every tree designed to be used for dps or tanking. So there are a lot more choices to make, not to mention that one tree can be better with this gear, another one might be better with that gear. It's a lot more complicated.<br>
<br>
<br>
Anyways: I got another question. Since Blizzard loves Haste, lots of Ulduar-Loots seem to have much of it. I would like to know, which tree benefits the most from haste?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>It's a plus in my book.  Taunting Malygos cause he decided to eat a spark when it was 10 yards away from him was always so much fun. :P<br>
<br>
Anyway, the macro command you're looking for is /targetenemy.  You can also use /console targetNearestDistance [# of yards] to change the distance that this works at.<br>

</div>It doesn't matter, since the reduction is mutiplicative.  If you have, say, 65% damage reduction from armor, it doesn't matter if you say you have .35*.95 or .95*.35 damage taken; either way, it's 66.75% damage reduction (or another 5% with blade barrier for 68.4% damage reduction).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

God i cant understand you. Everything at the Retri elitistjerks forum is easy and understandable but the way Dk forum is, is just weird. Why do you post a blood frost and unholy dps topic. There must be 1 superiour so why keep talking about the other 2? Its just a mess for someone who wants to learn Dk to read through all this nonsense. "I use this rotation" "I use that rotation". There must be 1 rotation for single dps for instance which is superiour to the rest.

</div>The DK forum reminds me of that Stephen King story "The Mist" except even less entertaining.<br>
<br>
But enough QQ.  My simple question is, since its so hard to find anything here.  Whats the new tank spec?  I was frost/unholy (with 5 in blood) like everybody else but now that the talent trees got readjusted so much I don't trust my own judgement.  I MT in my guild 10 mans.  What do you guys recommend?<br>
<br>
Other simple question, for dual-spec, whats the new top dps spec?  and with the armor pen changes etc, have any stats changed value?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

DPS is the same way, right now it looks like it's blood -&gt; unholy -&gt; Frost but it's hard to tell since you know, everything you know about the class just changed four days ago. So I'd say the reason you can't find much info is because; no one is quite sure yet.

Just a simple question. I was wondering which legplates would work better for me: t7 or the one im wearing now.<br>
<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px">
	<div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom:0px"><img src="/web/20100223103438im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/chestnut/misc/code_html.gif" border="0"></div>

		height: 34px;
		text-align: left;
		overflow: auto">http://eu.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Arathor&amp;n=alyse</pre>
</div>The new one has some advantage: hit cap, more arm. pen., more ap but less crit.<br>
T7's advantage: more crit and second set bonus which is important i believe.<br>
Yes, I've done many tries on boss target dummy with the different legplates but still can't see which one does more dps for me.<br>
Could you please tell me which one befits me better?<br>
<br>
Thanks in advance.<br>

I pass lot of time reading and mumbling on all the spec posted in unholy/blood/frost/dw topics, but it is really hard to find an answer or the time to try everything... And like I sayd above the right answer is still not known.<br>
<br>
Personally I envy the "esay-build" paladins can use to maximaze their damage. There is only one build and only one rotation to do the "damage dealer job" at the top, after that, you have only to consider your gear and your latency/attention/skill in game.<br>
<br>
I hope one day there will be an answer for DKs too.</div>

</div>The very aspect you dislike about this class is the same one that many of us love about it. I hope that there is never a clear answer to "which is the top dps spec?", simply because the theorycrafting / etc. is half (or more) the fun of this game. Variety is the spice of life.<br>
<br>
And now a question: Is the Frost Fever from the Howling Blast glyph applied before or after the damage? (unfortunately the glyph has not appeared on our server last time I checked so I am unable to test this myself at this point)<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

The damage done seems about right even after the nerf death strike received too. With the sigil, hysteria, 3/3 bloody vengeance, 100 runic power, glyphed, 4%+ dmg, abom's might, might of mograine and blood gorged critting for 6.5k and getting a 2.5k heal.<br>

This is data I collected on a target dummy and it shows 60 landed death strikes and only 4 crits out of 60... that's 7% with what should be around 22%+ in my tank gear as it is.<br>
<br>
The damage done seems about right even after the nerf death strike received too. With the sigil, hysteria, 3/3 bloody vengeance, 100 runic power, glyphed, 4%+ dmg, abom's might, might of mograine and blood gorged critting for 6.5k and getting a 2.5k heal.<br>

With a few people dead and a lot of melee, it was a bit unsafe to have only the ranged group absorbing the Sonic Screech. It seems the melee getting parried may cause additional danger to the tank though, as either she has a thrash attack of somekind, or she can gain parry haste. We also had this happen at Ignis:<br>
<br>
20:19:33.604 Tank's Devastate(R5) was parried by Ignis the Furnace Master.<br>

		<div id="post_message_1203531"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I'm currently raising a DK and tanking my way through the 70's to get a good feel for it.  I plan to stay Unholy for tanking, as it is what I enjoy playing the most.  I do have a couple of questions that I can't seem to get a good, intelligent answer for when it comes to a few talents.<br>
<br>
<b>Virulence vs. Ravenous Dead</b><br>
<br>
I guess it pretty much comes down to STR vs. Hit.  STR seems to be the winner to me as nearly everything for DK benefits from raw STR.  I'm assuming the Hit can be gained from gear vs. talents.<br>
<br>
<b>Desecration vs. Wandering Plague</b><br>
<br>
I really like wandering plague, pretty much giving diseases the ability to crit and do aoe at the same time seems like a win win, yet I see many many unholy spec's skipping over this talent.  I have it now on my DK and it's coming it at about 5% of my damage when tanking.  Would the damage increase from Desecration be worth more?  Should I try to fit both in?<br>
<br>
<b>RP Issues</b><br>
<br>
I'm wondering if it's because I did not spec into Dirge, but it seems I have RP issues when tanking now.  Will Dirge help this quite a bit?  Should I worry about it too much? <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20090917021322im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":)" class="inlineimg"><br>
<br>
<b>Rotation</b><br>
<br>
I'm really anal about keeping diseases up, and trying not to use PS &amp; IT after the initial disease application.  Using Glyph of Disease and Pestilence, I usually use 1 Blood rune every rotation to refresh diseases, even on single target so I can use my FU runes on SS.  When AoE is needed, I start with DnD, PS -&gt; IT -&gt; Pest.  Then I follow up with SS spam filled with Pest -&gt; BB to keep blood runes on CD (using RP dumps as well).  I'll probably switch to IT -&gt; PS for initial attacks after I drop Baron of Rivendare.<br>

		<div id="post_message_1207334"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->It would be great if someone could check my math for the T8 set bonus, i am unsure if its correct because it seems i fail at math.<br>
<br>
The bonus increases our disease bonus damage by 20%. That means instead of 10% extra damage we gain 12% per disease for HS.<br>
<br>
Formulas:<br>
<br>
HS without T8 4p:<br>
<br>
w = ((Weapon Dmg / 2) + 368)<br>
d = ((w / 100) * 10) * 2<br>
<br>
damage per hearth strike = w + d<br>
<br>
Example, BoH with about 800 dmg average:<br>
<br>
w = 768 = ((800 / 2) + 368)<br>
d = 153 = ((768 / 100) * 10) * 2<br>
<br>
Result in 921 damage per strike.<br>
<br>
HS with T8 4p are the same formulas but instead of 10%, you use 12% in the second formula (d).<br>
<br>
w = 768 = ((800 / 2) + 368)<br>
d = 184 = ((768 / 100) * 12) * 2<br>
<br>
952 = w + d<br>
<br>
When comparing HS with T8 4p vs HS without T8 4p that means a dmg increase by 3.3% per HS. Is this correct?<br>
((952 - 921) / 921) * 100 = 3.36...%<br>

		<div id="post_message_1207950"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Is there a way to either:<br>
a)	Change the order Death Runes are used<br>
Or<br>
b)	Manually reset Death Runes to their original runes with a macro or something?<br>
<br>
I am doing the Blood Rotation:<br>
<br>
DS-IT-PS-HS-HS-dump<br>
HS-HS-DS-HS-HS-dump<br>
<br>
During one point in my Blood rotation I have the runes:<br>
Blood  -  Blood  -  Death(on refresh)  -  Death  -  Death(on refresh)  -  Death<br>
<br>
During a normal rotation this is fine because the Death runes refresh at different times so I can use them effectively.<br>
<br>
However, on trash mobs I often find they die at that specific spot in my rotation (I hate Murphy) so I end up with that rune pattern and none of them on cool down.<br>
<br>
When I start up the rotation again, it wants to use the 2 left most Death Runes first like:<br>
<br>
Blood  -  Blood  -  <font color="Silver">used</font>  -  <font color="Silver">used</font>  -  Death  -  Death<br>
<br>
This means that the 2 frost runes will refresh together and the 2 unholy runes will refresh together and that messes up my rotation.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately a slight change in rotation to:<br>
IT-DS-PS-HS-HS-dump<br>
Wait for runes-HS-HS-DS-HS-HS-dump<br>
<br>
Does not fix the problem within 1 rotation because of the way runes refresh on intervals of 10s rather than on 10s from last use.<br>
<br>
A change of the order Death Runes are used or to manually reset death runes would solve this rotation issue, any suggestions on how to do that?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>This is currently being discussed in the Frost DPS forum and the ruling is still out but personally I love it as a glyph both for tanking and for DPS as it makes for a simple rotation that is easy to carry out no mater what’s going on in the fight.<br>
For tanking it makes for great snap agro as well. There are a few varied rotations being used but the simplest is:<br>
<br>
Single target: HB&gt;OB&gt;BS&gt;BS&gt;OB&gt;OB&gt;OB weaving Frost Strikes throughout and hitting HB on procs or subbing in a HB instead of an OB to keep FF up.<br>
AoE: HB&gt;D&amp;D&gt;BB   HB&gt;OB&gt;BB&gt;BB and use FSs as you can.<br>
<br>
Right now I'm running a 17/51/3 dps spec in BP with this Glyph.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div class="intellitxt" id="post_message_1210773"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I'd like to get a definitive answer to the simple question:<br>
Is HB damage &gt; OB damage in a raid environment with 2H frost spec on single target? <br>
Meaning: ~200dps weapon, OB glyph, all buffs, (almost) all raid buffs present, all armorlowering debuffs on enemy, +13% debuff on enemy, a.s.o.. <br>
I'm wondering, because in the Frost 2H DPS thread there are so many feasible rotations discussed, and I see rotations like<br>
HB &gt; OB &gt; BS &gt; BS &gt; OB &gt; OB &gt; OB <br>
but other rotations with HB every 10 secs, too. I know, with HB glyph and only 3 points in Unholy, HB every 10 secs has its reasons.<br>
<br>
Last time I checked, HB was buffed for getting a 10 sec (now 8 sec), and was pretty close in damage to OB. Maybe I mix something up with KM procs, and DW spec, maybe OB was better all the time (for single target and 2H spec).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I see what you're saying I was assuming it worked like Garg and more RP generated while it was in effect meant a longer duration where, in fact, it burns all RP immediately and that determines the duration. So with RPM out of the 1st tier frost talents and the glyph my DRW would last 19 seconds. That doesn't really sound worthwhile on a 90sec cooldown.

		<div class="intellitxt" id="post_message_1215317"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->My simple question is.<br>
<br>
How important is the hit and expertise cap compared to some other stats?<br>
<br>
I'm trying to find the flaw on my dps, and i noticed today that even though I almost have every best in slot item for a blood DK, I'm still getting pawned by less geared DK, though I do have the rotation macroed and working very well. I managed to pull 3050 dps at the peak on the training dummy in Acherus (without any buffs other than horn of winter) when I swapped my gear around to give me 21 expertise (with talent, I'm blood specced) and 294 hit rating EXACTLY.<br>
<br>
Now I know the raid buffs will provide hit, but to achieve this, I had to swap my pants to use the riveted abomination leggins instead of either my T7.5 or legplates of double strikes. So I'm now officially capped in both stats, but I did lose somewhere else.<br>
<br>
Note that with some other gear, I ended with 27 experience of 400 hit rating, so there must be a middle ground and I think I got it.. but I'm tired of sucking in dps.<br>

</div>I found it for you.  Don't try to macro ability rotations and expect to do well.<br>
<br>
As far as your original question, just weight the stats appropriately against others and don't go over cap, there's no magic minimum value.  Look at the Blood DPS-specific thread in this forum for those values, just browse through recent pages until you find posts from Methods for some quick charts with numbers.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>And when your IT or PS misses or gets dodged, your whole rotation is jacked and you're wasting a bunch of runes on subpar abilities because you're using them all on a 1-diseased target.  Then when you use AMS and get to soak extra RP, you'll be wasting all the RP as you continue going through your 1-button-spam ability without properly RP-dumping the extra.  Or when DRW is coming up, you're continuing to DC throughout your rotation instead of waiting for it to build all the way up to 100 or 130 so you can pop a full DRW.  So on and so forth.

<br>
My main concern is when it becomes more beneficial to spam BB vs HS when DRW is out. Actually I'm not even sure when it's favorable when DRW <i>isn't </i>up. Unless there's just an absurd amount of mobs, I've been using HS. <br>
<br>
Also, and forgive me if this is a no brainer, but when you have all death runes up, do you bother reapplying diseases? <br>
<br>
This primarily happens to me as a trash pull ends or during some boss fights that require movement. I end a trash fight (or rotation during boss fights) and have full Death runes up and I wonder if I should just go HS (or BB) crazy on the next trash pull, or still take the time to reapply diseases (and wait the extra rotation for a HS x6 set).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
This build is the classic Scourge Strike build of the DW bunch.  This one uses Blood Presence to fire hard hitting attacks to go with the usual spells.  This build needs Haste so that it's rotations don't get too long.  Just avoid Armor Penetration which scales poorly due to so many attacks that ignore armor.  As a nice side effect, Plague Strike hits harder in this build than any other DW build.  This build has a very high scaling Death Coil as well.<br>

PS - IT - SS - BS - BS - Dump<br>
SS - SS - SS - Dump<br>
<br>
If you have the Scourge Strike Glyph, it should be auto-refreshing BP/FF on its own, so you go over to SS - SS - BS - BS - Dump - SS - SS - SS - Dump if you're lucky (a.k.a. the priority system kicks in).<br>

D&amp;D, Howling Blast, Blood Boil, Pestilence, and Heart Strike would all ruin CC. To the best of my knowledge, unless it explictly states otherwise in the tooltip (i.e. Wandering plague), they would hit CCed targets.<br>
<br>
@HotieDraeni<br>
The rotation you listed seems to have an extra blood rune left over. PS&gt;IT&gt;SS&gt;BS&gt;<b>BS</b>&gt;UB&gt;DC would use it. Also, the rotation would depend on single target vs aoe. <br>
<br>
Single Target<br>
PS&gt;IT&gt;SS&gt;BS&gt;BS&gt;UB&gt;DC<br>
SS&gt;SS&gt;SS&gt;RDP<br>
SS renewing Diseases would dictate next rotation<br>
<br>
AoE<br>
D&amp;D&gt;PS&gt;IT&gt;Pest&gt;UB<br>
SS&gt;SS&gt;BB&gt;...BB? <br>
The secon rotation is hard to say because you know have a Death Rune (from Pest) and a Blood Rune from D&amp;D. This won't be back on track until another rotation. You could just drop out another BB, or you could grab Frenzy and use the DR there. <br>
<br>
I think the bigger concern is 1/3 Morbidity on a build bragging about how well DC scales. Also, I'd be concerned about using D&amp;D without Subversion. At any rate, I would ignore the "avoid ArP" on anything that uses so many physical attacks. Would it rely on ArP as much as, say, Blood? No, but ArP would still be welcome on all that BS/PS/SS you're delivering (and for BCB unless I'm mistaken).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Will you expand on your reply to HotiDranei a bit?<br>
<br>
You say "SS renewing Diseases would dictate next rotation."<br>
<br>
So if SS DOES renew Diseases, then...<br>
And, if SS DOES NOT renew Diseases, then...<br>
<br>
I realize these concepts are basic Unholy information, but I'm just learning.<br>

4) Melee easily, you get very little damage from spells.<br>

I assumed that was the way to work, but quite frankly, I had to ask because I've done tons of mistakes in the past.<br>

And I'm now convince FoFF is responsible for a lot of dps loss on high movement fights and that you are right on this.. I'll swap it on fights like Hodir and use it only for XT-002, Ignis and Kologorn for example... and see what happens.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Why do people keep linking this thread every time someone asks a question about armor pen? GC didn't cover the cap's interaction with armor penetration DEBUFFS and didn't say whether it's possible to ignore more armor than this cap.   Therefore that thread is only half useful for armor pen simulation. I've read it multiple times trying to read deep into what was said (e.g.  "we multiply the percentage in the tooltip times the minimum of the two values: the cap, and the amount of <b>armor on the target after all other modifiers</b>"), but it just doesn't give enough information to form a flawless formula for armor pen as it applies in a raid environment.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>There are a ton of posts on this (500+ when I searched for unholy presence), so I'll go ahead and explain the short version.<br>
<br>
Blood Presence is pretty much always better than Unholy Presence. Your white attacks are basically a wash comparing the two-- 15% stronger vs. 15% faster amounts to the same overall damage. For special attacks, Unholy Presence can only be better if you are able to do more attacks in the extra time to make up the difference in damage (15% stronger attacks in Blood vs. the same number of weaker attacks for Unholy). For most specs, this isn't possible. So, your friend is wrong-- that dead time he's getting through faster rune attacks is effectively a waste of damage. In fact, the runes favor Blood Presence. Read up on the 2 second buffer, and you'll see why you don't need to always use runes the moment they're available.<br>
<br>
I only use Unholy Presence for fights where movement and control is more important than absolute max dps-- there are a couple of these.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Rawr or another sim tool can answer this question easily, but Mirror is better.  Note Mirror is about 84 crit and 150ish AP, so 84 crit is better than 40 AP.<br>

		<div id="post_message_1223591"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Personally, I prefer to stand in the front, right on top of the main tank. That way, when I taunt off of him, the boss won't swing around wildly and screw up our positioning. Getting extra RS's doesn't matter, as you will immediately assume the MT's threat once you taunt.<br>
<br>
I find it very difficult to ever use a rotation when tanking, or even while dpsing. You should, as a rule, always use whatever tool will keep the mobs off the other players and keep you alive. Generally, this means using DnD on every cooldown, unless there are only two mobs, in which case HS is a better choice. you always want to have diseases ticking on everyone, so if they're about to go off, re-pest, and so forth.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

At the moment I run around with wrathstone and Mark of Norgannon (to get expertise capped), anyways, I got an upgrade some days ago (which I can't remember what part, just that it got expertise.) which brought me to 30 expertise, which is too much.<br>

Today I got the Nobles Deck trinket so I have a dilemma:<br>
Do I want to replace the wrathstone or the Mark of Norgannon? If I replace the mark I suddenly am at 22 expertise, which is below the cap, but I still want to know if it's a dps loss to replace the 4 expertise below cap with a nearly 200 ap increase from the nobles deck or should I just wait until I get more expertise from somewhere (like t8 chest.) and replace the wrathstone with the greatness trinket meanwhile?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1227438"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Alright well I'm not really sure if this goes here or in the Death Knight Tanking Discussion guide but I believe my question is rather simple and straightforward so I'll post it here. I'll try to get straight to the point, I am in a guild that is currently progressing through both Ulduar 25man and 10man. I am currently one of the maintanks of my guild alongside a DK tank.<br>
<br>
Now, the reason I am posting here is because I've noticed that for bosses that require taunting have been becoming immune to my taunts [Razorscale, Kologarn]. I thought the first time it was just a fluke, but it's been happening a lot lately so i've decided to investigate what the problem is. Turns out, the other MT DK has been using dark command and death grip <b>every time they are off the cooldown</b>, thus causing the diminishing taunt returns on bosses to take effect. I have confronted him about it and he has dismissed my complaints as "QQ" and "let me play the way I want to" and he claims the taunts cause threat. I asked my guild leader to address the issue and when he did the DK tank said that every one of his abilities were bound to taunt, and when we tried explaining that he doesn't need to taunt when the boss is attacking him to maintain threat he again dismissed it. We even pointed out that on the tooltip it says "Commands the target to attack you, <b>but has no effect if the target is already attacking you</b>" and again dismissed it as just QQ by me. This is becoming a serious issue because the bosses are becoming immune to my taunts, which has caused wipes/deaths, and I am getting blamed [by him] that I "don't know how to taunt". I believe that I am right in the assumption that taunting only brings your threat up to the amount of the person highest in threat+a but doesn't do anything when the target is attacking you but I have never played a DK nor do i know the tanking mechanics of dks so i'd like some input on this situation. I have glanced over some of the DK tank discussion topics and have not seen anything about taunting being in a rotation. Thank you for your help, he claims to come to this site often as well so I don't know where he got this idea from.<br>
<br>
Note for above: For my example, Razorscale, you may be thinking that he just used his taunts a lot on adds, but I can assure you he uses them on bosses when they are attacking him. Another example would be Archavon, where he used a combined total of about 15-27+ taunts on the boss [roughly]. I am not exaggerating in the slightest, recount has shown this to be true. [I believe it shows it under damaging attacks by the target, or something of that nature, all of his taunts are shown to be "immune" as well.]<br>
<br>
Also, one more quick question. He is also saying that "Cloak of the Iron Council" is and upgrade over "Cloak of the Shadowed Sun". I know SBV is useless for DKs but he claims that the expertise is the reason why. Is the 26 expertise on this cloak that big of a stat upgrade over the extra armor, defense, and dodge rating?<br>
<br>
Again, thanks for your help and sorry for that wall of text heh.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Turns out, the other MT DK has been using dark command and death grip <b>every time they are off the cooldown</b>, thus causing the diminishing taunt returns on bosses to take effect.

</div>You are definitely right. Neither Dark Command nor Death Grip cause threat per se, and Dark Command definitely has no effect if it's already attacking you, as the tooltip reads. Death Grip will force the target to attack you for three seconds (and acts as a taunt as well), but it's still usually pointless to use it if you're already the target.<br>
<br>
Using Dark Command on cooldown will definitely make the boss taunt immune within a few uses. Your friend needs to study up on how taunt works.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Try weaving your Frost Strikes into your rotation. It makes better use of your KM procs and smooths out your rotation a little. Something like:<br>
IT &gt;PS &gt;OB &gt;(FS) &gt;BS &gt;BS &gt; RP dump &gt;OB &gt;(FS) &gt;OB &gt;(FS) &gt;OB &gt;(FS)<br>
<br>
DPS wise your best bet is to stick to your rotation and keep your diseases up rather then letting them drop off in favor of the extra OB.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I used to be not hit capped as well for a couple of weeks (around 7,5 %) and I missed around 15 - 20 times during a whole Naxxramas raid, which is odd. Imagine these 15 - 20 hits being HS/ DS crits at around 10k (i. e. 150.000+ damage loss). Now project this on her TPS and you/ she should know if she can afford being not hit capped. I at least don't recommend it.<br>

Currently i am trying to run the rotation PS-IT-SS-HS-HS-UB(for dump) then SSx3 then dump..........problem is, SS seems to have a slow cool down on the second rotation. Is my rotation correct? Or is a gear or gem issue? This is the main rotation, i am also using Gargoyle and that stuff as well. Would appreciate any and all info or help!!!!

<br>
I believe this is still accurate for 3.1.  Rune Tap is only going to generate half of what it heals in threat and that is assuming there are no adds around to further diminish this number.  Also it's on, at best, a 30 second cooldown, and is subject to overhealing (i.e. if you use Rune Tap when you are at full health, no threat is generated).  I can't imagine any scenario in which that would be better at generating threat than Heart Strike.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Because of the Singed debuff the Toasty Fires place on Hodir, Frost and Unholy scale much, much better than Blood for that fight. It's my personal experience that Frost beats out Unholy, just because of higher crit rates on it's biggest hitting attack, larger crit multipliers and the nature of Frost Strike being more spammy than Scourge Strike (especially if you time AMS right).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Because of the Singed debuff the Toasty Fires place on Hodir, Frost and Unholy scale much, much better than Blood for that fight. It's my personal experience that Frost beats out Unholy, just because of higher crit rates on it's biggest hitting attack, larger crit multipliers and the nature of Frost Strike being more spammy than Scourge Strike (especially if you time AMS right).</div>

</div>Thanks!  I was also considering the possibility that the scourge strike dual wield build might out-scale 2H builds because of its scaling with haste.  Would that outweigh the scaling from crit that frost would receive or am I simply mistaken believing that DW builds would benefit more from haste?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Is there is gear limit where unholy becomes better at AOE tanking or do you need a higher avoidence to make this worthwhile.  I gather this was the case before the last patch but then i lost track of the conversation and now i'm lost. <br>
<br>
The fireside chat about tanking is all about ulduar and I've not even started raids yet.<br>

For Naxx and pre-raid (heroics), regardless of tree, I highly recommend picking up Morbidity 3/3 and the Death and Decay glyph - this will make your life as a tank much, much easier.  Frost has high avoidance, better damage reduction, and good AOE; Blood has high health, self-healing, and great single-target threat; Unholy with UB and cascading magic-reducing cooldowns make aoe threat and magic tanking pretty simple.  Though the hard-core tanking pundits down in Suno's Fireside chat will argue fiercely that one tree is better than another, I'm a firm believer that it all comes down to preference, playstyle, and skill, and that all trees are more-or-less equal, depending on the circumstances.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div class="intellitxt" id="post_message_1231842"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Hello... long time reader (of the mage forums) and first time poster (anywhere)...<br>
<br>
THE SITUATION:  Basically... I can't really PLAY the game right now because of a graphics issue in my computer, but I'll be replacing it soon.  In the interim, I've been reading gobs and gobs about the game as a form of either masochism or hedonism, I'm not sure which.  Anyway, short story long, I rerolled recently on a new server, and once I get up to 80, I plan to I use my DK as a farming tool--grinding out food for myself, skinning the remains, etc.  As such, I'm looking for "THE BEST" aoe grinding spec.  Not necessarily for leveling, although I'm sure that this minor discrepancy wouldn't really make any difference in the spec itself.<br>
<br>
I'm looking at a blood spec, but not for any raiding meter-watching purpose... so I thought this would be the most apt place to put this.  The thing is, I only have very minor experience with the DK at this point, so I'm not even really solid about what my rotations would even be.  Does anyone have any suggestions as to what the best aoe grind spec is?  Does the "standard" B/UH spec listed on the "There Will Be Blood" thread hold strong for this purpose? <br>
<br>
Sorry for the complete noobery in this question, and thank you for polite responses.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100701140807im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":)" class="inlineimg"><!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div class="intellitxt" id="post_message_1231851"><!-- google_ad_section_start --><b><u>Blood AoE grinding:</u></b><br>
<br>
The rune-rotation you could use for Blood AoE is:<br>
Death and Decay -&gt; Icy Touch -&gt; Plague Strike -&gt; Pestilence (now you're out of runes)<br>
Death Strike -&gt; Blood Boil -&gt; Death Strike -&gt; Blood Boil (out of runes again)<br>
Blood Boil times 6 (using Pestilence and possibly the Glyph of Disease to refresh diseases)<br>
<br>
Blood Boil would be your best AoE-attack, but note it takes 20 seconds already to get to the "Blood Boil times 6" part, as you have to convert runes (using Death Strike) to Death Runes. An added advantage of using Death Strike is that you regain health -&gt; lower downtime.<br>
<br>
If you would spec 50/0/21, you would be able to pick up Unholy Blight, which would help at AoE-grinding.<br>
<br>
<b><u>Frost AoE grinding:</u></b><br>
<br>
The rotation I use for AoE-tanking and grinding:<br>
Death and Decay -&gt; Howling Blast -&gt; Blood Boil<br>
Death Strike/Obliterate -&gt; Blood Boil -&gt; Howling Blast -&gt; Blood Boil<br>
<br>
The Glyph of Howling Blast is very important here. It infects all targets with Frost Fever, allowing Blood Boil to get its 1.5x modifier (it only needs 1 disease up for max damage).<br>
<br>
The advantages of this spec are:<br>
- No need to spread diseases using Pestilence, Howling Blast (Glyphed) infects targets with FF<br>
- Easy rotation<br>
- A lot of AoE-damage at the start. Notice you can use Deathchill (guaranteed crit, on all targets) with Howling Blast for some insane damage. Killing Machine procs also serve you very well.<br>
<br>
<br>
I don't know enough about Unholy to elaborate.<br>
<br>

</div>Unholy and blood are both fine and probably really close to equal for leveling. For the most part you want to try to whenever possible to pull as many mobs as you can and just kill things with aoe, and unholy is definitely better at aoe. I also liked unholy because a big part of leveling is travel time and you improve both your mount(on a pale horse) and movement(unholy presence) speed as unholy. I preferred unholy presence so I could get damage out faster, you'll usually kill a lot of mobs before you can use all 6 runes in blood presence, in unholy though you can usually get everything off and a rune ability or two, aoe pulls are also much easier when you can get your diseases up and spread quicker.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">What is currently the best rune for Frost DPS?(Not BiS geared, no XT-sigil)<br>
Some people say FC is the best until at least you get XT-Sigil, and some say razorice is the best all the way.<br>
Can i get some clarification about this? thanks</div>

</div>I'm fairly certain that FC beats Razorice in almost all scenarios. I'm not entirely sure why, but my guess would be that it has to do with the great deal of target swapping that any DPS class has to do in Ulduar. All fights except for Ignis and Vezax have some adds/target swap component to them and Razorice, being a stacking DEbuff, can't compete nearly as well in those situations as FC. <br>
<br>
Finally, if you don't have the Sigil, there's no point in speccing frost at the moment. You will get MUCH more mileage out of Unholy.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Yes, you were testing the viability of a RAID spec against a TARGET DUMMY. It's an inherently flawed comparison, as the dummies are almost always in execute range, assume ideal conditions, have exactly 0 AoE component, no debuffs/buffs etc. etc. I could go on, but you get the point. <br>
<br>
Furthermore, what you "enjoy" and what is actually effective are very often two completely different things. If you're looking for a spec that's fun then by all means, spec Frost without the sigil. But you will do significantly (in the range of 10-20%) less DPS than if you had picked a spec that is better suited to your current gear availability.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>What is important to remember is you are playing a game, hopefully to have some fun.  Even if you have the potential to do 500 dps more with Unholy in a raid buffed setting, it seems better to spec Frost since you said you enjoy it more and you seem to understand the rotation for Frost better.  Also people usually perform better when they enjoy what they are doing.<br>
<br>
Now if you were in a top tier guild and you may get gkicked for 500 dps less than you should be doing, that is a different story, but I don't think you have to worry about that.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I have been searching for gear with +str stats, but have noticed that most of the gear that has +str is geared towards tanks (defense rating, dodge rating, parry, etc.). <br>
What would be the next best stat to chase? AP? AGI? Or is it better to take the +str gear with the extra tanking enchants/stats or go after gear that doesn't have +str but has the dps enchants/stats?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div class="intellitxt" id="post_message_1235822"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Probably not. There are a few instances where tank gear can come close to competing with DPS gear, but they are few and far between. <br>
<br>
If you don't run Ulduar, check out the following list of pre-3.1 gear that has strength on it and try to pick of some of it: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100620151155/http://www.wowhead.com/?items=4.4&amp;filter=ub=6;cr=20:42:45:46:82;crs=1:3:3:3:2;crv=0:0:0:0:0;gb=1;wt=20;wtv=1#chest:0-2-17+1" target="_blank">Plate Armor - Items - World of Warcraft</a>.<br>
<br>
As far as secondary stats go, it depends heavily on your spec. Frost gets a lot of mileage out of crit and Blood goes ape-shit for Armor Penetration (I'm not entirely sure what Unholy likes, but I imagine you can find it on these forums somewhere). You should always be hit-capped and either at or just under the expertise soft cap, so aim to pick up gear that helps you meet either of those criterion.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I am pretty familiar with DKs at this point, but on my current one I am playing with Blood DPS for the first time. The raw stat values from Pene look very promising to stack heavily (once hit/exp capped of course). I was wondering though, is there any kind of cap on pene? Can you keep stacking it forever (granting actually negative armor, like in WC3)? I understand that reaching levels that high is probably impossible with in game gear, but it seems to me far more likely that pene has some soft caps associated with it. I have heard rumors about caps associated with sunder and expose, and would like to know if there is a practical level at which stacking pene stops granting a significant dps increase.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div class="intellitxt" id="post_message_1236378"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I've currently working through 10 man Ulduar content and I've been looking through Rawr to see what kind of gear upgrades I should be looking for. Something I have noticed and have read about is that Blood scales amazingly well with Ulduar gear upgrades while Unholy (Which I currently am) barely gets much increase based on what Rawr shows me. I should mention that in my current gear, when I swap from Unholy spec to Blood spec in rawr, it is supposedly way more dps in the first place.<br>
<br>
However, a lot of sources have said that Unholy is still the top dps spec post 3.1 but based on what I see on Rawr, I'm left scratching my head on what to believe. While I have no qualms about switching over to Blood, I'm still curious how exactly does Unholy stay at the top? Do you need BiS gear from H Ulduar or is there just something Rawr can't calculate based on theory that states why Unholy is still top or is Rawr just not that accurate when it comes to actual raid performance?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>This is wrong if you are Unholy, which both he and you are.  See the Unholy thread for more specific discussion.  The most recent specific numbers in there are from a post by Methods in mid-April, when he said "Difference = ~23 DPS in favor of Awareness WITH T7 (T8 = no contest and Awareness wins by far)."  There are some later posts agreeing with that.<br>
<br>
The blue sigil is pretty weak, so I'd imagine VH is better until you get Awareness, but I haven't run numbers or anything to confirm that.  Not that it matters, though, you can buy Awareness with Emblems of Valor now, you don't need to farm Naxx for it.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Hi guys, I found this comment by Pyros in Suno's thread. It was accepted by the thread as fact but I can't find any links to where this is shown in testing or math (even google has failed me)? Does anyone have the link or know which thread it took place in? <br>
<br>
Failing a link to something I can read what I'm looking for is some validation on the spell deflection working on AE's comment. I know it worked on dragons breath, but would it work on something like a mage's blast wave or blizzard spell? How about Saph's blizzards? <br>
<br>
Its possible that I'm just fundamentally misunderstanding something about spell types which is making the operation of this talent hard for me to understand?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div class="intellitxt" id="post_message_1237812"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->ok so i have been having troubles with my Frost rotation lately.<br>
Im currently 17/51/3, glyphed for IT,FS,OB, w/o 4 pc t7<br>
<br>
I was using this rotation:<br>
<br>
IT&gt;PS&gt;OB&gt;BS&gt;BS&gt;FS dump<br>
IT&gt;PS&gt;OB&gt;OB&gt;FS dump<br>
<br>
however, SOME people are saying that this rotation is more appropriate w/o the 4 pc set bonus and with IT glyph<br>
<br>
IT&gt;PS&gt;OB&gt;BS&gt;BS&gt;FS dump<br>
OB&gt;OB&gt;IT&gt;IT&gt;FS dump OR OB&gt;OB&gt;OB&gt;FS dump.<br>
<br>
I was informed that the 2IT rotation gives me the RP i am missing from the 4 pc t7 set. Tbh, i tried going back and forth with this rotation and my original and i cant pin point just yet which one does better due to the unpredictable trinket/frost procs. In regards to the 3OB rotation, i find it hard to fire a 3rd OB w/o my diseases falling off. Going UP for the sake of 1 more OB in a rotation was not a choice of mine.<br>
<br>
My only concern with my original rotation is that everytime i refresh my diseases on the 2nd part, i still have about 2-3 sec left on my current diseases. So i dont know if thats a bad thing<br>
<br>
So can anyone give me a clarification on which rotation works best w/o the 4 pc set bonus? Thanks<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I haven't posted any actual testing screens or whatever, I did run a few tests post 3.1 to find out if it was still worth taking. The first few tests were simply getting a mage to cast Arcane Missiles on me(chanelling spell, can absorb any of the ticks) and Cone of Cold(non targetted AE, can absorb). After that I set up a MSBT alert on procs to see how often and on what it'd proc in Ulduar. It doesn't proc on Hodir Frozen blow melee attack, on Plasma Beam, on Fusion Punch. It does proc on kologarn eye beam, on YS green beams, on mimiron Heat Wave(tick based), on mimiron barrage(but you still die ^^), on mimiron bomb bots etc. I haven't tested your particular questions, but it works on Sif's blizzard on thorim hardmode so I'd bet it works on all blizzard types, and blastwave is probably not any different. The 9% is simply 20%(your parry in tanking gear) chance to proc 45%reduction averaged.<br>
<br>
It's in my opinion a pretty solid talent, even though it's RNG so it might work on useless stuff and fail on good stuff. In a PvP setting, that'd be absorbing a tick of a fireball but not the fireball itself ^^.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
Armory may not be updated with my tanking gear as I was PvPing earlier, but base threat statistics are 8.5% expertise with 7.5% melee hit (raid buffed) and my primary tanking weapon is <a id="itemlink" class="q4" style=" font-weight: bold;" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100620151155/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=45498" target="_blank">[Lotrafen, Spear of the Damned]</a> + Stoneskin Gargoyle.<br>

Firstly: For a standard Unholy main-tanking build (below) - What would be more beneficial between 3/5 Dark Conviction and 2/2 Two-Handed Weapon Specialization plus 1/5 Dark Conviction purely based on a maximum TPS standpoint.<br>

No Ebon Plaguebringer because I'm not the only unholy DK in the raid and the debuff overlap is rarely if ever needed.<br>

</div>I remember mention once when I was testing out Unholy awhile back that I asked the other death knight why his damage was so disproportionately lower that night than previous. He replied that my Ebon Plague interfered with his, meaning he lost a portion of damage (Perhaps due to not having a third registered disease) - Which is why I didn't go down to it. I merrily assumed that Crypt Fever and Ebon Plague could be applied at the same time, but two Ebon Plagues could not. Considering I had talents that gave similar benefits (At least in the way of Dark Conviction) while not overlapping two Ebon Plagues which may still cause issues I partially assumed it would be more benefit for the raid group overall if I didn't spec into Ebon Plaguebringer so the debuffs wouldn't overlap.<br>
<br>
Of course it might have been him slacking, but he's the ex-First Scarab Lord of my server so I trusted in what he said - Admittedly that was pre-3.1 so things may have changed since then. If that is infact the case I may well just throw all 3 into Ebon Plaguebringer then and it would immediately answer my question - Failing that, I supppose in hindsight looking at my question Two-Handed Weapon Spec's 4% two-handed damage would beat 2% crit purely based on the fact that (Unless I'm mistaken) disease crits can't tick so they gain nothing from either talent, Unholy Blight can't crit so that gains nothing from either talent and that leaves almost predominantly strikes which gain benefit from both but with a double-hit from two-handed wep spec. Of course it doesn't factor in increased damage from critical strikes nor does it factor in Death and Decay or Icy Touch crits, both skills which are not effected by two-handed wep spec.<br>
<br>
At least I learned not to judge a book by it's cover on first glance, I can honestly say I completely overlooked the crit bonus in Ebon Plaguebringer though.<br>
<br>
As for the glyph advice, I was erring on both glyphs too. I've almost never raided without my Rune Strike glpyh but there are so many more options for Unholy than Frost which is where my confusion came in.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Anyway I can look up the spec easily but the rotations have me baffled.  I always thought OB did more dmg than FS but apparently looking at the crit numbers I had last night (17-19k for FS) it seems like that isn't the case.  Does that mean I should prioritize FS instead of OB whenever it is available?  Maybe I was doing something wrong but it seems like during last night's run my runic power was always capped.  I was used to Unholy doing 2 disese (IT, PS) then OB OB BS BS FS FS FS FS and start the cycle again.  Is this wrong?  I'm just used to it w/ the unholy build but if people know any better please advise.  <br>

		<div class="intellitxt" id="post_message_1238416"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->As Frost, Oblit without the new sigil will generally do more damage than Frost Strike (it depends a little on your group comp, especially for 10mans). Once you get the sigil, though, FS will be doing a LOT more damage than Oblit. However, this doesn't mean that you should always FS whenever you have the RP to do so. You should only use FS if you meet any of the following criteria:<br>
<br>
(1) All your runes are on cooldown.<br>
(2) You have a Killing Machine proc.<br>
(3) You are or will be RP capped if you use a runic attack.<br>
<br>
Otherwise it's more DPS to use your runes and then FS while they recharge. The only possible exception to this is if they boss is VERY close to dying (&lt;3%), in which case you want to spam your highest damage attack as much as possible.<br>
<br>
It's still up in the air as to whether or not 1 disease or 2 disease is a superior spec. At this point, I think it's largely fight dependent and you will probably see very similar results with both of them, assuming you can master each of their unique playstyles.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Otherwise it's more DPS to use your runes and then FS while they recharge. The only possible exception to this is if they boss is VERY close to dying (&lt;3%), in which case you want to spam your highest damage attack as much as possible.<br>
<br>
It's still up in the air as to whether or not 1 disease or 2 disease is a superior spec. At this point, I think it's largely fight dependent and you will probably see very similar results with both of them, assuming you can master each of their unique playstyles.</div>

Thanks for the quick response.  I have the sigil from XT maybe that is why i'm seeing larger numbers from FS.  Other questions I have is should I glyph for HB or go for IT?  Or maybe that is dependent on whether I play 1 disease or 2.  I'll glyph for IT and go for 2 diseases.  Should I HB whenever Rime procs?  That does cost me a GCD so I was wondering if it is worth it.  As it is now I always have some button to press whether it is OB or FS or BS but there doesn't seem to be any downtime and I just feel like I have more runic power than I can spend.  I'm running in Blood btw maybe i can try it with Unholy presence instead maybe that'll change things.  <br>
<br>
For now I'll just go similair path with Unholy and replace DC with FS and SS with OB?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>You have the right idea, 1 disease with HB, 2 with IT. <br>
<br>
I play frost in Unholy Presence with the IT glyph, since I've found that I'm almost always GCD capped in some form in Blood Presence. There's just too much to do with a 130 RP cap and a 32 RP high damage attack. In UP, I generally HB on every Rime proc, as the extra damage can't hurt (so long as my runes are on cooldown and I'm not RP capped). <br>
<br>
As a general rule, you can replace DC with FS and SS with OB, but it'll end up being a different in practice. Your disease will be 3s shorter, so you'll have to renew them more often and OB won't refresh their duration. FS is a much more spammy move than DC as well, so you'll find that you're dumping RP a lot more often that you were with Unholy.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Glyph for IT.  If you are running a two disease rotation then FF application from HB would be a waste.  The extra runic power generated from the IT glyph will provide you with a few extra FS over the course of a boss battle.  Save the rime proc for when your runes are down when possible.  Priority wise it should be low priority to use the rime proc, unless you are AOE'ing.  Definitely use blood presence, the 15% loss in damage will hurt you on the meters. If the rotations feel tight, it's because you're not used to them yet.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>This is flat out not true. It varies widely on a fight to fight basis, as you can tell by looking through the Wowmeter boards. <br>
<br>
Personally, I've found Unholy Presence to generally be better DPS than Blood, just because my RP generation is so high with Glyphed IT and the abundance of magic damage present in Ulduar. I tend to gain about 200-300 RP from AMS alone on any given fight and I have nowhere near the GCDs to use it all in Blood Presence. <br>

</div>On a given raid night for me, two ITs will hit for about 5804 and generate 50 RP. Oblit will hit for an average of 6890 and generate about 25 RP. So you can see that by using IT instead of OB, you lose about 1k damage and gain 25 RP. This runic power gain EASILY offsets the loss of damage, resulting in a net DPS gain.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

In a 20 second rotation I auto attack five times, compared to heart strike's six and death strike's 2. These numbers just seem a bit out of wack.<br>
<br>
I suppose my question, after all that, is why is my white damage so high? My DPS seems to match my gear so I'm not too concerned. But I also don't want to be sitting idly by while there is some DPS to be had.<br>

</div>Your white damage is so high because you are using a shitty macro. Learn how to run the rotations correctly and manually and you should see your DPS go up as your % of white damage goes down.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div class="intellitxt" id="post_message_1240275"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Castsequence-macros never yield the same DPS as actually learning the rotation and being proficient at it yourself. Although a Blood spec at a Patchwerk-like fight might be the sole exception to this, since you really can't do a lot wrong there - if you are expertise capped.<br>
<br>
Which you are not. Which isn't terribly bad unless you are using a castsequence macro. As you can see you missed more than 8% of your Heart Strikes, which is your main nuke in Blood. If you do the rotation yourself you just HS again, if you use a macro the HS ist lost. So using a macro yields inefficient use of abilities, therefore the percentage of white damage increases (since you can't mess up a lot there). If you think 4k DPS is a lot for your gear status, imagine what heights you would be able to reach if you actually pushed more than one button.<br>
<br>
Also, 27% is closer to one quarter than one third, I think usually white DPS jumps between 20 and 25% for Blood.<br>
But seriously, I'd recommend you don't even start using cast sequence macros. They might not be terribly shitty in Naxx, but as content progresses it will probably progress without you, since the DPS gap only increases as encounters become more versatile and difficult. Also, Blood rotation isn't very hard to learn.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Well this really does depends on your raid composition.  Are you running 25 or 10?  If you're running 10 and you're caster heavy then being unholy would be more beneficial because of the 13% magic debuff.  If you're melee heavy then frost would be more beneficial.  In 25 man I'm pretty sure you're half melee and half caster so you'd most likely benefit the raid more with a haste benefit for the melee.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Most likely not.  Point is even if you can take points away from it why would you?  Where would you put those points in instead?

</div>Get sigil of awareness from badges and that'll up your dps by alot.  By looking at your gear it seems like you have alot of gold to spare (bracers, greatness, boes) but not enough time to raid.  Try and raid some naxx and get better equipments.  You're way over hit capped so maybe a change of gear can help?  Just have to practice with the rotation and your dps will pick up.  Make sure to have the proper addons to help you with tracking diseases and debuffs on the target to keep ur dot up at all times.  I use icehud to keep track of my runes and health n stuff and power aura to keep track of debuffs.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I use the first one because it's very similar to the unholy rotation that I'm used to, and because everytime I try the second rotation there seem to be long gaps screwing things up.

		<div class="intellitxt" id="post_message_1245052"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I have been MT/OTing ulduar 10 up to mimiron and 25 up to kologarn and I have pretty much stuck to a blood tank spec. It is not my prefered spec, I was frost and a little bit unholy before uld but the extra hp from blood seems to help a lot while our gear is still being upgraded. Anyways my spec has seen a lot of changes, I know there has not been enough time for there to become a real consences on what the "best" spec is but there are a few talents I am really confused about.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
I am pretty happy with frost and unholy parts, I know some people dont like morbidity but i get a lot of use out of D&amp;D so the 15 second cooldown is nice. The imp icy touch is not set in stone we just dont have a lot of shamans so I usually get some use out of it. Mostly it is the blood talents that I am debating.<br>
<br>
Scent of Blood: I have seen so many tanks and guide specs suggest this but for the life of me I cannot figure out why. As a blood tank 90% of the time I have RP coming out my ears, I have absolutly no need for more RP when there are plenty of other places to put my talents.<br>
<br>
Spell Deflection: this talent seems way to situational to me, plus I am not really sure what it effects. Is it only spells that are cast at you or just anything that isn't a dot? Anyways as a dk my parry chance is pretty low anyways and a low chance at advoiding a low amount of damage just doesn't seem that justifiable. Plus most of the stuff that seems to kill me as a tank are things like fusion punch and frozen blows which I am pretty sure isn't magic damage.<br>
<br>
Mark of Blood: I have always used it but the benifits seem small, I usually try to use it after popping VB, I guess every little bit of healing helps and it is only 1 point but a 3 minute cooldown for very little hp, I dunno.<br>
<br>
Bloodworms: I have never used this because I don't think I have ever heard anyone reccomend it. Just wondering why, what kind of healing do you get out of it?<br>
<br>
Imp blood pres: Again I didn't see the use out of spending 2 points for a minute amount of healing but in thinking about it it is basicly a permanent mark of blood so why not?<br>
<br>
Sudden Doom: Free death coils are great I am sure I just have never had the free points for it.<br>
<br>
I hope this is ok to post here, if not I apologize but I have searched the forums for a few days and I have not been able to find any real information regarding these talents.<br>

</div>a) Yes, you want to gem for STR over expertise.<br>
<br>
Ideally you hit the soft cap of 26 Expertise (note - not "Expertise Rating" ~213.2), but it's more something you want to be keeping an eye on rather than forcing through gemming, taking a worse item just for expertise, etc.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Just looking at bog standard recount information while tanking, my white damage is extreamly low anyway, and therefore the % of threat generated via my white dps being rather small.

		<div class="intellitxt" id="post_message_1246568"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->It has been stated that Killing Machine only procs off of white damage auto-attacks, from what I could find, which seems all well and good. The verbiage on Scent of Blood (gain of runic power on next 3 melee attacks) would lead me to believe it has the same effect, and unable to find any explicit contradiction of this, I'm assuming that this is indeed how it works.<br>
<br>
The question(s) I have are the following:<br>
Can a Rune Strike trigger Killing Machine? I know for many purposes, such as BCB and Necrosis, it isn't considered a standard melee, and if so, it would seem that the more avoidance you have the less useful Killing Machine <i>might</i> be. The reasoning being more avoidance -&gt; more rune strikes -&gt; fewer auto-attacks.<br>
<br>
As for Scent of Blood, does the runic power gain only come during auto-attacks, or can it be triggered by specials? And is Rune Strike considered an auto-attack and essentially refund runic power when Scent of Blood is up?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I would not recommend going this route.  You will have single target aggro problems.  This rotation sound gimmicky, and usually that's a good indication something is wrong with it.  To answer your original question, BB is not effected by expertise.<br>
<br>
Stacking avoidance at the expense of expertise is probably not smart because avoidance has diminishing returns.  So up until about 25 expertise, you will likely generate more aggro from expertise w/ a standard rotation than you would from the extra rune strikes from stacking avoidance.  <br>
<br>
As you gear up, you'll gain avoidance naturally, and not at the expense of other stats.  I'd say the average fully Nax geared DK is going to have at least 40% - 50% avoidance.<br>
<br>
Keep your stats balanced, and you'll succeed.  Avoidance has very little value on high magic damage fights.  Stamina almost always has value, but only up until a certain point.  Then it's up to the healers.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">a) Yes, you want to gem for STR over expertise.<br>

Ideally you hit the soft cap of 26 Expertise (note - not "Expertise Rating" ~213.2), but it's more something you want to be keeping an eye on rather than forcing through gemming, taking a worse item just for expertise, etc.</div>

If i go strictly on STR (switching items in with ARP, gemming, enchanting, etc.) my exp. drops from 24 to 16. Which seems very low for a blood dk where a lot of dmg comes from physical strikes.<br>

</div>The Blood DPS thread frequently recommends only gemming for STR.  As DPS, you'll be hitting from the back, so parry is off the table, decreasing the value of expertise.  Check out the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100809232457/http://www.wowhead.com/?items&amp;filter=qu=3:4;minle=200;ub=6;gm=3;gb=1;wt=134:20:114:119:117:96:103:21:77:41;wtv=9.89:2.89:2.75:2.51:2.47:1.56:1.5:1.37:1:0.03" target="_blank">stat weights</a> to prioritize your stat choices.  I don't recall ever seeing a point where expertise is a better choice than strength.<br>
<br>
I can tell you that with 18 expertise, my physical attacks are dodged on average about 1.5% of the time and never parried (which is exactly what you would expect mathematically).  That equates to about 2-3 missed attacks for me on the average fight in Ulduar 25.  Maybe 20k damage assuming they all critically hit.  Without doing the math, I would say that making the 98.5% of hits that landed hit harder is my priority.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Oh i compelatly understand what you mean, and I knew that Single target TPS would suffer because of it, am more curious as to "by how much?" And if the TPS say drops to a point where it is still possible to keep agro from the most agro hungry DPS, then the gimick then becomes interesting for gaining extra stamina/avoidence without the worry of not being able to hold agro.</div>

</div>It all really depends on the DPS of your raid members if you can hold aggro.  According to WoWWiki the frost presence threat multiplier is 2.0735.  So assuming no rune strikes, your total threat will be your damage done * 2.0735.  Your rotation is certainly not going to build any "snap aggro" on a single target.  Anyhow, do you run Omen or WWS?  If so, I'd suggest giving it a try for yourself and comparing the results to your current build.  <br>
<br>
My opinion is that you are going to be using lower DPS multi-target spells for single target tanking, and that your aggro is going to suffer a lot more than you realize.  Once the rune strikes start piling up, it just might work though.  It just doesn't make any sense to me why you'd want to do this...  Everything in the game that has been tanked up until this point by a DK has not needed this odd strategy, why reinvent the wheel?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Am just more thinking at the way we as DK's value expertise at the moment. Currently we veiw it at a way to increase TPS, but am thinking overall that if there was a way to 1) compleatly disreguard expertise and still sustain a decent amount of TPS then opens the door for more stats that yeild a higher amount of TPS, such as Strengh or even crit. 2) As none of the moves that you could use could be parried, it stops the dreaded parry haste gibbing situation that sometimes occurs. <br>
<br>
Back in TBC there was the old rogue crusade of being "unhittable" , and with the correct set of gear/gems/buffs it could be achieved. So yes, doing this would be a gimmick, but if it is able to perform its funcion , namely "keeping agro" then I believe it might be worthwhile exploring. <br>
<br>
I have been experimenting with this in a very simple naxx 10 man run the other evening, and saw no problems at all on tanking say patchwork or thaddius. Was comfortably putting out 5.5k TPS the whole fight, and DPS was not "on my heals" any more than using a standard rotation. A simple test I know, but had to start somewhere.  Now this is before I have altered gear and dropped expertise, but am pretty confident that dropping to even the bare 6-7 expertise on my gear and swaping stats for more avoidence and strengh that the TPS would not suffer but would infact go up. <br>
<br>
Will be working on this in greater details this evening and more than happy to actualy post some numbers of what I find rather than mindless "what if this happened drivel"<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I apologise if this question has been brought up before there are alot of pages on this thread<br>
but Im a Frost DK tank and i recently specced bladed armour and scent of blood in the blood tree instead of 2 handed weapon specializaion.<br>
My question is, is there much difference in speccing bladed armor instead of 2 handed specialization, I understand scent of blood the extra rp is ideal for recurring FStrikes but i noticed in a few DK frost tank specs bladed armor is taken over the 4% extra weapon damage. <br>
Is there a good reason for this and is it worth maybe getting both bladed armour and 2handed weapon spec (apart from the obvious lack of points)<br>

</div>It is all about stat weights.

I.E. for blood, the stat weight of ATK is 1, and the stat weight of crit is 1.56.  So 70 ATK would equal 70, and  10 crit would equal 15.6.  Whichever upgrade gives you the most total points is usually the winner.  That is vastly over simplified, but you get the point.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Can a Rune Strike trigger Killing Machine? I know for many purposes, such as BCB and Necrosis, it isn't considered a standard melee, and if so, it would seem that the more avoidance you have the less useful Killing Machine <i>might</i> be. The reasoning being more avoidance -&gt; more rune strikes -&gt; fewer auto-attacks.<br>
<br>
As for Scent of Blood, does the runic power gain only come during auto-attacks, or can it be triggered by specials? And is Rune Strike considered an auto-attack and essentially refund runic power when Scent of Blood is up?</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">The Blood DPS thread frequently recommends only gemming for STR.  As DPS, you'll be hitting from the back, so parry is off the table, decreasing the value of expertise.  Check out the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100809232457/http://www.wowhead.com/?items&amp;filter=qu=3:4;minle=200;ub=6;gm=3;gb=1;wt=134:20:114:119:117:96:103:21:77:41;wtv=9.89:2.89:2.75:2.51:2.47:1.56:1.5:1.37:1:0.03" target="_blank">stat weights</a> to prioritize your stat choices.  I don't recall ever seeing a point where expertise is a better choice than strength.<br>
<br>
I can tell you that with 18 expertise, my physical attacks are dodged on average about 1.5% of the time and never parried (which is exactly what you would expect mathematically).  That equates to about 2-3 missed attacks for me on the average fight in Ulduar 25.  Maybe 20k damage assuming they all critically hit.  Without doing the math, I would say that making the 98.5% of hits that landed hit harder is my priority.</div>

</div>Thanks  for the responses!<br>
<br>
I did Ulduar25 yesterday regemmed straight to STR with 17 exp (24 exp before re-gem), and i must say that i´m not happy at all. The whole handling seemed to be screwed up by missed (3,4-3,9% miss in my case) strikes. <br>
<br>
I did hit harder offcourse, but had a hard time to keep the rotation running. So it just doesn´t make sense to me to let exp drop under a certain value.<br>
<br>
I gemmed a socket with +27 exp instead of +27 str now and we´ll see how that works out...<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>When you're dps'ing, as you indicated, you will really <b>FEEL</b> a miss/dodge/parry, but the increase in your dmg isn't nearly as tangible.  You're much less likely to notice hitting 100 dmg harder than you are a miss.  This is really important to understand.<br>
<br>
My suggestion would be to stick with the STR and run a WWS report, you can really break down all your misses well, and see what you are really losing.  If it is still frustrating then you can try going back to expertise, running another WWS, and comparing your results.  Don't go just off how it feels like you're doing, b/c the nature of misses will make it deceiving.<br>
<br>
The stat weights can only tell you so much, sometimes you have to prove it to yourself.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

As a theoretical example say that unholy is great for DPS until you get some good Naxx drops and your unbuffed AP hits 3000, then once you get through NAXX and get some really solid gear Frost is better, and then when you hit Ulduar, Blood seems to overtake Frost.<br>
<br>
I'm not saying those are real barriers, and that all aren't always viable when you know what you're doing, just trying to work the idea out of my brain meats. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100809232457im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":)" class="inlineimg"><br>

Right now I'm blood specced, and wondering if there was another tree that I "should" be specced into that might render better results. Right now my guild is still working our way through Naxx, having only 4 horseman, Saph, and KT left to go. We also don't have an enhancement shammy, so Frost is starting to look like it might be a smart guild/raid benefiting spec.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Your glyphs look good to me.  A couple of suggestions though:<br>
<br>
1. You are over hit cap by about 50.  262 or 8% should be hit cap goal, especially if you're Frost.  Unholy gets more of a benefit from going over hit cap than any other tree.<br>
<br>
2.  Are you weaving in FS on KM procs?  If not, that could be a big loss in DPS.  Get a proc watcher, like "Tell Me When" or setup SCT with a custom event for KM.  When it procs, if you have enough for a frost strike, use it immediately, then go back to your rotation.  My rotation in frost looks something more like this (Blood Presence):<br>
<br>
IT &gt; PS &gt; BS &gt; BS &gt; OB <br>
OB &gt; FS &gt; OB &gt; FS &gt; OB &gt; FS<br>
<br>
Priority wise, I only cast FS when I'm A) Going to cap on RP, or B) Have a KM proc up.<br>
<br>
3. You have some odd gem and enchanting choices.  Gem for STR, and enchant for ATK as a general rule.  Unless you're low on another important stat, like hit.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I've found single disease, with my gear and play style to do less single target DPS on average than double disease.  In AOE heavy fights, I've seen some very high numbers from the FF only style of rotation + glyph of HB.  My personal preference is the double disease rotation I gave you in the previous post.  Partially because it hurts my hands to run in unholy presence.<br>
<br>
With that said, there's a lot of debate over single vs. dual disease rotations.  Some of the best single target frost DPS can come from the "Machine Gun" rotation, which if I'm correct you already tried and it did not work out for you.  It's gear dependent, and requires at a minimum the Sigil of Vengeance.<br>
<br>
The rotation you should be using if you are doing single disease is as follows:<br>
<br>
HB -&gt; OB -&gt; BS -&gt; BS -&gt; DUMP<br>
OB -&gt; OB -&gt; OB -&gt; DUMP<br>
<br>
Obviously, it relies on the HB glyph.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1251495"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->A quite possibly stupid question to put forward to your guys, but in regards to tanking - what do you guys end up emphasizing in your gemming; straight sta, stat (threat/avoidance) deficiencies, or something else? I used to push STA straight; but when I ran some quick math on it... By flipping out my non-prismatic stamina gems, I lose the grand total of 2.7k health (when fully buffed with kings and such) leaving me with an unbuffed 32.5k. For experimental purposes on threat gain; I regemmed the plain +24 sta gems to enirely focus on bringing myself up to hit/exp caps - a drastic change that will be some what mitigated in extremity once I am so lucky to even see a exp/hit weapon drop. <br>
<br>
With how bloody hard Ulduar bosses end up hitting I've found the 2.7k HP to be damned near non-existant loss. It does make me wince to lose any HP; but because of how hard they *do* hit; I've never found myself in a situation where I would of survived if I had the 2.7k more HP.<br>
<br>
I really like the extra boost to threat just because of how hard some of the DPS classes can push their threat when they unload, and gives them more time to nuke before they have to worry about threat issues. So I'm somewhat at an impasse; what are you guys opinions?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>That particular rotation is used to generate maximum RP.  IT is used to get +10 RP from the Glyph of Icy Touch.  If you've got T7.5, the double obliterates will net you an additional 5 RP each.  Then you start FS.  The sooner you can start frost striking, the more aggro you're going to generate.  Remember FS cannot be dodged, nor parried.  It's also not boosted by either FF or BF.  So it's pretty ideal for tanking, when RS isn't up.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">i am curious is gear level should determine spec.<br>
<br>
As a theoretical example say that unholy is great for DPS until you get some good Naxx drops and your unbuffed AP hits 3000, then once you get through NAXX and get some really solid gear Frost is better, and then when you hit Ulduar, Blood seems to overtake Frost.<br>
<br>
I'm not saying those are real barriers, and that all aren't always viable when you know what you're doing, just trying to work the idea out of my brain meats. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20090819083958im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":)" class="inlineimg"><br>
<br>
Right now I'm blood specced, and wondering if there was another tree that I "should" be specced into that might render better results. Right now my guild is still working our way through Naxx, having only 4 horseman, Saph, and KT left to go. We also don't have an enhancement shammy, so Frost is starting to look like it might be a smart guild/raid benefiting spec.</div>

Since most fights you take some form of damage would this be of any use as a DPS'er as opposed to a tank. I know it may sound like a stupid question but for instance, Hodir the constant frost damage, Auri the defender, razorscale lava balls, kologarns sweep.<br>

<br>
Since most fights you take some form of damage would this be of any use as a DPS'er as opposed to a tank. I know it may sound like a stupid question but for instance, Hodir the constant frost damage, Auri the defender, razorscale lava balls, kologarns sweep.<br>
<br>
Would any of this damage cause Scent of Blood to kick in?</div>

</div>The tooltip states direct damage, thus implying a targeted ability in use against you. Damaging auras, boss-centred magic explosions, whole of room damage from arm sweeps should not proc this ability, although the razorscale fireballs may well do as they target you.<br>

</div>In the simulations in Rawr for my gear, 0/10/61 beats 12/0/59 by a whopping 36dps raid buffed. In my eyes, this isn't enough of a reason to lose the threat reduction given how often I see Thorim arena gibs/immortal guardian overaggros, and also bearing in mind that it is a theoretical maximum assuming you do everything right. There isn't a set point at which you should change, and you can model it through any number of sims as to which would be better for the current gear you have.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Right but I'm talking about the fact that this is scheduled to be released at the same time as epic gems, which I understand to be on par or just shy of Dragons Eyes.  In light of that shrunken stat gap (as opposed to the current somewhat large stat difference between 16 and 27), will JC's value in a purely theorycraft way be diminished?  And if so, what will be its successor?<br>
<br>
There is a rumor that JC epic trinkets will come out too, but until we see actual stats hard to say if the trinkets will beat the current BiS.  From what I remember in BC JC trinkets weren't terrible but nothing to get worked up over, since an end-game raider would have far better than even the epic ones.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>The way you do it should be the most efficient one. The only alternative would be to HSx2 before you reapply your diseases, but the lost damage multiplier from diseases is probably significantly larger than using a DD for Death Strike (technically you have a 50% chance to not lose any damage that way, since those two death runes will be death runes again in the next round instead of FU).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Read the Unholy thread.  Ebon Plaguebringer is our way of spreading the coe/oomkin debuff over a large amount of targets, very quickly.  if you have a very reliablye raiding oomkin then Unholy's value is somewhat diminished, but not on big add fights (Freya and Thorim come to mind).  Remember that Icy talons is basically a Windfury totem away from being redundant.  So just ask "are we usually short an oomkin or a shaman" and you'll have your answer.  At this time we don't have any really unique buffs.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I'm fairly new to blood specs (and death knights in general) so this may be just a learn to play issue, but I was wondering how should I deal with situations when my rotation gets interrupted at BBDDDD because I have to run out or a boss phase changes etc. When I resume fighting I have to reapply diseases and both my unholy runes get used up by PS/IT and I'm left with BBDDUU and my FU pairs get completely messed up. What's the best sequence to get my rotation back on track? I've been doing PS IT and then DS to make sure the pairs stay synced (because if I do HS x4 I end up with 2 unholy runes and no frost runes to use DS). I was wondering if there was a better way.</div>

	</tbody></table>
</div><br>
I have noticed this at some points. if u are BBDDDD and apply dots and then cast a DS, one of the U runes will trade places with one of the new D runes that u have activated of the F runes. at least it does for me. <br>
<br>
try that if u are BBDDDD go,<br>
PS,IT,DS,HS,HS and see that u after cd's u get BBDFDU<br>
<br>
<br>
now on to a question of my own<br>
<br>
I have during the last week noticed something with my dancing runweapon.<br>
it's uptime is not correct with the tooltip given.<br>
<br>
DRW tooltip says a weapon that fights on it's own for 10sec plus 1 sec per 10 runic power.<br>
<br>
10+6(if Rp is 100 cost for spell is 40 RP) = 16 sec + 5 second from the glyph =21 sec<br>
<br>
that is close to the time of my buff atm. my buff when activating DRW starts at 20sec.<br>
<br>
however<br>
<br>
I have runic power mastery witch means 30 more runic power equaling to 3 more seconds <br>
<br>
10sec (spell activation)+9sec (runic power 130 - 40 for spellcost) + 5 (glyph)<br>
10+9+5=24<br>
<br>
unless there is something I have missed me/we are getting robbed out of 4 seconds on our dancing rune weapon<br>
<br>
is there something I have missed that makes the DRW to never be active for more then 20 sec?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>However if you do that to cast a SS, one of the two Blood Runes will refresh as a Death Rune because of BT. You can't cast another SS from 1 BR, 1 DR, so you'll be stuck on casting two BS's. But by the time those two refresh again BT will have elapsed and the DR from before will go back to being a BR, leaving you with 1 DR, 1 BR again. The only ways out of this are to either accept casting 2 BS's for 2 rotations or to wait before casting the first set of BS's or to cancel BT manually.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>For one thing you don't have wandering plague.  Look up the appropriate spec on the Unholy tree.  Although that shouldn't account for that much dps difference.  I'm assuming they're only getting 6k ish on bosses correct?  If you're account for overall and you're doing naxx just drop DnD and just aoe like crazy.  Also I myself found that the other spec was better when you're not in ulduar gear yet and and the 10/61 spec is only good or gets to be better when you get ulduar gear.  Try out the blood/unholy spec and see how it goes.  If you're doing raids make sure you're flasked and food buffed with the appropriate buffs (i.e might, kings, motw, windfury, warrior crit, etc) to maximize ur dps.  Also make use of those speed pots before you throw out that gargoyle.  Keep track of your diseases to keep them up at all times (frost fever, plague strike one, unholy blight).  Best of luck to you!<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">OK I am wearing most of the best in slot pre-uld gear and I am having trouble getting over 4.2-4.5k DPS. I recently ran a raid with another DK that was wearing similar gear as me and was pulling 6.5-7K DPS.  I am following the PS-IT-BS-BS -SS RP -SS-SS-SS RP and eaither refresh or continue with SS.  Does timing of the attack have alot to do with DPS or why would I be so much lower? We were both using the 10/61 Frost unholy build.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>I'm having similar trouble.  I am not pulling the numbers I should be, despite following the suggested rotation/priority system.  One thing I'm noticing is that I have no found a mod that reliably monitors ghoul frenzy.  Is there one that can help me keep better track of it instead of having to manually scan the ghouls buffs on pet bar?  <br>
<br>
Also, is there a point when the armor pen on ulduar gear makes Blood eclipse 0/10/61?  In ulduar gear, does frost beat the other two from a pure theorycrafting point of view?<br>
<br>
Another thing I noticed is rotations (especially when I expirement with blood) getting badly mangled due to dodges (or the occasional parry if the tank moves wierd on mobility fights).  Now I trust the research behind the weights for expertise etc, but if it interfering with rotations to the point where I'm seeing more dps in Unholy presence because of faster correction, should I be gemming differently?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>This is something that has come up when the jewelcrafting changes wer announced (since most BiS lists generally assume Jewelcrafting prismatic gems). For Blood and perhaps Frost at least a Relentless/Tear combination might pull ahead, due to how much is damge is affected by phsyical crit and how beneficial crit is. For Unholy it depends largely on the potential socket bonus you would get from socketing the second Sovereign Twilight Opal, since for that spec 2 strength is superior to 6 agility. But even for Frost and Blood socket bonuses must be taken into account to get a conclusive decision.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1268193"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->since searching for Death Coil didn't answer and DC is too broad, for Blood, I'm trying to follow the rotation (Which is anything but neat or tight thanks to dodges) and I'm hitting RP cap nonstop.  Should I just ignore it and only DC when I have a free GCD, or, like Unholy, stop the rotation for a second to get uncapped?  <br>
<br>
Also does someone have the link to the math proving that blood is better than unholy (presences I mean) for the cookie cutter blood dps spec?  I've been expirementing with Unholy, and thanks to better recovery from dodges, actually have better dps (testing on dummies, I haven't actually tried it on bosses), so I'd like to see the WWS etc actually proving it if someone knows where I can find it (glanced through blood thread but its all newer discussion).  And on a related note, if Blood &gt; Unholy, how certain are we on Expertise weights?  I ask because I'm getting righteously fucked up in the rotation when I get a dodge and and in Blood presence the whole thing starts to get slightly off kilter, not the ezmoad that other people talk about.  <br>
<br>
In addition, what is the armor pen one should have before attempting to dps as Blood?  I know Blood values Apn very highly, is 6% (without talent) enough?  <br>
Not asking for hand holding (but if someone wanted to armory me and point out any obvious mistakes in a PM I would'nt complain), I would just like to see the actual math proving some of these presences and weights, and an explanation of certain mechanics.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I trust your wisdom here, as I realize how great the T7 bonus is. However, it sucks to be getting new ulduar gear and be unable to use it. Is there a AEP value that effectively summarizes how much the t7 bonus contributes? As in, after a certain amount of stats gained does the bonus become obsolete, or is it simply waiting until the t8 bonus replaces the t7 one.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Not sure if it is a DPS increase or not though =/  The reason why I say it might not be is because it does cause a GCD which realistically slows down a fresh new UF rune that you can SS.  Might slow down by about .5 GCD cause the rune isn't up when you use HoW but it would be up after about half your GCD is done.  I don't know maybe I'm overthinking it but I'd rather like to see if it is a definitive DPS increase or should I just keep pressing SS as much as possible instead and only use it whenever my shamans are too lazy to redrop their freaking totems!<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Aesir's Edge is a significant TPS boost through weapon dps alone, as well as the additional expertise from the human racial (depending on how much you already have you can only use the -parry, but still). It has more base stamina and two sockets and decreases probabilty of parry haste, so it's a no-brainer when it comes to survivabilty. Overall it's clearly an upgrade despite the hit-loss, but sooner or later you should probably look into that, although it's not necessarily a top-priority.<br>

		<div id="post_message_1274211"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->While on the topic of macros, I'm curious if anyone's tried using the following macro when tanking<br>
<br>
/use <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100901204108/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=40714" target="_blank">Sigil of Unfaltering Knight</a><br>

<br>
I've noticed that swapping Sigils does not trigger a GCD, but seems to have a very short internal cooldown before allowing you to swap sigils again thus making it necessary to double tap the macro hotkey.<br>
Also if i recall correctly (I dont have access to WoW atm) when I added "#showtooltip" to the macro it treated the hotkey as if it's the trinket not Icy Touch (creates a glow around the button, does not display IT's cooldown, etc.)<br>
I also tried adding Rune Strike to the equation and it just got a little crazy so i ended up abandoning the whole macro but I'm wondering if anyone would know a way to get it to work properly<br>
<br>
Another option would be to macro the UK sigil to IT and Awareness to Obliterate<br>

</div>I would suggest straying away from using a sigil swap while tanking especially if you are relying on the defense from Sigil of the Unfaltering Knight to stay capped. It's clunky, and will probably cause you more problems than it's worth. Swapping in Sigil of Awareness for tanking would be to generate more threat so I'd urge you to pursue other avenues to increase your threat first.<br>
<br>
It looks like you could gain threat by swapping your Frost tanking glyphs. Glyph of Obliterate and Glyph of Frost strike would both be net TPS gains over Glyph of Unbreakable Armor and Glyph of Howling Blast.

</div>I assumed the opposite: that you used the defense sigil normally. For pre-ulduar25 I'd still go with Awareness. I use Deflection myself now. As for your DPS comments I think that a sigil swap macro would slow your rotations down so that anything you might have gained would be lost by the slower rotations. You also open yourself up to mistakes like Death Coiling with Awareness on, and Scourge Striking with Vengeful Heart on. All of the high TPS and DPS parses I've seen were from people that don't use such macros.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1276344"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Noob question here.<br>
<br>
When comparing item qualities for prioritization of DPS, the blood post has the following table:<br>
<br>
Stat	 APE<br>
Attack Power	1<br>
Weapon DPS	9.89<br>
Strength	2.89<br>
Armor Penetration	2.75<br>
Hit Rating (to cap)	2.51<br>
Expertise Rating	2.47<br>
Crit Rating	1.56<br>
Haste Rating	1.5<br>
Agility	1.37<br>
Hit Rating (to spell hit cap)	.52<br>
Armor	.03<br>
<br>
So does that mean I use the above multiplier on the stats?<br>
<br>
For instance, if I'm wearing an item that is 50 Attack power and I have the chance to upgrade that slot to an item with 10 AP and 30 armor pen, the math is as follows:<br>
<br>
Item 1 <br>
AP = 1 * 50 = rating 50<br>
<br>
Item 2<br>
Armor Pen = 2.75 * 30 = 82.5<br>
<br>

</div>Taking a step back here. While in general this is solid advice there are some situations where I'd prioritize HoW over other abilities.

No difference in Dps yet but you will have HoW on CD earlier and thereby be able to cast more HoW's. Same can be done with the rune cushioning.

		<div id="post_message_1277690"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Dark Command can be resisted, it's on the spell hit table.  Being only melee hit capped is not enough if you want to eliminate a potential resist.<br>
<br>
A "spell" attack in Blizzard parlance is something that either hits or misses (resist).   A "melee" attack can hit, miss, dodge, parry or block.<br>
<br>
Death Grip is the ideal if you want to eliminate a failed taunt, it cannot miss and so does not fail as a taunt.  The move part can fail if the mob is immobilised but the taunt effect will always land.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1278352"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I have an opinion question for experienced DKs.<br>
<br>
I played mut rogue for some time and I found that, stat weights be damned, I love expertise. The difference between gemming optimally (AP/agi) and gemming for expertise was worth little dps loss in theory. I found that expertise was undervalued though, at least for me, because nothing hurt my cycle more than two consecutive dodges on an envenom, as it would completely destroy my cycle and I would basically have to restart everything from scratch. <br>
<br>
I am leveling a DK now and I was wondering, is there some similar effect for DKs? Having a disease applications like PS dodged seems less drastic, but is it still largely detrimental to both tanking and DPS cycles in a raid setting? Aside from lost damage (and threat for tanks), is there any other effects that you have found dodges to have on your cycle?<br>
<br>
Thanks in advance.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1278851"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->The value of expertise varies for each spec, but in general, it is the most important for blood.  The main reason being that it's a GCD heavy rotation, so consecutive dodges can really push your rotation back.  It's not as important for frost because your #1 source of damage is frost strike which doesn't gain benefit from expertise.  Also, howling blast/icy touch do not gain benefit from expertise.  Unholy usually has spare GCDs and so it's not as big of a deal for unholy either.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
2) I don't have Vengeful Heart yet (our last one was given to an unholy dk=/), and given the numbers here, that means frost should be lagging behind.. but I've been unable to deal nearly as much damage as unholy in any situation as I can with blood or frost, with the exception of unholy being better for me on razorscale.

		<div id="post_message_1279119"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Blood speced tanks are not superior or inferior in any fights, although the self-healing is useful on hard-mode Vezax (so I hear - we haven't gotten to that point yet).  Blood tanks use the same gear, more or less, although since most of the damage you do is physical, you'll arguably get more benefit from expertise than other (frost/unholy) tanks, and your threat will benefit from a sunder effect (from your pocket warrior, of course).  I've tanked Ulduar content in all three trees, and found benefits and deficiencies in all of them.<br>
<br>
Frost is probably popular because it has both good single-target and multi-target threat capability, and reasonably good cooldowns - although who really knows.<br>
<br>
DW tanking is generally a bad idea right now.  You can get enough threat from any standard tanking build in any tree without having to resort to silly tactics.<br>
<br>
I also did a quick search on Frozen Blows - pg. 116 of Suno's Fireside Chat has your answer.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Honestly for heroics and ten man Naxx it really doesn't matter what tanking spec you use. This works out in your favor as you can try all three and you basically get to pick the play style that you prefer. Unholy has the best AOE so you may find that for heroics you prefer it. Frost has good AOE and good single target. You might find it to be a nice mix. Blood is extremely good single target, and weak AOE, but certainly fun to play.<br>
<br>
All specs have their ups and downs, and at that level of content you should choose the one that's the most fun to play. As for talent builds there are other threads with that info.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>1) Reason you're seeing this:  You're hitting for NEARLY the same damage, and faster, because the polearm is faster and has more unbuffed AP, haste, and crit.  If you had a slower wpn, such as Ironfoe or Cryptfiend's Bite, you'd probably be seeing more damage because they have higher top end dmg than Relentless Edge.<br>
<br>
2) Your unholy dk probably doesn't play as well as he should (rotations, spec, gear, etc).  Player performance is the biggest factor in dps.  You may just be better than him.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Improved Frost Presence	Rank 2<br>
While in Blood Presence or Unholy Presence, you retain 10% health from Frost Presence, and damage done to you is decreased by an additional 2% in Frost Presence.<br>

Frost Presence<br>
1 Frost<br>

The death knight takes on the presence of frost, increasing total health by 10%, armor contribution from cloth, leather, mail and plate items by 60%, and reducing damage taken by 5%.  Increases threat generated.  Only one Presence may be active at a time.<br>

Frost presence increases your health by 10%, and Improved Frost Presence lets you keep that 10% in any presence. The other talents for Blood and Unholy presence work similarly by letting you keep one aspect of the presence even when you aren't in it.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Frost presence increases your health by 10%, and Improved Frost Presence lets you keep that 10% in any presence. The other talents for Blood and Unholy presence work similarly by letting you keep one aspect of the presence even when you aren't in it.</div>

</div>From my understanding, it can proc from disease ticks. Someone else also mentioned that talents like Black Ice does increase the damage from the card and on wowhead this person did a test and saw it crit up to 6k damage, which is pretty good for a trinket.<br>
<br>
My guess is that the internal cooldown is 45 seconds, but it does damage each time you do damage, in comparison to Mirror of Truth, which procs when you crit.<br>
<br>
So my question is, as DMC: D got a big improvement since the last patch, is it worthy of being replaced by say... Mirror of Truth? Undoubtedly that Mirror of Truth is great for fights like Patchwerk, assuming one does not have Bandit's Insignia, but for high mobility fights like Razorscale, this could be the other way around.<br>
<br>
As for your last question, I honestly don't know. It is interesting that this trinket is about equal to Bandit's Insignia now, apart from the fact that Bandit's Insignia gives AP and Death gives crit. I am curious if I could replace my Mirror of Truth for Darkmoon Card: Death.<br>
<br>
I do know that this trinket was buffed since last patch, well or the description was changed. Either way, people discarded it quickly, but since the change a lot of people are questioning its value, especially in comparison to Mirror of Truth.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1283929"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Just a few simple questions.<br>
<br>
For blood, I have  Pyrite Infuser, Mirror, Fury of the Five Flights, and Greatness Card.  Now I know Greatness Card is a given in any spec.  But I'm a little uncertain about the others.  I rotate between Blood and Frost dps specs, and I'm not sure which is better for what.  On fights where I'm blood (everything but hodir/thorim), would I get more advantage out of the 320 AP constantly, or the crit with 1000 ap proc?  I maintain nearly 100% uptime of Fury, so I'm not sure.  Also, if I were to fall below hit cap (right now I'm at 7.8% or so) would pyrite infusor take priority over either, and if so whats the threshold where teh wasted Hit would still be more dps than the other two because of the proc?<br>
<br>
Also, a question about Frost.  In the frost thread it talks about hit being &gt; everything else.  Does that mean the spell hit cap (seeing as how frost relies more on actual spells), or melee?  And is that for 6x IT or HB builds?  I currently use HB on hodir/thorim as its what I'm more familiar with, and for those fights I typically throw on Mirror, but if I'm at melee cap, should I be using Pyrite instead?  What about if I was asked to go frost for other fights?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Anything and everything that is affected by a stamina modifier is also affected by a health modifier. The thing is, a health modifier <i>also</i> modifies such things as base health, health from the chest enchant, and health from buffs such as Commanding Shout/Flask/Etc. <br>
<br>
As such, going from 10% health to 10% stamina would be a nerf in and of itself. Then add in the lower percent modifier, and yeah. Never will a stamina modifier outscale an equivalent health modifier, and if the first is lower to begin with, the gap just widens.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Based on the APE Chart taken from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090919051632/http://elitistjerks.com/f72/t61176-blood_simple_consolidated_blood_dk_dps_guide/" target="_blank">Blood Simple</a> thread the tier 8.5 legs come to 821 APE vs Clockwork's 871.02. (Including gems for socket bonuses, excluding leg armors)<br>
<br>
However, if you're hit capped without Clockwork Leggings (which according to your Armory you are) then they're only worth 715.40 APE. Making the tier 8.5 legs the better choice.<br>
<br>
Hope that helps.<br>
<br>
Edit: Apparently he got himself banned. I guess it doesn't help.  <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20090919051632im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/tinfoil.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":tinfoil:" class="inlineimg"><!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Greatness is worth it.  It's a major dps increase and the proc rate is far higher than pyrite infuser or MoT.  The card has a 45 second CD and is pretty much garanteed to proc as soon as its off CD.  So basicly its like 190 STR.  I like frost better than UH or Blood. Restitance isn't a prob really with the spec.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Mind freeze uses the spell hit cap, that is correct. Thus, you will need a total of 17% spell hit in order to prevent missed interrupts. You can get 3% from Virulence and 3% from raid debuffs, meaning you will only require 11% total spell hit, or somewhere in the range of 300 hit rating (check your paperdoll for exact numbers).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
Looking over the BiS thread, the section for Alliance Blood lists Crusher (+44 Attack Power) as the ideal enchant instead of Major Strength (+15 Strength).  According to the stat weights for Blood, Crusher comes to 44 APE vs Major Strength's 43.35. However, Blessing of Kings would bring Major Strength to 46.4 APE, and RotFC's proc would bring it to 49.85.<br>
<br>
Even without a second Paladin in the group for Kings, wouldn't RotFC's high uptime make Major Strength the better enchant? Or is there something I've overlooked?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I've thought about switching to ArPen gems myself in order to see if there is a noticeable DPS increase, but the amount of spec-swapping I do (I commonly swap to Frost or Unholy depending on my 10man's group composition) demands that I keep strength gems in my gear or spend a ridiculous amount of money.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I feel Unholy is best, due to 20% mount speed and 15% run speed (in Blood Aura), also the perma-pet is nice dps once you get the glyph, in addition the AoE is top-notch (at least pre-3.2).<br>
<br>
Blood is also a solid leveling spec, if you like self-healing abilities.<br>

I am still not hit capped (7,87%) But i read on this forum that even if i'm not hit capped, i should still gem my gear with STR or APR. If i do that, i will end up at 6.50%ish hit, is it worth it? (I'm already Expertise capped)</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I have a question regarding arp.  Everywhere I read, everyoen says after 6200ap raid buffed, it's better to stack arp gems over strength.<br>
<br>
However, I'm looking at EVERY end game raider and no one is doing it...including the guys i commonly read on this forum...kroot, orcchaoss....etc....<br>
<br>
They all say it's better to stack arp gems after that 6200 but they don't seem to be doing it themselves.  I'm just curious why.<br>
<br>
Currently, i'm 4600ap unbuffed, and nearing 7500-8k ap buffed with about 360 arp.  I have more than enough room to start cutting some arp gems over strength, but i'm hesitant because all the end game guilds from Ensidia on down don't seem to do it.<br>
<br>
Is there a good reason?<br>
<br>
Thanks!</div>

	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>I was one of the many who concluded that gemming ArP over Str after raid buffed 6200 is in fact a DPS increase for Blood, however in a real raid situation it showed that the difference was too small to confirm beyond a shadow of a doubt.  I believe the Docs sim also shows ArP to overcome Str before 420 ArP + Trinket Proc (Grim Toll or Runestone).<br>
<br>
Str also affects all damage, so in AOE situations where you might be using more spells than physical damage the additional ArP won't help.<br>
<br>
Due to the amount of spec switching I do currently for hard modes I'm gemmed completely for Str, however I'm sitting at 500+ ArP from gear alone and over 7000 AP raid buffed as it is.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>If you scroll down on that page, near the bottom there's a section called "Other Mirrors" and a Filefront link. That download appears to still work.<br>
<br>
edit: In case the Filefront link breaks or something, the starter rotation goes like this:<br>
<br>
IT – BS – OB – FS – BT – IT – FS – OB – FS<br>
<br>
And follow a priority system like this: (for single target damage)<br>
<br>
1) FF<br>
2) FS (KM up)(or to avoid capping RP)<br>
3) Howling Blast (rime proc, use before casting Obliterate to avoid overwriting proc)<br>
4) Obliterate (U/F runes up)<br>
5) IT (Death Runes up)<br>
6) FS (no runes up)<br>
<br>
As best you can, try to keep your U/F runes refreshing in pairs, which means attempting to never have 4 death runes up at once or IT will use up two unholy runes first and mess with your rotation. Use all death runes for IT to generate RP and try not to waste KM on IT procs, though it will happen every now and then.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				Topic: Hysteria<br>
<br>
Cats are the best target for Hysteria:<br>
<br>
Arms Warrior - Does not stack with Wrecking Crew. Besides, they don't have strong Cooldowns to blow while Hysteria is up.<br>
Death Knights - A significant portion of their damage is elemental and not physical. Dancing Rune Weapon scales only half with Hysteria, summon Gargoyle doesn't at all<br>
Enhancer Shamans - A good portion of their damage is elemental. Feral spirit, their Cooldown, is not affected by Hysteria<br>
Fury Warrior - Although all of their damage is physical, they cannot blow their big Cooldown Death Wish with Hysteria, because it doesn't stack.<br>
Hunter - A good portion of their damage is elemental and their pet wouldn't benefit from Hysteria.<br>
Retribution Paladins - A very big portion of their damage is elemental.<br>
Rogues - A good portion of their damage is elemental.<br>
<br>
Cats benefit by far the most from Hysteria. As long as you are quite close to the top DPS in your raid, try to convince your Blood-DK or your raidleader, that you should get Hysteria!

The 0/10/61 spec has its first frost points in improved icy touch, a spell not really overly used. Is this spec really competitive compared to the 12/0/59 spec?

				<div style="font-style:italic">I'm still in the process of trying to maximize the dps on my alt death knight, using the unholy dps discussion thread. One thing that confuses me is that the unholy rotation requires a scourge strike glyph, which means you will not cast an awful lot of icy touch and plague strike. The 0/10/61 spec has its first frost points in improved icy touch, a spell not really overly used. Is this spec really competitive compared to the 12/0/59 spec? (bearing in mind that my DK is not that geared yet)</div>

	</tbody></table>
</div>You will see a larger gain in dps with 12/0/59 in your current gear.  0/10/61 is a build that scales via percentages, thus it is reliant on having an amount of gear to make it beat out the static scaling that 12/0/59 provides.  You should start seeing a difference between the two around late tier 7 (next to BiS) and of course into tier 8 gear.  The reason Improved Icy Touch is taken is because it *is* a dps upgrade over 3/5 Toughness because you no longer receive benefit from armor to AP as you would with Bladed Armor.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I actually had a different version of this problem today. I was in Heroic AN and while on the first boss I used HB&gt;BS&gt;BS&gt;OB//OB&gt;OB&gt;ERW&gt;OB&gt;OB&gt;OB//. The ERW didn't reset the visual CD of my runes but after each of the three Obliterates they would reset to a 9 second CD because I just used them.<br>

</div>The reason gemming for armor pen is so bad for Unholy is because most of the damage Unholy does isn't even effected by armor pen. <br>
<br>
Armor pen gems for Blood is a different story. What Darkside said 1 page ago sort of sums it up for a lot of players in Ulduar.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I've seen that number tossed around, but I don't recall ever seeing any math behind it. I've thought about switching to ArPen gems myself in order to see if there is a noticeable DPS increase, but the amount of spec-swapping I do (I commonly swap to Frost or Unholy depending on my 10man's group composition) demands that I keep strength gems in my gear or spend a ridiculous amount of money.</div>

I am not sure if this post should be made their instead but I normally feel that most of my questions belong under this thread.<br>
<br>
Anyways I am a frost tanking DK and my first question is in regards to the rotation Suno suggests:<br>
Single Target Rotation - IT-BS-OB-(Blood Tap if no Death Rune)OB RPDUMP = RS/FS<br>
<br>
While Fenita from Ensidia suggests the rotation should be PS – IT – OB – BS – BS – OB – OB – PS – IT.  While I am not as interested in the orders or BS and OB what I am interested in is why isn't PS used in Suno's rotation?<br>
<br>
Second both Suno's and Fenita's spec call for using Scent of Blood, but Fenita picks up Morbidity while Suno does not.  I really like having Morbidity and I was just wondering which blood points would be best to give to get this talent.  Would it be best to give up Scent of Blood or maybe 2 handed weapon spec and 1 point in bladed armor?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div class="intellitxt" id="post_message_1311011"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Feral dps (mostly) druid here finding myself constantly having extreme threat issues with DK tanks in my guild. My threat dump (Cower) is not a very good option for hard mode dps races, and holding back dps early and mid-fight is an issue on the hard modes we're starting to knock down. The warrior tanks are either better geared or give me Vigilance. <br>
<br>
How can I help my DK tanks maximize their early-fight threat? The 2-3 DK tanks have somewhat widely ranging skill and gear levels. Depending on spec, what would the absolutely maximum early-fight (say, first 5-7 GCD's for the tank) threat generation look like for a Frost/Unholy/Blood tank, assuming MD and TotT are not available?<br>
<br>
Again, holding back early dps in the first 30sec is a bad solution in a few hard mode fights, though certainly the answer to some of my problems (I myself am not terribly skilled, but have learned enough to capitalize on the current OP feral dps).<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Feral dps (mostly) druid here finding myself constantly having extreme threat issues with DK tanks in my guild. My threat dump (Cower) is not a very good option for hard mode dps races, and holding back dps early and mid-fight is an issue on the hard modes we're starting to knock down. The warrior tanks are either better geared or give me Vigilance. <br>
<br>
How can I help my DK tanks maximize their early-fight threat? The 2-3 DK tanks have somewhat widely ranging skill and gear levels. Depending on spec, what would the absolutely maximum early-fight (say, first 5-7 GCD's for the tank) threat generation look like for a Frost/Unholy/Blood tank, assuming MD and TotT are not available?<br>
<br>
Again, holding back early dps in the first 30sec is a bad solution in a few hard mode fights, though certainly the answer to some of my problems (I myself am not terribly skilled, but have learned enough to capitalize on the current OP feral dps).<br>
<br>
Also, thanks Frmorrison for the info on Hysteria/Blood damage. Helped solve a bit of drama.</div>

</div>While your best bet is definitely to check out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100809232500/http://elitistjerks.com/f72/t44638-sunos_fireside_chat_dk_endgame_tanking_updated/" target="_blank">http://elitistjerks.com/f72/t44638-s...nking_updated/</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100809232500/http://elitistjerks.com/f72/t36998-dk_tanking_discussion/" target="_blank">DK Tanking Discussion</a> for death knight tanking information I can help summarize a little bit.<br>
<br>
First off, if you are doing HMs you need to be Blood or Frost, unholy is out of the question for fights which are threat sensitive.  Frost and Blood both share superior raw Mitigation (Frost &gt; Blood), Effective Health (Blood &gt; Frost), and definitely on TPS, effectively making Unholy the worst choice in almost all cases.  Frost may have higher base mitigation; however Blood has, by far, a larger benefit on Effective Health.  For hard modes Effective Health means more breathing room for healers, and the large benefit Blood provides over Frost in this regards pushes Blood above Frost overall.<br>
<br>
If Misdirect and Tricks of the Trade are not up for the tank then you, as a dps, need to understand that a DK needs his diseases up and to have about 5-10 seconds to finish the first half of his rotation before you should be able to go all out (similar to how mages need a few seconds to setup scorches to improve their primary nuke, etc.).<br>
<br>
Threat rotations are pretty much identical to dps rotations, with the exception of runic power dump phases.  The threat rotations are as follows...<br>
<br>
As Blood you maintain a rather static rotation.  Since all of Bloods cool downs use Blood Runes and you generally have 2 Bloods and 4 death Runes up most of the fight you can throw in the cool down pretty much anywhere, which is where I feel Blood really shines above Frost.  When I say 'dump phase' that means use death coil, however, unlike dps, as a tank you *only* use death coil if you are high on runic power (over 60 is generally where I will use one), this is important because our two non-Rune cool downs are Icebound Fortitude and Anti Magic Shell, which both require 20 RP to use, this is also important because Rune Strike (another Runic Power ability) is by far our greatest TPS tool.<br>
<br>
IT &gt; PS &gt; DS &gt; HS &gt; HS &gt; Dump Phase<br>
DS &gt; HS &gt; HS &gt; HS &gt; HS &gt; Dump Phase<br>
<br>
As Frost your rotation is much more of a priority system over a static rotation.  The priority system is as follows... Keep Frost Fever (IT Debuff) up at all times, use Frost Strike on Killing Machine procs and when you will be Runic Power capped if you use a Rune ability, use Howling Blast on Rime procs, make Blood Runes into Death Runes with Blood Strike and use Obliterate whenever the disease is up and you have a Frost Rune and Unholy Rune pair or Frost Rune and Death Rune, or Death Rune / Death Rune (unless your disease is about to expire).  Personally I use Howling Blast glyph, which means my rotation is greatly simplified as Howling Blast applies the Frost Fever debuff, making Icy Touch unnecessary.  If they decide to use HB glyph they should consider the following rotation, with similar priorities to the above...<br>
<br>
HB &gt; BS &gt; BS OB &gt; Dump Phase<br>
OB &gt; OB &gt; OB &gt; Dump Phase<br>
<br>
The main priority here is that you use Howling B in place of Obliterate whenever Frost Fever is about to go off.  Another reminder here is that Rime procs reset the cool down on Howling Blast and make the next Howling Blast consume no runes.  In the frost DPS topic there is a better explained idea as to how to use Howling Blast effectively in this rotation.<br>
<br>
Another big threat boost relies on talents.  The common specs used are present in both of the threads I linked above (since we are talking HMs, treat Suno's as a better guide than the standard tanking thread, considering it is high end oriented).<br>
<br>
The next biggest one, and the one I find most common with death knights, is that they are manually triggering Rune Strike rather than macro'ing it to commonly used abilities.  All spells your tank uses commonly should be replaced by a macro like this...<br>
<br>
#showtooltip &lt;Spell Name&gt;<br>
/cast !Rune Strike<br>
/cast &lt;Spell Name&gt;<br>
<br>
As an example to clear any confusion, it should be like this for Heart Strike...<br>
<br>
#showtooltip Heart Strike<br>
/cast !Rune Strike<br>
/cast Heart Strike<br>
<br>
The "!" before Rune Strike means that if the ability has been triggered (as Rune Strike is an 'on next melee swing' type attack, just like Heroic Strike / Bash) it won't deactivated by rapidly pressing buttons (where /cast Rune Strike will activate and deactivate the ability and reactivate it again based on button presses).<br>
<br>
I hope this helps you a little bit with getting your DK tanks on the right track, and be sure to check out the two threads I linked above for further assistance, they are full of great information.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1312883"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Im new to the deathknight class, and there is ALOT of great info in these forums!<br>
<br>
I do have a question, since the Deathknight forum doesnt have much on PVP, What are the pros and cons of each of the talent trees? I did some research and looked up all the Deathknights in the top 10 on 2v2 grps and 3v3 grps. and 95% of them are Unholy with close to the same build. I can see how the build would be effective. But i  would think its blood would be effective cause of its longevity. I tried out lvling as both blood and unholy and found i liked blood more. Maybe its cause its more my play style, i prefer survivablity to max dps. And i would expect to see more of these in upper pvp tiers.<br>
<br>
Anyway has anyone done testing with pvp.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Your armory currently shows you with quite a few pvp pieces, is this your actual raiding gear (hopefuly not) and what tier bonuses are you currently using?<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">No that's my pvp gear not my raiding gear. My current rotation is IT,PS,BSx2,SS,UB,SSx3,Rune dump,if scourge strike glyph procs, get BSx2,SSx2 next rotation. I throw my gargole in whenever it's up and try to max out RP before I use it to max it's time.  In aoe fights on trash I'm pulling top dps no problem but in boss fights I can't seem to beat some of the rogues and hunters but the other DK is. Trying to figure out why.</div>

</div>You want to use Garg when your weapon enchant procs at least instead of just blowing it on cooldown.   Using /cast Potion of Speed /cast Garg will help, and reading the Unholy thread for other tips.  Your situation sounds like a gear issue as well (you need some upgrades).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1314204"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Hi there, not sure if this is the right place to post this.. and I know this is probably the 572195729 "I need help with my dps" post that you guys have read, but having said that, I would really appreciate some advice on improving my dps in raids.<br>
<br>
First of all, some background info, am playing currently as a Blood (51/0/20) Blood Elf DK. I have been playing as a melee class (rogue) since Vanilla, thus, I am familiar with the basic rules of PvE dps. Have also been keeping myself fairly up-to-date on how to maximise PvE dps (eg. priority system, item weights for Blood, etcetc) by reading EJ fairly regularly.<br>
<br>
Recently, I have been finding myself posting poor numbers at single target bosses (usually last amongst melee classes by a substantial amount) and am wondering where have I gone wrong.<br>
<br>
With regards to my gear, I usually run with 4pc T8 with some other ArP pieces from Ulduar 10/25. I am aware of the 420ArP soft-cap (have Mjolnir Runestone) and Aesir's Edge hasn't been dropping for me. Am currently geared for hit cap but not expertise cap. <br>
<br>
Below is a parse from one of my XT hard mode fights (which I feel is one of the best ways to judge sustained melee dps, barring Gravity/Light bombs and ignoring Heart DPS):<br>
<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090722004613/http://www.wowmeteronline.com/combat/detail/158494699#damageout" target="_blank">WoW Meter Online - Combatlog Replay</a><br>
<br>
I understand that my rotation in that parse had some flaws (too few Heart Strikes / Death Coils and too many Death Strikes) in that parse as it was a rather frantic attempt for myself. With that notwithstanding, I am unsure as to why I am coming up with such numbers.<br>
<br>
To hazard a wild guess, I noticed that the number of skills performed (DS, HS, DC, etc) from my 09:23 kill was similar to the number of other DKs with shorter kill times, eg. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090722004613/http://www.wowmeteronline.com/combat/detail/158747099#damageout" target="_blank">WoW Meter Online - Combatlog Replay</a> or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090722004613/http://www.wowmeteronline.com/combat/detail/143781946#damageout" target="_blank">WoW Meter Online - Combatlog Replay</a>.<br>
<br>
FWIW, I am running on Oceanic ping (400 - 500ms) and have been finding few free GCDs even with the supposed loose rotation that Blood is supposed to have. <br>
<br>
Thus, I would really appreciate any feedback if there are any fundamental issues with my playstyle, rotation or gearing before I can further pinpoint what is hindering my dps.<br>
<br>
Apologies for the long post.<br>
<br>
Cheers<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Personally I take Spell Deflection myself given some of the content my guild and I are on at the moment. Many people prefer the "constant" effect that Subversion, Morbidity, etc provide given that Spell Deflection is a chance effect. In reality it's a personal preference. You are balancing potentially more mitigation against a specific type of damage versus an increase in overall threat. It depends what you and your guild are doing and your play style on which path you wish to take.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Thank you for the reply.  For my understanding, can you give me a few examples from Naxx and Ulduar of what constitute a DD spell and what does not (even though you take spell damage?)<br>

</div>Lotrafen's rating with under blood EAP is 2979.545, Aesir's is worth 2929.344 points *before* sockets are taken into consideration.  With double Bold Scarlet Ruby it is worth 3021.824, with a Bold Dragon's Eye and a Bold Scarlet Ruby it is worth 3070.954.  I have found that ~100 EAP matters very little in the scheme of an average gear set which is worth over 11,200, so take what you will from that.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Blood has the most non-magic damage. And all our strikes (non-magic) are based on weapon damage. So blood would not be a smart choice if you want dual wield. <br>

Frost is an option (gonna be the centric dual wield tree next build), since you can make a build that relies heavily on icy touch damage.<br>
<br>
Unholy is, at this moment, most likely your best option. You can make a build that revolves heavily around death coil damage.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>It's really a comparisson for the gloves only as Heroes Legplates are better stats wise.<br>
With the gloves the only question is will you be hit capped with Heroes as that's the only added benefit to the Battlegrips.  the 4pc bonus is a definite must as it provides a lot of free RP, so if you can get the hit somewhere else go for both Heroes pieces.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

You are below expertise cap.  next time u raid check and see if you have long strings of parries and dodges. expertise is more important for blood but you are currently low for even unholy.  if you can get around 20-21 expertise you should see a noticable increase.<br>

</div>Hi Blackmaji<br>
<br>
I'm fairly certain that expertise is not the main contributing factor as the 8 gcds (12s) that would have been avoided if I was expertise capped doesn't add up to the added time difference of almost 1 1/2 mins.<br>
<br>
Edit: I did some math based on information from the DW thread regarding latency and it appears that latency is indeed the contributing factor. <br>
<br>
Thanks for your time.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>The tooltip says it does whatever damage your dot did, upon it and all targets around it.<br>
<br>
Wandering Plague does not make your dots crit, it simply has a chance (equal to your crit) to do the damage you did again to all mobs around you.<br>
<br>
So if in 3.2 your dot crits, and then procs wandering plague it should do the critical damage to all mobs around you (so that makes 400% in that perspective).<br>
<br>
People often mistake Wandering Plague for a talent that makes your DoTs crit, but that's clearly not what the tooltip states. (Not implying you did, because you stated you read the tooltip, more a general remark)<br>
Pandemic (affliction lock) is a talent that makes dots crit, Wandering Plague is simply a talent to do the same damage twice. (There is a distinct difference in that <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20091120093715im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/wink.gif" border="0" alt="" title=";)" class="inlineimg"> )<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Actually two questions:<br>
<br>
1. When I hit a Mob, particularly a boss, with Froststrike, they sometimes resist the Damage partially (mostly 25%, I think). Since this is a severe DPS loss, is there any way to prevent this from happening? Do I need spell penetration (if so, is it reasonable to go for it in PvE content?)? Do I need to be beyond the melee hit cap of 8%, or is the damage even related to the spell hit cap?<br>
<br>
2. With 3.2 coming up, is it reasonable to aim for a +melee hit chance around 20% or is this just overshooting things? I guess +hit plays a bigger role in this build, the question I'm asking myself, however, is, if it's that important that I want it, even if I'm already at 10% hit or so.</div>

	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>1. You can't overcome that, not even by spell penetration. This is a resistance based on level difference, since the boss is 3 levels higher than you. Spell Penetration only works on actual resistance, which you won't see often in pve content.<br>
<br>
2. Assuming any random dual wield build. More than special hitcap is overkill. <br>
<br>
Get to the special hitcap (8%), between special and spell hitcap (17%) hitrating is ok but not better than most other stats. After the spell hit cap your hitrating will only improve white melee hits, and hitrating becomes a very bad stat. <br>
<br>
Treat dual wield hitcaps like you would 2H. Try to get above 8%, anything more than that is dps wise not smart going for.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">1. all the bosses have some amount of resistances, these arent calculated through hit, but as you said it is spell penetration, dont gem for it, gemming for strength wil see a bigger increase, Frost strike and Scourge are considered as magic damage not mitigated by armour but resistances.</div>

</div>PvP is rarely the same as PvE.  In PvP, there is Mark of the Wild and Shadow Resist, talents, and Paladin Auras.  It is good to have some spell penetration in PvP, but you want 0 in PvE because mobs don't have those player buffs.<br>
<br>
Also having capped weapon skill helps with partial resists.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">The tooltip says it does whatever damage your dot did, upon it and all targets around it.<br>
<br>
Wandering Plague does not make your dots crit, it simply has a chance (equal to your crit) to do the damage you did again to all mobs around you.<br>
<br>
So if in 3.2 your dot crits, and then procs wandering plague it should do the critical damage to all mobs around you (so that makes 400% in that perspective).<br>
<br>
People often mistake Wandering Plague for a talent that makes your DoTs crit, but that's clearly not what the tooltip states. (Not implying you did, because you stated you read the tooltip, more a general remark)<br>
Pandemic (affliction lock) is a talent that makes dots crit, Wandering Plague is simply a talent to do the same damage twice.

Yeah, I realize it's only a simulated crit ( but better ) , I just wasn't sure if a double proc would do 4x disease damage or only 3x, didn't know how WP was calculated.<br>

One more quick one though I haven't been able to find, are the disease modifiers on strikes effected by talents and glyphs? Does GoOblit turn the disease bonus from 12.5% into 15% for instance?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

My problem is that the weapons I sit on are <a id="itemlink" class="q4" style=" font-weight: bold;" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091120093715/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=40402" target="_blank">[Last Laugh]</a>, <a id="itemlink" class="q4" style=" font-weight: bold;" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091120093715/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=40491" target="_blank">[Hailstorm]</a>, <a id="itemlink" class="q4" style=" font-weight: bold;" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091120093715/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=45110" target="_blank">[Titanguard]</a> and <a id="itemlink" class="q4" style=" font-weight: bold;" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091120093715/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=45142" target="_blank">[Remorse]</a><br>
<br>
Seeing as they are all fast weapons and Frost demands slow ones I was wondering if it would be better for me DPS wise to ignore those four and spend some Champion's seals on 2x<a id="itemlink" class="q4" style=" font-weight: bold;" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091120093715/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=45075" target="_blank">[Ironforge Smasher]</a> instead until I can get some nice slow weapons from Ulduar and the new raids.<br>

		<div id="post_message_1335976"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Hello. Currently I stick to frost spec and avoid using ArP gear (but still banking items if nobody needs them). Atm I have 3 items with ArP and soon I'll be able to buy neck for EoC (<a id="itemlink" class="q4" style=" font-weight: bold;" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091120093715/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=45820" target="_blank">[Broach of the Wailing Night]</a>). It will give me about 17% of ArP from items. I consider this to be enough to respec to blood. But soon the patch will go live and Frost will be changed to DW.<br>
<br>
My question is: what would be better for dps?<br>
<br>
1) To respec to Blood, buy <a id="itemlink" class="q4" style=" font-weight: bold;" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091120093715/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=45820" target="_blank">[Broach of the Wailing Night]</a> and to try find more gear with ArP. My weapon would be <a id="itemlink" class="q4" style=" font-weight: bold;" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091120093715/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=40384" target="_blank">[Betrayer of Humanity]</a> still.<br>
<br>
2) To respec to DW Frost, get <a id="itemlink" class="q4" style=" font-weight: bold;" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091120093715/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=45819" target="_blank">[Spiked Battleguard Choker]</a>, change +hit gems with +str and to avoid gear with ArP. My weapons would be: <a id="itemlink" class="q4" style=" font-weight: bold;" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091120093715/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=45266" target="_blank">[Malice]</a> and <a id="itemlink" class="q4" style=" font-weight: bold;" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091120093715/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=45298" target="_blank">[Razorscale Talon]</a>.<br>
<br>
Another question is: since new Frost DW spec uses a lot of OBs, would it benefit from ArP? Should I still avoid ArP as Frost?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>According to some simulations (the link is given in the 3.2 DW first post), and also to logic (obliterate supposedly being the most powerful attack in 3.2 Frost DW), ArP should be interesting (IIRC, it is even the most interesting stat after strength and expertise/hit caps).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1339087"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Like the above poster, I too am having trouble finding a new dps spec. Research has brought good information but I'm having trouble interpreting it. After pouring through the latest pages on Unholy, Blood, Frost and DW specs (probably more than some 35 pages of good material) I've come to a few conclusions.<br>
<br>
There's a great unholy build suggested, but I don't think my current gear level can hold it. I'm new to the game, and came here to research my first DK. I chose unholy and started gearing it in heroics, then the patch hit. I was previously getting ~2k dps in my mediocre gear or more as I gained skill. Now my gear hits terrible numbers (1400, 1600 etc. It's bad news.)<br>
<br>
If I understand correctly, there are some already ptr-tested DW builds that are rocking out damage in 3.2. The catch is, I don't know if they'll scale with my gear. (Or if I can easily afford appropriate 1-handers since I was rocking 2H before.)<br>
<font size="1">*Note: I tried to figure this out on my own by the given rotation/stat-weight math, <b>However</b> I found a lot of the equations to be over my head. I'm decent at math, but these guys are too smart math-wise for me.</font><br>
<br>
My question is: Is there a yet-known DK DPS build that scales really well to low level gear?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
My DK (Vivax on Feathermoon) has recently started raiding casually,  and has gotten some nice upgrades from 25 Naxx and Ulduar.  With the arrival of 3.2, I'm trying the Frost DW spec and would like some advice on how I can better optimize my gear. From reading the forums, Strength is one of the most important stats for a DK, so I've been focusing on increasing that and crit, since I'm capped on hit.  <br>
<br>
My main challenge is getting pieces that have a nice upgrade in Strength, WITHOUT a ton of Stamina. Most pieces seem to have STAM &gt;&gt; STR.  So while my total strength has increased, my stamina has by far outgrown it!  So currently a BiS item like the Darkmoon Greatness card would be useless, since fully buffed I have almost 210 more Stamina than Strength... Not sure what I'm doing wrong... I'm gemming mostly + 16 Str gems in almost all slots, and while this has improved things, it's still hasn't solved my problem.<br>
<br>
Thanks for your help/advice you can give me.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I'm sorry, this is more a spec directed at a mod than at DKs, but when using a mod like Recount with Threat of Thassarian, does it count the handed strikes separately ?

		<div id="post_message_1341861"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->So I have a couple issues, but have been nervous to bring them up since my last post got a warning on it.<br>
<br>
I currently am specced as 53/18 and dual wielding. The aim of the dual wield build that I had before 3.2, which rocketed me to the top of the DPS chart, was slow/fast, but my fast/fast was better than any slow I had, so I used <a id="itemlink" class="q4" style=" font-weight: bold;" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091212191141/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=40264" target="_blank">[Split Greathammer]</a>x2 which worked great. These are the only epic one handers I have. So I went and bought <a id="itemlink" class="q3" style=" font-weight: bold;" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091212191141/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=44250" target="_blank">[Reaper of Dark Souls]</a> because of the higher overall damage than the Greathammers. This upped my DPS but I'm still not seeing any fruition that would keep me from a two-handed build. I'm following the description on the first post here: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091212191141/http://elitistjerks.com/f72/t64830-dw_builds_3_2_revenge_offhand/" target="_blank">DW Builds 3.2 -Revenge of the Offhand</a>.<br>
<br>
So the overall first question is, is there a viable AoE DPS dual wield build that I could use. I've seen 13/55/3 linked to in the thread I linked earlier, but there is no mention of a rotation or priority. If this query doesn't produce results for rotation etc. I will sit down and figure out the best rotation myself, but I'm not too good at it.<br>
<br>
This leads me to my second question. How exactly does one follow a priority rotation? I can't seem to figure it out, but I'm sure its because I'm thinking too small and forcing myself to only consider that I would mash buttons in a certain order, and that order would be static. For instance, we'll take the Priority Rotation that is provided in the revenge of the offhand for the spec that I'm using.<br>
<br>
To start with, here is the rotation that I've been using for this spec: PS &gt; IT &gt; OB &gt; BS &gt; BS &gt; FSDUMP; OB &gt; OB &gt; OB &gt; FSDUMP I'm not sure as that this is a rotation that produces the most DPS, but I'll get to that in my last question.<br>
<br>

	<div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom:0px"><img src="/web/20091212191141im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/chestnut/misc/citation.gif" border="0"></div>

				Priority Rotation (most important at the top):<br>

- Blood Plague<br>

		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>Frost Fever and Blood Plague or both diseases, and these are applied most often with PS and IT. So I get those. Killing Machine + Rime. So if both of these have procced, do I use howling blast? There is a lot of talk in the dual wield thread about matching up KM and Rime to hit at the same time. The only thing that would benefit from that is a howling blast, but howling blast is not mentioned anywhere. Most of us aren't stupid, so I guess we would figure out that it was implied, but I'm not quite sure. So for now I'll assume its howling blast. Next is OB, then BS then FS. Are we supposed to follow this as we do these moves whenever they come off cooldown? That doesn't make sense to me because for instance, before the first OB, we've only used PS and IT once, and therefore still have a plague rune and a frost rune, which we COULD use to do these again.<br>
<br>
I'm sorry, I realize my previous babbling may qualify me as an idiot, but I would appreciate any light that could be shone on this.<br>
<br>
Last question, which is sort of specific to the dual wield thread: when I'm doing my rotation I find that when I get to the OBx3, I can only do two one right after the other, and then have to wait for the last one. This could be from the rune glitching mentioned previously in this thread, but I'm not sure. It usually forces me to hit a FS before the last OB which throws the rhythm of the rotation off. Has anyone else experienced that? It could be due to my excessive amount of button mashing, and it has worked a little better when I slow down, but I have to button mash for fights like Grobb because I'm constantly moving.<br>
<br>
tl;dr: HALP!<br>
<br>
Thanks in advance for any help.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1341955"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Lately I've been having DPS issues, and it deals with global cool down (GCD) usage.  My preferred style of using my abilities is to physically hit the key when it is ready (off GCD).  But I find that sometimes I clip the GCD when I press the key too early that results in an error message instead of the ability being used, which requires me to hit the key again and generates a delay.  I've tried holding down the key followed by a release and have had minimal success as movement heavy fights tend to disturb this process.  I do key bind all of my abilities as well.<br>
<br>
I'm not sure if I explained my problem correctly but what I'm looking for is how other Death Knights have their binds setup and how to you ensure the most efficient GCD usage so that none of your abilities are clipped while DPSing?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1342472"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Naerys - in essence, every GCD you look at your runic power, your avaliable runes, your procs and then you decide what to do. In theory the rotation you posted is the one you should be following, in practise you'll probably weave in frost strike between obliterates in the second rotation for instance. And yes "KM Rime" means casting Howling Blast when you have both procs up (a non-KM HB is a waste of a GCD, so you delay Rime procs until you get a KM proc).<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">In tanking: 5 points on Bladed Armor or 5 points on Necrosis? I wouldn't think of it 1 moment if it was on Blood Presence, but in tanking Bladed Armor gives an AP value that goes beyond 700. However, it doesn't scale at all with almost anything while Necrosis does. What is realistically the best in a 10-man raid?<br>

(At the moment I favor Bladed Armor not because it's technically better but because Necrosis is useless in AOE tanking)</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Naerys - in essence, every GCD you look at your runic power, your avaliable runes, your procs and then you decide what to do. In theory the rotation you posted is the one you should be following, in practise you'll probably weave in frost strike between obliterates in the second rotation for instance. And yes "KM Rime" means casting Howling Blast when you have both procs up (a non-KM HB is a waste of a GCD, so you delay Rime procs until you get a KM proc).<br>

</div>There are no set in stone tanking weights.  Why?  Because tanking can go multiple routes.  You can go for maximum effective health, mitigation, avoidance, threat, etc.  In addition to this there is diminishing returns on the two dominant stats for tanks - dodge and parry rating.  Most tanks carry around a few extra pieces to swap out variant on the fight.  As an example I used to go for maximum effective health when I would tank HM Steelbreaker, because threat was not an issue and living through Fusion Punches was.  For Normal Vezax I had a balanced set of threat gear and effective health, as casters standing in Shadow Crashes can put out a good... 16k+ TPS.  For HM Vezax you put on maximum effective health gear because threat is a non-issue as casters are not casting unless they have a crash under them.<br>
<br>
Pure avoidance sets are next to unheard of.  Why?  Effective health is superior, it gives you more cushion for your healers to top you off.  Avoidance is risky, you can have a string of 10 dodge / parry / misses, or you can get hit 3 consecutive times and die.  Consistency is key when it comes to tanking, especially with stress on healers.  Letting them know what to expect is beneficial to the raid.  That all being sad, my primary tanking set has a mixture of effective health and threat generation gear.<br>
<br>
If you are interested in what kinds of items to look for in end game terms take a look here: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091212122230/http://elitistjerks.com/f72/t44638-sunos_fireside_chat_dk_endgame_tanking_updated/" target="_blank">http://elitistjerks.com/f72/t44638-s...nking_updated/</a><br>
<br>
At the bottom of the first post it has a set of gear for effective health, avoidance, threat, and then pre-heroic hard mode gear (ie gear to get you ready for hard mode, generally balanced but pretty much effective health oriented).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Personally I run with a very solid Blood set (~440 Armor Penetration, ~4600 AP, ~28% Crit, 296 Hit, 17 Expertise, and Runestone) and even with less than optimal DW gear my double Vulmir DW setup is out performing Blood the more and more familiar I become with the spec.  If you trust simulators then DW frost is miles ahead of Blood (placing my DW setup about 1k dps above my Blood setup in Kahorie's Simulator).  From everything I have seen Frost DW &gt; Blood &gt; Unholy DW &gt; Unholy Obliterate in terms of personal DPS.  The DW Frost setup has a large portion of its damage affected by Armor Penetration (just like 2h Frost OB heavy builds did in 3.1), so the transition from Blood to DW Frost is easy to make and effective.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
It seems to me that if the Death Strikes came earlier, you would guarantee Abomination's Might being up more consistently.  Or if they came in the middle of the segment, you would have enough runic power for the glyph.  The second DS comes after the Runic power dump, which I think means you may have less than 25 runic power.<br>

Edit: Nevermind, I understand, you can't move the second pair of Heart Strikes forward because there are no Death/Blood runes to power them.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Gemming for strength is a better investment in raw dps.  The trade-off, however, is that your strikes will be less consistent which will throw off your rotation a bit and jumble you up (in particular with blood, as we use so many single rune abilities in a given rotation).  It is best to aim to pick up something with expertise on it, but it isn't worth regemming your gear from str to exp.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Yes, you want to always use a 3% crit damage meta.<br>
<br>
Regarding the previous question of which threat talents to get, most Blood tanks likely get MoM because the crit damage helps with AoE and single target threat (others are single target only) and the talent is most "fun" of the four talents.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1346334"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->The 3% damage boost applies.  It has been stated that the crit from agi does not affect your spell crit rate.  The plus to getting the RED is you only have to sacrifice one slot fulfill the meta requirements.  <br>
<br>
The difference is, is it more worthwhile to go with 1 less mixed color gem at the expense of some spell crit rating?  (This is a rhetorical question that is left up to you to answer; in reality, we're splitting hairs here over less than 1% damage difference.)<br>

</div>You are misguided by the number. 9% more crit on obliterate does not even come close to something like 9% more dps.<br>
<br>
9% crit on obliterate equals about 6% extra obliterate damage. (Ask if you want extended math on this, or look it up, i posted it somewhere around page 50 in the DW thread)<br>
<br>
6% extra damage on an ability that is ~33% of your dps means about 2% more dps for 3 talent points.<br>
That means about 0.66% per talent point.<br>
<br>
It's a bit more ( about 0.8% ) since it also affects bloodstrike, and the thread reduction is nice too.<br>
<br>
But blood caked blades is not 1.2% dps, its a bit more. I think you forget to count it hits on both weapons.<br>
It averages around 2.4%, which is 0.8% dps per point as well.<br>
<br>
I personally prefer Subversion, because of the thread reduction, but mostly because its more stable. BCB has the tendency to be 5% of your dps on one fight and 1.5% on the next.<br>
<br>
But don't overestimate subversion, just because 9% crit seems to be a lot, it doesn't mean the talent is that good.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">ty for the reply.  There is a lot of discussion right now in the DW thread about whether to take UA or not due to the complexities of working it into the rotation without messing up your runes.  There may or may not be some macros that can make it worthwhile - but I haven't read that far into the thread yet <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20091115004938im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":)" class="inlineimg"></div>

</div>Once you know the rotation better it's probably worth it. It can only be popped at certain parts in your rotation though, which makes it a bit less flexible.<br>
<br>
I think the only cooldowns frost really has that you can effectively pop when burst is needed are Raise Dead and Unbreakable Armor, both are quite mediocre compared to DRW and GG though.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I'm not sure which will yeild the better results for Frost spec: DW tanking vs 2h tanking and secondly, (for my dual spec) DW DPS vs 2h DPS.<br>

Due to the fact that I work 50 hrs a week and have 2 kids, I'd like to keep it constistant to save time (farming, gemming, etc) so DW tanking with DW DPS? or 2h with 2h?) but that's not such a big deal.<br>

		<div id="post_message_1351137"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Frost's AOE threat is better, but blood will have superior single-target threat. Both are with 2H - DW tanking is suboptimal and has poor threat generation. For frost DPS, DW will probably win out.<br>

The three specs are probably closer now than ever in tank viability and DPS, so as always, you should take into account what buffs you need to bring that your raid group might otherwise be missing.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I'm going to give 2 cents, nothing more. According to the latest version of the simulator, common values show DW DPS Frost to be the best (in 3.2). However, this is definitely not a consensus opinion so don't take this as a definite answer in any way. Personally I see a utility advantage in frost DPSing: It's simple to use compared to Unholy - i.e. less error prone - and in my humble opinion more fun than blood. <br>
<br>
In tanking I wouldn't go to DW easily, even if my MS is tanking and usually frost. The main reasons are a) Stoneskin Gargoyle - which is optimally used on 565 defence (540 base + its own but undiminished 25) b) Leaving talent points that would be otherwise used in DW free for important utility tanking talents - at least to my experience - such as reduced CD in DnD.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Let me add, for his needs it's 5% hit only since he's using a DW spec that bufs hitting by 3% even in specials (this will be shown as 5% on the character pane).<br>
<br>
Also, Expertise is more valuable that Strength until it's 26 (this will be shown as 26 on the character pane even with Tundra Stalker (unlike Hit bonus that doesn't seem to reach the char pane)).<br>
<br>
It appears that the priorities in DW Frost are: Hit skill until 5% (value as it appears on the char pane) -&gt; Expertise skill until 26 (value as it appears on the char pane) -&gt; Strength.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>     Thats exactly why I'm asking; during Vezaxx fight, you are constantly getting damaged, you cannot guarantee it wont overheal, but there are no other adds (at least not until the saronite spawns, and by then all dps will switch to it), and it certainly helps the healers. If 2 HS produce more threat, I rather stay with them, because my main concern in the fight is threat, but if a DS + the healing of it produces the same threat, then I think it would be wise for me to do it instead.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

So, with my gear should I go 2 1h Frost build, 2h Unholy (personal DPS) or 2h Blood (raid boost)?<br>
<br>
Thanks for the assistance!<br>

</div>The first thing is to cover what buffs are missing from your group.  If you don't have a source of 10% AP, 2H Blood is an outstanding choice. Assuming all DK buffs are covered (10% AP, 20% melee haste, or 13% magic damage), pick which one you like best.  <br>
<br>
Since you get 3% free hit with DW, that may be the best pick (since you may not be hit capped) if you don't have to bring a raid buff.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>If you weren't Blood then the answer would likely get the Sigil.  Personally since I have the new relic, I am collecting badges to next buy two pieces of 245 gear, since the 2 piece is pretty nice, about a 3% dps increase. To which one Tier pieces to replace, I would compare the dps difference in Rawr, which will depend on your current items.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
Whats the better Pally Blessing for a Dps Dk (Blood).. I don't know if being blood has any relevence to the type of blessing, but just incase it is. The blessings im reffering to are [Greater Blessing of Might] and [Greater Blessing of Kings]. Ofcourse im only asking this question for those times that there are no two pallies. Like 5 Mans and such. Anyone's help would be appreciated, and especially someone that can tell me exactly why they decided on one.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
Unimproved Blessing of Might gives 550 ap. This means that, for Kings to be better, you would need to have at least 1897 strength or more. <br>
<br>
Improved Blessing of Might gives 688 ap. This means that, for Kings to be better, you would need to have at least 2382 strength or more.<br>

So, with your gear, Blessing of Might is probably going to be superior in the majority of cases, but those are the values at which BoK would surpass it, for future reference.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>It's said throughout the forum that DPS testing on dumies is a poor method of testing, with one of the main reasons being that necrosis doesn't work. This has an even larger effect on DW, because of the increase in damage from your melée hits, and consequently necrosis. Also don't forget that you need to focus on quite different stats for DW. Expertise, hit and armor pen play a different role. You can't just equip two 1h weps with your 2h gear and expect to rock the DPS meters<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I agree that DS &gt; OB in 51/0/20 blood spec, but you can use an OB just before using IT and PS.<br>
<br>
The cycle I use is : OB IT PS HS HS dc - HS HS DS HS HS dc dc<br>
The advantage of that cycle is that OB have a +25% bonus with the deseases, and you delete them just before re-applying them. I agree when you say that OB &lt; DS, even with the deseases, but you gain 200 strengh, which is really interesting.<br>
<br>
You don't need an OB spec, and the 200 strengh bonus is permanent if you apply OB every 20 sec..<br>
In my opinion that sigil is the best for a blood spec (but I can be wrong xD).<br>
<br>
<br>
Edit : I have a question too, it's about the expertise rating.<br>
I'm a human with a 2H sword. My expertise cap is around 140 expertise rating (139.something), but I don't know how does it works oO.<br>
Is 138 expertise rating "enough", or do I have to be over 140 ?<br>
I can also ask : 140 exp. rat. = 6.5%. But is 138 = 6.25% or 6.4% ?<br>
<br>
      Edit 2 : in short, what I'd like to know is that if expertise works as an affine function or as a step function ?<br>

Regarding expertise, you're rating will only go up every ~8 ish rating, which means anything from point one and up is worthless if it isn't 8 points (as an example 173 expertise rating is 21 expertise, but I drop down to 20 expertise from 172 to 165 expertise rating, making anything over 165 essentially 'worthless' as it doesn't add a point of expertise).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1360717"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->It's literally impossible for anyone to have 4p t9 yet. With the limited amount of emblems which one could have received by now (I believe you should be up to something like 76 if you haven't spent any/done every available boss each week in both 10 and 25/done the heroic daily each day) and with hard mode tokens not yet being accessible, it just isn't possible.<br>
<br>
The crit chance is not 15%. That was someone who doesn't/didn't know how to read spell descriptions and codes on Wowhead. The crit rate should just be whatever yours is - although whether it is your melee or your spell is still undetermined (although either way, the set bonus is incredible for any spec, and most likely making 4p t9 BiS).  <br>
<br>
The crit modifier being 200% is a pretty safe bet, whether or not it works off of melee or spell crit. If it's melee, it's 200% by default. If it's a spell, it's affected by Runic Focus, and thus still 200%.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Personally I would say hitting the 4pc t9 quickly is worth more than getting the off piece (which is comparable).  In addition to this, the t9 helm is more of a 'universal' helm than the badge off piece helm is due to the stat weight of armor penetration, making it useful if you choose to respec, where the badge helm would not.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>That wouldn't explain why his DC is hitting so low. My only guess for DC is partial resists. Other factors include: the DRW doesn't benefit from buffs after you cast it, so if your trinket happened to proc after you cast DRW then that would cause a minor discrepancy. Lastly for the heart strikes specifically, it be because you didn't cast diseases with DRW up so it's heart strike didn't have its own disease bonus.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I can't comment on your damage intake, I've found no problem with damage mitigation but then I am blood spec with improved blood presence. I find that the buff to disease damage adds to my self healing. I've always considered the self healing aspect of blood tanking to be a major part of its mitigation--and it works.<br>
<br>
As for your threat you are below hit cap by almost 2% and you are at only 17 expertise. You should aim for at least 26 expertise and even then you can benefit from more as a tank. 26 expertise helps to prevent your attacks being dodged but it does not completely remove parries.<br>
<br>
A draenei can add to some of your hit, as would a shadow priest or boomkin but if you do not have these in your regular raid composition, you should invest in some hit gems until you have gear with hit on it.<br>
You definitely need some expertise gems as ensuring your attacks are not dodged or parried will add to your threat.<br>
Always ensure you have horn of winter up and remember Unbreakable Armour can be used as a threat cooldown as well as a mitigation cooldown. Use your best judgement to discern when to save it and when to use it.<br>
<br>
Are you keeping frostfever up? That gives 15% more damage to all your abilities including Rune Strike.<br>

</div>- Since 3.1, damage done by DRW is reduced by 50%.<br>
- DRW do not benefit from glyph.<br>
- DRW do not benefit from Blood gorged.<br>
- DRW do not benefit from sigil.<br>
- DRW do not benefit Blood Presence<br>
<br>
Taking as sample this random log <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090828134501/http://www.wowmeteronline.com/combat/detail/166205715#damageout" target="_blank">WoW Meter Online - Combatlog Replay</a><br>
Average non crit Death Coil of this player is at around 3100 and DRW at 900 and he don't have glyph of dark death.<br>
From this 3100, I remove  Blood gorged, Blood Presence, 2 point in morbididy, then remove sigil and divide by 2.<br>
((3100/ 1.10*1.15*1.10 ) -  380)  /2 = 923. <br>

		<div id="post_message_1362678"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I need a bit of info for the BiS thread, but it's possibly too dumb a question to ask in the Blood DPS thread. I couldn't find a recent answer anyway.<br>
<br>
The current Blood BiS sets all have static ArPen at around the 420 mark, which then obviously comes close to the hard cap once Mjolnir Runestone procs. But what I want to know is, is it worth my while adding in a secondary set for Blood where you do not have Mjolnir? <br>
<br>
Presumably it would involve getting as much static ArPen as possible from gear, then gemming ArPen to the hard cap and gemming strength after that. However I know when I was still playing around the time 3.1 hit, for Blood specs ArPen had a stat weight quite close to strength but it was not advisable to gem for it. <span style="text-decoration:line-through">However according to Zerack's optimizer, its stat weight now seems to be way above str, so is that still the case?</span><br>
<br>
edit: okay, in the build I was looking at last night, the ArPen value was like double the str value, but in the new optimizer build it now has a weight slightly lower than str again. So I guess the second question is now: Is the old advice to gem for str over ArPen still correct then, even if you're aiming to reach the hardcap without trinket procs?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I consider swordshattering a pvp rune. Stoneskin Gargoyle gives you much more freedom to gem for hit and expertise. One you have enough hit and expertise you can gem for stamina and or avoidance, if you so wish.<br>
<br>
for blood aoe, death and decay (I spec into morbidity)and blood boil work fine for me except in the arena part of Thorim on 10 man. I change to frost just for the aoe. Thankfully I only ever had to do it once. I love heart strike as its a cleave.<br>
<br>
Be sure to communicate with your raid, tell them to give you two seconds to spread diseases and hit the mobs with a blood boil. If you stay frost, you can rival a paladin with aoe.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Actually, no "good" DK uses Swordshattering for PvP (that is partly because IT and DC are so good atm).  <br>
<br>
Regarding threat issues, all DKs have two taunts (Death Grip only works a few seconds, but it is usually enough), and the dps need to learn to wait 2 seconds for diseases to spread.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I need a bit of info for the BiS thread, but it's possibly too dumb a question to ask in the Blood DPS thread. I couldn't find a recent answer anyway.<br>
<br>
The current Blood BiS sets all have static ArPen at around the 420 mark, which then obviously comes close to the hard cap once Mjolnir Runestone procs. But what I want to know is, is it worth my while adding in a secondary set for Blood where you do not have Mjolnir? <br>
<br>
Presumably it would involve getting as much static ArPen as possible from gear, then gemming ArPen to the hard cap and gemming strength after that. However I know when I was still playing around the time 3.1 hit, for Blood specs ArPen had a stat weight quite close to strength but it was not advisable to gem for it. <span style="text-decoration:line-through">However according to Zerack's optimizer, its stat weight now seems to be way above str, so is that still the case?</span><br>
<br>
edit: okay, in the build I was looking at last night, the ArPen value was like double the str value, but in the new optimizer build it now has a weight slightly lower than str again. So I guess the second question is now: Is the old advice to gem for str over ArPen still correct then, even if you're aiming to reach the hardcap without trinket procs?</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>Before we were pretty easily soft capping ArP, it was proper to gem str until you hit around 6200 raid buffed AP, then people would start switching to ArP.  Mainy because ArP in small amounts isn't very good, but it gets better the higher your AP, and is really good when you can stack it, soft cap it, etc.  I would say this standard would hold true for people without the ArP proc trinkets.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

You can throw an extra DC in at the end, if you have extra RP from AMS, a resto druid, a disc priest, or whatever. As well, you also have the option of switching your first two Blood Strikes with your first Obliterate, however if/once you have SoVirulence. Although the Desolation affecting a Blood Strike and an Oblit might be superior to the SoVir proc affecting the two Blood Strikes, due to the 10 second ICD of the Sigil, using it before the Blood Strikes means it has a chance to proc sooner than it would if you did that first Oblit after the BSes, which leads to directly higher uptime (while Desolation's uptime is the same with either order). Minute differences either way, but still.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>It's the 2nd or 3rd time I notice someone talking about Algalon being hard to be tanked by DKs. It's most probably right; as a fast hitting boss it makes avoidance and block more valuable.<br>
<br>
Noting: In my opinion what should not be overlooked is the armor nerf. A point of armor is approximately equivalent to a point of health for physical damage (meaning indestructible potion is like giving +3500HP when tanking physical damage (plus easier healing)). Hence death knights lost not just HP from blood, not just HP from presence, but also effective HP from armor when tanking physical.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

This is only considering the Strength component though... I realize other stats are not nearly as good as strength, but perhaps only having say 1895 STR (using such a small difference for example) would still merit kings, because of agility's crit (and stam might be helpful for incoming aoe fights). I wonder at what point kings would surpass might taking into consideration agility's small role.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Don't forget that you get another 155 from HoW (or 178 from talented SoE).  Many people also use an agi weapon/cloak/neck/ring, as it is quite possible for the four dps stats to outpace the higher value of strength.  While it's rarely optimal, it can serve a good interim place too when people don't have the BiS strength item.<br>
<br>
Not that this changes things a lot more (might/battle shout will still always be a larger dps increase than kings), but you'll always have 300 or so agi in a raid even without agi gear.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1367272"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Just a quick question about blood rotation. The standard rotation in the blood thread is:<br>
IT-PS-HS-HS-DS -DUMP- DS-HS-HS-HS-HS -Dump-<br>
<br>
However sometimes I see myself with 2 blood runes and 2 death runes after I restart with IT and PS and what I end up doing is HSx4 at the beginning of my rotation instead of at the end. So it ends up like this:<br>
<br>
IT-PS-HS-HS-HS-HS-DS-DUMPx1-HS-HS-DS-DUMPx2<br>
<br>
Is this a lesser dps rotation? I still have room for dump phases and my DS still always have atleast 25 RP. Infact sometimes with the 2nd DS in the standard rotation I see myself with only 20RP and I'm losing 5% extra damage on it because the first dump phase generally has 2 GCD's worth of time for 2 DC's.<br>
<br>
I also noticed that if you start with: (suggested starting rotation from blood thread)<br>
DS-IT-PS-HS-HS--Raise Ghoul-DC-HS-HS-DS-HS-HS -Dump<br>
<br>
You finish off with 2 deathrunes, 2 bloodrunes, and U/Fx1 left for IT and PS so you can go right into HSx4 at the start of your rotation anyways.<br>
<br>
So my question is, would doing this rotation be a loss of DPS?<br>
<br>
[edit] I guess this wasn't answered, so I will re-post this in the blood forum soon, unless doing so would violate any sort of forum rules that I don't know about.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Try putting points into improved blood presence. Sure, people might laugh at you and I have no doubt many will laugh at me saying this but I have it and people find me to be one of the easiest tanks to heal. Remember that they buffed disease damage. I now see my self healing from diseases alone to be more healing than what I'd get from having a shadow priest in my group (I usually don't, my guild is strict ten man).<br>
<br>
Also it scales with vampiric blood.<br>
<br>
The self healing you gain from the damage you do, combined with the heals from death strike mean I mitigate alot of damage by healing myself. The very least you can do is try it, also you might want to consider using four pieces of T8.5 if you have it, the 4pc set bonus is nothing short of amazing. At least it is to me.<br>
<br>
I find I have a little less health but better survivability since 3.2.<br>
<br>
I noticed you do not have mark of blood, this is an amazing tank cooldown that can also be used to heal others during encounters with frequent raid damage. If you chain vampiric blood with mark of blood, your healer can practically go afk for the duration.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
However, there's a high limitation in those methods: you have to assume it's for fights where there is minimal overhealing and the HP bar is largely on the 50-90% side. This is very hard to happen in most hard hitting bosses, especially if it's a 25-man with several healers spamming at once. <br>
<br>
It may be more beneficial in 10-mans and when the Healing arrangement is generally less on the overhealing side.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I realize the technical superiority of RT, however it has a utility disadvantage, it not passive. This may be of course a personal preference but I prefer passive improvements to active ones unless the active ones are significantly better after flatting out the gains over time. Since 4 points are needed before RT is considerable help, I'd 1st go to Mark of Blood since it's 1 single point for 80% HP healing over a relatively short time. Its CD is long but it can be considered another 'soft o-shit' CD like Vampiric Blood. It won't save from a severe enrage but it's decent healing help. I'd prefer RT first but 4 points make it too expensive. I'd rather go to 4 threat points when it's merely a CD and not a passive improvement.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1369272"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I've another question that came up when playing my DK. (Btw thanks for the answers on my DRW damage question).<br>
<br>
I found out that my DS heals me no matter if there is any disease on the target or not. Tooltip however says<br>
<br>
Quote: "A deadly attack that deals 97 to 98% weapon damage plus 374 and heals the Death Knight for 5% of his maximum health <b>for each of his diseases on the target</b>."<br>
<br>
Now what I found out that a DS without any diseases heals me for 7.5% of my hp (2.5% coming from the DS talent it seems). The crazy thing is, that it doesn't heal me all the time - and it doesnt seem to work on all mobs.<br>
<br>
Here a combatlog copy paste:<br>
(first line shows that there was no attacks (diseases) beforehand on the mob)<br>
<br>
10:27:59&gt; [Your] Blood Presence healed [You] 83 Physical. <br>
10:28:37&gt; [Your] Bloody Vengeance applied [You]. <br>
10:28:37&gt; [Your] Melee hit [Dark Zealot] 3850 Physical. (Critical)<br>
10:28:38&gt; [Your] Blood Presence healed [You] 0 Physical. (154 Overhealed)<br>
10:28:38&gt; [Dark Zealot] Melee hit [You] 247 Physical. <br>
10:28:38&gt; [Your] Necrosis hit [Dark Zealot] 770 Shadow. <br>
10:28:39&gt; [Your] Bloody Vengeance stacked [You] 2. <br>
10:28:39&gt; [You] killed [Dark Zealot]. <br>
10:28:39&gt; [Your] Death Strike hit [Dark Zealot] 5460 Physical. (1555 Overkill) (Critical)<br>
<b>10:28:39&gt; [Your] Death Strike healed [You] 247 Physical. (1451 Overhealed)</b><br>
10:28:39&gt; [Your] Blood Presence healed [You] 0 Physical. (219 Overhealed)<br>
10:28:39&gt; [Your] Grim Toll applied [You]. <br>
10:28:39&gt; [Your] Abominable Might applied [You]. <br>
10:28:39&gt; [Your] Butchery energized [You] 20 (Runic Power). <br>
<br>
So sometimes DS heals me for 7.5% of my hp eventhough there is no disease on the target.<br>
<br>
Edit: I found out Death Strike heals me EVERYTIME Death Strike is the killing blow.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Looking at your armory, you're Unholy. For Unholy, 4p t8 and 2p t9 have almost identical EP values (within 10 of each other, depending on the rest of your gear). As such, when you factor in the added stats, it's almost certainly an upgrade. So, yes, it is worth breaking 4p t8 for, but more for the increase in stats than anything else. The set bonuses (boni?) just cancel one another out. <br>

		<div id="post_message_1369530"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Leveling DK Spec and Presence<br>
<br>
DPSing while leveling is very different from DPSing while raiding.  Your targets typically don't survive through a single set of runes (fights will last on the order of 5 seconds unless AOEing), so things that are important to sustained DPS become irrelevent.  This, in addition to the fact that you typically have a chunk of downtime while you're finding the next mob to kill make burst damage king.  As such, once you have unholy presence, you're almost always better off in it than blood presence, especially when you take into account Improved Unholy Presence.  Napkin math time.<br>
<br>
Autoattack damage is equal in both presences.  Special abilities will hit for 13% less in UP, but you'll get to use up to 50% more of them due to the 1s GCD (if all your runes refreshed before you reached the next mob, 9 seconds out of combat.)  In the worst case of constant combat, you'd get 10% more attacks off due to IUP.  Ignoring sources of damage that are flat-out reduced in UP (diseases, D&amp;D, and (somewhat) death coil) and assuming a linear relationship between time spent out of combat and abilities you can use in combat, for the two presences to reach parity you'd need to spend roughly 0.7s ooc between fights.  In practice this time will be longer, but not by much: damage contribution from diseases is minimal, and you're more GCD constrained than RP constrained for death coil due to Butchery.<br>
<br>
You want to level unholy spec, largely due to the movement speed bonuses of On a Pale Horse and IUP.  Your spec shouldn't necessarily look anything like a raid spec; I used something like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091110145649/http://www.wowhead.com/?talent#jfVMzZMZf0hfxfbg0uxbhcqo:VLZVmM" target="_blank">Talent Calculator - World of Warcraft</a>.  A couple of notable omissions from this spec: Epidemic, Unholy Blight, Bone Shield.  Your targets will die too quickly for your diseases to wear off (or do much damage) or for UB to do its thing.  Since you're constantly going to be hit, BS is going to have minimal uptime and mitigate minimal damage.  Butchery provides a nice extra chunk of runic power, and Runic Power Mastery helps you avoid wasting runic power.  Only notable glyph is Death Grip, which is by far the best major glyph for leveling.<br>
<br>
It can also be handy to activate the dual-spec feature and to use a self-healing tank spec like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091110145649/http://www.wowhead.com/?talent#j0EMqc0IsfMbost0xZ0g:pG" target="_blank">Talent Calculator - World of Warcraft</a> for soloing group quests.  General idea is to use all frost and unholy runes for death strike for self healing, and to use pestilence to refresh your diseases when necessary.<br>
<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">When you have to tank massive incoming of ads (e.g. Thorim or the encounter in Halls of Stone) do you go only with Death and Decay (in reduced cooldown) and Blood Boil or do you risk it and try to always also apply diseases? I found that if the healing is imba applying diseases is optimal but if it's absolutely imperative to hold agro at all times by everything Blood Boil and Death and Decay only may be better though I am concerned damage(threat) is minimized. I wanted to hear your opinions.</div>

	</tbody></table>
</div>It's a mixture of both really. Don't forget the power of single disease Pest + BB too by the way. In an encounter such as Thorim, the saved GCD can make the difference.<br>
<br>
D&amp;D should always take priority of course, and you always have ERW to use if things get a little hairy.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Hi there, I have a few questions moderately specific to my own Death Knight- I'm sorry if these have been answered, I was unable to find them in this thread or the other threads.<br>

My alt DK:<br>

<br>
I have literally no Expertise.  Statweighs show that for my particular spec, Expertise is worth a good deal more than Strength, but I have been told I should gem for pure Strength regardless.<br>
<br>
What is the Expertise cap, and what should I be gemming for given my extremely low Expertise?</div>

	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>It's quite easy to search for the expertise cap within the forum, I'm somewhat surprised you didn't find it.<br>
<br>
However, as DW frost, expertise to the soft cap of 26 is a higher DPS increase than strength. As such, you should gem / enchant EXP until you reach that cap before for STR. The same goes for HIT.<br>

</div>I'm fairly sure he meant 5 or 6 from talents. As for gemming expertise, the general opinion is split. If you want your rotation to be smooth and eliminate all possible dps losses from a dodge, you cap Expertise (using gems if necessary).<br>
If you want to go for theoretical max dps, you gem pure strength and take expertise as you go from gear, gambling with your rotation being performed successfully.<br>

I'd have to disagree with you I'm afraid. As per the stat weights indicated <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090906001322/http://elitistjerks.com/f72/t64830-dw_builds_3_2_revenge_offhand/" target="_blank">here</a>, EXP until cap is a much higher EP than STR, and consequently a higher theoretical DPS increase. It's worth noting, however, that this is in a high level raid environment of course.<br>
<br>
Once the soft cap has been reached, EXP drops right down in EP, and of course STR exceeds it by a long shot.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1371673"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Before 3.2, Unholy Blight seemed far easier to understand -- if its up, its doing X dmg to any target w/i X yards. Since 3.2, I am unsure of the mechanics of the talent. Could someone map out the mechanics of UB for me please according to the following:<br>
<br>
(A) Does the 20% additional damage change based on the damage done by the DC that proc'd it? Or is it 20% of the damage DC in the tool tip?<br>
<br>
(B) Does the next DC reset the duration of the UB or does it extend it?<br>
<br>
(C) If all it does is reset the duration, is it worth choosing a secondary (and sometimes a third if available) to DC to maximize UB damage?<br>
<br>
(D) Assuming (A) is the specific DC and (C) will boost dps, is it worth insuring a DC crits before moving on to the next target?<br>
<br>
(E) Is UB such a small % of overall dps now that the above is more or less irrelevant?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

4. Aside from gemming for hit, is it ever worth gemming for anything other than +stam and to meet the meta gem?<br>
<br>

I'd have to disagree with you I'm afraid. As per the stat weights indicated <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090906001322/http://elitistjerks.com/f72/t64830-dw_builds_3_2_revenge_offhand/" target="_blank">here</a>, EXP until cap is a much higher EP than STR, and consequently a higher theoretical DPS increase. It's worth noting, however, that this is in a high level raid environment of course.<br>
<br>
Once the soft cap has been reached, EXP drops right down in EP, and of course STR exceeds it by a long shot.</div>

</div>An individual a few posts back nailed it on the head.  Simulators calculate out long hours of combat, ie simulated maximum sustained DPS, where expertise has shown to be the best, as it increases the minimum value of your DPS, but not your maximum (as you mentioned, there is a cap to when expertise becomes essentially worthless).  Strength, on the other hand, increases the theoretical maximum dps one can put out in the event he can pull a lucky string of no misses / dodges in a fight (while not being hit / exp capped).<br>
<br>
EP values aren't everything, you have to use your head on some of the stuff here, the EPs are calculated over the course of a 100+ hours (generally around 1,000) - not your average 3-4 minute burst encounter like we currently have in game.  As for frmorrison, he was stating 5/6 expertise from all properly spec'd dks, I personally raid with him and know that he wouldn't have said something to the effect of 5-6 expertise is all you need, he simply left out 'spec' in his post.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Game designers have managed to make effective HP the king in tanking lately and it will need quite a critical need that can not be overcome otherwise to sacrifice it. <br>
<br>
i.e. I'd only go to something other that stamina after crit cap if: <br>
a) DPSes constantly steal agro, requiring threat through hit, expertise or remotely, strength <br>
b) Where tanking is aimed (in a rare scenario) at multiple targets where avoidance is more useful or in another rare scenario a boss is so rapidly attacking with low dmg hits that avoidance becomes superior, <br>

</div>Fixing that set bonus will require either a hotfix or the 3.2.2 patch (assuming the devs fixed it, no idea).  I know the Hunter and Ret bonus was broken and has been fixed on the PTR.<br>

		<div id="post_message_1380450"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->If you take t9 BiS set pieces you either off set chest or helm - considering more builds prefer to off set the helm I used Shoulders, Chest, Gloves and Legs for calcs.  For the purpose of this 'theorycraft' we will consider t8 4pc and t9 2pc equal (even though t9 2pc beats t8 4pc for every spec), so we are comparing dropping t8 2pc for t9 4pc without the set bonus (ie pure itemization).<br>
<br>
Going from t8 to t9 nets the following: <br>
<br>
78 Sta<br>
86 Str<br>
406 Armor<br>
82 Armor Pen<br>
109 Crit<br>
21 Hit<br>
-55 Expertise<br>
-40 Haste<br>
<br>
The t8 2p is worth ~120 ap to UH, ~90 ap to DW Frost, and ~70 ap to Blood, so for t9 to out perform t8 2p without calculating the t9 4p you would have to beat...<br>
<br>
Unholy - 287 ap<br>
Frost - 326 ap<br>
Blood - 300 ap<br>
<br>
Now, the bonuses above total...<br>
Unholy - 633.38 (gain of 346.38)<br>
Frost - 697.24 (gain of 371.24)<br>
Blood - 749.09 (gain of 449.09)<br>
<br>
So, yes, regardless of the set bonus functioning correctly at the current time the t9 4pc ilvl 245 set (shoulder / chest / gloves / legs) are dominant over t8.  Once they fix the bonus (assuming it isn't intended) the values will go up even more.  As for the weights used I used the 3/13/55 2h UH, my personal 3/51/17 frost weights through multiple 1,000 hour sims in the simulator, and an updated version of my personal blood stat weights (factoring in fixed arm pen value) as the values.  I can post those weights if you would like to do your own testing (different off pieces, like plated leggings of ruination, etc.).<br>
<br>
The end result is, however, that t9 is clearly dominant despite the 4pc being broken, so it is very much so worth the investment.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1380460"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->You would need to do your own math then.  The stat weights are in Zerack's Gear Optimizer program, you can go to Wowhead to compare the two sets stats and see if they are still a bonus for you on an individual level (which pieces you intend to upgrade, what 239 loot you may have that is better than the 232 loot, etc).<br>
<br>
You simply take the t8 2pc bonus, and then add whatever stats the t8 has over the 232 t9 (should just be expertise and haste), and then use that as your base value that the other set needs to exceed to be an upgrade.  Then you take the bonus t9 provides over t8 and muliply those by the specific values listed in the optimizer and subtract the initial value you achieved from the t8 2pc and t8 raw bonus to see the effective attack power you receive from the upgrade (and without 239 loot it should be a very solid upgrade).<br>
<br>
edit: Also - I forgot to mention any socket differences between the two sets and didn't factor having them socketed (they both have 6 sockets - t8 has 1 red, 1 yellow, 4 blues and t9 has 3 red, 2 yellow, 1 blue - in the end from a raw itemization format on sockets the t9 should be a bonus anyways, especially considering the 4pc mentioned above all have str socket bonuses on t9).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1381158"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->While we're on the topic of 4 pc, is anyone familiar with a weight for the four piece bonus for the 0/17/54 dual weild DC spam build?

Despite the increase in stats, I have to wonder if it's worth losing the 2 pc t8 (since dc is my main attack), especially if my diseases are just going to clip so much. Unfortunately we don't have set bonus numbers in the dw thread op for this spec. :x<br>

I guess this question could be answered by Asphyxia above if it's true that his conversion of the 2pc t8 bonus to AP for unholy holds true for a build which spams DC mich more than your average UH 2H build.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Simply put, after the SotVH frost strike damage reduction (which was the bulk of 2h frost damage) 2H frost is no longer competitive or viable. EJ (as a whole) does not care for aesthetics nor what's necessarily enjoyable. Instead it is focused on what benefits the raid, which is essentially not 2h frost atm.<br>

</div>The Raised Ally can be Battle Rezed.  Not sure if you can be re-Raised Ally if you die, I suspect not since the corpse was "used up".<br>

For DK tanking, let's say 5000 AP raid buffed (I think mine is around there), would the +20 hit or the +2% threat enchant yield more overall threat increase?  (Assuming below melee hit cap).<br>

And if we want to satisfy a red gem socket, would 10 strength or 10 expertise be better for threat after 26 expertise/dodge cap is reached?<br>

</div>2% is the best threat enchant (even with 0 hit and 0 expertise) and you get 10 parry rating as well.<br>
<br>
The best threat stat is expertise (pre 26 cap), then strength, then slightly below strength is expertise post 26 cap.  Note expertise will reduce parry haste (more bosses have it on than turned off), which reduces damage taken somewhat.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Could it just be my terribly low ArP, and in this case, should I just switch over to Unholy-SS build now instead of picking up more ArP-stat gear (in one way, I'm lucky?)?

				<div style="font-style:italic">1) Question about Horn of Winter: Sometimes when I put it up, it doesn't show up with all the other raid buffs - this is usually in the heat of battle (say perhaps halfway into a boss encounter).  I don't see it and I was told once that another member did not see it either...so is there a bug/glitch (you get the stat increase but not the actual buff icon), or is there just something else (a totem?) that can overwrite Horn Of Winter?  I know I use it for the RP generation since I am Unholy but I was just wondering...maybe some others have noticed that from time to time as well.</div>

</div>If a shaman puts out SoE totem (any shaman, doesn't matter if specced into Improved SoE), HoW won't show up, since the totem is potentially stronger. You still get the RP, though. Depending on the fight (e.g. fights, where melee are not always within range of elemental / restoration shaman's totems) it may be advisable to tell those shamans to use a different totem and let you supply the buff. In case of an enhancement shaman, the shaman should supply the buff, since it is stronger and his totems are usually always within range for the melee.<br>
In any event you always get the RP, though.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

@Lu Bu: <br>
They don't run off aggroing new packs if that's what you mean. If you're currently fighting a pack and the mob you were attacking dies, they will go after some other mob in the same pack though. <br>
Re: healing I checked a recent combatlog and under Healing Recieved for my bloodworms it says: Glyph of Holy Light  70.7%, Judgement of Light 22.8%, Protection of Ancient Kings 6.4%, Circle of Healing 0.0%. <br>
Checking a recent singletarget parse shows them doing ~100dps over 6 minutes to Algalon. So yes, they are a dps increase, but they do eat aoe heals.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Does Obliterate REALLY wipe out the diseases on a target when specced for Unholy DPS.  Everytime I use it I still see my diseases up on my target's debuff list as reported by my addon's, but I don't see them on my target's debuff list above the target's frame (It can be hard to find these guys though b/c usually I'm only worried about it when I'm raiding).<br>

		<div id="post_message_1396845"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Hi all,<br>
<br>
Hopefully this is not a stupid question.<br>
<br>
My DK recently dinged 80. I notice in the consolidated blood guide that the primary stat for DK is strength. Like other classes we have a hit cap of 263 and the guide instructs to gain hit from equipment and not to gem for it.<br>
<br>
The problem I have is finding DK kit with hit on it, for example if you take a glance at my character, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091214063946/http://eu.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Twilight%27s+Hammer&amp;n=Sammantha" target="_blank">Sammantha</a>, you will see that very little of it has hit. I am now approaching the point where I have accumulated enough emblems of conquest to start purchasing the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091214063946/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=46111" target="_blank">Conquerer's Darkruned Battleplate</a> and even this doesn't have hit.<br>
<br>
Yesterday I ran OS25 and was managing to DPS around 4.5k at 99 hit. I have now gemmed to hit gems to test. My hit has increased, but not capped, yet I have not noticed a significant increase in DPS.<br>
<br>
Finally the question! Should I ignore hit and return to strength gems or go all out and purchase epics and get to hit cap come hell or high water?<br>
<br>
Thanks.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>That is totally accounted for. As a matter of fact that is the whole thing that gives hit rating its value. If you miss a plague strike you dont discard that, you just redo the attack and drop the attack with the least DPGCD (Dmg per GCD), which in most cases is RP dump. <br>
<br>
That doesn't take away that the decreasing that chance by 1 rating is worse dps (even counting the rotation messing up), than adding 1 strength which increases all your abilities.<br>
<br>
What does need a footnote in my opinion however, is that these numbers are generated with simulators which in most cases react in the ideal way to something like a miss. A person might not react the same way.<br>
Imagine a busy fight with a lot of stuff going on, someone hits plague strike which misses, but he doesnt notice until he used icy touch and obliterate because of dodging fires. In this case he not only lost a GCD worth of dps (which the simulator accounts for) but also a multiplier on that obliterate (the sim didnt make that slip-up). This is not the same as panic by the way, I see panic as a lack of skill or confidence.<br>
<br>
Most simulators run under ideal circumstances (granted you can add latency, but discicion wise they always chose the best option); and they should to be able to provide the best data. However if transfer that data to the real thing you often notice that it doesn't fully transfer equally. In a non-ideal situation expertise and hitrating will gain ground on strength, which is good enough of a reason for a lot of people to aim for the spell hit cap and expertise cap, even though those stats are strictly seen inferior to stacking more strength.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Parry gib is a non-issue on beasts as Gormok doesn't gain hasted attacks from parrying.<br>
In general parry gib isn't as much of an issue as people make believe, especially not for a DK that tanks with a slow 2H. <br>
<br>
The biggest reason he does survive when you guys don't is most likely because he has more cushioning with his large healthpool.<br>
Your best bet is to stack up on stamina gear, as it is the only thing that "mitigates" the bleed damage.<br>
<br>
Expertise is still a good stat, but moreso to boost your TPS. Especially on timer sensitive fights like beasts (get gormok down before the worms come), a string of parries/dodges is annoying.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1399647"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Looking for some simple advice/direction to reduce the number of pages I need to read/re-read.  I took a break from WoW around April or May and decided to play again last week.  When I left I was geared in full 7.5 armor with a few Ulduar pieces and Betrayer.  I was 2-handed frost specced and am sad to hear that is no longer a competitive option (I was enjoying my Sigil of the Vengeful Heart frost strikes).  Being quite rusty I am looking for a competitive spec with the most forgiving of rotations - forgiving in skill and in lag issues (I'm getting around 200-250ms listed).<br>
<br>
I could most easily get back into frost, but if the results are just going to be disappointing I'd prefer not to.  I tried the 2-handed Blood (51/0/20) build, but found that I was having serious issues not letting the diseases drop unless I had 2 points in epidemic.  Even then I ran into issues as my rustiness would cause me to flub a rotation and have a hard time getting back into the swing.  I am open to dual wielding (I always liked frost) but my weapon choices there would be quite limited.  What do you think would be my best option for getting back into the feel of playing my DK?  That way I can focus my reading on the thread of the chosen build.  If dual wielding of some form is the answer, what relatively easyily obtained weapons should I go for?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>That's incorrect. GoD doesn't reapply the diseases, it merely refreshes the timer. That means that whatever buffs you had when you applied the diseases stick until the disease falls off.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
First off: I run an Unholy Dps build, PS is better to start with because of the Rage of Rivendare. But, what about for closing the gap between you and the mob or boss? I've noticed I can use Icy Touch at it's peak range, and by the time I get to the boss, the GCD is down and I can plague strike. Is being 1.5seconds ahead of the game worth the 10% damage loss from that one move?<br>
<br>
The other one is more of tanking in general:<br>
<br>
Marking on the run is a royal pain, is there a macro that I can use to mark? Like I'm looking at one of the bosses/mob and can skull him, hit tab and get a quick x on him?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

recently switched from DW Frost dps to 2H Blood (51/0/20) &amp; 2H Unholy (17/0/54). Tested both specs both on dummies &amp; raid environment (ToC25,ToGC25, 6k+ ap raidbuffed) and I found that 2H Unholy leaves me with 2.5-5.5k dps loss comparing to 2H Blood (5k dps with a lot of target switching up to 11k dps while AEing).</div>

</div>Are you including the Ghoul/Garg's damage?  Normally Ghoul is around ~12% and Garg is around 3%.  Assuming you did add it (note World of Logs can do each separate, but adds all three in the overall damage), unless your raid needed the sp buff (Moonkin and Lock have it), use some other spec instead.  You are lucky that you have three viable dps specs!<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>You can keybind the marks. I personally have skull set to both the numpad1 and one of the thumb buttons on my mouse. Generally speaking if i am tanking i just skull a mob, once it reaches ~10% i change targets and skull my new target. I do however have X and "moon" bound to numpad2 and 3 respectively, so if i want to pause for 1 sec i can tab through and make 3 targets quickly. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
My question, and a very noobish one at that, apologies. I'm in the process of switching to a DK for my "dps main", and trying to learn "everything"... I've spent some time googling and searching EJ, but can't find a yes or no to "does haste lower the CD on runes"?? Basically i'm tinkering around in rawr, and i pushed theoritical DPS up alot tinkering with rotations, but i'm not sure if rawr is properly enforcing game mechanics.<br>
<br>
All the reading i've done leads me to believe that nothing will affect the CD on runes (other than abilites that reset them) but i'd just like to get a solid yes or no.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>It does not. Apart from the combination of playing in UP and having skilled it in deep Unholy (lowers the CD by 1 sec) you were right to conclude, that there is nothing that affects the Rune CD. It would be really odd, if haste lowered the CD on your runes, since haste <b>never</b> affects cooldowns, except for the GCD of all abilities. Runes limit our set of abilities we are allowed to use over a certain period of time. It's intended that way and therefor has to remain at this set amount.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>DK tanks do not need to reach the Exp soft cap (26), although it is a nice thing to reach, however the def cap (-5.6% crit removal) or 540 Def on your character sheet is very important.  Once you have a decent stamina and avoidance levels, then get expertise to soft cap and then hit (expertise is better because most DK attacks are melee, although there are a few spells as well).<br>
<br>
My goal with tank gearing is pickup the best tank drops I can and gem for stamina/avoidance.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>You would need to make eight different macros. You could, however, put several icons in one macro and have each icon be assigned on a different modifier (ctrl, alt, ...). It depends very much on what you want to do. If you only want to assign an icon to your current target it's probably best to just use the standard key bindings. If you want to do more (like the aforementioned focussing of that target) you'd need a macro.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I don't understand how you can be producing such low threat numbers. The only fight that DPS are even remotely close to me on threat is twins and that's largely because they significantly outgear my tank set. Furthermore, if you're looking to improve your threat, you should focus on becoming hit-capped way before becoming exp. capped.

</div>To be honest, it's not that my threat is bad as such, but rather that I get really unlucky at times. Maybe my dps is just really not used to checking their threat, I'm not sure. It's usually a lock or hunter, and then I pretty much only mean getting dodged or parried. So that's why i tend to value expertise quite a bit, as a bonus of course. I can really tell the difference between my current 31 and say 22 (my previous value before helm upgrade). We downed heroic Anub tonight for the first time so it was certainly no problem then <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100116162952im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":)" class="inlineimg"><br>

</div>I would agree.  15 sta isn't going to save you and having another *oh crap* cooldown is always helpful.  <br>

I have been swapping out to the two pure STA trinkets only for Gormok on Heroic TOC.  Our healers were unable to keep me alive if I didn't use pure STA trinkets for that fight because of the 40% dmg increase and the insane impale dmg.<br>

How does the 101hp per 5sec work in the trinket off Onyxia's head?<br>
Does it get any buffs from Vampiric Blood for example? (35% extra healing, other similar effects)<br>

</div>The disease timers are reset. Generally you can distinguish between "refresh disease", "(re-)apply disease", "spread disease" on the one hand (this always implies a tick reset) and "refresh disease <b>duration</b>" on the other hand (this always implies, that the tick is not being reset).<br>

</div>I'm not absolutely positive on this, as I just got 4T9 today and haven't spent much time on observing this, yet. However, I just tested it on some elite Jormungar. Fact is, they do not proc always simultaneously if you analyze the combat log. However, I had similar experiences during the raid today (yay @107k DPS at Onyxia whelps) and I suspect that Wandering Plague procs off critical disease strikes are displayed in the floating combat text as crits themselves (even though they technically aren't). However, this is just guessing, since I disconnected at Onyxia shortly afterwards.<br>
<br>
[e] Just realized that you are Blood specced, so it cannot be WP. However, they definitely don't always crit simultaneously on all targets. But it could just very well be, that if you have 30 targets (say, at Onyxia) and you have a 33% crit chance on diseases, you have an expectation of 10 simultaneous crits. It could just be, that those crits fill the screen to such a degree, that you don't realize the non-crits.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>For Unholy, weapon speed doesn't matter as much as for Blood and other Plate dps, since a lot of damage comes from the Ghoul, Death Coil, and diseases which are unaffected by weapon speed.  3.3 may change that though.<br>
<br>
Assuming you had your 7% hit (with a space goat) elsewhere, the Shadowstrike may be better.  Rawr in this case can run that calculation.   Dwarf and Humans get expertise from Maces, so that is something to look at as well.<br>

</div>That depends on 2H or DW.<br>
For 2H, 263 and get a draenei in the group.<br>
For DW, as much as you can without compromising on your dps and other things.<br>
However, if you're a tank, you may not need to get 263 unless you're having a lot of threat problems due to the missing of spells.<br>

</div>If you have problems with single target TPS, you should also look at your rotation as that may be the problem.<br>
Also, if you're prioritising TPS, you should still stick with the Titansteel Destroyer as that would give you slightly more threat.

		<div id="post_message_1420499"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I've got a DK Tank I use for casual 10-mans and 5-man content. I'm tanking in 2H-frost (mostly because we AoE a lot of the content and I find HB comforting). I'm hovering around 556Def (with SG runeforge) and 31k HP. I use a single-disease build with glyph of HB, OB and FS.<br>
<br>
I've got three questions: First, I'm Defcapped but I understand Diminishing Returns don't apply before 565 (due to SG not counting for cap). Should I be aiming for 565 Def, or should I be aiming for (whatever above 540) and aim my gear in the direction of Stamina/Dodge?<br>
<br>
Second, how useful in TPS terms is the 10% Runestrike damage bonus on Tier gear? I can't accurately determine what percentage of my TPS Runestrike represents because there's always a large amount of adds diluting my damage-recording addon data. The only thing I've noticed, is RS represents circa 10.5% of my Damage Done, fractionally less than OB (~11%), which is also single target. Is it normal to have RS damage comparable to OB damage (assuming no RS glyph, and wearing OB glyph)? I'm not estimating the set bonus is all that given my content. Am I wrong?<br>

Lastly, I've got both Brewfest Stam trinkets, as well as The Black Heart. I'm assuming the Heart's proc is worth more than the 44 Stam difference, am I right or am I better off wearing both Stambuckets?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>1 - You aim for 540, if you are looking for gear with high avoidance or hit / exp and that pushes you above that, so be it, but you only really aim for 540, otherwise you are 'wasting' itemization points that could be spent on armor, dodge, parry, hit, exp, strength, etc.  That doesn't mean that defense after 540 is worthless by any means, just that you can stop stacking it and aim for other stats.<br>
<br>
2 - Runestrike is your top TPS skill, by a substantial amount.  10% increased TPS is a very big deal and you should look into it.  The skill is designed to generate a large amount of threat percentage in relation to its damage, so despite it doing slightly less damage than Obliterate, it is miles ahead of Obliterate in terms of threat.<br>
<br>
3 - Blackheart's proc is better than the Brewfest trinkets.<br>
<br>
Also, using a single disease is, for the most part, fine, but you didn't mention the usage of BS above in your priority list, you are using Blood Strike, correct?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Glyph of RS is superior to Glyph of Obliterate if you are using RS correctly (ie - make a macro for it on every ability you have essentially and only using rp dumps like Frost Strike / Death Coil if your RP is at 60+).  That is for TPS only, for DPS the reverse is true.  Obliterate does a higher percentage of damage and 20% raw bonus is a higher damage bonus than 10% crit is on rune strike, so Glyph of OB will result in higher DPS while Glyph of RS will result in higher TPS.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1422402"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->And on the subject of frost tanking, is a DW tanking scenario viable with a one-disease Glyph of HB spec? Given that I'm slightly low on gear, the relative merrit of DW tanking weapons versus a 2H DPS weapon makes the prospect quite attractive, but I fear the numbers perhaps won't work out.<br>
<br>
I'm also slightly apprehensive of a DW spec which runs with no Icy Talons. I can't always have another buffer provide me with the haste buff, and I'd rather not skip my own talents to gain it. Will a DW tank spec without the haste compare favourably?<br>
<br>
Also, are sub-234 raid bosses likely to parry-haste? I'm aware only two in ToC do parry-haste but don't know much else.<br>

		<div id="post_message_1423340"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Its seems such a simple thing yet I can’t find the answer in black and white anywhere. <br>
How do auto attacks work?<br>
<br>
Not so much how do they hit as what determines when and how often they swing? <br>
<br>
Are they independent from strikes and spells (since except for AOTD all my spells are instant cast)?<br>
<br>
Does haste and presence affect them? <br>
<br>
I played around on the dummy a bit and got the impression melee just goes at a set rate independent of strikes etc and that unholy presence does increase the number of swing. Implying that haste would also increase white hits (in blood anyways).<br>
<br>
Is this correct?<br>
<br>
Another thing I am curious about and lack the knowledge of statistics and hard core math to figure on my own, after melee hit cap for dual wield, 5%, does additional hit increase white damage as a linier function? Or is it a curve of some sort?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
I hope this is not a stupid question, I've searched every thread I could think of to search.<br>
<br>
I have a DW DK, 0/53/18. I have 4 piece T7. I have enough badges to purchase the T9 shoulders. <br>
<br>
Rawr evaluated these shoulders as only a 6 unbuffed DPS upgrade, despite the new shoulders having almost 60 more attack power, more hit, crit, etc. I tried the correct color gem to make sure it was not breaking my meta, and so on.<br>
<br>
I assumed the four piece bonus was not that great, but maybe the 4t7 is a lot better than I originally thought. I know I do throw a lot of Frost Strikes out, but since I'm usually capped on RP until I go to dump, I couldn't imagine it making that big of a difference.<br>

</div>I am aware that haste reduces swing time. Does it also reduce the GCD (provided your not in unholy presence) thus getting an additive effect. (faster swings more often).<br>
<br>
How does melee attack frequency work? Is it independent from the global cool down? Is it independent from any strikes and/or spells cast? Does it sit there adding up damage at a pretty set rate despite anything else you might be doing? Or does other activity slow or interrupt white damage? <br>
<br>
As for hit, I was unclear, I forgot to mention with respect to dual wielding where the strike hit cap is 5%. The dw melee hit cap being 24%. Does +hit over 5% add more damage in a liner function or with diminishing returns? <br>
<br>

For example, Unholy specs that favor DC spam will get a good deal out of haste, whereas a Frost build that uses only one 'spell' every 20 seconds (either Icy touch or Pestilence, depending on IIT or GoD) get practically nothing.

</div>You seem to be confusing linearity. Hit past 8% (not 5%, as I corrected you already) will not affect special melee attacks. Hit past 18% will not affect Spell attacks. Hit past 24% will not affect anything at all.<br>
<br>
It's inaccurate to call it Linear to begin with. Each % of hit increase gives you less and less, relatively, for example a 50% hit increasing to 51% hit is a relative 2% increase, while a 99% going to 100% is just a relative 1.01% increase. The rate of decay, however, is totally linear.<br>
<br>
There is no curves involved, and at no point is there a drop-off, an inflection point, or any irregularity related to maths.<br>
<br>
Strictly, the only critical points are 8%, 18% and 24%, and then only because Hit stops affecting some part of your DPS cycle. Those are not related to the rate-of-decay of Hit rating's benefit however.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>In fact, the critical points are 8% melee, 17% spell and 27% melee.<br>
<br>
At 8% (melee hit) 2H and special melee hit is capped. For DW with Nerves of Cold Steel this point is at 5%.<br>
At 17% (spell hit) spell hit is capped. With Improved Faerie Fire / Misery (3%) and Virulence (3%) this point is at 11%. Notice, though, that spell hit scales faster than melee hit, so 11% spell hit equals about 9% melee hit.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">You seem to be confusing linearity. Hit past 8% (not 5%, as I corrected you already) will not affect special melee attacks. Hit past 18% will not affect Spell attacks. Hit past 24% will not affect anything at all.<br>
<br>
It's inaccurate to call it Linear to begin with. Each % of hit increase gives you less and less, relatively, for example a 50% hit increasing to 51% hit is a relative 2% increase, while a 99% going to 100% is just a relative 1.01% increase. The rate of decay, however, is totally linear.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>Actually, you're the one confused on what linear means. Hit does provide a (very nearly) piecewise-linear--or more precisely, affine--increase to dps.  That is to say, for a dual-wielder, increasing hit by 1% gives you the same white damage increase whether you're at 15% or 20% hit.  There are some second-order effects from procs such as KM, FC, and some trinkets, that change this slightly, but the overall effect is pretty negligible.<br>
<br>
While it's true that each point is a smaller relative increase in damage, that is true of any linear function.  Crit, haste, and AP all scale in the same way--the damage increase is linear if you fix the rest of your stats (again ignoring some small second-order effects), which means the relative gain is smaller at higher values.  If there were a stat whose relative dps gain increased linearly, then the stat would provide exponential growth to your damage.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1429044"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Well, i was checking to see when kings would be better for dk's then might (assuming there is only one pally and nobody has drums for kings)<br>

So i did some checking on a training dummy with a pally next to me casting kings when i asked. and it seemed kings scaled very well if you have a lot of str buff's eg, DMC greatness, SoV (200str) and other said bonuses.<br>
<br>
Horn of winter scales and so does all other dk's proc's and buffs, but im wondering how far will i need to push str, to see a constant benifit, as i went from about 2000 str without kings, to 2240 with kings (buffs that stay up constantly) that is a pretty large increase, but i was hoping someone could help me out here.<br>
<br>
P.s My final str buff was at 2458 exact, without kings, and with kings it was just under 3000 str with kings (with all item/enchant proc's going off for both value's)<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1429136"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->So i have been PUGing every piece of my gear since i quit raiding, anyways im at a Xroad in my gear choice.<br>
<br>
I have 50 triumph emblems and i can either:<br>
<br>
A. Buy a third piece of T9 (232 variety). Most likely the helm, as i have the gloves (245) and shoulders (232) already. This would replace T8 helm.<br>
<br>
OR<br>
<br>
B. Purchase the Mark of Supremacy trinket (128 passive hit and 1024 AP proc for 20 secs) This would replace MoT.<br>
<br>
<br>
Ok at first glance its obvious right, get the T9 and work my way up to the 4 piece....but here is where im stuck.<br>
<br>
If if get the Trinket and respec out of Virulence that would put me exactly at the spell hit cap (with Spriest or Boomkin). Along with giving me great flexibility for future gearing with the hit.<br>
<br>
Second point:<br>
I am DW frost, and im thinking by the time i get my 4 piece finally (remember i PUG all my triumph badges, takes a bit for me to get 50 triumphs) 3.3 might be almost out, and we all know about the nerf to 4 piece, so that makes it much less attractive to me, ESPECIALLY being the the disease that they are keeping to crit is blood plague...it would be a no-brainer for me if it was frost fever.<br>
<br>
IF you wanna check my character out that would be great, this guy im posting on is my old old lock, you can armory Archaeus on Turalyon.<br>
<br>
ATM im slightly leaning toward the trinket, but if you can talk me into the Tier....go for it.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Wow cannot believe i forgot about it being a preREQ in Unholy...for some reason i was thinking it was in the second tier of talents.....did it used to be? /shrug<br>
<br>
<br>
And yes i did break down and grab the 232 helmet.<br>
<br>
NOW here is my other predicament!<br>
<br>
To achieve my 4 piece bonus i either have to replace my legs or my chest, my chest is T8 with the expertise, my legs are a 245 item that i PUG'd......with haste and crit.<br>
<br>
Am i crazy for planning on downgrading my legs (245 with haste) for the T9 (232, mind you better itemized with ArP) rather than upgrading a 226&gt;232? <br>
<br>
I just have no other gear for expertise and that chest keeps me right at the soft cap, replacing that i would lose 6 expertise, gain some haste (boo). It makes all the sense in the world to replace the 245 with a 232 to get my 4 piece T9.....yet it also does not : (   <br>
<br>
I of course could gem or enchant back up to the expertise cap, but i also gain a good amount of ArP from the 232 T9 legs, just losing haste, a small bit of crit, and about ....14 STR i believe.<br>
<br>
So, am i nuts for contemplating this?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
Also keep in mind that each piece of gear isn't the greatest (or worst) thing in the world, and while maximizing your DPS is always a good thing, it takes several steps to get there.  Don't waste your time freaking out about the little stuff at the very least until you have the biggest issues taken care of.<br>
<br>
<br>
Alundra, base might is 550 AP, upped to 687.5 with talents.  Kings will overtake might when the total stat weight bonus becomes greater than those numbers.  Looking at the equivalency points and such, kings will guarantee at least 550 AP equivalent at 2200 strength (this is for strength-&gt;AP only, and is an overestimation, hence why it's a guarantee.  The actual value could be as low as 1800ish.  From what you say about your gear, ask for Kings first since it'll be a bigger buff for you.)<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Spell hit does not work like melee hit.  You spell miss at level 80:<br>
80: 96%<br>
81: 95%<br>
82: 94%<br>
83: 83%<br>
<br>
So for PvP you need 4% spell hit (note Unholy gets 3% spell hit for free and some classes have spell miss talents/racials).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
Would subspeccing Unholy for [Corpse Explosion] better utilize RP in AoE situations (i.e. for AoE threat/multitarget aggro) vs. Blood subspec with Frost Strikes as an RP dump? <br>
<br>
Would the loss of 5/5 [Bladed Armor] and/or 2/2 [Two-Hand Weapon Spec] be crippling for overall threat or single-target threat, vs. 3% Strength (from [Ravenous Dead]) and autoattack bonus from [Necrosis] (assuming you could go 3/5).<br>
<br>
If Frost tank subspec Unholy has been discussed, found lacking, and dismissed before, why? Is there a thread on this forum or elsewhere detailing it? (My searches yielded no results)<br>
<br>
Thank you in advance.<br>
<br>
<br>
[edit]<br>
<br>
After a bit more thought, I became aware of the embarrassingly obvious fact that 4/5 [Bladed Armor] is still possible with the above talent distribution. With this in mind, would 4/5 [Bladed Armor] + 3% Strength from [Ravenous Dead] be an acceptable tradoff for 5/5 BA and 2/2 2h Weapon Spec as far as threat is concerned (single-target and overall)?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Does it matter if I refresh them with say 0.1sec left or 2.9sec left?<br>
Is Pestilence pushing the timer to 21sec or to 18sec+timeLeft? <br>

I tried using Pestilence 6 times in a row (via Death Runes) and I did get damage ticks.<br>

		<div id="post_message_1436144"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Normally I'd only advise a single-disease rotation in the case of Glyph of Howling Blast. The relative merit is the trade-off:<br>
<br>
is [ 1xIT + 1xPS + (the increased damage to OB and BS in 2 rotations) ] greater than [one more OB in the same 2 rotations, but all OB/BS at lower damage]<br>
<br>
Remember, while an average non-crit IT+PS is comparable though lower damage to 1xOB, OB has a much higher crit rate and benefits from GoG. And never eats up a KM proc, unlike IT.<br>
<br>
I've not seen benefit, from a tanking perspective, to adding a second disease as Frost. Frost seems more comfortably tuned towards using runes two at a time (appart from BS, but that's only because you have no other option) and so Glyph of Disease isn't really an optimal choice, like it is for Blood tanking.<br>
<br>
Personally I swear by GoHB and single-disease Frost spec. Particularly when dual-weilding, Rime is almost always enough to keep FF up even with 0/2 Epidemic. Admittedly, I've not always felt totally comfortable with 2h Frost threat generation, but as DW it seems much improved.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>If you have some gold to spend, I'd look for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100120104314/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=48663" target="_blank">Tankard of Terror</a> in the auction house. A lot of them dropped during Brewfest, and you can still often find them for affordable prices. Other than that your best best is trying to get in some heroic ToC groups for <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100120104314/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=47508" target="_blank">Aledar's Battlestar</a>. You may have difficulties finding a group that will take you in starter 80s gear though.<br>
<br>
For some easier weapons you have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100120104314/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=49128" target="_blank">The Horseman's Baleful Blade</a> for as long as Hallow's end continues. The droprate is very low, but you can also make use of the melee dps ring dropping from the horseman.

In general, you want to avoid Mark of Blood because it is hard to use properly.  Rune Tap can be used when you get low if you are quick about using it.  Note you may just cause the healer to overheal even if you heal yourself with Rune Tap.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1438593"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Hi,<br>
<br>
I just returned after roughly a year of boring real life stuff like a wedding and a baby boy - just to find out the DW HB KA DK I knew no longer exists. I must admit I have a hard time re-gaining the joy I had back then to develop this little DPS monster for our raid. Never did Ulduar or the even newer content, so I am still stuck with the Nax + Malygos equipment, and I like the DW style. So I am trying to get things worked out between these two skill sets for deep frost. Question now is: Is it worth to drop Butchery + Bladed Armor + Merciless Combat in favor of Ravenous Dead + Necrosis + Blood Caked Blade (1/3)? BCB used to be an important talent for DW ... does anybody see anything else in Frost that could be dropped for the remaining 2 pts? Shoot me.<br>

</div>For Blood you gain 3% stamina versus Frost with 3% less melee hits.  The advantage of Frost is snap AoE threat (Blood takes some time to get AoE threat with Pest then Blood Boil), so if you don't need that spec Blood now.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
Does the gargoyle benefit from the troll racial Berserking? I know they it's supposed to scale with haste, but seeing how it is affected by bloodlust/heroism this question popped to my mind. I am new to trolls and their racials myself, hooray for race change.<br>
<br>
EDIT: Nevermind! I tested it out myself and in case someone was wondering the same question, yes, it does seem to affect the gargoyle. When I popped berserking right before gargoyle, it did a few extra strikes during it's duration.<br>
<br>
No berserking = 11 gargoyle strikes<br>

How much hit is needed for "Dark Command" to not miss? In this thread there have been posts stating that this taunt is a spell and therefore uses the spell hit cap or that it is a "melee attack" and uses the melee hit cap. What is true?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Dark Command is not classified as a spell, and as such it only requires 8% to hit. The glyph is in place so extremely low-geared tanks don't have a horrific time with it. Past levelling tanking it's practically useless, as you can expect to have at least 5% hit.<br>
<br>
As a tank you should be at or near the 8% hit mark; in the extremely rare occasion it doesn't work, you can always try DG, which contains a taunt even if the target does not get "pulled" or comes up with "immune".<br>
<br>
Runestrike can be more than 15% of your DPS, which means it's significantly more of your TPS. GoRS is a very serious investment in TPS while GoDC is a glyph that prevents something that shouldn't happen at all.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Confirmation?  My understanding (moreso from a paladin perspective) is that it's a spell.  Keeping in mind that there is a 3% spellhit buff floating around, and 8% melee hit should give around 10% spell hit.  Some paladins, even near the melee hit cap, still use their version of the taunt glyph to guarantee it goes off;  unlike DPS DKs, tank DKs don't usually have the spare points to grab virulence to make capping spells easy.<br>
<br>
That being said, it'd be extremely rare to see a taunt resist without GoDC and high hit anyway, not to mention you have a backup taunt - DG - to use if it does resist.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1440920"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->What is the best DPS build for an undergeared dual-wield DK?<br>
<br>
I'm currently in a hybdrid pvp/pve spec, but switching to separate specs for pvp/pve, and I want advice on a PvE spec.  Currently, most of my top gear is pvp gear, because this is a fresh 80 - farming heroics atm.    I'm using DW Tankards of Terror - best BoE weapons I could get.<br>
<br>
Could anyone offer some advice on a solid DW build?  The DW discussion focuses on toons that are T9-geared, but doesn't help a new 80.<br>
<br>
My preference is an unholy build, because I far prefer that playstyle to frost, but if frost is ahead by a large margin, I'll make the switch.<br>
<br>
Thanks.<br>
<br>
Edit:  I notice in my current gear/spec that blood boil does significant'y more dmg than blood strike - is this normal in a DW unholy build?<br>
<br>
Edit #2: When I gear up and pick up a good 2H, I'll switch to a 2H unholy build, and I've fully read the thread on 2H unholy.  Just need advice for the gearing up process - currently only 2.8-3.1k dps in the current gear/build, want to see how I can bump that up.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>The only time Rune Strike will be proccing is if you are tanking.  If you are tanking RS is significantly better to use in place of DC.  As a DPS the only time RS *may* be proccing is on AoE trash, possibly during an early pickup on Anub 25h burrowers, or a really bad tank, so you're free to macro it to every ability if you want, but you shouldn't have to worry about priorities on DC vs RS.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

No doubt the Edge is far better for DPS set, but is it better for Tanking Set as well? I wonder it is (even if it has a abit less strenght and stamina) since it also has less hit rating, with which I'm over 8% for melee, but close to 11% for spell. Would my TPS be lowered by risking to miss a HB/IT for the lower spell hit?<br>

		<div id="post_message_1446930"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I've spent the morning looking at various sources to figure out how Armor Pen specifically affects my primary attacks as a Blood DK. Could someone more versed at TC confirm my assumptions below? Some of the articles on Wowwiki I found were out of date.<br>
<br>
1. Armor Pen offsets the amount of damage we lose when hitting a boss. A boss typically has 13083 armor and that reduces our damage by 46.2% [(13083/(13083+15232.5)] <br>
<br>
2. The Armor Pen cap for a level 83 boss is 9906 [(13083+16635)/3]<br>
<br>
With these assumptions, I end up with this formula for figuring out how ArP affects damage:<br>
<br>
Base Boss Armor Reduction - Adjusted for ArP Boss Armor Reduction<br>
(13083/(13083+15232.5)) - ((13083-(9906*ArPen%))/((13083-(9906*ArPen%))+15232.5))<br>
<br>
The reason I'm confused is because it looks to me like the more ArP you have the better it gets and the decision on when to gem ArP really doesn't have a lot to do with how much AP you have, it depends on how much ArP you have.<br>
<br>
Here's a link to what I've got: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100317140317/http://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AtstQrpHI4NgdHY2RUJCcVJyWVBIbHZvdHdWX1FhaGc&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">http://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?k...WX1FhaGc&amp;hl=en</a><br>
<br>
Also, I assume normalized weapon damage is still calculated as Base Weapon Damage + ATK/14 * 3.3+Bonus (Base Weapon Damage can be calculated as top damage on weapon + bottom damage on weapon /2) and this is what we apply as "weapon damage" in our attack's tooltip.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1447020"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->You're correct in realizing that ArPen has "positive feedback"; the more of it you have, the more valuable it becomes. However, it's relative value when compared with other stats is affected by how much of the stat you are comparring it to you have. For example, if I am comparing the worth of ArPen to attack power and I have very little AP, the relative value of ArPen when compared to attack power dimishes. It's value will increase as I stack more and more AP until I reach a theoretical breaking point (which is a function both of ArPen and AP). This breaking point has never been reliably calculated (though the math to do so is actually fairly simple, I would have done it long ago except I'm really lazy).  That being said, the decision to gem armor penetration will never be cut and dry simply because of how necessary AoE is in many encounters and how little DK AoE damage is affected by ArPen. Furthermore, different specs get different mileage from similar amounts of ArPen, just because of how their damage breakdown is split.<br>
<br>
edit: looking at your formula, it looks like you got a few numbers wrong. With 100% ArPen, the boss should have 0 armor; your formula gives a different result. Did you not account for the pre-reduction effects of Sunder and Faerie Fire?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1447064"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->This is going to boil down to a basic gear question, and for that I'm sorry. It's just that I've tried everything I know to do as a player, and I can't find my answer.<br>
<br>
Basically, I have a 0/53/18 DW Frost DK.  He has three weapons. The <a id="itemlink" class="q4" style=" font-weight: bold;" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100317140317/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=48663" target="_blank">[Tankard O' Terror]</a>, 10 man normal ilvl 232 of <a id="itemlink" class="q4" style=" font-weight: bold;" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100317140317/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=47973" target="_blank">[The Grinder]</a>, and <a id="itemlink" class="q4" style=" font-weight: bold;" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100317140317/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=49296" target="_blank">[Singed Vis'kag the Bloodletter]</a>.<br>
<br>
I'm confused by my results from the tools.  I've used Rawr - it says Grinder/Tankard is the best. TeamRobot says Viskag/Grinder is the best, and I'm just getting confused the entire way around. I've searched up and down on the forums, but I honestly get confused easily too.<br>
<br>
Can anyone hopefully straighten me out and teach me something? I've been trying to figure this out for a few days before I finally broke down and realized I'm not figuring it out on my own.<br>
<br>
If that damn sword just had stats like a normal weapon, this wouldn't be an issue.  Thanks for reading my wall of text, I apologize for it. I realize my question in the immediate sense is about the weapons, but in the greater sense I want to know if I'm doing anything wrong with the tools or if they simply disagree on the items.

</div>A combonation of JoL, Imp. LotP, Blood Presence (10000 dps with adds up means a hefty amount of healing) and Unholy Strength procs means my healers never have to bother healing our DKs when they don't have PC. I don't know much about Death Strike, but I imagine that it would be better to avoid it in order to keep the Anub healing to an absolute minimum. As such, you're probably better off swapping to a different spec for this fight as the damage loss from no longer using Death Strike and it's consequences (no Death Runes, being forced to reapply diseases etc.) will by substantial.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>1. Boss armor was reduced in 3.1 (I think, whenever sunder was nerfed).  Base armor for bosses is now 10643.<br>
2. The armor pen cap is based off _your_ armor coefficient, not the boss/lv83 coefficient.  So ArP cap for boss is (10643+15232.5)/3 = 8625.  However, a more relevant number is the cap of 7774 against a boss afflicted by sunder/ff, whose armor has been reduced to 8089.<br>
<br>
The math you follow up with doesn't look quite right.  Without inspecting your spreadsheet, the easiest way to calculate post-arp mitigation is simply to calculate the boss' effective armor after your ArP is applied, then plug into the mitigation formula.  So if you have 50% ArP on gear and blood gorged, and are attacking a fully debuffed boss, you just subtract 60% of the ArP cap from the boss' armor, leaving about 3425 armor, and 18.35% mitigation.<br>
<br>
In any case, your conclusion that ArP provides increasing gains as you get more of it is correct.  As a general point of reference, the last few points of ArP rating are roughly half again more valuable than the first few.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Since we have such a rapid rotation and this spec does utilizes 2 points in unholy tree's "Viscious Strikes" that increases our plague stikes critical chance by 6% plus increases the bonus critical dmg by another 30%. Would it be beneficial to remove 3 points out of Necrosis and place them in Outbreak to further increase the dmg out this physical strike? Also curious on perhaps even glyphing for plague strike on how that might pan out. Anyone have any experience with this or simulated it out before?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">My question is to the Blood DPS spec. Since we have such a rapid rotation and this spec does utilizes 2 points in unholy tree's "Viscious Strikes" that increases our plague stikes critical chance by 6% plus increases the bonus critical dmg by another 30%. Would it be beneficial to remove 3 points out of Necrosis and place them in Outbreak to further increase the dmg out this physical strike? Also curious on perhaps even glyphing for plague strike on how that might pan out. Anyone have any experience with this or simulated it out before?</div>

	</tr>

</div>You put 2 points in Vicious Strikes because there is no other place to put them. So, no, 3 points for a 30% damage increase of a strike you use once every 20 seconds is not worth it. Same reasoning regarding the glyph.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>the thing of it is, my rotation isnt 20 seconds, more like 10 seconds. With a standard rotation of PS,IT,HSx4,DS,DCx2. With that in mind (unless my rotation needs to be adjusted) since I would be using the PS more frequntly, does 5 pts in Necrosis really pull out aheaad vs having 3 pts in Outbreak and leaving 2 in Necrosis? From my experience on the dummy my PS criticals hit just under 6k with the 3 pts in Outbreak vs being under 3.4k w/o..  and regular hits bering around a 700 dmg difference (give or take). <br>
Another thing does PS scale better with ArP vs Necrosis, or do they scale the same?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Ofcourse it's worth it. Seeing how you're on the DK forums, most people will agree with me. <br>
<br>
They're accepted into any raid that isn't already full of them. Tanking on the other hand is another quesiton...<br>
<br>
In my opinion you shouldn't roll a class based on which place they end up on the meters. By the time you reach 80 and get the gear to start competing, things might have changed, and will definitely continue to do so in the future.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Saying "without hitting DR" is misleading at best.  There is no point at which dodge/parry aren't affected by diminishing returns, and it's not like those diminishing returns accelerate when your defense skill hits 540.  DRs on dodge/parry include all contributions to those stats--defense rating as well as dodge rating/agility/parry rating/strength.  They do NOT include dodge/parry from talents and runeforges, including defense from SSG.  The only significance of 540 defense is that it makes raid bosses unable to crit you; it is only a small part of your total avoidance.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Both rotations that you've mentioned are impossible due to the simple reason that you have 2 of each rune.  Once you do <font color="Blue">IT&gt;PS&gt;Pest&gt;DND</font> you have no runes left (DND uses 1 of each rune... I knew that:P ) which is why you need to use the following 2 rotations<br>

I suppose the Ensidia rotation is for a talent spec without Epidemic (which is until 3.3 still the highest Unholy single target DPS spec, although some people spec Epidemic specifically for Anub). If you have Epidemic in your spec for Anub there is no reason to reapply / spread diseases every 10 seconds.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1459024"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Quel'Delar, the epic quest sword has been revealed on the PTR, and can be seen <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100317140317/http://www.mmo-champion.com/news-2/icecrown-5-man-dungeons-loot/" target="_blank">here</a>.<br>
<br>
There are three versions that could possibly be used by DK Tanks:<br>
<blockquote>Quel'Delar, Might of the Faithful<br>
Sword<br>
Two-Hand<br>
Speed 3.60<br>
769 - 1155 Damage<br>
(267.2 damage per second)<br>
+164 Strength<br>
+164 Stamina<br>
Item Level 251<br>
Equip: Improves haste rating by 91.<br>
Equip: Improves critical strike rating by 99.</blockquote><br>
Strength and Stamina on this look good, however haste and crit are not important for DK Tanks. For DK Tanks having only something like Justicebringer this could be a minor upgrade.<br>
<br>
<blockquote>Quel'Delar, Ferocity of the Scorned<br>
Sword<br>
Two-Hand<br>
Speed 3.40<br>
727 - 1091 Damage<br>
(267.4 damage per second)<br>
+144 Agility<br>
+136 Stamina<br>
Item Level 251<br>
Equip: Increases attack power by 197.<br>
Equip: Improves critical strike rating by 99.<br>
Equip: Increases your armor penetration rating by 91</blockquote>Low Stamina and Agility make this not interesting.<br>
<br>
<blockquote>Lightborn Spire<br>
Mace<br>
Two-Hand<br>
Speed 3.20<br>
684 - 1026 Damage<br>
(267.2 damage per second)<br>
+144 Agility<br>
+144 Stamina<br>
Item Level 251<br>
Equip: Increases attack power by 191.<br>
Equip: Improves critical strike rating by 103.<br>
Equip: Increases your expertise rating by 84.</blockquote>It could be interesting because of the expertise, however the stamina is low.<br>

</div>These will be good items for casual DK tanks that never got a Justicebringer.  The Mace is the most "tank", while it has 20 less stamina than the first item, agility &gt; strength for a DK tank for EH (not that either is that useful).<br>
<br>
What is interesting is they put Agility and Expertise on a 2H weapon again (last time it was on that trash drop Naxx Mace), so that would also be nice for a Druid as well.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

My average dps was higher, but I'm not sure if that was the bonus in action or just the better gear. Does the effect normally show in the default Blizz FCT as a normal "sticky" crit, or just doubled damage? If it's not a direct link and 1/10 ticks is normal, that'll become 1/20 when 3.3 changes it to remove Frost Fever.<br>

</div>Ah, a perfectly logical answer. That makes total sense. I assumed Kings, Sanc, Windfury and my own buffs would be the brunt of the dps boosts, but now I realize raid DEBUFFS play a part as well, along with time on target. I also assumed 5man aoe would be about the same as 10/25-man, but I'm guessing the same things apply.<br>

</div>The set bonus scales with your own crit percentage, although I'm not sure if it was spell crit or melee crit chance. Looking at my recent parses doesn't give an answer, either, since the disease crit percentage is always less than the melee crit percentage, but above the death and decay crit percentage. But the answer must be somewhere in the threads.<br>
<br>
It is usually around 40ish percent, so definitely worthwile. Do you track your disease crits by looking at the scrolling combat text or do you use Recount or something similar? By simply relying on SCT it's near impossible to really get the correct impression of your number of crits. Besides, what Darkside mentioned also applies here, full raid buffs also increase your crit chance by quite a bit (although 10% is unrealistically low).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Percentage bonuses from buffs and talents are multiplicative, so they all affect each other, yes. The HoW flat bonus is just added on before multipliers. "Double-dipping" usually refers to an ability benefiting twice from raid buffs, or from two different types of buffs that aren't normally meant to overlap (i.e. melee and spell raid buffs).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Take your base attribute.  Add bonus to that attribute from gear/enchants/gems.  Add bonus from buffs, such as Horn of Winter or Strength of Earth Totems, Mark of the Wild, etc.<br>

		<div id="post_message_1465177"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->First off, here's a link to my armory: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100213220156/http://www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Shandris&amp;n=Sabellian" target="_blank"><b>Sabellian</b></a><br>
<br>
As you can see, I'm <i>sorely</i> lacking expertise, and there isn't much gear that I can see myself getting with my guild's current progression status that can help me to remedy this. Tonight, while running TotGC10, I received these: <a id="itemlink" class="q4" style=" font-weight: bold;" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100213220156/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=47990" target="_blank">[Gauntlets of Mounting Anger]</a>. What I was wondering was how I should fill the yellow socket. Normally I'd throw a +20 Cardinal Ruby in there without a second thought, but the expertise issue is really starting to frustrate me. Is there a better way for me to get at least <i>some</i> of that much-needed expertise through gems?<br>
<br>
To give an idea as to my progression and what's available to me, we're currently struggling to down Faction Champions in TotGC10, and the only hard-modes we haven't done in Ulduar are Mimiron, Yogg-Saron, and Algalon (all of which are to some degree in sight; we've been working on them, but progress is slow). Everything else is obviously done, and with the except our GM's struggle to pull together a halfway decent 25 group by the time Icecrown comes out, we're effectively a 10man guild.<br>
<br>
I know a lot of Icecrown loot is decked in expertise, and I was wondering if anyone had any advice on how I could handle this.<br>
<br>
Thanks.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1473066"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I'm researching DK DPS classes to decide which talent tree I want to pursue and am stymied by a major inconsistency that I hope someone can help me resolve.<br>
<br>
I have looked up a number of Unholy DK DPS guides, both here at EJ and elsewhere, and found that they concede best single-target DPS to the Blood class. I grant that nearly all of them haven't been updated in the past three months and many don't specifically address 3.2.2 changes, however minimal.<br>
<br>
However, excluding Faction Champions, and with the realization that there are two bosses to DPS during Val'kyr Twins and Northern Beasts (albeit nerfed damage to the former and partial availability of the latter), and lastly assuming accurate results from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100213220156/http://www.wowmeteronline.com/rank/clazz/dtb/dkt/8/0/3/320" target="_blank">Player Ranking - DPS to Bosses - Death Knight - All Region - Normal Mode(25)</a>, of the top 80 DKs to DPS a ToGC25 boss:<br>
<br>
00 are Frost,<br>
13 are Blood, and<br>
67 are Unholy.<br>

What am I missing? Is there something simple that explain this disconnect?<br>

		<div id="post_message_1473122"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->@Yoricome: Yes, they still stack. Why wouldn't it be intended?<br>
<br>
@Duress: The main reason for the disconnect is the fact that not a single fight in TotC/TotGC is single target, as you yourself admit: Twins and Beasts included (you seem to underestimate the dps gained on these fights by being able to pest and such). That's the key. <br>
<br>
A second target will inflate Unholy dps enough to surpass that of Blood, since the gap isn't all that huge to begin with.<br>
<br>
If there was a Patchwerk-esqe fight in TotC/TotGC, yes, Blood would almost certainly have high representation.<br>
<br>
Besides, WMO records are not a good way to measure the strengths of different specs, for a variety of reasons.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>It's not the number of bosses, it's the number of targets.<br>
<br>
Northrend Beasts has during the Gormok phase most of the time two targets (snobold and boss, at least if you let melee kill snobolds), until the first worm dies you have two targets during the worm phase and during Icehowl you are frequently not in melee range to the boss (kick) or can't actively do DPS (massive crash), so that things like disease ticks and death &amp; decay (where Unholy is strong) account for a higher percentage of your damage.<br>
Jaraxxus has mutiple targets throughout the encounter. Diseases / D&amp;D on three infernals before turning back on the boss yield a massive DPS increase.<br>
Wandering Plague damage double dips on the damage buffs during the Twins encounter, yielding a high DPS increase for Unholy.<br>
Anub'arak has lots of adds leading to lots of Unholy DPS.<br>
<br>
Also, you have to consider how many players play each spec, if there are only few well equipped Frost DKs around who upload on WMO, it's not surprising that there are few aming the top parses.

		<div id="post_message_1475072"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->So, I'm a bit confused; in the DK FAQ post it says something along the lines of DnD being a threat multiplyer... now does that only consist of DnD damage being multiplied by 1.9 or whatever the number was, or will it multiply the threat of all attacks done while a target is affected by DnD?<br>
<br>
If you need an example, if i drop DnD and then do a Heart Strike, will the threat from Heart Strike be multiplied by 1.9 of what it would have been without DnD present?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1475932"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->It definitely has to be a bug, I tried to watch my runes carefully while raiding last night, and also pay attention to other error messages, and when I would try to Death Strike with no runes the error would read "This ability is not ready".  I couldn't pinpoint if it was in fact misrepresenting the cooldown or not, but it does severely gimp my dps when it happens.  That combined with the fact that my rotation is usually fluid and I can 'feel' which ability is going to be next makes me think it might be more than a UI display issue.  But maybe I'm totally incorrect.  I'm going to pay closer attention and try to catch it and report back.  Thanks for the replies gentlemen.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>There is alot of changes across the board, but nothing that will effect the relativity of each tree's numbers (before anybody jumps on that comment, I mean by a substantial amount).<br>
<br>
Having said that, one of those changes is UH DW not being competitive with Fr DW anymore.  You will want to be taking advantage of UH DW now, but going back to Fr DW when 3.3 drops.  So make sure your off-hand is a slow one now, before you get caught with something that gimps your DPS on patch day.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1479606"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->You can't accurately take into account IBF, unless you assume it's used as soon as it's cooled. Simulating an emergency ability is quite pointless. It's not like an on-use dps trinket, which you can accurately say "I'll use it as soon as it's cooled".<br>
<br>
Aside from that point, the increase to IBF will be totally trivial from 16 def.<br>
<br>
For most intents and purposes, Rawr reports priorities based on weighting. That means, the data you get out depends on how much you tell it to value everything. Is 10hp better than 0.04% dodge? It's a fallacy to suggest either yes or no.<br>
<br>
Going by the default weightings in Rawr.TankDK, raidbffed (which is to the advantage of Agi) 225 armor is superior, provided you're def-capped. Closely followed by 22Agi, which also has a tiny benefit in threat terms. Last comes in Defence.<br>
<br>
Essentially the difference is that Armor is mitigation, Agi is evasion and Defence is slightly less evasion. Frankly you're clutching at straws if you're trying to work out which one is superior.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I've been stuck with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100225133243/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=40406" target="_blank">Inevitable Defeat</a> - which I've been using for tanking as well as dps'ing (!) - for a veeery long time now (having to go to Acherus Hold to re-runeforge everytime you need to change specs is *damn* annoying). I recently got <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100225133243/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=47834" target="_blank">Fordragon Blades</a> from Anub'Arak in ToC10, not a typical DK weapon - at all - I know.<br>
<br>
Since I've gotten it (no one else needed it, and I wasn't certain if I'd get an actual DPS upgrade from it) I've been trying to test my dps on dummies, 1 minute fights, 2 minute fights and 5 minute fights using EXACTLY the same rotation (IT, PS, DS, HS, HS, HoW, DC (1x), DS, HS, HS, HS, HS and from there on PS, DS, HS, HS, DC (1/2x), DS, HS, HS, HS, HS)<br>
for the duration of whatever fight I was doing. I would always complete the rotation so fights would never end on exactly x minutes, but as soon as the timer "ended" I'd stop after my current rotation.<br>
<br>
I've almost not been able to see any dps difference (only based on i.e. grim toll procs) at all. The very few times I've had the same procs, Fordragon Blades have had a very slight edge. We're talking sub 100 dps, often sub 50 dps. Now my question is: Would it be viable to use this weapon for dpsing? I imagine Inevitable Defeat (since it has strength) will scale better with buffs, and therefore be a much better weapon for any raid than Fordragon Blades will be.<br>
<br>
Do you guys have any suggestions? Should I use Fordragon Blades or Inevitable Defeat for dpsing? I'm also a blood tank offspec, should I keep using ID for that, or switch to using FB for that? Thanks in advance.<br>

</div>I'm sorry, I was unclear about the matter of stopping after a rotation. I've done both exact timed "events" and stopped at the end of a duration. It hasn't changed much for me.<br>
<br>
I'm aware training dummies are not the best simulation - however, before I have a raid again, it's what I have :-) The poor dps increase that I was referring to made me believe Inevitable Defeat might actually be better with stat increasements (kings). <br>

I'll be trying Fordragon Blade in my next raid and report back. Thanks for your assistance <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100225133243im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":)" class="inlineimg"><!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I never could get the easy macro to work so I what I use (since I always have Grid open for raid frames), is a simple mouseover macro for Raise dead, then mouseover the "Dead" icon on Grid. <br>

The proc is nice, as it autoheals, and we'd need more information on how often it procs, but I think that I would stick with something that has expertise and AP.<br>

</div>Byrntroll has approximately a 15% proc rate.  Autoattack and other melee attacks are valid sources of proc.  Spelldamage does not proc.  The first strike of AOE/cleave attacks can proc, the additional strikes will not proc.<br>
<br>
Here's the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100225133243/http://elitistjerks.com/f76/t77418-retribution_3_3_ptr_changes/p11/#post1480251" target="_blank">Paladin 3.3 PTR thread</a> where a Bryntroll was tested extensively.<br>
<br>
Due to Ret Paladin seal mechanics, it's slightly better for single-target Ret usage than DK or Warrior DPS usage (SoV uses a second fake autoattack mechanic to apply stacks - this hidden attack can proc Bryntroll).  There is some thought that DK would be superior to Warrior due to proc interaction with self-buff talents.<br>
<br>
Regarding tanking purposes, a Blood Tank has a heavy degree of self-healing, this certainly would not be a bad addition to such.  The self-healing would also be decent single-target threat.  No real advantages for AOE tanking.<br>
<br>
There is no real disadvantage to using Bryntroll for tanking - for once the proc seems worth the lack of hit/crit/haste/armpen/expertise, especially with the Str and sockets.<br>
<br>
It should dish out decent threat.  As always the decision is up to you and your guild whether a specific 2H is better for the DK tank or for melee DPS.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Will one scale with gear better than the other? If this question cannot be answered yet, I apologize.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1489696"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->So I really like unholy dps. but I also like doing a lot of damage. on a normal boss fight blood is the way to go(maybe on trash 2 mobs or less due to heart strike as well). but wouldn't it be "best" to switch to unholy for trash pulls of 3 or more mobs? If that is the case shouldn't there be an unholy spec designed 100% just for aoe.<br>
<br>
So i am thinking that first i need a unholy dps trash spec <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091231030942/http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?deathknight#_CJEB8r34aJZ7P,dSpqe3,10958" target="_blank">http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?deat...P,dSpqe3,10958</a> (maybe corpse explosion could be used hear). second i need a way to change specs easily, for this im thinking if i had a macro that changed my spec depending on what stance i was in. blood spec with blood stance, unholy spec for unholy stance. im well aware that the conventional thinking is that blood is always the better stance... but for trash would the ability to move faster to keep up with the mobs moving around be better? also trash normally die very quick so don't i wanna attack fast and have my runes always ready?<br>
<br>
any help on this macro?<br>
any thoughts?<br>
<br>

</div>Reaping costs three talent points. So, while SS is always better than two BS, with current gear it is not better than two BS AND spending those three talent points differently (i.e. Dark Conviction). So the real comparison is SS vs. 2 BS + 3% Crit and SS will not win this competition before a few pieces of ICC gear or 2pT10 have been acquired.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I am a blood death knight, typical spec 51/0/20. The Might version has all that strength going for it, obviously, while the ferocity has the attack power (inferior to ST I know, but helps make up for not having said ST) and a bunch of armor pen.

Am I correct in assuming that expertise is a more important stat for building threat than hit?  If so is it ok to drop about 50 hit rating if the piece is an overal upgrade in mitigation/avoidance?</div>

	</tbody></table>
</div>You can't compare tanking stats that are unrelated. It's acceptable to compare stats in a DPS class/spec because all stats, more or less, affect DPS. A tank has three primary functions: Avoidance, Effective Health and Threat.<br>
<br>
Is it acceptable to drop Threat for increased Avoidance? There is no answer to that: It may be, it depends.<br>
<br>
Going under the 8% hit barrier risks putting you in a position where your Dark Command will be resisted. We are lucky in that we have a second taunt with Death Grip, but if you were planning to taunt two adds, that may result in a very messy pull. I'm fairly certain you get the same amount of % to hit (about 32 Hit Rate per % hit and about 33 Exp Rate per % bypassed) however, Exp also mitigates Parry, and Hit ensures your abilities work.<br>
<br>
Which is more valuable? Up to you to decide. Thankfully, there are both Hit and Exp foods which are cheap to make and infinitely more useful than the 80AP Feast gives.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1493062"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I'm curious what people are doing about expertise.

		<div id="post_message_1494891"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I have a rather extensive query about antimagic shell. Specifically, it's use in tanking with respect to the "preventing application of harmful magical effects" component.<br>
<br>
I have been trying to use it as an anti-fear device. While I can accurately time it to avoid the fear on, for example, Bronjahm or the mobs at the end of DTK, I've never succeeded in avoiding a fear cast by Onyxia, whether I'm tanking her or not. At first I suspected that I was casting it too soon, and she was simply depleting it (with magic damage) before it got the chance to prevent the fear effect, but lately I've noticed it's still around me while I'm being feared.<br>
<br>
Is there some specific strange behaviour keeping this preventative CD from functioning correctly, or am I doing something wrong? How is it possible that I cast the AMS just before her fear, then get feared with it on? The only thing I can suspect is that AMS will prevent <i>either </i>an effect<i> or </i>damage, but perhaps not both, and some elementary damage (just before the fear) is tagging it as a "damage shield" rather than a "debuff shield"?<br>
<br>
Also, are there any other raid tanking scenaria where using AMS as debuff-control (instead of damage absorbtion) is useful? I've yet to locate any.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Yogg-Saron hard mode (infinitely useful for melee, probably less so for a tank), Hodir (again probably more useful as dps rather than tank), Northrend Beasts (poison application), Faction Champions, probably more but those are the ones that come to mind at the moment.<br>

The main problem is that you don't have reliable timers for the things that would be very nice to avoid if you could, and they're instant cast and/or boss isn't switching target while doing it.

</div>Don't misunderstand the discussion about Needle. It's not a bad trinket, it just doesn't stack up very well to some of the trinkets that might be considered BiS. Darkmoon Card: Greatness is still a great trinket, Mjolnir Runestone, for frost at least, might roughly come out to 187.7 + (10/45*1051) = 421 compared to the others in the frost thread. Note that this formula is largely inaccurate for actually rating the dps increase, and is just meant to give a rough numerical value to a trinket based on its internal cooldown and duration.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

If you check my armory I moved it into Corpse Explosion just for messing around in heroics, and it does surprisingly well for AOE, but  I don't think that's where that last talent point's home will be come raid time.<br>
<br>
I'm also having trouble delegating talent points in general. I only ever played Frost and Blood, where I had a few talent points extra floating around to put into utility talents, where as in Unholy, just to get all the DPS talents I'm looking at 57pts in that tree alone.<br>

</div>If we're talking directly from a stats and damage point of view, +21 crit is more desirable over agility because it applies to both melee and spell damage, whereas agility only affects melee crit. Most guides say that you should use the +21 agility metagem because its easier to activate with your gems. The crit rating gems requires 2 blue gems to be socketed for it to activate, most of the gems that we want, regardless of socket color, are red, as in bold cardinal ruby etc. So it's easier to use the agility meta because we can activate without taking a +20 strength loss. I'm not sure if the math has been done, but its possible that using the agility gem ends up in higher DPS because we can socket strength gems.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
I have been playing around with Frost DW Spec - According to Darks guide it should traditionally pull LOWER DPS. However I do about 3700 Single Target DPS to the lvl 80 boss target dummy, Using Ghoulslice and nighttime as weapons.<br>
<br>
However when I go Unholy, using a ulduar 2 hander. I cannot push higher then 2500 with garg and pets going.<br>

My question inlies here. how much Hit do I require while dual wielding and when not? Also how much expertise would I require to be capped for both specs? <br>
<br>
And should I worry about crit? Whats the cap?<br>
<br>
And when using Frost DW is it better to use 2 slow weappons or 1 slow 1 fast?<br>
<br>
and 3rd in personal opinion which sigil should I get for both specs? - Honestly Ive looked and theres alot of indecisive controversy so I'm simply looking for perhaps a little more guidance then put forth in some of the DK guides.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>With Nerves of Cold Steel you should be striving for 8% melee hit and about 11% spell hit. I think having 8% in rating will give you the spell hit you need.<br>
<br>
With Frost DW it is best to have two slow weapons. This is because of the higher damage output in the damage range (ie <a id="itemlink" class="q4" style=" font-weight: bold;" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091231012231/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=50191" target="_blank">[Nighttime]</a> has a damage range of 325-605, so 605 is the high end). With faster weapons, you may have the same total DPS for the weapon, but the top line damage is going to be less, making for softer hits with your specials like Frost Strike and Oblit.<br>
<br>
<a id="itemlink" class="q4" style=" font-weight: bold;" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20091231012231/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=40207" target="_blank">[Sigil of Awareness]</a> is very good for frost dual wield. I'm not sure that a new sigil for 3.3 has been decided to replace it, but SoA was close to BiS, if not best for frost dual wield in 3.1 and 3.2.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1497693"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Hi, I have a quick question about crit immunity. My DK is sitting at about 556 Def at the moment, (can't get rid of that damn repelling charge), and I have noticed seemingly since the patch that I am getting CRIT like a mother. Mostly in heroics, bosses crit me all the time. Is there an explanation for this? DKs take spikey enough damage as it is, but when my poor low health pool DK is tanking Heroic HoR, I can't afford random crits. I am not talking about being hit from behind or anything, mind you. For example, I was helping my friend with H ToC for a drop for him and in p1 of the Black Knight fight I got crit for his first melee swing. What is up?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>If we're looking strictly at stat changes that will make the most difference to your DPS, you might want to switch out the pants, helm or chest first. I'm not familiar with how these are acquired, but if its available by emblem, then I'd imagine that the pants, helmet and chest are worth a little more to get than the gloves and shoulders, so if you have a small intake of emblems, then you might choose the gloves and shoulders first. If you are getting these from token drops from bosses, then it won't matter too much, and you should go for the more expensive pieces. Here are the strength changes between each piece (I'm assuming normal T10 and not heroic).<br>
<br>
You will gain 22 strength when you replace each the shoulders and gloves.<br>
You will gain 30 strength when you replace each of the pants, helmet and chest.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Thank you for your response...As i have been asking around, i have been told that in BC, there were some mobs that had a higher chance to crit, in SL or something, and there may be others. This is not the case, thought, as today I was running H HoL and I was crit for ~2.7k by one of the fire revenants. I think my weapon enchant is bugged (SSG), so i am going to re-runeforge it. Hopefuly that will take care of it. I am now at 239 Defense because I was able to swtich my Repelling Charge out with Essence of Gossamer, which is still fine for heroics.I am at 543 if I put on a 213 ilvl cloak i have for Def rating but I only switch it out if I am running a raid. Unfortunately in HoL today when I got crit my combat log was bugged and not taking in any information, so I told the same friend that said that there were SL mobs that had a higher crit % to check his log and he said he found "XXXX Hits Nanciee for 27xx melee swing (Critical)" just as I suspected. I will make full screenshots next time I catch it barring my combat log being bugged again to show you. Thanks.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I'm curious what people are doing about expertise.  For the longest time I was ignoring it since lower gear seemed to have enough on it. With ToC gear I became expertise starved and started getting a lot of dodges, and I mean a lot.<br>

I am looking to replace it as soon as something better comes along however.<br>
<br>
So my questions are should I be gunning for some magical softcap number and is it worth gemming expertise over strength untill I get some more exp gear?</div>

</div>FS/DC macro: No, you'll have to manually switch buttons.<br>
<br>
I can't think of any compelling reason to use only one disease, esp. if you're AoE tanking. You might end up using one disease for a portion of the fight (the pickup, i.e. HB -&gt; DND -&gt; BB) but you should probably always have two diseases rolling on all possible targets for maximum threat.<br>
<br>
e: VVV You can write a modifier macro, (or just bind a modifier key to those attacks), but you won't be able to write a "smart" macro that auto-switches for you.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
As my guild progressed and killed AB 25 hc we got our 258 tokens, now after few weeks of farming it and farming DKP i finally got enough of it to get more then one. Tho luck didnt smile to me until tonight where i got my 1st token, and hopefully soon the other, so 1st in line of questions is what part of 245 ilvl set i should replace, got frostborn chest from heroic mode so thats good start for getting bis for tier 9 loot table. Rest of them are set items. I am talking about DPS gear ofc, but i get that is self-explanatory. I already got one piece of 264 set and next week ill get another one, even tho ill need some more time to farm badges for it. My second question is kinda related to the 1st one, "which one should i replace" and is more oriented should i even replace it. I was looking at shadows edge the other day and realized that with 4 alts, and main included, it takes you a month to get all of primorial saronites, few days more less. And when i look at DPS set bonus its more worth to have 4 pieces of tier 9 258 then 2 parts of tier 10. So i am in doubt there and need some advices. My current weapon is tribute chest 10 man and its pretty good but now as ilvl of me and my fellow 2h users raise its kinda becoming outdated. So i was thinking if Shadows Edge or even Bryntroll are good choices till heroic mode of ICC is released.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>In 5 mans and sometimes in 10 mans DW frost will mostly generate more threat (on the basis that blood generally requires both buffs and debuffs to adequately perform threat, not that it doesn't generate plenty as is, just that it's sub par in 5m and some 10m).  It provides more armor (agility), and I believe more avoidance (but that was only true of the old 1.5s speed weapons, I haven't figured what the difference is now between two Hellscream Slicers and Mor'Kosh, as an example).  Frost cooldowns are nicer in 5s, especially the longer duration of IBF, in comparison to bloods cooldowns which are much more targeted towards large health pools to buffer incoming heals.<br>
<br>
It's something I'll be testing quite a bit further into the week, but for now if you have the DW weapons and not the 2h then by all means it's fine.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1502919"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I have been attempting to search for this information but apparently I am having no luck.  A friend of mine obtained a Deathbringer's Will on his DK which he typically plays as Blood.  I read in the Frost DW thread that the procs for a DK are Haste, Crit and Str.  However, my friend (Ahi of Laughing Skull) states that as Blood he was getting two different Iron Dwarves, one with a crit proc and the other with an Arp proc and then he'd get a Tauren with a Str proc.<br>
<br>
We were curious so he respec'd to Unholy and Frost.  The following are the results from all three specs.<br>
<br>
Unholy - Crit, Str, Haste<br>
Blood - Crit, Str, Arp<br>
Frost - Crit, Str, Arp<br>

Here goes my question: is it normal for my Blood spec to constantly outdps my Unholy spec ( we are talking  51/0/20 vs 17/0/54 single target version here) on Boss target dummy by 200-400 dps? (cant say anything for sure about real raid environment) Or maybe my parses are too short (doing mostly 4-minute tests just to include couple of gargoyle/hyst cds)? I keep reading how Unholy beats pretty much every other spec nowadays, even on ST fights. Does it mean it scales so much better with raid buffs? Or is it my gear/gemming that is more blood-centric (doubt it as Ive always been short on arp). Pretty sure I'm doing everything fine rotationwise as I'm usually topping meters  no matter what spec I use.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I've been away from WoW for a couple of months and now I see that DW tanking builds have come viable. My question is how Frost DW tanking is compared to Frost 2H tanking? Any major differences in threat, stat bonuses or do they both perform equally well?</div>

</div>I've been thinking of the exact same question. The talent points is really tense for a DW tanking build， and you could save up 6 points with a normal 2H Frost tanking build, which can be invested to other useful talents.  DW tank do have a little bit higher avoidance as you can use 2 tanking weapons, but not too much a benefit in my PoV.

As for DW tanking I do not see it working in serious content without two slow 1h tanking weapons which do not and will not exist. DW tanking feels to me like 2h Enhancement Shaman. Just go 2h Blood if you want to tank stuff.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1504610"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->So for the sake of my own guild's progression, I've been tossing around the idea, once I get my computer hardware updated(my processor is going out thus my PC at present cannot handle raiding), of attempting to main tank our icecrown runs.<br>
<br>
Problem is I'm unsure of what numbers I should shoot for.  My original aim was to hit 38k hp and 65-70% avoidance unbuffed as unholy(following which I'm still debating unholy vs blood depending on if I have difficulty with threat gen vs our dps or not, personally I prefer unholy's flexibility over Blood's pure single target threat, as our other DK tank, whom is blood, cannot seem to hold aggro on trash pulls and multiple target situations).  I do not want to spec frost as I like having the availability of the superior death strike self healing that both unholy and blood have present(although unholy has to sacrifice some threat if they want the self healing).<br>
<br>
That said, after running some numbers I'm having difficulty coming up with a suitable tanking setup without relying on raid drops.  My current gear is in my armory profile, but I'm hesitant on shelling out 10-20k gold on materials and such for things like full crafted ToC25 items, the Frost Emblem tanking trinket(not shelling out gold for this obviously), and maxing both jewelcrafting and blacksmithing for the sake of hitting my projected numbers without relying on ToC drops(which are unreliable considering I'm attempting to be available for tanking sooner rather than later).<br>
<br>
What unbuffed/buffed tanking stats are recommended?  A paladin tank I know is packing 2-3k block value, 45k unbuffed hp and some 70% unbuffed avoidance(sans block), but DK tanks gear differently and he also overgears the first wing most likely.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1504685"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I have been using various simulators and looking at posted results in these forums and have noticed that DW frost builds tend to sim 10-20% higher than Unholy which is 1-2% higher than Blood. I have been using the standardized builds and glyph setups and as close to the same set of gear (trying to get comparable 2h and DW weps) for each simulation. In short, I try to keep things as simple and constant as possible.<br>
<br>
<i>The question is: Why does DW Frost simulate so much higher than the other two trees but not actually produce those results in practice?</i><br>

The only thing I can think of is that the nature of the more demanding proc based priority of Frost makes it much harder to use effectively and efficiently in a boss encounter and the simulators can simply take perfect advantage of every proc.

</div>Hello Qaenyin<br>
<br>
Do some reading up on tanking in ICC (you did mention that was where you wanted to tank).  The current end game tanking priority is EH, or effective health - not avoidance.  ICC has a permanent (while you are in the instance) -20% to Dodge.  This completely nerfs the stacking of avoidance in end game raiding (notice I did NOT say completely <i>negates </i>avoidance), which was Blizzard's intent as they gear up for Cataclysm.  A quick quote from GhostCrawler:<br>
<i>"What I would like to see in Cataclysm is higher health pools but also lower heals (and tank avoidance) overall. "</i><br>
<br>
Therefore, we would now want to stack effective health (health, armor) to maximize survivability in the Citadel. In the very first boss encounter for example, you are going to be consistently taking around 18 to 22K damage every 2 seconds (others can check my figures as I am tired  ;P) and that is as off-tank .  MT will also be taking melee hits.  You must have over 40K on this encounter or it basically puts your healers in a no win situation.  This is how it is meant to be...a gear check.  <br>
<br>
We have done this with a tank with 44K but it took multiple tries, however I am sure some guilds are able to push through.  To one shot that particular encounter I usually tank with a little over 50K, and the druid tank with about 55.7K.<br>

</div>I don't understand the, what I consider to be a misconception, idea of "needing" Death Strike healing while in a raid.  Your healers are there for a purpose, and you are there for a different purpose.  Healing yourself while in a 5 man is indeed neat, but in no way needed in a raid scenario.  Ask your healers if they can tell the difference between your Blood tanking (using the proper rotation/priority) and some other tank.  Your survival on something like the previous fight (Marrowgar) will not be affected at all by a DS heal.<br>

ICC has a permanent (while you are in the instance) -20% to Dodge.  This completely nerfs the stacking of avoidance in end game raiding (notice I did NOT say completely <i>negates </i>avoidance), which was Blizzard's intent as they gear up for Cataclysm.  A quick quote from GhostCrawler:<br>
<i>"What I would like to see in Cataclysm is higher health pools but also lower heals (and tank avoidance) overall. "</i><br>
<br>
Therefore, we would now want to stack effective health (health, armor) to maximize survivability in the Citadel. In the very first boss encounter for example, you are going to be consistently taking around 18 to 22K damage every 2 seconds (others can check my figures as I am tired  ;P) and that is as off-tank .  MT will also be taking melee hits.  You must have over 40K on this encounter or it basically puts your healers in a no win situation.  This is how it is meant to be...a gear check.  <br>
<br>
We have done this with a tank with 44K but it took multiple tries, however I am sure some guilds are able to push through.  To one shot that particular encounter I usually tank with a little over 50K, and the druid tank with about 55.7K.<br>
<br>
<br>
I don't understand the, what I consider to be a misconception, idea of "needing" Death Strike healing while in a raid.  Your healers are there for a purpose, and you are there for a different purpose.  Healing yourself while in a 5 man is indeed neat, but in no way needed in a raid scenario.  Ask your healers if they can tell the difference between your Blood tanking (using the proper rotation/priority) and some other tank.  Your survival on something like the previous fight (Marrowgar) will not be affected at all by a DS heal.<br>
<br>
<br>
Your pally friend is mostly likely counting his block in with dodge and parry, just like most pallies do.  It took 30 minutes the other day for my party to explain to our pug tank that his avoidance wasn't 75%.  Shoot a armory link this way and we can tell, I guess.<br>

Covering each point seperately.<br>
<br>
First point, yes I realize EH is more important than avoidance, which is why I'm aiming for the pretty low level of 65-70% avoidance(considering my present avoidance is almost 60% and my equipment is 15-30 ilvs below even ToC25 gear, that puts it as pretty mediocre for unbuffed.  65% avoidance, discounting spec specific talents like FDP, would be along the lines of 12% miss, 32% dodge and 21% parry, which is only 8% higher than what I presently have.  I'm not taking Chill of the Throne into account in my numbers, mind, for the sake of simplicity).  If I were stacking avoidance I'd want closer to 75%+.  That said, I need a certain level of avoidance to maintain rune strike uptime.  The avoidance level I want has little to do with survivability.<br>
<br>
38k hp is pretty low, yes, which is why I'm trying to get a reasonable number to aim for.  I only have about 33.5k right now unbuffed, but I cannot seem to come up with a decent gearset I can obtain for ICC that will bring me up to the 40-45k unbuffed that I'd prefer to have.  Even throwing in the ICC trinket and every piece of ToC25 crafted gear and every piece of badge gear sans frost badges only seems to put me at 38-39k with full +30 stamina gems.<br>
<br>
Reason I like having death strike available is more for padding to support my healers than for the sake of a primary source of healing.  Being able to grab a quick 12k heal via death strike is a pretty significant benefit if it won't noticably impact threat generation at the time, and while not something I want to rely on, is something I find frequently convenient enough to be a nice thing to have if I can work it in in a pinch during a high damage intake situation(I ended up using it a lot in uld10 back in 3.1 as blood as it made a pretty sizeable difference on hodir, giving my healers more freedom to top off dps taking incidental aoe damage, and I have on several occasions had it allow me to survive long enough to serve as a buffer between heals in certain situations).<br>
<br>
And lastly, the paladin in question in the gearset I was describing has 44k unbuffed hp, roughly 3k block value, and 70%+ avoidance(this is his anub add tanking set and thus he makes it a point to be avoidance capped with holy shield, which would be at least 68% avoidance minimum, and he has more than that I know for sure).<br>
<br>
That's partly why I'm still using my T8.5 chest.  I'm undecided on whether it will be necessary for me to get Breastplate of the White Knight and Saronite Swordbreakers made or if my current bracers and the T9 chest will be sufficient, so I haven't spent my triumph badges yet in case I need them for the orbs.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>No, you really don't. Most tanks are at a comfortable level of avoidance to maintain Runestrike, and if not, then they shouldn't be endgame.  I can't think of a single ICC fight where your DPS would overtake you on threat, except on something like an aggro wipe, which they should know how to handle anyway.<br>
Runestrike just got a buff in 3.3 to offset the -20% dodge.<br>
<br>
The most return you will see for Runstrike uptime if you have a good level of avoidance is capping Hit.  You are very near cap, which is great...I am only at 6% I believe and i have no problems at all.<br>
<br>
Your expertise is probably the next thing to improve to minimize your other TPS abilities from getting avoided.  You will see threat jump a significant amount the closer to cap you get.<br>
<br>
There is no reason not to have an avoidance set, since there are some fights which demand it at first (until its on farm) such as Saurfang.  This will NOT be the norm, bceause of Blizz's direction for tanking.<br>
However every other fight you will need your EH set, and an EH set doesn't gem for avoidance.<br>
If you look at my armory now, thats my avoidance set.  All i did was swap out trinkets.  Thats it.  And it was way overboard for Saurfang.  Next time i won't even switch from my EH set on that fight.<br>
<br>
I am not trying to make you uncomfortable while playing...obviously you need to be happy with your toon.  But these forums are all about maximizing, and doing things because a <i>better </i>option doesn't exist.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Keep in mind most of you SS's are going to do less damage if you out 1 whole disease.  But some of the builds are based partly on T9 set bonuses and T10.  Reaping helps when get the t10 2 set with the bonus and extra SS w/ reaping.  <br>
<br>
I would remove if you insist on OaPH 2 from Necrosis and maybe 1 out of BCB.  But the worst thing is to have diseases fall off so loosing one in Epidemic makes your rotation even tighter.  With Epidemic lets me get a SS-BS-DC or 2 in on the next target without re-applying everything.  <br>
<br>
Even in 5mans as gear score goes up you get into better dps groups where you will be lucky to get off 4 attacks before most everything is dead. <br>
<br>
If you are looking for just mount speed ok, but if you are looking for increased run speed there is a boot enchant that helps out.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Unless something has changed, Necrosis doesn't take modifiers from anything else anymore. Purely based on your white damage.<br>
<br>
BCB is more damage, but only if it procs with your diseases up, of course. If you're going to be AOE farming I'd say it's not huge either way. Those are both single target talents and I doubt you'd see a significant difference in kill time with one over the other, though BCB will probably still be more damage.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">In regards to Runic Power and Unholy DPS, should I always be using Death Coil in the middle of my rotation if the next strike will bring me over the RP cap? For instance, I go into combat with 60/100 RP, do PS-IT-BS- which would put me at 95/100 RP, would using Death Coil then and continuing with BS-SS-DUMP be the best idea? I usually try my best to not RP cap myself.</div>

</div>(Boss) PS-IT-BS- next hit SS (should be 100/100 RP) hope it proc's trinket/pop trinkets and use Gargoyle(60 RP), BS should give little extra RP to hit your DC(40 RP) should have enough RP to continue with your normal rotation.  If fight lasts longer then 3min then you will have a chance for a 2nd Gargoyle attack.  <br>
<br>
(Trash) same as above but would judge using Gargoyle on how close you are to the boss encounter, DC Dump is a good option as well.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1508487"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Just a quick question. I'm on the fence right now about what spec to use for DPS on my DK. I'm debating different spec's to compensate for raid make-up, weapon choices, current gear, playability, as well as how much i enjoy playing the different spec's... What i can't quite wrap my head around (mostly because rawr is so fidgity) is the current "best to worst" list....<br>
<br>
The way i have it in my head right now is: Unholy is AOE king but a bit behind on the single target, DW forst sits middle of the road (with the hardest rotation, which i like), and blood pulls ahead as the single target champ... Not looking to flare up any debates, but is this a good "rough" way of describing the spec's as we stand going into ICC?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>5 man dps is largely irrelevent.  If things are dying, and you aren't afk, then you are doing your job.  As a DK I hold top 5 spots as unholy and frost in all current 10m fights and top 25 spots in all current 25m fights (minus Anub I believe), I put out 10k+ dps on Saurfang, but on some fights in heroics with my guild I only put out 2-2.5k (now if it's 3gcd or longer, that changes, but honestly a lot of mobs, even bosses, die before I can complete the second half of my rotation).<br>
<br>
DK dps has a ramp up time that other classes don't, in order to anything remotely decent you need diseases up, and the only way to speed that process is to dps in unholy presence (and if things are dying in 3s, it's most likely going to be giving you more dps anyways) or spec frost for more instant burst at the start of a fight (and higher melee damage which doesn't require 2-3 seconds of disease application / spreading time - as well as HB for instant burst on AoE packs).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Glyph of Blood Strike does 20% extra damage to snared targets.<br>

What I'm wondering is to the math behind the extra 20% damage on Glyph of Blood Strike.  Does it add in the 20% to the 40% weapon damage or to the overall damage of Blood Strike.  <br>

I just got a battered hilt from pit of Saron  - Just wanted to know which of the 2hander swords to get, considering that my main goal in the game is to pvp.<br>
<br>
I'm looking at maxdps and its telling me that the strength weapon is supierior to the agility (eg Might of the Faithful &gt; Quel'Delar, Ferocity of the Scorned) for dps.<br>

Is this the case for pvp also? Are there things that I'm not considering (more than likely).<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I have been attempting to search for this information but apparently I am having no luck.  A friend of mine obtained a Deathbringer's Will on his DK which he typically plays as Blood.  I read in the Frost DW thread that the procs for a DK are Haste, Crit and Str.  However, my friend (Ahi of Laughing Skull) states that as Blood he was getting two different Iron Dwarves, one with a crit proc and the other with an Arp proc and then he'd get a Tauren with a Str proc.<br>
<br>
We were curious so he respec'd to Unholy and Frost.  The following are the results from all three specs.<br>
<br>
Unholy - Crit, Str, Haste<br>
Blood - Crit, Str, Arp<br>
Frost - Crit, Str, Arp<br>
<br>
My question is has anybody else discovered this yet and could anybody else help verify it?</div>

I have an update on this.  Mysteriously, a change was made between last night and today that now has Blood DK's proc'ing the Haste Valk instead of ArP.<br>
<br>
Blizzard developers did mention in a forum post that they were going to change the proc on the Deathbringer's Will to be optimized for every spec that could use the trinket.  However, I do believe they are in error with this particular change.<br>

I just figured I'd update this since it may effect more people now.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
On my DK I constantly run into problems where I'd like to pop a cooldown, but don't have any runes.  My previous attempts to macro blood tap with the cooldown have been unsuccessful (I play with a relatively high latency for a tank (~200ms).<br>
<br>
Is there anything I can do within my macros to add a very brief delay into the macro itself to compensate for latency?  I often find myself either hitting my hotkey for blood tap -&gt; unbreakable armor, but that it does not fire, and i have been gibbed (I'm looking at YOU, saber lash!).<br>
<br>
I've tried a bunch of stuff, but nothing seems to work.  Any advice is greatly appreciated!<br>

</div>I would suggest a castsequence macro if you're not using one.<br>
<br>
#showtooltip<br>
/castsequence reset=30 Blood Tap, Unbreakable Armor<br>
<br>
They're nice because spell #2 won't fire if spell #1 doesn't successfully cast, so you can mash the crap out of the macro button and you'll get Blood Tap then UA without having to hit multiple buttons.<br>
<br>
The bad thing is you won't get UA if your Blood Tap is on cooldown. I suggest using this macro in your normal spot for Blood Tap, since with the reset you can use it as a normal blood tap button by just pressing it once, and keep UA bound seperately for situations where tap is on cooldown and you have the capability of casting it without tapping. This is just a "oh crap I need UA and have no runes mash mash mash" type of macro.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I noticed one thing while doing this. DRW is supposed to do 50% of your damage, which it did with melee attacks, but my DRW strikes were hitting for roughly 25% of my DKs. I tested it out naked on the level 80 training dummy and in an instance.<br>

Has it always been like this or is this a stealth nerf, and if it's always been like this, what's the reasoning for that? (I'd guess PVP reasoning personally)<br>

DRW does not get your talents and Blood Presence that adds to your attacks.  Also if you cast a disease after DRW the strikes will be bigger.  If they are messing with Blood's damage, it will not be down (Blood is at the bottom, but someone has to be there).

</div>The debuff mechanic is a bit odd. I'm not sure what gargoyle does as I don't play unholy, but here goes.<br>
<br>
You now need to target someone to cast DRW (99% sure about this), and they get a DRW debuff, and you simultaneously get a DRW buff. It'll still be next to you, but it'll attack them straight away.<br>
<br>
If the target dies before DRW fades, it'll continue acting like it used to, return to your side, do what you do, but the difference is that it'll stick to its old target until the target is dead or it fades.<br>
<br>
This have ups and downs I guess. One up is that it won't randomly aggro some healer casting stuff and stay on the target you want, a downside is that the debuff will really stick out and announce incoming burst, and switches won't work as well. (PVP ups and downs). As far as PVE goes, it probably doesn't make that much of a difference.<br>
<br>
As far as the damage goes.<br>
<br>
I can't imagine what talents are the ones that make DRW only do 25% damage of your strikes, and still do 50% melee damage compared to your melee swings, but after checking out combat logs, it seems to have been like this since before. For how long, I'm not sure.<br>
<br>
For instance:<br>

Combat Date 2009-12-16<br>
<br>
HS Average: 6,198<br>
DRW HS Average: 2,079 (Probably popped every cooldown to make it to 1/3 of his Average, rather than 1/4, what most other logs show)<br>
<br>

DRW Melee Average: 3,392<br>
<br>
DS Average: 10,317<br>
DRW DS Average: 1,758<br>
<br>
I can understand that raid buffs and procs could make a difference between your damage and DRWs, but like I said, hitting the dummy naked still gives the same results.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1520207"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I tried searching the forum for a concrete answer, but with the Unholy DK having over 2000 replies alone, searching through that topic would be insane, wasting time and possible giving me a headache, so instead I'll resort it this way.<br>
<br>
I need to know what Unholy DK's need to do during the first phase whilst fighting Lady Deathwhisper. I googled, but surprisingly I could not find a concrete answer.<br>
<br>
The reason I am asking is because Unholy DK deal damage in 2 ways, physical and magical, as I am sure you guys are aware. Now, when people talk about the tactics, you always hear people say "melee attack x" and "range attack y", or "physical attack x" and "magical attack y".<br>
However, the problem, to which I have not found a solution yet, be it simple or not, is that I don't see where Unholy DKs fit into this, as Scourge Strike and Icy Touch are spells for example and Blood Strike and Plague Strike are physical and those are the abilities we use most.<br>
So what is the best solution for Unholy DKs in P1 in 10 and 25 man? Do we just soak it and have half of our attacks absorbed 99%? Do we attack Deathwhisper instead? I am not sure in either way. To me, it would make sense to attack Lady Deathwhisper, as we could deal more damage that way than on mobs that have half of our attacks deal 1% of its normal power.<br>
<br>
Thanks in advance.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1520965"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I have been hesitant to post this because of its non-confirmed, only observed status.<br>
<br>
I started noticing DnD doing alot less threat about a week or more ago.  Generally, before this, I could AoE pull in heroics and both 10 and 25s with DnD&gt;IT&gt;PS&gt;Pest and go into a lazy tabbing-thru-targets rotation until I had to use DnD again if needed.<br>
This was plenty of threat by a long-shot.<br>
Suddenly, I started having mobs walking THROUGH my DnD to get to people, and this would even happen on the pull.  Once people started asking where my threat went (I have never had threat problems) I began to watch Omen.<br>
<br>
Sure enough, on a standard run in and drop DnD AoE pull in all dungeons (Hs,10s &amp; 25s), I did some testing with a healer.  Getting to 100K threat in a heroic using <b>only </b> a DnD&gt;IT&gt;PS&gt;Pest rotation used to be about 20 seconds.<br>
However, when I tested I never made it.  Or rather, I gave up and started tabbing targets.  It was common for a mob to run out to the healer. I have ThreatNamePlates so I could watch them and the threat I had on that mob.  It was very common for the mob to have only 2K threat on it.  As a matter of fact, using only DnD WITH THE GLYPH never changed this.  Still only about 2K threat on the untargeted mobs.  I am still using the Glyph right now mostly because I am just hoping it works, even though I see no improvement. <br>
<br>
TPS in raids was the same.  I had mobs walk out of DnD with hardly any threat of them (still using Glyph).  Several people including my wife (the healer) now have witnessed the phenomenon and simply chalk it up to the 'DKs are all nerfed now' mentality.  I don't believe that, and have seen nobody else experiencing this, nor any mention of a stealth nerf to DK AoE threat.<br>
<br>
This is very frustrating, and I assure you it is not something that has been there all along and that I am just now seeing, I have been tanking this toon a long while now.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
As you can see in that report my diseases had nearly the same amount of ticks (58 vs 54), and my tick on my primary target (Fjora Lightbane) did an average of 2877 damage, where my average tick on the other Val'kyr (Eydis Darkbane) averaged 922 damage per tick.<br>
<br>
The buff, Dark Essence in my case, reduces your damage done to the other color Val'kyr by 50% (and it's always worked that way), and judging from my Patchwerk parse (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100324002926/http://worldoflogs.com/reports/v1b7spu0j78y5mcl/spell/55095/?s=649&amp;e=726" target="_blank">World of Logs - Real Time Raid Analysis</a>) my average tick was just under 1800, so that fits.  The bonus damage against your primary target is 50%, which also fits within slight variation with the above (ie 2877 vs 2700, small sample size, etc.).<br>
<br>
It is still working now as it was a few weeks ago.<br>
<br>
Edit: Those numbers are accurate, I did not change colors on vortex and I did not gain Empowered Darkness as a dps buff, that is strictly me vs valks.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

There was a major red flag for me merely because we did not obliterate all other DPS that week, our overall disease damage was decreased by at least 20%, and the other DK, who uses the Unholy AoE spec and generally tops the meters by far was 10th that week. (And no, he didn't die.)<br>

</div>I'm not sure what I was thinking when I read your post then, sorry about that (may have been chatting in IRC about valks and it just popped into my head for the reply).<br>
<br>
This week (not this reset, last reset) my average FF tick was 1572.1, where 2 weeks ago my average FF tick was 1631.63, so it doesn't appear there has been any major nerfs, and RNG can easily decide that small of a difference, or enemies stacking, group debuffs, etc.<br>
<br>
If you look at the damage breakdown the diseases weren't up on as many targets as the previous week, which is a cause for a major dps loss.  Also, if you look at his buffs cast (speaking about Karashoté atm) he applied diseases a total of 249 times on the first parse and only 80 times on the second parse (Ebon Plague was 376 vs 114 as well, to show the drastic change).  The other DK seems to have a fairly similar parse between both weeks, with just standard deviation from the norm, so I wouldn't worry much about it.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Just by looking at the report, Haste has nothing to do with your poor performance. Your glyphs choice(D&amp;d, God) is not good for this fight. You have GoD but you use PS/IT 7 time in the fight, you must be doing something wrong. Due to your mistakes in your cycle you are making less SS than expected resulting a dps loss.</div>

</div>I'm trying to ween myself off of using pestilence to refresh diseases.  I know that is an issue.  My main concern is melee damage.  Isn't that simply auto attack?   We were both using dual-blade at the time, but yet the other DK got 11 more melee swings in then me.<br>
<br>
That's why I was wondering about the extreme haste difference.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
With 4p T9 I'm at 37 expertise (ew) 196 ArP, with Thunderous Rampage I'm at 28 expertise 20% ArP. I imagine I'll put out higher numbers with the extra ArP but I don't know the value of the 4pc T9. <br>

I figure my trinket is my biggest problem ( Vengeance of the Forsaken ) Once I replace that I can switch to 9.5 and sit at 27 expertise. But that is neither here, nor there. <br>

In the ideal Blood tanking rotations for Multi-Tanking Rotation it says:<br>
     "Multi Target Rotation - DnD-IT-PS-Pest then TAB-HS/DS/Pest/BloodBoil RPDUMP = RS/Deathcoil"<br>
Question - what does the "TAB-HS" stand for?  I presume the HS is Heart Strike but can't figure out the "TAB" portion.<br>

Same thing for Frost Multi Target Rotation - it lists TAB-HB.  The HB is presumably Howling Blast but what is the "TAB" spell/ability?<br>

</div>Redcape and I (both support Ret Paladin tools) have done some extensive research and found that on average 19% of the fight takes place under the 20% mark.  Execute increases aren't as large a change as most people expect.<br>
<br>
If your execute begins at 35%, I'd expect 33% of the fight occurs under that level.  Saying 25% of the fight is under 35% total health means raid damage climbs to 140% at that stage - it just doesn't happen.  Execute effects are about a 5% increase.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1530545"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Been looking around for a while, and wondered if anyone would be able to help me with something. Before I played WoW, I played Everquest, and a tank on there too, although a Warrior. In EQ, we used to weight gear choices through a system of X HP = X AC, and then factor in mod2's in the choices (avoidance, spell sheild etc).<br>
<br>
In WoW however, I'm having a much harder time figuring out where the balance lies between avoidance and health (which seem to be the two swing points as far as I can see). I've been tending to gear for +defense +dodge where I can, but I see a lot of threads where people state that gearing for +stamina is what you should do as a tank.<br>
<br>
Given that AC over HP used to be the most viable tanking ideal in Everquest, I guess I'm just curious if it's also viable here. Can you gear, gem and enchant for avoidance, and still be a decent tank? Or does it require at least some deference to hitpoints?<br>
<br>
For reference, I'm tanking Heroics up to and including Saron, but haven't tried my hand at raids yet, since I don't really know much about how they work, and I'm Unholy specced.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

You are probably correct. For any fight that involves movement, the token is worse. (And those are every ICC fight except Saurfang and Festergut.) Also, you have yet to spend lots of badges on T10 pieces and (maybe) belt.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1533856"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->As a single-disease frost tank I'm considering dropping Chill of the Grave and Unbreakable Armor in favour of Acclimation. I very rarely use FS when tanking, and often find my RP overflowing with both CotG and 2/3 SoB. I practically never have enough of a threat issue to make FS a useful investment of my RP.<br>
<br>
The main reason I'm a little sceptical about Acclimation is that I'm not entirely convinced it's a useful buff. I assume it stacks with element-specific resistances (totems/auras) as it'd be a quite pointless 3 points otherwise. The main concern I have is whether there's enough magic damage that is (even in part) mitigatable by resistance. A large number of spells during Festergut, and probably even the oozes/floods in Rotface make it's uptime quite likely to be good but will my having resistance actually mitigate some incoming damage?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1534157"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I was planning on making a post in Suno's thread about Acclimation yesterday stating where it was useful and what spells would activate the buff, unfortunately my /combatlog for wednesday night was scuppered by an untimely disconnect halfway through Lana'Thel tries missing out most of the Plagueworks. So i'll have to put up a log as evidence after next reset, however in the meantime i'll try to list what I've eyeballed causing the proc and actually how useful it is for the fights that matter.<br>
<br>
Festergut - Can proc off of both of the blights spread into the room as well the shadow damage from the innoculation, however uptime can be unpredictable so its not something you can rely on being up for when the Pungent Blight hits home.<br>
<br>
Rotface - Seems to proc off of both of the ooze auras and the slime spray, uncertain as to whether the slime pools can cause it to proc. All damage taken is Shadowstorm, which lists as shadow damage in the combat log and will give you shadow buff stacks which do seem to decrease the damage taken so whether its just a cosmetic school name change or something else is supposed to be going on I'm not sure. Uptime if you're the ooze kiter is high and very useful, if you're usually tanking Rotface himself however I can't see it being much use at all.<br>
<br>
Putricide - Unfortunately I've been the Abom tank each time on this fight so the only phase I can comment on is P3, the debuff that stacks on the tank and deals raidwide damage will proc the shadow stacks with high uptime, however its not usually the damage the tanks are taking from the debuff that's the worry in this part of the fight.<br>
<br>
Blood Council - Procs from both of Keleseth and Taldaram's spells. If you're running the 2 tank strategy and you happen to be picking up Keleseth the buff will be up at full 3 stacks pretty much constantly as the shadow dot from the Nuclei will also prop up the buff, its very nice here. Taldaram's spells tend to be a bit further spaced apart so you stand a chance of losing your stacks, however it will proc off of both the spheres and the sparks.<br>
<br>
Lana'Thel - This one is the daddy, your stack will be up almost constantly from her aura. Her bloodbolts, aura, and flames(if you happen to have bad melee dps) will all proc your shadow stacks. The bad news is that the shadow damage from Blood Mirror does not seem to be resistable(however you can absorb it with AMS). Still you'll get a good chunk of damage reduction for most of the fight.<br>
<br>
The Rest - Coldflame from Marrowgar, Stinkey's Nature Pulse, Mortar Explosions from Gunship, Saurfang's debuffs(proc shadow resistance for some wierd reason) and pretty much all of the spells from Deathwhisper will give you Acclimation stacks, not that you'll care though.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Stick to your rotation, if you are finding that you have a couple of seconds before your diseases fall off, that is less than 2 seconds or so, and your other runes have 5 or more seconds to become active it would be beneficial to reapply the diseases if you are following the rotation for the build. If that is not the case an extra SS then a quick reapplication of your diseases will help you overall. However, remember that if your locks aren't CoEing for that fight and the raid's magic damage is solely relying on your Ebon Plague then you should reapply unless raid dps is not a problem.<br>
<br>
As to your second question, unless you get your 2pT10, don't break your 4pT9 bonus, even then when you get 2pT10 you would keep the other two pieces of T9 to get the 180 str proc. So, in short, get the 2pT10 because you will eventually go to 4pT10 maybe even 5. So do what is best for you.<br>

		<div id="post_message_1539063"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I think even for 2h the expertise would be superior since you can get the hit bonus with any other Draenei in your group without being one yourself. The main reason why I'd consider the human and dwarven racial useless for 2h PvE is that all the strong 2h weapons are axes so the human/dwarven expertise racial is completely wasted. With the practical expertise gain as human being 0 as soon as you get your hands on good weapons you might as well go Draenei and make sure you always have the hit increase. The orcish one on the other hand fits the current BiS items perfectly.<br>
It's different for DW since as far as I know the BiS weapons there are swords which means the human racial works.<br>
<br>
I also got a question:<br>
When channeling AotD a DK will take reduced damage equal to his dodge and parry chance. Generally when casting a spell one loses the ability to dodge and parry. Does this mean that the loss of dodge/parry due to casting is just compensated, resulting in the same overall damage taken (though less spiky) during the channel or is the AotD cast special (which is a fair assumption since there is also no pushback and DK spells generally don't work like caster spells) and dodge/parry while channeling it are still possible, making it a "real" defensive cooldown?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>If you are fine with threat, then what is the point of your guildie? If it works, don't fix it <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100207105306im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":)" class="inlineimg"><br>
<br>
I'm also frost and use HB glyph. For trash I open with D&amp;D-HB-BB or HB-BB-BB if D&amp;D is on CD. If it's not ICC trash, then it's probably dead at that point or close to it. If not, then I try to PS-Pest but anyway I prefer HB-BB to IT-PS-Pest. For me it works way better when dpsers choose different targets.<br>

</div>Army is a tricky thing to use, it burns 3 runes and has a long cast time.<br>
<br>
1)  I usually cast army on the pull, you have the time to cast and minimize the risk of a dps loss (if the army dies early).  On fights such as saurfang, you won't run the risk of adds being taunted by army.  If you're going to cast it mid-fight, I would recommend using ERW to minimize impact on your rotation.<br>
<br>
2)  Army is a dps gain in most cases.  Bear in mind, the army needs to live the full duration.<br>
<br>
3)  If you're casting pre-pull, no potions need to be taken.  However, if you're pre-potting (such as the armor pot), then pop the potion first.  If you're casting mid-fight, then yes just like the ghoul, gargolye, DRW, the armies stats are based on yours at cast time definitely pot before the cast.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

2)  Army is a dps gain in most cases.  Bear in mind, the army needs to live the full duration.<br>
<br>
Something to add to this, It gains significantly more DPS by using it after a Heroism or Bloodlust is cast in the raid, and by using a haste potion and any on use trinkets should be used prior to casting it as well. This applies to Summon Gargoyle as well for Unholy DK's I am not sure about DRW for blood but I can guess that it does, though i may be way off on that, I don't play Blood nor will I ever do so, so I have no idea.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Question about Frost tanking.<br>
<br>
Shadai states in his DK guide that Frost use this rotation to aoe tank: HB&gt;BB&gt;BB (or D&amp;D instead of last BB).  His single target rotation is: HB&gt;OB&gt;BS and so on.  This rotation ignores applying Blood Plague.<br>
<br>
Suno's DK guide shows aoe as follows: DnD-IT-PS-Pest then TAB-HB/Pest/BloodBoil.  Single target: IT-PS-OB-BS-BS IT-PS-OB-OB<br>
<br>
I follow Shadai's method (and have HB glyph), and do fine for threat, but a guildy has been arguing that Suno's rotation is correct and im wrong.  Im just wondering if one rotation is wrong and the other is right, or if both can be used effectively.  Im also wondering how much better Frost threat could even be applying both diseases instead of just Frost Fever.</div>

	</tbody></table>
</div>The other poster is correct, discussing which is "correct" is academic. There is no absolute in tanking terms, merely enough. I find it much more critical to decide whether you need immediate and high AoE TPS or you can deal with slightly lower, higher overall TPS.<br>
<br>
DnD is great for threat, but generally not worth much in front-load. If your AoE is over-eager it may result in a few stray mobs; For this reason I suggest HB-BB-BB-BT-DnD personally. Adding BP and spreading with Pestilence is two GCDs worth of time, which will start adding 350 or so damage to your threat on every mob about 5sec into the pull. Hardly worth bothering. FF isn't so much a threat tool as it is an attack-speed debuff and a method to increase the size of BB (remember BB only needs 1 disease to do it's max dmg).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1542241"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I've noticed in the Unholy thread some folks mentioning they are spreading ebon plague on the blood beasts that Saurfang spawns.  Obviously that would help the caster dps.

		<div id="post_message_1542267"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->If you can get your rotation to line up properly, then yes it's a good idea to pest when the adds spawn. It will increase raid dps and your own dps as well. Just taking a quick look at my last Saurfang parse shows 50k damage on the beasts over 5 waves, which is about 10k dmg for each pestilence and I didn't even do that well since I was doing it 3-4 seconds late. Still, it's more damage than a single blood strike.<br>
<br>
As for threat concerns, this may depend on what your raid is doing when they spawn, but so far I've never had them turn on me.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Also note that while defence lowers in value the further past the cap you go, it still is usable avoidance, and until the Miss Cap it's pretty solid usable avoidance. Both runewords are immune to dininishing returns, however, so if you're def-capped by not much, you'll still have excellent return on your defence with NC.<br>

SB will increase your RS uptime, as all 4% are parry, while only 2% of the avoidance granted by NC can proc RS.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Why even number seems to delay Disease tick? <br>
First possible reason: Uneven number are when the adds pop. That would means that diseases are not delayed when they are spread to another targets. <u>But</u> when I have made the first pestilence, there was no add but disease ticks without any delay.<br>
Second possible reason: There is a strange behavior on GoD code on Blizzard server that delay disease half the time.<br>

		<div id="post_message_1545537"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Interesting observation there.<br>
Does the timing recover properly? or does it delay the whole cycle?  I'd be curious to see the frost fever ticks as well?<br>
Looking at your worldoflogs, the delays are pretty random.  The first 4 refreshes don't delay frost fever, but the 5th does, while it leaves blood plague alone.  It's hard to tell, but it appears that if you cast pest within a short period of the tick, then the next tick is delayed.  Maybe it sets the next tick to occur 3 seconds after the pest effect.<br>
<br>
That matches up pretty well with your pattern.<br>
<br>
The pattern actually looks a lot like the one I saw when I was flipping diseases, where I was amazed that with my latency I pretty much always got the correct number of ticks.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Is turning off gnaw increasing your DPS on a regular bossfight? As it would use energy that would've been a Claw? That's the only logic I find, but I can't find any posts about it. It's most likely a tiny upgrade but so easy to make it still shouldn't be ignored. Am I right?</div>

		<div id="post_message_1546200"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I assume you're using a non-English client, as there is no Improved Stolen Heat. What I suspect you mean is Improved Icy Touch, which grants 20% melee haste to the raid.<br>
<br>
The haste given by IIT does not stack with (improved) Windfurry Totem. However, a Frost DK doesn't offer any other buffs. the 10% AP from (shaman) Unleashed Rage can only be given by a Blood DK or a Marksman Hunter. It is not possible to give both IIT (20% melee haste) and Abomination's Rage (10% AP) as a DK with the same spec. Is a Frost DK a replacement for an Enh Shaman? No, he's a replacement for a Windfurry Totem.<br>
<br>
There is currently no such thing as Unholy DW spec. No UH specs that are viable in any way with two 1h weapons since 3.3.0.<br>
<br>
There is currently no reason to ever have a Frost DK in a raid unless you don't have that 20% melee haste. Frost is so far behind Unholy it's only a benefit if it provides the raid buff.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>A frost DK is a valid replacement for the Windfury totem, though as previously mentioned, they do not provide the 10% AP that some other classes can. For the most part, the gear for Frost and Unholy will be similar enough that if you are lacking that melee haste buff, the raid dps increase will be more then the DK's personal DPS loss. The reason that every Frost Spec has Improved Icy Talons is because Frost DPS &lt; Unholy DPS in almost every situation, so there is no reason to spec Frost if you aren't providing 20% melee haste.<br>
<br>
@Pint, I think he is asking about any significant gearing changes going Unholy &gt; Frost, not if DW Unholy is viable.<br>
<br>
@Chizzle, Expertise cap isn't that important for Unholy because of how loose the rotation is on GCDs.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

It was a no brainer for me to replace 2 pieces of tier 9, as they were only i232. I have been reading some arguments on here saying that simply having the 2 piece set bonus and using the reaping build will net a higher dps, where others say you need several pieces of ICC gear as well and possibly an ICC25 or equivalent weapon. I cannot seem to find a definitive answer.<br>
<br>
Just wondering if anyone could shed a bit more light on this? I have a few ICC 10 man pieces but don't know if it's enough to warrant changing and sticking to a reaping build yet. Should I wait for more ICC gear?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>As a DPS, you won't find it very useful at all. The only times I'll use it during a fight is if I mess up my rotation and go way off, or if I, for some reason, pop AotD in combat instead of before the fight start. Using AotD messes up all your runes and wastes a lot of them. Using ERW right after the channeling time is over, you'll not miss out on too much (4 seconds of DPSing), and most likely benefit a lot more from it than if you didn't.<br>
<br>
If you're a tank, you'll probably find it useful in situations where you NEED runes but don't have any.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>For Unholy DPS it's usually best to use it right after the first cycle and Summon Gargoyle, your first rotation becomes IT-PS-BS-BT/SS-SS-Gargoyle-ERW-SS-SS-BS-BS. The reason to use it as DPS at all is that for Unholy your damage per Global CD is higher for rune abilities than for runic power abilities (with the exception of Summon Gargoyle), so if you use ERW right at the start you'll be able to use it again at the 5:15 minute mark (assuming the fight lasts that long). That way you shift your damage composition a bit from runic power abilities to higher-dps rune abilities.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1551411"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->As a tank, I find it most useful when you're low on threat, mostly at a pull. It's also fairly useful if you're coming up to a phase where you'll be needing RP and know you won't have enough (perhaps you need enough to make sure you can both AMS and counter, like tanking Lady). Though it's more useful as Frost tank, as you use up runes two-by-two.<br>
<br>
As a Blood tank it's only use so far that I've seen is if you're low on health and you could use two Death Strikes within the next 3sec. That, or if you pull with DnD-IT-PS-HS and want to frontload a lot of threat.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1552239"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Hi there. So I was fooling around with my meta gems on Rawr (I'm blood dps), and I noticed rawr suggested using different meta gems than the BiS thread/blood simple on here...<br>
<br>
Rawr seemed to think Thundering Skyflare Diamond was 13 dps more than Relentless Earthsiege Diamond, and that. Chaotic Skyflare Diamond was 4 dps more than Relentless Earthsiege Diamond... I see Chaotic Skyflare Diamond requires 2 blue gems, and that except for just a couple pieces of gear, using a 10 str /15 stam purple gem (as well as a +10 stats) to fulfill reqs usually lowers your dps by about as much as the chaotic boosts it, due to the loss of 10 str. However, Thundering Skyflare Diamond has the same reqs as Relentless Earthsiege Diamond (1 red 1 yellow 1 blue), so it would be easily met (like relentless) with a +10 stats nightmare's tear...<br>
<br>
For those unfamiliar with Thundering Skyflare Diamond, the gem says it has a chance to increase melee/ranged haste rating. Looking a little deeper on wowhead, it appears to increase melee/ranged haste rating by 480 for 6 seconds, has a 100% proc (couldn't quite figure out if this is 100% on white melee, or if heart strike etc. will proc, spells apparently do not.) with either a 45 or 60 second ICD.<br>
<br>
I realize it's only 13 dps, but there doesn't seem to be any major reason not to use it (I realize haste isn't a great stat, and that the +3% crit damage is nice, but rawr usually seems to be correct), and in fact it is actually a little cheaper than Relentless Earthsiege Diamond on my server.<br>
<br>
Opinions? Is Thundering Skyflare Diamond better or worse than Relentless Earthsiege Diamond? Lots of haste vs. a small amount of crit and a nice 3% crit damage boost?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I've read through a couple of threads and come to the conclusion about Glyph of Disease (GoD) below.<br>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li>Against 1 target, GoD does not refresh Improved Icy Talons (IIT), Tundra Stalker (TS), and Rage of Rivendare (RoR) effects.</li>
<li>Against 1+ targets, GoD refreshes IIT, TS, and RoR effects.</li>
<li>Because GoD refreshes disease durations, Ebon Plaguebringer (EP) is refreshed in either situation.</li>
</ol><br>
Is the above summary correct?<br>
<br>
Many thanks in advance<br>

</div>Do you mean refresh with PS or will a GoD Pestilence work too? I'd investigate myself but my computer is giving me some trouble.<br>
<br>
As far as I understand, <a id="itemlink" class="q1" style=" font-weight: bold;" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100223061722/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=45805" target="_blank">[Glyph of Disease]</a> only refreshes the duration a stated in its tooltip. If it actually reapplied the diseases, then RoR would be applied on the primary target. I'm leaning to the side that thinks that this is not actually the case.<br>
<br>
If I also understand correctly, since FF and BP tick every 3 seconds, using GoD to refresh the durations would mean a guaranteed clipping of the last tick - with or without Epidemic. Again, correct me if I'm wrong here but this appears to be a DPS loss meaning that this glyph is more so towards tanks than it already appears.<br>
<br>
Thanks for clearing this up.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1560266"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Perhaps I didn't phrase it correctly, RoR is never really "applied". It's better to understand it as a passive ability of your character that checks every time you cast anything / deal damage if the target has BP on it (doesn't have to be your BP).<br>
Now, when you cast your first PS the target doesn't have BP on it. So, PS doesn't get the 10% damage bonus. At the same time PS applies BP to your target, but at the time of applying BP wasn't on your target, yet (because you're applying it right now). So your first BP doesn't get the benefit from RoR. Because GoD rolls any percentage modifiers on your diseases (like Tricks of the Trade and, in this case, RoR) you would miss out on these 10% for the entire duration of the fight. That's why you will have to recast PS when BP is up so that you get those 10%.<br>
<br>
As for your second question, GoD refreshes durations of your diseases, it does not reapply them and therefore does not (or should not) affect when they tick. So you should not lose any ticks. However, I remember some reports of BP ticks behaving strangely with regards to GoD, but I don't recall what it was exactly.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
I normally run as Blood tank, though I'll use Frost for trash and for heroics for the AOE threat generation.<br>
<br>
I remember way back when, though, Unholy was a lot better at AOE threat than Frost was. Changes to Unholy Blight are when I started tanking that I used Frost instead (That and a personal preference). However, I'm starting to find it difficult to maintain threat in AOE situations, as the spec I'm using doesn't talent for D&amp;D.<br>
<br>
I looked at the DK tanking topic, which had a standard build, but the mention of Unholy Blight as a RP dump makes me think it hasn't been modified in a while.<br>
<br>
I'm wondering if I can get more out of Unholy spec, in terms of AOE threat, yet maintain or get even higher mitigation than I have now, and just how well Unholy tanking can perform at single-target tanking with the changes on Scourge Strike. In both situations, would the rotations remain the same?<br>
<br>
As a follow-up, how worthwhile is Glyph of Disease to such a spec  (assuming it will only be used on trash and in heroics) over other glyphs?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1560771"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Unholy tanking has inferior mitigation tools to both Blood and Frost tanking specs. Some tanks are experimenting with it in the Suno thread, but it's quite hard to compete with (a) the higher health and effective health of Blood, (b) the 2% damage reduction, +50% duration on IBF and 3% extra avoidance of Frost and (c) the TPS generation of either. There is no way, as you put it, to stay Unholy and take less beating / be less likely to die than either a Frost or a Blood tank.<br>
<br>
The proc-nerf which made Necrosis not affect RS hit Unholy TPS pretty hard, sadly.<br>
<br>
If you want more AoE threat than Frost currently offers, and this is particularly relevant to 5mans and trash, may I suggest an GoHB frost spec, specced into DnD, with Glyph of DnD (and perhaps 2*T10 set bonus). Pull with GoHB-HB, then park a monster-sized DnD under the pull. You can practically AFK for the rest of the fight.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">So I have done some extensiv searching for this, everyone seems to say its not possible.<br>
but! on this screenshot <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100223061722/http://img39.imageshack.us/i/23016129.jpg/" target="_blank">Imageshack - 23016129.jpg - Uploaded by deza5t3r</a> The scourge strike hits are obv merged. Now the guy who posted this dont even know how it happend. Can anyone tell me how to get MSBT or any battletext to merge the two SS hits?</div>

</div>With Parrot (and I assume most/all other SCT-type mods), Scourge Strike physical and shadow components are merged in the same manner as multiple hits from any other ability such as Whirlwind or Death and Decay. Specifically, combat log events are not shown immediately by default - they are shown 0.1 sec (or similar) after they occur, and any additional combat log event that occurs in that 0.1 sec window that the mod thinks is from the same ability will get merged as in the screenshot.<br>
<br>
The reason this does not typically result in Scourge Strike merging is because the shadow component does not occur simultaneous to the physical component but slightly afterward. In my experience, maybe 1/10 of scourge strikes appear 'merged' and the rest are separate, using Parrot's default merge threshold (0.1 sec). You can raise this threshold to make the merging more consistent; the tradeoff is that your damage will display that much later. There may also be an option to disable merging on specific abilities.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Think of it this way: Anything that -costs- one Rune generates 10. Anything that costs more than one rune, generates 15. CotG specifies that "when you use OB/IT/HB", which is a different clause. You will also note, CotG RP is not generated at the same time as the nominal 15RP. Stand at a target dummy, cast only one OB and you'll see first 15RP immediately as the OB hits, then a further 5 about a quarter of a second later.<br>
<br>
Rime-HB doesn't generate the nominal 15 but does generate the CotG 5.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1561377"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Edit: Ignore the BoSh question. After some in-game testing, I can already tell Unholy has no place in my specs. Bone Shield doesn't behave similarly to shaman shields, resulting in a max of 4 (when glyphed) hits you can take. A high avoidance rate would be needed to maintain its usage.<br>
<br>
Me again, with more Unholy tanking questions (want to make sure I have all info before I can get before daring to try some live testing).<br>
<br>
First one, Bone Shield, what is the time between when charges can be used? Is it like shaman shields, where a charge can only be used once every few seconds, regardless of being hit, or is it possible for Bone Shield to use all of its charges within less than 5 seconds (Due to being hit by multiple things).<br>
<br>
Second, Necrosis and Blood-Caked Blade. From some mathing, I'm getting that BCB is the better of the two (Use a sample of 10 1000 damage non-crit hits, added 20% for Necrosis, then factored out what BCB would give per swing and multiplied by 3 swings (30% of the 10 swings). However, Necrosis is the one used in the not-really-viable Unholy tank spec. Why is Necrosis considered better than BCB? Can BCB affect Rune Strike?<br>
<br>
Third, IIT, does the damage boost portion affect Frost Fever? (I currently assume no)<br>
<br>
Lastly, using a glyph set up of GoD, GoRS and GoBoSh, and using a talent spec that (somehow) obtains Reaping, would the following be a viable AOE tanking rotation:<br>
<br>
D&amp;D&gt;IT&gt;PS&gt;Pest&gt;SS&gt;SS&gt;Pest&gt;BlSt&gt;D&amp;D&gt;SS&gt;Pest&gt;Repeat from double SS (Replace BlSt with BoSh when the shield is down and the cooldown is up)<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1564703"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I recently resurrected my DK so I've been playing catch up with what spec/glyphs to use and what gear to obtain.  My question is this, if I'm using the AE unholy spec (due to having a tank offspec), do I still want to use Glyph of Disease or should I be using Glyph of Dark Death?<br>
<br>
Right now I've been using GoD with a rotation that looks something like this:  <br>

<br>
After that I keep casting SS, BS when needed to refresh the sigil proc, and Pest whenever diseases get down to ~3 seconds duration left.<br>

		<div id="post_message_1566030"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Two things, first I'm a little confused with hit rating for DW frost. I understand that we only need 5% melee hit (or was it 8%?) regardless, we also need a substantially higher spell hit rate, somewhere around 11% I believe. I'm assuming, I think correctly, that spell hit and melee hit calculate off of the same rating (the hit on most of our gear) so are these tied together? If I have 5% melee hit, will this automatically put me at the desired spell hit? Currently I'm a bit over on both, by a couple %, but I don't want to reduce to 5% melee hit to find out that I am no longer spell hit capped. Thoughts or suggestions on this?<br>
<br>
Also, I just recently switched from 4pt9 to 2pt9 and 2pt10. I noticed significantly higher numbers with the 4pt9 than with the other combo, so I searched through the threads and found the Unholy set bonus DPS chart, which indicated that across the ilvl board, 4pt9 is the best DPS... even over 4pt10. Is this chart outdated? If not, is it really better to just keep 4pt9? Seems a little counter intuitive.<br>
<br>
EDIT: I may have solved the second question myself, in that the t10 will obviously have better stats on it, so while the bonus may not be a higher DPS number, the stats may increase my DPS to such a point that it is negligible?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">All yellow physical abilities, for all classes in the game, versus a 83 lvl mob, require 8% hit. As frost you gain 3 of those from talents, meaning you must gain a further 5 from gear, or 4+dranei. All spells versus a 83lvl mob require 17% to cap. You gain 0/2/3 depending on spec variant from Virulence. You also gain a further 3% from raid buffs. The rest you gain from gear. You absolutely do not need to cap Hit for spells as a Frost DK. <br>
<br>
You gain Spell Hit % differently from Physical Hit %. Refer to different tabs on your char sheet: 8.0x% Phys is about 11.2x% Spell.<br>
<br>
Let me repeat this: You do not need to be Hitcapped for spells, nor is it a DPS gain to reach the hitcap, for spells (with respect to gearing for more Str/crit). A very small percentage of your damage is from spells.</div>

</div>After reading this I switched my boot enchant from hit to attack power, which I should have done awhile ago, but I'm still way overcapped - sitting around 10% melee hit. Currently I don't have the gear options to sub in something with less hit, but I'm over the expertise cap as well, and lacking a little in crit. All my gems are strength besides the meta, the nightmare tear and the activating yellow (i think it is). Is this simply something I will have to wait to change when more gear drops?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

The change to IT threat is for snap aggro, not sustained threat. DK's have no sustained threat issues, so spamming IT is a complete waste. The additional threat is so a DK tank can open up on a Boss (since IT is nearly always used as an opener because it's ranged, applies a disease, and applied the 20% melee haste debuff) and the DPS can start to full-on DPS right away without the tank having a heart attack.<br>

</div>There is no simple answer to a question like this. You basically have to sim your stats + &amp; - the changes and see what works best. Those #'s are VERY genralized based on typical stats at those gear levels. Having a couple different pieces than the set it was simmed with, or gear spread out over multiple gear levels will completely throw off the numbers.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>You should run a EP simulation of your own gear to be sure, but generally, yes expertise is a weaker stat for unholy. This is because Unholy actually has a free GCD or two during the rotation and because of this dodged attacks won't set you back much. If you are at the point where diseases are falling off before you can finish every rotation because you keep getting dodged attacks, then you should invest in "some" expertise. However for Blood and Frost it is increasingly valuable because these rotations are much tighter and rely more on their physical attacks landing.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Now, assuming I meanage to reach and DoT all of them, I'm trying to get my build and gear as good as possible for AoE (DoT damage). I'm considering use of 4pc t9 and AP trinket (245 Death's Choice) instead of ArP trinket (277 Deathbringer's Will) and 4pc t10 (and ofc crit meta instead of agi one).

[note: I'm the only person who can actually slow Valkyries during p2 so Desecration is must-to-take]<br>
I'm not sure if 10% damage from both diseases (Black Ice) actuually wins over 2 extra points in Bladed Armor (more AP scaling with disease damage) and extra 5% crit for Blood Plague (assuming use of 4p t9). Cold logic says it is, but I cant get calculator to confirm or deny it for some reason :|. Any opiniony or advices?<br>
<br>
We run setup with only 3 ranged, and just 2 of them (spriest and fire mage) being strong at AoE, so my diseases support is very usefull. It's gonna be RLY rng-based for us as any ranged being ported to Frostmourne means mostly like explidong spirits.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I'm trying to get my build and gear as good as possible for AoE (DoT damage). I'm considering use of 4pc t9 and AP trinket (245 Death's Choice) instead of ArP trinket (277 Deathbringer's Will) and 4pc t10 (and ofc crit meta instead of agi one). Now, I also consider changing my build a bit to boots DoT damage (as single-target DPS requirements are joke in 10m anyways).</div>

</div>While I won't say you should not do it, I did the achivement with my regular trinkets DBW 264 and 258 deaths choice with agility meta gem (changing meta is marginal and should not be a concern) I used my 4 x tier 10, I mean considering the massiv strength boost and the 3% damage from the 4 set. I am pretty sure this will rival your crit from 4 x tier 9. Also consider that someone has to do single target dps or the encounter will never end here just keeping your regular gear and spec will be beneficial aswell<br>

</div>First of all it's 10 man, there is no need what so ever to spec into Desercration, you can just chains of ice it.<br>
secondly thats not true you said yourself you got a shadowpriest &amp; a fire mage both of which has very nice slows (mind flay will be the best option here) fair better then you specing some semi retarded spec when he can just use his "main nuke" not knowing the rest of your setup I would guess there is other slow options (frost shock forexample) and multiple of stuns. it's one add .. one! trust me it's handable without you respecing.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I'm not sure if 10% damage from both diseases (Black Ice) actuually wins over 2 extra points in Bladed Armor (more AP scaling with disease damage) and extra 5% crit for Blood Plague (assuming use of 4p t9). Cold logic says it is, but I cant get calculator to confirm or deny it for some reason :|. Any opiniony or advices?</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">We run setup with only 3 ranged, and just 2 of them (spriest and fire mage) being strong at AoE, so my diseases support is very usefull. It's gonna be RLY rng-based for us as any ranged being ported to Frostmourne means mostly like explidong spirits.</div>

</div>We did this with two more ranged (a warlock &amp; a resto shaman going elemental) and I would strongly sugest you sit a melee for a warlock as SoC is ace here.<br>
on our first port it was our spriest (our best aoe) and we still got all the sprits down so it is doable with 3 but if you get a ranged ported you are screwed. Do yourself a favor bring an extra ranged! Also you will/should use chains of ice alot on these it is amazingly usefull and buys your ranged much time as they start to come down chains them. Alittle sidenote elemental shamans can knock them back.<br>
<br>
I wish you good luck, but I strongly sugest bringing more ranged dps, and use only 2 healers.<br>
the drakes are worth it my friend.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>
