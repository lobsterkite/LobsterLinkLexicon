				<strong>The Perfect Raid - To hybrid or not?</strong>

		<div id="post_message_408495">I have been trying to calculate hybrid additions to raid in order to see what class belongs to what group and so on. All this is pretty common knowledge, and widely used on guilds. Estimations indicate that hybrids bring pretty good additions to raid performance. Shadowpriest as classic example of perfect hybrid, brings good personal DPS, giving great raid DPS increase trough shadowvulne/misery and offering reasonable offhealing and manaregen while doing damage. Shadowpriests are effective raid members, everyone knows and loves them. But how about other hybrids? I recently had shocking collision with the most succesful guild in the world, yes Nihilum. Because of the following quote (Interview of Awake on WoW Insider).<br>
<br>
<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px; ">

	<tbody><tr>
		<td class="alt2" style="border:1px inset">
			
				<b>Quick questions about classes: How many DPS warriors do you all use? Any Moonkin? Any tanking Paladins? Any enhancement Shamans?</b><br>
<br>
<u>We aim for efficiency. So no, we do not use any Moonkins, Protection Paladins, Retribution Paladins or anything that is way below the standard classes that can do a much better job at said task.</u> We do however use bears to offtank and we sometimes bring 1-2 DPS warriors. Not because we need them for the DPS they provide, but for the buffs they give to our DPS. Overall it's more efficient. Guilds that go with Protection Paladins and Moonkins will not do as well as the ones that bring an optimal raid setup. This is a fact.

	</tbody></table>
</div>To make it clear, I am not trying to discredit their achievements. They have done great job so far. Im just not convinced by Awake's description of their most efficient raid setup not including any "offspec" hybrids. There is no right and wrong raid setup, thats pretty obvious. All guilds are different. But lets try to see in rough estimation how hybrids really effect raids. Because I just cant agree with the statement <b>"way below the standard classes"</b><br>
<br>
I gathered totally random DPS numbers from Praetorian's WWS thread, while using common sense on avoiding AoE DPS numbers and such. Keeping the 10 class average DPS numbers what average player could do in X raid (I used many EJ WWS reports as they seem to have pretty solid playerbase). I lack "samples" from hybrids, as it was shocking low how people actually use hybrids as dps. (I had false expectations as our guild uses moonkins/ferals/ench/ele/retri on regular basis trough all bosses in TK and SSC). I would appreciate if said offspec players could give WWS reports of their raids to add in more samples for hybrids.<br>
<br>
Here are my flumsy results so far...<br>
<br>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20070921120917im_/http://cromfel.battlefield.fi/wow/perfect_raid.jpg" border="0" alt="" onload="NcodeImageResizer.createOn(this);"><br>
<br>
Speadsheet available: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070921120917/http://cromfel.battlefield.fi/wow/perfect_raid1.ods" target="_blank">http://cromfel.battlefield.fi/wow/perfect_raid1.ods</a><br>
(Open Office)<br>
<br>
So from my rough calculations, hybrids seem to perform better than core classes due raid additions they bring. By no means these are exact and perfect simulations of hybrid contributions trough moonkin/feral auras, improved faerie fire, improved sanctity aura and sanctified crusader. All those skills had flat +% dmg according to their crit modifier. If someone wants to enchance that spreadsheet to get more accurate numbers, feel free to do so. I used +% as it was close enough to give example of the contribution (Some raidleader gave even higher increase in DPS than the increased crit rating when evaluating different class skills).<br>
<br>
I made randomly created "Nihilum" raid, without hybrids and <b>their raid DPS would be 100%</b> (I tried to get their exact raid setup but havent been succesful finding it, so I had to throw this setup from my head). Then I changed 1 Rogue and 1 Warlock to Moonkin and Paladin, what gave <b>3,24% increase</b> in raid DPS. On other example Paladin got swapped with Feral Druid, what gave <b>2.07% dps increase</b> when comparing to non-hybrid "Nihilum" raid. From these calculations it seems that using hybrids is extremely valid option, as it is not to use them (Nihilum has been the most succesful guild without using hybrids so far).<br>
<br>
Be gentle, Im not perfect and there may be some small calculation errors. But from previous experience these nubers should be good enough to draw some conclusions of hybrid raid contribution.</div>

The other issue is finding people who are both reliable and highly skilled who play those classes. There are very, very few Moonkin druids on the server I play on, and of those quite a number focus on PvP as their priority.

Not to poke too much at Awake, but he's been known for making some pretty inflammatory statements about raiding in general. Many here will recall his claims that Alchemy/Herbalism concerns were "overblown" and that its "not hard" to farm all the herbs you need for a week in "an hour or so" for full consumable use on every fight while only having herbalism at around 75 on his own character.</div>

I'm usually grouped with 4 mages, or 3 mages and a boomkin, even if my buffs are only equal to +200 damage per caster, thats still +800 damage to the caster group, I usually do around 70-80% of the best mages damage, while keeping my group alive.<br>

		<div id="post_message_408560">Interesting idea, i do think most guilds run full SSC or TK with 4-5 tanks tough so only bringing 3 warriors would barely work. (It's prolly possible if done clever, but i dunno, say Karathres with 3 tanks? Same on Al'ar prolly doable but complicated, VR seems easier with 4-5 too, etc etc)<br>
<br>
It'll be different from guild to guild what you bring to fill the tank slots, my guess is that 2x prot war, 1x arms war and a feral for the last slot with an optional fury war or feral for the 5th slot is the optimal raid.<br>
You also only have one shadowpriest and you put him with the warlocks, while putting him with the healers is usually a better choice.<br>
<br>
I suggest you reduce this two doing maths with only two groups as it seems simpler and fairer.<br>
1) Melee dps group with 2-4 rogues, and then compare the other 1-3 slots filled with enhc shaman, warrior (dps aka imp bs), feral, retri pallie.<br>
2) Caster dps group with 2-4 mages, and then compare the other 1-3 slots filled with ele shaman, moonkin, retri pallie, spriest (mana regen will have an effect on dps in most fights), destro lock.<br>
<br>
I think that'd give you a better overview to compare the dps. Basically it boils down to comparing raid dps of the main dps groups when you replace a pure dps class with a hybrid one.<br>
<br>
Putting a moonkin with 3 holy pallies and a shadowpriest sounds interesting as well, but even more complex to calculate.<br>
<br>
<br>
Would be interesting to have a raid simulator spreadsheet, but i got the feeling it's nearly impossible todo.</div>

</div>This is a silly thing to say in my opinion, since there are times when certain "non-optimal" hybrids are going to do a far better job than one of the more "pure" classes.  For example, a Protection Pally is a far better tank for adds on Al'ar than either a Druid or a Warrior, because they have a ranged taunt that hits multiple targets.  Druid and Warrior don't even come close to this kind of utility in a fight like this.  Hydross and Tidewalker are other examples where a Prot Pally on adds is just vastly superior to any other option.<br>
<br>
I guess if you are trying to create a single group of 25 raiders to clear all content in the game, you could take the hard-line approach that Awake is taking above, but I don't think even Nihilium has the exact same 25 raiders show up every night.  Certainly those guys know what they are doing when it comes to raiding, but that comment is short-sighted and stupid, imho.  Hybrid specs may not be the best choice for 100% of the encounters out there, but for select encounters they can really trivialize certain difficulties.</div>

</div>Yea, I think that's mostly what's stopped people from gearing hybrids up nowadays. No one is really sure how much damage their "off-spec" can do, and in order to test it reliably, they'll need T5 equivalent pieces in every slot. But to obtain the best gear, they're going to have to sacrifice gear for their "pure" role and waste tokens for a spec that they may not even stay.<br>
<br>
A look at the other accepted hybrid classes loot availability:<br>
<br>
<b>DPS Warriors</b>: Full array of slots available from crafted to boss-specific drops to benefit both Arms AND Fury.<br>
<b>Shadow Priests</b>: Can get a full set of T5 equivalent gear without even zoning into SSC or TK.<br>
<b>Feral Druids</b>: Close to a full set of specific off-gear available for every slot.<br>
<br>
Now, let's look at some other hybrids:<br>
<br>
<b>Enhancement Shamans</b>: Shares drops with rogues, warriors, and hunters.<br>
<b>Elemental Shaman</b>s: Some specific drops, but mostly share with mages and warlocks.<br>
<b>Ret Paladin</b>: Some specific drops, must take others from established hybrid (warriors).<br>
<b>Moonkin</b>: Very few specific drops, must take items from "pure" DPS classes.<br>
<br>
I think there is a correlation between raid viability and availability of drops.<br>
<br>
As for our raids, I would love to have a geared Moonkin and Ret Paladin; but drops simply do not allow it. As far as hybrids, we have 3 very active shadow priests (avg: 2 per raid), 2 feral druids (1 per raid), 2 elemental shaman (0-1 per raid), and 3 DPS warriors (100% attendance).</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">A mage friend of mine who loves theory crafting worked out that my buffs (4% hit, 3% crit +121 damage) equate to around +250 damage for him (full frost spec) as long as he gears around it (stays 4% from hit cap).<br>
<br>
I'm usually grouped with 4 mages, or 3 mages and a boomkin, even if my buffs are only equal to +200 damage per caster, thats still +800 damage to the caster group, I usually do around 70-80% of the best mages damage, while keeping my group alive.<br>
<br>
We are very mage heavy (just got our first leo kill 6x mage 2x ele shaman 1x lock 0 shadow priests)<br>

</div>I feel that adding a shadow priest with a 5% damage buff to all of those casters and another 10% buff to the lock would probably outweigh a 30% increased casting speed buff for 40 seconds for a single group, once per fight. I can guarantee that a shadow priest would add 200-250 mp/5 rather than a flat 30 mp/5 from a totem.<br>

		<div id="post_message_408603">There are other subtler effects.  Here's my favorite example:  I absolutely love raiding with enhance shamans.  Why?  Because if we don't have one, I have to drop WF/SoE for the melee group.  And if I have to do that, it means no shadowpriest for me.  With a spriest, on any given boss fight,  it is almost assured that I will be #1 on effective healing, except for very specific cases like the PoH priest whose Gurtogg group is eating two Bloodboils every phase cycle.  <br>
<br>
It really is no exaggeration to say that on a healing intensive fight like Teron, Gurtogg, (hell, even Void Reaver as melee healer), etc., I can do two healers' worth of pure healing IF I have a shadow priest (and no, it's not a case of the shadow priest saving me gold -- I drink mana pots like water as a given).  We did Gurtogg with 7 healers this timer and I was good on mana until the end.  If I'd had to drop WF for the melee, I'd have been OOM and completely unable to do things like bloodlust my healer group and spam max-rank HWs for 30sec on a Fel Rage'd mage 7 minutes into the fight.  <br>

I doubt it's intentionally done by designers to sort of hint the raidgroups out there about what to bring and whatnot as you seem to suggest.

</div>They <b>are</b> terrible OFF-tanks. This is because a lot prot Paladin threat is reflective (Holy Shield, BoSanctuary, Ret Aura, Reckoning), so if the Paladin is not a frequent target of the mob, their threat generation is really quite poor. I think its pretty widely acknowledged that paladins do an excellent job as the primary target for AE tanking and similar tasks, but they just aren't set up to OT very well at the moment (and don't have the advantages of a warrior for MT, etc. etc.)</div>

</div>Offtank has two (main) meanings:<br>
<br>
A) To offtank a mob, which is separate from the main boss. In this instance, prot paladins are very good, but if theres "downtime" in between tanking (i.e. Lurker), they aren't as effective as a feral tank.<br>
<br>
B) To be a second tank on the boss, such as Gruul, Supremus (although I think this is health based more than threat based), or EoS P2. In this case, protection paladins suck as they block one hit every 10 seconds or so (or even less), which heavily reduces their threat production. Feral tanks work much better in this case.<br>

</div>Because all of the raw stats are higher, TBC has magnified the effects of percentage-based abilities a ton. Paladins don't get any useful passive deaggro like Fury Warriors do, so their relative threat ceiling is actually very low compared to "real" DPS classes, and it's only aggravated by the fact that they're the single burstiest class in the game.</div>

</div>The cold, hard, immutable fact that Paladins generate the least threat on fights like Void Reaver and others? You are taking the term "Off Tank" out of context - OT means "Not the Main Tank" and yes while they are good in a few AOE situations - its nothing a Hellfire Warlock with 16k health can't do with more *options* afterwards. What does your Prot Paladin do when he isn't tanking Morogrim adds? This is the crux of the issue.<br>

</div>Yes, he was threat capped to the point where he would have to turn off autoattack. Its specifically bad on Magtheridon due to Exorcism/Hwrath's additional damage. If your Ret Paladins aren't outdpsing every other melee class other than Rogues, your Paladins are doing something wrong. Seal of Blood + Windfury is *totally* broken, and honestly should be nerfed with how good it is.<br>
<br>
But again - the crux of the issue is flexibility. Why bring a Prot Paladin when you could bring a Feral Druid who can Innervate, Crez, Tank, Offtank, and DPS all in one fight. While a Prot Paladin only brings abysmal healing in proper gear, BOP, and marginally better AOE threat.<br>
<br>
Ret would be great - but its too threat capped and a liability on many fights. If they give Ret a threat reduction (innate or otherwise) I can see pretty much everyone bringing one on raids since JOW/JOL is so huge, and its a pita keeping it up otherwise.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Believe me, I wish prot was viable.

</div>Totally agree, we have 3 shadow priests, we average 1 per raid, 2 is awsome, our highest attendance SP was out at transformers that day (we have 4 100% attendance holy priests, hopefully one respecs!)<br>
<br>
We also run with a LOT of feral druids, they are awsome, I'd much rather bring ferals than a second prot warrior, super high agro generation, decent cat dips, great damage mitigation, ability to heal/innervate/battle res. I don't think 3 ferals is overkill at all.<br>
<br>
How about DPS warriors, if you only have a single DPS warrior, i think MS with the 4% damage buff would be better than a fury.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Because all druids have healed, and will heal again at one time or another. The same goes for Shamans and Priests.<br>
<br>
When we have a shortage of healers on during a raid night; instead of cancelling the raid I have one of the hybrids respec. It's a huge subtle bonus that hybrids offer that shouldn't be ignored in times of need.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_408653" style="min-height: 183px;"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->My opinions on hybrids are somewhat mixed. I used to be a purist snob, but a couple folks have have managed to change my mind. Obviously, shadow priests aren't the same class they were pre-2.0. <br>
<br>
But in the past couple of months, I've come to really like Elemental shaman. Dropping 3 mages in a group with an elemental shaman and a shadow priest has something of a wrecking ball effect. I personally love totem of Wrath because it means I don't have to swap out some gear for boss fights to get hit capped. But at the same time, the shaman has to be able to keep up to justify his raid spot. It's not always an easy task, but a good player behind an elemental shaman can contribute.<br>
<br>
As far as enchancement goes, for whatever reason, they seem to put out a whole boatload of damage these days. Ours gives me a run for my money, and can often pull ahead if it's a fight where I have to stop casting for any length of time for whatever reason. The only thing I can say negative about our enhancement shaman is that he pulls aggro and dies. Alot.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Being able to bloodlust all 5 groups really helps for a number of fights, P1 of Mags is much easier, we kill Hunter/Shaman on FLK and use bloodlust on the Shaman significantly reducing the amount of time we're in on him and making it easier to kill the spitfire, etc.<br>
<br>
The paladin situation, many carry 3 holy spec to get the blessing trifecta but this leaves the raid without judgements in most cases as they're difficult for a healer to maintain position wise on many fights.  An example of this helping again is FLK, the Paladin is going to be able to pickup the hunter pet much easier through consecration spam as it spawns and even if they miss it the ranged taunt will bring it back (where with a warrior he has to get it or a hunter needs to grab it with misdirect and send it back).<br>
<br>
The reasoning for carrying a 2nd Resto Druid over a 2nd Priest is they can do "roughly" the same healing and we're picking up another Battle Rez (4 total in the raid).  The 5 Shaman also have ankhs and with 2 Warlocks half the raid can come back from the dead.<br>
<br>
With the 5% extra Crit from the Moonkin aura our Mages/Elemental Shaman (with the Elemental Shaman they're getting a total of +8% crit and 3% hit letting them wear more crit gear and still be at the hit cap) don't need a Shadow Priest, they all are able to go the full duration of any fights we're doing now (10-15 mins) on potions with the mana back from the crits and it adds to their damage directly rather than just feeding them more mana.<br>
<br>
The hardest part for us seems to be finding excellent raiders in many of the slots as "power gamers" listen to stuff that people like Awake say and roll classes that are likely to get wide acceptance into a raid environment.  We have managed to fill most of our slots now with people that are good and have that 'chip on their shoulder' to prove something and generally people with something to prove bring it all the time.  Hopefully as these specs gain more acceptance it'll be easier to find and field the proper raid.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

You don't need an enhancement shaman in group 1. Drop him for a 3rd warlock (affliction specced for easy imp usage -- he also provides a 3rd curse on bosses). Note: Tanks don't need heroism, ever.<br>
<br>
Also, group 2 needs a Warrior. Battle shout &gt; *. In addition, I believe that Elemental Shamans and Moonkins cannot compete on damage unless they have a shadow priest. Drop the 2nd resto druid for the paladin in group 3. Put a 3rd shadow priest in group 3.<br>
<br>
Now... that's the best possible, most versitle raid comp. 6 healers is kinda low, but with all of them having shadow priests, mana shouldn't be an issue. The prot paladin will probably have to heal on most solo-tanked boss fights.<br>

		<div id="post_message_408692"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->My take on the whole hybrid thing is that in the end it boils down to players more than raid builds.<br>

I was never convinced by enhanced shaman ( boo boo i know)... And just let the guy do what he wanted because i knew he would play well. In the end it worked out very well.<br>
<br>
We tend to run low on hybrids however only using 1 arms warrior and 1 enhance shaman ?<br>
<br>
This might be in another thread but are there any theorycrafting threads about when arms become more interesting than fury to the raid ?

		<div id="post_message_408712"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I really find it strange that someone can say dps warriors are worth using and claim enhance shaman aren't. For a decently geared and buffed melee group unleashed rage alone is over 300AP and enhance and fury both threat cap at similar places and do similar damage.<br>
<br>
Then the are the 'hidden' benefits. As enhance I am always physically with the melee, when we need to move I can redrop totems, appart from Hyjal trash with crypt fiends present (oh how they love to eat totems) I can be sure the melee always have 100% totem uptime. I gain useful buffs from any warrior/feral I am grouped with, and don't cry about a lack of a shadow priest. <br>
<br>
For a few raids when we have lacked healers due to holidays/illness/attunement etc I have been resto and still been the melee totem bitch. It really is annoying trying to keep totems up and in range of them on some fights as resto, a shadow priest gives insane regen boosts but isn't an option meaning you can't heal as much as you otherwise would, and dropping wf means a lack of wrath of air (which although not huge is a nice boost to +heal). Then without mid combat group swapping mana tide will only give 1 player mana gain. <br>
<br>
Put simply melee need totems, and in my opinion they are far better served having the enhance shaman with them than a resto one who gains nothing from the group and loses what he could get/give with a caster/healer group.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_408720"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Would like to see analysis on Feral+Hunter combos. The +5% crit aura is a significant boost for Hunters:<br>
<br>
- Hunters have talents boosing crit damage<br>
- BM Pets have several proc-on-crit DPS-boosting abilities, including Ferocious Inspiration (3% increase to all types of damage done by party members; stacks with FI procs from other Hunters in the group). Increased crit will increase FI uptime, increasing the entire group's DPS.<br>
<br>
Also, the feral in your example is only benefitting from Battle Shout, as the Shaman is almost certainly going to use Windfury instead of Grace of Air (it's worth noting that WF benefits neither Ferals nor Hunters).<br>
<br>
<br>
Modeling optimal groups is an interesting and complex problem. Some classes have group buffs that affect different classes in different ways, sometimes reciprocally as in the FI case above. Other classes merely leech buffs but do a ton of DPS as a result.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Arms is very, very viable raid dps nowadays with improved slam (personally, I'm top 5 on almost every fight). It's possibly as good or better than Fury when considering the benefits. <br>
<br>
Blood Frenzy is a huge DPS increase for all of the physical DPSers as well. The above thread is really long, but somewhere in the middle: someone figured out exactly how much DPS contribution Blood Frenzy provides; and it was a lot.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>He wouldn't be dropping Strength of Earth for some reason? That alone is ~220 AP untalented for a feral, talented with Unleashed Rage its somewhere around 270 I believe. If it happens to be an enhancement shaman, total AP contribution will be something like 750 AP at an end-game level.<br>
<br>
We generally switch it around depending on fight and group setup. Normally our melee group is rogue/rogue/warrior/enhshaman/feral, but sometimes the feral is switched for a third rogue.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

If you want to prove the viability of specs that Awake does not like please focus on Moonkins and prot/ret pallys.  Actually, he called out the two specs that most would agree are the hardest to justify.  Prot pally and Moonkins.  Yes, if you dig hard enough you might be able to find a perfect raid situation/makeup that MAY justify them, but 99% of the time the raid would be better off with the real deal.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_408751"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Just thought I'd add approximately what each class buffs can mean to a raiding <b>rogue</b> (with SSC level gear). I calculated this awhile ago for the guild and thought I'd share.<br>
<br>
<font color="brown"> DPS Warrior</font><br>
Battle shout (382 AP) -  ~130 DPS<br>
Blood Frenzy (RAID wide) -  ~55 DPS<br>
<br>
<font color="cyan">Enh Shaman</font><br>
Strength of Earth (99str)  -  ~35 DPS<br>
Windfury (delta from poisons) -  ~130 DPS for swords, ~90 DPS from daggers.<br>
Unleashed Rage (10% AP) -   ~88 DPS<br>
Heroism is a HUGE dps buff. Haste is the single most impressive thing you can do to a rogue.<br>
<br>
<font color="orange">Feral Druid</font><br>
Leader of the Pack  (5% crit) -  ~55 DPS<br>
Faerie Fire (RAID wide - not improved) -  ~60 DPS<br>
<br>
<font color="green">Hunter</font><br>
Trueshot Aura (group wide 125 AP) -  ~37 DPS<br>
Expose Weakness (RAID wide - depends on the hunters AGI, most survival hunters will be around 950 raid buffed) -  ~75 dps<br>
Improved Hunters Mark -  ~37 dps<br>
The 3% inspire ferocious thing is in the neighborhood of ~40 DPS as well.<br>
<br>
<font color="purple">Warlock</font><br>
Curse of Recklessness (RAID wide) -  ~80 DPS<br>
<br>
Make what you will of it, but to my eyes, and in my personal experience, a 1 DPS warrior, 1 ENH shaman, 3 x Rogue group cannot be topped.<br>
<br>
Also keep in mind that certain buffs, like unleashed rage, scale very well with other buffs. Putting a warrior in a group with that enh shaman will add ~40 AP to his group buff. Man I just love Synergy.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I have been trying to calculate hybrid additions to raid in order to see what class belongs to what group and so on. All this is pretty common knowledge, and widely used on guilds. Estimations indicate that hybrids bring pretty good additions to raid performance. Shadowpriest as classic example of perfect hybrid, brings good personal DPS, giving great raid DPS increase trough shadowvulne/misery and offering reasonable offhealing and manaregen while doing damage.</div>

Without being able to see your spreadsheet (404 Not Found), I thought I'd add in some corrections based on the errors I found with the retribution_calculator I found on your site.<br>
<br>
I think you (significantly?) overestimate the dps contribution of Sanctified Crusader, it certainly isn't the 1.03 modifier that it might appear to be at first look.<br>
<br>
Firstly, Shadowpriest/Affliction Warlocks have roughly 20% of their damage able to crit  Secondly, high crit classes like Rogues and Fire Mages don't get so much out of +3% crit.  A rogue moving from 25% crit chance to 28% is only realizing a 2.4% dps increase, which is a full 20% less than the assumed 3% bonus to damage.<br>
<br>
<br>
Another thing that bothers me with utility of the +hit spell hit totem and +hit fairie fire is that most people seem to fill out their hit rating to cap via gemming, which makes it harder to gearswap around having/not having the buff in your raid/group.  Not a huge problem to work around, but it can be a minor headache with nonstatic raid groups.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_408826"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Most of the hybrid builds have been embraced by this point. <br>
<br>
Moonkin is an uphill battle. On paper their dps and party buffs compare similarly to elemental shaman but they lack the utility of bloodlust and quick heals. They are in a bad situation and should likely be improved. <br>
<br>
As far as hybrid pallies go, I think an indirect problem facing them is that they have to be compared to Holy spec. Holy paladins heal a main tank so damn well that it is almost absurd. Eventually there is just a boundary to how many of a class you want around in a 25 man raid. If you always have 2-3 holy spec it is hard to make room for more.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				So I went through one of our Gruul WWSes (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100516143132/http://eleventhhour.org/wws/wws-2007...014/index.html" target="_blank">http://eleventhhour.org/wws/wws-2007...014/index.html</a>), and did some number crunching based on observed crit rates and average crit values of every ability used by every dpser in the raid, then compared the additional damage a 3% increase in the observed rate of crittable abilities to actual damage done. Here's what I found in terms of damage increase by class:<br>
<br>
Druid (1): 3.71%<br>
Hunter (2): 5.10%<br>
Mage (5): 3.73%<br>
Priest (1): 0.45%<br>
Rogue (3): 4.60%<br>
Warlock (5): 1.74%<br>
Warrior (2): 4.87%<br>
<br>
Overall Gain: 3.21%<br>
<br>
This doesn't take into account additional damage from effects triggered by crits such as flurry or ignite, so actual damage gained would be a bit higher.<br>
<br>
As we can see, shadow priests and warlocks gain little from additional crit, as expected, while other classes gain significantly more. The overall gain would depend on class distribution, but even with a high number of warlocks (5) plus a shadow priest, the gain is still above 3%.

	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>What gives estimate of <b>3.21% overall dps gain</b> from Sanctified Crusader. So the +3% as direct number shouldnt be too much off. Edit: I do acknowledge the problem with Improved FF, as I assume that people get full benefit from it (Even if they were hit capped).<br>

I think this is really the key statement here - Nihilium is doing things their own way, and that way is to take pure classes only. Hey it works for them, and yet hybrids work well for many many other guilds.

In any case, Our survivalist hunter hangs out with the feral druid and the crit aura keeps him from going OOM, while buffing the entire melee raid significantly.

</div>Having to rely on tier gear is part of the problem, particularly when you're trying an "experimental" build or something about which many guilds might be skeptical in the first instance.  In most guilds, you're not realistically going to be getting multiple types of tier gear once you get past t4, so by taking the moonkin piece or the ret piece you're committing to that.  And at the same time, if you need the gear to prove the viability of the spec, you're basically at an experimental stage.  Are you going to take an experimental piece of gear over a primary-use item for a tank or some such?  It's hard.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I think this is really the key statement here - Nihilium is doing things their own way, and that way is to take pure classes only. Hey it works for them, and yet hybrids work well for many many other guilds. The issue is that Awake is abrasive and his dismissal of hybrids comes across as "hybrids are not efficient and nobody should take them because they're a waste of a slot."

</div>His point is 'they are a waste of a slot if you are interested in the fastest progression'.  Given that they are the fastest progressing guild, then it is hard to argue with their results.<br>
<br>
If you want to argue that people should be given freedom to play a game in a way that caters to their own enjoyment, I don't think you'd find many people arguing against you, but they have backed up their own argument about the rate of progression with pure classes pretty damn well empirically.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Thisis where I've usually seen the line drawn in the sand as far as raiad makeup.  Using my own experiences as both leading raids pre-tbc, and observing raid invites post-tbc, raid leaders really try to be fair to all classes, especially of the members of each class are exceptional at what they do.  It really realy has to do with the raid leader knowing his raid team.  <br>
<br>
We tried a ret pally in a  few raids to see if it was worth the raid spot, and it turned out the paladin himself didn't do enough personal DPS to warrant being there only for the raid buff.  Maybe that paladin wasn't very good, maybe there were other factors, but sometimes the competition is just too tight to have 4-5 paladins with one being dps, and making a mage/lock/hunter/rogue sitout when theres really nothing else those classes can pick from but DPS.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_408923"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Well Prot paladins a getting a lot of bad press here.  It's really not as dismal as people make it out to be, and I can guarantee that most of you who are railing against prot pallies, quite obviously don't have any in your raids.<br>
<br>
In situations where I'm offtanking, such as void reaver, I really have no issues matching warrior threat.  My downfall of course is if I'm not holding aggro I end up having to drink mana potions as frequently as if I was healing, but threat is not the issue at all.<br>
<br>
There are few situations where I'm forced to tank in full prot gear and feel useless by the end of the fight.  The time between murloc phases on morogrim is so short that anyone has marginal utility when "not tanking".  On Karathress I can tank the hunter and his pet with no problem simultaneously building threat on both.  Once they die (we kill them second) I can swap on my healing mace/shield, quaff a mana potion and still do patchup healing for totems and bolts.  On Leotheras I can tank an add in full heal gear.<br>
<br>
On void reaver I can pull aggro if I start too quickly, meaning the warriors are rage starved.  I prefer NOT to pull aggro because I can put out more threat as a mana starved paladin than a rage starved warrior.<br>
<br>
I think a lot of the bad press comes from prot paladin gear tiers.  There's a point somewhere after dungeon gear where the "paladin designed" gear is too weak to tank anything significant, while the warrior designed gear is great, but gives you no spell damage.  At that point your threat is marginal at best, your health is less than a warrior's and you're struggling to pass the crushing cap.<br>
<br>
Once you can start to get past that, your health still falls behind the warriors, but all of a sudden you realize that you can actually put out a lot of threat, and worrying about being crushed is no longer a concern.<br>
<br>
That of course combined with the baseline abilities (round of blessings, aura, wipe recovery) and the fact that my tiered set doesn't share a token with warriors' like the druid's does, and my ability to maintain a very respectable amount of healing in heal gear, makes me a good choice for an OT in my opinion.<br>
<br>
A lot of people have just not even tried, or if they have tried, not tried wholeheartedly, to use some of these offspecs.  There's just the assumption that they will suck. The assumption that because your trial alt pally tank in blues had a hard time keeping secondary aggro on moroes, that there's no way a pally tank would manage on void reaver.<br>
<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100516143132/http://www.lossendil.com/wws/?report=1e2tkphslh3po&amp;s=4455-4983" target="_blank">http://www.lossendil.com/wws/?report...po&amp;s=4455-4983</a> Here is our void reaver last night.  I took 21% of the damage.  More importantly I took more hits than our warrior tanks.  Meaning that I generated OT threat rather well if you ask me.  <br>
<br>
Generalizations like "Prot pallies can't generate OT threat" are just that.  Yeah, I generate more threat when I'm getting hit than when I'm not.  But so do warriors, and so do druids.<br>
<br>
Most guilds who say "You can't do this" really dont know if you can or not.  All they really know is that they don't need to, and have never tried it.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Speaking as the person that usually does the inviting for our raids, I'd agree completely with this.  I hate to rule out certain specs as "non-viable", but I've had a hard time finding the evidence that a ret pally or moonkin isn't a wasted raid slot.  I personally can't wait for the review of these specs.  One of the things I enjoy most about putting together raids is working with different synergies in creative ways.  Having a couple more options will only make it more fun.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I think their place as clearly the top guild has much more to do with the inordinate amount of time their members are willing to devote to the raiding game than it has much to do with Awake's personal opinion on matters.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>You may very well be right, but these numbers don't prove anything.  It's practically impossible to infer threat from WWS info - there are any number of reasons that you could have taken more hits than anyone else that don't have any correlation to you having as much OT tps than other classes.  Also, given the lack of another OT class in the data, there's no comparison to be made at all.<br>

At least one Hunter in the raid should have 5/5 Improved Mark for melee benefit (I do). Most raiding BM Hunters (well, most raiding Hunters period) spec 20 points into MM for Mortal Shots, so it's a toss-up between Improved Mark and Efficiency.<br>

		<div id="post_message_409081"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I think one of the hardest parts of selling a Hybrid class (I'll use the Retribution Paladin as my example) is just who is going to fill that role. I'm sure most guilds only have a small pool of very reliable raiders, and when you're looking to fill the off spec role you want to try and use someone who you know is good at their class.<br>
<br>
Here's where the trouble starts:<br>
I've recently created a list of gear from Crafted/SSC/TK that is for the most part uncontested, save Prot warriors. With it, I'd have about 1850AP 8% hit 30% crit 120 damage unbuffed, without using any Tier5 tokens. This is a pretty solid gear set, and I think I could be pretty viable in a raid slot, however, I know it'll never happen. Why? The issue, which I'm sure may plague a lot of other guilds, is you'd be losing one of your top, most reliable healers in the process. I've geared up with a lot of healing drops, and I just can't see how it'd be fair to toss that aside and assume a different role.<br>
<br>
I guess what I'm getting at is there's two parts to the argument for Hybrids:<br>
1) Will this spec be worth bringing to the raid and will it outdo the pure class you'd bring instead<br>
2) Can you afford to lose whoever is taking up that role?<br>
It seems clear that the person who shows up to raids and does well as a healer is going to be generally accepted as the better player, is going to have a better chance at getting the off spec loot, and would be one of the first people that turn toward the off spec. The question, however, is can you replace them? <br>
<br>
How many people had one of their top Healing priests go Shadow when the Burning Crusade came out? It's because they were the most trusted to do well in this unfamiliar territory. At BC it wasn't hard to replace them, since different people were gearing up and there were fewer raid slots. Now, discounting the recent position of healing priests, say if that same priest was counted on to show up to every raid in BT/Hyjal, and his healing was highly influential to the success of your raids, would it be feasible for him to stop healing and go Shadow? I'd assume you could always have them spec back and forth depending on what you need for the encounter, but dropping massive respec fees to be a sometimes-hybrid doesn't seem worth it.<br>
<br>
That's my only real gripe with the situation.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">You may very well be right, but these numbers don't prove anything.  It's practically impossible to infer threat from WWS info - there are any number of reasons that you could have taken more hits than anyone else that don't have any correlation to you having as much OT tps than other classes.  Also, given the lack of another OT class in the data, there's no comparison to be made at all.<br>

I'm not saying that you're not telling the truth, but scientifically, your data doesn't establish facts to back up your conclusions.</div>

</div>Exactly, showing one example when we have no idea how well the rest of your tanks performed, on a fight with a randomly avoidable knockback tells us pretty much nothing. <br>
<br>
Last night I ended up tanking VR on a friends warrior account for our first kill as it happened. We had a new warrior that had far worse threat then either me or our other warrior (I play warrior about once every 3 months when our MT is out for a few days). The reason is simply that he didn't understand that as an OT you nearly never use heroic strike and must make sure you have the rage to shield slam on every cooldown (devastate in between) and was unwilling to learn. In the end we had to swap him for our feral druid who had much better threat then either of us warriors but ended up tanking the boss for not much longer then us - because the amount of time you end up tanking VR is mostly related to how many knockbacks you take which is ultimately down to luck in such a small sample size as one fight.<br>
<br>
Now if you showed me the info on a gruul fight where you outhreat a warrior who is using shield slam on every cooldown and not wasting rage on heroic strike when he's rage starved that may be an actual comparison.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I've often wondered / marveled at the TPS cycles warriors use on Void Reaver.<br>
You can easily achieve 1500+ TPS using nothing but heroic strike and sunder, stopping only to berserker rage poundings. A 1 hander and a shield is hardly ever optimum for OT threat generation.</div>

</div>Void Reaver is a terrible example, because a paladin with a few mana pots should be tanking 50% of the time due to massive threat generation. On a fight like Gruul, yes, paladin OT threat is vastly inferior because they aren't taking enough damage to not go OOM.<br>
<br>
What does a prot paladin do when not tanking Morogrim adds? The same thing a prot warrior would do, except with JoW being kept up. I think the crux of the problem is that we're as role-inflexible as warriors while lacking their single-target tanking flexibility.</div>

</div>Similar to what Rikki said really, 2 caster groups imo is not needed, our melee DPS comes out on top on 90% of fights, While Elemental shaman are good, why take 2 when you could take a enhancement shaman?<br>
<br>
You resto shaman is completely wasted he gets nothing back from that group, swapping the resto shaman with the one in caster group 2 and having him respecc to enhancement  (gear permitting ofc) would mean, they all give and recieve buffs to their entire group.<br>
<br>
Caster group 2 loses 3% hit/crit, but aff lock and sp dont really benefit from it anyway since they will be hit capped (should be) and primarily use dots.  BM hunters need melee groups dont they? (could be way off the mark with that.)<br>
Melee group gains, SOE/WF (always placed without risking your healing shaman missing some heals) and UR.</div>

<br>
Given the moonkin would still do respectable dps, while giving the pallies 5% spell crit (afaik still worth alot of mana/5sec to them) and keeping an improved fairy fire up?<br>
<br>
I kinda got the feeling people underestimate moonkins:<br>
- They're dps is not bad anymore, and they did kinda lose the "oomkin" title<br>
- they have nice mana regen talents in their balance tree, so even tough their heals wouldn't be that great, they could sustain casting heals for quiet some time<br>
- Improved fairy fire, this is one of the best debuffs in the game, none of your rogues/fury warriors will be hit capped atm, so they should gain quiet some dps (for my fury warrior i once calc'd it at around 2%). Not to mention your maintank also gains 3% hit and i've not really seen that much tank gear with +hit, so if your MT is below 8% hit imp FF is an easy way to up his TPS.<br>
<br>
The interesting thing is you can put a moonkin into any group and they'll add something, even in a healer group.</div>

<br>
Most guilds raid with 7-8 healers. You will want 4 shamans and 3-4 paladin for all buffs, but you also want at least one holy priest for improved divine spirit and prayer of mending and 2-3 druids (1 tree and at least 1 other who is not tanking) for combat ressurections and because rolling lifeblooms are awesome. (Our restoration druids destroy healing meters in any fight that doesn't favor chain heal but contains splash damage.) Now, how do you fit all that into the 7-8 healing slots? You can't, so you will either roll with a non-optimal buff coverage or use some buff classes for alternative roles. It's your choice. <br>
<br>
My server, for example, lacks skilled people. When we reduced our healing section, we had the choice of either kicking two skilled people out and tell them that they can take their raid experience and scram, or swap to balance and retribution. Of course, it depends on the people you have.</div>

You resto shaman is completely wasted he gets nothing back from that group, swapping the resto shaman with the one in caster group 2 and having him respecc to enhancement  (gear permitting ofc) would mean, they all give and recieve buffs to their entire group.<br>

Caster group 2 loses 3% hit/crit, but aff lock and sp dont really benefit from it anyway since they will be hit capped (should be) and primarily use dots.  BM hunters need melee groups dont they? (could be way off the mark with that.)<br>

		<div id="post_message_409648">As a raid leader I find the most difficult balance to be the melee DPS group because optimization of it is so inflexible and it is not possible two have two optimal melee dps groups.<br>
<br>
Ideal group for us is War/Roguex2/Enh/Feral - because we run with 2 feral OT's.   Now maybe a Ret Paladin would be great in that group,  but a Ret Paladin is an inflexible 5th member of the group who offers no additional value (Brez,  Innvervate,  OT)  The second feral we run with we try to slot in with the hunters,  we also try to slot in a shadow priest with the hunters.  So that group would be something like Feral/SP/Hunter/Hunter/Hunter.<br>
<br>
Now where do I put the theoretical Ret Paladin?  He has absolutely no where to go where his buffs are an advantage or where he is capable of gaining buffs to make him valuable to the raid.<br>
<br>
Since rogues have zero group buffs,  you pretty much always have to stack them into the same party,  so in a 3 rogue raid you have to bump one of the 3 buffers for the 3rd rogue and try to give someone else a better benefit which the buffer you move,  this would generally be the feral to a tank group most likely.    I find it hard to convince myself that more than 2 rogues is ideal IF,  all dps is top tier.    Perhaps if rogues could give a group buff that had some effect positively on both mana/nonmana/physical/nonphysical dps there could be more options on where the melee classes or a 3rd rogue might go.    <br>
<br>
We try to stick to the model of 3x7 2x2 class balance for fairness,  but we often end up with 4 priests(2shadow min),  or 4 paladins(all holy).   We would never run with 4 of any other class if the choice was available to us.  Four rogues,  generally,  is almost suicidal in that it slaughters any kind of class synergy that you might be able to generate from your raid composition.<br>
<br>
<br>
Summary: I hate the inflexibility of the melee dps group,  there are plenty of perhaps not ideal,  but workable group setups for mana DPS groups.   I.E.  Mage/Lock/SP/Hunter/Shm etc.  or Huntx2/SP/Lockx2</div>

</div>JoW: 50% chance on attack or spell to restore 74 mana. <br>
<br>
Maintained properly, this works out to a minimum 8000 mana per minute for the raid. For classes like mages and hunters, this buff up on a boss is a *godsend* for sustainability. And you flat-out will NOT have it up unless you have someone refreshing it constantly. And unless you are running with lots of spare paladins, you won't be able to spare a healer to run in there and constantly re-judge or attempt to "melee".<br>
<br>
I would put JoW at the same level as an innervate, and possibly as good as a BRez (situational). If you're looking to increase raid dps, this is a *great* way to do it -- more mana for your mages and hunters means more aggressive rotations, which means more dps. And this doesn't even touch people like boomkins, ele shamans, enh shamans (who rarely have mana issues, but still). <br>
<br>
Additionally, a ret paladin can maintain JoL which helps mitigate a lot of the small splash damage that people can take on a typical fight. JoL on Morogrim would pretty much restore an entire melee group to full health before the next earthquake. Etc, etc.<br>
<br>
I think it's time we started spreading the word that ret paladins *do* bring raid buffs which are on the level of a druid; I know that if I had the option between an extra druid in my raid and a ret paladin, I'd choose the ret paladin. The first Brez and Innervate are great; the second are situationally good; the third useful, but less critical. And if you're having a feral druid *tank* something, neither of those buffs are usable, unless somehow the mob the feral is tanking dies and frees them up.</div>

</div>It's a fallacy that non-ret paladins can't use judgements - sure they may not be up 100% of the time, but with a Ret paladin one crusader strike "miss" will mean judgements falling off and the other pala's having to reapply theirs anyway. We have no problems with keeping JoL up 80% of the time, and in most cases it's more worth the paladins time doing it than healing because of the amount of raid healing it cuts down.<br>
<br>
Ferals are perfectly able to combat res. Just last week, while "offtanking" on Sharaz (not quite hateful strike, but kinda similar) I was able to both combat res and innervate in between. I've done it plenty of times on Gruul too. Tanking one of the mobs during the illidari council, again I both combat ressed and innervated. It's not a tough thing to do, you just have to be careful about it (which is true of healing druids too as it's a 2 second window where you aren't doing anything but ressing, it's a hefty mana cost, and it sometimes requires moving a significant distance from where you should be). <br>
<br>
Ret/Prot paladins are "just" another DPS/tanking class which you need to remake your raid around, similar to Moonkins (unless you're having a serious problem getting 3 holy paladins for blessings). <br>
Enh shamans take the place of the resto you would have in that slot anyway and provides slightly better buffs. <br>
Ferals provide offtanking aswell as LotP/innervate/CombatRes. <br>
<br>
The fact that both ret and prot paladins as well as moonkins have itemisation issues along with lack of people playing those classes to a high level merely compounds this issue.</div>

</div>There is many classes who benefit from a 4th blessing. For example, hunters, tanks, all hybrids. You run a restoration and feral druid in the same raid? Then one of them will want blessing of might and the other will want wisdom. DPSing ferals will want salvation, tanking ferals will want light. Unless your paladins just love managing 5 minutes blessings in 20 minutes encounters, a 4th class blessing is very useful. More attack power on the tank equals more threat generation, which is a DPS boost for the whole raid.<br>

</div>For that to happen, you need to miss two crusader strikes in a row. For a hit capped attacker the chance on that is 1 in 10000 and it is very easy to reach the hit cap for two-handed weapons.</div>

		<div id="post_message_409699">Actually in most raid encounters the travel time to the boss mob alone is enough to make it worth bringing a Ret pally to the boss unless you really want to absorb the massive melee AE damage and ridiculous effects most boss mobs have.  Sure it sort of works but it's still an inefficient use of healer time on an effect they can hardly afford to spend the time keeping up.  It will eventually come down and it will eventually kill you if you try for 100%<br>
<br>
It's much, much more efficient if you just get your Ret pally if you have one to do it.<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
Regarding Sanctified Crusader,<br>
I just don't buy +3% crit as being +3% damage, even with the modifiers crit can bring.  It's a pretty big assumption for a spreadsheet to make and try to 'prove' how much dps a class brings to a raid.  Rogues have the majority of their damage being autoattacks.  They can talent 230% damage on special attacks, and can talent extra combo points on special attack crits.  They also can talent +30% backstab crit.<br>
<br>
I just fail to see the math that would make +3% crit rate increase take a combat dagger rogue up to 4.6% more damage.  The same goes for combat fist/mace/sword.  Especially when we expect him to be only increasing by 2.4%.<br>
<br>
It's early, after I wake up I'll have to relook at glance/hit/crit tables and how they change dps.  But my gut says 4.6% is very high when I assume 70% rogue damage is autoattack and only critting at 200%.  Special attacks would have to be massively increased to pull that up.<br>
<br>
<br>
The larger the percentage of your critical damage is to your total damage, the less +1 crit matters to damage increase, barring crit synergy.  So I think glances would further lessen the effect that an increase of +1 crit gives (until you start pushing glance off your combat table).</div>

</div>Moonkins give 5% spell crit to their group, and Imp Faerie fire brings 3% melee hit to the raid.<br>
<br>
3% melee hit is a very very nice boost to DW meleers who deal with a 19% miss rate or so (white attacks only of course). Very few rogues will be at +19 to hit and those that are would benefit by being able to slot in some extra crit or AP armour pieces.<br>
<br>
Even so, on my rogue at the peak of raiding I was at around 16% +hit, I think if the choice was either a feral in my melee group or a moonkin in the raid, I would choose the feral. I guess it really depends on what you have and what you lack as well as the gear of your raid. I also still find moonkins to be oomkins.</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->Hey Cromfel, nice work. In your spreadsheet (the one that deals with a melee + caster dps group). There is a slight error in the Paladin Melee DPS contribution (cell I19). The formula is correctly attributing the benefit to the 4 other melee dps in the paladins group, however when it comes to the sanctified crusader increase, it is only including the 4 'fixed' members of the caster group and not including any bonus from the 5th hybrid/non-hybrid person, thus showing a lower melee dps contribution than it should be.<br>
<br>
The same is true of the moonkin in the caster group, as it's faire fire beneft is only including the 4 'fixed' melee dps'ers in the dps group.<br>
<br>
Might be worth changing the paladin/moonkin dps contribution assuming the other group is a non-hybrid group (otherwise their contributions are being based on 8 other people when there are in fact 9.</div>

		<div id="post_message_409772" class="post_message_underline">There are a couple of things about healers in general and restro-druids in particular, which struck me in this thread.<br>
<br>
Shamans are put in the MT-group regardless of the spec for extra threat through WF-T. Threat generation rarely has been a problem for my guild since MC. We always put a Restro-Druid (me) in the MT-group, which adds about 200 +healing. (MTGrou: MT1, MT2, druid, pally, warlock) Also we bring only 1, rarely 2.<br>
<br>
(we also have a hard time recruiting high-attendance shamans, I have to admit.)<br>
<br>
Healer groups are pointless unless paladins/priests/druids do not have a shadow priest or a restro-shaman (manatide), or everyone has its weapon enchanted with spellsurge. (Aura of concentration for some specific encounters). We aim to bring 2 shadowpriests, one being dedicated to the healer group as a mana battery. One of our Holy-Priests is rerolling to Restro-Shaman to fill another spot in the healer grouo. Shadow+Resto-Shaman+3xother healers +1-2 Healers in other groups (usually paladin being with the feral Tank, when he is offtanking.) Adding up to 7-8 healers. Sadly not always 3 Paladins, but a lot of priests.<br>

The optimum for the BM of course would be, enh shaman/feral druid+dps warrior+MM-hunter+shadowpriest, but if you had to pick one the mana gained from the SP surpasses all other buffs, especially if you gear towards it (items with tons of AP/crit/agi/some hit, but no/low int/mp5), the constant healing on the pet coming to that. Also the BM hunter is a viable addition to a caster group since on many encounters he gives back a 3% dmg buff (flat, from all sources) almost permanently, while his pet is critting the boss.</div>

Also I try to convince one of the other priests to spec shadow. First of all we are raiding usually without shamans (we have 2 with extremely low attendance), and adding one (no matter the spec) certainly adds to raid-flexibility (agi-totem for MT comes to my mind here).

Same was added to moonkin to have average of 5th member in melee group benefitting from the IFF.<br>
<br>
I have been rounding downwards on many places to make the numbers look just a bit smaller than they really would be, just to stay on safe side since it would be huge work to calculate actual benefits that different specs give. I think rounding down this way gives pretty good estimation, as the crit effect should on average give more than the given 3% dmg increase to many classes.<br>
<br>
If someone can prove trough calculations that the crit wont increase minimum of 3% dmg on average, I will be more than happy to fix it. Until then I will have to use the current information and by that using +3% for sanctified crusader is atleast the increase what it brings.</div>

<br>
There is many classes who benefit from a 4th blessing. For example, hunters, tanks, all hybrids. You run a restoration and feral druid in the same raid? Then one of them will want blessing of might and the other will want wisdom. DPSing ferals will want salvation, tanking ferals will want light. Unless your paladins just love managing 5 minutes blessings in 20 minutes encounters, a 4th class blessing is very useful. More attack power on the tank equals more threat generation, which is a DPS boost for the whole raid.<br>
<br>
For that to happen, you need to miss two crusader strikes in a row. For a hit capped attacker the chance on that is 1 in 10000 and it is very easy to reach the hit cap for two-handed weapons.</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->You could argue the opposite that having a 15minute wisdom on a feral is a waste.<br>
<br>
I dont want to sound harsh but theres so many people justifying an extra 'x' in the raid by making one job easier. <br>
For example, giving ferals salvation and giving light to the tanking feral is solved simply by putting the paladin on druid salvation healing that tanking feral. <br>
<br>
In my opinion the only 4th blessing to make <i>enough</i> difference to an entire raid is the luxury of having Blessing of Light on everyone(with the opera libram), which increases a paladin's raid healing by 20%+ and this is obviously only an advantage if everyone is taking damage.</div>

I'd really love to see some kind of quantification between pre-2.1 consumables and the use of correct class combinations, because my hunch is that they are in the same order of magnitude.  The difference is that the former is a huge time and gold resource issue, but the later is about having the right people always available.  Both are pretty big issues for a casual raiding guild to overcome...</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->I think your on the right lines but people definitely over emphasise the importance of hybrids, for example 'D&amp;T' dont raid with feral druids, we could quite easily do without our elemental for a raid (we do quite often), bar messing around in SSC we would never think of taking a moonkin and finally until our warriors get over their angst we wont have a ret-a-din geared enough to bother seeing how long it takes to rip on a boss.<br>
<br>
Your last point is probably a server specific one more than anything or maybe even a faction problem.  Horde have no shortage of paladins really, lots of people wanted a better pvp healer - lots of people wanted blessings in their raids.  As for alliance, some are suprised when they have to kill shamans twice.</div>

He mentioned moonkins, protection paladins, and ret paladins specificially.  We may THINK he's also saying feral druids, elemental shamans, and enhancment shamans are sub-par, but we do not know that.  Furthermore, the argument for feral druids and enhancement shamans is pretty strong.</div>

I wanted to make another point but first: Yes, you're correct. they've used both elem and enhanc shamans at times.<br>
<br>
My point: Gearing up hybrids is alot more risky than gearing up primary classes since they are more likely to change, quantifying this is hard but if it's only 3.2% improvement like in the op's example it would be a pretty easy chooice for me atleast.</div>

		<div id="post_message_409899" class="post_message_underline">Ignoring the synergy hybrid classes can bring is just silly if you're trying to find an easy way to boost your raid's dps.  I'm sure it works for some guilds to bring pure classes, but the overwhelming majority of WWS parses I see show that most guilds bring way too many tanks, healers, etc.  There isn't a single fight in all of SSC/TK that needs more than 1 prot warrior, yet some guilds use 4.  Feral druids can do the same tanking job 90% of the time while being able to DPS quite well when they're not needed to tank, as well as provide lotp to a 3 hunter/sham/druid group.<br>
<br>
The fact that DPS warriors/enh shaman can produce 1000+ dps (gear) while enabling rogues to hit 13-1500 dps is invaluable.  Plus, a DPS warrior can throw on resist gear and tank hydross adds, wrath of the astromancer, trash if someone's AFK, etc...basically anything that won't 1-shot with a crushing.<br>
<br>
If WWS has shown us anything, it's shown that many guilds manage to complete encounters with FAR less than optimal raid groups.  15m morogrim kills, etc.  The difference between raiding with 18-19k raid DPS and 10-12k raid DPS is staggering, and hybrids allow for a lot of the synergy in group buffs and task flexibility that create that kind of damage.<br>
<br>
The difficulty lies in the fact that sometimes collecting gear for a hybrid (as has been discussed) can be difficult, and people switching specs from healing might need a couple of weeks to collect gear, re-learn fights, dps cycles, etc.<br>
<br>
on another note, clearly all guilds rely on people to show up, and sometimes swapping specs or having someone reroll just isn't possible....and you're not going to tell your prot warrior with 100% attendance that you're booting him to recruit some unknown feral druid.  However, if you're building a guild or have a larger one with flexibility, there are certainly some great choices you can make in raid composition that will make things easier, and using hybrids is one of those choices.</div>

After reading the thread, I'm not convinced to fight for a moonkin spot in our raids either. Our casters would really be happier with a random shaman actually. Adding curse of recklessness and 1 more tank healer to the non-cor raid might increase the dps even more, and it wouldnt be more unrealistic either.</div>

 Moonkin especially are a class with tipping points between awesome and suck. On the playskill side there is just as big a learning curve switching from healing to ranged dps as there is switching from healing to tanking. In fact its probably bigger as great healers have more of a sense of aggro, what happens if they let that one mob loose for a second, etc that make them good tanks. There's a large chunk of initial theorycrafting work that makes a huge difference, I highly recommend just glancing at Efejel's spreadsheet in the class mechanics forum just to get a sense of what is possible, dps cycles, etc.<br>
<br>
  Gear is also a huge issue, and I understand the reluctance to allocate loot to the druid while playskill is in question. First the obvious- if the druid has 650 spell dmg cause they are only in leather while your mages are at 1000+ of course the druid will underperform. The more subtle point is that since base dmg is lower on our spells, a lot more of our "boom" comes with how we scale with gear. A moonkin at 1000 spell dmg is going to be a lot closer percent wise to a mage than a moonkin at 600 or 300.<br>
<br>
That being said, I agree with the hesitation to bring moonkins, an "average" moonkin doesn't bring something to the table the way even a bad shadow priest does. That's where the class needs the most help, it shouldn't be a "hard-mode only" spec.</div>

As raw equal damage doesnt seem to cut it for Moonkins and Retribution Paladins, what would be considered as sufficient addition to their toolset to make them seen as reasonable option?<br>

Or is the problem directly bound to shadowpriest and them being easily deployable on groups while their mana/heal regen doesnt suffer any penalty from having multiple Shadowpriests in raid?

		<div id="post_message_410166" class="post_message_underline">Raw moonkin damage is a lot closer to cutting it than ret pallys, if not cutting it already with equal gear. The problem more has to do with the fact that DPS is a dime a dozen, just cutting it isn't good enough when you have mages etc sitting on the sidelines. To be honest, my raw damage is fine, 80-90% of a pure class is where I should be, its the lack of group benefits/synergy.<br>
<br>
There are two very easy ways to fix moonkins desirability problems, even if it is stepping on shadow priest and elemental shaman toes (probably why they aren't in). Both are deep balance talent changes that would be a reason to have a balance druid rather than any druid and would make us directly competitive to the other two specs we are closest to.<br>
<br>
1. Improved moonkin aura based off of ILotP from feral, have spell crits return a percentage of mana. Kill's the rapidly untrue oomkin nickname once and for all, and brings to some classes a shadow priest like mana return.<br>
<br>
2. Have improved FF effect spells too if it is going to be in deep balance.<br>
<br>
<br>
I have no fraking clue what to do to help retribution pallys. IMO balance just needs a nudge, ret needs a complete overhaul. They really need help.</div>

		<div id="post_message_410263" class="post_message_underline">Not to knock on your work, but like you said in the op, I don't think this spreadsheet accurately shows much at all. The average dps of x class in y guild doesn't mean much, if you were trying to really model the gains/losses from hybrids you'd have to make up individual class spreadsheets (or use already existing ones), equally gear all the classes and figure out their max possible sustained dps and then do thew hole "switch out xx for hybrid" math. Alot of these numbers just seem really off to me and not a good way to prove/disprove something.<br>
<br>
That said though, from the bit I looked into it, I do believe completely optimal raids would include a ret pally and moonkin instead of that extra DPS warrior or mage. The possible individual DPS they can bring is much higher than most WWS logs can ever show due to bad gear/grouping. And I think the raidwide buffs/synergy they bring is also very fine as is, and nothing extra is needed to justify a raidspot for them.<br>
<br>
I think it's unfair to compare them to shadowpriests because the gains from a shadowpriest are just so huge you'd have to be very stupid to not take them. I don't think it should be that way, I don't think *forcing* people to bring these hybrids by making them so ridiculously good (like a spriest) but it's probably too late for that.<br>
<br>
I think the real reason why people don't raid with so many hybrids is just because like a few other people said, noone wants to sit solid members out of raids consistently to make room for such a small gain. Anyone that can do some basic numbers can tell you there's no argument that switching out a mage in full t6 for a moonkin in full t6 and cloth epics will result in a boss dieing quicker. But it boils down to is it really worth it? Speaking of my own guild, our regular melee group is a dps warrior, 3 rogues and a resto shaman. With the upcoming changes and crazy buffs I'm sure they'll give paladins I have no doubt it'd be a huge gimp to the raid to not take one... so who would have to sit... one of the rogues. These 3 rogues have been in the guild for a very long time, a couple from early naxx and one from the MC days. They're all very active and perfect at their class... so how exactly would that work? That's the real problem with hybrids IMO, it's just hard to fit them in the limited raid slots, regardless of the gain they give. Even with ret pallies the way they are now, I have no doubt the raid would be better off -1 rogue +1 ret pally, but I'd never suggest it just for that reason... I can't ever see anyone saying "hey let's get rid of one of our dedicated active members who has been with us for so long to make room for x hybrid that will increase raid dps by 1.5%!"<br>
<br>
I guess that is a problem with the class too. With shadowpriests, it was actually very worth i.t Not only do they bring a huge DPS boost from just misery+weaving, but the heal/mana regen utility is just so huge. I remember early BC days, on Gruul 1.0 progress when we tried out spriests to see their lvl70 utility. It was so crazy how much smoother a raid went when most of the people were still in Naxx gear/some kara epics. Taking 3 shadowpriests negated pretty much any healing required for 15 people, gave healers such an easier job than before, gave DPS like warlocks a boost more useful than 3 flasks stacked, etcetc. It was actually worth telling some of your raiders they would have to sit/rotate in and out/whatever for a shadowpriest because the benefit is so huge, it's just not worth it for the bit of DPS increase the raid would get from the other hybrid classes.</div>

Speaking from a bt/hyjal perspective, the threat output by tanks is just too high for anyone. On the earlier weak hitting bosses like najentus/supremus a tank can easily sustain 1500~ tps. On the later, harder things like Mother/Illidan it's very easy to sustain 2000+ TPS from pull to death (without a shaman). Unless your tank is bad at the game, threat isn't, wasn't ever and probably won't ever be an issue for any class on the large majority of encounters, regardless of threat reduction..</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I agree with almost all of Zeidrich's post.  Despite Prot paladins being labeled as a "hybrid" spec, a competent one can step up to the plate and go toe-to-toe with warriors and druids for tanking.  With decent spell damage (no, stacking warrior tank gear from Karazhan doesn't make for good threat generation whatsoever), threat becomes a non-issue.</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->This paragraph doesn't jive with the next one. "Toe to toe" with warriors and druids for tanking, then you go on to say "Personally I don't see Prot Paladins as being viable MTs". <br>
<br>
Well we most certainly aren't viable offtanks due to our limited raid role in any given fight. You can OT Morogrim adds - then what? Provide DPS with Avenger's Shield? Because you sure aren't healing with 400 spelldmg. Whereas a Druid can pick up mobs in DPS gear, tank at a fairly good percentage of what they would in real tank gear, then shift and DPS Morogrim. Same with Kael'thas - a Druid can DPS on the phases needed, and Tank on the phases needed - whereas a Paladin is just a big lump in Phase 4 and 5 in tank gear with abysmal regen and heals. <br>
<br>
Yes Paladins *can* do things, but on the same token we've had a 17k health Warlock tank a Bog Lord thingy in SSC. Just because you can do things doesn't mean they are optimal by any stretch - thus have no place in raiding. Also alot of the things you mention are just as possible with a Holy spec Paladin for the initial threat, then once AOE begins, just have the Warlock with the highest health click BoSalv off - and he can be the new tank.<br>
<br>
Ret Paladins with a threat reduction will be a viable raiding class just for the fact that they bring good DPS, another BOP, another DI, along with the option of keeping JoWis/JoL up on a target indefinitely barring dodges. Prot Paladins are shafted with the option of being the archetype with the most limited role in almost all given Raiding encounters - The Tank. And those fights where you need more than one tank, it is <b>always</b> better to have a class that can dual role like Druids, over another Prot Warrior or Prot Paladin.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">The problem with most EJ threads is that they are mostly based on pure theorycrafting. You don't have any hard facts to provide you with data aside from some wws reports from random ssc/tk guilds. Same stuff I see on shadowpriest forums, they have their most optimal talentspec and spellrotation, and magically think it's always the best. Just by looking at your group setup, I see that group 3 does not have a shadowpriest, while we in Nihilum have one. Don't you think that group you posted would oom in notime without a shadowpriest in it? Or didn't the theorycrafting go that far? Did you consider that melee is generally alot worse than casters on many fights? Did you consider the threat-management that non-resto shamans have when dps:ing? Or the lack of utility that a moonkin has when it comes to aoe and crowd control?</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->Pretty much.  It's spreadsheets removed from common sense and practical experience. <br>
<br>
To the author of that spreadsheet:  You have one shadow priest in a raid, and you're putting him in a group with two warlocks, a hunter, and a healer?  How is that remotely sensible?<br>
<br>
I think that in EJ we actually use hybrids a lot.  We do not have a moonkin, and we do not have a prot/ret paladin.  We do have multiple elemental and enhancement shamans, mostly feral druids, three shadow priests in a typical raid, etc.<br>
<br>
Group composition we've gone with recently might be something like this:<br>
<br>
<u>Group 1</u> (the tank group)<br>
Druid [Resto]<br>
Paladin [Holy]<br>
Warlock [Affliction]<br>
Warrior [Prot]<br>
Warrior [Prot]<br>
<br>
<u>Group 2</u> (the healer group)<br>
Paladin [Holy]<br>
Paladin [Holy]<br>
Priest [Holy/Disc]<br>
Priest [Shadow]<br>
Shaman [Resto]<br>
<br>
<u>Group 3</u> (the hunter group, aka "the Osse group")<br>
Druid [Feral]<br>
Hunter [BM]<br>
Hunter [BM or Survival]<br>
Priest [Shadow]<br>
Shaman [Resto]<br>
<br>
<u>Group 4</u> (the nuker group)<br>
Mage [10/48/3]<br>
Mage [10/48/3]<br>
Priest [Shadow]<br>
Shaman [Elemental]<br>
Warlock [0/21/40 Shadow]<br>
<br>
<u>Group 5</u> (the melee group)<br>
Druid [Feral]<br>
Rogue<br>
Rogue<br>
Shaman [Enhance]<br>
Warrior [Arms w/ Blood Frenzy]<br>
<br>
Can you see how there's more synergy here than in the spreadsheet example?  <br>
<br>
Now, the question is, let's say we want to fit in a moonkin or a ret paladin.  Where do they go?  Whom do we replace?  Do we drop down to 1 mage and want to kill ourselves clearing trash with one poly, or doing any fight that requires decursing (Archimonde, etc.)?  Do we drop a shadow priest and cause a group to be mana-starved?  Or if we want a ret paladin, where does he go?  Ret paladins need windfury more than arms warriors, and we only have one windfury group, so slots are limited.  Ret may have its uses, but if including one means forcing a rogue out of a Windfury group, that sharply cuts into any possible boost to raid DPS.  And so forth.<br>
<br>
(For what it's worth, the above 25 very closely approximates my "ideal" raid.)</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->That raid combination is by no means supposed to be optimal. It was made to see what kind of effect hybrids have. Thanks for your raid example, I will edit it to use that combination. I appology if I gave wrong impression of the raid combination. I tried to say that it was made from scratch. I did not see it necesary to arrange groups into optimal places as that is irrelevant when using average performance of all classes. Am I wrong if I say that it is irrelevant for the given example?<br>

Are they hard to replace with your guild roster? Most likely yes, since you are using the mentioned raid combination. But Lets say that Guild X could use that change. What would they loose and what would they gain?</div>

I think the worst thing for many hybrid builds is the 25-man raid cap.  If the raid cap were still 40, there's absolutely no question I'd have a ret paladin in every raid, for example.  The problem is that you have requirements in terms of fundamental raid roles like tanking, dispelling, interrupting, stunning, banishing, healing, etc.  You can't just say, "Ok, let's bring a ret paladin instead of a rogue" if that drops you down to one rogue, in most cases, because now fights that require interrupting, like Magtheridon, Solarian, Kael'Thas, Reliquary, etc., become unduly difficult if not impossible.  Maybe you increased your raid DPS by 1% by making that swap, which is pretty good, but if it means you wipe because you can't interrupt heals or nukes, that's not so good.</div>

		<div id="post_message_411607" class="post_message_underline">This thread gives me an idea for an addon, though -- I figure I'll stick it here instead of in the AddOns forum since it's probably just a dream.  But it might be interesting, if there proves to be a person/group that's up to trying to tackle this, to have a thread trying to hash out the logistics.<br>
<br>
Basically, imagine trying to build the ultimate DamageMeter addon.  It would go beyond what WWS can do in some ways, because it'd require in-game syncing and parsing of gear, talents, etc.; it would be cumbersome, and probably bandwidth-intensive, and probably not the sort of thing you run every day, every boss fight, and post meters for the raid.  But it'd answer some questions once and for all, and I bet it'd prove to be an invaluable tool to Blizzard's class balancing efforts too.<br>
<br>
In short, what if there were an addon that attempted to track not only personal damage, but every sort of synergistic buff that contributes to damage, in practice?<br>
<br>
Some of it would be really easy.  If I drop Windfury Totem, every time someone in my group gains a Windfury Attack, that damage is attributable to me.  If a warlock puts CoS on a mob, 10% (or more, with Malediction) of all shadow damage taken by the mob is attributable to him.  If a warlock procs ISB on a mob, the amplified damage from the next 5 attacks is his.  Simple.  <br>
<br>
Some of it would be trickier.  If a warrior Battle Shouts or I drop a SoE totem, that adds AP to the group.  The effects of that AP can be quantified -- a portion of the melee damage from every non-fixed-damage attack by the group will be attributable to that extra AP, based on the player's talents and use of skills.  If an elemental shaman drops Totem of Wrath, over the course of a fight, you can extrapolate from the benefits of the hit/crit totals for casters in his group, taking into account whether their gear/talents left them hit-capped to begin with, or how much benefit crits provide.  <br>
<br>
It'd be a massive project in scope, but wouldn't it be cool to see exactly how much a moonkin contributes to a group by his presence, which 5-person units have the most synergy and net output when taken as a whole, which debuffs on a mob really are the most valuable, etc.?  Just an idle thought.</div>

How about the mana gained from mana spring added to a group of nukers nuking until OOM?<br>
<br>
It is very interesting, what might be easier is instead of approaching it with exact maths to try to work with some optimization heuristics ala simulated annealing and try to test out various combination of groups and see what gives the most damage with very accurate simulations, then to maximise the possible damage. I don't think it would be too hard, but it might take a while to do.</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->I do understand what point you are making. And these are most likely case sensitive decision depending on boss you are fighting. But I could also say, what if the moonkin ressed 1 player who died for reason X? Or what if that Retribution Paladin use Lay on Hands at critical moment? Everyone have advantages, that can make or break the raid. You are absolutely right, that its impossible to add hybrids at some fights since the encounter cant be finished if you loose ability X from class Y. Im not suggesting that you should do so. Im merely pointing out that hybrids can replace some raid members if its possible for that given fight. <br>
<br>
I know that you have the knowledge to make those decision, and this topic is not here to lecture you how to build raids.

		<div id="post_message_411616" class="post_message_underline">It would be cool and I feel like people have been casting about for some measure like that for a while. It really is an immense project, though. Think of some of the "two-way" synergies for an idea of where extra complexity comes from. In your raid group above, the Osse group has "two-way" synergy. The Druid's LotP buff is going to increase the uptime of the hunters' FI buff, which in turn will increase the Druid's damage. Is the additional damage from the <i>extra</i> FI uptime attributable to the druid, or to the hunter(s)? Another issue is Vampiric Touch. Obviously it lets people 'cast more,' thus doing more DPS than they would otherwise, but how much more? Some classes will end up with more than 0 mana at the end of the fight, and thus it's hard to gauge just how much more they cast than they would have <i>without</i> the shadow priest.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I do understand what point you are making. And these are most likely case sensitive decision depending on boss you are fighting. But I could also say, what if the moonkin ressed 1 player who died for reason X? Or what if that Retribution Paladin use Lay on Hands at critical moment? Everyone have advantages, that can make or break the raid. You are absolutely right, that its impossible to add hybrids at some fights since the encounter cant be finished if you loose ability X from class Y. Im not suggesting that you should do so. Im merely pointing out that hybrids can replace some raid members if its possible for that given fight.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">This thread gives me an idea for an addon, though -- I figure I'll stick it here instead of in the AddOns forum since it's probably just a dream.  But it might be interesting, if there proves to be a person/group that's up to trying to tackle this, to have a thread trying to hash out the logistics.<br>
<br>
Basically, imagine trying to build the ultimate DamageMeter addon.  It would go beyond what WWS can do in some ways, because it'd require in-game syncing and parsing of gear, talents, etc.; it would be cumbersome, and probably bandwidth-intensive, and probably not the sort of thing you run every day, every boss fight, and post meters for the raid.  But it'd answer some questions once and for all, and I bet it'd prove to be an invaluable tool to Blizzard's class balancing efforts too.<br>
<br>
In short, what if there were an addon that attempted to track not only personal damage, but every sort of synergistic buff that contributes to damage, in practice?<br>
<br>
Some of it would be really easy.  If I drop Windfury Totem, every time someone in my group gains a Windfury Attack, that damage is attributable to me.  If a warlock puts CoS on a mob, 10% (or more, with Malediction) of all shadow damage taken by the mob is attributable to him.  If a warlock procs ISB on a mob, the amplified damage from the next 5 attacks is his.  Simple.  <br>
<br>
Some of it would be trickier.  If a warrior Battle Shouts or I drop a SoE totem, that adds AP to the group.  The effects of that AP can be quantified -- a portion of the melee damage from every non-fixed-damage attack by the group will be attributable to that extra AP, based on the player's talents and use of skills.  If an elemental shaman drops Totem of Wrath, over the course of a fight, you can extrapolate from the benefits of the hit/crit totals for casters in his group, taking into account whether their gear/talents left them hit-capped to begin with, or how much benefit crits provide.  <br>
<br>
It'd be a massive project in scope, but wouldn't it be cool to see exactly how much a moonkin contributes to a group by his presence, which 5-person units have the most synergy and net output when taken as a whole, which debuffs on a mob really are the most valuable, etc.?  Just an idle thought.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">That raid combination is by no means supposed to be optimal. It was made to see what kind of effect hybrids have. Thanks for your raid example, I will edit it to use that combination. I appology if I gave wrong impression of the raid combination. I tried to say that it was made from scratch. I did not see it necesary to arrange groups into optimal places as that is irrelevant when using average performance of all classes. Am I wrong if I say that it is irrelevant for the given example?<br>
<br>
Edit:<br>
<br>
Group 4 (the nuker group)<br>
Mage [10/48/3]<br>

Are they hard to replace with your guild roster? Most likely yes, since you are using the mentioned raid combination. But Lets say that Guild X could use that change. What would they loose and what would they gain?</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->Now you have one warlock in the raid.  You lose a destruction warlock that crits a lot and keeps ISB on the target, adding tons of damage to every DoT ticking for your 3 spriests and one affliction warlock.  You lose the ability to have more than one curse on your target, which will have a significant impact.  You lose CoS and your remaining lock and 3 spriests do 10% less, you lose CoE and your mages do less (much less than the moonkin adds for them), or you lose CoR for all the physical DPS in the group.  You're down to one soulstone, one type of healthstone, and one banish.  One player with a reliable single-target fear.<br>
<br>
You gain:  Moonkin Aura damage for those 4 players, and an effective 3% +hit from Imp FF, another battle rez, another decurse, and someone who can cyclone things if needed.<br>
<br>
Again, I don't have numbers, but I'm pretty sure that that's a very large net loss.<br>
<br>
The Ret paladin vs. Feral argument is a much closer call, to be fair.  I agree that the DPS and utility benefits of sustained judgments, etc., outweighs Imp LotP for that one group.  But you basically lose someone who can be a serious tank in most situations, and while that's a nonissue for many boss fights, if you aren't building your group just for a boss, but for a whole zone, then the extra feral druid helps a lot.  Lose him, and now your DPS warrior will have to tank for most of the trash.</div>

		<div id="post_message_411644" class="post_message_underline">Mostly the problem with writing an addon like Gurgthock suggests above is figuring out who to credit; there are two reasons you try to go for 'stacking' a group with as many buffs along the same lines as possible. The first reason is simply because each individual ability you add is an excellent increase to the people in the group, but the second reason is that the whole is greater than the sum of it's parts.<br>
<br>
Windfury Totem by itself is good, adding Leader of the Pack and Battle Shout makes it even better. And I could name a few more examples like this, including simply mixing the ability names in the previous sentence. This basically makes the calculations required extremely complicated, especially since you're reverse engineering the benefit, which tends to be more difficult than calculating what the benefit would be in, say, a spreadsheet.<br>
<br>
Part of the level of complication lies in determining really what kind of DPS should be attributed to whom; simply only calculating the DPS any single buff provides to a group isn't entirely accurate. You'd probably end up with a lower result than the actual DPS provided because the buff was combined with a number of other buffs, while it's also hard to determine what part of the DPS should be attributed to whom. If we take a group that has Windfury and Battle Shout, should all extra attacks through Windfury be credited to the Shaman, or should the damage provided by Battle Should be credited to the Warrior as well? That's a relatively simple example as well.<br>
<br>
Let's take crit buffs as an example, a Retribution Paladin provides 3% extra crit to both spells and physical damage. This would mean that as long as a Retribution Paladin has Judgement of the Crusader up, part of the extra damage provided by talents like Improved Shadow Bolt would need to be added to the Retribution Paladin as well, as well as the extra damage better Flurry up time would give to Fury Warriors and Enhancement Shamans, and the extra Clearcasts Elemental Shamans get and... Well, you get the idea. And that's not even mentioning the additional complication of a person already having such levels of crit that the 3% extra crit the Retribution Paladin is providing does not make a difference for such talent ability up times.<br>
<br>
Plus there's a fair amount of inexactness; even the client of the Priest casting Prayer of Mending has no way to know if there are multiple Prayers of Mending going around which are the ones of the Priest beyond the initial cast.</div>

		<div id="post_message_411650" class="post_message_underline" style="min-height: 183px;">We use a moonkin very frequently, including on our recent first Vashj kill. He's an exceptional player and frequently finishes in the top three on the damage meter in most fights. <br>
<br>
For reference, this is his armory: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111108165125/http://armory.worldofwarcraft.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Stonemaul&amp;n=Sapphiron" target="_blank">http://armory.worldofwarcraft.com/ch...ul&amp;n=Sapphiron</a><br>
<br>
He takes the spot of a mage, and save for fights where you need an extra polymorph..he really brings more utility and more dps to a fight than another mage would. The moonkin aura, extra battle rezz, and innervate have saved the day more times than once. Moonkin is a very hard class to play well and can be difficult to properly gear especially given the stigma against the spec, but given the opportunity in the hands of a skilled player it really brings alot to the table and an utterly astounding amount of damage, particularly when combined with the thunderfury debuff and CoS.</div>

Also, raid make up depends on your guild right...something that is effecient for your guild might not be for another...for example we brought 6 rogues to our first VR kill and did fine...I really dont think there is one perfect raid make up, just depends on what your raid favors....if you favor melee dps bring the hybrids that boost melee dps...if your raid is ranged dps strong bring those hybrids...this way there is a huge dps boost.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">You just completely ignored my point about what the warlock brings to the raid.  Dropping from two Curses to one and losing consistent ISB procs is going to reduce raid dps by far, far, more than what a moonkin might add.  The numbers aren't even close.  You're talking probably 600+ lost raid DPS completely aside from the warlock's personal damage.</div>

		<div id="post_message_411675" class="post_message_underline">I think one of the most interesting side effects of the 25 man switch is how rigid it has made groups. Back in Naxx we ran with 6-7 Shaman all resto. From week to week the people in my group were fairly random. <br>
<br>
In TBC the individual group dynamic is very interesting and very important. In the last dozen raids I think I have only grouped with 6 maybe 7 different people. But at the same time you get a better feel for the group and I think it makes you play more efficiently. <br>
<br>
A drawback though is that it is more difficult for the offspec guys to find a home. If you provide raidwide buffs it is hard to find a home in a group that is not really wanting to sit someone. <br>
<br>
If you provide only group buffs (shaman) you have an easier time selling yourself as you can provide a distinct advantage to your group.</div>

		<div id="post_message_411686" class="post_message_underline">In terms of the problem with buff interation that chicken mentioned, 'the sum being greater than that of it's parts', the "easiest" way to do it would be to calculate the classes base dps with only their own buffs, calculate their dps with each buff that would effect them, calculate their dps with all buffs, and then split the extra damage between the buffs based on a ratio of their effect. For example.<br>
<br>
Paladin dps with self-buffs = 800<br>
Paladin dps with Battle shout = 900<br>
Paladin dps with LoTP = 850<br>
Paldin dps with BS+LoTP = 1000<br>
<br>
Here BS provides 100dps, LoTP provides 50dps and there is the interaction adding 50dps<br>
Thus BS contribution = 100 + 50*(100/150)<br>
and LoTp contribution = 50 + 50*(50/150)<br>
<br>
It wouldnt bee 100% accurate, but a fairly reasonable estimate.</div>

Sure it sort of works but it's still an inefficient use of healer time on an effect they can hardly afford to spend the time keeping up.  It will eventually come down and it will eventually kill you if you try for 100%<br>

It's much, much more efficient if you just get your Ret pally if you have one to do it.<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
Regarding Sanctified Crusader,<br>
I just don't buy +3% crit as being +3% damage, even with the modifiers crit can bring.  It's a pretty big assumption for a spreadsheet to make and try to 'prove' how much dps a class brings to a raid.  Rogues have the majority of their damage being autoattacks.  They can talent 230% damage on special attacks, and can talent extra combo points on special attack crits.  They also can talent +30% backstab crit.<br>
<br>
I just fail to see the math that would make +3% crit rate increase take a combat dagger rogue up to 4.6% more damage.  The same goes for combat fist/mace/sword.  Especially when we expect him to be only increasing by 2.4%.<br>
<br>
It's early, after I wake up I'll have to relook at glance/hit/crit tables and how they change dps.  But my gut says 4.6% is very high when I assume 70% rogue damage is autoattack and only critting at 200%.  Special attacks would have to be massively increased to pull that up.<br>
<br>
<br>
The larger the percentage of your critical damage is to your total damage, the less +1 crit matters to damage increase, barring crit synergy.  So I think glances would further lessen the effect that an increase of +1 crit gives (until you start pushing glance off your combat table).</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->Moonkins give 5% spell crit to their group, and Imp Faerie fire brings 3% melee hit to the raid.<br>
<br>
3% melee hit is a very very nice boost to DW meleers who deal with a 19% miss rate or so (white attacks only of course). Very few rogues will be at +19 to hit and those that are would benefit by being able to slot in some extra crit or AP armour pieces.<br>
<br>
Even so, on my rogue at the peak of raiding I was at around 16% +hit, I think if the choice was either a feral in my melee group or a moonkin in the raid, I would choose the feral. I guess it really depends on what you have and what you lack as well as the gear of your raid. I also still find moonkins to be oomkins.</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->Hey Cromfel, nice work. In your spreadsheet (the one that deals with a melee + caster dps group). There is a slight error in the Paladin Melee DPS contribution (cell I19). The formula is correctly attributing the benefit to the 4 other melee dps in the paladins group, however when it comes to the sanctified crusader increase, it is only including the 4 'fixed' members of the caster group and not including any bonus from the 5th hybrid/non-hybrid person, thus showing a lower melee dps contribution than it should be.<br>
<br>
The same is true of the moonkin in the caster group, as it's faire fire beneft is only including the 4 'fixed' melee dps'ers in the dps group.<br>
<br>
Might be worth changing the paladin/moonkin dps contribution assuming the other group is a non-hybrid group (otherwise their contributions are being based on 8 other people when there are in fact 9.</div>

		<div id="post_message_409772" class="post_message_underline" style="min-height: 183px;">There are a couple of things about healers in general and restro-druids in particular, which struck me in this thread.<br>
<br>
Shamans are put in the MT-group regardless of the spec for extra threat through WF-T. Threat generation rarely has been a problem for my guild since MC. We always put a Restro-Druid (me) in the MT-group, which adds about 200 +healing. (MTGrou: MT1, MT2, druid, pally, warlock) Also we bring only 1, rarely 2.<br>
<br>
(we also have a hard time recruiting high-attendance shamans, I have to admit.)<br>
<br>
Healer groups are pointless unless paladins/priests/druids do not have a shadow priest or a restro-shaman (manatide), or everyone has its weapon enchanted with spellsurge. (Aura of concentration for some specific encounters). We aim to bring 2 shadowpriests, one being dedicated to the healer group as a mana battery. One of our Holy-Priests is rerolling to Restro-Shaman to fill another spot in the healer grouo. Shadow+Resto-Shaman+3xother healers +1-2 Healers in other groups (usually paladin being with the feral Tank, when he is offtanking.) Adding up to 7-8 healers. Sadly not always 3 Paladins, but a lot of priests.<br>

The optimum for the BM of course would be, enh shaman/feral druid+dps warrior+MM-hunter+shadowpriest, but if you had to pick one the mana gained from the SP surpasses all other buffs, especially if you gear towards it (items with tons of AP/crit/agi/some hit, but no/low int/mp5), the constant healing on the pet coming to that. Also the BM hunter is a viable addition to a caster group since on many encounters he gives back a 3% dmg buff (flat, from all sources) almost permanently, while his pet is critting the boss.</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->I updated the spreadsheet and image to have average of the 5th caster dps increase.<br>
Same was added to moonkin to have average of 5th member in melee group benefitting from the IFF.<br>
<br>
I have been rounding downwards on many places to make the numbers look just a bit smaller than they really would be, just to stay on safe side since it would be huge work to calculate actual benefits that different specs give. I think rounding down this way gives pretty good estimation, as the crit effect should on average give more than the given 3% dmg increase to many classes.<br>
<br>
If someone can prove trough calculations that the crit wont increase minimum of 3% dmg on average, I will be more than happy to fix it. Until then I will have to use the current information and by that using +3% for sanctified crusader is atleast the increase what it brings.</div>

<br>
There is many classes who benefit from a 4th blessing. For example, hunters, tanks, all hybrids. You run a restoration and feral druid in the same raid? Then one of them will want blessing of might and the other will want wisdom. DPSing ferals will want salvation, tanking ferals will want light. Unless your paladins just love managing 5 minutes blessings in 20 minutes encounters, a 4th class blessing is very useful. More attack power on the tank equals more threat generation, which is a DPS boost for the whole raid.<br>
<br>
For that to happen, you need to miss two crusader strikes in a row. For a hit capped attacker the chance on that is 1 in 10000 and it is very easy to reach the hit cap for two-handed weapons.</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->You could argue the opposite that having a 15minute wisdom on a feral is a waste.<br>
<br>
I dont want to sound harsh but theres so many people justifying an extra 'x' in the raid by making one job easier. <br>
For example, giving ferals salvation and giving light to the tanking feral is solved simply by putting the paladin on druid salvation healing that tanking feral. <br>
<br>
In my opinion the only 4th blessing to make <i>enough</i> difference to an entire raid is the luxury of having Blessing of Light on everyone(with the opera libram), which increases a paladin's raid healing by 20%+ and this is obviously only an advantage if everyone is taking damage.</div>

I could say druids suck in TPS, paladins can do easily 2000 TPS! In fact i just did it =P<br>
Claiming those numbers without any underlying base though does not make them viable at all.<br>
<br>
Actually we just found a 973 TPS warrior, his raw damage output is amazing. Too bad it's anonymous, armory would have been interesting.<br>

</div>If you play with a competent, well-geared druid, you quickly find that it's all but impossible to pull aggro from them in an infinite/high rage situation, sunder or no sunder.  Though I always keep sunder up if needed of course.  The half afk comment was in reference to the fact that druids do it with 3 skills only.  Mangle, maul, lacerate.<br>
<br>
You might reference the fact that threat for skills between druids and warriors is similar, however druids frequently enjoy a 30%~+ crit rate in full tank gear and have no problem generating rage while having nearly 50% dodge buffed.  It's also easy for druids in T5 to hit the armor cap while maintaining all of this.<br>
<br>
I don't have a screenshot of TPS numbers, and clearly there is no 100% reliable source to get those numbers from.  Omen is pretty buggy and is frequently updated/changed anyway.  Anecdotally, I can say that nobody in my guild has ever had threat issues with a feral druid tank on trash or bosses, and on my druid alt (quest rewards + kara loot) I've held aggro over 12-1400 dps players with no salv on fights like curator and prince, and especially curator isn't an infinite rage situation.  Sure it's not the greatest evidence, but it counts for something.<br>
<br>
I realize these aren't hard numbers, and they don't speak to warrior threat directly, but it's certainly how it always feels.  I suppose it's possible our warrior tank has some problem with his gear or threat rotations.</div>

</div>I used to think that, too.  After testing and theorycrafting, the 3rd rogue gains more from the totems than the rest of the group does from lotp.  We usually have 2 groups like:<br>
<br>
Fury<br>
Enhance<br>
Rogue<br>
Rogue<br>
Rogue<br>
<br>
Feral<br>
Resto Sham<br>
BM Hunter<br>
BM Hunter<br>
BM Hunter<br>
<br>
Though lately one of the hunters has gone back to MM, he likes it and his dps is high so...it's fine.  Sometimes when a hunter doesn't show up, we put a 4th rogue or a 2nd warrior in this group.  What I wonder is...warrior in hunter group with WF vs. dps gain for the rest of the group from AGI totem.  <br>
<br>
EDIT: I'm sure the hunters gain a lot, esp with crit based abilities, but I wonder just how much.  Also, our hunters have never requested a shadow priest...they claim not to have mana problems.</div>

My lighting bolt average damage from DM meter (count in crit to average out) be 2200-2400. divide by 2 secs is already 1100 dps +,  and I have excellent mana efficiency (count in crit give 60% reduction, my lighting bolt is like 210 mana per).

</div>Your dps is not as simple as taking your average damage and dividing by your raw cast time.  The average person will suffer a .3 to .4 additional seconds to every single cast simply because of ping (even if it's as low as 30).  Stopcast will remove some of that, but never all of it.  A more realistic figure would be +.2s (if you are really pro and practiced with stopcast) to every spell.  Dropping your figures down to a little over 1k.  Then you have to figure losing several GCD's for totems/lust, etc.  Hence 900.  Show me a log of t4/t5 elemental shamans doing over 1k consistently and I'll edit my numbers.  PS, the EJ log with t5/t6 shamans with double bloodlust barely breaking 1.1k doesn't count. ^^</div>

</div>Well if you guys have some data how much threat your skills do it is easy: get a WWS parse, sum up threat skills, damage done and self-healing and calculate the total threat. Then divide by the length of the fight and you have a realistic TPS number.<br>
<br>
I don't know if people realize this, but 800 TPS is worth 1600 dps of a class with ~50% threat reduction (salvation + passive modifier/range modifier), which actually is approximately what top dps classes sustain in our raids atm. 1600 TPS would equal in 3200 dps, which is an astronomic value. If tanks would really <i>sustain</i> this amount of TPS, no one would ever come close to them in threat meters.</div>

</div>My gut tells me Imp SB, depending on how many Locks you have specced into that in the raid (as you get more and more locks, it gets closer and closer to being more beneficial to the Frost Mage).  Reason being - the Frost Mage provides 0 utility with his spec (Arc/Frost, mind you, not WC), while the Warlock provides utility with his Imp SB procs to himself, other Warlocks, and Shadow Priests.</div>

I don't know if people realize this, but 800 TPS is worth 1600 dps of a class with ~50% threat reduction (salvation + passive modifier/range modifier), which actually is approximately what top dps classes sustain in our raids atm. 1600 TPS would equal in 3200 dps, which is an astronomic value.

</div>Ranged classes never seem to have trouble with threat in straight fights, and they all have some sort of threat reducing skill if it does become a problem (except elem shams i guess).   Also, the range modifier is an absolute number, meaning you must exceed 130% of the current theat value of the mob's target to pull aggro.  Salvation reduces threat generated by 30%.  You're talking about two different mechanics and adding them together.</div>

</div>I'd have to say it really depends on the fight too. On Void Reaver, I am out of mana very, very fast. On Gruul, I generally have little issues because I can regen a little more during Ground Slams. As the fights progress and from I've seen to grow in length, mana will become a huge issue for a hunter that is trying to maximize DPS. But without turning this in to a hunter DPS discussion...<br>
<br>
Maybe I'm biased as a hunter, but my guild favors putting the SPriest with the fire mage(s) and Moonkin and putting a feral druid in groups with the melee players. The first I understand, but the latter upsets me especially in cases where we can completely optimize group set ups. Usually we're averaging high 7k up to low 9k raid DPS which I find to be better than previous as we were doing 6.5 to 7 if lucky. I'll just have to keep pushing for better group make ups to push for the 10k, then the 11k, and so on and so forth.</div>

		<div id="post_message_414222" class="post_message_underline">Our normal caster dps group is <br>
<br>
Fire Mage<br>
Fire Mage<br>
Shadow Priest<br>
Elemental Shaman<br>
Destro Lock<br>
<br>
But the other day we had a glut of mages and warlocks and two shadow priests.  Since I can reach the hit cap without the totem (sacrificing about 40 damage and .5% crit) I volunteered to go into the second shadow priest group.  It was pretty nasty in that group with<br>
<br>
BM hunter<br>
Feral Druid<br>
Shadow Priest<br>
me (fire mage)<br>
and a random Holy Paladin<br>
<br>
The synergy of that group was really nice, as the devotion aura, ILotP heals and VE heals kept the hunter pet alive, while LotP helped keep Ferocious Inspiration up pretty much non stop.  Add in the fact that 4/5 people in that group were getting a good bit of mana from VT and our damage (as a group) rivaled the caster powerhouse group with the elemental shaman + shadow priest.<br>
<br>
As a fire mage my main concern is getting the shadow priest.  I usually get the elemental shaman too, since hes a 100% attendance guy, but sometimes I'm the odd man out because I have so much more hit gear than everyone else so I get to fend for myself.  As far as what I would like for a third hybrid, I almost would prefer to have a BM hunter instead of a Moonkin, especially if the VE heals will be enough to keep the pet alive.  Maybe that's just my bias against Moonkin because I haven't been impressed with any that we've tried out so far (note: I know what they're capable of, its the players behind the screen that I'm actually biased against, not the class or its capabilities).<br>
<br>
I guess what I was trying to get at with this rambling post is that if you can get the group to support a BM hunter, try it out.</div>

</div>The problem with this becomes group synergy.  Do you bring 3 hunters a feral druid and a resto shaman, or 3 hunters a shadow priest or a feral, or 2 hunters a shadow priest, resto shaman and feral.  Dropping the shaman isn't remotely realistic.  The dps gained from 2 hunters replacing steady with multi or arcane a few times isn't going to come close to the dps lost from a third hunter vs shadow priest. Well, looking at your wws logs, it will since your hunters seem to do very similar numbers to your shadow priests.  Ours are worlds apart from each other however.  At very best a shadow priest in the above group is going to do 800-1000 dps on most fights (no wrath of air), but a hunter at best could do 1500 (if BM with imba scorpion, if not then like 1200-1250?) and provide the other 3 dps with 3% more damage.  The two other hunters switching to multi/arcane more often isn't going to come close to that difference.  Of course the shaman would lose a slew of free chain heals, but generally we only have a single shaman spamming chain and the second on the MT full time for ancestral fort which would be the shaman in the hunter group.  <br>
Any way you swing the group, it's an overall loss of dps.  Unless you simply don't have hunters who sport high numbers and you have shadow priests that do.<br>
<br>
On the note of hunters and crit, the best reason they want the GoA and LoTP so much is the ravager (if they bring one).  Currently the ravagers special has no cooldown and as such it can be spammed so long as there is available focus.  Crits generate focus... you can see where this is going.  The scorpid however seems to do way more dps even on fights where you can't roll 1k ticks for 7M+ and the extra focus is of minimal concern here.  Scorpids doing 600+ dps by themselves on Morogrim is a bit ridiculous though.  I wonder how many fights in BT/HJ would allow for some pro scorpid numbers.</div>

</div>It's simply not that easy.  Just about every fight in TK/SSC has downtime or transitions that would skew TPS.  Everyone one except Morogrim.  I've never tanked Morogrim  simply because our prot warrior would have nothing to do if I did.  We both have mage alts however, perhaps next week I'll have him bring his for aoe while I tank and we'll compare the wws and TPS to his the last few weeks.  Some real TPS numbers from actual logs would be nice to have though, or perhaps there is already a thread someplace with this in it?</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">On the note of hunters and crit, the best reason they want the GoA and LoTP so much is the ravager (if they bring one).  Currently the ravagers special has no cooldown and as such it can be spammed so long as there is available focus.  Crits generate focus... you can see where this is going.  The scorpid however seems to do way more dps even on fights where you can't roll 1k ticks for 7M+ and the extra focus is of minimal concern here.  Scorpids doing 600+ dps by themselves on Morogrim is a bit ridiculous though.  I wonder how many fights in BT/HJ would allow for some pro scorpid numbers.</div>

</div>The reason they want GoA and LoTP is because they boost damage better then battle shout does.<br>
<br>
Also scorpids have claw, wich is a focus dump just like a ravagers gore.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">It's simply not that easy.  Just about every fight in TK/SSC has downtime or transitions that would skew TPS.  Everyone one except Morogrim.  I've never tanked Morogrim  simply because our prot warrior would have nothing to do if I did.  We both have mage alts however, perhaps next week I'll have him bring his for aoe while I tank and we'll compare the wws and TPS to his the last few weeks.  Some real TPS numbers from actual logs would be nice to have though, or perhaps there is already a thread someplace with this in it?</div>

We have opened a new thread about sustained warrior TPS, since it's off topic in both threads. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110510001727/http://elitistjerks.com/f31/t14130-warrior_sustained_tps_wwsed/" target="_blank">[Warrior] Sustained TPS / WWSed</a><br>
<br>
If you can get us some druid numbers, feel free to contribute. I don't know how much endgame stuff is tanked by druids, but fights which should show some comparable numbers are: prince, magtheridon ph2, given WWS parses are available.</div>

		<div id="post_message_414613" class="post_message_underline">Speaking as an enhancement shaman, I'm obviously biased. However I'm pretty much in the camp where if you can justify your raid slot with intimate knowledge on how to wrest the best out of your class and also provide an increase to the effectiveness of your party then you get that slot.<br>
<br>
Also as of late, less and less specs are becoming off-specs. Certainly Feral Druids, Enhance Shamans and Shadow Priests have made good names for themselves in TBC. Unfortunately O do agree that Moonkin and Ret Paladins are under par in comparison to other 'off-spec' characters. Not by a lot but enough for those classes to be picked over them. Both specs really need a look at and it will be interesting to see the results once they are. I cant speak about prot paladins in raids as I've barely even had one in 5 man groups =O.<br>
<br>
Anyway, in regards to my opinion of the Perfect Raid, here is my ideal build.<br>
<br>
EDIT: Spacing isn't correct. Will correct in the morning.<br>

Warrior   Fury		        (Imp Battle Shout, Imp TClap, OT #4 if needed that bad)

<u>Caster Group</u>

Preist 	   Shadow	    (VT)
Mage 	  Deep Fire

Warlock	 Destruction	   (Imp SB)

<u>Healer Group</u>

</div>This build supplies <br>
* 2 Tanks with up to 3 more when needed.<br>
* 7 Healers, including 2 Resto Shamans for Chain Heal. Up to 2 additional healers can be added by benching the Enh Shaman in the Melee group for a Resto Shaman, and also by Benching the Feral Druid in the Hunter Group for any Healing Class.<br>
* 16 DPS, 13 of which are Dedicated. Split between 6 Melee and 10 Ranged.<br>
* Maximum Synergy to Gain ratio in DPS groups. (The melee group could go to 3 rogues at the cost of the druid which is higher DPS but i prefer having a 4th OT)<br>
* 3 Blessings<br>
* 4 Bloodlusts / Heroisms<br>
* 2 Curses<br>
* Only 1 Affliction Warlock + 3 Shadow Priests so less chance of debuff loss to DoTs<br>
* 4 'Off Spec' Characters.<br>
<br>
So yes, its my opinion that in building the Perfect Raid you definately need to use Hybrids, or Off-Spec classes, whichever you prefer to see them as. Just not all off them are equally viable in their contributions in comparison to a pure class or another hybrid. As I said earlier it will be interesting to see what Blizzard does to give Ret Paladins and Moonkin's more viability. If they get around to that before the next expansion anyway.</div>

		<div id="post_message_414864" class="post_message_underline">Bit freakish but had to go somewhere. My guild runs with 4-5 shadowpriests per raid. We're kinda mocked a lot for this. Tend to split them 2/2/1+shaman. The DPS and effective healing can be good on a lot of fights. 40 Debuff slots are a real issue though and our 3-4 affliction locks have probably noticed this.<br>
<br>
Maintaining a roster of this many shadowpriests was a pain, but the ability to gear up an alt to "tier 5" standards with craftables somewhat covered for this. We run with 2 mages/2 rogues a raid, and usually 1-2 hunters too. It's kind of annoying in some respects - recruiting new people for an automatic raid spot when we have 2-3 rogues, 1-2 hunters, 1 Holy priest, 1-2 resto druids, 1-2 mages on standby, some of whom are long term members.</div>

		<div id="post_message_415280" class="post_message_underline">Two shadow priests make a world of difference for arcane mages.  I would much rather have 3x arcane mage 2x shadow priest then 3x mage 1x elemental shaman 1x shadow priest.  AB is by far the highest dps spammable ability in the game, and also the highest cost.  I can certainly see why healers like to have shadow priests, but I just don't see it as necessary, at least not with our healers who I tend to think are nothing short of phenomenal.  We tend to keep light up at practically all times though and I make sure every single one of our healers is chain chugging pots, not just half of them half the time.  <br>
If a guild has a couple under-performing healers, or every single one of them isn't chain chugging pots I can easily see a shadow priest for their healers being the deciding factor in certain fights.<br>
<br>
Battle shout will improve TPS more then LoTP will, but I agree there is no reason to bring two prot warriors to anything in TK/SSC, I can't speak for HJ/BT yet.  I think the main reason people do, is simply because they have 1902380219 (+/- 5) prot warriors from 4 horsemen still kicking around.  That and the fact dps warriors aren't exactly stellar beyond one in a raid.  I also doubt many guilds default tank gear to a druid and they simply don't notice how powerful they are very early in progression if this is done.  <br>
<br>
Also, 5 shadow priests in a raid is a casters worst nightmare loot wise.  The best thing about switching from mage to druid was the total lack of competition on loot, as opposed to say a third of the guild all wanting the same items.  I really don't even want to think about being in a situation like that again.</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->It depends on how many healers you run.  I've always liked giving healers shadow priests and bringing fewer healers.  Yeah, if you have 8, everyone should be fine except maybe on a fight like Gurtogg where you're just spamming a lot.  But try raiding regularly (all fights in SSC, all fights in TK, pretty much everything except Gurtogg and Archimonde so far in t6) with 6 healers, and it doesn't work if you don't give them shadow priests.  <br>
<br>
Literally, with a shadow priest I heal as much as two healers without.  One of the major reasons I like enhancement shamans is that it frees me up to get a shadow priest.  And no, I don't use a shadow priest to save gold -- I drink mana pots like water regardless.  It just gets translated directly into higher sustained HPS.</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->You're looking at it from the wrong angle.  Your healers can have much greater sustained HPS - you can probably bring one less healer and one more DPS.  That, of course, is a very quantifiable DPS gain.  <br>
<br>
Shamans in particularly greatly benefit from being able to cast as many max rank CH's as they can in a lot of fights.  CH is just so good.<br>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->In general it's best to give the healers your third shadow priest, not your second.  Assuming the last group is Mage, Warlock, 2nd Shadow Priest, I would do this:<br>
<br>
Move G5 Shadow priest to G4, move G4 Feral Druid to G1, Move G1 Resto Shaman to G5.<br>
<br>
Now your casters have totem of air at the cost of tank group totems, which are not that useful.  Your other DPS group (hunters) have a shadow priest too.  And all the tanks have imp, at the cost of crit for the hunters.  A shadow priest with Vampiric Embrace to keep pets alive will offer much more than a feral druid though.<br>
<br>
Now if I could cut only one healer for a third shadow priest, I would cut the three druid from group 3 for a third shadow priest.</div>

Also, an estimate of "800-900 TPS" as what a tank should be doing is simply wrong.  My personal experience suggests something closer to 1200 TPS sustained as what a tank in t6 content should be doing.  <br>
<br>
On a fight like Teron, where the mob has next to no armor, and there's tons of incoming damage, I can definitely see 1500ish.  But no, I don't know that I've seen or had reason to expect 1500+ as a standard on random bosses or hard-hitting trash mobs with ordinary armor values.</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->Is that 1200 TPS with or without a Shaman in the MT group for Windfury, out of curiosity?  I noticed that your ideal group lineup didn't have a Shaman in the MT group, and since my raid typically has 4 Shamans as well (2 Resto, 1 Elemental, 1 Enhancement) I'm considering moving one of the Resto Shamans out for a Tree Druid.  Do you find the boost from ToL to be noticeable?<br>
<br>
We're also finally getting a second active Shadow Priest, so the next question becomes whether he should go with the healers:<br>
<br>
Shaman (Resto)<br>
Priest (Shadow)<br>
Priest (Holy)<br>
Paladin (Holy)<br>
Paladin (Holy)<br>
<br>
or the Hunters:<br>
<br>
Shaman (Resto)<br>
Priest (Shadow)<br>
Hunter<br>
Hunter<br>
Druid (Feral)<br>
<br>
We also run rather light on healers, so based on your other comments I'm going to start him off in the healer group.  We have an excellent BM Hunter right now, Crzed:<br>

Stack all your healers on top of your 3-4 shamans and that's a ton of MP 5 on top of a SPriest regening them. Then there is the Paladin buffs, they'd never know what "OOM" was again. Certain abilities like TSA would be semi understandable, but still shouldn't really matter considering the decline in MM and increases in both BM and Survival. If they shortened the range of them, I could see that being a decent change, but the gameplay could possibly change drastically and make it harder for some classes than it would to ease issues.<br>

Also the requirement of group optimization in TBC raiding often means that the choice between sitting one player vs another comes down to which one I can't fit into an optimal group. If I have my war/enh/rogue/rogue/rogue group, set up, the performance loss of taking another melee class is large enough that I'd often rather sit them to pick up another caster instead.

Have every boss cast Veil of Shadows (-75% healing debuff)?  It's a Curse, so you'd be SoL with that setup.  I can think of a lot of fights where having 20 Shadow Priests and 5 Tanks would still end up wiping.<br>
<br>
But yes, if you made these kinds of things raid-wide, I think a drastic reduction in the range of the abilities would be called for, and probably make the game a tad more interesting, if a bit annoying at first glance.</div>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->I think it's a bit of a double-edged sword, personally. I like the idea of group-based synergies and the meta-game of maximizing group performance, but I really dislike the fact that it further stratifies guilds of varying experience. Particularly when certain setups/buffs are <i>so</i> much better than others.<br>
<br>
It's an added hurdle to entry-level raiding, and yet one more thing that aspiring raid leaders need to learn. Likewise, it places added pressure on recruitment/class load, rather than player skill and coordination. Additionally, there isn't any particular place where you learn to optimize raid groups (other than forums or forum-readers passing it on), and it takes the control of a player's performance out of their immediate hands. None of these things are really conducive to entry-level and/or casual raiding, and while I very much appreciate the fact that I can add a ton to my group-mates, it's frustrating when raid leaders set up groups in much the same way they would 5 separate 5-man groups.</div>

		<div id="post_message_415771" class="post_message_underline">One issue I do have with min-maxing the raid compositions is that it causes a bit too large of a gap between those who understand it and those that do not.  Now, since I am myself quite interested in the mini-game, I probably shouldn't mind too much but for game balance it can be a problem.  <br>
<br>
I've seen far too many guilds that just make little 5-person groups that would be better suited to running an instance alone than they are for raiding and they are hurting themselves greatly.  In one sense that's fair enough but typically such guilds are already struggling for a lot of other reasons already and this gap in addition is a bit heavy perhaps.  I wouldn't want to see a situation where a guild was discouraged on an encounter simply because they never clued into using windfury for their rogues.<br>
<br>
It's far too late to change things now though I expect.  A few reasonable tweaks might be in order though to allow some things to span the raid more easily.  Extending Blessings and *some* totems might be a good place to look at the start.</div>

		<div id="post_message_415783" class="post_message_underline">I would agree. It takes a lot of experience to perform the job well. It requires experience with the players just as much as experience with theorycrafting and min/maxing raids.<br>
<br>
I don't see it as much of a problem for entry-level raiding though. In KZ, it's almost hard to go wrong with only two groups. The DPS/healing required is also minimal compared to T5 instances, so you don't need to always have windfury on the melee or a shadow priest in with the healers. As soon as you hit Gruul, efficiency becomes an issue, but not before then.<br>
<br>
edit: @ Northerner<br>
Dumbing down the process of raiding any more than they did with the alchemy-nerf would just further diminish the epic feeling of it all. If no one in the guild knows how to use windfury propperly, then you should slow down and learn the game before you progress (or are allowed to progress).</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">In general it's best to give the healers your third shadow priest, not your second.  Assuming the last group is Mage, Warlock, 2nd Shadow Priest, I would do this:<br>
<br>
Move G5 Shadow priest to G4, move G4 Feral Druid to G1, Move G1 Resto Shaman to G5.<br>
<br>
Now your casters have totem of air at the cost of tank group totems, which are not that useful.  Your other DPS group (hunters) have a shadow priest too.  And all the tanks have imp, at the cost of crit for the hunters.  A shadow priest with Vampiric Embrace to keep pets alive will offer much more than a feral druid though.<br>
<br>
Now if I could cut only one healer for a third shadow priest, I would cut the three druid from group 3 for a third shadow priest.</div>

	</tbody></table>
</div>
<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->I tend to almost never bring a second shadow priest, and I only do when we don't have enough mages/warlocks online, which lately has been every night.  I always want to bring at least 5 aoe, preferably 6 to any instance.  Ideally that would be 2x mage 4x warlock.  <br>
Moving a shadow priest from group 5 to 4 would have him losing out on totems (if group 5 gets them that night), our mages losing like 250-400 dps each from not being able to spam AB, and would cost our hunters a lot more then 5% damage each, as well as cost the druid a good 15-20% dps from loss of FI and loss of improved totems.  While the pets would then get VE, they would lose LoTP.  Then you would have double stacked ferals in group 1 providing no benefit, and no shaman in the tank group which is a huge loss of agro and avoidance (a lot moreso if you have ferals tanking often as we do).  <br>
So our total raid dps would go down by well over 1k, but to make up for that we can drop our 7th healer for a less then 1k dps shadow priest.  No thanks.<br>
<br>
Beyond that, 7 healers have higher burst HPS then 6+shadow priest, and often times that counts for a whole lot more then sustained HPS .  <br>

<!-- END TEMPLATE: bbcode_quote -->I wouldn't call these fights good for multiple prot tanks.  You can use a prot warrior sure, but I don't think there are any advantages to doing so, unless you are simply subbing prot warriors in/out for other classes on every boss.  Hydross can be easily tanked by any tanking class with greens.  Karathress adds are all easily tanked by anyone really except the shaman who would ideally be tanked by a feral (lack of crushings since he's 71).  Al'ar doesn't hit remotely hard enough to even matter who tanks it.  Void Reaver is ideally suited to ferals since they can generate way more threat while not being hit.  Solarian AR soaks can easily be non-prot warriors, and I'm at a loss for where you would even put a second prot tank on Kael that would make any real difference over a feral/paly.  <br>
Anyway, the point wasn't that second prot tanks are bad, simply that there is no need for more then one should you be in a situation where all you have is one (as we are).  More then two is probably hurting your raid more then it's helping, unless you are subbing.  In the event our prot tank isn't on I'm confident we could clear all ssc/tk without a single prot warrior, possibly even Kael (pyro 1m cooldown, barkskin 1m cooldown and I have way more HP, not sure if it would sync properly though).  You don't have to bring two is all I'm saying, and I don't even think you <i>have</i> to bring one.</div>

We'll accept for the sake of simplicity that Protection Warriors are the best all-around tanks in the game (I think they are).  At that point, you want to have more present for pretty much any fight where there is more than one mob needing tanks.  We'll ignore gimmicky stuff where Mages or Warlocks tank.  Given that a player is going to be needed to tank a specific mob and given that tanking will likely be their only contribution to the fight (and certainly their primary one), why wouldn't you use a Prot Warrior in that case if one was available?</div>

		<div id="post_message_415916">I have specific reasons.  I prefer to use ferals on the adds on Al'ar.  At the same time, the bulk of bear mitigation is in their armor.  Al'ar doesn't hit all that hard, but he hits hard enough on a bear with 20% armor that a taunt resist from the other tank can get very ugly.  <br>
<br>
On VR, obviously bears are good, but you may not have multiple bears, and with the incoming damage from the AoE, prot OT threat generation is pretty good.<br>
<br>
On Solarian, DS and IDS are pretty huge in mitigation damage as arcane soaks.<br>
<br>
On Kael, you need a warrior to tank Kael.  You really really want him to be prot for IDS and +hp to make Pyros safer.  You need a warrior to tank Sanguinar (unless you are dirty Alliance with fear ward), who can do nontrivial damage and can't really be tanked by someone in DPS gear.  And if you have a warrior in tank gear, they're not doing much damage regardless, and will likely be the dagger bitch for p4.  Conc blow is nice for that too.  Anyway, you probably don't want those two warriors being the same person, because unless you kill Sanguinar first, if something goes at all wrong, you may not have him down by the time Kael pops up, and that would be very bad.  So yes, I'd favor two prot warriors for all four of those fights.</div>

		<div id="post_message_415948">Part of it is raid makeup and which guilds have which players show up and play well.  We have 2 bears with 100% attendance, so VR always has 2 bears and 1 prot warr.  We've had the bear live through resisted taunts, but really it's rough on either class, and considering dodge rates on bears I'm sure it's equal enough to be trivial.  Warriors however, do have mocking blow in that situation.<br>
<br>
Talking to a friend on Illidan today (server illidan, and the guild is on illidan) they do solarian with zero AR soaks in DPS zerg fashion.  I've AR soaked without being prot for every Al'ar kill...it works just fine though of course is not ideal, but it's no more sub-optimal than having a 2nd prot warrior on morogrim, right?  Though, I believe all of our kills have had a 2nd dps warrior putting sunder up, which gets rid of rogues having to expose at minimal effort from the warrior...and more melee dps on that fight is always welcome.<br>
<br>
For Kael, we haven't had trouble getting both Thaladred and Sanguinar to die well before kael comes out, but having 2 prot warriors would allow for some more flexibility, plus the dagger bitch thing.<br>
<br>
Again, nobody said raids that have two prot tanks are stupid, just that it's not necessary and for lots of fights the 2nd one is pretty useless dps-wise.</div>

</div>Well I come from the standpoint that I really don't like to sub people out (except for cases where no one needs loot or someone needs to finish a quest or something).  I invite 25 people, and that's the 25 we raid with all night.  Given that a feral can near double a prot warriors dps when not tanking, while providing much more dps to various groups then a warrior can the clear choice is ferals and less warriors.  Not to mention an extra combat rez/innervate and the difference between an equally geared feral/prot warrior is very marginal at best for any sort of offtanking in TBC.  An extra prot warrior is akin to bringing a 8th or 9th healer... it might be safer on healing but you just run into other problems from having lower dps. <br>
I'm really surprised that there is such leeway in TBC with tanking, I had expected there to be a much larger need for warriors based on previous instance design pre-TBC.<br>

</div>I don't know about your ferals, but when I pop trinket I am just shy of the 75% evasion cap.  From what I hear the same cap is possible with warriors and some defense trinket, though I'm not sure of the specifics.  That and I have like 2-3k more hp, if anything I want our warriors taunt to resist rather then mine.<br>
As for Sanguinar, we split melee him ranged Thaladred (sp?) and both easily die about 1m before p4.  There is something to be said for a prot warrior being the MC breaker though.<br>
<br>
EDIT: I recall tanking Al'ar for a good minute or so with the debuff up when we were learning it and our prot warrior died.  At least I remember being convinced that I could fairly easily do it if it was needed and told the paladins to be ready, though the opportunity never arouse again.  Not ideal by any means, but manageable at any rate</div>

		<div id="post_message_416288">My guild's approach to raiding is not to minimize errors, but to reduce their impact. And especially feral druids (healing too, for that matter) perform really well with this mindset. Battle Res (+ Innervate) in case someone dies is just so nice. Or even the fact that he can take multiple roles, e.g. switching from dps'ing to tanking in if a tank gets disconnected or dies. It's not needed by any means, but as said: Druids allow more errors - and nobody's perfect.<br>
<br>
As Praetorian said, in SSC/TK are many fights that favor prot warriors over feral druids. But in Black Temple, at least in my opinion, this situation shifts in the complete opposite.<br>
<br>
The first fight, Naj'entus, only needs one tank, and every prot warrior standing around is only a burden to you, while a feral druid can inenrvate the stressed healers and dps the boss in the meantime.<br>
<br>
Supremus uses Hurtful Strike and a feral druid is superior for migating this damage. He/She can even give an Innervate to a healer or a shadowpriest while Supremus runs around shooting vulcanos. <br>
<br>
I cannot commend on Shade of Akama, as the fight bugged out for us and phase 1 was skipped completly, resulting in a 40second 1st pull "kill". <br>
<br>
The next fight's Teron Gorefiend: Again, you'll need only one tank and you shouldn't bring more, as at least our raid didn't have to much spare time left when finally killing him. On a sidenote, combat res will really help you in this fight when you didn't bring enough warlocks.<br>
<br>
The last encounter we killed in our very first week was Gurthogg Bloodboil. You want three tanks and all three must perform as much thread as possible. For us, feral druids seemed to be the best choice again. One prot warrior maintank and two feral tanks, to be more precise. During Fel Rage phases they could innervate our stressed healers, while doing perfect threat during his bloodboil stages. As far as I remember they even dps'd a bit during fel rage. <br>
<br>
Our conclusion: Up to Gurthogg Bloodboil (except Shade), you would not want to bring more than one prot Warrior while bringing more (two) ferals, and you only have to sub out some mages for healers/spriest on the bad red orc.</div>

DPS also increases a lot from taking the shaman in the tank group and giving him to the casters for wrath of air and bloodlust.  That alone will be more damage than Leader of the Pack could hope to provide.  Plus that group setup lets you swap the 7th healer out for a third shadow priest, which is clearly an increase in DPS without decreasing the amount of healing that can be done.</div>

</div>Have your mages spec arcane and spam arcane blast.  At best they will each do 400 more dps with two instead of one and they will do at least 250 more each.  There are numerous other benefits to arcane spec over fire spec as well, such as vastly higher burst with PoM + Pyro + AP, better sustained AoE with 9% more crit on AE and 25% more crit damage on it, the situational but very welcomed utility of slow, the ability to CoS aoe mobs for an additional 10 or 13% damage since it's not worth using two curses but CoS is worth it with every lock/mage using spells that are effected by it.  The only fights where CoS on adds is worth it is Hydross and Kael, but it helps a lot of Kael.  I suppose Al'ar if you use an OT/AoE strat as well.<br>
The top end dps of an equally geared t5 mage will yield around 1200ish for fire, and 1600ish for arcane, assuming infinite mana.  Spreadsheets put it at 1420 and 1880 respectively, but that's without lag. <br>
Also the best benefit, is that it keeps your mages awake since they have to put some to any effort into raiding what-so-ever with arcane spec.  I can't even count how many times a mage has pulled agro on Leo after WW because he simply zoned out spamming fireballs, and I know I'm not alone here.<br>
<br>
I've compared our hunter damage to random top 10 wws parses for every ssc/tk boss, and our hunters always match or beat the rest (excluding fights where our hunters have weird kiting/bat killing duties/etc), and they have never had a shadow priest.  My rudimentary math shows that raid dps will actually fall if they have one, and until I see even a single parse someplace blowing our hunters away I'm not going to bother to put any real time into the exact math, nor will they be getting a shadow priest.  In any event, the hunters are certainly not going to gain a 30% dps increase from a shadow priest like the mages, maybe 3% if they are lucky.</div>

</div>I confess I haven't raided on a mage in TBC content, but if I understand <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070921183421/http://elitistjerks.com/f31/t13190-mage_how_can_arcane_damage_work/" target="_blank">this thread</a> correctly, Fire still beats Arcane, and the reason Arcane might seem better is improper assumptions from the spreadsheets.  For example, if you input gear that's low on +hit, then of course Arcane will outperform Fire.  But the best Arcane gear with Arcane spec still loses to the best Fire gear with Fire Spec.  At any rate, I'll leave the technical arguments of Fire versus Arcane to Manly, but I will state I find both his arguments and his WWS parses very compelling arguments for Fire being better than Arcane.<br>
<br>
Regarding curses, Curse of Elements with only 2 mages is still a net benefit over curse of agony or doom, assuming equivalent gear between the mages and warlock.  Keep in mind that using Curse of Elements gives more time in which to cast Shadowbolt, because it doesn't need to be refreshed as much as agony or doom.<br>

</div>I'd suggest your hunters are only doing well relative to the casters because the casters don't have a shaman for Bloodlust and Wrath of Air.  To truly determine how well DPS is doing, you have to compare against other people of the same class in different guilds, not against other classes in the same raid.</div>

Also the best benefit, is that it keeps your mages awake since they have to put some to any effort into raiding what-so-ever with arcane spec.  I can't even count how many times a mage has pulled agro on Leo after WW because he simply zoned out spamming fireballs, and I know I'm not alone here.<br>

</div>I really don't see how chaincasting arcane blast for any extended amount of time would be possible, even with two shadow priests in a party.  With four stacks each cast is 1043 mana and a 1.5 second cast time.  That's 695.33 mana/second (or 3476 mana/5).  There's a lot of mana returned by having a shadow priest in your group, but it would certainly not be enough to sustain that kind of mana consumption.<br>
<br>
Plus, if your mages cant stay awake and NOT cast a fireball after a threat wipe that's not really a justification for having them spec into an inferior spec.  Other than fights with aggro resets, managing your threat as a mage is inconsequential, especially with paladin buffs.</div>

- dps who haven't gotten used to avoiding damage in the fight we're learning<br>

		<div id="post_message_421582">Depends on the fight really for that group.  Really, just have a resto shaman give up subtlety from their Resto tree or something and slap some points in Enhance for imp GoA so that the enhance shaman can go in the melee group. (unless you have an overabundance of enhance shaman or something)  But, unless the fight is shorter than 5 minutes or so your hunters will generally have mana issues if they are running a max damage cycle sans spriest.  <br>
<br>
Then again you have to run the numbers to see how much extra damage that spriest is giving to one group and the other on the fight.  For example, comparing two Teron kills where I was mana limited in one, 1400 DPS and change, to one where I wasn't, 1600+ DPS, and weigh that against your mage's output or how stretched your healers are.</div>

</div>Well, I think out of any possible group compisition, theoretically, this one gets the most benefit from a Feral Druid's aura. I'm not sure about other raids, but I often have a hard time placing Ferals where I feel their buff is optimized. Put them in the melee group, and a rogue or warrior gets bumped out. Put them in the tank group, their buff isn't being utilized efficiently. <br>
<br>
In the above group, there are 8 entities benefiting from the druid's aura. You put in a warrior, and you're forced to drop windfury, and then only 3 classes are benefiting from the warrior's battle shout. Originally, I was thinking it was a truly synergistic group, but to be honest, I don't think hardly any guilds run with more than 1 enhancement shaman. I don't have the heart to steal it from the melee. I also forgot how much of a DPS boost Hawk &amp; a Shadow Priest was for a Hunter.<br>
<br>
I think this would be best damage wise:<br>
<br>
DPS Feral Druid<br>
Shadow Priest (9% more dmg: 9% more mana!)<br>
BM Hunter X3 (9% dmg for 3 pets and 5 people!)<br>
<br>
You have a couple of wasted inner group buffs, but I think the Shadow Priest will provide more to the group than a melee's stolen enhancement shaman would.<br>
<br>
I'm a little curious how 9% damage for a druid compares to 381 AP, Anyone done the math?</div>

</div>I always voluenteer to be in a hunter group when we run feralx2 because the 9% amplifies well with the multiplicative bonuses of shred/mangle debuff.  This is even better on fights where movement is important as a lot of white hits will not land then and maximizing yellows is the key.</div>

		<div id="post_message_423495">With unleashed rage, improved shouts (commanding presence?) and solarians sapphire, BS actually ends up as:<br>
<br>
305+70 * 1.25 * 1.1 = 515 AP.<br>
<br>
If you consider a raid buffed druid to normally be at 4000 AP without BS and 4500 with, then it can be modelled as:<br>
<br>
1 speed weapon with 55 base DPS -&gt; (55 + (4000/14)) * 1.1 = 55+285 * 1.1 = 374. (55+285 + 500/14) * 1.1 = 413.<br>
DPS difference: ~9.5%<br>
<br>
Mangle = (160% + 264) * 1.2 = 1034 or 1110<br>
DPS difference: ~7%<br>
<br>
Shred = (225% + 405) * 1.3 = 1620 or 1734<br>
DPS difference: ~6.5%<br>
<br>
Rip = 3606 total damage at 4000 AP, 3776 at 4500 (taken from the Feral DPS thread)<br>
DPS Difference of ~4.5%<br>
<br>
Taking white damage as ~40%, Shred damage as ~32%, Rip as ~20% and Mangle as 8% then:<br>
<br>
0.4*9.5 + 0.32*6.5 + 0.2*4.5 + 0.08*7 = 3.8+2.08+0.9+0.56 = ~7.5% total damage difference. Assuming this, you would need to have either 2 BM and a MM hunter, or 3 BM hunters to be able to outdo battleshout at that level. Without the benefit of Solarians, it's probably safe to say that you can break "even" with 2 BM hunters alone.<br>
<br>
However, looking at how much of an impact BS has on a druid, if you don't have a shaman and your group setup is 3 hunters/SP/Druid, you will easily lose out on damage compared to having a shaman. SoE is ~245 AP without unleashed rage (talented), and then unleashed rage is another ~450-500 AP on top of that. Even if you were to be in a melee group with unimproved totems AND unimproved BS, you would still get ~500 AP which is comparable to the comparison made above.<br>
<br>
<br>
I know I haven't included naturalist in the special calculations but I'm not sure if it counts again - if it does its less than 1% difference for each ability in any case which would mean ~0.4% difference total in the end.<br>
<br>
Hopefully those calcs are right, trying to do it quickly in between bits of work ftl.</div>

		<div id="post_message_423922">Overall, if there is some source of "outside" mana be it a Shadow Priest or a Shaman's Totems, that is a lot of help. Even using Demonic Runes and various sized mana from Unstable to Fel Mana can not keep me high enough forever. The heavy kicker for a Shadow Priest is the health restored to our pets taking some small AoE damages so we can use that GCD for another steady, multi, or arcane instead of a mend pet. <br>
<br>
Arguably, wouldn't a resto shaman benefit a caster or healer group more assuming one is not there because of Wrath of Air totem plus the mana restoring abilities? The Shadow Priest would benefit in damage from every FI... If there is three BM hunters, that's 9% extra damage to him meaning 9% more health and mana restored too.</div>

</div>This change is basically a pvp change. Aspect of the Viper will still kill our AP, and prevent iAOTH procs (I hate iAOTH and don't use it, but that's a story for another thread). The new viper grants roughly enough mana when you're scraping the bottom of the barrel to maintain a steadyshot rotation (which is all BM needs). Ultimately it's another badly implemented bandaid for pve dps that will help a bit in arenas.<br>
<br>
As for your group makeup, the problem here is you're too focused on your hunter's individual dps. If you don't have a survival hunter in the raid somewhere you're kicking yourself in the nuts. (I give my raid 276 AP at the moment. That's 2/3rds of a second Bshout, and it's for the entire raid. tanks, melee, other hunters.) My personal dps is on par with any other hunter out there, but taking the raidbuff into account, it's pretty noticable when I'm absent. In addition to this, why waste the ferocious inspiration buff on this group? Take your second hunter and put it in a group with mages/spriest etc. FI is a much better damage buff than that of an elemental shaman in a caster group, and the BM hunter will never OOM with the spriest.<br>
<br>
If interested I can post our normal group makeups, they're considerably different from what I've seen posted here, but do wonders to maximize our specific makeup's dps. (We just have some strange class balances.)<br>

</div>We tend to raid with 0-1 hunters as of late (we did kael'thas last night with 0, haha). The one hunter that does raid from time to time is pushing ~2000 DPS. Can Survival really put out that much? (debuff included, of course)<br>
<br>
As for my thoughtful group wishing; just like any other raid leader, the idea of a group that buffs each with no drawbacks has always interested me. The reality is, whenever we actually have hunters, I tend to spread them out, and the main problem is that I feel they create something of a synergistic conflict with most groups I put them in. I have a hard time finding what group they work best with.<br>
<br>
For example, our 'caster dps' group usually looks like this:<br>
Shadow Priest <br>
Warlock<br>
Elemental Shaman<br>
Mage<br>
Mage<br>
<br>
and then, our 'melee dps' group:<br>
Rogue<br>
Rogue<br>
Enhancement/Resto Shaman<br>
DPS Warrior<br>
Rogue/DPS Warrior<br>
<br>
I could put a BM hunter in the caster group, but to provide the group with a 3% dmg aura (that is being taken from somewhere else), I'd have to sacrifice totems for a mage or warlock. Basically, it's not worth it. So what other options do I have?<br>
<br>
I often find myself putting them in our leftover group, which is usually something like this:<br>
Warlock/Mage<br>
Warlock/Shadow Priest<br>
Healer<br>
Healer<br>
BM Hunter<br>
<br>
As you can see, I feel that FI is being wasted most of the time, and I often find hunters stuck in healer groups, because there's just no where else to put them.<br>
<br>
I'm curious to hear as to what kind of group setups people are running, and what they're doing with them in regards to their hybrids.</div>

<br>
There is no downside to moving the resto shaman to the caster group.  In fact, this would let him drop WoA for additional damage and healing.  <br>
<br>
The enhancement shaman in the hunter group would add improved totems to the hunters and feral, and give unleashed rage to the feral and pets.  He would also receive benefit from ILOTP.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I think that the allocation of shadow priests depends heavily on the fight at hand.  For example, shadow priests for healers is amazing for Najentus but almost worthless for Supremeus or Akama.  There are plenty of examples of this and it's up to the raid leader to make the best decision at the time.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_446060" style="min-height: 183px;"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->As far as shadow priests and their assignments, let's assume you have two shadow priests, and anywhere from 6 to 9 healers. <br>
<br>
With 6 healers, 4 get a SP, because guaranteed, you'll have a tree druid and a resto shaman, both of whom should not be stacked in groups with other healers due to the utility of using them across the raid.<br>
<br>
With 9 healers, you could give 8/9 shadow priest-age ... but again, if you're running with 9, you're so low on dps that your mages/locks/hunters *need* SPs to make up the differential.<br>
<br>
I've found the key lies with giving one group of healers a SP, and spacing the others out around the raid. Your raid leader should have the ability to move people around ... put the people most likely to burn their mana in the SP group, and the rest can be swapped in as they drop.<br>
<br>
For example, we run with 7 healers on Morogrim Tidewalker. 4 are assigned to MT, 1 to raid heals (mostly melee + hunters, from earthquake), and 2 to "grave area" -- one healing our paladin murloc tank, and one covering graves. <br>
<br>
3 of the 4 MT healers and the paladin assigned to heal the murloc tank get the SP group. If the paladin who is the 4th MT healer gets low on mana, I switch him with one of the *other* MT healers who is highest in mana (from the SP group). <br>
<br>
The resto shaman who raid heals just covers himself, and when he drops his Mana Tide, we switch him into a group that can most use it before he does, just to avoid wasting it. <br>
<br>
Conclusion:<br>
- healer heavy, all SPs go to dps<br>
- healer light, most-&gt;all SPs go to healers<br>
- healer medium, split them half/half<br>
<br>

A couple of questions....<br>
<br>
When forming a melee group, what is THE optimal (most raid dps) group set up?<br>
-Enh Shaman<br>
-Rogue<br>
-Rogue<br>
-Warrior<br>
-(Rogue/War/Feral)?<br>
Wondering what the best choice would be for the last spot.<br>
<br>
And occasionally we do raid with a boomkin, for the good of the raid, should he spec into imp. faerie fire?<br>
<br>

</div>I wouldn't be so quick in making a call for IFF.<br>
<br>
What you have to understand is moonkin is very talent starved spec and asking for points in something that doesn't benefit him/herself severely gimps dps potential. Usually the moonkin would have to loose either 8% ~ 12% threat reduction or 20mp5 or a 12% spell damage coefficient. As you could imagine, losing any one of these would be devestating to any caster.<br>
<br>
Of course, once you get into BT and melee DPS dps skyrockets there comes a point where some serious discussion could be had, but at SSC/TK level IFF really isn't worth the points unless your raid is extremely physical dps heavy.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Worth considering.<br>

Actually I've settled with only 12% threat reduction and only 2points in IFF. I like having 4% resists<br>
<br>
12% threat reduction works nicely for ROS and if it works for ROS then I don't have to worry about it anywhere else.<br>

</div>I disagree. Moonkins become comparatively useless without Improved Faerie Fire and the moonkin aura. I don't see how 8%-12% threat reduction isn't enough for a moonkin druid when 10% is enough for an elemental shaman. <br>
<br>
You're saying that if the moonkin doesn't spec for the extra threat reduction, mp5, or damage coefficient over IFF you might aswell bring another mage, when in all actuality the situation is reverse. Without IFF and the moonkin aura we are absolutely better off bringing another mage or warlock.<br>
<br>
Also, your warrior comparison doesn't make sense. Here's a comparison that I think fits this situation; If arms warriors had to lose 2 points in Flurry in order to gain something like 2 points in Blood Frenzy would I ask my arms warrior to do so? Of course I would. Now obviously the arms warrior is going to benefit from their own Blood Frenzy, while the moonkin doesn't benefit from their own IFF, but in the end that really is meaningless.<br>
<br>
My reasons to bring a moonkin druid, ranked in order of importance: Moonkin aura and IFF &gt; Another combat rez &gt; Another Innervate &gt; Insect Swarm &gt; The damage they deal.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Given you have 3 hunters that you want them grouped together for synergy.  Would the best other two classes be to group with them for maximum DPS?  Either a Shadow Priest, Resto shaman or Feral druid?  Assume a 8 minute long boss fight.<br>

		<div id="post_message_465217"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->My hunters constantly tell me they prefer a feral over a shadowpriest, so in my case I have 3x BM hunter, Feral druid and Resto shaman, with that Shadow priest in G5. Potions are a good substitute for VT, but nothing matches LotP for 3 hunters + 3 pets.<br>
<br>
Having said that, in fights where pets continuesly take some AoE damage, a shadowpriest is obviously preferred.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Insect Swarm is more important than another Innervate, imo, at least to a raid, since most Moonkin will use their Innervate on themselves <br>
<br>
Aquan : Arkadu, I need an innervate, Sadris is tanking<br>
