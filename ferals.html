<br>
<u><b><font size="2">Introduction</font></b></u><br>
Due to the previous situation of having three (or four?) feral druid threads and another general one that has been taken over by ferals mainly, this post is meant to be a consolidation of all the knowledge that we currently have about feral druiding; what's good, what isn't, and what's new. As of making this, it's entirely a <b>Work In Progress</b>, so 'bear' with me (groan, etc). Hopefully by splitting into more than one post it won't hit the character limit too easily and there'll be plenty of space for additions and things.<br>
<br>
The structure of this multi-post is as follows:<ul><li> <b>Introduction post</b> - random stuff.</li>
<li> <b>The Cat Post</b> - DPS stuff.</li>
<li> <b>The Bear Post</b> - Tanking stuff.</li>
<li> <b>The News, Changelog, and Summary post.</b></li>
</ul><br>
Unfortunately the forum scheme isn't always the clearest for seeing links so (at least if I remember) I'll italicise all links.<br>
<br>
I'd also like to take the opportunity to thank both everyone who has ever done any work previously on druid theorycrafting and all those who are likely to contribute in the future. This post wouldn't be here without you.<br>
<br>
Feel free to use this post as the main discussion thread for feral druid stuff. I'll keep up to date with it and update the main posts with anything interesting to the population at large so that (hopefully) we have less posts of "is this item worth it?" or "so what IS powershifting?" and the like.<br>
<br>
Be warned that there is likely to be some opinion in the following posts. I'll try and keep opinion out as much as possible.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Making Posts</b><br>
Please please PLEASE read through this post and search this thread for information on any topic you're looking for before posting about it. If you don't and there's already information, people will probably be polite and point you to the relevant section, but it's much easier for everyone if you just search for it. At least check the main posts first. Ctrl+F is your friend and generally better than the search function on the forums in my experience.<br>
<br>
If you are asking about how good an item is, check the spreadsheets or Toskk's gear generator (DPS) or Rawr (Tanking). If you must post about it, use the  tags (without the spaces) to make it show up properly. It's much easier to have a mouseover than have to go to an external site. Most of the time people will just point you to one of the spreadsheets/simulator things anyway, so it's best off actually using them rather than expecting someone else to do it for you. Don't be scared about using them - if you screw something up it doesn't matter (although obviously if you get a result that you think is significantly wrong, question it with the author of whatever you're using). They're all designed to be user friendly so you shouldn't get stuck with any of them.<br>
<br>
Additional to this, you need to follow the forum rules, paying attention to both <i><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080405144516/http://elitistjerks.com/f15/a5-forum_rules/" target="_blank">this post</a></i> and <i><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080405144516/http://elitistjerks.com/f15/a25-forum_account_profiles/" target="_blank">this post</a></i>. Deciding you're above these or just ignoring them is likely to get you into an arguement with the mods/banned very quickly.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Random Info</b><br>
<br>
One standard abbreviations/shortenings I use is: 2t4 = Two pieces of Tier 4 (Malorne). Similar numbering for other sets (2t6, 4t6, etc)<br>
<br>
<b>This post <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080405144516/http://forums.wow-europe.com/thread.html?topicId=292919323&amp;sid=1" target="_blank"><i>here</i></a> will be referenced quite a few times, as it has all the rating conversions for level 70 players explained.</b> It is important to note that (as of patch 2.3) both Melee and Spell haste rating conversion is now 15.7 rating per 1% of haste, not the values stated in the link. Other values are subject to change in future patch notes, and I will try and make sure this stays up to date.<br>
If you're wondering where I pulled some random numbers from while talking about how stats are affected by things, chances are that this thread or the talent tree will be the best places to look.<br>
<br>
Talking of talent trees, if you're looking for a good feral spec <a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?talent=0ZxhGsfboezioVx0z" target="_blank"><i>this</i></a> should be your base spec. It includes all the important things you need for being a feral druid. The spare points can be put into many different things. The talents I recommend to put the rest of the points into are:<br>
Brutal Impact <br>
Savage Fury <br>
Primal Tenacity <br>
Natures Grasp (and possibly Control of Nature for a PvP oriented build, although other points may shift around for that. I'm not good at PvP so I won't even try and tell you how to do it).<br>
Natural Shapeshifter<br>
Intensity<br>
All are good talents with usefulness dependant on what you like to do.<br>
<br>
If you've read through the main posts and haven't found what you're looking for, have a quick look again and then ask in the thread. Asking repeat questions which are already answered is likely to get people annoyed, while posting new questions that need answers is likely to get people interested in finding out what's going on.<br>
<br>
<br>
<u><b><font size="2">Useful Mods</font></b></u><br>
Some form of energy tick mod is very useful whilst DPSing, as is a timer bar for Mangle/DOT's. Personally I use Pitbull and Quartz (from wowace.com) but there's a lot of other options out there. <br>

Explains about being a cat in a DPS role. I don't know what other role you could do as a cat, but whatever. Contains stuff like stats to go for, what enchants, items, gems, set bonuses and professions are good, what powershifting is, and some other stuff.<br>
<br>
<b>All gear suggestions in this post are summaries which are true for the majority of gear setups. If you're in doubt, use the spreadsheets/DPS calcs at the bottom of this post to put in your own gear and work it out for your own setup!</b><br>
<br>
----------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<u><b><font size="2">The Basics - Stats</font></b></u><br>
<br>
Stats and what they give you. Brackets are raid buffed values while the normal ones are unbuffed. All values are assuming HoTW and SoTF. All values are per 1 point of stat. Also see Athinira's Stat/DPS Analysis on the druid wiki, linked at the end of this post.<br>
<br>
<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px">
	<div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom:0px"><img src="assets/code_html.gif" border="0"></div>
	<pre class="alt2" dir="ltr" style="
		margin: 0px;
		padding: 3px;
		border: 1px inset;
		width: 694px;
		height: 274px;
		text-align: left;
		overflow: auto">Strength                  = 2.266 (2.49) AP

Agility                   = 1.133 (1.25) AP, 1% crit per ~25 agility (1% crit per ~22 agility).

Critical Strike Rating    = ~1% crit per 22.1 critical strike rating.

Hit Rating                = 1% hit per ~15.8 hit rating [[You need ~9% hit to 
                            become hit capped, so ~142 hit rating total]] 

Attack Power              = 1.1 AP

Expertise                 = Expertise gives 0.25% less dodge and parry per point. 
                            This makes expertise a lot less desirable in comparison to the 
                            old form of weapon skill for a player that isn't hit capped, and 
                            marginally less desirable than the old form of weapon skill for a 
                            player that is hit capped.</pre>
</div>Currently Agility is accepted as the best stat to stack lots of, with good reason (decent AP per point, very good amount of crit% per point). The value of Agility in comparison to Strength varies. There's a chart that shows that if you have minimal raid buffs, that you will always have Agility as more worthwhile than Strength. even without raid buffs, the majority of the time Agility will be better than Strength.<br>
<br>
----------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<u><b><font size="2">Gems</font></b></u><br>
From the stat analysis it can easily be seen that purely +agility gems are the best things to socket with (<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32194" target="_blank">[Delicate Crimson Spinel]</a>, <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=24028" target="_blank">[Delicate Living Ruby]</a>. However, you need to have 2 yellow and 2 blue gems for the <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32409" target="_blank">[Relentless Earthstorm Diamond]</a> (generally accepted as the best meta for druids), which are best made up with either <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32217" target="_blank">[Inscribed Pyrestone]</a> (<a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=24058" target="_blank">[Inscribed Noble Topaz]</a>) or <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32220" target="_blank">[Glinting Pyrestone]</a>(<a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=24061" target="_blank">[Glinting Noble Topaz]</a>) for the yellow slots, along with grabbing 2x <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32212" target="_blank">[Shifting Shadowsong Amethyst]</a> (<a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=24055" target="_blank">[Shifting Nightseye]</a>) for the blue slots, or (if you can get it) a <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30549" target="_blank">[Shifting Tanzanite]</a>.<br>
<br>
----------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<u><b><font size="2">Enchants</font></b></u><br>
Enchants are generally pretty easy to work out. Cenarion Glyph for the helm (16hit/34AP) or the Lower City (17str/16int) if you're hit capped, Aldor/Scryer AP/crit enchant for shoulders, +6 stats for chest, +12 strength for bracers (possible to use +4 all stats if you prefer), +15 agility for gloves, +50ap/12crit for legs, +12 agi for boots, +35 agi for weapon. Some of these are interchangable with more tanking oriented ones dependant on your exact role in the raid/what piece it is on. <br>
<br>
For Ring Enchants, +2 weapon damage is very marginally better in terms of pure DPS to +4 stats when fully raid buffed, however +4 stats will also give you extra stamina, int and spirit so is probably more worthwhile when taking everything into account.<br>

<b><u><font size="2">Set Bonuses</font></u></b><br>
Two pieces of tier 4 is good. Very good. So damned good you probably won't believe it. The only thing that comes close to it is four pieces of tier 6, and even then that's personal preference really. I personally prefer 4t6 to 2t4.<br>
<br>
The upshot of 2t4 being so good is that 4t5 is practically worthless. 2t5 is nice to have, but 4t5 means you give up 2t4. 4t4 is also rather good, but it depends on what you're upgrading to as to whether it's worth upgrading and needs to be taken on an individual basis. Using the stat "weights" above you should be able to work out whether it's an upgrade or not.<br>
<br>
For the 2t4 bonus, it depends on what you're using in other slots as to which pieces of t4 are best. Using the 2t4 bonus should still be considered as best regardless of what pieces you're giving up - it's only T6 set pieces with the 4 piece bonus or the new Sunwell loot that is better than keeping the 2 piece bonus. The best way to work out which pieces of t4 are best to use is to use one of the DPS spreadsheets/calculators linked at the bottom of this post to see which parts are best for your own situation. In general, the shoulders and helm are the best pieces to keep for the bonus.<br>
<br>
Due to people not being able to work out what gear to use on their own, Valerian has posted this as a general summary of what is good to use at different gear levels.<br>

<u><b><font size="2">Idols</font></b></u><br>
The main idols for comparison are <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=29390" target="_blank">[Everbloom Idol]</a>, the <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32387" target="_blank">[Idol of the Raven Goddess]</a> and the <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33509" target="_blank">[Idol of Terror]</a>. All other idols are pretty sub-par, mainly because of switching an idol in combat losing a white attack (reset of the swing timer) which is way more damage than an idol will affect.<br>
<br>
Idol of the Raven Goddess gives +0.9% crit to everyone in the party. Assuming an average person in your party does 1500 DPS with a direct 1%crit-&gt;1% damage ratio (which isn't far off), it's a gain of ~13.5DPS per member of your group, or 54 DPS + your own gain (more likely to be 12-13 or so). Remember that it's ~13.5DPS per physical DPS member of your group! Still, you only need 2 other physical DPS people in your group for the Idol of the Raven Goddess to come out as the best idol for RDPS.<br>
<br>
Everbloom idol is 88 damage per shred. Assuming you shred once per 4 seconds (general average based on using some energy for mangles/rips, losing some through dodges/etc), that gives 25-30 DPS factoring in crits and armour reduction and everything else.<br>
<br>
The Idol of Terror is another easily available idol from Heroic badges, and is almost as good for personal DPS as the Everbloom but is also useful for tanking. Personal preference again prevails, so some people use the Everbloom and some the Terror. The disadvantage of the Terror is that it is chance based, although it does have a very high % chance, so it's always possible to get very low uptime on a fight which may make it look bad in comparison to the Everbloom.<br>
<br>
You should always use the Idol of the Raven Goddess if in a tank/melee/hunter group with more than 2 other physical DPS. If you aren't in a group with other physical DPSers, using the Idol of Terror or Everbloom Idol is more of a personal choice than a pure DPS choice.<br>
<br>
----------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<u><b><font size="2">Trinkets</font></b></u><br>
The main options for trinkets are (listed top to bottom in approximate order of goodness):<br>
<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30664" target="_blank">[Living Root of the Wildheart]</a> - Bad. Very bad for where it is. Not even really worth it if you're going to be in bear form half the time really (which is very few fights anyway). <br>
<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32486" target="_blank">[Ashtongue Talisman of Equilibrium]</a> - Quite good, but not quite as good as some of the other trinkets. There's been a lot of discussion in the past about it, because it depends on how much/when you mangle as to how effective it is. Because of the standard DPS cycle meaning that it's not possible to have it active when you're about to rip, it loses some of it's effectiveness. It's still alright trinket though, but probably not one of the best.<br>
<a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28034" target="_blank">[Hourglass of the Unraveller]</a> - A very good trinket for where you get it. ((proc = 45 second cooldown, 10% chance))<br>
<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=29383" target="_blank">[Bloodlust Brooch]</a> - Easy-ish to get and very effective. ((2 minute cooldown))<br>
<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=31856" target="_blank">[Darkmoon Card: Crusade]</a> - Quite hard to get, but also quite good once you get it. How good it is depends on fight more than anything (lots of movement = bad).<br>
<a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32654" target="_blank">[Crystalforged Trinket]</a> - One of the best trinkets to get, and very easy to get too. ((1 minute cooldown))<br>
<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30627" target="_blank">[Tsunami Talisman]</a> - Upgraded version of the Hourglass. Not much more to say.<br>
<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32505" target="_blank">[Madness of the Betrayer]</a> - Hard to get but very good, as long as you aren't hit capped. ((not sure on proc rate))<br>
<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28830" target="_blank">[Dragonspine Trophy]</a> - Apparently still the best around, even after all the nerfs. Be warned that you may recieve some skepticism from other physical DPS classes if you express an interest in it.<br>
<br>
The three main types of trinkets listed are Activate trinkets (which sometimes have a passive effect), Random-passive trinkets (which also sometimes have passive effects), and purely passive trinkets. The majority of trinkets in the Burning Crusade are of the first two types. Active trinkets are preferred by some because of the controllability of the effect, while random-passive are preferred by others because they don't have to worry about activating them. Random-passive effects generally have a "hidden" cooldown, and then a good chance to proc giving them approximately a 1 proc per minute total proc rate.<br>
<br>

<u><b><font size="2">Other Items</font></b></u><br>
Due to the interest in Idols and Trinkets I've put them separately. In general for other item slots it's pretty clear what to go for, because there isn't much choice. There's a lot of rings that are very similar, and the tier pieces are very well itemised although with the upcoming changes to HoTW a lot of rogue gear is going to become even better than it was in a lot of slots.<br>
<br>
The best place to look for a good estimate of how gear will affect you is the DPS spreadsheets/charts/analysis section at the end of this post.<br>
<br>
Malazaar has posted values for stats depending on general levels of gear <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080405144516/http://elitistjerks.com/504590-post29.html" target="_blank"><i>here</i></a>, which gives values for stats to be used for comparing items dependant on what gear level you're at. <br>
<br>
----------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<b><u><font size="2">Professions</font></u></b><br>
The main professions in the game are Tailoring (craft), Leatherworking (craft), Blacksmithing (craft), Alchemy (craft), Jewelcrafting (craft), Engineering (craft), Enchanting (gather/craft), Herbalism (gather), Mining (gather), and Skinning (gather). The general rules are that gathering professions are good for making money, and crafting professions are good for making lumps of money if you can get rare items, or making nice stuff that you can use. <br>
<br>
The interesting ones in terms of feral druids are Leatherworking, Jewelcrafting, Engineering, and Enchanting. Gathering skills are good if you want to make money (generally herbalism and mining are better than skinning) or to support a main skill (skinning is good if you have leatherworking, generally). Alchemy is useful for making pots, but there's normally a lot of alchemists around so you can get pots made elsewhere anyway.<br>
<br>
<b>Leatherworking</b><br>
Leatherworking provides a number of decent benefits some of which are useful all the way through the game as it currently stands.<br>
<br>
Provides armour patch crafting (<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=29535" target="_blank">[Nethercobra Leg Armor]</a><a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=29536" target="_blank">[Nethercleft Leg Armor]</a> are the two interesting ones). Also provides some items which are good for their slots - see <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30041" target="_blank">[Boots of Natural Grace]</a>, <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30042" target="_blank">[Belt of Natural Power]</a> and <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30040" target="_blank">[Belt of Deep Shadow]</a>. Both the belts are BoE items with the plans being BoP, but leatherworking is generally not a common profession, so being a leatherworker may end up with you being the only one available to pick up the plans. The boots are a good investment at the point you get them (~SSC/TK level, can buy the plan off the AH/guilds before that). Leatherworking also allows you to create Drums, the best of which for a feral druid is the <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=29529" target="_blank">[Drums of Battle]</a>. These are both instant, and usable in forms which makes them very useful. <br>
<br>
All the items made from being a leatherworker (other than the armour kits, which are more of an enchant than an item) will get outdated once you start getting to t6 content (i.e. the boots). It's certainly still worth being a leatherworker for the benefit of both making armour patches and being able to use (and make) drums, even if the other items get outdated or can be made by other people.<br>
<br>
<b>Jewelcrafting</b><br>
Jewelcrafting provides a few minor benefits, such as special gems and craftable trinkets.<br>
<br>
The main useful thing for a feral druid is the 18 stamina, 12 crit rating and 24 attack power gems. Neither the AP or crit rating gems are better than 8 agility, but may be useful in a situation where you need a yellow socket for a bonus (insidious bands for the +2 agi bonus, for example). There is a possibility 12 agility and 12 strength gems will be introduced - they are in the databases (wowhead/etc) but the plans for crafting them are not. Be aware that all these gems are unique-equipped!<br>
<br>
The trinkets that may be useful dependant on where you are in the game are the <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=24125" target="_blank">[Figurine - Dawnstone Crab]</a>, <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=24128" target="_blank">[Figurine - Nightseye Panther]</a> and <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=24124" target="_blank">[Figurine - Felsteel Boar]</a> although none are better than a lot of other fairly easily available trinkets at any level.<br>
<br>
<b>Engineering</b><br>
Engineering is more of a PvP profession, but also has a couple of minor benefits for PvE.<br>
<br>
<b>Enchanting</b><br>
Enchanting provides a couple of nice things such as ring enchants and never having to find an enchanter/pay an enchanter.<br>
<br>
The ring enchants that are of worth are +4 to all stats and +2 weapon damage. These are approximately equal in DPS terms, although +4 stats is better in an overall sense (more mana/health on top of the dps stuff). +4 stats is becoming available from Honoured with Lower City in patch 2.3, instead of being a Scale of the Sands (Hyjal Summit) rep item.<br>
<br>
----------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<b><u><font size="2">Consumables</font></u></b><br>
<a class="q1" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=27659" target="_blank">[Warp Burger]</a> is the best food choice, <a class="q1" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=27664" target="_blank">[Grilled Mudfish]</a> is an equivalent for fishing. The bottom left of Terokkar is the best place I've found for farming Warped Flesh (80/hour or so), and Figluster's Mudfish can be easily found in Nagrand, where there are pools of them. Alternatives are <a class="q1" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=27658" target="_blank">[Roasted Clefthoof]</a> and <a class="q1" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33872" target="_blank">[Spicy Hot Talbuk]</a>.<br>
<a class="q1" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=22831" target="_blank">[Elixir of Major Agility]</a> is the best battle elixir choice, although <a class="q1" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28104" target="_blank">[Elixir of Mastery]</a> isn't bad.<br>
There is no "best" guardian elixir choice, however <a class="q1" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32062" target="_blank">[Elixir of Major Fortitude]</a> is good.<br>
<a class="q1" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=22854" target="_blank">[Flask of Relentless Assault]</a> is the best Flask choice for DPS. It's approximately equal in terms of outright DPS to the Elixir of Major Agility, but cannot be used with a guardian elixir. It also provides no dodge, which may (or may not) be useful dependant on your role and what fight it is.<br>
<a class="q1" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=22838" target="_blank">[Haste Potion]</a> is the best potion for DPS (they provide ~25% haste). Using haste potions on cooldown will gain you approximately 25 DPS (4 extra hits at ~600 each over a 120 second period).<br>
<a class="q1" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=22828" target="_blank">[Insane Strength Potion]</a>'s are good for big numbers, but not as good as haste pots over time - averages to approximately 35AP over 2 minutes, which according to Toskk's DPS sheet gives around 5-10 DPS.<br>
<a class="q1" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=18841" target="_blank">[Combat Mana Potion]</a>'s can be very useful if you powershift a lot and still get called on to combat res/etc. They stack to 10 and can be bought for battleground tokens.<br>
<a class="q1" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33208" target="_blank">[Flask of Chromatic Wonder]</a> is also a reasonable DPS flask if you're going to be tanking at some point during the time. It's a good mixed use flask and is worth it in a lot of situations.<br>
<br>
----------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<b><u><font size="2">Powershifting</font></u></b><br>
Many people ask what powershifting is. The basics: Furor gives the player 40 energy when they switch out of form and back in. This means you can shift out and in for a net gain of 40 energy, every time. This is essentially a conversion of Mana to Energy, as it will always cost you mana to shift. By timing the shift you can make it so you lose as little energy as possible (from the residual energy in your bar when you shift and the energy you lose while out of form), and this is essentially the skill of Powershifting. By doing it correctly you should be able to gain about 30-35 energy, and even doing it badly the gains should be in the region of 20 energy or so, although it is possible to gain no energy or even lose energy if you do it badly. By doing this you can gain a decent amount of DPS, an general analysis of the DPS gain you can expect follows:<br>
<br>
Over the course of two minutes or so, you should easily get around 125 energy (5 shifts worth, minus a few per shift for "imperfect" shifts) if you pay attention. 125/42 = ~3 extra shreds (126). 3 shreds at around 1500 damage each = 4500 extra damage without crits, or ~10000 damage with (40-80 DPS or so), plus 3-6 combo points (probably another 20-30 dps on it's own). Total DPS gain of around 70-80 or so, which is pretty nice.<br>
<br>
It's now possible to powershift instantly. The following macro will shift you out of form and back in to form with no "lag" as it's all client side:<br>
<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px">
	<div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom:0px"><img src="assets/code_html.gif" border="0"></div>
	<pre class="alt2" dir="ltr" style="

		padding: 3px;
		border: 1px inset;
		width: 694px;
		height: 34px;
		text-align: left;
		overflow: auto">/cast !Cat Form</pre>
</div>----------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<b><u><font size="2">Windfury</font></u></b><br>
Druids do not gain windfury in Cat or Bear form. It is often asked "how much increase in DPS would we gain with windfury?" because of this, as many people see it as a reason why our DPS is not as good as it maybe should be, so I've done a general estimate below:<br>
<br>
<i><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080405144516/http://wowwebstats.com/pmr6ew5zblmzi?s=3840-4052&amp;a=12" target="_blank">dukes - WWS</a></i><br>
<br>
Total number of white hits: 185 (35 normal, 50 glancing, 100 crit). <br>
185*0.2 = 37. <br>
<br>
with a 50% crit rate, this is 19 hits and 18 crits. Taking average values for these:<br>
((425+((578.5*1.1)/14))*19) + ((832+((578.5*1.1)/14 * 2.26))*18) = ~9k + 17k = ~26k damage. <br>
Present from 20:25'26 to 20:28'48 (100 %) = 202 seconds.<br>
<br>
26k/202 = <b>~129 DPS total.</b><br>
<br>
129 / 1544 = approximately <b>8% DPS</b> increase.<br>
<br>
It's a pretty crap estimate, but at least it gives an estimate and it should be something close to right (this is assuming a shaman with improved weapon totems and UR).<br>
<br>
----------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<u><b><font size="2">DPS Cycle</font></b></u><br>
The standard cycle is:<br>
Mangle -&gt; Shred to 5 combo points -&gt; Wait for 70+ energy (preferably 80+), Rip-&gt;Mangle, start again.<br>
<br>
Due to the way Rip scales with combo points, a four combo point rip is almost as effective as a 5 combo point rip (there is a static gain, AP doesn't scale between 4 and 5). This makes it quite effective to use a 4 combo point rip if your mangle has already run out (as a non-mangled shred is pretty pathetic in comparison to a mangled one).<br>

Explains stuff like what you need to be normally uncrittable, what the stats mean and how you should be looking to gear yourself.<br>
<br>
----------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<b><u><font size="2">The Basics - Stats</font></u></b><br>
I'll start off similar to the Cat post, by explaining the (important) stat conversions. Bear form is for tanking, therefore your tanking stats are the most important part of your gear, in general. Each is explained per point.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Mitigation Stats</b><br>
Stats and what they give you. Brackets are raid buffed values while the normal ones are unbuffed. All values are assuming HoTW and SoTF. All values are per 1 point of stat. <br>
<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px">
	<div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom:0px"><img src="assets/code_html.gif" border="0"></div>
	<pre class="alt2" dir="ltr" style="
		margin: 0px;
		padding: 3px;
		border: 1px inset;
		width: 694px;
		height: 274px;
		text-align: left;
		overflow: auto">Agility         = ~0.07% ((~14.7 agility per % dodge, or ~13 agility on gear per %dodge with 
                  SotF and BoK)) [[Same crit conversion as for Cat form]] [[Grace of Air is 
                  77 agility (90 improved) which comes out as approximately 6% dodge (7% 
                  improved) in a raid environment]]
				  
Dodge Rating    = ~0.05% ((18.9 dodge rating per % dodge))

Stamina         = 15.45 health (17hp/point)

Defence         = 2.4 rating per skill, 1 skill = 0.04% dodge, miss, anti-crit ((25 defence,
                  or 60 rating, for 1% less crit/more dodge/more miss))

Resillience     = ~0.025% anti-crit ((39.4 resillience for 1% less crit and 1% less damage 
                  from DOTs))

Armour          = 35880 armour to be capped at 75% reduction versus level 73 mobs.</pre>
</div>The main priorities as a bear are to get un-crittable (for which you need <b>2.6%</b> anti-crit), get decent amounts of health and armour and, if in an OT or hybrid role, stack agility. 2.6% anti-crit is 156 defence rating (415 defence total) (<b>155 will not do, although the character screen will inform you that you have 2.6% less chance to be crit (415 defence)!</b>) or 103 resillience. You can mix and match, but make sure you check afterwards that you have a total that comes out to more than 2.6% to be safe. Remember that although you need more defence, you do get some avoidance out of it so it's not always most worth getting pure resillience.<br>
<br>
If you want to skip a point in SotF, you need 1% more crit immunity to make up for it (39.4 resillience or 25 defence (60 defence rating)). To get to the full cap (i.e. no points in SotF) you need 221 resillience or 140 defence (336 defence rating) in total.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>The value of avoidance</b><br>
<br>
Defence gets you avoidance at a rate of 1% more dodge/miss per 60 rating. <br>
Agility gets you 1% more avoidance at a rate of about 14 agility per 1% dodge.<br>
<br>
See first graph from <i><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080405144516/http://elitistjerks.com/attachments/f31/a1674d1198059689-feral_druid_megathread/avoidance2.jpg" target="_blank">here</a></i> (fear my mad excel skills, done in between bits at work). Avoidance has more effect once you get to the crushing range. (it should be for 101.2% for a 73 boss mob but its the same principle).<br>
<br>
Getting a good balance of all stats or stacking stamina will almost certainly be easier to heal overall than stacking avoidance to the point at which you start to push crushings off the hit table (86.2% total avoidance against a lvl73), even with the raid debuffs that you can take advantage of (insect swarm/scorpid sting is 7% extra avoidance).<br>
<br>
See second graph from <i><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080405144516/http://elitistjerks.com/attachments/f31/a1674d1198059689-feral_druid_megathread/avoidance2.jpg" target="_blank">here</a></i> for the comparison of avoidance against worth of 1% avoidance.<br>
<br>
Note that if you're on 60% dodge, 6% miss (total 66%) and you don't have insect swarm/scorpid sting while they are available in the raid, you're missing out on about 15-20% damage reduction (~2.5% per 1% avoidance at 65%, ~3.3% per 1% avoidance at 75%).<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Threat Stats</b><br>
<br>
In general Bear tanks have less trouble with threat than Warrior tanks, and this is seen as a major strength of Feral Druids. The stats that have value for threat are detailed below, with normal values being unbuffed and bracketed being buffed, assuming HoTW and SotF.<br>
<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px">
	<div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom:0px"><img src="assets/code_html.gif" border="0"></div>
	<pre class="alt2" dir="ltr" style="
		margin: 0px;
		padding: 3px;
		border: 1px inset;
		width: 694px;
		height: 194px;
		text-align: left;
		overflow: auto">Strength                  = 2.06AP per point (2.266 AP per point)

Agility                   = ~1% crit per 25 agility (~1% crit per 22 agility)

Critical Strike Rating    = 1% per 22.1 rating at 70

Hit Rating                = 1% hit per ~15.8 hit rating  

Attack Power              = 1 AP per point.

Expertise Rating          = Expertise gives 0.25% less dodge and parry per point.</pre>
</div>Agility features pretty heavily in both the tanking and mitigation stat lineups - it's a very good multipurpose stat, and will be very useful on gear that you use for both bear and cat forms.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Hit Rating and Expertise</b><br>
<br>
Hit rating gives 1% hit per ~16 rating.<br>
Expertise gives 1% less parry and 1% less dodge per ~16 rating.<br>
<br>
There are a lot of good available items now that contain hit or expertise. Expertise is of approximately double the value of hit rating up to approximately 96 rating (24 expertise), then becomes approximately the same value. This amount of expertise is not easily attainable and so it can be said that, at this time, expertise is always better than hit rating for a bear as a solo stat. Consideration of the item that it is on needs to be made. <br>
<br>
Expertise has a secondary effect of reducing parries. Mob's have an effect where when they parry it hastens their next swing by ~40%, therefore reducing/removing their ability to parry can have a large effect on incoming burst damage.<br>
<br>
Hit rating has the secondary effect of increasing taunt hit. This can be very important for particular fights and so it may be worth putting together a secondary set of gear with capped hit rating (~9%, ~142 hit rating). Although this will not cap your taunt resists (as taunt counts as a spell for %, meaning you need 17% to cap it, or 268 hit rating) it will reduce the resist rate to 8%, which is more than half the previous chance for a resist. It is not really practical to put together a &gt;142 hit rating gear set due to the hit only increasing taunt hit rate, and the reduction in survival stats that you would otherwise get.<br>
<br>
One item stands out among the rest for hit and expertise, which is the <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33296" target="_blank">[Brooch of Deftness]</a>. The cost of obtaining this item along with the amount of hit and expertise gained from it makes it a very highly recommended item to use. The cost of this item is also relatively low and can be obtained by pretty much anyone at level 70 in a small amount of time.<br>
<br>
Other items containing expertise that could be used are (in no particular order):<br>
<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30055" target="_blank">[Shoulderpads of the Stranger]</a><br>
<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30106" target="_blank">[Belt of One-Hundred Deaths]</a><br>
<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=29947" target="_blank">[Gloves of the Searing Grip]</a><br>
<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30834" target="_blank">[Shapeshifter's Signet]</a><br>
<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=29171" target="_blank">[Earthwarden]</a><br>
<a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=31544" target="_blank">[Clefthoof Hide Leggings]</a> - another very good entry level piece that has hit too.<br>
<br>
There are a lot of items that include hit rating. The S3 arena gear is very good for tanking due to resillience along with hit (especially with the 2 piece bonus). There is a large number of other pieces with hit rating on them, so I won't list them all here, but a quick WoWhead filtered search for druids can be found <i><a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?items&amp;filter=sl=16:5:8:11:10:1:7:2:28:3:12:17:6:9;ub=11;cr=110:95;crs=1:1;crv=0:1" target="_blank">here</a></i>.<br>

----------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<b><u><font size="2">Roles, Gems, Enchants and Professions</font></u></b><br>
There are two main roles that you will take as a feral while tanking: Main tanking, in which you are the number one tank tanking the boss, and offtanking, where you are either soaking damage on a fight such as Gruul or Supremus, or tanking a mob for a short amount of time/limited periods, like Morogrim, Karathress or Lurker, for example. In the first instance, stamina is generally king along with armour. Due to the amount of stamina that a bear tank can setup on their gear, they can become great tanks for certain fights. Armour generally comes with good gear anyway, but it's still worth paying attention to. As an MT you want to be at the armour cap if possible to do so without sacrificing too many good pieces of gear. As an OT/Hybrid you want to maximise the value you can get out of your gear if you happen to switch to DPS mid-way through a fight, and help the healers mana along while tanking. This means that agility is generally king, as long as you have a decent amount of armour. <br>
<br>
Coming on to the topic of gems, this makes it fairly easy. You either go for pure Stamina (<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32200" target="_blank">[Solid Empyrean Sapphire]</a> or <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=24033" target="_blank">[Solid Star of Elune]</a>, Stamina/Agility (<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32212" target="_blank">[Shifting Shadowsong Amethyst]</a> or <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=24055" target="_blank">[Shifting Nightseye]</a> - useful for if you MT some fights and use the same gear for other fights you DPS on), or pure Agility (<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32194" target="_blank">[Delicate Crimson Spinel]</a> or <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=24028" target="_blank">[Delicate Living Ruby]</a>). If you are in need of a tiny bit of extra anti-crit, a resillience/stamina gem or pure resillience gem is probably the best choice, although 12 defence is not a bad enchant for bracers.<br>
<br>
Again enchants are dependant on role in the raid these can vary. Many are shared with the DPS equivalents, especially if you are in a hybrid/offtank role.<br>

It's a good mixed use flask and is worth it in a lot of situations.<br>
As of 2.3 it will be possible to instantly shift (using /cancelform with macros) to use potions during combat, heavily reducing (I'm not going to say eliminating because it's possible that it won't completely eliminate it) the chance of being hit while switching to take a potion. The only real survival potions are Protection potions (Fire/Shadow/etc) and <a class="q1" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=13446" target="_blank">[Major Healing Potion]</a>'s. <br>
<br>
----------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<u><b><font size="2">Threat Generation</font></b></u><br>
In a general sense, threat generation for bear tanks is very good in comparison to other tanks. Mangle is exceptional as a threat generator, and white hits give a lot of rage, along with the talent Primal Fury which gives 5 rage on a crit (works on every individual crit, so a triple-crit swipe gives 15 rage back). Also see the hit and expertise section earlier in this post, as gear can play a big role in threat generation.<br>
<br>
In rage starved situations a good tip is to NOT use maul. Maul is good for threat generation, but severely gimps rage generation by reducing the rage you gain from white hits. A crit in good tanking gear can be upwards of 1000 damage, generating a significant chunk of rage (30+) along with the extra 5 from Primal Fury. By converting this attack into a maul, you "lose" the rage you would have gained from the white hit, but it also costs you the rage cost of Maul (10). This means that maul costs you can effective 40 rage or more, which could be used for other special attacks if you're rage-starved (especially useful to note when you're offtanking something like Gruul). Maul is very useful for getting "snap" agro on mobs though, as it will activate as soon as you are in range.<br>
<br>
In no particular order, the threat moves you should be using:<br>
- Mangle. You should always be using this if it is off cooldown.<br>
- Swipe. You should be using this if tanking more than 1 mob, as long as it doesn't screw up crowd control (sheep/etc).<br>
- Lacerate. This is (generally) for tanking one mob in a low damage/high armour situation (i.e. the mob has high armour or you're doing low damage to it because of lack of buffs or similar). The bleed part of lacerate has little impact on threat in the overall scheme of things. Lacerating just to keep up 5 stacks is probably worth it with the change to 2.4 threat generation.<br>
- Maul. As above, use when you have a lot of rage and don't use if you're rage starved a lot.<br>
<br>
Generally the point where swipe overtakes lacerate in terms of threat output is when it's doing ~225 damage to the target normally - this value varies dependant on bleed immunity and whether you're keeping 5 stacks up as well as crit chance <i><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080405144516/http://elitistjerks.com/534882-post532.html" target="_blank">(see this post)</a></i>. Lacerate now scales its damage with attack power - this has very little effect on the actual threat of Lacerate. Lacerate works by having a lot of "static" threat, and then generating a very, very small amount extra from the damage done (0.2 * damage). This means that even if you were to get 100 extra damage from your AP over the 15 second dot with 5 stacks, it would increase the threat by 20, which is not really a significant amount over 15 seconds.<br>
<br>
----------------------------------------------------------------<br>
<b><u><font size="2">Boss List</font></u></b><br>
This is intended to give a guide as to what favours or does not favour being tanked as a Bear in Raid instances. Most guilds will favour Warrior tanks as standard due to better itemisation choice and access to both Last Stand and Shield Wall which can seriously increase the chances of making a screwed up attempt into a kill.<br>
<br>
<b>T4:</b><br>
- Karazhan: All bosses other than Juliet (spell interrupt), Maiden of Virtue (emergency buttons), and possibly the Prince (debatable) are fine for tanking as a druid. <br>
- Maulgar and Gruul: Maulgar himself favours a druid tank (doesn't crush with specials, armour mitigation is very good as a druid at this level compared to other tanks). Gruul prefers a warrior as MT (emergency buttons for silence) with a Druid OT (threat generation is generally better than warriors).<br>
- Magtheridon: No preference either way really. Druid tanks are good on the initial adds (threat generation).<br>
<br>
<b>Zul'aman</b> (credit to Anathor for the original list).<br>
- Trash: no special requirements, although feral charge is very useful on scouts to root them.<br>
- Nalorakk (Bear): 2 tanks required, druids are well-suited for this fight since a large hp pool helps. Using some hit gear may be a reasonable trade off for other stats due to taunt being important to land. Possible advantage for warrior tanks (defensive stance vs bleeds).<br>
- Akil'zon (Eagle): No problems for a druid to tank this.<br>
- Halazzi (Lynx): 2 tanks required, druids are good to soak the saber lash type of ability (split damage on targets standing on top of each other) due to high armor/hp.<br>
- Jan'alai (Dragonhawk): 2 tanks required. Druids do fine either on either the boss or on adds.<br>
- Malacrass: No problem for a druid although interrupts are useful on this fight. Druids also work fine tanking an add in dps gear and then moving to a DPS role.<br>
- Zul'jin: Druids can tank him but intervene for warriors while in the lynx phase is useful, and therefore a warrior is a good choice for a tank although he doesn't necessarily need to be the MT.<br>
<br>
<b>Serpentshrine Cavern</b><br>
- Hydross: Lack of level 70 crafted Nature/Frost gear means that Hydross favours plate wearers as MT's in general. Druids are good as offtanks due to "snap" threat and overall threat generation. <br>
- Lurker: No real advantage either way.<br>
- Morogrim: No real advantage either way. Crushes but possible a warrior would not be crush immune (extra effects eat shield block charges).<br>
- Karathress: No real advantage either way, although Tidalvess (the Shaman) possibly favours a druid tank because of health/armour advantage over other tanks.<br>
- Leotheras: Doesn't especially favour any kind of tank. Snap agro generation of bears is good for pickup from Whirlwind stages.<br>
- Vashj: No real advantage either way (except emergency buttons).<br>
<br>
<b>Tempest Keep</b><br>
- Al'ar: Melt armour screws over any tank. Add pickup may be easier as a druid (feral charge with 15 second cooldown, snap agro from mangle).<br>
- Void Reaver: Threat generation while off-tanking is generally better for a druid.<br>
- Solarian: Hardly matters.<br>
- Kael: Add tanking - tanking Kael is left to those who can use shields.<br>
<br>
<b>Hyjal Summit</b><br>
- Rage Winterchill: Possibly better with a druid (threat generation) - he channel's a spell for 10 seconds every so often which reduces rage income from hits.<br>
- Anetheron: No advantage either way really.<br>
- Kaz'rogal: Possible druid advantage due to lack of shield block while stunned. No real difference.<br>
- Az'galor: Does not crush. Emergency buttons are good (silence). Advantages for both warrior or druid tanks.<br>
- Archimonde: Cannot Crush. Fears.  Possible this won't be an issue if you have a Dwarf/Dranei priest (fear ward), or post 2.3 if you have 4 priests who can organise themselves well.<br>
<br>
<b>Black Temple</b><br>
- High Warlord Naj'entus: Small amount of magic damage, but quite a lot of burst. Prefers warriors slightly due to ability to mitigate crushings with defensive stance reduction on the explosion damage which reduces the maximum possible burst damage by a significant amount.<br>
- Supremus: No benefit either way for MT.<br>
- Shade of Akama: Tanking adds, no real benefit either way.<br>
- Teron Gorefiend: No real benefit either way. Druids have more health/armour (in general) but he does crush and hits very hard.<br>
- Gurtogg Bloodboil: No real advantage either way - threat generation and emergency buttons are both good.<br>
- Reliquary of Souls: Virtually requires a Warrior for Phase 2 (spell reflect). Possibly favours a Druid for Phase 3 (threat generation).<br>
- Mother Shahraz: No real advantage either way (magic damage mitigation compared to armour mitigation).<br>
- The Illidari Council: Tanking the Priest, Warriors have advantage (interrupt), Tanking the Paladin Warriors have the advantage (spell reflect). <br>
- Illidan Stormrage: Tanking Illidan requires shield block for Shear. Phase 2 doesn't really favour any type of tank; Druids generally have a slight health and threat gen advantage along with SotF, while warriors can have 10 to 16% total magic reduction ([Improved] Defensive Stance).<br>
<br>

<u><b><font size="2">Macros</font></b></u><br>
This macro will check for Global Cooldown before shift-pot-shift for bear form - it's instant (client side) and so you should never be hit while out of bear form while using it. If you feel that you may be at risk using it, then simply don't use it. <br>

</div>Which will use: Master Healthstone, Bottled Nethergon Vapor, Red Ogre Brew, Volatile Healing Pot and Super Healing Pot (in that order). If you wish to switch out items (as you know you don't have them) or replace them with other items, go to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080405144516/http://wow.allakhazam.com/" target="_blank">Allakhazam.com: World of Warcraft</a> and search for the item you want - then look at the URL in your address bar and take the number from it and add a line reading "/use item:####". For example, if you search for "bottled nethergon vapor" and select the item, you get a link reading "http://wow.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?witem=32905;source=live" of which you want the number 32905. <b>The macro can only have 255 characters at maximum, so you can't just add every item</b>.<br>
It will use healthstones in the order you have them in your bags, not the highest first. The first slot will ALWAYS be the top left of your backpack (right hand bag from the default UI, the one you can't replace) and reads right -&gt; down <br>
i.e. for your backpack the slots are ordered such that slot 1 of the below will always be used first. If you use a UI mod I have no idea how it might change the order.<br>
<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px">

</div>In order to get them in the right order, stick your highest health healthstone in slot 1, second highest in slot 2, third highest in slot 3. All bags are ordered like this, so as long as they're in the right order, it doesn't matter where in your bags they are.<br>

Terestian's Stranglestaff = 829 (647)<br>

Total approximate buff of 28% AP. Remember that due to the HoTW change this is a total relative buff of ~40% in comparison to the old values (826 -&gt; 1164 = ~40%).<br>

01/04/08 - Adjusted Lacerate threat text for ability summary (bear post, threat gen).<br>
<br>
<br>
<b><u>Summary</u></b><br>
<br>
<b>Catform:</b><br>
- Stats: Agility is very good (primary stat).<br>
- Stats: ~9% hit (142 rating) for the hit cap.<br>
<br>
- Gems: Pure agility gems are the best. Still worth meeting the requirements for the Relentless Earthstorm Diamond though.<br>
<br>
- Enchants: Most are "obvious", Runspeed can give more gains than is obvious though. Ring enchants (+2wpn dmg/+4 stats) are approximately equal in pure DPS terms.<br>
<br>
- Set Bonuses: 2t4 ~= 4t6 &gt;&gt; *<br>
<br>
- Idols: When in a group with 2 or more other physical DPS, <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32387" target="_blank">[Idol of the Raven Goddess]</a> is the best idol. If you are the only physical DPS, <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=29390" target="_blank">[Everbloom Idol]</a> ~=~ <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33509" target="_blank">[Idol of Terror]</a>.<br>
<br>
- Trinkets: All high-ish end level trinkets are good, as long as it's not the Living Root.<br>
<br>
- Consumables: Elixirs for non-wipe content, flasks for wipe content. Both are pretty comparable (major agility vs relentless assault). Food is easy to farm, use it!<br>
<br>
- Powershifting: Making use of Furor to convert mana -&gt; energy through shifting.<br>
<br>
- Windfury: Would be a decent increase in DPS on initial inspection (~8%). Possibly not needed with the current cat DPS, but would still be nice to benefit from as a group buff.<br>
<br>
- DPS Cycle: Mangle -&gt; Shred to 4 // 5 Combo Points -&gt; wait for energy (70+, 80+ preferably), Rip-&gt;restart.<br>
<br>
<b>Bearform:</b><br>
<br>
- Stats: Agility is good, Stamina is good, Armour is good. A split of three is probably the best.<br>
- Stats: You need 156 defence or 103 resillience to be crit immune with SotF. Mixing the two stats is fine, just make sure you check that you're still crit immune with rounding errors!<br>
- Stats: Hit rating is good, Expertise is very good. A small amount of both can make a major difference! Hit rating will increase taunt hit (but 17% or 268 hit rating worth is needed to cap it).<br>
<br>
- Gems: Agility is good. Stamina is good. A mix of both is also good.<br>
<br>
- Enchants: Runspeed can give more gains than is obvious.<br>
<br>
- Consumables: Major Agility elixir with Major Fortitude is the best combination, but for 'wipe content' you may want to use a flask of Fortification. Food is easy to farm, use it!<br>
<br>
- Raid Boss Tanking: There are a couple of bosses which seriously favour Warriors due to abilities only they have. In most other situations Druid's are either slightly favoured (threat generation) or perfectly acceptable (disadvantages/advantages either way).<br>
<br>
- Threat Generation: Mangle is very good. Swipe scales with DPS, Lacerate does but very minimally. Generally, if swipe does 225 damage or more on a default hit, it will do more threat than Lacerate.<br>
- Threat Generation: If you're rage starved, don't use Maul. It's effective rage cost is a lot higher than you might think.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
A couple of things that might be worth adding.<br>
<br>
FAP conversion:  The Feral AP added to a weapon is 14 x (1H dps - 41.3) where 1H dps is the DPS on a 1H weapon of the same item value.  This is easy to establish using the various pvp weapons.  It is also being changed in 2.3.<br>
<br>
Run speed:  Getting a runspeed boost is often the best thing you can do for your dps and sometimes required for tanking.<br>
<br>
Also mention the /cancelform change.  Although i'm somewhat sceptical of its use. Which I guess could also allow you to add a procs and pots section.  2t4 has a 4% fixed proc rate, and so gets some benefit from haste rating.  None of the druid trinkets/idols proc enough to be better than the other options.  No weapon procs in forms rules out WF and mongoose too.<br>
<br>
In other news I used the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080405144516/http://druid.wikispaces.com/ToskksDPSGearMethod" target="_blank">The Druid Wiki » ToskksDPSGearMethod</a> to work out some stat weightings for 2.3, and the rogue set gear came out to be the best items for dps in most slots and tiers.  Good because it suggests that the new approach will help, bad because our set gear is now poorly optimised for dps as well as tanking.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I believe it was concluded in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080405144516/http://elitistjerks.com/472184-post530.html" target="_blank">Weapon Skill Adjustment thread</a> that the first 20 rating / 5 skill gives exactly 3% hit, 0.4% for skill points 1 through 4, then 1.4% for the 5th.<br>
<br>
Also worth mentioning that the rating to skill conversion doesn't round values, it floors them. So the 18 rating on <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=31544" target="_blank">[Clefthoof Hide Leggings]</a> only gives you 4 skill, leaving you shy of the 5 skill sweet spot.<br>

</div>The agility to dodge conversion is somewhere in the vicinity of ~14.7 agi per 1% dodge. The power of agility is greatly amplified for us in a raid environment with BoK and GoA.<br>

Of course DoT timers, Quartz and the like can track things like Mangle, Faerie Fire and Rip for us, but Demon can be useful for yelling at your Warriors for not keeping up Thunder Clap, or at your Warlocks for not using CoR (or if you have another Druid keeping up Mangle and Faerie Fire for you).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_504250"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->First of all, very good work with the summary. I'd like to do my part by providing a basic introduction to item evaluation.<br>
<br>
"How much attackpower is a percent crit worth ?<br>
<br>
Due to the fact that crit becomes better the more attackpower you have, it's impossible to say. The best you can do is to provide an estimate given a certain reference point. So if you say you have 3000 attackpower and 40 % crit you can make a relatively good estimate as to how much ap or crit influence your damage. Keep in mind this is only fairly accurate as long as your final values are not too far away from your reference point.<br>
<br>
As the exact gain from each point results in pretty weird numbers, it's often expressed in AEP (attackpower equivalence points). This basically means how much attackpower a point of the given stat is worth.<br>
<br>
I'm now giving some examples of AEP values for different reference points. I'm using my own calculator for it, other sources may differ (depending on how much factors they consider). Values in brackets are estimated for 2.3. and the upcoming HotW change.<br>
<br>
4973 AP/ 52.10% Crit, "Ultimate List 2.2.x" (1558 DPS)<br>
<br>
Attackpower: 1.0000 AEP (1.0000 AEP)<br>
Strength: 2.7192 AEP (2.2660 AEP)<br>
Agility: 3.1167 AEP (2.9363 AEP)<br>
Critrating: 2.0797 AEP (1.8906 AEP)<br>
Hitrating: 2.1996 AEP (2.0000 AEP)<br>
Armorignore: 0.4427 AEP (0.4025 AEP)<br>
Weapondamage: 11.1193 AEP (10.1085 AEP)<br>
Hasterating: 1.9330 AEP (1.7573 AEP)"<br>
<br>
I'll add some more gearsets to this soon, like Karazhan, T4 and T5.<br>
<br>
Edit: Hmm i just checked out ToskkDPS Calculator and figured it's probably easier to use -&gt; Link: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080405144516/http://druid.wikispaces.com/ToskksDPSGearMethod" target="_blank">The Druid Wiki » ToskksDPSGearMethod</a><!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_504269"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->In regards to Dukes awesome posts, I do have a few things I would like to bring up. I was wondering if anyone was aware that druids are not affected by Windfury totem. I spent 5 minutes killing trash with a shaman and her WF totem and I recieved 0 procs.<br>
<br>
I also have to question if Druids benefit from + weapon damage trinkets like <a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32654" target="_blank">[Crystalforged Trinket]</a> .Since we don't use a weapon, we do not get weapon procs. So how can we get + weapon damage. We do however benefit from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080405144516/http://thottbot.com/i22535" target="_blank">[Formula: Enchant Ring - Weapon Might]</a>, note the physical attacks in the description.<br>
<br>
I also have to comment on only using pure agility gems in your sockets. I have read the patch notes for 2.3 and see no change to HotW. Even so the art of feral is to have a combination of Strength and Agility on your gear. Strength is not something to pass up just to get more agility. There is such thing as too much crit, for crits generate more threat. As in a white crit of 400 will generate more threat than a white hit of 400. Doesn't help your dps if you have to Cower every 10 seconds. Also I have notice that when my crit gets over 40% im building up combo points to fast to stick the the DPS cycle. So I stay at 40% and just go for Strength to increase my attacks.<br>
<br>
And last time I checked. my stats raid buffed were 800 str, 650 agility, 4500 ap and 44% crit.<br>
I think the idea would be to get your crit to a certain point to maintain you dps rotation and work on AP after that.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Crits don't generate more threat than they do damage, i don't know how you got that idea. Thus, stacking crit instead of ap doesn't influence you threat if your dps is the same.<br>
<br>
Even if you sometimes have to shred despite already having 5cp, agility is still superior to strength - do the math yourself if you don't believe it.<br>

</div>Both will generate 280 points of threat (400x0.7 cat form threat multiplier), crits don't increase threat, you're just doing more damage which leads to unpredictable threat output (ie; crit strings which can often leave you to generating too much threat early on before the tank has had enough output).<br>

What is this change in 2.3? I have read nothing according to any change regarding agility and str. regardless strength is not something to be laughed at. In fact I only socket str for pvp since everyone has 250+ resiliance now. I know this is not the case for pve but is there such a thing as too much crit?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">In regards to Dukes awesome posts, I do have a few things I would like to bring up. I was wondering if anyone was aware that druids are not affected by Windfury totem. I spent 5 minutes killing trash with a shaman and her WF totem and I recieved 0 procs.<br>
<br>
I also have to question if Druids benefit from + weapon damage trinkets like <a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32654" target="_blank">[Crystalforged Trinket]</a> .Since we don't use a weapon, we do not get weapon procs. So how can we get + weapon damage. We do however benefit from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080405144516/http://thottbot.com/i22535" target="_blank">[Formula: Enchant Ring - Weapon Might]</a>, note the physical attacks in the description.<br>
<br>
I also have to comment on only using pure agility gems in your sockets. I have read the patch notes for 2.3 and see no change to HotW. Even so the art of feral is to have a combination of Strength and Agility on your gear. Strength is not something to pass up just to get more agility. There is such thing as too much crit, for crits generate more threat. As in a white crit of 400 will generate more threat than a white hit of 400. Doesn't help your dps if you have to Cower every 10 seconds. Also I have notice that when my crit gets over 40% im building up combo points to fast to stick the the DPS cycle. So I stay at 40% and just go for Strength to increase my attacks.<br>
<br>
And last time I checked. my stats raid buffed were 800 str, 650 agility, 4500 ap and 44% crit.<br>
I think the idea would be to get your crit to a certain point to maintain you dps rotation and work on AP after that.</div>

At 44% crit, you need at least 5k ap for 1 strength to be even close to 1 agility. Someone plotted a graphh separating the regions of agility vs strength, and I'll try to pull it up later<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<u><b>DPS Cycle</b></u><br>
The standard cycle is:<br>
Mangle -&gt; Shred to 5 combo points -&gt; Wait for 70+ energy (preferably 80+), Rip-&gt;Mangle, start again.<br>
<br>
Due to the way Rip scales with combo points, a four combo point rip is almost as effective as a 5 combo point rip (there is a static gain, AP doesn't scale between 4 and 5). This makes it quite effective to use a 4 combo point rip if your mangle has already run out (as a non-mangled shred is pretty pathetic in comparison to a mangled one).</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>While you mention that 4 CP is almost as effective as a 5 CP rip I think you're conveying here that people should use the Mangle, shred to 5 CP then rip as their standard option when they should not. <br>
<br>
The optimal cat form DPS cycle for a bleed vulnerable mob that won't die within 12 seconds is as follows:<br>
<br>
Mangle<br>
Shred to 4 CP, if you crit on 3 CP then you will get bonus damage on 5 CP for free.<br>
RIP<br>
<br>
Furor<br>
<br>
Rinse repeat.<br>
<br>
The important things to remember for this cycle is that furor will pay for a mangle immediately after your RIP finisher without having to wait for energy and will allow you to keep your 4 CP RIP cycle as close to 12 seconds as possible, wasting no energy to crits at 4 CP and taking 5 CP RIPs as a bonus.<br>
<br>
There are also a few other things to look for here like 2 piece T4 proc which if it procs near or after your RIP means you don't need to furor as you will gain the energy to mangle at the same rate and you can furor during your cycle or after your mangle to get the energy you need for 4 CP within 12 seconds.<br>
<br>
This method also allows you to control your energy "bleed", energy regen that exceeds your 100 energy limit, very well as the more you crit the less you need to shift and the easier it becomes to maintain a 12 second rip cycle. With tools like SCT or other debuff monitors it becomes quite easy to predict excess energy which can be converted to shreds as you meet 80 energy or will achived 100 energy within a second or so. <br>
<br>
It is often wise to execute a shred when you're sitting at 80 energy and about to tick to 100 as OoC can cause energy bleed over 100 and if you're wearing 2 piece T4 it can proc at any time. It is better to be sitting at 58 energy than get to 100 and proc 20 energy that immediately bleeds.<br>
<br>
Overall this is a good post and I like it. <!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_504366"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Your cycle screams all species of odd to me. You don't need to complicate things that much and your comments about 2t4 procs near the Rip meaning you don't need to powershift just eventuates in the standard "(mangle on first contact only) shred to 4/5, wait for energy, rip, mangle, repeat" cycle. Timing powershifts needs to be completely dynamic dependant on how many OoC procs, 2t4 procs and special crits you're getting. Crits at 4cp don't waste energy, they waste cp, which is perfectly acceptable if you're still mid-cycle and in danger of energy spillover.<br>
<br>
edit: The main benefit I can see of waiting for ~80 energy before Rip/Mangle is to make sure you have enough time to Shred up enough cp to minimize Rip downtime as much as possible IF none of your specials are critting and OoC/2t4 aren't proccing.<br>
<br>
After the powershift/Mangle you're now sitting at 0 energy at worst, or a partial tick amount of energy at best (due to the changes in energy tick mechanics). Whereas a Rip/Mangle at ~80 energy means you'll have ~30 energy leftover (80 - 30(Rip) - 40(Mangle) + 20(tick)) from the inevitable tick that would have happened in that time.<br>
<br>
Now, if that Mangle doesn't crit, and neither do your next 3 Shreds, you need to wait 14 seconds before you can build up 4 cp in the former case (i.e. lost Rip uptime) and only 10 seconds in the latter (no loss in Rip uptime).<br>
<br>
Another problem with powershifting after Rip is that you need to make sure you are as close to 30 energy as possible before Ripping or you'll waste energy powershifting.

Just a minor wording issue on the bear stuff. You say we need 156 defense to be uncrittable when you mean defense rating, usually (in my experience) the word "defense" alone refers to the skill. It'd be nice to see the magic 415 in there somewhere.<br>

		<div id="post_message_504409"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Thank you for writing this thread dukes, I had started reading the first 30ish pages of the Feral Druid Dps and the Bear Form Itemization thread and this is a much clearer summation of the things important to Feral Druids.<br>
<br>
In the 'talents to add' section you don't mention Intensity, now I am still leveling my Druid, but I was going to take Intensity for the reasons described <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080405144516/http://teethandclaws.blogspot.com/2007/09/threat-generation-factoring-rage.html" target="_blank">here</a>.<br>
Similar to the Cat form dps cycle, could you add a Bear form threat cycle? From what I understand from my guildies, it's:<br>
<br>
-In a low rage situation: Mangle, 3x Lacerate, repeat <br>
-In a high rage situation: Queue a Maul whenever possible, then interrupt this Maul with Mangle or Lacerate depending on cooldown, then requeue Maul.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>The reality of the DPS rotation is that complex when you take all factors into account. You "loose energy" from lost CP because it's not being included in building to the next round of finisher and the only time you should ever shred at 4 CP is when you're about to bleed energy. Alternatively you can quite easily call it loosing CP but I prefer to think of it as lost energy, that's just me.<br>
<br>
You only ever hold your energy in the rotation if you have 4 CP, you are not about to bleed energy and Rip is still on your target other wise a few things happen:<br>
<br>
Rip is not ticking on the target, you are loosing DPS and you're not building combo points to your next Rip. You use this method to make sure that Rip sticks to the target 24x7 and that your mangle debuff follows your Rip at all times or as above you're loosing DPS to not having Rip up and you're lossing DPS to not having mangle increase your Rip damage.<br>
<br>
It's worth pointing out you don't execute a furor if you have 50 or more energy when you rip as you will gain the 20 energy on your next tick, execute mangle when it would be executed any way from furor, then furor for energy. <br>
<br>
The options at 31 - 49 energy with 4 CP are: <br>
<br>
1) To either wait two energy ticks to be able to mangle with your rip and loose 4 seconds of Rip on the target - Worst.<br>
<br>
2) Execute Rip now and wait for the energy to fill - Bad.<br>
<br>
3) Execute Rip, Furor and mangle immediately as Rip takes 2 seconds for it's first tick- Best. You can still catch up your energy with another furor if you need to in that cycle if you don't crit, 2 piece T4 or OoC proc. <br>
<br>
"Cached" energy is a great thing and it's nice when you crit a lot and have OoC proc as you can just Rip then mangle, furor and shred and keep going but it doesn't always happen like that and your mana bar / pots / demonic runes etc with furor are what you use when you're not stacked up with it.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_504536"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->My apologies if these things have already been covered but the rating conversion page suggests the following:<br>
<br>
Haste Rating: 10.5 rating grants 1% haste<br>
<br>
Spell Haste Rating: 21 rating grants 1% spell haste <br>
<br>
I thought that they were both changed to grant 1% haste from 15.7 rating or so, if this is indeed the case perhaps a notification should be written next to the link explaining this.<br>

<br>
Secondly the Lower City head enchant's exact values are 17 strength / 16 intellect.<br>

Is it worth putting a note of how much benefit SotF gives you and how much def/resil you would need to overcome the loss of 1 point in the talent - it's not something I'd ever consider doing, but I have heard of people considering it, &amp; I guess it would be useful if you ever had to OT something while only having 21 points in feral or something.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_504562"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Fantastic post. Great summary, and very useful. A few suggestions below.<br>
<br>
I think it would be valuable to indicate which pieces of t4 are the most valuable to keep for the 2pc t4 bonus, since it is one of the most common questions people will have. Apparently it's helm and shoulders preferrably, then I'm not sure.<br>
<br>
Re: Raven Goddess I know it's obvious but maybe add something about the fact that you have to be in a full melee group for it to be valuable. Since we don't get WF procs, I often see that the melee group in a 25-man raid is 2x dps warriors + 2x rogues + enh shaman. And the druids are in another group with a couple other melee characters, maybe tanks. In which case the benefit of the Raven Goddess goes way down. And maybe add something about idols for bears, with Raven Goddess being situational, and Brutality and Wild being quite good with a preference for brutality especially in infinite rage fights. In particular remind everybody that Ursoc is crap.<br>
<br>
Re: trinkets, I thought the Darkmoon: Crusade was also quite comparable to some of the trinkets you quote (i.e. somewhere around 115-120 AEP). Maybe also add something about the 2 main variants of trinkets: user-triggered, and RNG-triggered - and how druids seem to have split opinions on this issue, with RNG-triggered trinkets often looking better on paper, but some druids preferring to have the control of when the on use effect is triggered as to not lose any on use uptime. Also in the summary maybe just say to check the list above, because some high-ish trinkets are not that good, e.g. Living Root.<br>
<br>
In the summary, for feral weapon skill I would emphasise the sweet spot at &gt; 19.5 rating (where you get exactly +5 weapon skill) which gives the best value for money (3% hit and some -dodge).<br>
<br>
Maybe rephrasing the WF part in the summary to make it clearer, I would start with "WF doesn't proc in cat form, but wouldn't be overpowered..."<br>
<br>
Finally maybe a bit of a newbish reminder, but re: enchants it might be worth reminding people that weapon "on hit" enchants don't work in forms, and that armor enchants/kits are not multiplied by bear form.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Similar to the Cat form dps cycle, could you add a Bear form threat cycle? From what I understand from my guildies, it's:<br>
<br>
-In a low rage situation: Mangle, 3x Lacerate, repeat <br>
-In a high rage situation: Queue a Maul whenever possible, then interrupt this Maul with Mangle or Lacerate depending on cooldown, then requeue Maul.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>Mauls are "On Next Hit". Mangle and Lacerate are instant and don't ever come in the way of Maul (or vice versa).<br>
<br>
Highest single target threat cycle is<br>
<br>
Mangle, Lacerate (x3). Use excess rage to queue Mauls every single time.<br>
<br>
Feral Faerie Fire might seem nice, but costs you a global cooldown. Similarly, Demo Roar seems nice but costs you a global cooldown and a Warrior's Shout will override it (Druid: -240 AP untalented, -336 talented; Warrior: -300 AP untalented, -450 talented). You might need these two in normal 5man runs, but it's unlikely you'll be using them on a raid Boss fight.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Idol of the Raven Goddess may decrease in value, but things become complicated when you consider the fact that hunters have various abilities that trigger from crits, on top of the straight dps gains from them.  BM hunter pets trigger a 3% damage buff for the whole party (and a 30% haste buff for themselves) when they crit, and LotP is one of the few ways that a hunter can boost pet crit rates.  Survival hunters trigger expose weakness (which boosts physical dps for the entire raid) from crits, and regain mana when their special attacks crit.<br>
<br>
Again, this is not to say I disagree with the conclusion, as my math fu is far too weak to evaluate it.  But crit nevertheless can have damage boosting effects that one might not anticipate at first.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>That's all that changed at the "top" level where you can socket everything for DPS. There are a lot of in-between DPS items between T5 and T6, and compromises made with T6, that show how items may have value where they previously didn't. <br>

In the short-term, note that <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28506" target="_blank">[Gloves of Dexterous Manipulation]</a> increased their lead on everything besides T6. <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32235" target="_blank">[Cursed Vision of Sargeras]</a> becomes obscenely better than any other option, as opposed to significantly better.

 <br>
The top isn't different, but the steps getting there definitely are.  Essentially-- anything with AGI, AP, and sockets all got better than they were before. Items with all 3 got significantly buffed relative to "feral" items with STR/AGI.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_505407"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->With my numbers until you can get T6 level gear, (oddly enough) it goes roughly like chest, hat, shoulders, gloves, pants.  In 2.3, the engineering hat becomes more viable, and so you can swap it with the shoulders.  It's a bit of a muchness.   The T4 pants are certainly the weakest of the pieces for dps.  <br>
<br>
There still issues with a lot of random epics, because they don't have agility on them, so while Bloodsea for example might be better than t4, it's only marginally so, and mainly due to item level and the wasted stats on the t4.<br>
<br>
ETA:  <br>
There's no section for bear trinkets.  Just that comment in the living root entry.  <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32658" target="_blank">[Badge of Tenacity]</a> is probably a better trinket to use if you're switching because it's activateable.<br>
<br>
As I understand it, lacerate crits will only increase the base damage component of it rather than the bonus threat, and more importantly, that initial application can be blocked, which because it's doing low damage can result in the whole hit being blocked and no threat applied.<br>
<br>
You can't completely ignore the DoT component.  Fully stacked, even at a 20% threat modifier they do in total about the same threat as the initial application.  That's why you maintain it on mobs that are vulnerable to bleed effects.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_505677"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I thought lacerate bleed threat was 10%, not 20%.  Testing when it was changed tot he current version showed sunder armor level inital threat.  Has that changed?<br>
<br>
Clarifying a few points.  <br>
<br>
The reason + hit is good for druids is twofold.  First, nifty things like the Hourglass, 2T4, and Omen only work when you hit.  Missing dilutes their effectiveness.  Second, ferals will average energy-to-damage conversion rates around 30-50, from karazhan to T6.  This means that every missed shred or mangle is costing you around 270-450 lost damage and a missed rip is very painful.  This energy conversion rate is much higher than rogues, and is the reason 2T4 is so good.  Every proc is another 600-1000 damage.<br>
<br>
The Shapeshifter's Signet gives you an effective 3% hit against boss and other 73 mobs, plus possibly other unknown bonuses.  This makes it extremely efficient, and it it still useful even if you dps with a Earthwarden.  On the other hand, 10% ap makes rogue gear competitive for many slots and it usually has an abundance of hit.<br>
<br>
Next is an examination of the differences between the various tier pieces and which are the best to use at any particular point.  The easy answer is to wear whichever T4 pieces you can't fill in with T5 or better.  <br>
<br>
The medium answer is always wear things with more sockets, like T6 gloves and T5&amp;6 legs.<br>
<br>
The long answer goes into a semi-detailed examination of the various pieces' stats as compared among the tiers.  Here is the total stat changes for each piece in total stats as you advance along the tier sets.  Socketing is so that each set, T4, 5 and 6, will activate a RED meta and yellows are always filled with pure hit gems.  Mix and matching pieces will shuffle gems around a bit but shouldn't create major differences.  Chests are always socketed for bonuses since they eat a yellow and a blue, T4 and T6 helm socket bonuses are included and T5 shoulders.  <br>
<br>
Helms:<br>
T5 +5 str, +4 agi, -8 hit<br>
T6 +16 str, +6 agi, -8 hit<br>
<br>
Shoulders:<br>
T5 +5 str, -1 agi, +8 hit<br>
T6 +6 str, +5 agi, +8 hit<br>
<br>
Chest:<br>
T5 +17 str, -4 agi, -4 hit<br>
T6 +24 str, +2 agi, -4 hit<br>
<br>
Legs:<br>
T5 +4 str, +13 agi, +18 hit<br>
T6 +11 str, +17 agi, +27 hit<br>
<br>
Gloves:<br>
T5 +3 str, +3 agi<br>
T6 +7 str, +16 agi<br>
<br>
The hit diffences in the helms and shoulder are due to gem placements.  T4 helm gets a hit gem, while they go in shoulders for the other tier sets.  While individual placement may vary, while wearing T5 the best T4 pieces are clearly the gloves and the shoulders, although using the shoulders requires shifting a hit gem.  While wearing T6 things get a little more complicated.  Wearing shoulders and helm only costs you 22 str and just 11 agi while socketing your second yellow for the lovely T4 helm bonus.  Shoulders and chest costs you 30 str yet only 7 agi while gaining 4 hit, but requires moving a yellow gem somewhere.<br>
<br>
Incidentally, this also shows that T5&amp;6 legs and T6 gloves are extremely good and are the best pieces in their respective sets.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Lacerate applications that are wholly blocked still refresh/increase the stack.  I haven't been able to systematically test whether the threat is still applied, nor seen any tests to that effect.  If the block is mitigation in the same sense as dodge or parry, then it would make sense that the bonus initial threat isn't applied, but by the same reasoning, it doesn't make sense that the stack is refreshed.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_505770"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Re: Lacerate<br>
<br>
I was just going by the wowwiki description, but looking at the code for the latest version of the ace threat lib, it also has the values of 285 base threat, and then a 20% modifier on all damage.  Lacerate doesn't scale with AP, so the maximum average threat you're likely to get when attacking is about 300 threat.  Swipe on the other hand does scale with AP, with 7% of AP being added to your base damage.  If you have good enough AP, crit and to get your average swipe damage up to more than 300 damage then it will generate more threat per attack than lacerate.<br>
<br>
The issue is also complicated by blocks and weapon skill.  Pretty much every TBC boss has a chance of blocking and will block for more than lacerate hits for and in those cases it generates no threat.  Having weapon skill helps, but even at the infamous +5 level it doesn't negate block completely.<br>
<br>
The lacerate threat issue was discussed in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080412173404/http://elitistjerks.com/f31/t13204-bear_tank_item_comparisons/p43/" target="_blank">bear tanking thread</a>. Dukes came to the conclusion you need to do about 225 average damage (non crit) to generate more threat.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Re: Lacerate<br>
<br>
I was just going by the wowwiki description, but looking at the code for the latest version of the ace threat lib, it also has the values of 285 base threat, and then a 20% modifier on all damage.  Lacerate doesn't scale with AP, so the maximum average threat you're likely to get when attacking is about 300 threat.  Swipe on the other hand does scale with AP, with 7% of AP being added to your base damage.  If you have good enough AP, crit and to get your average swipe damage up to more than 300 damage then it will generate more threat per attack than lacerate.<br>
<br>
The issue is also complicated by blocks and weapon skill.  Pretty much every TBC boss has a chance of blocking and will block for more than lacerate hits for and in those cases it generates no threat.  Having weapon skill helps, but even at the infamous +5 level it doesn't negate block completely.<br>
<br>
The lacerate threat issue was discussed in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080412173409/http://elitistjerks.com/f31/t13204-bear_tank_item_comparisons/p43/" target="_blank">bear tanking thread</a>. Dukes came to the conclusion you need to do about 225 average damage (non crit) to generate more threat.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>My personal standards for lacerate and swipe back when it seemed to be nearly comparable in threat - <br>
<br>
Bleed immune I will swipe at 180 damage.<br>
<br>
Non-Bleed immune I will swipe at 200 damage.<br>
<br>
I used these numbers and not the 225 from Dukes stats simply because I feel I tank with a higher crit rate than most other bears. <br>
<br>
Since I have gotten 4pt6 and my swipes often push 250 to 300 I will only ever Lacerate on mobs that are taking ridiculously low damage from melee attacks, the only one I can think of at the moment is the Bloodboil trash during shield wall phases. I use Lacerate so rarely at this point that it is quite near Rake is usefulness, preventing rogues from restealthing or vanishing in the arenas or world pvp. <br>
<br>
Lacerate seems to be more of a spam tanking ability for non-ferals that hop into bear to hold aggro on something, and not an ability that we (ferals) are supposed to use for raiding.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I don't go into the non-set items because they tend to drastically complicate the discussion.  It was intended strictly to illustrate the best T4 pieces to wear as compared to T5&amp;6.  Besides, those are all not 5 piece slots and not what I was talking about.  While you can shuffle some gems off into those pieces, and you should, the primary effect of wearing those on the analysis is shifting the hit differences on the helms and shoulders into agility differences.  Or str/crit differences in the case of the T4 helm, but that's the only place I'd voluntarily put a str/crit gem.  <br>
<br>
As for hit, I believe very strongly that you should always be hit capped when possible.  Even for ferals, my spreadsheet shows better returns point for point than anything else even though hit doesn't have the overwhelming lead that it does for rogues.  Yes, you can use agi/hit gems if you want to cut some hit, but that doesn't really change the comparisons a whole lot except in helm/shoulder differences and those aren't exactly major.  Yes, str/crit gems can be used instead if you already happen to be hit capped but they're pretty bad as opposed to the other yellow options.  I've always had to struggle to get to the hit cap, but my raid runs 4 rogues, 2 dps warriors, a enh shaman, and 4 hunters in the roster so getting hit jewelry was not easy.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

• Expertise: We have added a new stat and associated rating called expertise and expertise rating. Expertise rating converts to expertise at the same rate that weapon skill rating formerly converted at. Each point of expertise reduces the chance for your attacks to be dodged or parried by 0.25%<br>
<br>
• Weapon Skill: All items and abilities that granted weapon skill have been changed. In most cases, they were converted to expertise or expertise rating. Ranged attacks do not benefit from expertise, so ranged weapon skill has generally been replaced by critical strike bonuses or hit bonuses. In a few cases, talents have been changed to other effects to avoid granting players excessive amounts of expertise.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
• Expertise: We have added a new stat and associated rating called expertise and expertise rating. Expertise rating converts to expertise at the same rate that weapon skill rating formerly converted at. Each point of expertise reduces the chance for your attacks to be dodged or parried by 0.25%<br>
<br>
• Weapon Skill: All items and abilities that granted weapon skill have been changed. In most cases, they were converted to expertise or expertise rating. Ranged attacks do not benefit from expertise, so ranged weapon skill has generally been replaced by critical strike bonuses or hit bonuses. In a few cases, talents have been changed to other effects to avoid granting players excessive amounts of expertise.</div>

</div>Yes, that pretty much murdered the needs for any skill rating, 5 points of expertise will now reduce dodge by 1.25%, 2.5% total avoidance if you include parry.<br>

		<div id="post_message_507092"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Hey Dukes.<br>
<br>
You might probably want to include my article about Strength versus Agility in your post if you like. Its theorycrafting, but provides decent arguments to compare Strength and Agility for Raid DPS.<br>
<br>
Given, its written pre-2.3 HotW change, but my conclusion was Agility &gt;&gt; Strength in terms of raid DPS for the average geared druid. Since the AP value of agility increases by 10% and the AP value of strength decreases by 1/12th, the graph should still hold true, only favoring agility even more.<br>
<br>
You can read my article here:<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080412173409/http://druid.wikispaces.com/AthinirasCorner#tocAthinirasCorner2" target="_blank">The Druid Wiki » AthinirasCorner</a><br>
<br>
...as well as you can read Tossk DPS gear methodology here:<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080412173409/http://druid.wikispaces.com/ToskksDPSGearMethod" target="_blank">The Druid Wiki » ToskksDPSGearMethod</a><br>
<br>
To sum up however, the general conclusion is that because that attack power scales much faster than critical strike chance when you achieve new upgrades (Feral AP weapons etc.), as well as raid buffs, the value of agility compared to strength drastically increases in the favor of agility since druids generally take a great bunch of Attack Power in, making agility overall more valuable for DPS.<br>
<br>
Excellent post overall, keep up the good work. Once you feel the thread is finished, ill add it to the Druid Wiki.<br>
<br>
Reading from the information you provided, you already stated agility as the best DPS stat. But if you want to link the two articles above feel free to do so.<br>
<br>
In addition, i would heavily recommend you introduce people to Rawr as well. Its a program for calculating the value of druid tanking items.<br>

</div>Someone turned me onto Rawr last night, and I have to say, its a wonderful program.  It allows you to create your own profile, or just download straight from the armory.  One of the greatest things is not only does it rate the gear based on just "points", but further separates those points as survival and avoidance, and updates based upon how all of your gear stacks up.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Can you try /cancelform + potion/healthstone macros while being attacked? While being attacked by a fast hitting mob? While being attacked by multiple fast hitting mobs? Take a /combatlog so we can see if there are any hits in caster form.<br>

<br>
Thoughts: at this stage it appears that they're itemised (like our existing gear) with the pre 2.3 setup, so have more strength than agility and also strength gem bonuses.   Most of the  items appear to be around ilevel 128, so are t5 equivalent.   As far as tanking there are items for the 3 non-set slots, chest and cloak.  There's also an idol with a chance to proc an agility bonus on mangle (okayish I guess, but a tanking idol should ideally be fixed).  The new pvp idol is probably better for tanking though, 31 resilience on mangle but only for 6 seconds, so I guess it's a bit like shield block.<br>
<br>
I wonder how easy it would be to convince blizzard to switch the str and agility on all our items (and socket bonuses).<br>
<br>
ETA most of the above is badge loot.  World of raids has it here: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080412173414/http://www.worldofraids.com/news/october/2.3/items/new-heroic-leather.jpg" target="_blank">http://www.worldofraids.com/news/oct...ic-leather.jpg</a><br>

</div>Thinking in terms of what loot people, who would expect to find possible upgrades amongst this badge loot, those vestments seem at first glance to stack up quite poorly against the <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=29096" target="_blank">[Breastplate of Malorne]</a> and is arguably worse than good old <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=25689" target="_blank">[Heavy Clefthoof Vest]</a> for tanking due to the, at that level of gear, real need for substantial stamina, as well being possibly inferior to <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33204" target="_blank">[Shadowprowler's Chestguard]</a> for dps. Does 5 agility, 14 strength, and 150 armour penetration really beat 24 agility and 8 hit rating?  I'm at a loss for why the designers would choose to make the most expensive item slot badge item be without sockets for leather.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_507899"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Agreed.  Colour me unimpressed atm.  Although given the recent changes to HotW and FAP I live in hope of some of those items being buffed.<br>
<br>
Due to lack of sockets the chest is only comparable to the t4 one, and the belt is too hybrid to be of much use  (weaker than the druid crafted one for tanking and the rogue crafted on for dps).  The bracers are probably a tanking upgrade, but ask you to find more defense somewhere else (over the veteran's ones).   The boots are better than the crafted ones because of the sockets, but not noticeably.  In someways I'd be more keen to take some of the rogue items.<br>
<br>
As for the other stuff, the feral idols are okayish, although for the badge one it will depend on the proc rate (the arena one might be better for tanking lol).  The cloak is good, but once again is frustrating because of the lack of defence, so I'd just about prefer the illhoof one.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

1% less dodge is 4 expertise, which translate into 16 expertise rating. So they are roughly the same, with hit rating being better.<br>

		<div id="post_message_507987"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I'm honestly very unimpressed and one step closer to switching over to my fury warrior. ZA is gonna make or break the deal. <br>
<br>
You can view the data mined ZA weapon models on mmo-champion, only one looks like it could possibly be a new feral weapon, the one with the Dragonhawk on top. Most of the loot is meant to be around T5 so I'm hoping that they'll make it a DPS staff but again this is Blizzard we are talking about and their logic could quite possibly go:<br>
Karazhan 10 man had DPS staff.<br>
Next 10 man must have Tanking staff.<br>
<br>
I am fairly impressed with the belt (367 armour, 29 str, 28 agi, 30 stam, 18 hit, BR sockets(+3 str)) though, I would really have loved it when I was at that level of gear. But its not much point with Deep Shadows for dps and Veterans/Natural Grace for tanking now. But for the level it is aimed at I think its a great item. <br>
<br>
The Chest piece is a wierd one, as said above its pretty crap for tanking compared to T4 and even Clefthoof but I don't even think I'd take it for DPS above my shadowprowlers. Possibly if I hadn't bought Shadowprowler's already AND there wasn't a ton of other better ways to spend heroic items this patch but either one of these factors kind of renders it obsolete. <br>
<br>
The wrist piece is okay for a DPS piece. For tanking I'd be loathe to lose my Veteran's due to its massive resilience going a long way to getting you crit capped in one item.<br>
The wrists (21 str, 22agi, Y): <br>
(assuming sotf, hotw, bok, 8agi gem)<br>
21x2x1.1x1.03x1.1= 52.3446 AP<br>
30x1.1x1.03x1.1= 37.389 AP<br>
<br>
Total stats:<br>
89.7 AP (89.7336)<br>
1.2% crit<br>
<br>
Compared to <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32647" target="_blank">[Shard-bound Bracers]</a> under the same conditions:<br>
<br>
28x1.1x1.03x1.1= 34.8964 AP<br>
42x1.1= 46.2<br>
<br>
Gives:<br>
81.1 AP (81.0964)<br>
1.12 AP<br>
<br>
So the badge loot gives 8 more ap and 0.08% crit. Not an earthshattering leap but when you throw in the higher stamina and the 10 int I think its a solid purchase should you have any serious upgrades you want from the new heroic loot. Definately going on the shopping list. <br>
<br>
Might also pick up the boots for tanking (still rolling with Zierhut's) but I think Edgewalkers still beat these for DPS. At a quick glance they both have the same agility, the same number of sockets and two bonus you aren't going to really bother with (though if lacking hit the footwraps offer a nice option of hit/agi gem, agi gem and +3 str bonus). <br>
<br>
So the difference is really 29 strength and the non dps stats vs 44 ap and 13 hit.<br>
<br>
29x2x1.1x1.03x1.1 = 72.2854<br>
44x1.1= 48.4<br>
<br>
So it comes down to the hit rating really. If the 13 hit rating is worth more to you than the 25 or so AP then keep Edgemasters, else this is actually a pretty decent upgrade. Colour me suprised.<br>
<br>
But to be honest the only item that screams out at me from the heroic list is the cloak, and partially only because I'm fed up of looking at Gilded Thorium.<br>
<br>
<br>
Edit: <br>
<br>
Browsing WoWhead it shows the new Idol to be a 85% proc rate. You can bet your lifesavings thats gonna mean a hefty Internal CD <!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I don't have them on me, but I can tell you what it probably is: 1010 FAP since the old is 788.<br>
<br>
It looks like a simple change of scaling modifier by (iLvl, rarity) from 1H to 2H, which means that whatever the FAP on your epic FAP weapon is now, the new one is approximately 1.282 times the old one (actual factor something between 1.281 and 1.282).<br>
<br>
-----<br>
<br>
It also looks after a quick reverse calculation as if all the new badge loot is of item level 128. <br>
<br>
That makes me possibly even sadder about the badge druid chestpiece - even without making it an 8 item levels higher copy of Malorne, it <i>should</i> have been possible to design it such that it would blow either Shadowprowler's (23 item levels lower) or Heavy Clefthoof (14 item levels and one rarity level lower) out of the water or, failing that, at least provide a viable alternative to both of them, if it had to be made as a hybrid piece of gear.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

In that sense if it had been 8 levels higher than T4 we could've socketed it for tanking.<br>

Pretty sure there's heaps for ZA loot to be found so we might get some stuff there.<br>

		<div id="post_message_508241"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I'm actually more curious about the new arena idol in a tanking sense.  Theoretically if you had perfect timing and no latency you could use it as an anti-crit mechanism for tanking, a bit like (but less successful than) shield block.  Certainly if they buffed the duration by a second or two.<br>
<br>
Of course that's a really silly idea, because you're going to get stunned or whatever and bam you lose you anti-crit, but at least you have some control over that idol.<br>
<br>
A proc based mangle idol (probably too low like all our other mangle based procs) isn't really the best fit for tanking.  Ideally it should be more like either or both parts of the badge of tenacity, although an activatable effect doesn't make much sense.<br>
<br>
While I'm not sure they've addressed the scaling issue completely, it does kind of seem like we should be able to find some useful dps gear now.  Unfortunately the same can't be said for the tanking gear.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>If the proc rate on the mangle idol is good enough (wowhead is showing 85% but that seems a tad high) thats an extra ~4.5% dodge which is pretty sweet. <br>
<br>
Just some notes after running some numbers:<br>
<br>
The BoJ rogue gloves seem to come out better than T6 gloves (minus the set bonus) using the numbers Malazaar posted and consequently quite a bit better than anything else Pre-T6. Similarly the rogue boots are only about 6 AP below Shadowmaster's boots making them very good as well. Also the BoJ rogue legs are better than T5 druid legs for dps.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>It may blow most idols out of the water but the Everbloom idol is pretty insane. <br>
<br>
Using Tossk's prototype calculator for 2.3 with a base of:<br>
<br>
4500 AP<br>
48% crit<br>
9% hit<br>
RED Metagem and 2T4<br>
No idol<br>
<br>
We get:<br>
1316.85 DPS<br>
<br>
Adding in Everbloom idol we get:<br>
1341.82 DPS<br>
<br>
Adding in 26 Agi gives:<br>
1334.821 DPS (assuming Kings)<br>
<br>
Doing some quick backwards math we need the Idol to give a static ~37 Agi for it to be on par with the Everbloom idol which would mean an ~57% uptime needed. I dont have the formula to determine uptime handy but Im sure someone can convert that to a proc % for us.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_508467"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I really don't understand why people want to dilute loot table further and/or cry when they don't get their drops, when they can just fix class mechanics so that at least two classes can share the same drops?

</div>Based on the official description of expertise, I'd say yes:<br>
<br>
As cat you'll fight only gain one benefit, anti-dodge, unless you get your expertise high enough that the anti-parry is larger than a mob's parry value, at which point you could in principle attack it from in front (which you are not going to do anyhow, because you want to shred, but the inherent possibility is there - that particular hypothetical is probably of more interest to rogues with combat-swords build).<br>
<br>
You'll be able to achieve a higher total reduction in attacks that don't land since the expertise substracts from other portions of the "I'm not hitting stuff" than hit rating does. That's not just good, it is potentially great, but it comes at the cost of having to achieve your 9% hit solely through hit rating gear. In conclusion, you can get a better total reduction in the number of attacks that don't do damage than in 2.2 but it makes more gear to achieve it.<br>
<br>
For tanking or praticularly offtanking feral weapon skill was bloody marvelous, and, again based on the official description of it, it still looks bloody marvelous - just in a different way. Sure, it won't give you as many more harm-dealing blows vs a L73 as weapon skill would (3% for 5 weapon skill), but reducing the mobs ability to parry by 1.25 % is almost worth it by itself without even considering the dodge reduction. I'm pretty sure that we all hate mobs parrying us, especially those unfortunate parry streaks that occasionally do happena and can turn a merely bad situation into a nightmare.<br>
<br>
The interesting thing is, of course, whether it works in practice the way it is described in the patch notes. <!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>No AP is better for scaling than STR, it should be placed in Preditory Strikes and not Heart of the Wild. Changing Strength is more or less a slap in the face to all the itemization up until this point.

</div>Part of me shares your viewpoint (You probably can find some old posts on the Feral threads telling various people why making feral spec have an AP multiplier vs a Strength multiplier was a 'bad idea') but as it is, there are more options.<br>
<br>
Feral loot almost universally has int and armor tacked on. Previously, even with those drains on item budget, it came out around to 'the same' DPS value as rogue loot due to the fact that Strength was 20% better (not counting kings/sotf yet) and AP was just plain shit.<br>
<br>
Now that Str and AP are more balanced in terms of DPS value, rogue loot with no item points spent on AC/int will definitely come out farther. It doesn't make aforementioned feral-specific loot obsolete though, just shifts its focus more clearly into a tanking or hybrid raid role.<br>
<br>
After I got over lamenting the death of the feral druid's itemization niche, it really seems that much better to have -guaranteed- itemization in future, regardless how many upgrade tiers go in the game.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_509557"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->That staff is pretty disappointing. I think many like me had high hopes for a feral staff in Z'A and probably hoping for an upgraded version of the squid-stick and not a downgraded version of the pillar. Most of the new items seems fairly well itemized so I don't know why we need 70 stamina on what seems to be a dps-oriented weapon.<br>
<br>
I'll of course try to get it anyway and hope for a redistribution of stat points even if it doesn't happen before the patch goes live.<br>
<br>
<a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33479" target="_blank">Grimgrin Faceguard</a> looks fairly nice, but I wonder if it will be used at all with the absence of a meta socket.<br>

<br>
From the list on wowhead I see one feral item in ZA, and it's the above mentioned weapon.  As badge rewards there are maybe one or two pieces that would be small tanking upgrades for your typical raid doing T5 content.  The other interesting items are all rogue items, which at least they've started itemising with agility more of the time.<br>
<br>
I'm actually really interested in seeing the season three feral set, that's the one thing that they've added to the list since the other changes came out, and so our one hope that they actually understand the consequences of the way they've changed things.  Sure it's for arenas so there's going to be some arena stats on there, but hopefully it will have a good amount of agility and less strength as well as no intellect and healing.<br>
<br>
I need to think about it a bit more but I'm not convince that they can itemise hybrid stuff for us any more without it being greatly inferior for dps.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_509637"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->If this is what we get, then I have little hope for us ever getting any type of proper weapon for DPS. Don't get me wrong, all of the other feral changes are absolutely amazing. I just don't think it's unreasonable to get a semi-optimally itemized weapon. It's just mind boggling that anyone comes up with this itemization formula. <br>
<br>
The S3 staff is the new PVE weapon to get. I'm not big into arena, and I don't' think it's worth the effort to try to maintain that rating for a slight upgrade over season two maul. <br>
<br>
Here's hoping that they added an unprecedented two feral weapons to the ZA loot tables. Maybe the timed epic quest yields a T6 equivalent feral DPS weapon. I guess it's too early to say, but regardless it doesn't change the fact that the new weapon is close to useless.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>You have a personal rating, and due to the design of Arenas, in which ideal point net gain = 0 (of course, people abandon low rating teams, skewing that number), you are correct about the fact that only some people can get to 1850 personal rating and get the weapon.<br>

</div>While some players, like yourself, may be able to get a high enough rating to score the new weapon there are others who can't or who aren't interested in arena's.<br>
I have had a go at arena's now and I did get a bit better with more familiarity but with a <i>good ping</i> being 400ms and my normal ping being 500ms they are more an exercise in frustration, especially as a melee class.<br>

I think it's a bug which we should get on their ass about on the PTR forums. Need to make some noise about this so they can look into the issue.<br>

edit: Quick search on the PTR forums turned up a few threads. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080412173429/http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=2366568105" target="_blank">This one</a> seems to have the most activity so I'm going to hijack it.

		<div id="post_message_511208"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->So, trying to figure out how good the new idol is for tanking I used it while smacking my favorite punching bags, the skettis trees, to test expertise.<br>
<br>
Like mentioned earlier the idol cannot refresh the buff, so I parsed out procs from the mangles done with no buff on.<br>
<br>
In 421 mangles I had 224 procs for a rate of 53.2%. Small sample size applies, but it seems like it will be by far my preferred tanking idol once the patch goes live - unless something insane gets dropped into Z'A. The idol is also dirt cheap at 20 badges.<br>
<br>
To quickly test the proc rate in cat I ran out today to lay waste to the ashtongue camp in SMV (level 69-70). Here I had 127 procs in 136 mangles (93.4%). Sample size applies even more here, but it does seem like the rate is higher for mangle in cat form. I don't quite know what kind of proc rate we'd need for the idol to surpass Everbloom in a raid environment (I think the needed uptime was posted earlier, but I'll let someone else do the heavy brain lifting).<br>
<br>
All in all it seems like a very good idol.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_511212"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->It seems to me that it might be worth taking the GCD hit to swap the Idol of Terror in and out with the Everbloom Idol,  Mangle &gt; Switch to Everbloom Idol &gt; Shred to 5 Combo Points &gt; Switch to Idol of Terror (usually waiting for energy ticks here if you didn't powershift, or could work the switch in with the shift?) &gt; Rip &gt; Mangle ... Repeat ad infinitum.<br>
<br>
This way, if it doesn't proc you can regain the damage lost by not having it proc with the increased shred damage.  Although if the proc rate is high enough such that there is a good chance it will always be up each mangle it probably isn't worth it?  Thoughts?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Actually, I will be throwing this into my rotation. Quartz swing timer will be my friend. Hit a macro to Rip and equip the Idol of Terror as a swing starts. Mangle as a swing starts, with a macro to idol swap to Everbloom. Overall, losing MAYBE 0.4s of one white hit.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<!-- message -->
		<div id="post_message_511393"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I'm still trying to get understand how this patch affects our scaling and how far we are along the  path to where we should be.  Certainly the FAP and HotW changes bring us much closer to where we should be with respect to rogue dps and (at least new) itemisation.  All new rogue leather has agility on it when previously over a quarter including the only high-level non-set piece drops in some slots had no agility on them.  The expertise change is probably a net benefit for us, as it means that there are more items available for us to get the stat from, although like everyone we will need to get more hit rating from somewhere.<br>
<br>
My concern then shifts to feral tanking, and tanking itemisation.   Unfortunately here things haven't changed much, and in several ways have perhaps regressed a bit since 2.2.  While 2.3 was supposed to help fill in off-spec itemisation, it has really only added PvE itemisation for our relic and bracer slots, and only at a relatively low item level.  (Also the relic isn't a tanking relic per se).  <br>
<br>
The main issue is that our tanking gear is in fact hybrid gear and also poorly itemised hybrid gear at that, with the HotW change it no longer competes with the (agility based) rogue alternatives for dps purposes, it is also suboptimally itemised for tanking, especially at the high-end (swapping the agility and strength on t5 and t6 would buff both tanking and dps with no change to item value).  While you could argue that intellect is of some small use when dpsing, it has no value when tanking, and yet it's on all our prime tanking gear.<br>
<br>
However I think the problems go beyond that.   We struggle to get tanking stats outside of agility, bonus armour and stamina.  Too many tanking items are of little use for us, and very few stack our core tanking stats with other useful ones.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Anyhow, if you cant remove it, maby you could make a new macro including the <br>

</div>I'm using the 9% number more or less intuitively for a couple of reasons<br>
<br>
1.There's very few DPS out there that actually can give us the numbers for expertise. Enhancement Shaman and DPS warrior, that's not with the corresponding weapon skill will work. I'll look into this since I do raid with an alt Enhancement Shaman<br>
<br>
2.Realistically, one won't be able to stack expertise to the degree of 9%. So while it's a nice number to look at, it can only overshoot, and not undershoot.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I'm still trying to get understand how this patch affects our scaling and how far we are along the  path to where we should be.  Certainly the FAP and HotW changes bring us much closer to where we should be with respect to rogue dps and (at least new) itemisation.</div>

	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>As far as I can see, the changes do not bring us particularly closer to where "we should be" with regards to rogue dps - what it does is make existing itemization more convenient for us.<br>
<br>
The net effect of the changes is that every FAP weapon has about 28.2% more FAP than before. That gain in FAP is of roughly the same scale as the loss in AP from HotW not affecting STR (STR*2.72-2.26), give or take a few dozen AP. With +10% AP applied to the sum of the changes (and thus regaining some of what was lost as well as working on FAP, buffs, agility..), you are going to, again broadly and it differs with gear level, in particular how much rogue gear you were already wearing, going to see something like a total 5-15% increase in AP when raidbuffed.<br>
<br>
That may seem like a lot, but as has been demonstrated often enough, the feral druid's real scaling problem is not a lack of AP - it is being very poor at transforming raw AP into damage. Druids are not going to scale a lot better because of this change, merely a little better: those 80-95% of your new AP that was your old AP don't scale one whit better with gear, but at least there'll be more items of interest to us and you will have that bit of extra AP.<br>
<br>
Not that you couldn't solve the scaling issue via AP by making high-end gear provide high amounts of AP (though it would be difficult to set up without letting low-end gear, where the current setup works quite well, get unbalanced), it is just that addressing it via a change to our talents/abilities seem more likely.<br>
<br>
From a practical perspective, something like the FAP and HotW change are much more in line with sops thrown to the players, since this is what players complained the loudest about (lack on STR on gear, our "2Hs" scaling worse than others' "2Hs"), than really addressing scaling issues.  Furthermore, you couldn't really make the HotW change without the FAP change (or another change increasing AP in general) or you would be reducing the AP of a lot of druids in the dungeon-blues, heroics, Karazhan range (where characters are most often not fully raidbuffed): Those changes come as a package deal.<br>
<br>
As an example, if Blizzard really wanted the FAP weapons to provide druids with as much benefit, in terms of actual damage output, from their weapon as other dps classes, they would not have merely increased the scaling multiplier by 28.2% to match the white dps scaling on 2H weapons (which fits the words, but not the spirit of damage scaling), but by something in the range of 200%+.<br>
<br>
EDIT: Don't get me wrong - I'm quite happy with the changes overall, especially as I had more or less given up on future itemization catering to the primary stats that we druids love and adore, it is just that I do not see them provide much more than that: convenience and a larger selection of items to be considered attractive.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_511744"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I'm sorry to disappoint you, but the Idol of Terror is yet another failure of druid dps relic itemization. There is simple no way of it being better than everbloom idol in a raiding situation. The nature of the proc makes a really good proc bad as it doesn't play good with the cycle. When it procs, it will proc of the mangle, meaning that rip and mangle won't get the benefit (and those two make up about 27% of our damage).<br>
<br>
I'm going to use a 12s Cycle for this example - it's as good as it gets for the Idol of Terror, any other scenario will make it even worse.<br>
<br>
Everbloom Idol effectively adds 39 Weapondamage to your shred attacks. 39 Weapondamage equals 546 attackpower, 496.4 if you count in the new HotW. Shred will do at least 30% of your damage (usually more like 35%). So that would be 148.9 attackpower overall.<br>
<br>
Idol of Terror has a 85% procchance to give you 65 agility for 10s. You will only do autoattacks and shreds in that window. Shred damage was 30% and i assume 42% damage done via autoattack, however, only 10 of 12 autoattacks will benefit from a proc. So 65% of your damage effectively benefits from a proc and it's 85% procrate.<br>
<br>
That leaves you with 0.65* 0.85* 65 = 35.9 agility.<br>
<br>
And i don't need to show you that 148.9 ap is superior to 35.9 agility, do i ?<br>
<br>
I know this is a simplified calculation but if i put both idols into my complex dps calculator, using endgame gear, i get 1657.64 dps for the Everbloom Idol and 1653.27 for the Idol of Terror (would have to be 42.7 agility or more to be better).<br>
<br>
On the other hand, you don't lose the Idol of Terror Buff if you unequip it (i finally got on the test server), so swapping idols may not be off the table yet (i will do a seperate calc later on).<br>
<br>
It's obviously not bad for solo farming and tanking either.<br>
<br>
With tanking you will have a very high uptime and 65 agility is nothing to laugh at (~5% dodge and ~3% crit) so i'm looking forward to finally giving my Idol of Brutality a rest.<br>
<br>
Edit: It didn't occur to me that in a 12s cycle you could actually mangle before the rip thus making the idol worthwhile. In a normal situation you have to live with 14-15s cycles though and it's as the above scenario describes.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>No I think Slouken's statement is saying that ANY shifting is acceptable, that the designers have said that you pay for the shift in mana and loss of Rage/Energy. I believe that once they fix this you will be able to instantly shift from Cat to Bear, etc, with any non-GCD abilities or items used before/after/between the shift.<br>
<br>
[e] And in fact if you look at Sloukens post above that one, the guy he is quoting said that on test he can use this macro to insta shift from bear to cat, cat to travel, etc. The only limitation right now is from bear to bear and cat to cat, which is likely a bug as slouken said.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>It behaves very strange, a macro with cancelform-bear form-cancelform-cat form will always instant shift into the other form, so either cat-bear or bear-cat.<br>
<br>
Regarding Idol of Terror and tanking: Assuming you Mangle once every 6.5 seconds (due to lag) and you've got a 82% hit rate with Mangle (parry, miss, dodge) you've got an uptime of about 70% (factoring in 10s cd). That's an average of 51.6 agility, factoring in BoK and SotF.<br>
<br>
This is our first and only Idol that actually benefits our survivability in bearform. It's an average of 3.51% dodge 2.06% crit. It may be a slight loss of TPS in a rage-cap situation but it's well worth it imo.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Hmm you mean a macro that looks like<br>
<br>
/cancelform<br>
/cast Dire Bear Form<br>
/cancelform<br>
/cast Cat Form<br>
<br>
If this is the case, then figuring out whats being tripped is easier. <br>
<br>
If you use the above macro in dire bear form you get the following to happen:<br>
<br>
1. Your stance is set to [nostance]<br>
2. /cast Dire Bear Form checks your stance and sees [nostance], then checks your aura and sees Dire Bear Aura so it attempts to switch you Caster stance.<br>
3. Your stance is set to [nostance] (redundant)<br>
4. /cast Cat Form checks your stance and sees [nostance], then checks your aura and sees Dire Bear Aura (!=Cat Form Aura) so it switches you to Cat Form.<br>
<br>
Seems kinda uselessly complicated but thats the only reason why same form shifting wouldnt work, different form shifting DOES work and direct form shifting doesnt work.<br>
<br>
edit: actually if my logic is correct the macro:<br>
<br>
/cancelform<br>
/cast Dire Bear Form<br>
/cast Cat Form<br>
<br>
should work just as well as the one mentioned above. Can anyone check this?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_512407"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Incredible.  So, is anyone planning on stacking avoidance and then using either armor potions, or the resilience potion and running non-crit immune?<br>
<br>
I think the resilience would be more risky since there would be a slight gap, but the chances of taking a crit at that time would be low, and it isn't certain death (although it could be likely death).  I'd probably go with a +armor potion of the two, though.<br>
<br>
And of course most people will use it for exactly that which has already been mentioned; health stones/pots.<br>

Drums are now castable in animal forms!  It says in the patch notes they are instant, but what it didn't say was that I can just pop it in cat or bear for a free mini-heroism at no mana or cast time cost.  I'm so glad I leveled my last 10 points on Drums of Battle now, I've got a ton banked on an alt.  I don't have CoT exalted so I can't test the Drums of Panic but if they work too... Bearform Int.

As for choice of potion, obviously Ironshields are an option for tanking, but we can also consider Haste potions for burst threat.

<br>
The way I'd do it is: find a bunch of low level mobs with super fast attack speed. Drop armor by enough so that there's a significant difference between the average hit you take in caster vs what you take in Bear Form. Start /combatlog and round up 10-15 of these mobs in Bear Form (face your back to them so you don't dodge most of their attacks). Hit the /cancelform healhstone/potion Bear Form macro. Run away and deaggro.<br>
<br>
Examine log file. Things to look for:<br>
See if there are any lines of you taking a hit in the combat log between "Dire Bear Form fades from you." and "You gain Dire Bear Form.". If there are, there's a chance it might happen while tanking a raid boss.<br>
<br>
If there aren't, closely look at each and every hit around the time you hit the macro. Check to see if any of them are higher than what he should be hitting you for in Bear Form. This is to make sure combat logging imperfections due to latency or whathaveyou don't taint the results. If there are no higher than normal-for-Bear-Form hits in there, we're gold.<br>

The new glove bonus is the most interesting part. It's kind of odd that they continue to itemize directly for crit strike on feral gear, but overall it seems decently designed. It also shows that armor penetration is for everybody, I suppose... certainly the hot new stat that is going everywhere, in 2.3.</div>

A 2cp Maim lasts 3 seconds, so unless you're regularly in the habit of using 1cp Maims, this really doesn't do much. Unless .. if you interrupt a Mage's Frost spell, then he won't be able to Iceblock for 3 seconds while Maimed? Can't think of anywhere else this might be useful.<br>

Or could it have PvE implications, like we can't interrupt Aran, Julianne, Caribdis with normal Maim since they are immune to stuns and incapacitate .. would this glove bonus turn Maim into our "Kick"? If so, that makes it a lot more interesting.<br>
<br>
Cuer I'm guessing the presence of crit rating on the set is just to get a better spread of stats to minimize "stat stacking penalties" from an item budget point of view. It sure is far better than S1 and S2 though, of course.<br>
<br>
edit: To clarify, since they have removed +healing, utilizing the freed up item budget on stacking even more Str/Agi/Sta etc would result in a very slight increase in those stats, so instead they replaced it entirely with crit rating so it doesn't suffer from the stat stacking effect. Also a good amount of hit rating!</div>

And it's not terribly odd to have crit strike rating on gear.  If you look at Malazaar's calculations, crit rating is approximately equal to AP and now STR (just a little worse).  And it can't be capped, so I look for it sooner than I look for hit rating on an item.</div>

</div>Look at it from more than just a 1v1 perspective, though (it is an <i>arena</i> bonus, afterall). Ferals typically find themselves teamed up with a second DPS in 2's and 3's and two or three DPS in 5's. If you have more than one person on a single target, the gouge effect doesn't do much because your partner(s) is still going to be hitting that target. Maim was good to use as an interupt when you're burning someone down, but now it'll be 3 seconds better. <br>
<br>
Seems pretty good to me, especially since it's just a glove bonus.</div>

I think we might have found the best end-game tanking bracers, these are quite amazing.</div>

</div><br>
I'm not a fan of these to be honest. Currently I use the <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32814"><span><span class="purplename">[Veteran's Leather Bracers]</span></span></a> for tanking with a 10 resilience gem. Switching out to the bands would cause me to lose a hefty amount of resilience that I'd be forced to pick up elsewhere.<br>
<br>
But compare them to the new <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33881"><span><span class="purplename">[Vindicator's Dragonhide Bracers]</span></span></a> (at time of writing they aren't in the item linking database so stats below).<br>
<br>
236 Armour<br>
+22 Strength<br>
+22 Agility<br>
+29 Stamina<br>
Red Socket<br>
Socket Bonus: +2 Resilience Rating<br>
Classes: Rogue, Druid<br>
Requires Level 70<br>
Equip: Improves critical strike rating by 21.<br>
Equip: Improves your resilience rating by 17.<br>
<br>
No wasted heal on these this time (from a tanking perspective) which makes them much more intersting. But they have +1 str, same agility, -2 stamina and -81 armour. In addition it has the critical strike rating (meh) and the Resilience rating. The 10 intellect isn't worth mentioning on an tanking item, not like you'll be powershifting. I think after that there are very few situations where you'd use the heroic badge over the S3 honour epic. The only situation I can think of is if you desperately needed more armour but I've already got way too much armour, certainly don't need more. <br>
<br>
Interestingly enough its turning out that the "Vindicator's" honour epic 3 piece set seems perfectly itemised for tanking, much better than any of the new items for those slots. <br>
<br>
Comparing the boots (<a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33880"><span><span class="purplename">[Vindicator's Dragonhide Boots]</span></span></a> to <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32593"><span><span class="purplename">[Treads of the Den Mother]</span></span></a><br>
<br>
Den Mother has:<br>
+159 armour<br>
+8 Strength<br>
+3 Agility<br>
+5 Stamina<br>
-6 Intellect<br>
-21 Crit rating<br>
-26 Reslience<br>
<br>
The only stat I'd really be worried about losing would possibly the armour. The 8 strength is eclipsed by the pvp boots crit. The dodge is so tiny not worth mentioning, same with the 5 stamina. In return you get a lot of resilience and, more importanly, the possibility to drop an item elsewhere with defense on it in place of an alternative. So questionably an upgrade to BT trash drops and much much easier to get for most people. Trounces Zierhut's and Boots of Natural Grace in my opinion (though some may prefer the hit on the latter).<br>
<br>
<br>
The belt is probably the worst piece (<a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33879"><span><span class="purplename">[Vindicator's Dragonhide Belt]</span></span></a>), I think unless you need resilience the 2 gems on <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30042"><span><span class="purplename">[Belt of Natural Power]</span></span></a> leave that as the superior piece.<br>
<br>
<br>
As for the arena gloves discussion I agree it is quite odd and very situational. I suppose its mainly to give us some utility in locking out pallys from shielding but the timing has to be good and if hes that low I'd be wondering why he wouldn't shield straight off instead of risking a heal. I guess they wanted it on a combo point ability to prevent spam and maim has a longish cooldown.<br>
<br>
<br>
I think overall I'm not greatly impressed. As has been mentioned a few times in this thread it seems the itemisation team did these items months ago (reasonable I think) way before they knew of the HotW change coming. Its ironic that we finally get many items with +strength on just as it becomes even less useful than agility for us.</div>

</div>I agree. I'm sure if you ask pretty much any feral with 2.1k+ rating in 2s or 3s whether they value +healing on a pvp set they'd all say yes. The fact that the vast majority spec NI supports this. Overall I'd use this set for 5s (if I even played feral in 5s) but for 2s and 3s I'd be reluctant to give up the +healing from s2 set.<br>
<br>
The change has probably come about from the vast number of 1200 rated mangle-spamming ferals clamoring on wow forums that they "no wan heal" in pvp. /sigh</div>

</div>Nop. Healing on our PvP sets just SUCKS, except for 2v2 and even there you can just get 2 pieces of resto season 3 and still heal your ass off..... or just put healing gems into s3 feral who cares how your doing it. Sockets are there for a reason!<br>
I am NEVER (SMALL exceptions where +200 heal would NOT help) healing in 3v3 yet we managed to get 2300 in season1 but we dont play that often now..<br>
<br>
The new set is awesome, you can reach the hit cap easily and have like 8% more crit AND armor penetration... AND that glove bonus that is finally usefull to some extent<br>
Stop complaining!</div>

Yer as said they are tagged onto the sides of the pictures of the S3 arena sets on mmo champ. <br>
<br>
I checked out the rogue versions too as I currently prefer them for tanking but the S3 rogue versions aren't great compared to the feral ones. Not that I'll be needing them now, speccing Resto when 2.3 hits! </div>

		<div id="post_message_513606">Some quick calculations using Tossk's calculator and a base of 4500 AP, 45% crit and non-maxed hit rating (so I can see the value of hit gear) gives some of the following:<br>
<br>
1. New pvp feral bracers are better than anything besides Insidious Bands<br>
2. The S3 gladiator's helm blows every helm out of the water except for Cursed Vision of Sargeras<br>
3. The S3 gladiator's chest is significantly better than everything besides the Nether Shadow Tunic which it is only 5 AP behind. <br>
<br>
Now for full T6 geared people this probably doesnt make much of a difference in terms of top gear lits. However if you're in SSC/TK there is EASILY obtainable gear now that will put you near top BT/MH gear. A quick list off the top of my head for SSC/TK druid DPS would look like:<br>
<br>
Head: S3 Gladiator<br>
Neck: Choker of Vile Intent<br>
Shoulders: Malorne<br>
Back: Razor Scale Battle Cloak (or Drape of the Dark Reavers)<br>
Chest: S3 Gladiator<br>
Wrist: S3 (equiv) PvP Feral Bracers<br>
Hands: Malorne <br>
Belt: Belt of Deep Shadow or ideally Belt of One-Hundred Death's (ZA belt is closer to the same value here as is the new badge belt)<br>
Legs: Skulker's Greaves  <br>
Boots: Nyn'Jah's Tabi Boots<br>
Ring 1: Ring of Lethality<br>
Ring 2: Garona's Signet Ring (the timed ZA ring is better than both of these but may be tough to get)<br>
Trinket 1: DST <br>
Trinket 2: ZA trinket off Zul'jin (bloodlust brooch and crystalforged are also good here)<br>
Weapon: S3 Staff (S2 Staff if you cant get the appropriate rating)<br>
<br>
The difference between this gear set and the top gear set is pretty small (probably less than 200 AP equiv). Looking at the gearlist you need to hit 25 man raids for only 3 slots (one of which is from Gruul). <br>
<br>
Note:<br>
The Difference between the T4 Helm and S3 Gladiator helm is 78.83 AP equiv and the difference between the T4 Chest and S3 Gladiator chest is 81.01 AP equiv. The shoulders are only ~50 AP better than the S3 gladiator ones and the T4 gloves are only ~50 AP better than the Gloves of Dexterous Manipulation, so clearly the T4 shoulders and gloves should be used. I think most people didnt realize just how small the difference between the T4 gloves and the top end gloves were. Its MUCH better to use the Malorne gloves and shoulders instead of giving up one of the sweet other slots like chest or helm. Maybe I calculated something wrong but it sure looks that way to me.</div>

		<div id="post_message_513659">I know this isn't really the place for whining horribly, but I think it's a bit crap that the s3 helm is better than everything for DPS other than the cursed vision. I know that the PvP gear shouldn't be heavily behind the equivalent PvE gear (in this case Tier 6) but to actually be ahead of it in a pure DPS perspective is a bit... weird.<br>
<br>
Then again, to use that stuff you have to give up set bonuses. The fact T4 is so good for set bonuses right now is what screws all this up, as using 3 pieces of s3 with 2 pieces of t4 is probably one of the best combo's available to most people.<br>
<br>
There also need to be more trinkets. The 9 (or however many) I listed on the main page, plus the new one from ZA isn't enough! More trinkets!</div>

</div>Where did you get the info that S3 will be the last season till WotLK? There's still at least a year till the next expansion, and a 12+ month S3 would be pointless.<br>

As far as the S3 feral set goes for PvE tanking, I was sad to see that only the head/shoulders would be upgrades from T4. With a 2k personal rating on the shoulders, the S3 hat is the first piece to shoot for towards a PvE tanking set.</div>

</div>I noticed the same thing at first glance, running the numbers<br>
<br>
Druid bracers: ilvl 141 (not including extra armor because I dont know what the armor value is by default)<br>
Rogue bracers ilvl 124 (again not including the armor, but they have LESS extra armor anwyays...)<br>
<br>
Whats the ilvl of that gear supposed to be? Somewhere around 130-135 no? I think it means the druid ones are WAY overbudget, unfortunately.<br>

</div>As I posted above, the S3 set is fantastic for DPS too especially if you're not raiding BT/Hyjal. Also can anyone check my numbers on the whole Malorne gauntlet thing for Endgame dps?

		<div id="post_message_514097">I'm personally not going to whine until the patch is released. And I strongly believe they should re-itemize T6, as I'm shortly going to explain. <br>
 <br>
Simply: the age of the hit-immune bear tank is really, really possible. And they can't allow us to continue going in that direction; they can't create another level in Sunwell. <br>
 <br>
If you've ever played with Rawr (linked up in the first posts) you know it's a very good tool for evaluating data. In addition, with the advent of our first mitigation idols in the game, we have an on-proc 5% dodge idol. <br>
 <br>
I went and tried to maximize dodge in Rawr. I optimized every piece of gear for the most AGI/Defense/Dodge possible. I got to 100% dodge+miss WITHOUT using trinkets, against normal mobs, with a hunter scorpid sting and a single Insect Swarm, with all the AGI consumables, etc. HP and Armor were fairly low, but that's not the point-- he was hit immune. Ask me if you want a copy of the XML or a gear list-- but essentially, high AGI gear with the most sockets, crimson spinels in each socket. <br>
 <br>
There have been a few discussions on "is it possible to get hit immune", and now the answer is a "yes, if you plan for it." I won't bother going into what a hit-immune tank means; however, I can only assume that Blizzard would think it's a Bad Thing. <br>
 <br>
So they purposely have to restrict the AGI on our items. They can't afford to put it on weapons because we could swap in a 50 AGI weapon and have every T5 druid be within trinket range of hit immunity. They can't just switch the STR and AGI on T6 because we'd all be at 80% dodge, standard. <br>
 <br>
If they can't let us easily become hit immune, they'll need to either: <br>
- rework dodge ratings/etc to have diminishing returns (which would probably also encourage similar reworkings for parry, block, miss, etc, which may have an impact on the entire hit table, which they probably won't do)<br>
- re-itemize to prevent us from getting more dodge on any item we already have. <br>
 <br>
In my 100% dodge set, I'm using 3 pieces of T6. I would be very surprised if they didn't reduce the AGI in at least the head/shoulders/chest in return for different DPS stats, much like S3 gear.</div>

1) 2.4 defense rating = 1 defense skill (at level 70) - <i>Incorrect</i><br>
<br>
This number shows up a lot, probably because it was stated by a blue.  And it is very close to the correct number.  However, if you stack defense rating, you'll find that it's simply incorrect.  The actual value is 1.5*82/52 (1.5 is the level 60 conversion, and 82/52 is the scaling for level 70 ratings), or about 2.3653846153 - which looks a lot like 2.4 if you round it.   To test this, I put on 363 defense rating - 151.25 using 2.4, 153.463 using 1.5*82/52.  The character sheet read 153.<br>
<br>
2) The character sheet rounds the displayed defense skill - <i>Incorrect</i><br>
<br>
Actually, it truncates the value, just as it does for weapon skill.   This is also easy to test - 359 defense rating gives 151.772 defense skill, which displays at 151.<br>
<br>
Thus, the correct value for uncrittable defense rating is <b>154</b>.  There is no difference between 154 and 156 defense rating - both give 65 defense skill.<br>
<br>
Now, I know people have been critted with 154 defense rating.  They've also been critted with 156 or more.  To date, I have seen no one offer a reason why this happens other than player error (sitting) or game bugs (some equipment not giving defense rating, talents not being properly applied).  I see no reason to distinguish the 154-155 crits from the 156+ ones.<br>
<br>
This isn't to say there isn't a mechanic that takes higher defense levels into account, simply that I have seen no evidence of one, nor have I seen any one offer evidence for one.</div>

		<div id="post_message_514228">Aggro holding with 65% crit shouldn't present much of a problem. You won't put out 2000 tps, but neither does a prot warrior. You should avoid Maul and just Mangle + Swipe. Your autoattack and primal fury procs will provide the rage for it. Given your high crit, 800 tps should be possible at least. I got as high as 1000 tps sometimes when offtanking voidreaver (and that with "only" 45% crit).<br>
<br>
It's a serious dilemma with us tanking druids. They can't give us more armor, cause we scratch the cap since T4, they can't give us more dodge as we would easily become melee immune. So how are they gonna improve our tankability ? More HP ? More Aggro ?<br>
<br>
I think the easiest solution would be to remove the armor cap, as it is stupid anyway. So our T7 would have more armor and less dodge (i prefer more mitigation over high dodge anyway).</div>

</div>Did you include SotF and 4% dodge from talents? It might let you make some other choices that would increase your health pool to a slightly more acceptable value. Would be fun to solo tank Hydross. Your lowered threat output wouldn't matter since everyone is killing adds anyway from transitions due to the secondary abilities killing the raid at 500%.<br>
<br>
Something I've been throwing around in my spare time is that druid tanks pretty much only scale with stamina at this point, and have for a reasonable while. Armor is capped and beyond a certain point dodge hurts your tanking by preventing enough rage generation to spam maul + mangle/lacerate/swipe every global. This doesn't even consider more dodge leads to a higher likelihood of dry streaks. So now druids have to choose between defense or maintaining threat which isn't a choice any tank should have to make as gear gets upgraded.<br>
<br>
Anyone else think that Feral Instinct should have weapon expertise added to it similarly to the warrior/pally tanking talents. It would also serve a double duty as the warrior/rogue dps talents. This isn't a hey they are getting something shiny complaint, but more of parry strings can kill druids just as well as warriors especially if every hasted attack is a crush. It's a nice threat boost for warrior tanks but giving the same to pally tanks leads me to believe it's more of an anti-parry ability than threat based.</div>

		<div id="post_message_514424">Rawr implies SotF and dodge from talents.  You can make different gear choices to improve the other stats-- it was more a proof of concept.  You can buy more dodge with druid Dungeon 3 sets, more insect swarm, shadowy embrace, and so on... If you wanted to, you could craft a Stormherald as it has more AGI. <br>
<br>
In the "if I were designing the game" department, I'd put some sort of diminishing returns on dodge, change the armor cap so that you're capped at 75% <i>or your armor mitigation vs an even level mob, whichever is higher</i> for lower level cheese protection, nerf the dodge rating druids get from AGI, and instead give a reasonable amount of armor (i.e., armor which scales as levels do) per point.</div>

On a serious note I hope blizzard does offer some alternate form of progression for bear tanking. Raising the armor cap would alleviate some issues but an additional stat would be better. Reducing our dodge chance and giving us block, without a shield block type ability, would actually help quite a bit as well as improve existing stats for us. Would make strength give some form of tanking benefit beyond threat and add tank item synergy with warriors/pallies. Parry would just be another form of dodge and isn't needed.</div>

<br>
I think SBlock crush immunity and Defensive Stance (and the associated imp talent, i.e. magic damage) is now mainly how we're lagging behind. Another major factor is encounter design and both are slightly related. Add in a dash of itemization disparity (specifically the lack of crafted resist gear for Frost and Nature) and you get the current situation.<br>
<br>
I don't have any BT/Hyjal experience, but from what I understand of all the SSC/TK level encounters you can safely have a Druid "MT" everything aside from the Kael'thas fight (the encounter necessitates the user of the legendary shield I believe?).<br>
<br>
Maulgar / Gruul - trivial for an appropriately geared Druid.<br>
<br>
Magtheridon - as above.<br>
<br>
Hydross - you can build a crit immune 295 resist set using crafted jewellery and AH greens. What hurts here is the 16% extra damage you take, and the fact that to meet crit immunity and the resist requirement, you take a hit in threat generation due to the amount of slots you have to swap. Whereas, a Warrior swaps in much fewer slots due to the excellent crafted resist gear. But it's still not impossible for us.<br>
<br>
Lurker - melee mob, fairly trivial.<br>
<br>
Leotheras - melee mob, perhaps somewhat Druid friendly (?) because of our snap aggro after WW, we can contribute dps in Cat Form on Demon phase, arguably kill our inner Demon easier (if the Warrior messes up Spell Reflect).<br>
<br>
Karathress - 16% extra damage from the random magical effects, but otherwise nothing special. Tidalvess favors a Druid.<br>
<br>
Morogrim - arguably one that favors a Druid early in progression levels (Earthquake eats SBlock charges I believe?) but the gap closes as Warriors start to get closer and closer to passive crush immunity.<br>
<br>
Vashj - my guild has only spent half a night attempting her, but so far (phase 2, two pylons down) I can't see any major disadvantage to having a Druid. And if your Paladins mess up the BoF rotation, or if you don't have enough of them to maintain 100% uptime, we can break the root easily while she's running out of range to shoot and not risk taking casterform hits (even less so in 2.3 with the /cancelform instashifts).<br>
<br>
Al'ar - melt armor technically affects us worse that it does Warriors, but we can favor a higher dodge set for this fight.<br>
<br>
Void Reaver - Druids shine here anyway due to our superb OT threat. Mitigation wise it's trivial for both.<br>
<br>
Solarian - we can sort of stay ahead of dps going all out (at the start, gets harder over time) using well timed taunt &gt; rage dumps but that's neither here nor there (only for her sporadic melee hits, I understand Arcane Missiles are random). Both of us are similarly effective in helping corral adds for aoe. Warriors might have a slight advantage with being able to Shield Bash Priest heals?<br>
<br>
Kael'thas - tough luck Druids =(<br>
<br>
Anyway, point being, if you're running a Druid MT for whatever reason, you won't be significantly hampered until you get to Kael, and then maybe in BT/Hyjal when Warrior's passive mitigation (armor + SBlock use) pushes them further ahead. By how far? I'm not quite sure, I guess I'll know when I get there. BT/Hyjal also have a few encounters which make it impossible for Druids to tank them? Correct me if I'm wrong on these.<br>
<br>
With the 2.3 Fear Ward changes, Archimonde is one that'll require either a 6 Priest rotation + PvP trinket failsafe, or a stance dancing Warrior.<br>
<br>
And apparently Illidan has a Shear ability that needs well timed SBlock to survive?<br>
<br>
Are there any other encounters in BT/Hyjal that make it impossible for a Druid to MT successfully?<br>
<br>
~Anyway. Moving forward from this, what's the solution? We've been at or near the armor cap since mid-T4 level, our dodge can also reach fairly high values where we're at the stage we need to consider dropping avoidance to get a reasonable rage influx (arguably not as badly as Warriors, since we generate significantly more from dmg + Primal Fury). Packing on the Stamina just seems unnecessary.<br>
<br>
Secondly, how do we close the gap that SBlock and Defensive Stance create?<br>
<br>
To begin with, we need itemization parity. If we can have crafted FR gear, why not NR and FrR leather? They had both at level 60 for AQ40 and Naxx, though of course those were aimed at Rogues. If any encounters require tanks to wear resist gear, options need to exist at the plate and leather level, without fail.<br>
<br>
SBlock. Great mechanic to add some skill to tanking, and very effective mitigation. We do need some kind of protection again crushings, or at least chain crushings. If not on gear, maybe via talents or something. I'd love to see something like "After being victim to a crushing blow, the Druid enters a state of heightened reflexes, making the next x strikes against him unable to crush."<br>
<br>
Defensive Stance in light of magic damage. This one we can probably leave alone.<br>
<br>
I remember reading something at the Blizzcon where they said they weren't quite happy with the randomness of crushing blows, and plan to alter the mechanic drastically (probably in WotlK?). So I'd be very interested to see what they have in mind.<br>
<br>

		<div id="post_message_514686">Actually I'm a bit confused here.  Some warriors were discussing 100% avoidance in one of the other threads on here, I think they decided it was only situationally useful.  They at least theorycrafted a set, but that I think relied on parry which isn't always applicable.<br>
<br>
If using parry, then itemising defense and dodge rating in equal combinations will only get you to 100% avoidance a little bit slower than druids and agility (mainly due to kings).  Of course we have an advantage because socketing doesn't suffer from the 1.5 power thing that base stats do, but warriors often have more sockets to play with than we do.<br>
<br>
I can see them dropping agi back so that it gives the same dodge as dodge rating.  Then you could look at actually buffing the amount of agility on our gear if we end up with lower avoidance than warriors (quite likely).  <br>
<br>
Our mitigation situation is in a very bad way.   We're capped at a very reachable 75% where as warriors and paladins have both overall damage reduction (talent for pally and defensive stance for warrior) and block that allows them to get much more effective mitigation.   One option would be to change thick hide, so that instead of increasing your armour it instead provided some other form of damage reduction.</div>

				<b><u>Powershifting</u></b><br>
Many people ask what powershifting is. The basics: Furor gives the player 40 energy when they switch out of form and back in. This means you can shift out and in for a net gain of 40 energy, every time. This is essentially a conversion of Mana to Energy, as it will always cost you mana to shift. By timing the shift you can make it so you lose as little energy as possible (from the residual energy in your bar when you shift and the energy you lose while out of form), and this is essentially the skill of Powershifting. By doing it correctly you should be able to gain about 30-35 energy, and even doing it badly the gains should be in the region of 20 energy or so, although it is possible to gain no energy or even lose energy if you do it badly.

	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>Isn't this pre-2.2 patch? I didn't test it with timestamps but it seemed like the energy counter now resets every time you shift back into cat. I.e., I can no longer shred-powershift right after an energy tick and still get the next tick's worth of energy as soon as the first 2-sec tick interval is over. In which case the most that Furor can add to your net gain is 20 energy, since you would have gained 20 energy in that same time interval anyway had you not powershifted.<br>
<br>
I hope I'm wrong.</div>

</div>Basically the energy counter is now a fixed ticking counter rather than a new one created when you shift into cat form. <br>
<br>
Furor will now give you a % of the energy based on how long is left in the current tick timer. So if you switch to cat with 1 second left on the timer, you get 20 energy at the first tick instead of 40. It made power shifting less effective but overall its still worth it if you can time it well.<br>

As most of us I'm pretty disappointed by <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33465"><span><span class="purplename">[Primal Man-catcher]</span></span></a> and its stat assignment. I can't see really whether it is an upgrade from <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28658"><span><span class="purplename">[Terestian's Stranglestaff]</span></span></a> I'm currently wearing or not. Assuming you are hit capped i suppose the ignore armor plus the added AP are worth more than the agility on the Stranglestaff.<br>
Being a casual raider compared to most of the posters on this board and no big PvPer I consider <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33716"><span><span class="purplename">[Vengeful Gladiator's Staff]</span></span></a> out of my range but i will see once S3 hit the table.<br>
The <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32014"><span><span class="purplename">[Merciless Gladiator's Maul]</span></span></a> would be the "last" alternative but i would think that i will be better using my "rare" arena points for some random S3 armor which doesn't require a personal rating. As these pieces are really great for my point of progression (2/4 TK..) for both tanking and dps.<br>
So what are you guys using for dps or what would you use at that point of progression?<br>
<br>
I'm not happy with it but i think i have to live with the fact that you have to be "good" at PvP to fill your PvE role as good as possible as a druid </div>

</div>I think this is a very nice list and I totally agree.<br>
How about making this complete for all bosses?<br>
<br>
Therefore I would like to add some bosses known to me.<br>
<br>
Hyjal:<br>
<br>
- Rage Winterchill can be tanked by a Druid.<br>
- Anetheron can be tanked by a Druid.<br>
- Kaz'rogal favors a Druid, because he has a warstomp and during that stun the only mitigation will happen through armor.<br>
- Azgalor can be done by Druid, but I think he slightly favors a Warrior.<br>
- Archimonde has already been discussed.<br>
<br>
Black Temple:<br>
<br>
- Naj'entus - no big deal to any tank.<br>
- Supremus - no big deal to any tank.<br>
- Shade of Akama - here you just tank adds, defenders slightly favour a druid.<br>
<br>
I don't know about much about the other bosses there yet, we had a test fight with Teron Gorefiend and it seemed that a Druid could do him.</div>

- Shahraz: Advantages either way (less magic damage or more armour). Can't crush.<br>
- Council: Multi-tank fight. Favours warrior on priest/paladin because of reflect/(easier) interrupt.<br>
- Illidan: Shear requires shield block. P2: Easier to get crit immunity in fire res as a druid, and generally higher health pool.</div>

Murwen: I'm not sure really. P3 is generally no problem for us agro wise with a warrior tank, and never has been. I suppose it depends on your tank - we have someone who knows what they're doing with agro as they're always pushed to the limit to do as much as possible. Also, having a prot warrior DPSing in p3 is generally worse than having a feral DPSing.

</div>Damage wise p3 souls is definetely better for warriors but aggro wise, I'm not sure. Dont know if our tanks (and druid tanks) suck but in general on reliquary the dps is always just behind the MT and could easily get over. From this point of view (and especially in p3 where every second matters) it sounds better to have a druid tank to squeeze out maximum potential dps rather than 1.5k less dmg on MT every few seconds.<br>
<br>
As for Teron, hes definetely doable as well and actually its even not that bad with the crushings (he got quite slow attack speed and massive hit potential, so armor works awesome there). Aggro wise it was about 300-500 tps difference, which can count aswell.</div>

It depends on whether you need the damage or not. If you have a lot of people doing sub-par DPS then you need your "main" DPS'ers to pull out as much as possible (i.e. you need amazing threat generation). We're also lucky in that even our worst DPS'ers do good DPS.<br>

</div>I'd like to point out that during stun a Warrior looses 3 abilities (Block, Parry, Evade) and is left with pure armor mitigation (+ less damage from Defensive Stance). Same thing for Druids, but they only loose Evade. In addition to that, we can easily have 20% stun resist (15% from Talent and 5% from Metagem). I think it comes down to, how much the Warrior or Druid can mitigate while stunned  to evaluate who should tank that Boss (I believe T6-Warriors are able to Mitigate more than 75% of damage even while stunned)<br>
<br>
Archimonde does not crush.<br>
<br>
Morogrim Tidewalker favors a Druid especially if you have the choice between a T4-Warrior and a T4-Druid, later on the Warrior becomes more and more viable.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Basically the energy counter is now a fixed ticking counter rather than a new one created when you shift into cat form. <br>
<br>
Furor will now give you a % of the energy based on how long is left in the current tick timer. So if you switch to cat with 1 second left on the timer, you get 20 energy at the first tick instead of 40. It made power shifting less effective but overall its still worth it if you can time it well.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>If we're talking about efficiency the most you should be able to get is 20 energy back. When powershifting you're clearly going to want to shift at lowest energy possible which means you will have just attacked. Even with the insta-shifting on the PTR there's still the 1 sec GCD to deal with before you can shift back in. That means at least 1 second will be wasted when powershifting meaning a net gain of 20 Energy. With the one button shifting it should be quite easy to actually do this though, so its not that big a deal. 3 shifts per minute at this rate is already the same energy generation as the 2T4 bonus which is quite important dps wise and still a good boost to dps.<br>
<br>
My fixed spirit regen is something like 114 MP5 while not casting so that returns 1368 mana per minute. Combined with raid buffs and pots/dark runes (if needed), not to mention your initial mana pool, it should be possible to shift much more than 3 times per minute, especially for short fights. With the instant changes its going to pretty much be a button you press to gain you 20 energy. Thats pretty good in my opinion.</div>

I believe it's the second one. As long as Form changes work like Stance changes for warriors (pretty sure they do), where the stance cooldown is independant of the GCD.</div>

</div>I have no idea. If you have 24 other people willing to test it, go ahead and try it. I'm not entirely sure about the whole mechanic, but I assume it's avoidable by all main avoidance methods (miss/block/parry/dodge), and I'm pretty sure Shear shows up as being blocked, so I'm not sure the absorb from PW:S would work. It also requires the assigned priest to be good at what they're doing and make sure they stay in range at all times.<br>
<br>
I'm glad about furor being instant too. Are you sure Cat Form(Shapeshift) is the correct name for the ability? I've always seen it as Cat Form or Cat Form().<br>
<br>
Edit: Giving a quick scan of Shear on WoWhead and Thottbot, it seems everyone there believes that it's blockable only (although there is a comment saying it can be parried). If that is the case, then druid's definitely can't tank it. I've only ever heard about it being purely blockable.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Shear - cast time of 1s? maybe 1.5 ~ Reduces targets health by 60%, only avoidable if blocked.  I guess you could think of it as an "100%-crush" type move and the debuff is applied if you recieve a crushing blow.<br>
<br>
EDIT: pw:s the answer is simple --&gt; Does absorbing damage stop a hit from being a crushing blow? <br>

</div>The thing about the tanking pot macro people really need to watch out for is the GCD. Very often you're spamming abilities.

</div>I'm a bit surprised no one has commented on this yet...<br>
I've tanked Kael through a couple rounds of pyros before I even got any T6 loot.  His pyro's are on a 1m cooldown, barkskin is on a 1m cooldown, you do the math.  Warriors reduce 15.5% of magic damage, while barkskin reduces 20%.  Add that to the fact that druids have way more HP and it's almost preferred that they tank Kael.  If you lack the dps to interrupt the second pyro, it's certainly not difficult to get healed to full in 4s before the second one, which is what we did.  It's really easy to land two big heals in a 4s window as a paladin.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_516158"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I'd never really thought of it that way before. However, why take any damage when you can just avoid the whole lot with a single click?<br>
<br>
Also, having a feral tank and a prot warrior DPS seems a bit of a strange way around in my mind (we only ever had one tank during p4/5 - a hunter kited the Phoenixes). Feral's just excel at fights where you can both DPS and tank at different stages, and Kael is one of those fights.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_516273"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Yep being able to tank and dps in one fight is our biggest boon to any raid, but there aren't that many fights where it's truely that useful.   With 2.3 our dps gear will be worse for tanking, and the reverse, which I think is good to some extent.  I'd far prefer for our dps to be competitive with other hybrids when we're in dps gear, and then drop 20% or so when we're in full tanking gear instead.<br>
<br>
I took another look over that 100% avoidance thread and did some gear searches myself.  It looks like rogues can reach the mark with a few % to spare, and druids can either get very close or just make it, of course you need some pretty crazy raid buffs to do that.  2.3 will change that a bit but I can only think of a few pieces with more agilty on them. Warriors and paladins can only really get to 85-90%.<br>
<br>
Correct me if I'm wrong, but damage taken is max(K *  (1-R) * (1-M) - B, 0) where K is the unmitigated damage, R is the damage reduction factor, M is the mitigation factor,  B is the block style reduction.  K depends on the damage roll and attack table result, as does B (if you can block).  As we all know you can't reach 100% mitigation, but it's capped at .75 anyway, and you can't change R with gear and it is usually &lt;= 0.1.  (Warrior in def stance has R=0.1, paladin has R=.06, we have R=0).  <br>
<br>
The unmitigated damage can be up to twice the base damage (crit) or can be 0 (dodge, miss etc), so if we look at the average damage over time we get Kav=(1-A)*Dav where A is an avoidance factor, which isn't capped in anyway, and D is average damage<br>
Let's assume the boss can't crit, crush or be blocked. Then A is pretty much the avoidance we were talking about before.  A=100% and you take no damage, ever, which is cool, but a design problem :P<br>
<br>
The solution is probably to cap avoidance in some way.  To do so is probably a good thing, because like resistance, the more avoidance you get the more value additional avoidance has.   Going from 98% to 99% is just as costly as going from 1% to 2%, but has much more practical value.  If they do cap avoidance, then they should remove the physical mitigation cap, because it doesn't suffer from the same scaling issue.<br>
<br>
One way to cap avoidance against boss mobs at least, would be to move crushing blows to the top of the attack table.  It would also nerf shield block for stopping crushes.  Alternatively you could give mobs a new attack, called penetrating blows that hit normally and penetrate through any avoidance (ie have the highest priority).<br>
<br>
I might be incorrect about the block modifier, does anyone know if it applies before damage reduction? A stance switching warrior should be able to determine that.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

By default any spell that requires you to leave your current form will automatically cancel your form before casting. This applies to shadowform and stealth as well. You can disable this with /console autoUnshift 0<br>

negating dodge and parry in catform wont realy help much since you should be attacking from behind the target, thus making the stat only work for doges since mobs can't parry from behind.<br>
Am i missing something here? The stat is prolly one of the best tanking stats, but for a druid in catform it seems to me like any other stat would be better almost <!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div><br>
you cant compare it directly to hit rating though? <br>
you need 142 hitrating to remove all chance of  ever "miss" wheras expertise rating never negates the chance to "miss", only "dodge" and "parry", which in turn only affects "dodge" since you should be attacking from behind the mob...<br>
<br>

		<div id="post_message_517830"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->It all comes down to itemization. It's not too difficult to get the necessary hit rating to remove misses off the table, even for the majority of druids at level 70 who are in Karazhan / tier 4 gear. Now Expertise gives a clear stat to remove dodges off the table as well; even for the odd feral druid who only ever does cat DPS, that's still worthwhile.<br>
<br>
As the numbers keep increasing for hit rating and such on gear, it becomes increasingly easy to reach the hit cap; if they put in more gear with Expertise, that can be fit into outfits as well. Of course this is all reset with the next expansion, with higher levels and new numbers that have to be reached.

</div>So, quick review of the combat table. <br>
<br>
Misses, dodges, and parries are all separate events. To eliminate "misses", you get hit rating.  Expertise does nothing to mitigate misses.  You "miss" 9% of the time against a boss, and thus you need 142 hit rating to reach that 9%. <br>
<br>
However, even if you mitigate the misses, you still get dodged.  the current theory on the amount dodged by a boss is somewhere between 4 and 8 percent (I haven't kept up with the exact number, but the last one I heard was 5.5%).  You would need 5.5/.25, or 22 expertise, which is 22 * 4 = 88 expertise rating to reach 5.5%.  <b>This is completely separate from misses and Hit Rating.</b><br>
 <br>
However, a miss and a dodge are effectively the same: each is a non-hit, with the same energy penalty for not hitting the target, and are thus often categorized the same in things like Recount.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Lots of classes have useless talents in their trees, feral Druids aren't exactly alone there. Not sure what you're talking about for Expertise, a quick search at Wowhead reveals only 2 possible (blue) weapons with Expertise a Warrior/Shaman would even consider using for DPS. Also Warriors/Shaman prefer AP/crit over +hit anyway, so I'm not sure what the point is, aside from bitching about Druid itemization (which you're entitled to, but comparing talents/spells/items in a vacuum is a pretty pointless exercise.)<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_518229"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Let's take a look into the history of Expertise:<br>
<br>
At First we had the oldstyle weapon skill rating til 2.0. Back then the Weapon skill was exactly the oposite of Defense 0.4% per point anti dodge, anti miss, anti block, anti parry and your chance to critical hit.<br>
<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080416093151/http://www.wowwiki.com/Formulas:Weapon_Skill" target="_blank">Weapon skill - WoWWiki, the Warcraft wiki</a><br>
<br>
In TBC this was changed to the non-linear effect as discussed in this Forum here. With the different Formulars. <br>
<br>
Now this Weapon skill is changed to Expertise and not limited to one type of Weapon any more. I guess it could really be more a Tank skill given you don't attack from the front.<br>
<br>
On the misses not mitigated by Expertise, I think we might need to look at the 9% in more detail. With what we new from before. At the very first the Theory was that Bosses had 5%+0,2 per lvl in total 5,6% Further down the history of theorycraft we discovered it was more than 5,6% and ended up with 8,6-9%. The most recent tests say 9%. When we discovered the Weapon skill effect reducing it by 3% with 20 points FCSR. So going back to expertise, it might be the same as before with slight changes or better a combination of the old pre-2.0 weapon skill and the TBC weapon skill with slighly different numbers. <br>
<br>
This needs to be tested on the test realms or we need to wait for the release of 2.3. I know that this is more a brainstorming what could be the new case right now and I should have come up with at least a small test. But good testing against a 3 point higher Mob will be limited on the test realms. There might be someone who could have better options to test it than myself.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Yes and no. Hit rating does suck for shamans, but only because you already get 9% hit from talents. If you didn't have that hit rating would be important UNTIL you reach the 9% hit. All he is try to saying that in terms of lowering Miss chance (actual miss, dodge or parry) feral druids have none whereas all other melee classes get one or more options. However i do agree with you that it is pointless to draw a one on one comparison of talents.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_519596"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->They have implemented the /cancelform changes in the new PTW patch. So far I can use this macro while in bear form:<br>
<br>
/cancelform<br>
/cast [nostance] Dire Bear Form<br>
<br>
and it will instantly shift me out and back into bear form.<br>
<br>
Now a small problem I have is that I used this macro to change back to caster form, but now it changes me straight back to bear form :P<br>
<br>
So I think I might just have a generic "/cancelform" macro and hotkey that to return to caster form.<br>
<br>
<br>
Anyway, I'll go test the instant potting now and update this post.<br>
<br>
UPDATE 1: Using the potion macro from bear form does work now (Start in bear form, click the macro, +heal happens, and I appear back in bear form). I'll try out that autoUnshift stuff now.<br>
<br>
UPDATE 2: With my 2p T5 bonus and autoUnshift, I can press Regrowth in bear form and here is the order I saw it happen before the world server died:<br>
<br>
1. Press Regrowth<br>
2. I appear to cast the regrowth in bear form (the bear swung his paw like with FF)<br>
3. I then appeared in caster form right after the regrowth went off.<br>
<br>
UPDATE 3: Actually the regrowth just happens instantly. Also, the pot macro from bear form worked with autoUnshift off. I think I might go try some power shifting :P<br>
<br>
UPDATE 4: autoUnshift doesn't work for potions, and there were some interesting results with power shifting:<br>
<br>
<b>Shift 1</b> (From Caster to Cat form, the rest are Cat to Cat using the macro at the bottom of my post)<br>
10/20 15:25:48.390  You gain Cat Form.<br>
10/20 15:25:48.406  You gain Leader of the Pack.<br>
10/20 15:25:48.406  You gain Track Humanoids.<br>
10/20 15:25:48.421  You gain 40 Energy from Furor.<br>
<br>
<b>Shift 2</b><br>
10/20 15:25:52.890  You gain 40 Energy from Furor.<br>
<br>
<b>Shift 3</b><br>
10/20 15:25:57.468  Track Humanoids fades from you.<br>
10/20 15:25:57.703  You gain 40 Energy from Furor.<br>
10/20 15:25:58.140  You gain Track Humanoids.<br>
<br>
<b>Shift 4</b> (I may have messed this one up. I was having some trouble since I couldn't use my macro while the GCD was up. It would just leave me in caster form. So it might have happened here, I can't remember)<br>
10/20 15:26:02.812  Cat Form fades from you.<br>
10/20 15:26:02.828  Leader of the Pack fades from you.<br>
10/20 15:26:02.828  Track Humanoids fades from you.<br>
10/20 15:26:03.062  You gain Cat Form.<br>
10/20 15:26:03.062  You gain Leader of the Pack.<br>
10/20 15:26:03.062  You gain Track Humanoids.<br>
10/20 15:26:03.390  You gain 40 Energy from Furor.<br>
<br>
<b>Shift 5</b><br>
10/20 15:26:08.109  You gain 40 Energy from Furor.<br>
<br>
<b>Shift 6</b><br>
10/20 15:26:12.421  Track Humanoids fades from you.<br>
10/20 15:26:12.656  You gain 40 Energy from Furor.<br>
10/20 15:26:13.031  You gain Track Humanoids.<br>
<br>
<b>Shift 7</b><br>
10/20 15:26:16.546  Track Humanoids fades from you.<br>
10/20 15:26:16.781  You gain Track Humanoids.<br>
10/20 15:26:17.140  You gain 40 Energy from Furor.<br>
<br>
- I wasn't trying to optimize my shifting times (someone else can do that now :P), I was just looking at how it worked.<br>
<br>
- This was used with a similar macro to my bear one:<br>
/cancelform<br>
/cast [nostance] Cat Form<br>
<br>
- I live in Australia, so I think the variance in the combat log for each shift is due to latency (I usually have about 450ms).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Powershifting is absolutely amazing in response time, I am really looking forward to utilizing this more, now just to get a working druidbar.<br>

It's pretty much equal - if you're already hit capped then the Primal is going to be better by a decent margin. Obviously neither is as good as the vengeful gladiator (over 100 APE ahead), but it won't be that easy to get 1850 rating quickly in some battlegroups. Still a shame that it has such a ridiculous amount of stamina though :&lt;<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Unless something has changed, the cost to add 1 point of agility is exactly the same as it is to add one point of strength, one critical strike rating, one dodge rating, etc.<br>
<br>
That's what always made something like Wildfury Greatstaff a bit mindboggling.<br>
<br>
Right now, it could be 500 armor, 54 agility (instead of 54 dodge rating), and 75 stamina without changing the item level.  More dodge, more crit, AP in cat form, and agility scales with kings and SotF would make this weapon a lot better.<br>
<br>
The argument for agility is that any item that has X strength or Y critical strike rating could have that particular stat replaced with X agility or Y agility, maintain the exact same item level, and be better for a Druid.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

So in 15 seconds you get 150 energy gain, plus ~19(0.04x20) for about 165 energy per cycle.  That's enough for 1 rip and slightly more than 3 shreds.  OOC means about 45% of the time you will get 4 shreds in.  55% of the time you would need 2 crits out of 3 for 5 CP, and 45% of the time you would need 1 out of 4 to crit.  Or in other words, you need ~%47.6 crit.

				<div style="font-style:italic">Unless something has changed, the cost to add 1 point of agility is exactly the same as it is to add one point of strength, one critical strike rating, one dodge rating, etc.<br>

That's what always made something like Wildfury Greatstaff a bit mindboggling.<br>
<br>
Right now, it could be 500 armor, 54 agility (instead of 54 dodge rating), and 75 stamina without changing the item level.  More dodge, more crit, AP in cat form, and agility scales with kings and SotF would make this weapon a lot better.<br>
<br>
The argument for agility is that any item that has X strength or Y critical strike rating could have that particular stat replaced with X agility or Y agility, maintain the exact same item level, and be better for a Druid.</div>

I'd quite like something similar with the pillar and substitute the strength for dodge rating or expertise.

		<div id="post_message_520496"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->There are a couple of reasons why Pillar of Ferocity is bad. It also leads in to why our PVE weapons are inferior to our PVP ones for DPS.<br>
<br>
The reason that is most obvious to people is the lack of focused stats (tank or dps). Tank stats are Armor, Stamina, Agility (or the inferior Dodge), Expertise, Defense and Resilience. DPS stats are Agility (or the inferior Crit), Hit, Expertise, Strength and Armor Penetration. Feral Attack Power is the defining characteristic of a feral weapon, so that's always on there regardless. PoF has 2 tank stats and 1 dps stat (and a poor one at that), making it a "hybrid" item.<br>
<br>
What makes it worse is that it is one of the few Epic feral weapons with less than 5 mods (including FAP).<br>
<br>
Vengeful Gladiator's Staff: 3 DPS, 2 PVP Tank, FAP.<br>
Pillar of Ferocity: 1 DPS, 2 Tank, FAP.<br>
Merciless Gladiator's Maul: 3 DPS, 2 PVP Tank, FAP.<br>
Wildfury Greatstaff: 3 Tank, FAP.<br>
Primal Mancatcher: 2 DPS, 1 Tank, FAP.<br>
Gladiator's Maul: 3 DPS, 2 PVP Tank, FAP.<br>
Terestian's Stranglestaff: 3 DPS, 1 Tank, FAP.<br>
Feral Staff of Lashing: 2 DPS, 2 Tank, FAP.<br>
Staff of Natural Fury: 1 DPS, 2 Tank, 1 cheaper shifting, FAP.<br>
Earthwarden: 4 Tank, FAP.<br>
<br>
If you look at that list, the best tanking weapons have the most number of tanking stats (3-4). Equally, the best DPS weapons have the most number of DPS stats (2-3).<br>
<br>
Ideally, Tanking weapons should have 4 tanking mods on them (out of Armor, Agility, Stamina, Expertise and Defense) and FAP. Ideally, DPS weapons should have 3 or 4 DPS mods on them (out of Agility, Hit, Expertise, Strength and Armor Penetration), some stamina (although not as much as a tanking weapon would have) and FAP. If Blizzard would actually do that for our PVE weapons, we wouldn't have anywhere near as much to complain about.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Yah 1850 rating is no easy task unless you already have a steady group that can reach it now.  The high amount of stamina does hurt that item budget, but that does somewhat help the item be useful in bear form as well.<br>
<br>
<br>
WRT to the high number of 2H and two end-boss bows, not other do Arms and Ret Pallies like 2Hers, your Holy Pallies (maybe Shaman too, since they get 2H skill for free soon) would not mind having a 130+ dps weapon for when they have to farm and level to 80.<br>
<br>
One of the bows is only a hunter weapon (but the best), but the other one can be used by Rogues and Warriors.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Well, the wording of primal tenacity is that it "increases your chance ... by 15%", so whatever your base chance is would be included.  I always thought there was a 5% chance to resist most even-level spells, although I haven't done actual testing on this (has anyone else?).  That would make it 20%.  Predatory Instincts is a chance to avoid aoe effects; so it's less clear if this  stacks directly with the (hopefully) 20% resistance.  But avoiding and resisting a fear both show as resist so I would assume they are the same effect.  As such I've always been optimistic that we had a 35% chance to resist level 70 aoe fears.  <br>
<br>
Can anyone suggest a good place to get aoe feared often, without taking excessive damage?  I'd like to test this, but I don't have any pocket healers, so my options are limited.

</div>According to the consensus for this thread, 2t4 is better than 4t6, by a margin of less than 1%. So unless you gemmed differently on your T6, you should not be seeing a noticable dps loss</div>

		<div id="post_message_521009">As has been stated in many other threads about DPS and gear, your playing style and things like if you didn't have CoR up during a fight and other environmental factors are likely to cause more variation in DPS than something a simple as a set bonus. <br>
<br>
In most modelled settings (i.e. no lag, no human error, etc) with 2t4 and 4t6, 2t4 wins out over the 4t6 bonus. Taking into account lag, human error, screwing up powershifting so you lose a tick of the bonus, and other things like that, there will invariably be some loss in the 2t4 bonus, while the 4t6 bonus will suffer virtually no loss because of all these factors. It's entirely plausible that you're playing in a low lag environment without using powershifting (or just being very good at powershifting and not wasting procs) and so 2t4 would come out better for you.<br>
<br>
As david said, you really shouldn't be seeing a noticeable difference between the two overall (unless you put pure stamina in t6 and pure agility in t4).<br>
<br>
Putting in these stats to Toskks:<br>

</div>There's a pretty significant difference between the bonuses. Again though, this is assuming no lag, no human error, and other such "perfect" circumstances. Any boss where you aren't always attacking (something like Council, Kazrogal (stun), Azgalor (RoF), Winterchill (D'n'D), Archimonde) will also give more value to 4t6 because rip will account for more of your damage than other attacks, in general.<br>

				An important note about Omen of Clarity and the 2-piece Malorne bonus: Unfortunately, the only mechanic available for coding energy gain (without a complete rewrite of the model using a recursive loop) does build in error. In the model, after the total cycle time is calculated, the cycle time is reduced by the chances of these two procs happening during that time. Technically, this time reduction would mean that some of those procs didn't actually happen, thus slightly overvaluing those two mechanics

</div>I know this is a bit late, but it should be noted that there's been findings indicating that something as simple as Faerie Fire can provide an additional ~4% DPS increase when stacked with 5 Sunders, plus allowing that much more threat to be generated. The GCD for a FF is a minuscule investment compared to the overall benefit you gain from the armor penetration.<br>
<br>
In this same vein, I do think the Armor Penetration stats on the S3 and various new pieces of armor and weapons in 2.3 is a good evolution, better than Haste, for stat progression. I'm certainly anxious to see how the Sunwell loot turns out.</div>

Might be misinterpreting this but potentially this is a substantial buff to druid tanking in fear based encounters?

<br>
how does this one work does it average out to x procs per minite useing just weapon speed?<br>
Does it average out useing weapon speed with the inclusion of extra attacks from specials?<br>
Basicly how do you calculate it.<br>
<br>
Thanks for any feedback in advance</div>

<br>
The testing on the PTR looks like 500 threat + weapon damage for a 5 stack. At a spammable move for 9 rage we can compare that to lacerate which gives ~300 threat, including the damage. That's a pretty hefty deficit to make up solely from autoattack and mangle. Warriors also tank with a faster weapon than the slow 2.5 speed bear attack which equates to more HS spam and quite a bit of threat. <br>
<br>
Some basic napkin math in an infinite rage situation looks like warrior and druid threat will be pretty close if all the new warrior changes go through.</div>

		<div id="post_message_523271">The big problem is that AP doesn't have much effect on lacerate threat, especially against bleed immune mobs. The obvious solution to that would be to change the threat scaling on the initial damage to 4/5 and drop the bonus threat.  Yeah blocks would be an issue but they don't happen enough for it to be too much of an issue.<br>
<br>
Our threat scales pretty well in spite of our tanking moves, and the extra FAP and expertise change should help a bit, although it's hard to find expertise on feral pieces.  (Pray for a gem I guess).  <br>

</div>Never concerns me when someone gets a buff to their PvE performance =). The main reason to bring ferals is that we are so flexible in a raid, being able to DPS, tank and heal if needed. <br>
<br>
I think feral druid TPS when not directly tanking the mob (VR, Gruul, Supremus) will still be better than warrior TPS. If we are all actually tanking, then why would it concern me if they get a buff? It just means maybe they can DPS his target first, and more safely than they could before. <br>
<br>
Ferals will still be needed, have no fear. A bigger issue is that they still did not fix the Pillar of Ferocity! However with the ZA staff changes, I think it must only be a matter of time.<br>
<br>
Also, with this instant shift &gt; use a pot &gt; instant shift back. I see from combat logs there is a 0.03-ish second time period where the druid is out of form. I know it is not significant, but what is to stop the druid simply being 1 hitted in this short time span? I guess it makes pots a "well, If I don't pot I am dead, if I do pot there is a 1% chance I am dead... may as well pot!" sort of decision? Due to having the 2T5 bonus in my tank set, I could see myself shifting for an instant regrowth fairly often, so assuming its not in actual fact all "instant" this is a concern for me.</div>

		<div id="post_message_523678">As I've posted before, the GCD is going to really catch a lot of people, even with the new shifting change, especially if they used to play or ever played warriors. If you need a pot RIGHT NOW, you cant just click your macro if you're spamming abilities. While it doesnt activate the GCD getting back into form DOES. Maybe others dont tank the way I do but Im generally spamming buttons to build up threat fastest. If I need an emergency pot its highly likely I'll need to wait at least 1 second before my GCD is up and I can use it safely. The change is definitely a good one, but its still quite different than using pots in forms.</div>

</div>There is a post in the test realms but a more active one is in the warrior forums:<br>
<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080314183903/http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=2512084203&amp;sid=1" target="_blank">WoW Forums -&gt; Satrina's 2.3 Devastate Testing (19 Oct)</a><br>
<br>
I'm quite comfortable as the preferred choice in the offtank slot but I would also like some viability as the maintank. Right now that choice is generally a druid gives higher threat but takes more damage and has no built in emergency buttons (FR doesn't quite cut it.) For some fights where you really need to burn the target down quickly then the druid is the better choice. As the threat gap shrinks the choice becomes more and more muddled and druids have the potential to be relegated to gimmick fights only and that is what I would not like to see happen. <br>
<br>
I'm not looking to be the end all choice in the MT slot, but I feel for some fights druids should be a better choice (likewise paladins and warriors are better for others to promote a healthy tanking balance.)<br>
<br>
Edit: Spelling before people notice!</div>

</div>My error....I should have quoted <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080314183903/http://elitistjerks.com/521044-post381.html" target="_blank">post #381</a> which (along with a feral dps spreadsheet) and subsequent discussion in these pages was my 'inspiration' to try the 'sharpening stones' on a staff.<br>
<br>
When I armory the poster in post #381 I see a staff equipped.  He, as well as others certainly seem to 'imply' the sharpening stones work.  <br>
<br>
Now I understand he may have equipped the stone on a dagger just to check the proc in forms, but subsequent posts (#'s 382, 383, and 384 in this thread)  seem to indicate equipping sharpening or weightstones is 'ok' on staves. I'm wondering how they managed it.</div>

		<div id="post_message_524297">Hey guys. I was just puttin around trying to figure out my "final" end game stamina value and came across something kind of strange...<br>
<br>
18 stamina, atleast for night elves, is not being multiplied by bear / dire bear form! I haven't ever seen this posted anywhere before, and I apologize if it's been discussed in the past.<br>
<br>
I was looking at my stamina. <br>
<br>
<br>
"813 stamina<br>
Increases health by 7950"<br>
<br>
I was confused, shouldn't 813 stamina increase my health by 8130? <br>
<br>
I checked around, and we found out, essentially, that 18 stamina (the base, level 1 stamina) is not counted by that. Makes sense, because 7950 + 180 = 8130<br>
<br>
84 base stam x 1.25 (bear) x 1.2 (heart of the wild) = 126 stam, but the character pane lists  105 base stam in bear form.<br>
<br>
HOWEVER.. When I would shift into bear form, the deficit was still 180 health!<br>
<br>
When really it should be multiplying the 18 stam, to 27 stam in bear form.. so 270 health should be the deficit?<br>
<br>
Meaning, that 18 stam that exists in your character screen, is NOT being multiplied by Bear Form and Heart of the Wild... making us miss out on 90 health!<br>
<br>
While not exactly game breaking, still, 90 health is 90 health! <br>
<br>
Thoughts? Is my math fuzzy? I've done calculations and gotten both ways...but then again I was always bad at math, anyone got the definitive answer?</div>

18 stamina, atleast for night elves, is not being multiplied by bear / dire bear form! I haven't ever seen this posted anywhere before, and I apologize if it's been discussed in the past.<br>
<br>
I was looking at my stamina. <br>
<br>
<br>
"813 stamina<br>
Increases health by 7950"<br>
<br>
I was confused, shouldn't 813 stamina increase my health by 8130? <br>
<br>
I checked around, and we found out, essentially, that 18 stamina (the base, level 1 stamina) is not counted by that. Makes sense, because 7950 + 180 = 8130<br>
<br>
84 base stam x 1.25 (bear) x 1.2 (heart of the wild) = 126 stam, but the character pane lists  105 base stam in bear form.<br>
<br>
HOWEVER.. When I would shift into bear form, the deficit was still 180 health!<br>
<br>
When really it should be multiplying the 18 stam, to 27 stam in bear form.. so 270 health should be the deficit?<br>
<br>
Meaning, that 18 stam that exists in your character screen, is NOT being multiplied by Bear Form and Heart of the Wild... making us miss out on 90 health!<br>
<br>
While not exactly game breaking, still, 90 health is 90 health! <br>
<br>
Thoughts? Is my math fuzzy? I've done calculations and gotten both ways...but then again I was always bad at math, anyone got the definitive answer?</div>

</div>I can recall being on the test server a few days ago and looking at AP in caster and cat gained from strength and finding some odd results of like 10 base strength not being calculated for AP. Possibly something to do with our "base" stats not being being added into the default HP and AP values.</div>

</div>Indeed. However it will make warriors daze immune, druids would need an ungodly amount of defense to reach daze immunity because SotF doesn't count towards it. So for ferals it's still "daze reduction" in all likelihood.</div>

</div>Haha. Blizzard needs to lay off the drugs. I find it amusing how they restrict some random issues from coming along with the patch notes. Some while ago they were bragging about improving the graphics of Warlocks' Ritual of Souls, which I hardly noticed any change of - and when they actually greatly improved the graphics of Cyclone it was as if they were shouting amongst themselves: "-Oh noes! We changed the graphics of Cyclone! We must NOT tell!".</div>

<br>
Here's my current UI setup with all of the macros, check out the action bar setup. It really helps having a small action in the middle of my screen, which i use for trinkets, dispel curse or potions, it makes things much quicker. Also, bongos gives you option to cast a spell on yourself with right click, which is pretty handy. I also use debuff filter, it shows timer on mangle, bash, cyclone, rip. It's a must have mod to keep track of rip or mangle, check the UI screen i posted, you can see the timer mod next to the unit frame.</div>

</div>I loved it when that came up, warrior came out in droves about how tanking while being dazed would create some unplayable universe where tanks would be unable to do anything. They quickly reverted their daze change and warriors continued to be immune, meanwhile druids have been tanking with daze for as lon as we have been tanking. Where is our free daze immunity?<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Haha. Blizzard needs to lay off the drugs. I find it amusing how they restrict some random issues from coming along with the patch notes. Some while ago they were bragging about improving the graphics of Warlocks' Ritual of Souls, which I hardly noticed any change of - and when they actually greatly improved the graphics of Cyclone it was as if they were shouting amongst themselves: "-Oh noes! We changed the graphics of Cyclone! We must NOT tell!".</div>

</div>Improvement to cyclone ?!?!?!<br>
<br>
That new graphic has been the single largest cause of people in my raids dying since 2.2 came out. Every time I try to click on some ghoul running off after a Warlock or Mage in hyjal, I end up selecting some god damn enhancement shaman or rogue with that fucking cyclone around them. It happens at least twice a boss clear and is outright ridiculous that I cannot select mobs through the damned graphic.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Is there a way for a macro to remember what form you are in and then to shift you back to that form after drinking a HS/pot?  I don't want to have 3 different versions (cat, bear, travel) of the same macro when I've already run out of space for macros.  </div>

</div>Wow, you must really like macro's!<br>
I have a few but on the whole I don't find I need any due to the way I setup my key bindings, I use all of the extra buttons on my mouse.<br>
I can shift forms and use my most common attacks without losing any mobility, by that I mean none of my shifting or spam attack buttons are pressed by my movement pressing fingers.<br>
I expect I will make one for using pots and health stones in forms though.<br>
<br>
In the thread on the Blizzard forums asking about why it wasn't returning you to the form you were in one of the druids providing feedback said they were working on a mod to do just what you are asking, sorry I don't have a link but it's linked a couple of pages back in this thread.<br>

</div>Yeah kinda, but to turn it away from that whines. Feral druids would be better choices for FR tanks for Illidan because we can do somewhat less terribly on damage afterwards, but I can recall times where we wiped because of a daze on a cross over or during an eyebeam. Is it perhaps a tanking necessity as claimed, or just another limitation to live with? Does anyone else in here tank the Flames of Azzinoth and has daze affected their tanking on that encounter? <br>
<br>

Macro space is gonna hurt next patch, I can think of at least a half dozen new macros to include on my already cramped keyboard. Can't say I am disappointed though, ++potting, improved powershifting, healthstoning, improved drumming, etc.</div>

</div>You got dazed ~2 seconds after the flame spawned in that video, fyi <br>

I have my own issues when tanking the flames, but daze hasn't been one of them. Walking backwards or strafing prevents that for the most part and you should pretty much always be in a position where you don't need to move too far/quickly.</div>

</div>Hmm it seems you have a different path than I run, which is probably to be expected. But for that video alone, a daze during that last 5% when the eye beam snuck up on you there would have easily caused a wipe(similar circumstances to what I have experienced in the past but during a pickup and reposition after the other tank died, should be a wipe in its own right but yeah). Also you do risk a daze every time you run through the flame, low chance as you turn quick enough, but a chance none the less.<br>
<br>
My path basically runs around the arc once, similar to your first pass, then I cross over quickly and restart the same path. This is meant to keep the melee on the Flame virtually 100% of the time, save an unfriendly eyebeam path.<br>
<br>
PS - thanks for that video btw, I thought they broke Improved Camera like a year ago, found the new version on Curse.<br>
<br>
--<br>
<br>
Foofer, you guys seem to run a reasonably high rogue damage on the flames, what is your path and are you the primary tank or the second one?</div>

<br>
The whole ensemble brings you to around 280ish FR while leaving enough room to still get crit immune. Reaching cap FR isn't quite as important really as staying crit immune, so your gear choices should reflect that, it's fairly easy to hit the 250+ FR mark without dropping any crit immunity, pushing beyond that typically takes some luck in getting the items to stay crit immune.<br>
<br>
I've recently picked up a couple of things on the cheap and so I could probably alter my gear list a bit to be able to pick up more FR from the <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=31074"><span><span class="bluename">[Amulet of the Torn-heart]</span></span></a> while staying crit immune.</div>

In regards to Beam dodging, I'm fairly sure I strafe jumped there-- which will always avoid being dazed.<br>

In regards to Blood legion I'm going to go out on a limb and say alot of the Insane rogue dps comes from when their Dual legendaries are actually beating on Illidan --- Worst case you could set up paths so that win tank #1 is tanking beyond a line of fire tank #2 is inside his first trail allowing melee to swap<br>

</div>For me, it's mostly just the stam. The more hp I have the more buffer I've got for those moments where you are either stuck in a blaze (really bad beams can cause this sometimes) for a few seconds longer then you'd like. With gemming, <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=29499"><span><span class="bluename">[Blastguard Boots]</span></span></a> can be 57 stam and <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=29498"><span><span class="bluename">[Blastguard Pants]</span></span></a> can be 75 stam. My gear list leaves me not very far from being capped and with either an Ironskin Elixir or even possible a Fort flask with newer gear I can put in the Torn-heart amulet and be FR capped while crit capped. Maybe even without them actually.<br>
<br>
I cannot for the life of me remember why I felt the need to put a voidsphere in the pants though &gt;.&gt;<br>

I'm at work currently so I'll have to check when I get back in about an hours time or so.</div>

</div>Right, home now and looking at my gear. It's exactly as I posted. It puts me at 17035hp unbuffed with 20.45% dodge and 2.65% crit reduction at 281FR.<br>
<br>
I'm assuming you've got +15 resilience on chest which means your resilience gives you around 1.56% reduction there meaning you'd have to make up 60-64 defense rating to make up the rest of crit immunity, trinket and ring give a total of 51. So I'm assuming your head and/or shoulder is enchanted with the defense ones?<br>
<br>
I think that would make all the difference really since all my gear is enchanted with the offensive enchants where possible. If I could get hold of T6 helm I could reenchant my t5 one to be defensive stats to reach crit cap and then add in Torn-Heart to put me at 297 FR with crit immunity.<br>
<br>
Maybe I should be a bit more aggressive in my bidding for the t6 helm next time : b<br>
<br>
In response to Felorin: It was something that was considered early on when we were jsut getting there but really passing up 40stam and 12agility for 20 resistance just didn't stack up at all.</div>

296 FR, crit immunity no sockets wasted with void spheres, a decent amount of hit and ~16300 hp unbuffed (No endurance of course). This gets over 23k if I have an imp and non- improved commanding.<br>
I get to use my best piece- t6 legs and have a slight buffer whereby at full hp I can take a beam and a 75% resisted melee hit and live dependant on healing.</div>

</div>The Chromatic Wonder flask is excellent for multi-purpose feral raiding.<br>
<br>
Using some Toskk equivelancies for a raid buffed cat (say, 4500 AP and 45% crit chance) of 2.26 AP per strength and 3.00 AP per agility (assumes kings and SotF), 18 strength and 18 agility is worth about 95 AP.  Not quite a relentless assault flask, but pretty close.<br>
<br>
Defensively, 18 stam gives 306 health to a Night Elf (321 to a Tauren?).  The 18 agility with kings and SotF provides 1.39% extra dodge.  That combines into a nice tanking flask.<br>
<br>
The resistances are icing on the cake.</div>

</div>I have the exact opposite opinion. The occasional 4k crit (like once a try) isnt going to kill you. I always go for 365 FR (badge legs, gloves and boots and some more). It certainly will put less stress on your healers. At least thats my experience and I have tried with &lt;365 as well.</div>

		<div id="post_message_528376">If you aren't crit immune there's always the chance for a 25% resist lining up with the crit causing a ~17k melee hit. If that happens not to line up with a big heal, that's a world of pain.<br>
<br>
Not having crit immunity = burst (potentially semi-instagib).<br>
Not having 365 fire res = more damage over time (i.e. more healer stress)<br>
<br>
I don't see why anyone wouldn't go for both when it's perfectly possible to get both and still have reasonable other stats. I'm only crit immune with a flask on - I happened to forget 2 weeks ago and didn't get crit because it's that small a chance, however I wouldn't have intentionally done it and just because it happened once doesn't mean I won't still be taking flasks from now on. Taking unecessary risks just isn't good.</div>

I'm not sure if it's been updated recently though; I'd love to see a new version with the 2.3 stats and more gear options.<br>
<br>
On a side note, did anyone post a list of "best possible feral DPS gear" with the 2.3 changes in mind, including Arena gear? I couldn't find one.</div>

<br>
Meaning if you instead of the usual Mangle/Shred/Rip cycles only use Mangle/Rip. It would mean a 6/10*65 agi buff vs 88 damage on Shred and 280ap on a trinket slot vs for example bloodlust brooch (118ap in average).<br>
It would also mean that you virtually never miss the Mangle buff on Shreds or Rip tics or other bleeding effect raiddebuffs (like it might have happened before for the distracted druid *cough*).</div>

Add to that the massive differential between Shred and Mangle in both base and scaling damage - one getting ((x*1.6)+0.65y)*1.1*1.2 = 2.112x+0.85y  and the other getting ((x*2.25)+y)*1.1*1.3 = 3.2175x+1.43y - and it just won't work. Assuming you get 400 extra AP from the idol and the trinket, you'd gain approximately 143 total damage on rip, with the 4t6 bonus. <br>

The difference is just too much even with every bonus you can think of added (2t6, 4t6, idol of terror, ashtongue talisman are all that I can think of).</div>

</div>Completely unbuffed I just went on PTR and did a 1.9k FB against boglash (had to use claw to make sure I didn't kill him before I got 5 combo points!). Looking at char screen showed a damage range of 350-370, and my last default hit was 255 (meaning ~1/3rd damage reduction). That's around 3k non-crit (i.e. almost 7k crit!) whilst unbuffed against a zero armour target, without the 15% increase talent (but with 4t6, which is 15%) and not with a full energy bar (although it doesn't really make much difference). I should think if you specced it, raid buffed against a 0 armour target you could get almost 10k, which is freaking ridiculous and shows why they don't want to make it better. If they removed the energy-&gt;damage conversion and just let it sit at a static 35 energy, it might actually be better than rip in a few situations.<br>
<br>
Rake is the crappy dot. And yes, it sucks. Claw is the non-mangle direct attack.</div>

		<div id="post_message_530070">Not to derail the FR gear discussion, but I was hoping I could get some advice on more general choices.  I've always considered myself primarily a tank, it's what I prefer to do; but some fights in BT, like Teron gorefiend, are single tank encounters, and the warrior class lead is more or less de facto tanking it.<br>
<br>
So, my guild then realized my dps is low, and I'm finding myself on the WL far too often.  A lot of my gear is gemmed/enchanted for tanking, and I will be looking to move stamina gems to agility, but let me know if there's any other options I should consider.  Since we're working on tier 6, I don't have much of a chance to go back to tier 5 instances for farming, they're no longer on the raid schedule.  One of the upsides to this is that I'm missing the tier5 helm/gloves: so I have the 2t4 set bonus naturally.  That said, I can't swap in the tier 5 helm and put on tier 4 shoulders, if that would be a suggestion in the first place.  I could put on tier 4 shoulders, but then I'd have 3 tier 4, 2 tier 5.  This may be worth it with the shifted enchants...<br>

And in general, considering that things like leader of the pack won't show up in wow webstats, about what % of rogue's damage should I show in the logs to be successful?  The dps group is usually just a warrior or a hunter, then rogues/me.  Shamans are not common.</div>

<br>
-re-gem the helm<br>
-use the Ogir'la bracers and trinket over your current selections<br>
-make Shadowprowler's if you want to keep the T5 chest for tanking<br>
-try to get enough hit through other means so you can use A'dals ring<br>
<br>
Overall though your gear is pretty solid and you should be able to do 70-75% of what your rogues are doing dps wise, sometimes better and sometimes worse.  Depends on the fight.  Therefore you might want to look at how your are spending your time dpsing.  Are you doing the standard rotation of shred to 5CP's and waiting until 75+ energy before ripping?</div>

Quite simply, it's not going to happen with the gear that's in the game right now/2.3 for ferals (or for warriors either, afaik).<br>
<br>
I am planning on putting together a tanking set that has both the new badge neck (48stam/20hit/20expertise or so) and the shapeshifters signet, as between them it gives 5% "to hit" in effect, plus the extra hit from the neck (although I'm using pendant of the titans, so I have that already). Getting crit immune is going to be interesting, although I think I've got a set sorted that'll work without having to switch helm/shoulder enchants or use 15resil/12def on chest/bracers, or using gems. It allows a bit more variety in gear anyway.</div>

		<div id="post_message_530363">The next patch will help enormously with improving your gear via rewards that can be obtained without raiding. <br>
<br>
<br>
Helm: S3. No doubt here this is superior to everything but the cursed vision from illidan<br>
Neck: Fine (original heroic badge neck is slightly better, but this is a marginal difference). <br>
Shoulders: T4<br>
Cloak: pre-BT raids there's a bunch you could use (Cloak from Kael, Aran, Morogrim etc). BT you have the Shadowmoon Destroyer's Drape which is very good. If you cant get any of those, get a Vengeance Wrap crafted. Its the best you'll get besides all the ones I just mentioned. <br>
Chest: S3. Again very very good. Aside from Nether Shadow and Midnight Chestguard you're not finding anything better than this. <br>
Bracers: Ogri'lla bracers are good for now. The druid Honor wrists post 2.3 are absurdly good (and way overbudget, I expect a nerf). The rogue ones are quite good too.<br>
Gloves: T4<br>
Belt: Deep Shadow if you're still able to get Vortexes. The heroic badge belt that is coming out is quite good too (marginal difference between it and Deep Shadow). <br>
Legs: The heroic badge ones are excellent, as are Skulker's Greaves. Only T6 and the offset T6 equiv pants are better.<br>
Boots: Heroic badge boots are the best you can get post patch besides Shadowmaster's treads.<br>
Rings: Almost all the rings require some sort of either T5 raiding or T6 raiding to get. Otherwise the two you're wearing now are actually pretty good (post 2.3 Toskk's calculator has Ravenclaw as VERY slightly better than A'dal's). <br>
Trinkets: Bloodlust Brooch and Hourglass are the two best post 2.3 that dont require any raiding to get. Crystalforged is very close. Darkmoon Card: Crusade is good, but expensive and really not that much better than any others. <br>
<br>
Note that the two ideal pieces of T4 are the Shoulders and Gloves if you dont have the T6 Pants/Gloves. If you do have T6 pants gloves, you should go Shoulders/Chest for T4.</div>

<br>
You have to consider the wider implications of what you do if you care even slightly about your guild or rate of progression. It's just like the DST - it's the best feral DPS trinket, but I wouldn't ever consider taking it over any of our rogues, warriors or enh shaman because it would get more use and be better used on any of them. It wouldn't ever go to me because of using a loot council, but even with DKP systems there needs to be some sense in it if you don't care purely about self-character progression.</div>

edit:<br>
If DST stands for dragonspine trophy, then it is different case. We do far less dmg via white attacks than the other classes you named, so it is obvious that this haste trinket does not go to a druid. Using the same logic, the belt should go to feral druids :-). We benefit from it more.</div>

		<div id="post_message_530606">Once you get past T5 content the worth of an offtank that can still generate good threat while in front of the boss diminishes greatly. Both Hyjal and BT require 1 tank for the majority of encounters, and those that require offtanks do not typically need extra threat (supremus, for example, is based entirely on health). The only real exception is Gurtogg, but even then while not MT'ing you won't be using the expertise very well. Sure, it would help a bit for trash, but do you really want to base your entire tanking setup on trash tanking in terms of future content?<br>
<br>
I agree that expertise is nice for tanking, but I would not use the belt for tanking if I had it, due to the PvP belts being vastly superior in the amount of crit immunity they give, along with more stamina (although socket dependant) and armour. Any time that I switch out any piece of gear for something that gets more threat and I die (which happens surprisingly often when I do), I always wonder if it was worth it (and invariably it isn't - 5g repairs ftl). <br>
<br>
Considering also that as long as you use tier gear in most slots, it will be quite hard to get the 9% hit cap with the change to weapon skill, the difference between the two belts is pretty small for pure DPS. This differs for other melee classes, because although they may not be at the hit cap, they will definitely be at the hit cap for specials. Due to druid's having the same cap for both, there's little difference between Expertise and Hit for pure DPS, while for other classes Expertise is a lot better pretty much all the time (mainly because talents get you very close to hit-capped with specials or fully hit capped with specials for the other classes).</div>

Primal Fury (5 rage on crit) proc'd a whole 106 times, giving me a total of 530 rage.<br>
I used in Enrage when I wasn't MT due to knockbacks for extra threat, which was an additional 86 rage.<br>
Lastly, Bloodlust (Druid T4 2 piece set bonus) proc'd 10 times, for another 100 rage.<br>
<br>
Now, I'm not sure if you even gain threat from rage generation, but if you do and our threat modifiers are applied, that would be an additional 1074 threat. While that's not a lot over the course of an 8.5 minute void reaver fight, I'm trying to be as accurate as possible.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I was wondering why <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304064906/http://www.speedyshare.com/789903347.html" target="_blank">Volden's Spreadsheet</a> isn't added to the list. It's the "best" spreadsheet I personally found, much because of it's user friendliness. I can just select gear from a dropdown menu, select buffs and it calculates my DPS, much like all the awesome rogue spreadsheets going around. Just the kind I love!<br>
<br>
I much prefer these kind of spreadsheets to the "input stats, get dps" thingies.<br>
<br>
I'm not sure if it's been updated recently though; I'd love to see a new version with the 2.3 stats and more gear options.<br>
<br>
On a side note, did anyone post a list of "best possible feral DPS gear" with the 2.3 changes in mind, including Arena gear? I couldn't find one.</div>

</div>Sorry for posting this here, but I'm not sure how to get ahold of the author of this spreadsheet.  I tried this out today and noticed that it was calculating my stat totals incorrectly.  Below are my corrections to the formulas to account for SotF not applying to base stats and always rounding down.  I have tested these changes for Night Elves only, but they should work for Tauren as well.<br>
<br>
Sheet: Gear_Buufs<br>
Cell D72  =FLOOR((SUM(D10:D67)+IF(Malorne4pc,30,0))*SOTF*HOTW,1)+D68*HOTW<br>
Cell D73  =FLOOR(SUM(E10:E66)*SOTF,1)+E68<br>
Cell D74  =FLOOR(SUM(F10:F66)*SOTF,1)+F68<br>
<br>
My health totals are still incorrect, but I haven't had time to completely diagnose that problem yet.</div>

		<div id="post_message_531702">I've seen alot of 2.3 macros on here, but I'm surprised I havn't seen the following, so I thought I'd post my current PTR macros:<br>
<br>
Basically, the idea is that currently I have three "shift" keys.<br>
B (Bear Form), C (Cat Form), and V (Travel).<br>
<br>
Now originally, I just had the following:<br>
<br>
/cancelform<br>
/cast &lt;form&gt;<br>
<br>
The problem here was that there was no good way to get back into caster form.<br>
I essentially wanted B to take me into bear form, if I was in any other form, but I wanted to exit Bear form if I was already in bear form.<br>
<br>
Here's my solutions:<br>
MACRO 3 "Cat" Ability_Druid_CatForm<br>
/cancelform [nostance:3]<br>
/cast Cat Form(Shapeshift)<br>
END<br>
<br>
MACRO 10 "B Macro" Ability_Racial_BearForm<br>
/cancelform [nostance:1]<br>
/cast Dire Bear Form(Shapeshift)<br>
END<br>
<br>
This is untested, but should work, will test and report findings:<br>
MACRO 1 "HawkCheetah" Ability_Druid_TravelForm<br>
/cancelform [stance:1/3]<br>
/cast [swimming]Aquatic Form; [nocombat,flyable]Flight Form; [noswimming]Travel Form<br>
END<br>
<br>
Any thoughts?<br>
<br>
I also had this idea, but no time to test it as of yet. I'll post my findings once the PTR is back up as it appears to be down. This also assumes you can still do script type coding in macros. (its been awhile)<br>
<br>
local nStance = GetShapeshiftForm(true);<br>
/cancelform<br>
/use Super Healing Potion<br>
CastShapeshiftForm(nStance);<br>
<br>
The idea here is that you would need only one macro to use the potion for every form.</div>

</div>It depends on if they fix furor to give the energy immediately. You can, however, feral charge-&gt;switch to cat form immediately which is somewhat useful against casters (and it looks like the cat is charging the person too :P).</div>

</div>I've noticed this for ages now. Every now and then when casting FF I'll get a free autoattack on whatever Im casting at even if its really far away. Oddly I've never had it happen in bear form though. I remember having this happen pre-BC even when I was grinding texts in silithus so its definitely not a new phenomenon. I have no real idea why it happens, though some sort of bug in the casting of FF is likely the cause, some check thinking you're in melee range or whatnot. Its the only cat form ability to be used at range so there may be a global variable for cat form somewhere that doesn't always get tripped when FF is cast making it think its a melee attack.</div>

Your next obvious melee hit will show both that attack, and the one that occurred just before your 2nd lifebloom.</div>

</div>It appears Blizzard mixed up the amounts of crit rating on the bracers. Following the itemization formulas of item points = (Sum[(stat(amount)*stat(weight)^1.5)])^(2/3) we have these results:<br>
<br>
Current Dragonhide: ~60.51 item points<br>
Current Leather: ~51.97 item points<br>
<br>
If the crit ratings were switched:<br>
New Dragonhide: ~55.7 item points<br>
New Leather: ~56.9 item points<br>
<br>
For ilvl 141 epic bracers, the item points allocated should be ~59, so the leftover difference is probably just made up by the gem slot (speculating that a red gem slot is slightly more expensive than a yellow?).<br>
<br>
This is of course all assumption, but I wouldn't be surprised if the nerf that's foreshadowed is just this crit rating switch.</div>

		<div id="post_message_533221">So far playing around with the unshift -&gt; potion &gt; bear macro has been pretty amazing.  I can't seem to get exact combat log values, because for some reason the you gain dire bear/lotp/etc buffs aren't displayed in my combat log when using /combatlog.  However, in one test I got off a bear attack, potted right after, and in the combat log there was only a difference of 0.02 seconds between when my last bear attack landed, and the time that I gained +10 rage from furor.  Considering furor tends to lag a little bit, and I probably didn't shift at the exact same time of the attack, I'd say it's just about instantaneous.  <br>
<br>
That's definitely one of the changes I'm looking forward to most, the ability to health pot/health stone is a great emergency button that druids are so desperately lacking (granted it's still nowhere near LS or SW).<br>
<br>
Likewise, kitty power shifting is pretty much instant.  I know for me that'll definitely remove some of the tedium of power shifting, because before messing up even once can be enough dps lost to completely nullify all the power shifting effort.<br>
<br>
Combine that with all the new badge toys for feral druids, as well as the S3 stuff, and 2.3 is looking pretty nice for ferals.  The only one thing that's missing and really bothering me atm is the PoF.  I finally got a wildfury to drop yesterday, so now I'm left wondering what to do with my PoF. :/</div>

</div>I just tried this spreadsheet too and have the same problem with incorrect stat calculations.  I'm not sure if some of it is because I use Openoffice instead of excel.  I also tried to apply the fixes you suggested Dyree and they helped some (I used them in cells D72, C72, and E72 though).  Openoffice doesn't seem to work with the FLOOR command so I took that portion out.<br>
<br>
There are also some errors in the item stats to look out for, Nordrassil feral kilt for example.<br>

Did you check your crit %?  The spreadsheet is calculating mine extremely low by about 12%.</div>

Days-old reply, trivial, and probably off-topic, but I thought I'd just pipe up since I'm a chronic perfectionist - His Hateful Strike works exactly like Patchwerk's - targets the highest HP of those with threat positions 2 to X within melee range (where X is either 3 or 4 in context of Supremus - I'm pretty sure it was 4 for Patchwerk)<br>
<br>
We've definitely had both offtanks slack too much on a transition back which resulted in lots of dead melee and screaming on vent. &gt;_&gt; (And I think we wiped that attempt. Don't ask)</div>

				In no particular order, the threat moves you should be using:<br>
- Mangle. You should always be using this if it is off cooldown.<br>
- Swipe. You should be using this if tanking more than 1 mob, as long as it doesn't screw up crowd control (sheep/etc).<br>
- Lacerate. This is for tanking one mob in a low damage/high armour situation (i.e. the mob has high armour or you're doing low damage to it because of lack of buffs or similar). The bleed part of lacerate is of almost no impact on threat. Lacerating just to keep up 5 stacks is not worth it.<br>
- Maul. As above, use when you have a lot of rage and don't use if you're rage starved a lot.<br>
<br>
Generally the point where swipe overtakes lacerate in terms of threat output is when it's doing ~225 damage to the target normally.

</div>If the formula I'm using is correct, lacerate is a static 210 threat, and all lacerate damage causes 80% reduced threat.  So with lacerate hitting for ~30 (probably depends on AP), that tacks an extra 6 threat to it, or 12 threat for a crit.  Lacerate also ticks for ~250 with mangle up (again, probably depends on your AP), so that's 50 threat per 3 seconds, or 25 per GCD.  So all in all, between 240 and 250 threat depending on crits.<br>
<br>
Swipe generates hate just equal to the damage.  The tricky part here is crits.  Swipe wouldn't have to equal 240-250 damage per swipe to put out more TPS, because it can crit.  If it crits for little over double threat 30% of the time (not a difficult to reach crit number for a bear in tank gear), it's essentially putting out 33% (10% predatory instincts) more dmg/threat.  So to match 240 that would put it around 180 damage hits, or 165 to match the ~220 threat from lacerate, ignoring the dot aspect (more on that in a bit).  These numbers are calculated from my damage numbers, they might vary for you.<br>
<br>
Of course, this is ignoring the possibility of applying full lacerate, then only using it often enough to keep it up there.  I know it is mentioned that lacerating just for the debuff isn't worth it, but if you're absolutely trying to max tps, from a theorycrafting point of view, it looks like it is.  <br>
<br>
This only matters when you're swiping because it's putting out more threat than lacerate, otherwise you'll keep the debuff stacked fully just tanking like normal anyway.  Lacerate is 5 ticks, 15 seconds, 250 threat in those 15 seconds.  Let's say that with lag/pre-occupation with other aspects of the fight/etc, you refresh it every 12 seconds.  That's 4 ticks, or 200 threat, for replacing one swipe with a lacerate instead.  Basically that means that one swipe has to put out 200 more threat than lacerate (completely impossible with current gear) before it is simply not worth it to trade in one swipe for one lacerate every 12 seconds.<br>
<br>
I don't know if I'm oversimplifying things here, or if I've got some calculations/formula's wrong, but looking at it like this, swipe becomes better than lacerate at much lower damage than 225 (for me it could be as low as 165, which I might even reach against void reaver), and that the lacerate debuff is worth keeping up.  It's not much extra threat, but it's more threat than simply swipe spamming.</div>

		<div id="post_message_534882">Taken from Omen's "druid.lua" which I am assumed is as close as possible to the actual threat, Lacerate has a 285 static component with a 0.2 multiplier for the damage. Assuming a lacerate hit for 30 with a crit rate of 30%, the threat generated is 285 + (0.2*30*(1+.3*2.26)) = 295 (for a bleed immune mob). Add on the bleed damage (150 per stack, or 37.5 threat per stack over 15 seconds) and you get approximately 335 threat with 0 stacks, or ~482.5 with 5 stacks. <br>
<br>
Swipe generates threat directly from damage (i.e. a swipe for 300 does 300 threat). Assuming you want to generate 335 threat average with a crit chance of 30%, you need to do (1+0.3*2.26)*x=335 or x= 335/(1+0.3*2.26) which is approximately 200 damage. <br>
<br>
For a bleed immune mob, it's 295/(1+0.3*2.26) = ~175 damage.<br>
For refreshing a 5 stack, it's ~287.5 damage.<br>
<br>
I think I originally worked it out with 25% crit chance, and approximated it to being 225 damage as an average, which looks about right from what I've just said above. As these take into account armour (lacerate is barely affected and the swipe damage is what you observe) it's quite a good approximation. For me, even with 4t6 I'm better off using lacerate on most single target trash, just because of a lack of sunders (although my crit chance is closer to 40%, so its entirely dependant on the mob or how I'm feeling - sometimes I just switch between the two for a bit of variety).</div>

</div>A fully blocked Lacerate refreshes the bleed stack.  <br>
<br>
Is the mechanic for refreshing the stack separate from the actual damage component?  More importantly, is the threat component completely independent of the damage?  If a fully blocked attack is considered to be a hit that does no damage instead of actual avoidance, it's possible that the threat is still applied.  I don't know how block works, and haven't been able to find any theorycraft along these lines, since attacks that can be completely blocked are pretty rare at end game.</div>

The answer is somewhat obvious. If a druid was daze immune there would be no penalty, in terms of damage mitigation, to running around as much as you like during a fight.<br>
<br>
If a warrior turns and runs he will not be dazed but he will lose the ability to block or parry and, therefore, take a lot more damage. Because you can dodge when a mob hits you from behind (I'm assuming we can do this? mobs certainly can) we would not have that penalty.<br>

Although, it's quite situational, and I can't think of an example right now, there are probably good reasons why you don't want players to maintain mitigation whilst running about willy nilly.<br>

That's awesome, 20% less damage once a minute for 12 secs is going to be significant. Averages out to a 4% flat damage reduction, but you can time it with a boss's special high damage skill for better effect.<br>

</div>Yeah, bear agro and talents do add to swipe threat, but those modifiers add to all threat we generate, including the static 285 that lacerate generates.  So when comparing different threat moves we have, we can simply ignore those bonusses because they'd apply to both anyway.</div>

</div>You'd think it wouldn't refresh the bleed stack, either.  Does a blocked Devastate refresh the Sunder stack?  Can a fully blocked attack proc weapon buffs like poisons or Windfury?  Far as I know it's an open question, which would have a minor impact on the Swipe threshold.  Not terribly important, but something I've been wondering about.  Can't really think of a good way to test it, though.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Taken from Omen's "druid.lua" which I am assumed is as close as possible to the actual threat, Lacerate has a 285 static component with a 0.2 multiplier for the damage. Assuming a lacerate hit for 30 with a crit rate of 30%, the threat generated is 285 + (0.2*30*(1+.3*2.26)) = 295 (for a bleed immune mob). Add on the bleed damage (150 per stack, or 37.5 threat per stack over 15 seconds) and you get approximately 335 threat with 0 stacks, or ~482.5 with 5 stacks. <br>
<br>
Swipe generates threat directly from damage (i.e. a swipe for 300 does 300 threat). Assuming you want to generate 335 threat average with a crit chance of 30%, you need to do (1+0.3*2.26)*x=335 or x= 335/(1+0.3*2.26) which is approximately 200 damage. <br>
<br>
For a bleed immune mob, it's 295/(1+0.3*2.26) = ~175 damage.<br>
For refreshing a 5 stack, it's ~287.5 damage.<br>
<br>
I think I originally worked it out with 25% crit chance, and approximated it to being 225 damage as an average, which looks about right from what I've just said above. As these take into account armour (lacerate is barely affected and the swipe damage is what you observe) it's quite a good approximation. For me, even with 4t6 I'm better off using lacerate on most single target trash, just because of a lack of sunders (although my crit chance is closer to 40%, so its entirely dependant on the mob or how I'm feeling - sometimes I just switch between the two for a bit of variety).</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>About Lacerate.  Swipe is almost always better than simply spamming Lacerate (Lacerate spam being the 295 threat)<br>
<br>
155 damage over 15 seconds per stack, stacking 5 times, effected by Mangle debuff, this works out to 201.5 per tic.  I usually attempt to refresh around 7 seconds left, between the 4th and 5th tic, this allows 2 attempts to land Lacerate in case of a dodge/parry/miss on the first cast.  So in essence I'm only getting 4 tics, you can never get all 5 without letting lacerate expire, and then you're wasting rage building it back up to 5.<br>
<br>
201.5 * 4 * .2 = 161.2 + 295 = 456.2 threat.  This works out to be equal to a 272 Swipe.<br>
<br>
I could be wrong, but I don't think we'll ever see that kind of swipe in reasonable tanking gear.</div>

It all comes down to situation eventually. Is your mob sundered / otherwise debuffed ? Do you have multiple targets ? Are you in a melee group, getting all kinds of dps buffs ? Is your tanking set a bit dps oriented ?<br>

</div>I don't think a flat 4% damage reduction if used on every cooldown is that overpowered for tanking tbh. How far ahead does Warrior mitigation pull ahead in T6 content? How much further will they get in Sunwell? Timing it well to high damage specials will only add to Druid tanking complexity, which lord knows is simple enough at the moment.</div>

		<div id="post_message_536391">Not sure how barkskin stacks with other mitigation.  If it's multiplicative it would end up being 20% damage taken instead of 25% (assuming 75% mitigation and physical damage), which isn't all that overpowered, but would be pretty strong for absorbing nasty timed attacks or spell damage.<br>
<br>
If it's additive though (which is very doubtful), it would put us at 95% mitigation against physical, which would obviously be far too powerful for a 1 minute cooldown.<br>
<br>
Either way, it would be nice to get some sort of oh shit button as druid.<br>
<br>
Btw what's wrong with druid scaling atm?  We're not very far in T6 yet, but so far I'm not seeing myself as a weaker tank than our warriors (except for said oh shit buttons).  Granted we suffer from armor capping so quickly, but our health scales very well with stamina, and our dodge scales incredibly well with agility, so the only two things we really miss is the fact we can get crushed (a gap that does become bigger as warriors can get more and more armor while we can't) and the emergency buttons (which, next patch at least we got pot/hs as an option).</div>

		<div id="post_message_536512">Morthis/Cerunas - You basically just mentioned two of the problems - lack of emergency buttons, crushings (not fun to take a lot on a boss like Teron). The other "issues" are decent itemisation - plate boots, legs, belt, gloves, bracers, shoulders (although crap), helm, along with 2 tanking weapons and 2 shields, and t6 in comparison to leather boots + t6 for tanking. Wow, amazing variety for druids. As you carry on through BT, warriors get a lot more upgrades than druids which pushes them further ahead on a pure-tank curve (and all the druid things are trash boots, which you may have loads of or may have none of, along with tier pieces which are all late in the zones). <br>
<br>
Theres also the issue of spell reflect (RoS/Council), shield block (Illidan) and zerk rage (Archimonde) which make warrior tanks effectively required for those bosses.<br>
<br>
<br>

</div>Furor is like a million times better than IMotW even if you only include its powershifting use. It only adds in like 5 to all stats which is quite minor. Losing points in shredding attacks for points in IMotW is insane. The energy savings from shredding attacks alone scales FAR more than the extra 5 Str/Agi would. <br>
<br>
Bottom line, IMotW is a flat 5 to all stats that doesn't scale. Your points in resto should be 5 furor, 5 naturalist, 1 OOC. You can add points to NS and Intensity if you need but more than that and you're losing significant important talents in the feral tree.</div>

		<div id="post_message_536800">I'm making a spreadsheet to try out different combo of attacks/finishers/etc to see how much better/worse different play styles are. One problem I ran into was lack of info on Ferocious Bite damage so I did some tests to come up with the equation myself. While the spreadsheet is still being worked on, I thought I'd share the FB findings.<br>
<br>
For the TLDR version, a 5 pt FB has its damage as follows:<br>
<br>
Top end:<br>
ApMult * AP + EnergyMult * Energy + HighDamage * 2 + Base<br>
Low end:<br>
ApMult * AP + EnergyMult * Energy + LowDamage * 2 + Base<br>
<br>
where<br>
<br>
ApMult = 0.25<br>
AP = characters displayed AP<br>
EnergyMult = 4.1 (as displayed on tooltip)<br>
Energy = Energy at the time of FB minus FB's cost of 35<br>
HighDamage/LowDamage = the high/low displayed on the tooltip for a rank 6 FB<br>
Base = -966.43 +/- .02?<br>
<br>
These numbers are then adjusted based on talents and mob mitigation as normal.<br>
<br>
<br>
For details of how I came up with this:<br>
I used the unkillable servants in blasted lands for all of my number crunching.<br>
<br>
First I needed the mobs mitigation. My character sheet displays damage as 254-277 + 7 x 110% which is 287.1 to 312.4. I observed white hits doing 217 to 236 which gave me a mitigation of ~.2443.<br>
<br>
Next I ran 3 tests and recorded 40-60 FB hits for each test.<br>
Test #1 was with 2950 AP, rake to 5 CP, wait for a full energy bar, then FB.<br>
Test #2 was with 2950 AP, rake to 5 CP, wait for a full energy bar and an OOC proc, then FB.<br>
Test #3 was with 1997 AP, rake to 5 CP, wait for a full energy bar, then FB.<br>
<br>
Test #1 had high/low of 1586 / 1640, w/o talents and mitigation: 1907 / 1973<br>
Test #2 had high/low of 1706 / 1758, w/o talents and mitigation: 2051 / 2115<br>
Test #3 had high/low of 1389 / 1441, w/o talents and mitigation: 1670 / 1734<br>
<br>
The first problem is that the tooltip says that damage is based on the static values of AP and Energy, and a variable value of the listed damage range (935 - 968) which is a range of 33. But my attacks have a range of ~66. So using a 2x multiplier with the listed damage makes this issue go away. Removing this factor results in:<br>
Test #1: 37.59 / 37.56<br>
Test #2: 181.9 / 179.6<br>
Test #3: -199.3 / -201.9<br>
With only AP and energy left to solve for.<br>
<br>
Next was to verify the 4.1 energy multiplier as listed on the tooltip. Test #1 results in 100-35=65 energy being used with the multiplier while test #2 uses all 100 energy for the multiplier since the 35 energy of the FB itself is free due to an OOC proc. Removing this results in:<br>
Test #1: -288.9 / -288.9<br>
Test #2: -288.0 / -230.4<br>
Test #3: -465.9 / -468.4<br>
<br>
Now for the AP scaling factor. Using excel's solver, I came up with ~.25 which results in:<br>
Test #1: -966.41 / -966.44<br>
Test #2: -965.58 / -967.94<br>
Test #3: -965.11 / -967.67<br>
This remaining value is the Base tacked on to the end of the equation.<br>
<br>
Based on this, test #2 should have been able to register a hit for 1759 and test #3 with a 1388 and 1442 but I ran out of people to talk to while beating on mobs and didn't record any extra data points.<br>
<br>
Afterwards, I recorded about 50 FB's of random AP and energy and everything fell within the limits of this equation.<br>
<br>
So after all that, plugging these values into my damage spreadsheet, I get that FB damage is approximately equal to shred damage when at 0 energy and gets considerably worse from there. So heres the proof that FB does in fact suck without the Feral Aggression talent, but might be useful to non ferals that don't have the shred energy savings of Shredding Attacks.<br>
<br>
As a side note, I did some quick testing with 1 and 2 CP's and it appears the equation is the same but the Base value changes. At 1 CP, it is somewhere around -870 and 2 CP is around -890.<br>
<br>
One last thought: if its possible to hit 0 AP and do a 1 CP FB with exactly 35 energy, this would result in negative damage being done by these equations. Anyone have any insight as to where I might have gone wrong?</div>

</div>That doesn't sound unreasonable to me.  Depending on your raid buffs that wouldn't be too difficult to make at all.  With 4000 AP and 0% crit chance, you'd be doing...<br>
<br>
55+4000/14 = 341 DPS (assuming you're hit capped)<br>
<br>
Throw in Naturalist, and that number shoots up to 341*110% = 375 DPS.<br>
<br>
Toss in a meager 33% crit chance, and that climbs to roughly 500 DPS.<br>
<br>
If you include a RED and Predatory Instincts, you're sitting at 533 DPS.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
With 4300 and 40% crit chance, you'd be sitting right at 600 DPS for your auto-attacks.<br>
<br>
Neither of those numbers seem unreasonably high for a fully raid buffed situation.  If your gear and buffs add up to something considerably lower than that, or my math is totally wrong, please let me know.</div>

My reference point, Toskk's calculator, puts white DPS with those stats at 1102 * 37% = 407.74 white damage.<br>
 <br>
Edit: Found the difference.  The gear I put in ended up having a much higher raid-buffed AP than I thought it reasonably could (5.5k).  I'm actually getting very similar numbers for white DPS when putting that number into Toskk's...<br>
 <br>
And the error in the spreadsheet looks like, you're taking unbuffed AP, which includes unbuffed strength; then adding buffed strength.   Thus double-counting unbuffed strength?</div>

</div>The most common reason is that in a raid setting, most, if not all resto druids have imp MOTW because it makes up the first five points of their tree.<br>
<br>
Even in your case, it's not worth investing points in imp motw when you're only doing 10 man raids (just judging from your gear on armory).</div>

42-66 = 24 AP<br>
18 expertise.<br>

So you gain ~0.8% crit compared to 18 expertise (essentially 1.125% hit, although it rounds down so it's actually 1% iirc). I'd probably take the Searing Grip, but it's a close call.</div>

They may be slightly worse or just equal than <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28506"><span><span class="purplename">[Gloves of Dexterous Manipulation]</span></span></a>, however there is more to them than just theorycrafted DPS values. Searing Grips give you more survivability with more Sta/AC and they actually smoothen out your DPS cycles by reducing dodges. I think the last part is not given enough value by most people but I doubt I am the only one that messes up Powershifts just because the mob dodged your Rip or proceed to Mangle/Shred just because you realized too late that your Rip from before didn't connect, effectively wasting DPS. So unless we are all robots, this is something worth considering for sure.</div>

</div>I use the pants and shoulders for T4 2pc atm.  Yeah my current armory is pvp (BG) gear, and it's not really ideal at that, heh.  My arena points are reserved for resto set (and the S3 staff after.)  Just transferred servers so I don't have a solid arena team yet.<br>
<br>
I'm using the helm off netherspite and the chest off nightbane right now, 2800AP/36%crit/122hit unbuffed.  It's not very good but I'm stuck in full t4 for tanking so I can't socket/enchant for cat yet.<br>
<br>
edit: Thanks for the advice, I'm definately holding on to the Searing's until patch.</div>

</div>Yeah, the short answer is yes. If your rogues all have theirs and there are nethers spare then I'd go for it for sure. The primal requirements are not too bad either, just 10 primal air and 10 primal shadow. Airs are expensive but not *too* bad to farm, and shadow are pretty easy come easy go. I'm getting one made up at the monent that will probably get socketed with full +hit gems.</div>

</div>It's ~6% dodge and ~12% parry. I'd like to see a setup that isn't stupid that actually has that much expertise - it's just not feasible to get that much as a druid with relatively good gear in other slots, in comparison to Hit which it's pretty easy to get over the cap. You would need 16*6 = 96 expertise rating to get dodge capped. Shapeshifters Signet is 20, Searing Grip is 18, One Hundred Deaths is 25, Shoulderpads of the Stranger are 10, Earthwarden is 24, and the Brooch of Deftness is 21. That's a maximum of 118 expertise rating, taken from the <a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?items&amp;filter=qu=4;ub=11;cr=117:110;crs=1:1;crv=1:0" target="_blank">WoWhead list of epics with expertise (new in the burning crusade) that's wearable as a druid</a>. It's a pretty select set of gear, to say the least, and certainly not the setup I'd pick for DPSing, even though I agree with Liar that hit and expertise have a slightly more profound effect on personal DPS compared to that given on spreadsheets (also part of the reason I prefer 4t6 over 2t4). <br>
<br>
Yes, Deep Shadow is probably the third best in slot after than Don Alejandro's/One Hundred Deaths (as long as you aren't hit capped).</div>

</div>Just found this spreadsheet and have been messing around with it, it seems like a great tool to have.  Firstly thank you, secondly there is a couple of things I'd like to discuss/comment on.<br>
<br>
I did not see an option for <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33222"><span><span class="purplename">[Nyn'jah's Tabi Boots]</span></span></a> would it be possible to have it added? Both <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=29995"><span><span class="purplename">[Leggings of Murderous Intent]</span></span></a> and <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30898"><span><span class="purplename">[Shady Dealer's Pantaloons]</span></span></a> are coming out as less dps for me then <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28741"><span><span class="purplename">[Skulker's Greaves]</span></span></a>.  This is slightly different to Toskk which ranks both of them higher in the 5000ap 50% crit region.  I picked up the Kael legs last night and was considering them for 2.3 when my gear will be pretty much rebuilt with the addition of the new heroic badge items and s3.  Anyone care to comment on these leg choices and whether you consider them an upgrade from skulkers or not. Finally when I combine the total hit and miss % it comes nearer the 8.6% mark then the 9% mark I had become familiar with, does this have much impact on the spreadsheet?<br>
<br>
[edit]added them as per the instructions[/edit]</div>

</div>If you dont have access to T6 then the gear setup with regard to set pieces should look like:<br>
<br>
Helm: S3<br>
Chest: S3<br>
Gloves: T4<br>
Shoulders: T4<br>
Legs: Heroic badge ones or Skulker's greaves (or any of the Hyjall BT offset pieces).<br>
<br>
Once you have access to T6 it should look like:<br>
<br>
Helm: S3 or Cursed Vision<br>
Chest: T4<br>
Shoulders: T4<br>
Gloves: T6<br>
Legs: T6<br>
<br>
This is mainly because of the added dps that comes in from the T6 set bonus. If you have a second druid that is mangling the T4 gloves and shoulders are the ones that provide the bestg compromise between stats and the T4 set bonus.</div>

		<div id="post_message_537745">I am starting to believe that being hit capped is more important then t4 2pc set bonus.<br>
<br>
I've done a couple of tests with different sets of gear on two raid bosses, which are Leo and Lurker.<br>
<br>
<br>
Week 1: T4 helm + T4 shoulders + T4 legs + T5 gloves + <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33204"><span><span class="purplename">[Shadowprowler's Chestguard]</span></span></a> with 80 hit rating, had 10.2% miss on melee attacks<br>
Week 2: T4 helm + <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30538"><span><span class="purplename">[Midnight Legguards]</span></span></a> + <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28601"><span><span class="purplename">[Chestguard of the Conniver]</span></span></a> + <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30055"><span><span class="purplename">[Shoulderpads of the Stranger]</span></span></a>, around 128 hit rating I only had 6.3% miss on melee attacks<br>
<br>
I don't see how it's good to stack ap/crit or 2pc set bonus gear if you are not hit capped? I've been using msbt scrolling text mod, and it's really interesting to see how often you miss when dpsing with 84 hit rating and over 130 hit rating, and WWS reports proved it to me over the two weeks. Also, don't you think hit rating is important?<br>
<br>
Personally, I would rather hit two shreds for say 2.5k- to 3k then miss two and hope I get lucky with t4 2pc set bonus procs, any one agree?</div>

		<div id="post_message_537813">Monstor-- your post proves that when you have more hit rating, you hit more. It offers no comparison of hit rating to 2t4. <br>
 <br>
Perhaps you could link the WWS parses so we could see the results of your overall DPS. <br>
 <br>
Also remember that you don't need to get "lucky" with 2t4 for it to be massively better. If you miss a shred, you only lose 8 energy, not 42. Only finishers lose all their energy when they miss. <br>
 <br>
Your choices of gear change your hit rating by 31, which would take you from 80 to 111, not 128.   Perhaps you're omitting the fact that you have your Stranger shoulders with a DPS enchant on them.   The <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30055"><span><span class="purplename">[Shoulderpads of the Stranger]</span></span></a> have no hit rating on them (and no expertise until next patch). You could get 2t4 in your claim above without lowering your hit rating simply by putting back on your T4 shoulders and enchanting them for DPS.</div>

</div>Of course it would be better to hit two Shreds rather than miss two, but with a difference of a 3.9% for your "to hit", you would have to attack with 50 Shreds before you would miss (on average) 2 of them which you wouldn't have missed anyway. Given all of the white attacks happening in there along with your specials, that's going to likely equate to more than a few procs of the 2T4 set bonus.</div>

		<div id="post_message_537943">Hit rating is not that important for normal specials. The reason is because you always get a refund of all but 8 energy for them. That means you have to miss 42/8 = 5.25 shreds before you've actually lost one full shreds worth of damage. For finishers it's different as you lose all the energy, but you don't do as many rips as you do other special attacks. This whole topic was discussed a lot in the "value of +hit" thread (see the useful links in the first post, it will probably be quite enlightening if you haven't ever read it, even if you just skip through it).<br>
<br>
And yes, as Allev pointed out you could easily use T4 shoulders with the helm and keep your pieces with +hit on. If you put pure agility gems in they're virtually equal anyway (30 AP more on Malorne compared to the 16 crit rating on Stranger - I'd take the Malorne until 2.3, unless you've gemmed them differently obviously).<br>

		<div id="post_message_538174">Greetings everybody  <br>
<br>
I'm currently in front of a difficult choice. I have 5000 arena points saved up for the season 3, i'm feral, with only the s2 shoulders and the 3 pvp battleground pieces, and i have a 2vs2 arena team with 1600 rating, that give me 350 arena points per week. As we don't know when the s3 begins actually, what should i do ? Spend 3750 points now to not waste weeks of arena until the s3 starts, and buy the s2 weapon (i have the terestian stranglestaff actually for dps), as i don't want to buy something else since the s3 gear will be very good and better than the s2 one ? I'll have 1250 points left, and i think that i'll have the time to save 1800 points to buy the s3 chest. Or should i keep these 5000 points to buy the chest, the helm and the hands when the s3 begins, that will allow me to have the 4 pieces bonus, a lot of resilience, and finally be better geared to start the new season and try to buy as soon as i can the s2 weapon or even the s3 one if i reach 1850 rating ? <br>
<br>
Thanks in advance for your advises </div>

</div>The S3 bracers, as it stands, are better than the Master Assassin's Wristwraps (though they may get nerfed meaning the Master Assassin ones will be better then). Also, the heroic badge legs are superior to the T5 legs for pure DPS (and Skulker's Greaves are better than both). Also, the Belt of Deep Shadow is better than the heroic badge belt by a little bit. Otherwise it looks pretty solid.</div>

		<div id="post_message_538386">The other way to look at + hit and specials is that every missed shred costs you 8 energy.  Considering that BT ferals tend towards energy/damage ratios of 50 or more, that's 400+ damage lost per miss.  <br>
<br>
In addition to misses futzing up rip cycles, or causing you to miss a tick or two because mangle just refuses to land.  <br>
<br>
I really like hit.  I also really like expertise, but remember that expertise is BETTER than hit for most DW classes, since hit only helps their white dps after 9% but expertise applies to both.  So warriors, rogues, and shamen want those expertise pieces more than you.  Interestingly, it's easier to rack up expertise while leveling in outlands as a feral than it is as a rogue.  It isn't until SSC that it changes appreciably.  Expertise is amazingly, awesomely good for leveling.<br>
<br>
And TWO WHOLE DAYS later I find out that the Shadowmaster's Boots I got are likely to be outperformed by a heroic badge item.  I swear ...  I could have sworn those boots weren't that good when I first looked at them.</div>

		<div id="post_message_538432">That's not a very analytical way to look at it at all. You need to analyse whether <u>overall</u> you gain or lose damage trading your AP and Crit for Hit or Expertise. That's the only metric that counts. Yes, sometimes you'll lose damage from a Rip missing a tick or mangle not being up during a Rip, but the impact of those are calculable on a statistical level. The way gear is currently itemised, a true statistical analysis will tend to show that somewhere near the hit cap and a small amount of expertise, both coming naturally from the right items do just as much or more than trying to get to the point of absolutely no misses at all.<br>
<br>
If you are referring to <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33222"><span><span class="purplename">[Nyn'jah's Tabi Boots]</span></span></a> being better than <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32366"><span><span class="purplename">[Shadowmaster's Boots]</span></span></a>, I think that is not true. The T6 item provides a small dps upgrade over the badge item and nearly double the health of the badge item if you make a number of different gear choices along the way. Also, Voldin's base spreadsheet starts with the assumption that you are using the Stormrage Signet Ring and does not include the Exalted dps version of the Band of Eternity. Choosing the Band of Eternity (exalted version) means you can choose the Choker of Endless Nightmares over Telonicus' Pendant of Mayhem, Shadowmaster's Boots over Nyn'jah's Tabi Boots, Insidious Bands over Vindicator's Dragonhide Bracers and Madness of the Betrayer over Dragonspine Trophy for an overall buffed dps increase of 2.91. Which really just stresses how important the overall effect of your gear is compared to just picking whichever items are individually the best.</div>

As for the Waistguard it just fills in an already overpopulated itemization spot i.e. feral belts with high armour, and I wouldn't waste badges on it. The Vestments I will be getting for tanking if I haven't been lucky enough to get tier 4 or tier 5 by then, but I definitely wouldn't get them just for dps, shadowprowler's is better when gemmed.</div>

Sigh. Stupid forums ate all my math.<br>
Idol = great.<br>
Boots = great.<br>
Bracers = search my posts in this thread, 4 or 5 pages back I did the math and to me at least proved S3 was a better upgrade than this so long as you needed the resilience. There are plenty of slots I'd much rather have pure tanking items than resilience items so it makes sense to use S3 bracers.<br>
<br>
Wrists: <br>
Vambraces:<br>
(32x1x1.1x1.03x1.1)+(52x1.1)=97.08 AP<br>
32/25 = 1.4% crit<br>
<br>
Shard bound<br>
(28x1x1.1x1.03x1.1)+(42x1.1)=81.1 AP<br>
28/25=1.12%<br>
<br>
Master Ass<br>
(25x1x1.1x1.03x1.1)+(50x1.1)=86.16 AP<br>
(25/25)+(18/22.1)=1.81%<br>
<br>
S3 PvP Bracers<br>
(22x2x1.1x1.03x1.1)+(30x1x1.1x1.03x1.1)=92.23 AP<br>
(30/25)+(21/22.1)= 2.15% crit<br>
<br>
So you get .69% crit and 5.06ap going from shard bound to master assasains which is a pretty solid upgrade.<br>
Going from Vambraces to Master assasain you drop 10.92ap and pick up .41% crit. Fairly debatable whether its worth it but definately a small ugprade going to Master Assasain. <br>
Edit:<br>
Had forgotten the pvp bracers. They edge out master assasains by a fair bit. As they aren't unique I'll buy a set for dps and a set for tanking/pvp.<br>
<br>
<br>
<a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33579"><span><span class="purplename">[Vestments of Hibernation]</span></span></a> <br>
I don't really rate this as an upgrade to shadowprowlers, especially with the FCR change meaning I now need even more hit. I don't know how to model armour penetration as it changes on a per mob basis. <br>
<br>
Unless I'm drastically under rating the 150 armour pen I really wouldn't ugprade from shadowprowlers to this. That said its a nice stop gap between Heavy Clefthoof and T4 for tanking.<br>
<br>
<br>
<a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33583"><span><span class="purplename">[Waistguard of the Great Beast]</span></span></a><br>
Great Beast:<br>
(29x2x1.1x1.03x1.1)+(44x1x1.1x1.03x1.1)=127.12 AP<br>
44/25=1.76% crit<br>
18 hit (dunno how to work out hit but they both have same so cancel each other out)<br>
<br>
Deep Shadow:<br>
(48x1x1.1x1.03x1.1)+(66x1.1)= 132.4224 AP<br>
48/25 = 1.92% crit<br>
<br>
So they are pretty similar, deep shadow having 5 APish more and .16% crit more but the beast has 16 more stamina and bonus armour facilitating cat and bear form fights better than the extra dodge of deep shadow. <br>
<br>
For such a low price of 20 badges I will definately get this and let someone else take vortexes. Not to mention the 5-700g depending on server prices you would save on the other mats.<br>
<br>
<br>
Hope that helped.<br>
<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Greetings everybody  <br>
<br>
I'm currently in front of a difficult choice. I have 5000 arena points saved up for the season 3, i'm feral, with only the s2 shoulders and the 3 pvp battleground pieces, and i have a 2vs2 arena team with 1600 rating, that give me 350 arena points per week. As we don't know when the s3 begins actually, what should i do ? Spend 3750 points now to not waste weeks of arena until the s3 starts, and buy the s2 weapon (i have the terestian stranglestaff actually for dps), as i don't want to buy something else since the s3 gear will be very good and better than the s2 one ? I'll have 1250 points left, and i think that i'll have the time to save 1800 points to buy the s3 chest. Or should i keep these 5000 points to buy the chest, the helm and the hands when the s3 begins, that will allow me to have the 4 pieces bonus, a lot of resilience, and finally be better geared to start the new season and try to buy as soon as i can the s2 weapon or even the s3 one if i reach 1850 rating ? <br>
<br>
Thanks in advance for your advises </div>

</div>Are you doing this mainly for PvP or PvE? For PvE saving for the S3 helm/chest is probably the biggest upgrades you'll find if you're not at top end raiding. For PvP, its probably better to save up and buy the resto S3 pieces. At the moment Resto is EXTREMELY good in the arena. If you want the shoulders/weapon eventually you're best bet is to go resto for arena and get your rating up that way.

		<div id="post_message_539169"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I was actually wondering about this myself. I'm at a comfortable 35k armour unbuffed now with Badge of Tenacity, but that Shadowmoon Insignia does look very nice. Same goes for other items such as Rings that are pretty nice tanking items, but simply lack the armour. How high should we value the stat anyway? <br>
<br>
I've always found this a bit of a pickle, and thusfar I have reasoned that armour is a stat that directly reduces the damage you take on every single physical attack, and thus it's a very important stat - too important to ditch it for some more Sta or Avoidance.<br>
<br>
However I also know druids that think differently and swap <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28660" target="_blank">[Gilded Thorium Cloak]</a> for <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=34010" target="_blank">[Pepe's Shroud of Pacification]</a> without a second thought..<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_539212"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I normally run at around 29k armour unbuffed. The offensive stats are too important while trash tanking and tanking bosses that matter (RoS offtanking, Gurtogg) to give up for a bit more armour imo, especially as you benefit with a crapload of dodge from all the agility.<br>
<br>
I use <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30098" target="_blank">[Razor-Scale Battlecloak]</a> (which will be replaced by the Heroic cloak once 2.3 gets here), <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32261" target="_blank">[Band of the Abyssal Lord]</a>, <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30629" target="_blank">[Scarab of Displacement]</a> and <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28528" target="_blank">[Moroes' Lucky Pocket Watch]</a>.

<br>
Considering Druids are supposed to be an offtank in most situations (or high-threat tank for trash/gurtogg) it makes sense to skimp a bit on the armour in favour of offensive stats. Obviously if you're MT, that's different. Agility is the most important stat once you're around 30k armour in tanking gear imo. Dodge + crit = good. You get plenty of stamina by default once you start hitting t6 to bother gemming for it unless you put 4agi/6stam (or 5agi/7stam) in blue slots for bonuses.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_539234"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Hm. I'm getting the feeling I'm seriously overdoing my defensive stats. I guess I'm mainly an offtank, though I do MT bosses now and then. I have to admit it's more exception than rule.<br>
<br>
My armory is clickable to the left, if you can be bothered, but basically I'm gemming Stamina pretty heavily (I'm at 16.7k selfbuffed) as I feel it's the most important tank stat. <br>
I have a thing for socket bonuses though, so I use Sta/Agi in red sockets, pure Sta in blue, and Agi/Hit in yellow. (If it's an item I only use for DPS I gem Agi of course).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_539235"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->As you scale Tiers of gear, it becomes easier to take non armored pieces of gear and stay at the level of armor that you want.  There was also a rumor about armor kits/enchants being added into the dire bear armor multiplier.<br>
<br>
Armor by set:<br>
T4 - 2674<br>
T5 - 2977 (+303 from T4)<br>
T6 - 3152 (+175 from T5)<br>
<br>
Also with the addition of hit rating affecting taunt, hit has become slightly more important for raiding as a resisted taunt can wipe the raid on certain fights.<br>
<br>
Adding to what dukes said, higher armor means less rage generated.  So if you are finding yourself rage starved, for whatever reason, you may want to reevaluate your stat priority towards more agility.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">That's not a very analytical way to look at it at all. You need to analyse whether <u>overall</u> you gain or lose damage trading your AP and Crit for Hit or Expertise. That's the only metric that counts. Yes, sometimes you'll lose damage from a Rip missing a tick or mangle not being up during a Rip, but the impact of those are calculable on a statistical level. The way gear is currently itemised, a true statistical analysis will tend to show that somewhere near the hit cap and a small amount of expertise, both coming naturally from the right items do just as much or more than trying to get to the point of absolutely no misses at all.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>It's perfectly reasonable basis for analysis.  Every miss is about 400 damage lost, give or take a few dozen points depending on gear and a lot more if it's a rip.  Alternatively, your miss rate directly affects the effective cost of your specials.  This is in addition to non-tangible benefits, like smoother cycles and less irritation.  It's not 'just 8 energy lost'.<br>
<br>
Remember that in any particular set of gear, some factors are linear scalars and some are % scalars.  AP is linear.  Crit is a % scalar.  Agi is a mixed scalar.  In general, as your overall dps rises and your get improves, % scalars tend to dominate over linear ones.  <br>
<br>
Expertise is great because it introduces a new % scalar that actually works for ferals, unlike haste and armor pen.  Even better, it works exactly like an existing one: Hit.  Hit is already very good for BT ferals.  Expertise will be just as good.<br>
<br>
As for resilience, the short version is resilience + agi &gt; defense.  So the pvp gear is pretty good, because you are replacing defense gear with items that tend to feature resilience and agi.  Socketing or trinketing for resilience is not, as the total effect of defense, point for point, is greater than resilience.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_539476"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->There were some posts in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080412023553/http://elitistjerks.com/f31/t13204-bear_tank_item_comparisons/" target="_blank">Bear tanking thread</a> awhile back discussing the merits of armor vs agility for high-end tanking. Conclusions seemed to be that agility is superior in terms of actual mitigation once you reach a certain amount of dodge/AC, due to the fact that dodge gives increasing returns whereas AC diminishes slightly. Sadly I can't find the exact posts now but they're in that thread somewhere.<br>
<br>
It really comes down to personal preference though and for me (and my healers) absorption &gt; avoidance. I actively dislike having too much dodge because, despite the fact I'll take less damage overall, each extra dodge % seems to increase my chances of dying exponentially - healers focus their attention elsewhere after a lucky string of dodges and aren't prepared for the three 8k crushings that come afterwards. Also, in a rage limited situation I'm not convinced that agility is a better choice for threat generation than raw AP.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Personally, I'd just say "don't keep the pants" since you're competing against rogues on everything outside of 3 tanking items at the T6 level.  I'm lucky that the <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32235" target="_blank">[Cursed Vision of Sargeras]</a> goes to me first, other druids likely won't be as lucky.<br>
<br>
e: About Tanking, Armor is very important, but so is Sta.  In BT you're already going to have a Prot warrior as required MT for several fights, so it's well worth your time (and sanity) to just go for being a great OT, where your primary concerns are being able to stay 2nd on aggro and not suck at DPS when you go catform.  This means instead of "Max Armor, and as much HP as possible" you should just be looking for "How much DPS Gear can I get away with?"  I push this as much as possible, and you'll often see me drinking <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=1" target="_blank">[Item 'ironshield elixir' not found!]</a> just to avoid wearing additional tanking gear.<br>
<br>
I will concede that Gruul/Mag/SSC favors ferals in high sta/armor gear over my current crit heavy build.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Why do you use Moroes trinket? It does not add any offensive stat and i think that for tanking dodge is not that important. If i were to choose from defensive trinkets, i'd take Badge of tenacity over Moroes, since its effect has also offensive use.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_539846"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Because I have Moroes' and I don't have a Badge. I've never seen it on the AH and I'm not mad enough to grind the Shartuul event/Blades Edge Plateau mobs to get one when it's effectively a sidegrade in overall mitigation terms to what I have. 50% avoidance without it means that adding it gives an effective 3% less damage taken without considering the use effect - I'm pretty sure that's comparable to the armour from the Badge.<br>
<br>
Quite often I switch it for Timelapse for some stuff, if I want to have more threat gen (means I can swap out other defence/resillience pieces). I would swap it in a heartbeat if Shadowmoon Insignia would drop, but it won't (and even if it did, I would've been second in line for it). <br>
Most of the time I use Moroes because it's on-use is godly in some situations, especially while trash tanking when people aren't paying attention. Fully raid buffed with both Displacement and Moroes' used I have something like 70% dodge, with 13-14% chance for the boss to miss with Scorpid sting up. It's good on fights like Gurtogg when you accidentally get agro of the boss 2 seconds before your stack should reset.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

On the other hand if id MT Teron or Morogrim my choice would be BoT and Moroes every day of the week.

</div>Yeah but gurtogg, I never have a problem with threat even before i had 2t6.  To me warriors should be trying to put on the threat gear in that fight, they always have a harder time catching up, especially at low rage.<br>

Moroes is way too good not to wear.  It is our only oh shit button and really in trash, OTing and even MTing it is just amazing and not just for druids I know our warrior MTs also wear it most of the time too.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_540253"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I would have to second the above poster. For trash/offtanking I run with Badge of Tenacity and Dragonspine Trophy. I know most druids won't have a trophy (we've had 7 drop) but any other decent dps trinket will do like an Hourglass or even an Abacus if you want to frontload some hasted threat. For everything but MTing I have ~31k armor and use the Merciless Maul, Worgen Claw Necklace and Garona's Signet for the hit. For offtanking bosses Garona's is swapped out for Shapeshifter's.<br>
<br>
It's still enough to take over maintanking if he goes down (Vashj 23%-&gt;0) but puts out respectable dps and high threat. Bloodlust + Haste Pot + Dragonspine feels almost cat speeds in bear form. Maul absolutely destroys your rage though.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Pocketwatch's strength comes from its ability to save your life! Atleast in my opinion. 15% dodge when your dodge is already pretty high, is very powerful. In comparison, Badge's "Use" only gives 10%. When you don't necessarily need the armour, its a fairly clear choice. <br>
<br>
Also the non-offensive component also means you won't be tempted to use it to gain some extra threat, and to save it for when you need it ( "OMG BEAR WALL HEPL" ) <br>
<br>
I can't tell you the amount of times its saved my life  I would definitely use Pocketwatch over almost anything in the game due to this reason - I use it combination with Shadowmoon Insignia, by the way... the 2nd part of bear wall!</div>

</div>To be fair to the Badge while it may give less dodge it does give it for twice as long - a good 20 seconds compared to the 10 seconds on Moroes. Granted if the 'oh shit' period you're using it for's brief this is a non issue but if you're dealing with a prolonged period of high incoming damage the extra duration's fantastic so I'd argue it's not as clearcut as simply whether you need the armour or not (and that's leaving aside the whole 'swap out another high armour piece argument).</div>

		<div id="post_message_541547">I have a couple questions to put in front of the pros. This guy is in Kara as offtank/DPS, and a last-resort subin for SSC/TK. Feral Druid natch. <i><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080314102057/http://www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Maelstrom&amp;n=Ledneh" target="_blank">Here's my armory for reference</a></i>, should be DPS gear.<br>
<br>
First, a DPS question. <b>When I'm fighting a bleed-immune boss like Netherspite, is it better to Ferocious Bite at five points, or just forget the points and keep shredding/refreshing Mangle? And if I do bite, should I do it with a minimum or a maximum of energy?</b> I made a WWS parse of Kara from Opera on (<i><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080314102057/http://wowwebstats.com/dseadgkxlufdq" target="_blank">here it is--I am Haze from the anonymizer</a></i>), and when I couldn't Rip, my DPS positively SUCKED ASS. Where I could Rip, I ended up quite high for my comparative gear level (top on Aran woop woop). I know without Rip my DPS will go down no matter what I do, I just didn't expect to practically bottom out on Netherspite. <br>
<br>
Second, a general tanking question. Last night without fort (but with Kings), my HP was 14.4k. It used to be about 16k before fort, but I've been nickel-and-diming away my stamina in trade for more dodge, armor, and agility/etc for threat generation (right now I sit at uncrittable, 33% dodge or so (maybe more), and 28.5k armor). So far it's been working all right, but last night I got Skulker's Greaves, which I may want to replace my Heavy Clefthoof Leggings with since I have more than enough armor, and I've still got the crit gap covered. My problem is, I'm nickel-and-diming away yet more stamina. <b>What is a reasonable threshold, for my gear level, of life pre-buffs to never want to go below?</b></div>

Feral Druid natch. <i><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080314102057/http://www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Maelstrom&amp;n=Ledneh" target="_blank">Here's my armory for reference</a></i>, should be DPS gear.<br>
<br>
First, a DPS question. <b>When I'm fighting a bleed-immune boss like Netherspite, is it better to Ferocious Bite at five points, or just forget the points and keep shredding/refreshing Mangle? And if I do bite, should I do it with a minimum or a maximum of energy?</b> I made a WWS parse of Overnight Kara from Opera on (<i><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080314102057/http://wowwebstats.com/dseadgkxlufdq" target="_blank">here it is--I am Haze from the anonymizer</a></i>), and when I couldn't Rip, my DPS positively SUCKED ASS. Where I could Rip, I ended up quite high for my comparative gear level (top on Aran woop woop). I know without Rip my DPS will go down no matter what I do, I just didn't expect to practically bottom out on Netherspite. <br>
<br>
Second, a general tanking question. Last night without fort (but with Kings), my HP was 14.4k. It used to be about 16k before fort, but I've been nickel-and-diming away my stamina in trade for more dodge, armor, and agility/etc for threat generation (right now I sit at uncrittable, 33% dodge or so (maybe more), and 28.5k armor). So far it's been working all right, but last night I got Skulker's Greaves, which I may want to replace my Heavy Clefthoof Leggings with since I have more than enough armor, and I've still got the crit gap covered. My problem is, I'm nickel-and-diming away yet more stamina. <b>What is a reasonable threshold, for my gear level, of life pre-buffs to never want to go below?</b></div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>It's worth using FB on bleed-immune mobs, try to use it with as little energy left as possible, the energy-damage ratio on the extra energy is absolutely terrible.  If I'm at high energy when getting ready to FB I usually dump some energy by mangling or shredding first.<br>
<br>
I wouldn't sacrifice more stamina and armor by switching to the greaves, you're still a good amount of armor away from the level 70 armor cap (31.2k'ish), and I would shoot for that at least.  Dodge is very nice, and agility is great for bears, but I'd keep my HP high too.  You'll find many bosses who can do some pretty good burst damage, and dodge simply isn't reliable enough for those fights.  Generally druids are preferred tanks for those fast hitting, high burst potential bosses due to their high armor/hp and the fact that a warrior often can't keep SB up, so having low HP there means you will not be able to fulfill that role very well (some examples are Malchezaar in T4 or the shaman on Karathress in T5).<br>
<br>
Personally I'd turn the greaves into pure dps legs, and I wouldn't worry too much about sacrificing tanking stats for offensive stats, at least not in T4/T5.  Your TPS should be plenty high, and having high HP/armor will make fights like Karathress much easier.</div>

		<div id="post_message_541671">Hello.<br>
<br>
I have a question and I hope that you guys can help me.<br>
<br>
I have a number of well-geared feral druids in my guild.  They have pretty good gear but their DPS is sub-par.  They make great tanks, but when it comes time for them to dps, they are really lacking - always dead last or close to it.<br>
<br>
Our progression is 6/6 SSC and working on kael in the eye.  Does anyone have any wws or anything of feral druids doing well (top 50%) on the damage meters?<br>
<br>
Thanks.</div>

<br>
Thanks for the advice. Hopefully tonight I can slap on my bear gear and do a side-by-side of my cat and bear gear, and find out exactly where I would stand rather than my memory guesstimates.<br>
<br>
Actually before a few weeks ago I would have immediately agreed that sta and armor are king, and dodge can go fuck right off. I had like 16k life, 28k armor, and a pathetic 24% dodge or something like that. I've since learned the error of my ways--I just fear I overcompensated.<br>
<br>
It must be a rough deal for Warriors, having to balance all that shit plus a higher Defense need and block/parry </div>

Sure, it's not showing amazing DPS, but it's middle-of-the-pack, which is better than nothing. On most fights I'll admit that I'm generally bottom of the pack while DPSing, but as long as there isn't a significant gap between the bottom person and me, I'm not unhappy.<br>
<br>
Fureflower: Rawrman is using rake (big no), he's using Ravage (really shouldn't), he's using Fero Bite when it's lower average damage than Shred (which is a big no unless he's making sure it's only costing 35 energy, and even then it's not worth it). He uses cat mangle randomly (like 5 times on each thing, which is random in my eyes) and doesn't seem to have a proper DPS cycle. Hunglykabull (nice name btw) also uses rake, uses mangle a lot more than he should (50/50 with shred, which is too much generally), but other than that seems to be doing OK. <br>
Gearing for both of them should be covered by the first post, so I won't bother going in to that.</div>

</div>Rip is much nicer than Ferocious Bite, but it wasn't one of the main factors in your relatively poor performance on Netherspite according to your WWS reports.<br>
<br>
First, you were not in the rotation for the dps beam on Netherspite for your winning attempt. The two warlocks were. I'm assuming that the 2 warlocks were each tanking a full stage of the dps beam and relying on life drain to bail them out for heals. That's not going to work as well next patch since life drain will actually be affected by the healing debuff they accumulate. Post patch, it would seem to be a better strategy to have a melee dps take the first half of the dps beam in a stage and have the warlocks take the second half (since they can continue to dps from range during the netherbreath stage). The best part is that this strategy will work whether you have 2 warlocks in your raid or not. In any case, if you'd had taken some dps beam time away from the warlocks, you would have had more dps.<br>
<br>
Secondly, if you look at melee hits landed, every other melee landed far more hits than you. You only landed 2 minutes worth of melee hits and 2 minutes worth of skill attacks in a 6 minute fight. Usually, you should spend twice as much time in melee as out of it due to the stages of the fight. 3.5 minutes worth of melee hits and 3.5 minutes worth of skill attacks would definitely have boosted your dps way up. The rogue was much closer to that ideal time spent attacking with enough attacks for 4 minutes worth of energy (I can only assume he is combat spec and therefore has extra incoming energy). Can we assume that you aren't very confident with the Netherspite encounter or that it was your first time fighting him? In any case, I think we can confidently state that more time dpsing means more dps.</div>

</div>You are correct about the DPS beam being assigned to the warlocks, though the fact that they never drained life according to the WWS and my memory makes me think that perhaps our strategy as far as the blue beam goes is flawed. Not that it matters since, as you say, it won't work in 2.3 anymore--I just thought I'd make the point that they were SB spamming and being healed through the damage instead of draining.<br>
<br>
My low DPS time can be partly explained by the fact that I got instagibbed about two minutes before he went down. I only just learned this morning that he does, in fact, reset aggro and use a normal table between the time he unbanishes and the time the red beam is taken. This is what gibbed me, I kept up melee during the unbanish and got blown away. In the future I will remember to back off until the portals are in place.<br>
<br>
I imagine, however, that you already took my early death into account. This is my third Karazhan run but the first one where I bothered to look at combat logs, so I was unfamiliar with WWS. I looked at my own DPS report and--jesus christ, only 15 or so Shreds the whole encounter? I would swear I did more than that, but the WWS doesn't exactly lie. I cannot explain why I did so few; I possibly simply wasn't paying attention and fell victim to cat melee bugs (I can never figure out whether you can be in skill range but not melee range, or melee range but not skill range--maybe it's both at different times).<br>
<br>
At any rate, I guess the lessons for me here are three-fold:<br>
<br>
- Pay attention to range, since melee range != skill range<br>
- Discuss allocation of the beams--maybe Green should be passed around to manaless classes more for reduced costs, and Blue passed around more to prevent massive damage from the aoe?<br>
- Pay more attention to when aggro gets dumped; until just this morning I thought there were no aggro dumps for Netherspite at all<br>
<br>
Anything else I should be taking home from this?</div>

Sure, it's not showing amazing DPS, but it's middle-of-the-pack, which is better than nothing. On most fights I'll admit that I'm generally bottom of the pack while DPSing, but as long as there isn't a significant gap between the bottom person and me, I'm not unhappy.<br>
<br>
Fureflower: Rawrman is using rake (big no), he's using Ravage (really shouldn't), he's using Fero Bite when it's lower average damage than Shred (which is a big no unless he's making sure it's only costing 35 energy, and even then it's not worth it). He uses cat mangle randomly (like 5 times on each thing, which is random in my eyes) and doesn't seem to have a proper DPS cycle. Hunglykabull (nice name btw) also uses rake, uses mangle a lot more than he should (50/50 with shred, which is too much generally), but other than that seems to be doing OK. <br>
Gearing for both of them should be covered by the first post, so I won't bother going in to that.</div>

</div>Teron is nice, but it's still no patchwerk either.  Even if you soulstone the people that get shadow of death, they still spend ~1 minute 15'ish seconds not doing any damage, and will come back completely unbuffed.  So long as you don't get shadow yourself, it's relatively easy to stay in the middle somewhere in terms of dps, since a few dps will have to spend a minute as ghost and come back (assuming they're brezzed/ss'd) unbuffed.<br>
<br>
On a completely unrelated note, does primal tenacity stack with predatory instincts when dealing with aoe fears or stuns?  I've heard both, and if tenacity doesn't improve the fear/stun resist chance from 15% to 30%, that would greatly decrease it's value in raids (where single target fears and stuns aren't very common).</div>

</div>My guess would be as long as talent points have been spent in Predatory Instincts, you get to have two resist rolls against AoE-stuns and fears (going by logic every character already has a built in resist chance to malicious effects in general, so Primal Tenacity only adds to the amount, while Instincts give additional resists to AoEs).<br>
<br>
Edit: So they stack, albeit indirectly.</div>

</div>I noticed a couple of minor mistakes in your spreadsheet.<br>
<br>
Your name define for RingStats is off by one row, should be Ring!$A$2:$T$30 instead of Ring!$A$3:$T$30<br>
<br>
Also the RingList is messed up in that the formula is duplicated for one of the lines.<br>
"=IF(ISNA(INDIRECT("A"&amp;MATCH(V18,$U$2:$U$29,0))),"",INDIRECT("A"&amp;MATCH(V18,$U$2:$U$29  ,0)+1))"<br>
<br>
Nordrassil Feral-Kilt you have the 18 hit rating as 18 dodge rating.<br>
<br>
I really like this spreadsheet though.  It has a lot of the things I was trying to do with my own spreadsheet.  Would love to see it expanded for bear as well.  Keep up the good work.</div>

Correct me if I'm wrong (and provide proof) but Siphon Life adds about 65 DPS, and rip provides 100.  Considering that SL heals as well as does damage, I'd say they are equally deserving of a debuff slot.<br>
<br>
Here's my math:<br>
<br>
Siphon Life: 4530 damage + healing*0.5<br>
Shadowbolt normalized to 1.5 seconds: 1675.35 damage<br>
Damage added by Siphon Life: (4530 - 1675.35) / 30 seconds = 95.155 DPS<br>
<br>
Rip: 3618 damage<br>
Ferocious Bite normalize to 30 energy: 2011.77<br>
Damage added by Rip: (3618 - 2011.77) / 16 seconds = 100.389375 DPS<br>
<br>
Edit: This assumes using ferocious bite at 40 energy every 16 seconds, which is optimistic, but since shred is similar dpe to FB, I don't think it will affect my numbers that much.</div>

This is, of course, with the current implementation of powershifting. Once powershifting becomes a one button affair that is not so horribly less useful due to Aussie lag... meh. I'll probably keep doing it so I don't fall asleep.</div>

This spreadsheet includes both DPS and tanking calculations. It supports selecting a DPS cycle model and a tank point model. In addition, the calculator can mix models to determine an off-tank value. A weight can be set to scale between dps or tanking. DPS cycles available range from custom models for mangle only, shred only, or "standard" mangle/shred to 4+ cp. I'm currently working on bear threat as a DPS model as well. Any alternative model can be integrated in based on stats/gear/talents.</div>

</div>Sorry I'm not sure what you're after. Critique?<br>
<br>
Well going purely from your gear on Armoury, you use a lot of tanking gear in your DPS set. Whilst it may be you logged out after trash or something if thats your DPS gear I could suggest a few changes.<br>
<br>
The cloak is pretty terrible. Tons of better upgrades from blues to epics. Even the blue Mechanar cloak is better. You clearly like your hit rating but I think you'd find a much better configuration to drop some hit (including the pos trinket) and add in Shapeshifters Signet. Of course thats only gonna last a week now till it changes to Expertise but after that theres a couple of ZA and Heroic Badge leather with hit on.<br>
<br>
T5 chest is nice but with the gem choices you may find a higher DPS with a lower chest (T4, Shadowprowlers etc...) with fully DPS optimised gems (full 8 or 10 agi). Same applies to legs.<br>
<br>
Also swapping in T4 shoudlers for T5 (gemmed for DPS and enchanted with DPS scryer enchant) and swapping out T4 gloves for <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28506"><span><span class="purplename">[Gloves of Dexterous Manipulation]</span></span></a> would be a fairly solid DPS increase. T4 gloves really do blow.</div>

</div>You seem to be doing the right things in the right proportions (I guess the FB was a it's-nearly-dead finisher?), comparing straight to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080113085412/http://wowwebstats.com/5vq3ew5zrzgaa?s=7079-7297" target="_blank">my Anetheron</a> yesterday.<br>
<br>
Vaccine's given a ton of good advice I won't duplicate here, but I'll just point out the big difference I noticed between our two kills -- you seem to have really low crit. Get more. <br>
<br>
The T5 setbonus isn't really worth it for DPS (except on a few select fights; I use it on Naj'entus, for example) so offset rogue gear with specific DPS enchants would probably help a lot, plus better trinkets.</div>

I have a question and I hope that you guys can help me.<br>
<br>
I have a number of well-geared feral druids in my guild.  They have pretty good gear but their DPS is sub-par.  They make great tanks, but when it comes time for them to dps, they are really lacking - always dead last or close to it.<br>
<br>
Our progression is 6/6 SSC and working on kael in the eye.  Does anyone have any wws or anything of feral druids doing well (top 50%) on the damage meters?<br>

It should be rather hard to get to 100% of that value since it means a fault free rotation but still some should be able to get with the respective Equipment and so on 80% at least with improvement possibilities.</div>

</div>I do not hold back with aggro on hydross (my dmg is not big enough with the whirls). I am not sure if ranged can do dmg during spout,  but if they cant or the ability is limited that would be + for melee who do dmg all the time (except whirls).<br>

However some of the people below me are casuals who fill our SSC raids on bosses which we farm and their dmg output is not top class. Which is soon to be changed, since it takes us too long to get to Vashj tbh.</div>

The gist of the thread is that FF doesn't stack with Sunder, the guy claims to have tested it in a duel with a warrior(having the warrior spell reflect his FF).<br>
<br>
Suffice to say, I trust posters on the WoW forums about as far as I can throw them(and have you ever tried throwing someone over an internet connection? It's harder than you think).  I am at work and can't test it right now.  <br>
  So... has anyone checked and made sure that FF and sunder stack lately?  The thread I linked doesn't look at damage... it just looked at character sheet armor I believe.</div>

		<div id="post_message_543966">Cheers again for the update Voldin.  I noticed that i get an increase in dps when switching an 8agi gem to a 4agi/4hit gem or an 8agi gem to an 8hit gem below the hit cap.  Effectively saying that 1hit &gt; 1agi below the hit cap.  This may go someway to explaining the high weighting noticed on skulker's greaves compared to the Kael legs and Azgalor legs.  This is new to me though compared to the Mijae's spreadsheet posted above and the Toskk methodology where agi is valued as greater then hit.  I was wondering what was the reason for this?  Is is accurate? Do you perhaps have a factor there to deal with a miss screwing up a cycle or such?  Also I was wondering could a temporary weapon enchant be added similar to Mijae's sheet and also the ring enchants please?<br>
<br>
Between the 2 spreadsheets also with the same gear I noticed a rather large dps discrepancy approximately 250 dps I was wondering what the reason for this is and again which is more accurate?<br>
<br>

</div>You need to enable "5 Man" drops on the right side for the Hourglass. I have not dug very deeply into Voldin's modelling yet. I try to verify my calculations against WWS meters and seems to be fairly accurate. <br>
<br>
Also, Lolaan and Tangedyn DPS models have been re-enabled and updated for expertise. Note - these are slightly modifed from their available versions. I believe mine takes many more factors into concideration. For example, Tangedyn's online calculator does not reduce damage for mob armor.<br>

Fixed double dipping on SOTF.<br>
<br>
I can't really say why my sheet values hit higher than some of the other sheets out there.  I am not familiar enough with how everyone else is modeling this stuff to know what would be different.<br>
<br>
As for differences between sheets, I can only say that my sheet has tons of buffs that you can select (or not) that can have a very large impact on your DPS.  Double check to make sure all the buffs are the same.<br>
<br>
Band of the Eternal champion isn't in there because I have no idea how to model it at this point.  When I have more time, I'll try to get it worked in.</div>

</div>Actually, it's not possible to hit the armor cap in T4 without relying on buffs like Inspiration. In T5 you can hit it with Devotion Aura (maybe barely with some new 2.3 loot). At the T6 level, you are better off switching to lower armor items with higher stats than dropping Thick Hide.</div>

</div>What would you put the point(s) into otherwise? In my raid spec, I can get everything I want and have one point left over that I put into either Intensity or Primal Tenacity - neither of which I think are necessary for feral. I'd consider swapping out some armor pieces before removing points in thick hide - Supremus ring comes to mind, but a lower armor cape, wrist or belt would probably work well too.</div>

</div>Voldin, I've been analyzing your spreadsheet and looking at adding it as an optional model. However, I have found a few problems that could account for at least a portion of the DPS differences. It looks like the base damage and multipliers for your Rip damage do not follow the standard values. You're applying the Mangle buff to Rip twice. The miss and dodge calculations do not match between melee attacks and specials and expertise is not applied correctly. These are a few I've found, but only looking at the Buffed Cycles. It also looks like some of the talent point numbers were deleted on the "Races" sheet and broke validation lists.</div>

</div>I got my Rip numbers from my own in game testing, and worked backwards from there by removing multipliers like Naturalist to get a base value.  I have long since deleted the #'s from those tests, but if anybody has any data I could use to double check, I'd be happy to run through that exercise again.<br>

Nice catch on the Double Mangle Buff, I fixed that one already.  I'm going to take some time to make a few cosmetic improvements also.  I should have the changes done shortly.</div>

</div>Absolutely. My point is just that he's asking for a comparison of the TPS stat vs. mitigation stats. You can't really compare the two outside of a specific context.<br>
<br>
As an example, when I'm tanking Leotheras I always put on my <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30834"><span><span class="purplename">[Shapeshifter's Signet]</span></span></a> instead of my <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28675"><span><span class="purplename">[Shermanar Great-Ring]</span></span></a> because the most important thing is picking him up after whirlwinds and you often only have one or two shots at him before he runs off, so you have to make sure they hit. Plus, Leo hits like a sissy. On the other hand, I would never think of making that switch against Morogrim because he hits like a tank and threat is never a problem in that fight since DPS is often taking time to kill murlocs.<br>
<br>
Neither ring is necessarily "better" than the other.</div>

</div>There are four reasons why I want to write a combat simulator:<br>
<br>
1. Theorycraft models vary and are only as good as their assumptions. Assuming that I get the mechanics right (a big assumption, but I'm an optimist), a simulator should be very accurate. There will still be issues with it being PC driven - it won't account for mis-timed powershifts, etc., but it should be pretty close. Every model out there for feral DPS has to make certain assumptions and in a lot of cases those assumptions can make a big difference. This is obvious from the fact that some models differ from each other by a substantial amount.<br>
<br>
2. Some things are just too tricky to model. For example, some models make haste simply increase DPS by a scalable amount. Your attacks increase in speed by 2% so your DPS goes up by 2%. The problem is, feral combat has a LOT of interdependent parts. If I'm attacking more frequently I'm probably critting more, I'm getting more OOC procs, I'm getting more energy back from the 2T4 bonus, etc.  Of course, if I manage to get more free attacks I might get to a Rip faster. There's also the case where a Rip may be available back-to-back with another. In that case extra energy or free yellow attacks to get more CPs don't give as great an effect as they would otherwise, because you can't get a Rip up any faster than you already have.<br>
<br>
3. It's easier to make changes to DPS strategies or to add new mechanics. This is mostly just IMO, but if I decide that I want to try shred to CP5 instead of shred to CP4 then it's easy to make that change in the code's logic. In a model, depending on assumptions that you've made, you may need to remodel parts of it. This can also be true as Blizzard adds things like expertise. Of course, it depends on the model itself, but a lot of changes to feral combat can mean a complete overhaul for a model.<br>
<br>
4. I'm getting tired of database design and programming. I'm itching to get back to some C++ or C#. I've practically forgotten how to program in anything other than SQL. <br>
<br>
The models that some people have put out there are fantastic. I just think that something like this to go along with them might be useful.</div>

		<div id="post_message_545365">I don't get what you mean by DPS simulator in contrast to a DPS calculator (like Toskks). The only thing i can assume that you mean a simulator takes actual dice rolls instead of modelling statistically. The consequence would be that it is just more inaccurate than a DPS calculator.<br>
<br>
I wrote a DPS calculator but it is just code atm (no interface). I pretty much gave up on it since i realised Toskk has effectively done the same and already a good interface standing. Just look over the code (it's simple javascript so you won't have problems if you know C) and you'll see that it takes quite some factors into account.<br>
<br>
All simple combatstats (like haste as you mentioned) are calculated correctly and are as accurately as it gets in a model. The one thing that is hard to model are synergy effects with procs and haste and lag / human error.</div>

As of 2.3 (which is to say, as of tomorrow or so) my Shapeshifter's signet will go back to the bank and I will be losing, like most of us, 3% hit right there. According to what I've read so far, +hit for ferals (talking about dps here) was quite good but not good enough to gear for it instead of agi (point for point). I still managed, grabbing things here and there, to get about 80 hit rating, which coupled with feral weapon skill would bring me reasonably close to the hit cap.<br>
<br>
However this situation will change soon, and as much as missing 0.5% hit didn't look like a big deal for a kitty, missing 3.5% seems like another thing entirely. I have browsed the list of gear currently in game and I've noticed that most of the dps gear with +hit came from either Karazhan or t6 content, but few from t5. I think the fact that there is so much +hit on t6 gear is that there's about no itemization for ferals there, so we must share the loot of rogues, and rogue items typically have a lot of +hit.<br>
<br>
Anyhow, what are the best options right now to close the huge +hit gap that we will experience soon?

And more particularly, what should a cat wear in t6 content, when not able to get t6 gear yet? The only competitive items I can think of with +hit on them are Edgewalker Longboots, Garona's Signet Ring, Worgen Claw Necklace and the Stranglestaff. There's also Midnight Legguards but they are not so good for druids anyway.<br>

</div>Very accurate given a very large number of cycles.  Again, what is the practical use? Especially Toskk's work has been consistent and accurate enough to both ballpark my DPS limitations to a fairly consistent degree.  Given the ballpark is right, all the practical use cases are covered in gear upgrades and so on, and there's simply too much gear to run a simulator for each piece.  <br>
 <br>
I guess where the simulator would shine is in evaluating DPS cycles, but luckily Toskk has already done that legwork with his calculator. <br>

</div>First-- the testing available on OoC procs isn't at all conclusive as to the mechanism.  The last I'd heard, the most extensive testing of OoC procs is that it has a high likelihood of proccing at the very beginning of a fight, and less over extended periods; but has no cooldown, as you can get back-to-back procs or refreshes of the OoC effect.  Similarly, there's been no testing at all as to whether this proc is significantly affected by haste-- probably because no druids have ever been in a position to acquire a large amount of haste gear. <br>
 <br>
I could take a guess at mechanics (my first guess would be two independent timers able to proc OoC, one with a higher chance with cooldown and the other with a lower chance), but that's really all it is-- a guess.  <br>
 <br>
Finally, while the scenarios you point out are relevant and show a weakness of a calculator, a simulator would still have to make assumptions of the perfect things to do in every single scenario (or at least perfectly typical).  What do you do when you have 3CPs, you get feared, and you come back with no mangle up? OK, you mangle, and it crits-- then what? Rip, shred as long as you can?  And you have every one of these odd situations to look at, because they'll occur on a long simulation (even on a sequence of misses).   If you add to the REAL benefits of simulation, i.e. modeling actual bossfights, you get a lot more decisions that you have to account for. <br>

</div>I will say that its most compelling use in for modeling multiple types of combat, i.e. different cycles on a static boss, or bosses where you have to run out every 40 seconds (thus needing very precise cycles), or bosses with interrupt/mind control procs, and if you do start on this project, that is where I believe the most useful information would lie.</div>

if i get the 3 peices of s3 honor loot (boots,bracers (with socket bonus),belt) adding up to 71 resilience, along with the 23 defense of shemanar, 19 defense of violet signet, and the 22 defense of juggernaut, that should be put over the crit-immune cap, right?<br>
<br>
as i said, im really bad at math, but im pretty sure that would put me far enough over the cap to lose the vindicators belt, and get <a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33583" target="_blank">Waistguard of the Great Beast - Items - World of Warcraft</a> and still remain capped, or just below it?  that would be 64 defense rating, and 45 resilience without the belt.<br>

that would be a bit over 1% in +defense, and about 1.4% in resilience according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304064911/http://www.wowwiki.com/Combat_Rating_System#Resilience" target="_blank">Combat rating system - WoWWiki - Your guide to the World of Warcraft</a> ,i think.</div>

</div>Dodge calculation is still wrong (it should be expertise * 0.25%).<br>
Miss calc is still different between melee and specials (effectively only for non-boss fights).<br>
For crit calculation, you add a constant 21.2 agility. Why?<br>
Specials crit percent does not reflect 2 roll system. This was correct in previous version.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">There are four reasons why I want to write a combat simulator:<br>
<br>
1. Theorycraft models vary and are only as good as their assumptions. Assuming that I get the mechanics right (a big assumption, but I'm an optimist), a simulator should be very accurate. There will still be issues with it being PC driven - it won't account for mis-timed powershifts, etc., but it should be pretty close. Every model out there for feral DPS has to make certain assumptions and in a lot of cases those assumptions can make a big difference. This is obvious from the fact that some models differ from each other by a substantial amount.<br>
<br>
2. Some things are just too tricky to model. For example, some models make haste simply increase DPS by a scalable amount. Your attacks increase in speed by 2% so your DPS goes up by 2%. The problem is, feral combat has a LOT of interdependent parts. If I'm attacking more frequently I'm probably critting more, I'm getting more OOC procs, I'm getting more energy back from the 2T4 bonus, etc.  Of course, if I manage to get more free attacks I might get to a Rip faster. There's also the case where a Rip may be available back-to-back with another. In that case extra energy or free yellow attacks to get more CPs don't give as great an effect as they would otherwise, because you can't get a Rip up any faster than you already have.<br>
<br>
3. It's easier to make changes to DPS strategies or to add new mechanics. This is mostly just IMO, but if I decide that I want to try shred to CP5 instead of shred to CP4 then it's easy to make that change in the code's logic. In a model, depending on assumptions that you've made, you may need to remodel parts of it. This can also be true as Blizzard adds things like expertise. Of course, it depends on the model itself, but a lot of changes to feral combat can mean a complete overhaul for a model.<br>
<br>
4. I'm getting tired of database design and programming. I'm itching to get back to some C++ or C#. I've practically forgotten how to program in anything other than SQL. <br>
<br>
The models that some people have put out there are fantastic. I just think that something like this to go along with them might be useful.</div>

	</tbody></table>
</div>I've written a simple combat simulator for Cat Druids about 2 months back, to investigate the actual usefulness of +hit (it turns out that getting to the hitcap is overrated and point for point, hitrating is not as useful as plain stats like STR or AGI). It's rather basic, has no user-interaction (all DPS stats are hardcoded) and the coding is far from pretty (I'm more of a "I'm happy it compiles" programmer), but you can use it as a basis for your own program if you want. With the settings that it currently has, the deviation of the outcome of one run from the long term average is about 0.2%.<br>
<br>
The program is written in C and compiled with the OpenWatcom compiler under Windows. I'm not entirely sure whether it will immediately compile on other platforms, but no more than minor tweaking should be required.<br>

</div>The problem with that is that there are generally much better options for the trinket slot, whereas you can pick up hit all over on other gear. <br>
<br>
For the neck I'll use it on all trash and any boss where you can't really afford misses, Leotheras being given as a good example. Hydross another one for picking up adds. Its a nice neck for any fight where either high TPS is needed or fast pickups where a missed mangle is going to mean someone else gets aggro.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">About Lacerate.  Swipe is almost always better than simply spamming Lacerate (Lacerate spam being the 295 threat)<br>
<br>
155 damage over 15 seconds per stack, stacking 5 times, effected by Mangle debuff, this works out to 201.5 per tic.  I usually attempt to refresh around 7 seconds left, between the 4th and 5th tic, this allows 2 attempts to land Lacerate in case of a dodge/parry/miss on the first cast.  So in essence I'm only getting 4 tics, you can never get all 5 without letting lacerate expire, and then you're wasting rage building it back up to 5.<br>
<br>
201.5 * 4 * .2 = 161.2 + 295 = 456.2 threat.  This works out to be equal to a 272 Swipe.<br>
<br>
I could be wrong, but I don't think we'll ever see that kind of swipe in reasonable tanking gear.</div>

</div><br>
No you haven't calculated anything wrong. I don't know what Boevis was ranting about there, his post is confusing. <br>
<br>
I think hes trying to justify keeping a max stack of Lacerate ticking in between swipe spam. <br>
<br>
<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px; ">
	<div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom:0px"><img src="assets/citation.gif" border="0"></div>
	<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" border="0" width="100%">
	<tbody><tr>
		<td class="alt2" style="border:1px inset">
			
				201.5 * 4 * .2 = 161.2 + 295 = 456.2 threat. This works out to be equal to a 272 Swipe.
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>This is 201.5 per tick of lacerate with mangle up.<br>
The 4 is how many ticks he has before renewing.<br>
The .2 is the threat modifier on lacerates bleed effects so the 806 bleed damage only works out as 161.2 damage worth of threat. Then he adds in the threat of the lacerate that hes using to renew the stack and adding the previous 4 (or next 4) mangle ticks to that lacerate's threat. <br>
<br>
Lacerate threat is:<br>
<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px; ">
	<div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom:0px"><img src="assets/citation.gif" border="0"></div>
	<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" border="0" width="100%">
	<tbody><tr>
		<td class="alt2" style="border:1px inset">
			
				Innate (frontload) threat: 285 <br>
Threat from direct damage and bleed: 20% of damage done (aka. 1000 damage = 200 threat regardless of bleed or direct damage).
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>So his 295 flat threat figure includes the upfront damage of 50.<br>
<br>
The bit that confuses me is the leap from a 456.2 threat lacerate stack refresh to a 272 swipe. I can't remember if swipe has a threat modifier but as far as I'm aware the old 175% one was removed n 2.0.10 and it was just pure damage done from then.<br>
<br>
So the 272 figure is strange. Unless I'm totally missing something 456.2 is the exact damage swipe would need to do to beat even keeping lacerate up at all. <br>
<br>
Including bearform and bearfiance the 272 is 394.4 threat whereas if you include that in the lacerate + 4 bleeds one it comes out at 661.49.<br>
<br>
So to sum up as far as I'm aware, your lacerate is doing  a flat 295 aggro on a hit. You also get maybe 1 tick per application for another 155/0.2 = 31 threat so 326 threat. So you'd need a 326 damage average on your swipe to beat this, less on bleed immune.</div>

		<div id="post_message_547740"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I get the modifier, but I'm curious what "[nostance]" and "[nostance:1]" actually do in that macro.<br>
<br>
On PTR I was using a very basic one:<br>
<br>
#show Cat Form<br>
/cancelform<br>
/cast Cat Form (Shapeshift)<br>
<br>
<br>
You can add the /use lines for potions, healthstones and anything else that doesn't use up a GCD right after /cancelform.<br>
<br>
Also, is it possible to use modifiers inversely to how Nazta is using them? I.e. he's got the modifier to not /cancelform unless ctrl/alt are also pressed. I want the modifier to "/cast Cat Form (Shapeshift)" if ctrl/alt are NOT pressed. This is so I can use the same macro to return to caster form only if ctrl/alt are down, but otherwise shift me back to whatever form the macro is for. I hope that's not too confusing.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Second line just makes sure you don't cast the spell while in bear form, as this would make you leave bearform as well.<br>

You can use the "[nomodifier]". But unless you're putting in more stuff it's not really needed. I was a little confused, because it sounded like you just want a normal button(one click to enter form and another click to leave form again).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
My Swipes going up to 450 on crit. So if the average Swipe is about 210 with 30% crit in tacking gear that would mean an average damage of 273 damage from Swipe which is just above your value.<br>
<br>
Did I calculate something wrong or was that allready taken into account?</div>

</div>By "average" I was refering to a non-crit swipe.  My math was wrong though, as I was counting full damage from non-crits.  It should be: <br>
<br>
D = Damage<br>
C = Crit %<br>
H = Regular Hit %<br>
<br>
456.2 = D * H + D * C * 2.2<br>
or<br>
456.2/(H + C * 2.2) = D<br>
<br>
At 35% Crit and ignoring miss this resultes in a base damage of swipe being 321.26 in order to match Lacerate Refresh.<br>

You should maybe point out that stacking sunder will, aside from that undesirable increase in your threat, also result in a large DPS increase for: themselves, Rogues, Enhancement Shamans, Hunters, Retribution Paladins, (Felguards?!) and Cat Druids. Unless you're talking about trash, in which case it's understandable, and also not that big a deal. But on bosses, you need to pull some ears =x<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Restating what was said above, the only times where it did not shift me back in IMMEADIATLY was when I was still currently inside a GCD.  Ill have to try a modifier on my normal shift macros, currently I have a shapeshift cat macro and a powershifting one.  Quick shifting between forms and instant casting abilities from caster or another form is also infinitely useful in terms of both pve and pvp!<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Also, dukes would you by any chance compare your old WWS with new reports as of this week and see how much of your dps has increased? What do you think about using the mangle idol for raiding? I know idol of terror is pretty much the best PvP idol since the proc rate seems just amazing.</div>

	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>1) DPS differences vary pretty hugely even on the same boss with the same gear, so I'm not sure how good a comparison could be made (I have parses from Teron which vary from around 1100 DPS to just over 1500 DPS with virtually identical gear just because of other stuff going on).<br>
2) I quit raiding (well, playing in general as raiding was just about all I did) about 2 weeks ago, so I actually won't have any WWS's to compare.<br>
3) The mangle idol seems pretty comparable/better than the other idols on offer as far as I can tell from all the theorycrafting thats gone on about it. The proc rate is around 85% with a non-refreshability (10 second cd) on it (I believe, that's the last I heard on it anyway). If you've gone for higher AP rather than crit, it's probably less worth it (you'll get less crits = less primal fury = longer between mangles/rips = less refreshing of the buff) but as long as you've gone the standard route of stacking agility it's probably pretty similar. <br>
<br>
I'll be going through the main posts over the next couple of days and removing all the pre-2.3 stuff and updating whatever needs it for the new patch once it's clear what changes have been made (in case the patch notes/final PTR build/actual build aren't the same, which often happens).<br>
<br>
I'll also be sticking in a macro's section to the main post, which will include the basics (cat powershift, bear healthstone/pot macro, additions in case you want a modifier for cat shifting to be on the same button as powershifting or whatever) but I'm open to suggestions as to extra ones to add.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_549748">The new Idol seems pretty insane.<br>
<br>
The procrate is 85% according to the Wowhead spell description.<br>
<br>
The idol basically increases your agility by 65 each time your mangle ability hits.<br>
<br>
With Blessing of Kings and Survival of the Fittest, it's close to 74 agility.<br>
<br>
That's close to 3% crit chance, 5% dodge chance and 80 cat attack power.<br>
<br>
<br>
My question is: how much gear do you need for this to become effectively better than the +88 to shred idol?<br>

For me this last patch was a HUGE buff as previously I would either place dead last on DPS meters or some place on the lower half. It was pretty much like this during the entire night. Would be nice to see similar reports from other Druids to see how they are doing now as well. <br>

</div>From strictly an itemization standpoint, the food gives the exact same amount as all the others - 20 points. I guess it really depends on your gear, etc. but if your gear's gem slots gave you the choice, 20agi food and 4 5hit/5agi gems is exactly the same as 20hit food and 4 10agi gems. (Although being really really nitpicky, crimson spinels are a lot more in demand and 5hit/5agi allows you to nab yellow sockets)</div>

Which gives +20 hit rating an AP equivalence of ~35.5 and +20 agility an equivalence of 57.32. That's a massive difference, and relies on you not being hit capped from gear (which isn't that hard really).<br>
<br>
Also, read the thread about +hit linked in the first post if you're confused as to why hit isn't that amazing. It's a bit long, but it basically says that hit isn't that great for non-finisher-specials (a miss only costs you 8 energy no matter what you do). I'd still say its worth being hit capped though, just because misses are such a pain in the arse.</div>

As much hit as you can get without going over the cap should be ideal, although you shouldn't specifically sacrifice other stats for it. Mostly, items which also happen to have hit on them from good itemization should be sufficient.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">The new Idol seems pretty insane.<br>

The procrate is 85% according to the Wowhead spell description.<br>

The idol basically increases your agility by 65 each time your mangle ability hits.<br>

With Blessing of Kings and Survival of the Fittest, it's close to 74 agility.<br>
<br>
That's close to 3% crit chance, 5% dodge chance and 80 cat attack power.<br>

My question is: how much gear do you need for this to become effectively better than the +88 to shred idol?<br>

</div>Pretty much, except that the 60 ap and 2.26% crit applies to all attacks, including white attacks, effectively meaning that it is 488 ap applied to 35% of your damage vs. 60 ap/2.26% crit applied to 70% (considering rip/mangle generally equate to about 30% of your damage and the idol would not be applying to them in an ideal rotation).  So, without further mathcraft, you can basically safely assume the Everbloom comes out on top.  Someone feel free to prove me wrong, as I would rather do higher dps than be right here.</div>

For example:<br>

/use (item:22829)<br>

One of the changes I like the most so far is to simply be able, when in one form, to click on another form in our "form bar" and switch immediatly to that form. The part I don't like is that you can't do it from flight form unless you are "on the ground". I wish I could do that whenever I want, or at least get a /console command to force that behaviour. For example when a kaliri comes after me, I like to start shifting to cat when I'm not yet on the ground, to start getting energy ticks since I don't really care about the fall damage anyway (especially in cat form). And this also means a "rawr bomb" requires 2 clicks instead of 1 if not macroed.</div>

</div>However i deshifted by using /cast bear form command. So i guess if i use /cast rejuvenation it behaves the same. <br>

As for potions, using a potion will not deshift you. So you need to have /cancelform command in the macro imo.</div>

</div>I realise this isn't technically feral, however last night in Treeform, when decursing someone, if a curse was present then I'd shift back to caster form and remove the curse.  If there was no curse to dispell, I'd stay in treeform and get the "Nothing to dispel" message.<br>
<br>
This would suggest that the auto-deshift is indeed contingent on the spell being castable, but I don't know if it's the same for all reasons for something being castable - in other words if you'll de-shift when stunned but won't if the spell is on cooldown etc.</div>

</div>Yes, deshifting is contingent on the spell/action being usable when you click it, if you can't cast the spell(stunned/silenced) you won't deshift.  Auto-deshifting does not happen for healthstones/mana potions/health potions etc.  I haven't tested everything but it seems to be pretty much all "items" need a /cancelform macro and all spells will activate it automatically if the spell is castable.  Basically there are only two reasons to use a /cancelform macro: 1. Reshifting - shifting from the same from to the same form to remove a snare/root or for an energy/rage boost from Furor; 2. Item Use - potions, stones, herbalism items, anything that is not a spell and does not activate the GCD will likely require a macro to deshift, use the item and shift back into the desired form.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I believe you should be able to reduce the macro length by subbing in an item code instead of name?<br>
<br>
For example:<br>
<br>
#showtooltip <br>
/cancelform [stance:1] <br>
/use [nostance] (item:22829)<br>
/use [nostance] Master Healthstone <br>
/cast [nostance] Dire Bear Form <br>
/stopmacro [nostance] <br>
/cancelform [stance:3] <br>
/use (item:22829)<br>
/use Master Healthstone <br>
/cast Cat Form<br>
<br>
Won't be able to test this for a couple of days myself though so take this with a grain of salt.</div>

</div><br>
Why are you making the macro so hard and confusing? It's simple as it gets:<br>
<br>
/cancelform<br>
/use Master Healthstone<br>
/use Healing Potion<br>
/cast Dire Bear Form <br>
<br>
or for cat<br>
<br>
/cancelform<br>
/use Master Healthstone<br>
/use Healing Potion<br>
/cast Cat Form<br>
<br>
<br>
Those macros work perfectly fine, assuming you haven't activated the GCD.</div>

</div>I tried using this idol along with the ashtongue exalted trinket on this weeks Gorefiend (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304235158/http://wowwebstats.com/oosw13k2uoqx3?s=14053-14295" target="_blank">WWS</a>) and changing my rotation to mangle first rip second, with a focus on keeping the mangle debuff up. My rotations weren't all perfect however it was an overall dps loss from pre 2.3 so I beleive using the shred idol and bloodlust brooch along with normal rotations will be better next week. The mangle first approach does however seem, on paper, to scale better with high enough crit rates that ensure &lt;12 second cycles.</div>

</div>The shred idol is 500ap? The one that adds 4dmg to periodic shred ticks? Or there's another one? Wondering cause I have that but it sure didn't look really good when I tested it, but it was mainly random tests.

</div>You have a bit of confusion in there. Shred is a direct damage, has no periodic ticks, and Everbloom idol adds 88 to that direct damage.<br>
<br>
The other one is Rip, and the idol affecting it as you wrote (and yes, it's not that great), is the Idol of Feral Shadows.</div>

My gear is way crappier than yours so Toskks' dynamic cat list might be off, but Grimgrin &lt;&lt; T4 helm.  Other than tier helms, the only clear upgrades would be the engineering (BoP), S3 arena and Cursed Vision. <br>
<br>
For those who can't get a tier helm of any stripe, Grimgrin is a better bear alternative than most anything other than S3 arena. This was a surprise, and is based on Rawr beta 8 (gemming Delicate Ruby, Enduring Talasite and Solid Star).</div>

</div>My T6 Helm is gemmed and enchanted for Tanking. My other T6 pieces are gemmed with pure Agi in red sockets, Sta/Agi in blue and Agi/Hit in Yellow, so I can use them in both forms.<br>
<br>
At the moment since I lack T6 shoulders at time of writing (Maybe tonight..) I use T4 helm and shoulders for DPS, since using a Tank gemmed and enchanted helm is bad. Once I can wear 4 T6 without the helm, I will, provided I find an upgrade to T4 helm for DPS.</div>

#showtooltip<br>
/cancelform [stance:1]<br>
/use [nostance] Super Healing Potion<br>
/use [nostance] Master Healthstone<br>

/use Super Healing Potion<br>
/use Master Healthstone<br>
/cast Cat Form<br>
<br>
However, when it has two /use items in a row like that, that don’t share a cooldown, does it use both items at the same time?  If so, is there a way to make it use the Healthstone first, and ONLY use the healing potion if the HS cooldown is up?<br>
<br>
Otherwise I can see myself making one copy of this macro for the HS and one for the pot, and taking my pick.</div>

</div>I've not looked at the spreadsheet so I can't comment on the formula but I thought it was generally accepted that on bleed immune bosses continual shredding eclipsed non-powershifting FB due to the energy drain making its cost huge for marginally more damage.

		<div id="post_message_553755">Alright, few questions from my side.<br>
<br>
1) There's a lot of new items in 2.3 from ZA that give you armor penetration stats like ignore armor and not to mention even an enchant on your weapon. Is this really worth stacking? I mean does it is make a huge difference to increase feral DPS in a raid by significant  amount? Just how good is armor penetration for raiding point of view? If it that good, should we give up the T4 helm over S3? For example, most of us probably use <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=29098"><span><span class="purplename">[Stag-Helm of Malorne]</span></span></a>, but what about <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33672"><span><span class="purplename">[Vengeful Gladiator's Dragonhide Helm]</span></span></a>? <br>
<br>
2) How good is the T4 2pc set? Good enough to ignore it for the 4 pc T5 set bonus? I personally would love to have that extra shred damage. I think there's got a be a price to give up the T4 2pc set bonus at a certain point when you are hit capped and sitting at a high amount of AP/Crit, dishing out a high amount of dps. Shouldn't that be our highest priority? Having a good amount of AP/Crit along with Hit capped so we can sustain high DPS over any thing else? <br>
<br>
3) A lot of us don't have multiple sets of Tier gear, meaning we usually enchant and gem our T4/T5/T6 for tanking since it's what we do the most. How do you make the perfect DPS off-spec set that's viable for good sustained DPS? For example, my T4 shoulders are gemed and enchanted for tanking, which is why I use <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30055"><span><span class="purplename">[Shoulderpads of the Stranger]</span></span></a> for my DPS set since it offers the best stats I can get.</div>

</div>Hi Camulos,<br>
<br>
Armor Penetration is modeled to the best of our current understanding of the mechanics of Armor Mitigation. Armor Penetration effectively reduces the target's armor by x (the amount of Armor Penetration). This is converted into a mitigation percentage from the formula (from wowwiki):<br>
<br>
mitigation_percentage = (armor_value / (armor_value + 10557.5 )) * 100<br>
<br>
Individual boss armor values were gathered from postings here at EJ. The link is:<br>

</div>Hi Monstor,<br>
<br>
Armor penetration is an interesting stat.. Blizzard probably hasn't really done a lot of testing on it yet, which is why it's hard to compare Armor Penetration to other stats (it's not normalized). Here's some curious things about Armor Penetration:<br>
<br>
1).  Armor Penetration gets better the more of it you have (the lower you can drop the target's armor), until you hit zero mitigation.<br>
<br>
2).  Rip is unaffected by armor mitigation anyway, so depending on your total percentage of damage dealt by Rip, Armor Penetration can change considerably in value.<br>
<br>
Mithuata has done some excellent work at creating 'ultimate' gear lists, and I believe typically he found that Armor Penetration was great for increasing DPS, but not worth sacrificing Agility (and sometimes Strength) for.<br>
<br>
Currently, from every report and model I've seen, there is no current gear in the game that is better than 2pc. t4. Yes, for certain slots some items are closer than others, so it is important to choose which slots to keep the 2pc. t4 in, but it isn't ever going to be dropped out entirely. I've factored this against both 4pc. t5 and 2pc. and 4pc. t6.. Definitely the combination of 2pc. t4 + 2pc. t6 comes out on top, unless you happen to have a Manglebot (and I haven't even tried to do that analysis).<br>
<br>
Truthfully, there is a tradeoff (particularly with tier gear) between using it for DPS and tanking.. personally, I'm only in t4 atm.. and knowing how strong the 2pc. t4 bonus is for DPS I've enchanted and gemmed for DPS first.. t5 will be a different story.. I'll go tanking enchants and gems there definitely. Some items you can get away with enchanting/gemming for both.. for example, the Relentless Earthstorm Metagem (+12 agi/+3% crit damage) is exceptional for sustained DPS, and very good for tanking as well, although depending on your gear the +18 stam *might* be a little better still).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>The best balance of gear to have mulitple sets for tanking and DPSing comes from utilizing the combinations of 2t4 and 2t6. The basic methodology is if you're going to MT, you'll end up with T6 gemmed/enchanted for tanking. The T6 legs and gloves can double for both tanking and DPS, so there is your set bonus. The ap/crit leg enchant is only slightly better than the agi/stam one, so stick to the agi/stam. Even with 15 stam gems they can both still be good for DPS. Shoulder choices are easy, use T6 for tanking and T4 for DPS (gem/enchant accordingly). Helm and chest really depend on the alternatives you can get for each slot (one or the other should stay T4). <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32235" target="_blank">[Cursed Vision of Sargeras]</a> is your best choice, <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32252" target="_blank">[Nether Shadow Tunic]</a> second, and so on.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Alright, few questions from my side.<br>
 <br>
1) There's a lot of new items in 2.3 from ZA that give you armor penetration stats like ignore armor and not to mention even an enchant on your weapon. Is this really worth stacking? I mean does it is make a huge difference to increase feral DPS in a raid by significant amount? Just how good is armor penetration for raiding point of view? If it that good, should we give up the T4 helm over S3? For example, most of us probably use <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=29098" target="_blank">[Stag-Helm of Malorne]</a>, but what about <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33672" target="_blank">[Vengeful Gladiator's Dragonhide Helm]</a>? <br>
 <br>
2) How good is the T4 2pc set? Good enough to ignore it for the 4 pc T5 set bonus? I personally would love to have that extra shred damage. I think there's got a be a price to give up the T4 2pc set bonus at a certain point when you are hit capped and sitting at a high amount of AP/Crit, dishing out a high amount of dps. Shouldn't that be our highest priority? Having a good amount of AP/Crit along with Hit capped so we can sustain high DPS over any thing else? <br>
 <br>
3) A lot of us don't have multiple sets of Tier gear, meaning we usually enchant and gem our T4/T5/T6 for tanking since it's what we do the most. How do you make the perfect DPS off-spec set that's viable for good sustained DPS? For example, my T4 shoulders are gemed and enchanted for tanking, which is why I use <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30055" target="_blank">[Shoulderpads of the Stranger]</a> for my DPS set since it offers the best stats I can get.</div>

	</tbody></table>
</div>1) No stat is better than another in isolation except when talking about gemming.  Look at the overall piece of gear ini combination with your other gear. <br>
<br>
2) Don't break 2t4 until 4t6, and even then it's playstyle/preference-dependent.  It really is that good. <br>
 <br>
3) "How do you make the perfect DPS off-spec set that's viable for good sustained DPS?"  I don't what this means, but I'll assume it means "how do you make a DPS set with all the tank gear?"  Simple. <br>
-Hybridize T4/T5/T6 gear which has hybrid enchants (gloves, chest, pants?).  <br>
-Dedicate T4/T5 gear that doesn't have enchants (helm, shoulders, pants?).<br>
-As soon as you can, get new pieces for either tanking or DPS (T5 for tanking, offset/S3/another T4 for DPS).  <br>
-Resocket T4 for DPS as necessary.  <br>
-Get dedicated DPS items for belt/boots/bracers/rings/neck/trinket.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_554086"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Its just a cycle, you've got to get your tanking gear sorted before your DPS gear so your tier takes priority there. As you progress you can regem your T4 for DPS. At T6 its your choice but the popular opinion seems to be to make the Helm pure dps with solid sapphires. The other 4 pieces, go full agility on the ones that have sockets. +10agi is still quite nifty for tanking and makes it excellent for DPS too.<br>
<br>
If you're worried about the loss of stamina I think you'd be better sticking with 2x T4 fully gemmed/chanted for DPS along with some T6 level dps leather. You're gonna have to do your own math on which 2 slots to keep as T4. Helm is a good choice but Cursed Vision really is damn good so you may wish to change to something else. Gloves are a terrible piece (t4) so I'd avoid them. Shoulders is a good choice, probably combined with legs or help as you choose. The Gladiators S3 chest piecce is amazing which is why I'd steer clear of using that slot. So something along the lines of:<br>
<br>
Cursed Vision/T4<br>
T4 Shoulders<br>
S3 Chest<br>
T4 legs/ something else (T6 is still quite good with the stam/agi patch and a 15 stam gem) or S3 pants.<br>
Gloves are a tough one, Dextrous manipulation are still pretty good, T6 or S3 too.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_554220"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->i was exceptic also in switching some time ago from my 2t4 / 2t6 to 4t6. i ver tried both combinations before and after the patch. im using cursed vision also for dps helm. overall 4t6 was the best way to go, my dps really raised compared to using 2t4 pcs.<br>
<br>
Now with the change they did, powershifting became a lot stronger and a must if you want that extra energy. i dont want to rely on getting freebies energy ticks randomly. just get 3 points on natural shapeshifter so you dont waste too much mana and powershift just before getting an energy tick, with that /cancelform macro. it is an instant 40 energy +tick you get 60 . so you can squeeze a mangle then a shred or even put that finish move in there.<br>
<br>
before the patch i was doing in full dps gear around 800dps, now im rocking steady 1.1k dps and sometimes can get around 1.3-1.5k, depending in which group im in (bloodlusts cycle and such).<br>
<br>
i still have 2 pc t4 on the bank but im not going back to it. 4t6pc + cursed vision is the way im staying. time your powershifting, and you have all the energy you need. remember about the GCDs before hitting the macro.<br>
<br>
<br>
now to another issue. about Idol of Terror for tanking idol (cause everbloom is still by far the best for the dps), i dunno, since i got tons of badges doing ZA and heroic dailies lately, i bought it and tried on Za , kara (badge farming lolz) and heroics, it rarely proccd and wasnt very good for multi mob tanking. i still prefer using my lvl 60 blue idol from strat. way more TPS imo. i know more dodge isnt bad, but im ok with what i have for dodge and armor atm, dont need 65 more for only 10 secs. <br>

</div>I'm exactly the same as Bag atm, the Expertise change forced me out of my previous <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=29995" target="_blank">[Leggings of Murderous Intent]</a> with T4 Hat/Chest, but not a huge loss except I'm sucking for a ring slot now.<br>
<br>
As for the Gem/Enchant dilemma, I feel the need to point out that there's a large number of non-set DPS gear out there (especially Chest, Pants, and Gloves, but I suppose Gloves are irrelivant)  And outside of Arena gear, 0 non-set tanking items worth a damn.<br>
<br>
This can be taken 2 ways, you can either gem your Tiered Gear for tanking because "You are the MT of your Guild and want to max Sta" and just use a couple of the pieces for DPS set bonus's; or you can (like me, dukes, and bag seem to do) Gem for Agi everywhere (2 agi/sta in blue sockets and 2 agi/hit in yellow to activate RED) and tell healers to l2p when you die.  Believe me when I say that T4 DPS gear is good enough for tanking to get you through SSC/TE as OT/MT (I MT'd every boss except Kael/Hydross/Vashj with T4 gear)<br>
<br>
As for which "tanking" items are the least DPS loss, I believe it goes.<br>
<br>
Gloves: 15 Agi...  0 loss<br>
Chest: +15 Resil vs +6 Stats = ~30.6 AEP loss<br>
Pants: 12 Agi vs 50 AP 12 Crit = 36.3 AEP Loss<br>
Shoulders: 20 AP 15 Crit = ~45.5 AEP loss Scryer 30 AP 10 Crit = ~47 AEP Loss Aldor<br>
Helm: 34 AP 16 Hit = ~61.2 AEP loss<br>
<br>
Stam Meta vs RED = ~1.25% DPS loss (not even going to bother AEP on that)<br>
8 agi gem = 0 loss<br>
4 agi/4 hit = 4.56 AEP loss<br>
4 agi/6 sta gem = ~11.36 AEP loss<br>
12 sta gem = ~22.72 AEP loss<br>
<br>
Pertinent Socket Bonus's<br>
T4 Helm: 1Y = +4 Agi<br>
T4 Shoulders: 2B = +3 Crit<br>
T4 Chest: 1Y 1B 1R = +4 Hit<br>
<br>
T5 Helm: 1R = +6 Sta<br>
T5 Shoulders: 1Y 1B = +3 Str<br>
T5 Chest: 1Y 1B 1R = +4 Str<br>
T5 Pants: 1B = +2 Agi<br>
<br>
T6 Helm: 1B = +4 Str<br>
T6 Shoulders: 1Y 1B = +3 Str<br>
T6 Chest: 1Y 1B 1R = +4 Str<br>
T6 Gloves: 1B = +2 Str<br>
T6 Pants: 1B = +2 Str<br>
<br>
Clearly Gloves will always be the first choice, after that I'd say Pants if you're gemming 12 Sta, otherwise Chests if you take the socket bonus.<br>
<br>
<br>
Edit: <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33509" target="_blank">[Idol of Terror]</a> is amazing, but you need +hit to make it worthwhile in bear since mangle isn't spammable.  The cooldown on the idol and on mangle don't match up very well either, I go 9-15 seconds without it proccing sometimes, it's still the best Tanking idol since it's the only one that provides us any mitigation whatsoever.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>The reverse is equally true. You can design T6 for pure DPS and have slightly weaker tanking set, or design it for pure tanking and have slightly weaker DPS set. It all depends on your position in raid. We have 2 ferals that raid regularly in my guild. I have become 2nd tank and he is basically third. On bosses where a druid MT outweighs a warrior I tank. He basically never MTs bosses. So, I would recommend him to design T6 for DPS but myself for tanking.<br>
<br>
From an end-game perspective, if you plan to only use the T6 gloves and legs in a DPS set, that's only 2 gems worth of difference (and possibly leg enchant). You can gem/enchant the rest of your T6 any way you want for tanking. The DPS difference is marginal, but the tanking difference could be more readily noticed. I won't argue the difference of using agi gems, I can see both sides. However, without the defense enchants on helm/shoulders it can be tricky to reach the crit reduction cap.<br>
<br>
While T4 dps can be "good enough" for tanking, T4 tanking also can be "good enough" for dps.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Equip: Your attacks ignore 315 of your opponent's armor. <br>
<br>
<br>
I''ve stripped out the stats that don't affect DPS. <br>
<br>
All the usual stuff apply (talents kings etc...).<br>
<br>
First we convert the strength to AP. (42x2x1.1x1.03x1.1)= ~105 AP.<br>
For crit rating = 42/22.1 =  Stick that back in the S2 mace and we get: 1.9%.<br>
1.1% hit<br>
1.9% crit<br>
1115 AP.<br>
<br>
Lets convert the agility on the ZA staff to crit rating and AP. <br>
AP (49x1x1.1x1.03x1.1) = ~61. <br>
For crit: (31.57 agi = 22.1 crit rating i think. (56/31.57 = ~1.8% crit). <br>
So <br>
1.6% crit<br>
1034 AP<br>
315 ArPen<br>
<br>
So it comes down to how you rank Armour Penetration. I don't know how you'd even start to rank this as a stat as it changes vs the boss up to a point which makes it tough to model.<br>
<br>
But the difference is roughly:<br>
0.1% crit, 1.1% hit, 81 ap trade off for the 315 armour penetration. As said its tough to model but It does get better the more you stack it to a point. If thats your only armour pen item I'd be tempted to say the S2 maul was better unless you were hit capped.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

But yeah with the massive redoing of the feral PvP gear it becomes insanely good for PvE (and arguably worse for PvP...). The helm is second only to Cursed Vision I believe and the Chest is nearly on par with the T6 quality chest pieces. Basically it makes it so that druids can have essentially T6 PvE gear even if they are just starting Kara, whereas the other classes at least need to deal with the fact that most of their PvP gear is not as good as PvE gear.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_554675"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Armor penetration scales really well with overall DPS, but that also means that it's not as good at the Kara level as it is at the endgame level (especially since you probably don't get as many buffs in Karazahn).  Which means it's probably an upgrade, but it isn't really a T6 upgrade until you get full raid buffs or T6 gear. <br>
<br>
At Toskk's site, I've managed to find situations where the S2 mace is both better and worse than the ZA staff.  They're probably close enough that it doesn't really matter which you use, unless your gear is really bad (use S2) or really good (use ZA).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_554680"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->My thoughts on the t6 issue - I recently got 4t6 and ditched 2t4 for it, and have noticed an improvement in dps, especially on certain fights. I'm still keeping 2t4 for basic tank and spanks, or at least until I get significant WWS to analyse my personal dps -- I need a few more post-2.3 parses especially from raids I'm not leading!<br>
<br>
The "certain fights" to me covers anything where you end up away from the boss with energy filling up and rip ticking. In ZA, eagle boss or Zul'jin phase 3 spring to mind -- maybe Archimonde, though I've taken to wearing 2t5 there on the rare occasions I get to dps, for the survivability. Leo? Lurker? Gruul? It obviously depends on your tactics and playstyle, but changing to 4t6 I've noticed a general dps increase personally.<br>
<br>
Even though I am one of the guild's three tanks I gemmed my t6 for "dps", as agility and hit are awesome for tanking, and I have enough health in BT-level gear. Using dps enchants on head and shoulders is fine with a s2 piece or the shadowmoon insignia (if it ever drops). Eventually I wouldn't mind getting backup pieces to put 15sta and def enchants on, but I've still got stamina-gemmed t5 as an option should it come to that.<br>
<br>
Having one or two pieces of the pvp gear, gemmed with stamina, really helps open one's options for tank outfits. Crit immunity in resistance gear becomes a no-brainer and offtank sets for multiple-role fights are easy to piece together too. Trying to gear up a warrior alt at the moment and I wish they had the same sort of options -- but then they have more than three Karazhan tank drops, so I guess it evens out.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

But I could probably convince some people to go back into gruuls. <br>
<br>
But is the head and gloves the best pieces with S3 gear coming out. Right now Im tanking set is partly my dps set, but Im trying to seperate both because DPS is a very big issue in my guild and we take it very seriously. <br>

Currently My guild has access to all the pieces so Im trying to figure out what is the best combo I should get. Of course the head and gloves would be the easiest for me to get with it being in kara. But I could probably convince some people to go back into gruuls. <br>
<br>
But is the head and gloves the best pieces with S3 gear coming out. Right now Im tanking set is partly my dps set, but Im trying to seperate both because DPS is a very big issue in my guild and we take it very seriously. <br>
<br>
Here's My armory Page:<br>

<br>
This is what I was wearing when I last logged out and is my current DPS/farming gear. Any advice you guys can give me would be great.</div>

</div>Done and added a note at the top of the cat post that all the recommendations are summaries for a general gear setup rather than absolutes, so it's worth checking them for your own gear. I doubt many people will as people are lazy (in general).<br>
<br>
As for the wolfshead helm, yes, it's only good if you powershift every cycle (if you set the powershift every x cycles to 2, it drops to a value of ~270 from ~500).</div>

will it be more  efficient to powershift &gt;&gt; shred &gt;&gt; wait a tick &gt;&gt;mangle &gt;&gt; powershift.....rip when 4(5) CP. Seems it will be great  burst + idol of terror will be working as  +permanent 65 agi.<br>
<br>
You are speaking that powershifting every single cycle wont be efficient (lost of energy), but using that trinket after getting 0 energy you can start powershift every 2 or even single hit.<br>
<br>
That need to be tested ofc.</div>

 <br>
I was using your dps spreadsheet, v 2.3.0.1 and came across a couple of items. <br>
 <br>
1. Clicking the "Enchant" upgrade button will check both belt gems for an upgrade<br>
2. On the "Talents" tab, my AEP for +hit is listed as .71, but when I look for gem upgrades, in all cases it lists +8 hit as an upgrade to +8 agility gems, even if I lose +4 hit for the socket bonus.<br>
3. Setting Mangle to 0 does not affect shred dps (practically, I don't know why anyone would turn this off, but who knows)<br>
4. Cursed Vision is not available from the helmet list. <br>
 <br>
Also a question, on the "Buffed Cycles" tab, under the FB section, the "add dmg" column has my FB as hitting for 719.1 with 4358 buffed attack power. Is the "add dmg" column the actual damage or am I reading it incorrectly?<br>
 <br>
I really like the ability to save a specific dps to be able to compare gear and upgrades. The upgrade finder is also excellent because it tells you the increase in dps both unbuffed and buffed which is extremely helpful in choosing which items to invest time into getting.<br>
<br>
Edit: Disregard #4</div>

In cell C69 of tab "NextStat" (a hidden tab) it is refrencing the chance to miss box from the +1 hit calculation, cell C57 when it should be a $ cell refrence to C9. Basically the +1 crit box is taking credit for +1 hit AND +1 crit.<br>
<br>
Edit: Also in the buffed colmun of "NextStat" the box where +1 hit is calculated and the box where +1 crit is calculated should be switched, right now as you progress down the column it is +1.1 agi, +1.1 str, +1 cr, +1 hit when it should be +1.1 agi, +1.1 str, +1 hit, +1 crit.</div>

		<div id="post_message_556136">Maybe we should have a comparison of tier bonuses in the first post for tanking. Usually this is discussed only for dps, with the well-known 2t4 or 4t6 outcome. But for tanking I have seen little discussion, and the main problem I have is that so far I have used the "dps rule" also for tanking because it was hammered so often that I had difficulties to get away from 2t4 even for tanking :-)<br>
<br>
Having a look at the different tier bonuses for tanking (PvE situation) we get:<br>
- 2t4: chance to generate 10 more rage on melee attacks<br>
- 4t4: 1400 armor<br>
- 2t5: useless for ranks<br>
- 4t5: +15 (damage? threat?) per application of Lacerate<br>
- 2t6: +15% threat for Mangle<br>
- 4t6: +15% damage for Swipe<br>
<br>
Globally the 2t5 and 4t5 bonuses can be overlooked quite safely I think. The t4 bonuses are nice, 4t4 is easily measurable, 2t4 I am not sure how valuable it really is, since I am rarely in a low rage situation. Does it make such a big difference? For t6 they look nice but situational. I think it boilds down to how good 2t4 really is for tanking - otherwise the tier bonuses don't seem to be bringing much to the table for tanking. Is that right?</div>

I'm sure both of us use the same standard DPS cycle (4 pts "minimum" combo Rip =&gt; Mangle =&gt; Shred). The only thing that differ is the fact that I habitually use FFF every time I don't have energy to do anything (while he does a few FFF per boss fight).

</div>Purely by virtue of what's available to me at the moment, I'm still using 2T4 in my main tank set (Head and Chest), and whilst tanking anything significant, the extra Rage is superfluous. On trash, it's really nice, and also on threat intensive encounters like Void Reaver. But it's not something I would hang on to if I had options.<br>
<br>
As you said, 4T4 is easily quantifiable, and 3T5 is a nice inflection point to lose it (even though you don't get anything worthwhile from 2T5, the extra stats and higher base armor on T5 will cover the loss of 4T4).<br>
<br>
I wouldn't agree that tier bonuses don't bring much to the table for tanking, I think 2T6 is quite powerful for threat generation, although T5 bonuses are uniformly crap.</div>

</div>Just throwing out some ideas:<br>
<br>
Powershifting resets the energy tick timer, I'd assume it also resets the swing timer (since you're going from a 1.0s swing to whatever your melee weapon is and back.) Does anyone know for sure if this is the case?<br>
<br>
Every point of hit makes a different till you reach the hit cap. Not a 20% difference if you're &lt;1% from the cap, but it's still going to factor in. How about expertise? Dodges still count as misses in WWS iirc.<br>
<br>
Any instant-cast spells shouldn't affect the swing timer, but have you run tests without using FFF to see if it makes a difference?</div>

</div>The most important thing when trying to perform well on dps meters (which I don't condone) is to focus on the task at hand. i.e. DPS. As a druid, of any spec, you should be reasonably accustomed to adapting role depending on circumstances. But when you're trying to compete on meters you really have to be ruthless and just go all out; If xyz dies because you chose not to shift out and heal or go bear and tank that loose mob etc then that's the price you pay. When it comes down to pure numbers druids aren't that far behind other classes such as rogues/fury warriors; and if ranking well on DPS meters is your primary concern then it should be achievable - spamming mangle/shred/rip and staying in range isn't exactly rocket science.<br>
<br>
Incidentally, if you're competing with another druid in DPS be sure to take into account who's applying mangle as it makes a huge difference to energy efficiency.</div>

<br>
Between potions 'in forms'(and drums!), the increased AP, and the resurgence of Powershifting, I was expecting quite a boost to my DPS, and I was not disappointed.  On fights where I normally averaged from 1300-1400 DPS, I effortlessly muscled out 1500-1600.  A few upgrades later, through ZA/Badges, I managed this gem:<br>
<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304064921/http://www.juggernautguild.com/wws/2.3/wws-20071120-2120/arkadu.html" target="_blank">Kaz'Rogal</a><br>
<br>
Room for improvement, yes, and I'm technically off the hit-cap (Armory is bugged, so don't bother checking my gear!), but that is exactly what I was looking for, and exactly what I had calculated we were going to be capable of.  I'm very excited at the prospect of certain upgrades in the near future, and can't wait for the S3 gear to hit, as the immediate upgrades will further boost my DPS by about another 50-100DPS.</div>

		<div id="post_message_557061">I realise I should probably drudge through the last few pages of this thread and check the most recent dps spreadsheets instead of asking this but meh.. too lazy. I'm wondering if anyone has worked out precise AEP values for feral dps stats since 2.3? Reason I ask is that I still see alot of questions arising concerning the benefit of being at the hit cap, or strength vs agility, or haste vs armor penetration etc, and I it would be useful to have a concise list of stat weightings assuming standard t6 level stats (eg 4500AP, 45% crit), maybe added to the first post in this thread.<br>
<br>
Anycase it's safe to assume that agility and raw AP have increased in value relative to strength, crit rating and hit rating. Haste and Armor penetration should remain unchanged? Still, some exact numbers would be nice.</div>

		<div id="post_message_557067">Toskk's model seems up to date with all the 2.3 changes, so nothing's stopping you from plugging in your input stats to get AEP values tailored for your personal gearset. As Enh Shamans went back and forth in their thread on this, people generally seem to struggle with the concept of AEP values being accurate at certain gear points and lots of confusion/argument can rise from that. Also, calculating AEP for stuff like APen (armor penetration) will vary greatly based on how much APen you already have (the more your have, the more valuable additional APen becomes, until the target hits 0 armor). You can have separate AEP sets for "Kara geared", "mid SSC/TK" and "MH/BT+" levels, but imo it's far more effective using one's own AEP values (the sims aren't hard to use).</div>

</div>Here's how tanking/DPS tier gear works.<br>
<br>
You have five pieces of tier. Two of those will ALWAYS be Tier 4 for your DPS set (well, until sunwell). With Tier 6, you want at least two pieces available to go kittymewmewmew with, so you don't gimp your own DPS by wearing gear with tanking gems/enchants on it in place of DPS enchants. So what to do? Well, there's two pieces that you can put similar gems/enchants and get the same effect in DPS and tanking gear. Gloves with 15 agi are the best for tanking/dps, as well as a chest with +6 stats. Agi/stam and Agi/hit gems are good for both tanking and DPS. If you can't get the chest for somewhat obvious reasons, helm can be made into a DPS helm without too much sacrifice. <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32409"><span><span class="bluename">[Relentless Earthstorm Diamond]</span></span></a> Provides as many stat points as <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=25896"><span><span class="bluename">[Powerful Earthstorm Diamond]</span></span></a>, and the CE helm enchant has a great level of hit on it if you're already crit capped (17 dodge rating is horrible   ).<br>
<br>
So, you wear two of Legs, Helm, Shoulders for t4, and then wear your hybrid pieces of t6.<br>
<br>
As far as your stats...<br>
<br>
Currently I reach 20k health fully raid buffed and elixir'd. I have 40% dodge without my <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33509"><span><span class="purplename">[Idol of Terror]</span></span></a> proccing, and 33k armor. You are seemingly stacking agi/stam over armor, which would indicate you're using more rogue gear in your tanking set than one should. Based on WowJutsu, you don't have your 4t4 yet, which makes me wonder what the hell you're using to break 20k health. Four piece tier 4 is unbreakable until you have 4t5 or 2t6 -- the armor makes everything. I haven't been able to get enough t5 or t6 yet to break the set, so I still wear it. <br>
<br>
And as far as your weapon choice, Staff of Primal Fury wins over S2, loses over S3. The armor pen is worth it. Don't forget that armor pen also becomes more valuable as you get more of it, until about 2100 armor pen, where clothy bosses will be brought to 0 armor.</div>

</div>Latency really isn't a good reason to not powershift now, so long as you have the macro space for a cat-&gt;cat macro.  Just be sure to hit it when you aren't locked in a GCD, as you'll get stuck in caster form.<br>
<br>
Also, why do you feel the need to EVER Regrowth someone?  Even with 2T5, you're still firing off a mostly worthless heal, that's even further gimped by your feral gear.  I suppose if you have 2 restos in the raid, you're potentially providing Swiftmend fodder, but even then, it's still going to be about 1/3 as big as the restos'.<br>
<br>
Aside from that, yeah, I've always had the rule with the healers that they need to ask me for my innervate, especially since so many now have ways to get quite a bit of mana back in short amounts of time, particularly those that would time trinkets to innervates.<br>
<br>
Nice damage too.  </div>

		<div id="post_message_557372">About powershifting vs use of mana elsewhere. <br>
<br>
I think when powershifting and using a specialized non-set dps-equipment, you would have to go for a spec that includes swiftshifting.<br>
<br>
We currently only have access to 2 out of 5 T-6 Bosses, so I use 2 t-4 Parts and some non-set gear for dps, but haven't specced into swiftshifting. As a result I have to be very careful about powershifting. On fights like Gorefiend, I will be asked to shift at least twice for Innervate and Battlerez.<br>
<br>
Powershifting in general I think is about squeezing every possible bit out of your character. Same counts for the 2xt5 instantheal. As an example: We downed Bloodboil twice and our tank setup was made up out of 2 2+T5 Druids and a Warrior. Each time Bloodboil felraged we both used that instant heal on the felraged tank and I watched it at least once have a positive impact, which might have been that little difference between life and death.<br>
<br>
Yes the amount healed is pathetic but it's logic is similar to squeezing that last bit out your Druid.<br>
<br>
I do powershift, but I use it carefully.</div>

</div>I use 2T5 in my DPs gear purely so I can fire off this "worthless" heal. Sure it only hits for 1.6k or so, but that can definately make a difference. Fights like Anetheron, HWL Najentus even rage need a fair few healers the first time you see them, and the 2T5 bonus can save a persons life and turn a 35min trash clear to a win.<br>
<br>
My guild usually runs healer light, its possible that for people who take an extra healer in their raids will have no use for this, but it definately has its uses for us on many fights =). Fights like Archimonde for example, I turn on my decurse mods and help decursing. It is not a DPS race, but that extra decurse and heal could easily make a difference between a wipe and a kill. I can recall instances where I know my heal saved the players life, it really does depend on lot on your raid make up.</div>

Also, why do you feel the need to EVER Regrowth someone?  Even with 2T5, you're still firing off a mostly worthless heal, that's even further gimped by your feral gear.  I suppose if you have 2 restos in the raid, you're potentially providing Swiftmend fodder, but even then, it's still going to be about 1/3 as big as the restos'.</div>

</div>Azgalor, Archimonde, Naj'entus, Bloodboil, and Council all give me plenty of reason to regrowth, even if it's only myself.  Sure it's not necessary all the time, I'm sure I've gone through several Azgalor and Archimonde without healing.  But after breaking Naj's shield, or Fel Rage when all 3 tanks have 8+ DoT stack and the Rage is on a Mage (worst class to get it IMO), and everyone gets AoE/Deadly/Envenom at some point on Council.  When you have something like Tranquility and Instant Regrowths (perfect for healing while running) why wouldn't you?  It may just be my instincts leftover from pre-BC resto, but many of my guild's first kills were in part due to me choosing 2k healing over 2k damage.<br>

</div>1 dmg was previously proven at always over 12 ap (varied with crit).  I think post 2.3 it's between 10-11 eap, with crit and crit at around 1.8 eap:<br>
5*10 + 21*1.8 + 28*1.8 ~= 138.2<br>

<a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28745"><span><span class="purplename">[Mithril Chain of Heroism]</span></span></a><br>
28*2.5 + 22*2.9 = 133.8<br>

Of course, that's with the "use" effect, which I only used to use for hard fights (Archimonde/Council/Illidan) but for epeen sake I started using on DPS fights.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Aside from that, yeah, I've always had the rule with the healers that they need to ask me for my innervate, especially since so many now have ways to get quite a bit of mana back in short amounts of time, particularly those that would time trinkets to innervates.</div>

</div>As of late, I've felt that Innervates going to Shadow Priests do far more good than to a healer. As you said healers haven't had many mana issues, and in 2.3 many of them got even more longevity than before (updated Intensity/Meditation, Water Shield for Shamans). Whereas the Shadow Priest can use the Innervate to increase mana regen for their entire party.<br>
<br>
edit: Re: Brooch of Deftness for DPS. I wouldn't. However, I have made it a mainstay in my tanking set (don't need the defense on Juggernaut) and it's a very solid boost in threat. My "miss" section has shrunk considerably since the patch.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Here's how tanking/DPS tier gear works.<br>
<br>
You have five pieces of tier. Two of those will ALWAYS be Tier 4 for your DPS set (well, until sunwell). With Tier 6, you want at least two pieces available to go kittymewmewmew with, so you don't gimp your own DPS by wearing gear with tanking gems/enchants on it in place of DPS enchants. So what to do? Well, there's two pieces that you can put similar gems/enchants and get the same effect in DPS and tanking gear. Gloves with 15 agi are the best for tanking/dps, as well as a chest with +6 stats. Agi/stam and Agi/hit gems are good for both tanking and DPS. If you can't get the chest for somewhat obvious reasons, helm can be made into a DPS helm without too much sacrifice. <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32409"><span><span class="bluename">[Relentless Earthstorm Diamond]</span></span></a> Provides as many stat points as <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=25896"><span><span class="bluename">[Powerful Earthstorm Diamond]</span></span></a>, and the CE helm enchant has a great level of hit on it if you're already crit capped (17 dodge rating is horrible   ).<br>
<br>
So, you wear two of Legs, Helm, Shoulders for t4, and then wear your hybrid pieces of t6.<br>
<br>
As far as your stats...<br>
<br>
Currently I reach 20k health fully raid buffed and elixir'd. I have 40% dodge without my <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33509"><span><span class="purplename">[Idol of Terror]</span></span></a> proccing, and 33k armor. You are seemingly stacking agi/stam over armor, which would indicate you're using more rogue gear in your tanking set than one should. Based on WowJutsu, you don't have your 4t4 yet, which makes me wonder what the hell you're using to break 20k health. Four piece tier 4 is unbreakable until you have 4t5 or 2t6 -- the armor makes everything. I haven't been able to get enough t5 or t6 yet to break the set, so I still wear it. <br>
<br>
And as far as your weapon choice, Staff of Primal Fury wins over S2, loses over S3. The armor pen is worth it. Don't forget that armor pen also becomes more valuable as you get more of it, until about 2100 armor pen, where clothy bosses will be brought to 0 armor.</div>

</div>As always having a single list is a good start, but once you get some reasonable gear then you will find certain items moving up or down depending on your other stats.<br>
<br>
Programs like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302191101/http://druid.wikispaces.com/Rawr" target="_blank">RAWR</a> give a better view as to what specific items would be better for you but again it depends on your preferences and making sure that you have enough of the stats that you value.<br>
<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Azgalor, Archimonde, Naj'entus, Bloodboil, and Council all give me plenty of reason to regrowth, even if it's only myself.  Sure it's not necessary all the time, I'm sure I've gone through several Azgalor and Archimonde without healing.  But after breaking Naj's shield, or Fel Rage when all 3 tanks have 8+ DoT stack and the Rage is on a Mage (worst class to get it IMO), and everyone gets AoE/Deadly/Envenom at some point on Council.  When you have something like Tranquility and Instant Regrowths (perfect for healing while running) why wouldn't you?  It may just be my instincts leftover from pre-BC resto, but many of my guild's first kills were in part due to me choosing 2k healing over 2k damage.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>I don't quite agree with that notion.  Generally each role is best left to the people who excell at it.  If a healer tosses the occasional damage spell, I doubt anyone would credit that damage to what made the difference between beating the enrage timer, or wiping to it, because in reality whatever damage they did is not even worth mentioning when compared to the damage the raid did.<br>
<br>
Can that regrowth save someone, or be used very successfully?  Oh most certainly, especially on a fight like Archimonde.  I generally just keep myself alive if I get doomfired, until the ticks are down enough that it won't cause much strain on the healers.  Likewise, if melee get knocked back and one of them is doomfired, that regrowth can be the difference between the person surviving to make it back in healer range, or dying, which increases the risk of wiping to a soulcharge. <br>
<br>
That said, I don't think overusing it will be very effective.  The 2k healing vs 2k damage is an oversimplification.  It's probably more along the lines of 1.5k healing (the hot aspect will likely be wasted because anyone low enough to cause you to shift out to heal will have plenty of heals incoming) vs 3k+ damage (have to consider potential energy wasted from shifting, your cycle getting messed up/mangle dropping, etc).  While healing has a very noticable effect on any fight (when anyone's hp's drop to zero they die, obviously a very noticable effect), damage, or lack thereof, can have just as serious an impact (even on fights without enrage, eventually attrition will get the better of your raid if damage is too low).  <br>
<br>
I know that's a concept we struggled with for a long time pre-TBC.  Dps slacking can just as easily cause a wipe as healers "letting someone die", which was seen as the primary reason for wiping (nevermind the fact that people died because healers ran out of mana on a fight that lasted several minutes past what it should have).<br>
<br>
Anyway, before I ramble on too much, my point is that a smart regrowth here and there can be really helpful, but constantly shifting out to "save people" seems like it's just a complete waste of dps.  In reality, most those people you are saving are probably about to receive heals from the actual healers anyway, and if they aren't, chances are your ~1.5k regrowth won't make any difference.  It's just situations, like for example Archimonde doomfired outside of healer range, where smart use of our heals can really help (and of course tranquility is always nice, I'm a big fan of using that when the situation calls for it).</div>

</div>Was reading the whole post thinking of tranq, but you didn't forget it ^^. When I was feral I loved barskin+tranq or just tranq, it wastes a lot of dps, but if your group is low enough, even with no healing gear at all it heals for very high amounts. The only time I'd shift out other than that were during knockbacks and such, since you're going to have to run back to the mob, might as well throw an instant heal while doing so, exceptions being when you're high on energy(knockback at ~40 and it ticks right after, waste of energy to switch out since you'll come back in melee at 80-100 depending on distance) and when sprint is up.<br>
<br>
<br>
As for the list linked, I used it not long ago, I'd say you can replace quite a few pieces with heroic badge gear(not sure it was updated at 2.3 since I switched spec), but it's still a good list to find the easy to obtain items on a new druid. Once you start raiding tho, you probably need to consider set bonus(2T4) and what you're doing in the raid(pure dps/offtanking) as well as the gear stats based on the rest of your stats(capped hit, crit immune etc).</div>

You disagree then state the same thing we are saying =). Neither of us chain shift out to heal. I let the healers do the vast majority of the healing =). But if someone within range just took a massive hit then my instant regrowth + a priest shield could mean he survives the next hit instead of dying. Neither of us try to top the healing meters, or will regrowth every time. It is purely an emergency thing. I would say half of the time that I instant shift and heal him, he gets other heals within the next second. I could have gone without the heal and done a bit of extra DPS. However the other half of the time, its made a clear difference to the fight. At the beginning of Archimonde tries I would use an instant regrowth on our tank before a fear (yes he was not buff capped) justt o top him off and help out.<br>
<br>
There really are no fights I can name that I feel ensuring someone survives is better than me doing an extra 50DPS. Even if every single time I shifted the person was healed to full before my heal landed I would still be fine with this. Letting a rogue die is a FAR larger waste of DPS. The fact that every week I can say I saved at least 1 person makes it worth it. As I stated earlier, some guilds run healer light compared to others. Our healers get stressed healing all the raid damage fast enough so every little bit helps (6 on Vashj, 7 Archimonde, 6-7 Bloodboil).<br>
<br>
Of course shifting out every time someone is low would be pointless and a waste, not to mention run you oom VERY fast (I can shift and heal 6-7 times on a full raid mana bar, maybe). But its not difficult to gauge if the healers are under pressure (&lt;3 grid) and if they are, a few well timed instant heals works wonders. Like a tranquility after an AE (Hi Najentus!). We can heal, we should heal, its just practice to do it only when needed, and T5 makes it a lot easier to be a life saving kitty cat.<br>

</div>Yeah. I realized after writing that I'll have to test it tonight or tomorrow and post here. My initial expectation is that the attacks don't get delayed because the bear swings come regularly. Or else I'll be able to delay them forever with just Demo Roar spam. It's a little more likely that FFF could be bugged (I'd call it a bug.) this way though.<br>
<br>
By the way, anyone else notice that Mangle (Bear) and FFF in bear have the same 1 sec GCD that the cat abilities have, instead of 1.5 sec? I find it a little funny. And nice. ^^</div>

		<div id="post_message_560273">Couldnt find this anywhere (if anyone has a link to my question and Im just a blind ol' druid) but after playing around in RAWR today trying to figure out bear mitigation and a whole bunch of other crap. I had to ask myself where does the +hit come into play. Ive been filing through hundreds of perfect druid builds and future item needs. But it seems to be lacking on the +hit.<br>
<br>
There is nothing more frustrating then running up to a mob, getting ready to mangle and your mangle is misse/dodged/parried. I get so frusted, and Ive been on a mission now to try and increase my +hit rating in bear but. But alas I keep coming up empty handed. Are there any suggestions you guys can give me. I know mangle is one of the key threat generators in bear form. If I cant land mangle it makes tanking on bloodboil extremely hard, especially if im trying to pull it off the MT who has 7 debuffs.</div>

		<div id="post_message_560379">Hit Rating is hard to come by on tanking gear as a Druid, though we do have a few options.<br>
<br>
1) Jewellery. If you can make up crit reduction or armor elsewhere, jewellery is not a bad place to get some Hit Rating. Especially the new <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33296"><span><span class="purplename">[Brooch of Deftness]</span></span></a> is a damn good aggro item because of the Hit Rating AND Expertise. There's also stuff like <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30099"><span><span class="purplename">[Frayed Tether of the Drowned]</span></span></a> and <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32261"><span><span class="purplename">[Band of the Abyssal Lord]</span></span></a>.<br>
<br>
2) S3 Arena gear. A bunch of pieces have a nice bit of hit rating on them, and if you wear 2 pieces, you get the 35 resilience set bonus which is a good chunk of what you need for crit immunity.<br>
<br>
3) <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30229"><span><span class="purplename">[Nordrassil Feral-Kilt]</span></span></a> and <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=31044"><span><span class="purplename">[Thunderheart Leggings]</span></span></a> both have a decent amount of hit rating.<br>
<br>
4) <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30041"><span><span class="purplename">[Boots of Natural Grace]</span></span></a> are very good if you're a leatherworker pre-BT.<br>
<br>
5) If you use a <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32409"><span><span class="bluename">[Relentless Earthstorm Diamond]</span></span></a> you should be using 2 x <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=24061"><span><span class="bluename">[Glinting Noble Topaz]</span></span></a> to make up the yellow gem requirement.<br>
<br>
6) Sacrifice mitigation, wear a bunch of Rogue items with hit rating in lieu of more bear oriented high armor items.<br>
<br>
Druid threat is already solid despite our not-as-good-as-Warrior itemization when it comes to aggro stats (by which I mean Hit Rating &amp; Expertise, not Str/Agi), which is why I guess they won't give us much Hit Rating / Expertise. Imagine if all the Intellect on our set pieces was Hit Rating and T5/6 Pants had Expertise O.O<br>
<br>
Personally, I never focussed on Hit Rating. The only Hit Rating I had for a long long time was purely incidental (on Nordrassil Kilt). Only recently did I acquire Brooch of Deftness solely for the aggro producing stats on it. And so far (5/6 ssc 3/4 tk) I've not ever had threat issues on a boss encounter that I can remember.</div>

</div>The list looks solid. <br>
<br>
In keeping the 2T5 this looks to probably be the best. <br>
The only "flaw" is that S3 chest is WAY superior to the T4 chest and Skulker's Greaves are a fair bit better than T5. For sustained DPS I think its probably worth giving up 2T5 and using the T4 Gloves/Shoulders, S3 Helm/Chest and Skulker's greaves for legs. The T5 set bonus, while nice I find is more usuable in PvP than in PvE. Its rare I'll hit a situation where I can't solve the problem with either a Healthstone or Healing Pot instead of needing to use an insta-regrowth.</div>

</div>Really? I'd be curious to see the spreadsheets which value expertise so highly. Running Toskk's sim with 3000 AP, 35% crit, 120 hit rating, 7 weapon damage, 0 expertise/APen/Haste, Everbloom Idol, Relentless and 2t4, I get the following AEP values:<br>
<br>
str 2.27<br>
agi 2.69<br>
exp 1.61<br>
<br>
Which puts Ancestral Ring of Conquest at 128.93 AEP and Shapeshifter's Signet at 99.21 AEP.</div>

</div>Like any other instance it depends on many factors, if you take down the mobs with aoe then you need to give some time to your bears to build aggro on all the mobs they are tanking. On the other side if you are doing them one by one then no need to wait and you should be able to dps the druid's target really quickly since unlike warriors druids do not change target when tanking up to 3 mobs.</div>

In case you're not already, have a mage casting blizzard.  Then if a mob tries to escape the AOE, it can be easily seen and taunted due to the snare.<br>

</div>This really isn't the right place for that sort of advice. I'd suggest you have a read of Lissanna's leveling guide, it should be enough to get you started: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304081259/http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=11601186&amp;sid=1" target="_blank">WoW Forums -&gt; Guide for Feral &amp; Balance leveling v.2.2</a><br>

		<div id="post_message_561428">Greetings everybody =) <br>
<br>
I need some advises. I'm a feral, currently at the end of ssc/tk, and i hesitate a lot concerning the use i should make of the wonderful s3 chest. <br>
<br>
As a lot of druids, my guild don't return very oftenly to maghteridon, so i don't have the T4 chest for my tank gear, and we don't kill Kael'Thas yet and i'm pretty sure that some warriors, priests and maybe other druids will get the t5 before me when it will drop. So i wear the Heavy Clefthoof Vest, with 3 x + 12 stamina gems, and +150 health enchant (that is a total of 81 stamina + 150 health). It's good for tanking, yes, but it lacks of strength/agility for threat generation and of course agility for dodge, and i'm fed up to wear this item since i started to tank normal instances. <br>
<br>
So my idea was to take the s3 chest and gem and enchant it for tanking. I have it, with +6 to all stats (that is a better enchant for tanking than +150hp, and it will help me also in arena). But i've read so many topics where the s3 chest is described as one of the best for dps that i'm hesitating a lot about the gems that i should use. And indeed, without gems on it, when i wear it, i lost "just" 37 attack power, 10 hit, but have 0.6% critic more than my Chestguard of the Conniver. <br>
<br>
Should i go for 3 x 12 stamina for a full tank and arena chest ? (54 + 36 = 90, so more than my previous one) For a mix of 2 x +12 stamina and 1 x +8 agility for an all-purpose tank oriented chest ? (78 stamina, a little bit less that mine, and + 8 agility, i don't know if gemmed like that, the chest is good for dps) For 2 x +4agi/+6stam and 1x +4agi/4hit for an hybrid chest but more dps oriented (66 stamina, 15 less that mine, +12 agi, and +4 hit + the socket bonus) or for 2 x +8agi and 1 x +4agi/4hit for a pure dps chest (54 stamina, 26 less that mine, +20agi, +4 hit, and the socket bonus) ? <br>
<br>
Even if i gem it for dps, i think that i'll use it to tank because of the armor, the high stamina in it, the resilience, and the threat generation stats (strength and agility). But i'll fall from 15,8k stam with clefthoof self-buff, to 15,3k with the s3 chest gemmed for dps, so 500 health less, that is huge. <br>
<br>
So what should i do ? Is there a good mix of gems that will make of this chest a very good one for dps, but also a clear improvement over mine for tanking, without loosing too much stamina ? <br>
<br>
I have also a Bloodsea Brigand's Vest looted recently, but not gemmed. As i see in many sites, this chest is not a clear improvement over mine for dps, but maybe it's still better than a pure tanking or hybrid gemmed s3 chest ? <br>
<br>
Thanks in advance for your advises =)</div>

</div>Never had trouble with mutliple mobs, mangle on first one, then switch to 2nd and maul/swipe(to lock 3rd/4th), switch to 3rd maul/swipe, switch to 4th mangle, switch back to main maul/swipe, then maul/demo and keep turning around with maul/swipes or mangles. More mobs need a bit of setup, and less is just easier. With 4, you might lose aggro on first if the dps starts fast, so you might want to switch back to it for a maul/swipe after 2nd then keep going. Overall I found tanking multiple mobs on a feral really easy, unless you're rage starved for some reason. It's not prot pally, but it's better than prot war.</div>

		<div id="post_message_561445">I don't have issues in more... eh... organized zones.  Hyjal just seems so chaotic,  I guess.  In zones with static pulls, at least I know which targets I need to personally build agro on.  In Hyjal it's just "Build agro on everything" and I can't seem to achieve that.  Is it maybe an issue with which tank should be agroing which targets?<br>

Before anyone says it, no, I'm not trying to shift blame off myself.  I'm just trying to figure out if there is an easier way to determine what I should be tanking, and what the other tanks should.</div>

I was having a few aggro issues with AoE'rs eventually pulling mobs off me on MH trash waves, I've switched to a slightly less defensive gear setup and it's a lot better now. KTM usually clocks me at 1200 ish TPS, with peaks of 1400-1500. Drop a little armor, don't be too worried about losing crit immunity and boost AP/Crit rate. Just mangle-swipe-swipe-swipe, with mauls in between if you have plenty of rage, and tabdance a bit so the mangles land on different mobs. Make sure you have a BoM (I ask pallies to overwrite the GBoW on druids with a personal BoM and keep it up). <br>
<br>
Btw, thorns seem to help quite a bit, although I read on many sources that "reflected" damage deals no threat - is that true? did a quick search but couldn't find anything decisive.</div>

		<div id="post_message_561452">Your tanks should split up the huge group into small ones, 3-4 mobs per tank. Its alot less choatic and way easyier to built threat on your mobs. Soon as all the tanks think they are ready, you converge in the middle and start the AoE. For myself, I spam swipe, keep maul up and do a mangle rotation on mobs that I tank, I dont bother with lacerate cause it doesnt worth it, unless you keep 5 stack on all the mobs you have. Also gear wise, I think you need more hit/expertise.<br>

Hoping that will help you.</div>

		<div id="post_message_561482">There isn't really a problem with AOE eventually pulling aggro from the tanks on Hyjal trash. Just as long as they only pull one or two at a time. Happens to us all the time and it's rarely a problem. We just feral charge lock the guilty mob to give the AOEr a chance to run and then taunt+mangle it back into position. The main thing we may do differently is that we use 4 tanks (2 warrior, 2 feral) on all the trash. With fewer tanks, I find that you have too many people double tanking abominations (chain knockdowns are bad) and unable to chase down loose mobs. It's not like we lose any notable DPS at boss time either, since only Kaz'Rogal lacks offtanking chores for the second warrior to handle and the druids just gear swap for good dps.<br>
<br>
Another thing worth saying is that warriors are best at tanking banshees and necromancers (spell reflect, but any rogue or dps warrior can handle a necromancer) and druids are better with ghouls and crypt fiends. Abominations should be split up as much as possible between players. If you go with that kind of strategy, I find myself rarely trying to tank more than 3 mobs at once, which is really pretty easy.</div>

</div>This forum doesn't look too kindly on spamming for answers. As to your questions, it all depends on what you are doing most of, and what your healers are better at.<br>
<br>
If you are MTing most of the bosses you may be better with a Stam setup, if not then may be able to use full DPS gems in it.<br>
<br>
Personally I normally use hybrid gems where I can but have recently picked up the s3 helm and chest and decided to dedicate them to DPS.<br>
<br>
Have a look at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304081259/http://druid.wikispaces.com/Rawr" target="_blank">The Druid Wiki � Rawr</a> and see what you can do with your gear. Either way the S3 chest should be an upgrade to your overall mitigation.</div>

		<div id="post_message_561510">There's nothing really specific to be said about holding agro on multiple mobs in Hyjal.  The best suggestion I could make is using a paladin tank, which is probably not a very helpful suggestion.  Still, paladin tanks really do trivialize tanking all the little trash (ghouls, spiders, felhunters) so the other tanks (your ferals/wars) can focus on the bigger things like aboms, necro's and banshees (spell reflect owns for the necro/banshee alpha and to keep the prot war on top of the agro list, so that when sheep breaks the necro won't go own the mage or some healer).<br>
<br>
That said, if you really want to use ferals for it, simply spamming swipe alone won't work, you'll have to tab through as well (even when only tanking 3, simply swiping isn't enough tps to stay above aoe, swiping while tabbing to mangle/maul them should be though).  I'm not sure they'd have enough rage tho, I know I struggle for rage in hyjal unless I've got a bunch of stuff on me.  Also the biggest killer of your tps will be adds getting away, having to feral charge out to taunt an add means you're not building any threat, and while you're doing that chances are good you'll lose a different one instead.  That's not to say it's not possible for druids to do it, we've done it before without prot pally, but I find it to be far more chaotic and messy whereas a prot paladin makes it so easy (the pally doesn't even need to be prot, a holy paladin with good prot gear would work just fine if your tanks are quick on picking up aboms/etc off the pally).<br>

</div>Well, this really depends so much on what you do most, and I think that's the first question you should ask yourself.  In T5, my big focus was tank gear, I rarely dps'd, so it wasn't a big concern for me.  This is what it looked like for me.<br>
<br>
Tank: Hydross, Leotheras, Karathress, Vashj, Al'ar, Void Reaver, Kael'Thas (Staff/shield in P2, Telonicus in P3, phoenixes in P4/5)<br>
Dps: Solarian, Lurker, Morogrim<br>
<br>
Pretty much, I was tanking just about the entire time, and even on morogrim I would go bear during the add phase, just tanking in kitty gear.  So really, since I was dps'ing so rarely, it was obvious for me to look at tank gear first, dps second.<br>
<br>
While that doesn't change a huge amount in T6, it's a little closer to 50/50, so when I got to T6 I started working on my dps gear a lot more.<br>
<br>
That said, S3 is basically the best dps chest (at least according to Toskk) short of 4 piece T6 (which means no 2 piece T4).  The chest is a decent upgrade for your tanking too tho, so if you find yourself tanking most of the time, you could get S3 as tanking chest and get something like <a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33329" target="_blank">Shadowtooth Trollskin Cuirass</a> as dps chest, and then once you hit T6 and probably have T5 chest change the S3 to dps chest.  <br>
<br>
If you really aren't tanking all that often, use the S3 as a dps chest, the clefthoof set is a really well itemized tank set and can last you a long time.  The extra agi is nice for dodge, but the str/agi probably won't be a massive boost in tps, and you shouldn't have problems holding agro over people in T5 gear without that extra bit of str/agi.</div>

</div>I was using the spreadsheet linked at the beginning of this thread.  Voldin's modified version of the rogue spreadsheet.  It goes and calculates relative weighting of stats based on your current gear.<br>
<br>
I suspect the proper way of calculating expertise may vary depending on how useful you consider negating the parry chance -- which only happens when you are attacking from the front.

				<div style="font-style:italic">How are you going about initially picking out targets for each tank?  Is it run in, grab what you can, then build on those targets?  Or are there certain types of mobs (say, a tank on crypt fiends, one on ghouls, and one on aboms type thing) that you assign to each tank?</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>I call out the composition of each wave as it comes, more so that I can make sure the right number get shackled and sheeped, but it also gives the tanks a heads up.  We typically run with three warriors, myself, and another bear.  On waves without Aboms, we pretty much just pick a few and it self-organizes.  We shackle all but three Aboms, and the three tanks who aren't me pick up the ones who don't get shackled.  The other bear usually grabs the rightmost, one warrior gets leftmost, and the other warrior gets whatever is left.  Sometimes there's a moment of confusion, but it gets sorted out quickly.  Once they get a hit or two on the Abom, they're usually looking for any loose mobs that I haven't grabbed.  The left-right thing was something they sorted out themselves, but it's worked wonders for us.<br>
<br>
I usually end up with 3-5 mobs, which as people above have posted, I just rotate through, making sure I land a mangle or a maul before switching targets, and swiping every GCD that's not a mangle.  Staying away from other mobs helps a lot, especially if you use nameplates, as it makes it much easier to establish a rotation.  Once you get them all mixed up with the other tanks, it's a lot harder, but debuffs are a good way to track them.<br>
<br>
Another thing I can't emphasize enough is using a hybrid set of tank and dps gear.  Nothing hits so hard that you need full tank gear, but if you're going to be holding more than one Abom, you'll want something more than just dps, since those stuns can be brutal.  A <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=29383"><span><span class="purplename">[Bloodlust Brooch]</span></span></a> that you can pop for some extra dmg on Swipe early on, combined with a defensive on use for when you get an extra Abom.  I stack a bit of hit as well,  <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32261"><span><span class="purplename">[Band of the Abyssal Lord]</span></span></a> and <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30099"><span><span class="purplename">[Frayed Tether of the Drowned]</span></span></a>.</div>

</div>This may seem contrary to my previous posts, but 2 T5 shouldn't be part of your "DPS" gear.  It exists for those 5 or so Bosses where healer mana is extremely strained and multiple things can happen at once that will result in someone dying without an instant heal.  You may think that "as a hybrid, it's my job to do what I can to make healing easier for other people"  It's not, your job is to DPS. There aren't many fights where your 2k heal are going to be dramatic.  I don't mean "saving someone's life"  I mean, "saving someone's life, 600 healer mana, and 1.5 seconds of their time"</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Hello,<br>
Im a raid leader, and we are working through hyjal.  My bears(who up until this point have been very good at tanking)  are complaining that they cant hold multitargets in hyjal after agro sets in.  Our warriors are not having much of a problem, but the bears are strugglling.  I read the first post, and did a search, but was unable to find what i was looking for.  I was wondering how other bears worked on h yjal trash, and how many mobs they were usually able to hold.  Our bears keep just begging we use a pally tank.  And while of course a pally tank would make it easier, I cant imagine there is no way for teh bears to hold threat, at least a little.   So what do you guys use for threat?</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>We don't have many threat issues in Hyjal. We usually use a prot warrior, 2 ferals, and a dps warrior in tank gear. On most waves our prot warrior goes in first for the initial agro and healers precast on him. I run in directly behind him, FFF something out of reach and charge/swip right behind the MT. The prot war tanks the necros or banshees, ferals tank abominations and/or crypt fiends, dps warrior picks up others. I can take up to 3 aboms roughly or a bunch of fiends/ghouls easily (2t4/3t5). Shackle aboms first or banshees available. Be very careful using lacerate in the beginning to let shackles hold and keep readjusting to not break shackles with swipe.<br>
<br>
We single target necros or a few banshees first. Depending on the number of aboms we might single target 1 or 2 of those as well. By this time the tanks should have enough agro on everything else to aoe the rest. There should be plenty of time per wave that you don't need to start aoe very early.</div>

		<div id="post_message_561556">This might be slight derail and probably not what you really want to hear, but I suggest you start gearing up some semi-prot paladin just for the few thrash waves in hyjal (even if you dont want some full time prot one). It just makes the whole thing way more comfortable. In the previous post, you got the tanking of the thrash from druid / warr POV pretty covered, the paladin as a backup just gives it bit of edge, cause the consecration can hold mobs in place which would otherwise run out and break the group cause tanks would need to chase it to get it back.<br>
Just try to get all the protadin drops in BT to some of your holy (ret?) paladins and after few weeks they will be easily able to help out enough with the thrash to remove that kind of problems which you mentioned and make it more comforable experience for your bear squad.<br>

</div>This is very similar to how we do it.  We don't use a paladin tank. We use 1 or 2 ferals, 1 to 3 prot warriors...depends who is online and a DPS warrior. All of the tanks other than the main tank wear some DPS, these mobs are level 70 or 71, not 73 like a boss, so you don't need full on defensive gear. Heck as enhance shaman, I sometimes out-aggro and simply end up tanking necros, banshees(they're not as easy as a necro) or a felhunter.<br>
<br>
It should become pretty clear what each tank is best at tanking for each wave so there's not much vent-clutter of who gets what. Others have given hints, but since I'm a necro killer, i don't really know who's tanking what.<br>
<br>
The dps warrior then taunts a single mob, the ranged kill that one.<br>
Depending on the wave, we have rules like, this wave ranged has to single kill 3 mobs before AOE, that wave may only be single target 2 or single target 4. So sometimes the tanks have upwards of 30seconds before AOE starts to get aggro. This number of single target kills is what works for our guild, your guild will have to figure out if this strategy can work for you or not and just how many should be single target killed per wave.<br>
<br>
Secondly when a mob does break free, don't let your paladins be a bunch of wimps... they can take several hits in full healing gear... have them taunt that mob at range and walk it back to the tanks. Ours have gotten lazy at this as we laugh at the DPS'r who pulled aggro, but while learning make sure they're helping out ... a bear who loses a mob and then has to charge it and get back to his other 3 or 4 mobs is highly likely about to lose some more of them. Your paladins are standing around in 10k-ish armor.. have them bring those mobs back to you. Heck have him standing near you the entire time, ours do.<br>
<br>
For the necros.. they're painfully easy... in the pre-azgalor packs our main tank warrior uses spell reflect and just keeps using it while building threat on other mobs. The melee go and just randomly kill whatever necro they like. The ranged sometimes help kill one or two necros depending on which wave it is.<br>
<br>
Finally the azgalor wave 6, i believe that's the one, it has way too many necros and banshees. A shaman runs way down the path and just starts dropping totems as he runs back. This kind of splits up the caster mobs a little so they don't slaughter the NPCs or your tank.<br>
<br>
I know the original poster only asked how his bear could do better threat management, but I think perhaps his raid might want to re-think about what they could be doing during the time tanks are building aggro.<br>
<br>
Good luck in Hyjal.</div>

We normally take 2 prot warriors and one feral to MH. The feral is for us really an improvement compared to a 3rd warrior. In the beginning we split up targets (you take aboms, me ghouls, etc) and now that goes automatically. I just move in, mangle/swpie, switch target, swipe/swipe and mangle if possible, swith target and swipe/mangle and then move out to see what I hooked. Normally 4 or 5 mobs. Then build some aggro, and move back into the AoE area with the mobs. Whenever a mob moves out of the AoE, just charge, taunt, and reel him back in. Gargoyles are taken care of dofferently of course, as are the necros. Sheeping is also used to a good extend, as is banishing the elementals.</div>

</div>First off, you don't even have a theoretical uptime of 85%, unless you mangle every 10 seconds. The second problem is, that while your uptime seems high, your Rip and the Mangle itself will never receive the bonus from it - (which are ~25% of you damage). The more complex DPS calculators take that into account and thus place it a notch below the shred idol.</div>

		<div id="post_message_561625">I have had the same issues that people are describing in Hyjal, it can be very difficult to hold aggro on several mobs, especially when Swipe is not an option (we use CC on some waves). Globally my role as a bear is not to hold aggro on the maximum number of mobs (we have 2 prot warriors and sometimes a pally for that), it is to pick at least one tough target (typically abo), some smaller targets if possible, taunt mobs off NPCs and pick up mobs that aggro our aoe guys.<br>
<br>
A few things that helped:<br>
- use main targets (ora2/CTraid) and pick your target early, you can a yellow-ish frame around your target so you know if somebody else has picked it too, it's useful for early distribution<br>
- have MT/assist bind marks to F1 -&gt; F7 or so and quickly mark targets<br>
- have a set of focus macro so that you can easily find your current target, previous target and focus target, it can help a lot because most of the time I "lose" my targets in the chaos. If there's a way to quickly pick whichever mobs have aggro on me that would be useful as well.</div>

You totally wrong about Rip. Thus it wont be increased agility is so good for it crit. <br>
Rip can’t be effected by crits, and it comes that whole cycle may be besides rip and 3-4 auto attacks gaining 65 agi.<br>

But I have another problem that I watched lately: most cases crit% is lower than should be (sometimes by far), even on non boss fights. And almost never higher.</div>

</div>Its not 10/14 seconds either. Its 0.85*10/14. You can't simply throw in that value * 65 * the corresponding AEP for Agi since that AEP assumes EVERYTHING benefits from Agi (including the mangles and rips).</div>

</div>You can grind numbers all you want, the Everbloom Idol will consistantly outperform the Idol of Terror, unless you have some ridiculous amount of ap contrasted with an extremely low crit rate.  The shred idol is worth ~500 ap on shred, which is ~35-40% of overall damage, 100% of the time.  The agi idol applies to ~80% of total damage, and when averaged even with supposed 85% uptime (which I also don't believe, as I mangle once every 12-14 seconds, as opposed to bear where I mangle every six), it doesn't work out to even close to the same AEP as Everbloom.  Unless you are having a lot of trouble generating CP to maintain cycles, I would really recommend sticking to everbloom for dps.  Even if Idol of Terror had a 100% chance to proc, it'd be inferior for pure dps, in my estimation.</div>

</div>Yeah, I use TinyTip to display target of mouseover'd mob.  It's not very useful for situations when you don't have a lot of visibility (tanking Hydross adds underneath him, managing large AOE packs, etc.).  It works well enough for big, but not <i>that</i> big pulls (Shattered Halls with minimal CC, etc.).<br>
<br>
I'm not in Hyjal yet, so I can't tell you if it does the job there.</div>

		<div id="post_message_562318">Hey fellas. thanks for the wealth of info. I was wondering with the recent changes for +hit to affect growl and demo roar, what would be the optimal +hit for a full tanking set and at what level of endgame.<br>
<br>
I'm a kara decked feral tank minus a gilded thorium, have all the rogue loot out of kara with +hit if I so dared to integrate. My guild is only at the kara/gruul/za level slowly introducing ourselves to SSC. I've noticed alot of unwanted growl resists in Gruuls even before 2.3 so I picked up a Waistguard of the Great Beast (+18hit) recently out of needed desperation and tossed a +4hit/agi in it with a stam so currently my +hit is sitting at a measly 22, but it is atleast better than my previous 0.<br>
<br>
Do you think that should be ok at my level of endgame? The recent patch has made me quite self-conscience about +hit. Also I was curious of how much +hit the BT/t6 level tanks were wearing. Maybe I should start being more gear flexible for different situations? I'm always in a heavy tank set unless im cat dps of course.<br>
<br>
Sorry if I missed this specific topic somewhere.</div>

		<div id="post_message_562393">I don't take thick hide in my talent build, because I sit at the armor cap as is.  However, I've found myself wanting to take it so I can sub out a bit of armor for +hit, as it can be pretty valuable.  Currently, I sit with +27 hit just from t6 legs, but I sub out belt and bracer for +hit purposes and it puts my threatgen through the roof.  However, if my guild wasn't a bunch of aggro whores with insane gear, I probably wouldn't have to make this sacrifice.  The bottom line is that hit IS valuable, but unless threat gen for you is a real problem, you're better off being a more solid tank and maybe subbing in a piece or two of +hit.</div>

</div>At your level of gear, there is only a few things you can do.<br>
<br>
Glyph of Ferocity (16 hit)<br>
Brooch of Deftness (22 hit)<br>
Waistguard of the Great Beast (18 hit)<br>
Spicy Hot Talbuk (20 hit)<br>
<br>
Along with Earthwarden, that will give you 76 hit rating and 11 Expertise before gems (~4.8% hit rating and 2.75% less dodges and parries). If <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304042107/http://www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Kel%27Thuzad&amp;n=G%C3%A9vaudan" target="_blank">this</a> is your armory (you should probably add that into your profile!), then I'd suggest about all you need is maybe to swap out Darkmoon Card: Madness for Timelapse Shard (27sta, 21 resilience is pretty nice for bear tanking if you need the crit reduction) and you'd be set for crit reduction and hit rating at your level of progression.<br>
<br>
With PVP gear, you can do a lot more. The Vengeful Gladiator's set has a lot of items with +hit on it and with a couple of those, the Vindicator's Dragonhide Bracers and a couple of druid tank rings, you can easily cap your crit reduction.<br>
<br>
At the T6 level:<br>
Pepe's Shroud of Pacification (25 hit)<br>
Thunderheart Leggings (27 hit)<br>
Pendant of Titans (20 hit and great defensive stats)<br>
Boots of Natural Grace (14 hit)<br>
Band of the Abyssal Lord (21 hit)<br>
<br>
With that, plus Glyph of Ferocity and Waistguard of the Great Beast you'd be at  141 hit rating, but no Expertise.<br>
<br>
With my current gear I'm able to sport a respectable 114 hit rating and 5 Expertise, while still being uncrittable, getting 50%+ dodge (sometimes spikes to 65%+ with Idol of Terror and Band of Tenacity going off), 19k hp, 33.5k armor and about 3000 AP in a raid situation. It also includes a Medallion of the Horde since the resilience and ability to trinket out of a stun or mind control is kind of nice. That would be 134 hit rating if I actually used the Hit food over Agi food.</div>

Finally the azgalor wave 6, i believe that's the one, it has way too many necros and banshees. A shaman runs way down the path and just starts dropping totems as he runs back. This kind of splits up the caster mobs a little so they don't slaughter the NPCs or your tank.</div>

Definitely. If your kiters are good at their jobs they can have every Tauren in the camp beating on the banished Felhunter at the end of the previous wave.<br>
<br>
Just get everyone in the raid apart from the MT behind the Felhunter/Tauren spot away from the incoming mobs. The MT pops spellreflect and as soon as the mobs cast at him runs to the raid. Taurens go in and "wtfpwn" all the mobs with stuns. Your crowd control and dpstrain can take it from there while the tanks round up any strays.</div>

</div>That's similar to the way we do this wave. On wave 5, one of the hunters kites an abom up to the taurens, and then brings it back to the raid. Sometimes we need to make them chain kill stuff, since if they kill the abom and are too far away from another mob they will reset. So we'd put a felhound near them for example.<br>
<br>
Then we slowly dps everything down and wait for the huge pack of casters to come from the next wave. Once they arrive the taurens get right in there and chain stun everything, which means we can just aoe it down :P</div>

</div>I heard from a buddy that it does work on Julianne. Thats as far as he tested it though. Seems logical it would work on other bosses if it works on that one though.</div>

</div>It basically just gives Maim a kick component that is independent of the mob's immunity to disorient. If the spell is interruptable but the mob is immune to disorient, the spell will still be interrupted when the gloves are equipped.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">It's huge but not as much as you make it seem. 3% more damage on ~45% of your crittable attacks. That's maybe 1.2% overall damage increase - an equivalent of ~20-25 agility. Also, since you no longer care about a meta gem, you don't need to "waste" gem slots for purple or orange gems.</div>

</div>True, it is equal to ~25 agility, however effectively it is equal to ~25+12 agility because of the agility already on the metagem.  Assuming equal stats and a helm with meta + normal versus 3x normal, the closest you could get without a meta is 17 agility short, minus whatever is needed in non-dps stats to make the metagem work.<br>
<br>
The ultimate reason to always* take the metagem is because of the crit % scaling involved with buffs.<br>
<br>
*unless the gear difference is really, really big</div>

</div>In general I've found that the encounters in ZA favour a warrior + druid or warrior + pally set-up.<br>
<br>
As far as druids are concerned:<br>
- trash: no special requirements, feral charge is very useful on scouts to root them<br>
- nalorakk (bear): 2 tanks required, druids are well-suited for this fight since a large hp pool helps<br>
- akil'zon (eagle): no problem for druid to tank this<br>
- halazzi (lynx): 2 tanks required, druids are good to soak the saber lash type of ability with high armor/hp<br>
- jan'alai (dragonhawk): 2 tanks required, druids do fine either on boss or on adds<br>
- malacrass: no problem for druid although interrupts would be nice on this fight, also fine to tank an add in dps gear and then move to cat<br>
- zul'jin: druids can tank him but intervene in lynx phase is useful and therefore a warrior is nice there, even though he doesn't necessarily need to be the MT</div>

</div>I really doubt Bears have "way more" avoidance than Warriors. I have 53% dodge with raid buffs, including GoA plus around 7% miss so that is 60%. An equal geared Warrior is going to be within that number, probably 3% less. That isn't what I would call having way more avoidance really.<br>
<br>
Then again, when people decide which tank to pick they usually keep the worst case scenario in mind, that is getting hit (assuming no avoidance) since you are going to get hit and you want to be good enough to take the worst possible damage. And for that, the Warrior does better.<br>
<br>
I do not mean to say Druids cannot tank the Bear because they can without problem. I was just theorizing the what ifs. Like "What if I had a Druid and Warrior tank with equal skill, equal latency, equal gear, equal &lt;blah blah&gt;...". In reality, this is bollocks. You will be hard pressed to ever be in a situation where you actually have a Druid and a Warrior tank with the exact same criteria anyway.</div>

<br>
The 'worst case' is when both bleeds are up. It would seem to me that reduced chance to have both bleeds up at the same time would be better than 10% less damage from both bleeds.

</div>My Guild's MT, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304235203/http://armory.worldofwarcraft.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Lightbringer&amp;n=Spur" target="_blank">Spur</a> has 55.4% Avoidance, and raid buffs don't help much (~3% more from Flask, Kings, and GoA)  Just about every feral I know right now is Resto for Arena, but 60% avoidance raid buffed sounds about right.  So it's going to be very close overall.  My personal preference on the Bear Boss is to first have the better geared tank handle Bear, as that's the larger damage, if both tanks are capable of handling the Bear then put the one with the better threat on Troll so DPS can go big sooner.<br>
<br>
I would say the only thing that makes any ZA boss favor a warrior over a druid is that since all but 2 Bosses only need 1 tank (Dragonhawk doesn't need 2 though I suppose you'd need to OT on Malacrass) Feral Druids are going to be more useful in catform doing DPS.</div>

For the bear I did take the Bear form at first but the bleeds are quite intense on healers in the group I run it with so we swapped in a warrior to take bleeds as they get the damage reduction of defensive stance. But often we're running 2 ferals as tanks now anyway so doesn't matter much.<br>

I had a question regarding the Spreadsheet of Voldin's. I've had it lying around for a few weeks now and during a silly boss wipe on Teron last night when the constructs refused to despawn, I had a play around with it.

You can solo tank the bear boss as well with 3 healers, but doing it with 2 is next to impossible, alternating avoidance trinkets helps a lot if you were to try.  The dragon hawk boss doesn't require any additional tank, a dps warrior smashing them works just fine for us with only 2 healers.  The only special thing to be aware of is stunning flame casters that break MC (if you use MC) and feral charging scouts.  <br>
Hex Lord is also fairly good for a druid as you can shift out during his aoe phase and tranquility, remove CoD, etc.  Same for dragonhawk during bomb phase.</div>

</div>That's absolutely correct, though I'm not sure if it's counting breaking sets or not, as I'd guess you're using T4 helm for set bonus.<br>
<br>
My showing Spur's gear was as a comparison, a warrior can gear for avoidance just as easily as druids can, Defense (1% per 20 rating + .33% Block) and they have talents for 7.4% avoidance compared to our 4%.

		<div id="post_message_566133">Hit rating:<br>
A while ago I used to have very little hit rating on my tank gear, probably only around 14 from the DPS head enchant. When we reached Leotheras, I suddenly had a very important reason for stacking hit. With the hit/expertise neck from heroic badges I was able to get up to 70hit/21expertise (100+ hit with edgewalkers and Opera trinket - more hit than my DPS gearset lol). Then I realised something, my tanking stats had barely been affected; sure, I lost a tiny bit of armour+dodge+stamina, but I still had plenty of everything I needed.<br>
I found myself rarely using my full tank gearset anymore. Trash mobs/heroics/Al'ar/Zul'Aman - stacking hit rating was awesome for all of it. <br>
Gaining such a huge amount of hit rating for such a small loss in mitigation and HP seems like a bargain.</div>

I've found the same, I didn't value hit at all as I was going through T4 and most of T5. Once I hit T6 though I was getting increasingly frustrated at what the lack of hit was costing me. For example last night I was the offtank on Bloodboil and my first three hits went Parry, Parry, Miss. Was frustrating and kind of boned me for the rest of the fight. It put the <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33296"><span><span class="purplename">[Brooch of Deftness]</span></span></a> at the top of my list for next heroic badge item, and has also made me think about <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33583"><span><span class="purplename">[Waistguard of the Great Beast]</span></span></a> instead of the pattern/s3 belt I was going to pick up. What I have done is replace the defensive helm enchant with the +hit/+ap enchant on my tanking helm.</div>

</div>Yes but it does help the survivability of the DPS in your raid. What happens if you get 4 parries/misses at the start of the fight? You get a dead healer/dps.

</div>Well i did not say to offtank in full tank gear, did i. <br>
<br>
What i say is that there are fights where you need only to survive, nothing more. So you should have gear for that. When i tank Tidalvess i wear full tank gear because survival is more important than threat. If dmg dies, he can be ressed or you can do it without him (his mistake, anyway). If you die, wipe. If you are tanking Karathress, no one is going to touch your target for around 5 minutes.<br>
<br>
So having tank gear enchanted for threat gimps you in these situations. You cannot make your "threat enchanted" tank gear more survival, but you can allways alternate pieces of your tank gear with pieces of dmg gear with expertise and hit rating to generate more threat.</div>

</div>I kind of disagree here. Where do you do dmg in your tank gear - on trash? It is not important as much as smooth survival of the tank.<br>
<br>
My opinion is that feral druid's value is not that it can do both dmg and tanking in one fight - since one of these roles will be gimped significantly. The main value is that you can change roles between fights. E.g. you need 3-4 good tanks (in terms of survivability) for Karahress, yet you need none for Leo. Feral druids let you switch pure dmg and pure tanking roles and adapt to an encounter.<br>
<br>
You could change raid setup for each boss, but i am strictly against this. We do all encounters with one setup and so far it wasnt a problem. However i heard that MH/BT might be different story - hopefuly we'll see soon.</div>

		<div id="post_message_566231">Re: Nalorakk, I don't see any specific limitations to druid tanking, insofar as I managed to tank it in very basic gear (HC set, t4 helm and gloves, t5 shoulders and belt of natural power, and the rest blue/kara/rep gear - nothing extraordinary for the level of difficulty at which ZA is supposed to be, my gear was rather entry level for this instance actually). I tanked the bear and another druid (with even worse gear) tanked the human form, so there's really nothing special to mention as far as "t4 druids" tanking it are concerned. So the bottom line is that any vaguely decently geared t4 druid can tank it, be it human or bear form, and there's little need to split hairs on such a basic, tank and spank fight <br>
<br>
As Boevis and I pointed out, though, a warrior + druid combo is preferred overall for this instance, but I've not seen anything in the encounters design that would not work with pretty much any combination of tanks. All in all ZA looks to me as being very intensive on healers requirements, much less on dps/tanks requirements, not only first fight but all fights. A badly geared tank is much more likely to die from healers not keeping up (also due to raid damage in general) than from spike/unlucky damage (as in, a bleed is a bleed no matter what your class/gear, and proper execution by the tank is going to help much more than just crossing fingers not to get a 3x crushing thrash in 1 second as in another pro-warrior encounter that shall not be named).</div>

</div>I usually tank the Hunter on Karathress, which we kill first. Meaning my threat and damage is both useful. As for Leo, I usually main tank (the only boss I usually do maintank) - during the demon phases I just dps like everyone else.<br>
Also, you shouldn't underestimate feral DPS in tank gear. With all the buffs recently, I have some very nice dps stats in tank gear (although lacking a little crit %). <br>
I have DPSed on SSC trash before while <b>completely </b>unaware that I had full tank gear on! We're the only class/spec that can do that </div>

</div>At the moment Cat DPS is sitting in a pretty good spot IMO. WF might be a bit much, especially at earlier raid content. I could see it being revised once the expansion hits to keep scaling going, but really as long as we get some decent itemization in Sunwell I think they have Cat DPS right for this expansion.</div>

</div>I agree.  Granted we don't have rogues/fury wars in full T6 with bladed of azzinoth, but right now I feel my damage is very competitive compared to rogues/fury wars, especially given the extra utility and dual purpose that a feral druid brings.<br>
<br>
I'd say my dps gear is for the most part a tiny bit worse than our rogues (mainly a few highly wanted slots like trinkets, which they obviously get before me).  On Teron, our rogues in the melee group (enhance shaman, fury warrior, 1-2 people with drums) will do about 1500-1600 dps atm.  I do 1100-1200 dps in the hunter group (Just had trueshot aura), without bloodlust/etc, and only me using drums.  Based on personal experience from when I'm in the melee group, I gain between 50-100 dps from those buffs (While we don't get windfury, +10% AP when we have such insane AP values is quite strong).  Add to that the fact that a lot of our itemization is still somewhat poor (especially when it comes to high end DPS weapons), and feral druid dps is right around where I would expect it to be, I just hope they improve our itemization some for sunwell.</div>

		<div id="post_message_567208">For T6 geared Druids, I'd suggest tanking almost all of ZA in DPS gear.  This way, for all the trash, you only need one tank.  On packs of 4 trolls, have a priest MC a Flamecaster to ease the burst damage.  With this kind of setup you have the AoE threat of a Protection Paladin while doing significantly more DPS and much much higher single target threat.  Just wildly swing your Paws around spamming Mangle, Maul, and Swipe and let your DPS classes go wild.<br>
<br>
I like wearing 2/5 T4 + 2/5 T6 + S3 Helm + 2 DPS Rings + PvP Wrist/Belt + Battlemaster and Shadowmoon Insignia.  I wear this for all the trash, the Eagle boss, and the Lynx boss.  For the other bosses, I wear my normal tanking gear (and double mounted Bears and double Beserkers).  This way, all your DPS, save maybe a crazy Destruction Warlock, can get a blessing other than Salv to further increase your raid DPS.<br>
<br>
We roll with a Resto Shaman and a Holy Paladin for healing, coupled with a Shadowpriest. I tank and we have a Fury warrior off-tank on the Saberlash-style fights.<br>
<br>
The Hexlord fight is cheesed with Dampen Magic + Shadow Resist Neck + Shadow Protection Buff.  Our last kill Dropped him within three siphons.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">As far as tanking ZA bosses, I solo tank the lynx boss with 2 healers without any problems.  The lash only hits for around 12k every 5s or so on top of his regular 3k or so hits.  You can solo tank the bear boss as well with 3 healers, but doing it with 2 is next to impossible, alternating avoidance trinkets helps a lot if you were to try.  The dragon hawk boss doesn't require any additional tank, a dps warrior smashing them works just fine for us with only 2 healers.  The only special thing to be aware of is stunning flame casters that break MC (if you use MC) and feral charging scouts.  <br>
Hex Lord is also fairly good for a druid as you can shift out during his aoe phase and tranquility, remove CoD, etc.  Same for dragonhawk during bomb phase.</div>

</div>Solo-tanking the Bear boss is nearly (if not completely) impossible with current itemization without an overly stacked group ie. three Resto Druids (or something similar), and even then, its still risky and who wants to take four Druids to ZA? :p</div>

I am not sure what you mean. <br>
<br>
But i am sure that when mob parries your attack, he gets counterattack in a form of hastened next swing. Our MT died due to this last month on Karathress where he got unlucky crushings due to parry hastening boss's attack.</div>

From a straight-up dps perspective AP should win out.  It's 88 AP in cat form, which by Toskk's methodology is quite a bit over 40 crit, (1 AP:1.55 crit with my gear) though of course that's based on raid damage w/ Rip and so overvalues AP somewhat.<br>

More burst! It is as simple as that.  You may do more damage overall with 88 ap, but <b>all</b> that matters in PvP is killing your opponent.  You don't win an Arena match based on damage done.  <br>
<br>
This is mostly why S2 Feral gear felt so gimp; going from PvE gear to S2 gear, I was losing about 8% crit (and a decent bit of hit and ap).</div>

</div>I'm currently working on adding a PvP model to my spreadsheet. It may take a while to get a decent version ready though. This will obviously vary greatly on your enemy and combat situation.<br>
<br>
Right now I have options for a 6 or 10 second burst starting with either 60 or 100 energy and mangle/shreding or just mangle. I'm not including a finisher atm since I often end up saving CP for maim. I'm not including it now, but plan to add the damage from pounce and/or maim. I also want to be able to customize enemy stats more (armor/resilience). Trying a few combinations, in all cases the AP trinket comes out ahead so far.<br>
<br>
Of course enemy classes vary, but crit isn't always the best means to improve burst damage.</div>

		<div id="post_message_568906">Wasn't sure if I should start a new thread about this or not, but since it's specific to feral druids... From what I understand, with the new instant shapeshifts it's possible to shift out of bear, use a potion, and shift back instantly - i.e., with NO chance of being hit while out of form.<br>
<br>
Last night, while tanking Morogrim, I got caught out of form. Since it of course resulted in a wipe I'm pretty much stuck not trying to pot while tanking until I get it figured out. (even if I do get it figured out, I think it's going to be frowned upon based on this one experience).<br>

<br>
Anyone have any ideas? Does Morogrim perform a stun? It occurred to me just now that if I were stunned when I tried to pot then I could shift out without being able to shift back, although then I shouldn't have been able to use the pot and HS.<br>
<br>
Anyone else run into this? I always thought the instant shapeshift was 100% safe and I have yet to hear of anyone getting caught out of form. Maybe it's just VERY rare?<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, the log that I have doesn't show any messages for me losing bear form, or gaining it.<br>
<br>
Thanks for any help you can give!</div>

</div>These seem to be the relevant lines, implying that you hit your potion/hs macro 1.063s after you hit lacerate.  Thus you were inside of a bear GCD, and couldn't shift back into bear form until it was up.  The warstomp probably occured because you hit the maul/mangle bear button which corresponds to warstomp for you in caster form.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Curious about how good the Shapeshifter's Signet is now. I was looking at my WWS and noticed that Im still using veterns band. But not quite sure if Shapeshifter's Signet is an upgrade since 2.3 changed it from Feral combat skill to expertise.<br>
<br>
Any advice?<br>
<br>
edit: im actually looking for something better to replace Veterns. Somthing with a lil more hit, just all around pretty much. I know I could get vindicators but I dont pvp much. My guild raids BT but no rings of Decetiful intent yet.<br>
<br>
My other ring is the band of eternity, working on getting that exalted. And thats a really good dps ring.</div>

</div>In general, expertise is an ok stat.  Useful for threat generation as well as doing damage.  But the exact value is, as usual, dependent on the rest of your gear.<br>

Plug your stats into <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304235208/http://druid.wikispaces.com/ToskksDPSGearMethod" target="_blank">Toskk's utility</a> and see how the ring ranks for yourself.</div>

I would say its good for dps until Intent ring drops, not so much for tanking cause my guild has had a ton of Rings drop from Supremus. I think weve had like 6 brutilizers and like 8 rings its nuts. Which in my opinion is a good ring that bridges that +hit gap missing from feral tanking gear.</div>

</div>That's the "issue" with the macro tho, when you get really low and want to use it, chances are you're on GCD so you actually have to wait a little bit before using it. Better than no potions, I guess, but still not that great.</div>

		<div id="post_message_569323">Yeh, that's pretty much the conclusion I reached after the initial euphoria wore off. Fact is, in a max threat cycle you have no free GCDs, the ideal is to fill every single one with a threat move, rage permitting. So if you get spiked low, you simply have to wait 1.5 seconds at worse before you can pot. I find that dual trinkets are more of a lifesaver than pots and healthstones have been, and because of the trepidation, I've found myself not using them at all, instead choosing to double trinket and wait for heals.</div>

		<div id="post_message_569398">Extra special and probably worth taking note (For me it's at a point I can 'feel' when it's safe to slam the bearstand macro and this is an important tidbit) is that Bear Mangle triggers a 1 second GCD instead of 1.5. Beats me if it's intended or will otherwise be fixed, though.<br>
<br>
Knowing when to go all out on threat and when to keep GCD-light is often the sign of a great tank, rather than spamming buttons mindlessly.<br>
<br>
Also, don't forget that on elemental fights (especially Illidan P2) remaining in Caster form for a second or two isn't fatal. In fact my bearstand macro is modified to pop Barkskin instead of Bearform for this particular encounter. You don't lose anything mitigation-wise by remaining in caster because elemental attacks ignore armor (other than the 4% dodge bonus from talents, I guess) and Barkskin will actually help keep you alive longer, as it's a flat 20% damage decrease vs the same amount of incoming heals. HP should not be a problem in this case, as you'd have just potted/HSed/whatever. Of course, you'd still want to get back into bearform for the higher max HP, but it's just not as hair-trigger as tanking regular mobs. :P<br>
<br>
Edit: To reiterate re: latency, it has no bearing on bearstand macros. I do it with 500+ms and it works every single time.<br>
Ludicrous server side load and event processing, on the other hand, could be a different story.</div>

		<div id="post_message_570079">I don't think there's ever been a time where I felt potting and using up a GCD to heal wasn't worth the threat tradeoff, and the 1.5 second at most before you can pot isn't such a huge delay that it all the sudden doesn't become worth it anymore (having to wait it out might kill you sometimes, sure, but you were gonna die anyway).<br>
<br>
As for trinkets vs potting, I'd rather use both.  If I see a bad spike starting I'll trinket, or if I know a spike is coming up I'll trinket, but if I'm at like 1000 health about to die, I'm gonna pot/trinket.  Pot/HS combo gives back ~5-6k health after the shift, for most bosses, that's enough for another hit, and with the high dodge, probably a few attacks.  No reason you can't combine both if you're in that much of a danger of dying.<br>
<br>
I've used the bear potting fairly often so far, hasn't killed me yet.</div>

</div>This is a good idea but macro length becomes a problem.<br>
I am no macro expert but I think it is possible to cast a macro from a macro using the <i>click</i> command and having the other macro on the right action bar.<br>
Maybe one of the more macro literate druids could help us out on this?<br>
<br>
I imagine we set a macro up to use the consumables in the order we prefer and have the macro sitting on a hidden bar which we can call via the macro listed a few pages back.<br>
<br>
Of course I may be completely off my tree about this </div>

Ctrl-C is my generic oh-shit button; on a modifier and on a key I wouldn't otherwise normally hit, and which wouldn't trigger a GCD if I really panic and hit C without the modifier, etc etc etc</div>

		<div id="post_message_571122">That's a fair point about being more vigilant with GCDs once you've established a comfortable threat lead, and something I will definitely experiment with. That macro looks really good Lorewanderer, for completeness sake, I'd add:<br>

/use 13<br>
/use 14<br>

Healthstones/Charged Focus [on the same cooldown]<br>

Nightmare Seed?<br>
Fel Blossom?<br>

</div>If you don't mind playing inventory games, you can take the first 3 lines and just make them:<br>
/use Master Healthstone.<br>
<br>
When you have multiples put the stones in descending order in your backpack and it will use the first one first. For example if you put the 2496 in the first row, first column slot and the 2288 in the first row, second column slot the game will always use the 2496 first. This frees up a few characters to include other consumables.<br>
<br>
I liked making a generic potion macro for all my forms so this is what I ended up making. I'm no macro expert but I tried to make it as concise as possible and I used the click command like cluey asked about.<br>
<br>
Health Pot in any form(except travel) and return to that form:<br>
Macro #1:<br>
#showtooltip (item:28100)<br>
/click [stance:1] MultiBarLeftButton9<br>
/use [nostance] (item:28100)<br>
/use [nostance] (item:11951)<br>

/use Major Combat Healing Potion<br>
/use Master Healthstone<br>

/cast [nostance] Dire Bear Form<br>
<br>
item:11951 = Whipper Root Tuber<br>
item:28100 = Volatile Healing Potion<br>
<br>
Macro 1 is keybound and macro 2 is on the left action bar button 9 so it is called whenever I hit my potion button in bear form and only then. I didn't know you could drop the () so I might change that when I get home.</div>

Unbuffed im at 31706 armor which is 72.61% damage redcution against a level 73 mob. 44.07% dodge and 15224 health.<br>

My question is about Slikk's Cloak of Placation <a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33593" target="_blank">Slikk's Cloak of Placation - Items - World of Warcraft</a> if I used this cloak I would be able to re-gem the meta in my T6 and I was going to put a Relentless Earthstorm, 12 agi and +3% crit damage.<br>
<br>
If I did this, I would lose 25 hit, 5 dodge, and 8 stamina. But I'd gain 1254 armor and raise my mitigation to 73.38% reduction. I would also gain the 12 agi 3% crit damage meta.<br>
<br>
Would using the Slikks cloak and changing to the Relentless Earthstorm be better than my current set up? The 5 dodge rating would pretty much be double by the meta, i would lose a bit of stamina and the big thing Im worried about is the loss of 25 hit. I dont roll with much hit on my tanking gear, im a bit too obsessed w/ agi/stam/armor. <br>
<br>
I guess the real question is would the TPS increase I would see from the Relentless Earthstorm greater than the 25 hit I would lose from Pepe's. Im only rolling with 43 hit WITH pepe's so id be losing a substantial amount from the limited hit i have. id like to know what you guys think, thanks in advance.<br>

</div>In terms of sustained threat on a boss, they are nearly equal. The hit rating has a very slight advantage, however you are gaining much better defensive stats with Slikk/RED. On 71-72s, RED would be much better threat gen. Also, if you are ever going cat form RED is quite a bit better than the hit rating from Pepe's.</div>

</div>This is an important note for the bear and lynx bosses in ZA where the tanks have to stand on top of each other.  Bear boss it's not a huge deal unless your tanks are dying a lot, but lynx attacks incredibly quickly.  We went from "oops the tank died again" to "huh did this boss used to be hard?" by having the second tank stand there and do nothing except absorb saberlash.</div>

</div>That's funny, it says you're guildless to the left - I'd get that fixed. <br>
 <br>
To actually help out, you'll be quite a long way through tier 6 before you actually start to pick up any tier gear - the first bits and pieces that you are likely to get will be the trash boots from BT which are pretty "best-in-slot", the trash cloak drop from MH, &amp; maybe the Supremus ring. The cloak which is very nice but will probably mean dropping some defense/resil from your tanking set, so may require a lot of rejigging of gear, while the ring is also very nice but has no armour on, so you may choose to pass to your prot warriors first. <br>
 <br>
Full tier 5 is good enough for a druid to tank all of tier 6 content in my opinion, so until you've got a few pieces of tier 6, this really isn't going to be an issue for you.<br>
 <br>
[e] The socket bonuses on tier 6 level stuff are actually pretty good, so I'd try to actually meet the requirements where possible.</div>

</div>Your ultimate tank set is completely subjective unlike the ultimate dps set which has only one goal.  I think I am wearing the ultimate tank set right now minus RoS neck.  I have 27.5k hp raid buffed and armor capped with a paladin (swapping out badge for another 51 stam trinket.)  Our warrior MT has a big focus on stam gems and has over 4k more hp then the MT of another Illidan farming guild on our server who sockets all avoidance and is passively uncrushable.  Anything will work really.<br>
We have top 50 wws reports for almost every boss and I never, ever, EVER lose agro (baring when people zone out and don't wait for me to actually hit the mob before they do) so I have no idea why any of you could possibly claim that's a good focus for tanking gear.  As much as I want to work the new expertise neck and badge +hit boots into my gear, it's simply not worth the loss of stam. <br>
Stam is really the only way to go if you intend on tanking things often and your goal is to not die.  If you want an ultimate hybrid set, then what's the point of even posting.</div>

You can use these 3 pieces in a DPS set fine. Since helm and shoulder enchants are not hybrid designed, they're my favoured pieces to use T4 for, and when I get my T6 helm/shoulders, I'll gem them for tanking.<br>
<br>
<br>
As far as ultimate tanking gear, it's a fairly simple list.<br>
<br>
T6, <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30042"><span><span class="purplename">[Belt of Natural Power]</span></span></a>, <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32593"><span><span class="purplename">[Treads of the Den Mother]</span></span></a>, <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=29279"><span><span class="purplename">[Violet Signet of the Great Protector]</span></span></a>, <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33593"><span><span class="purplename">[Slikk's Cloak of Placation]</span></span></a>, <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28792"><span><span class="purplename">[A'dal's Signet of Defense]</span></span></a>, <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32362"><span><span class="purplename">[Pendant of Titans]</span></span></a>, <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32658"><span><span class="bluename">[Badge of Tenacity]</span></span></a>, all fairly irreplaceable items.

		<div id="post_message_572645">The ultimate tanking feral gear question is a sad story for ferals because we don't have choices for any slot except perhaps the neck the boots and the trinkets. The discussion i think should be about gemming and enchanting those items. There are different roles in tanking (MT,OT,Max Threat). I think the 5agi 7stam gem is "the feral tanking gem" and 5agi 5hit if you really want to keep your gem bonus.</div>

</div>Just out of interest, how much dodge do you have in that set, raid buffed? I guess it's still 40%+ so not a major issue, just saying that it isn't the way that a lot of people have previously recommended. Clearly it does the job, and that huge hp pool must reduce the strain on your healers massively, but I think there are probably very few druids here who are regular MTs for their guilds in BT, hence the focus on what you call "hybrid".</div>

		<div id="post_message_572703">I have no idea what my buffed dodge is, I've never thought to even check it once I went the stam route and never looked back.  I'm sure it's around 50-55% or so.  Curiously I recently took a SS of myself with 30045 HP but I managed to have my melee stats pane open rather then defense, lol.  Really though anyone in t6 content can easily pickup a separate dps set in next to no time and having an insane amount of HP really trivializes the only two challenging bosses once you get BT on farm so it's definitely worth it.   That's not even including Idol or Terror since which I haven't even bought since brutality is more dps.</div>

		<div id="post_message_573048">Tank gear really comes down to personal preferance as what Xelo is listing doesn't apply if you prefer resilience to get crit immunity over defense which I think most feral druids do.  The Vindicator's Bracers and Belt are the best tanking items for their slot and from there the resilience needed to get crit immunity isn't very substantial which allows for a wide range of options in gear choices.  My choices are shaped by the fact that I never MT anything in BT/Hyjal (might MT Azgalor) so I choose more offensive items when possible and always gem with the RED meta.</div>

</div>I did not test it yet (i am farming ZA at least once a week since the patch, yet i got none of the armor penetration drops i want there), but i think that it is useful stat for druids.<br>
<br>
First my stats fully buffed (without enha shaman): 4000 attack power, 50% crit chance, 136 hit rating.<br>
<br>
I will get 600 armor pen (chest, belt and staff). I am currently working on the timed event to get to the ring, that would be another 125.<br>
<br>
I once calculated that on typical raid boss (including CoR, FF and sunder), CoR gives about 6% melee dmg increase. CoR is 800 armor down. So with 700 i expect about 5% damage increase. 20% dmg is from rip, so 4% dmg increase in total.<br>
<br>
According to wowwiki, armor pen stat value is expected to be 0.1. So 700 armor pen could be 70 crit rating, for example, or 70 strenght. I do not think that 70 agi could be put there as agility already is on most of the items.<br>
<br>
70 crit rating =~ 3.3% to crit, in my opinion this can not increase my dmg by more than the armor penetration but i am not able to proof it in theory.<br>
70 strenght =~ 170 attack power, will that give me 4% dmg increase? I do not think so but again i am not able to proof it in theory.<br>
<br>
<br>
I'd be glad if you check my arguments, since i did not think about them thoroughly and there might be some basic oversight from my side.</div>

		<div id="post_message_574016">Since everything in the game is within, or soon to be within my grasp, I'm playing with some ultimate builds, and would like some input.<br>
<br>
All these builds are with ALL buffs/debuffs into account (but not procs).<br>
<br>
Build #1 Stay-puff Marshmallow Bear<br>
Health: 28774<br>
Armor: 30782/72.02%<br>
Dodge+Miss:60.38%<br>
Total Mitigation: 86.81%<br>
<br>
One thing this build gets that the others don't is near full benefit from Ancestral Fortitude/Inspiration proc (the others are too close to the cap to get much/any benefit from it). WITH this proc this build becomes:<br>
<br>
Health: 28774<br>
Armor: 38478/75.00%<br>
Dodge+Miss:60.38%<br>
Total Mitigation: 88.21%<br>
<br>
Build #2 Balanced with a Stamina focus<br>
Health: 25771<br>
Armor: 36730/75%<br>
Dodge+Miss: 65.46%<br>
Total Mitigation: 89.49%<br>
<br>
Build #3 Balanced<br>
Health: 24060<br>
Armor: 36582/75%<br>
Dodge+Miss:73.13%<br>
Total Mitigation: 91.4%<br>
<br>
Build #4 Can't Touch This Beer<br>
Health: 21529<br>
Armor: 35062/74.57%<br>
Dodge+Miss:81.52%<br>
Total Mitigation: 93.39<br>
<br>
It seems a standard measure of tanks is HP, but looking at the mitigation I truly feel that #1 is just plan bad.  #2 and #3 feel the best to me, but the total mitigation on #4 is just plain sexy.<br>
<br>
One thing that makes me like #2, is that all my gems are such that if, for some reason build #1 is required, I can make it with just swapping a few pieces of gear.<br>
<br>
Your thoughts/input?<br>
<br>
Thanks!<br>
<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Extra special and probably worth taking note (For me it's at a point I can 'feel' when it's safe to slam the bearstand macro and this is an important tidbit) is that Bear Mangle triggers a 1 second GCD instead of 1.5. Beats me if it's intended or will otherwise be fixed, though.</div>

	</tbody></table>
</div>Just to clarify, this means that one could "safely" use one's HS/pot macro 0.5 seconds sooner after Mangle than any other bear ability (Swipe, Demo, Lacerate, etc.)?  (I'm thinking particularly of Tidewalker, where threat isn't too big of a deal if DPS is watching Omen, but the spike damage can be pretty brutal if multiple MT healers get graved.)<br>
<br>
That also has interesting implications for snap threat--I think I habitually used Swipe followed by Mangle when I'm trying to multitank, but using Mangle first would provide the same amount of threat on the focus 0.5s sooner.<br>
<br>
Someone also mentioned putting their trinkets in their "Bearstand" macro--personally, I'd use the trinkets before the Bearstand macro, so that the extra dodge from your trinkets helps cover you in case something goes wrong with the macro.<br>
<br>
Does anyone know of an addon to make your GCD status more visible than just the little "clock hand" on the buttons?  Could be helpful in preventing accidents with the new macro possibilities.</div>

<br>
i've been searching forums to find answers about ideal raid melee group setup. I did not find definite answer about feral druids in the "WF" group, so i'd like to know your opinion.<br>
<br>
Feral druid does not benefit from windfury, but he does benefit from the UR and strenght totem. I do not know if HotW increases the ATP gain from UR. If not, 10% of my 4200 attack power is 420, strenght totem is lets say 180, total 600 attack power. My estimation is that my gain from enha shaman would be about 100 dps. Additionaly, feral druid increases crit chance of the party by 5%. Retri pala increases dmg of the party by 2%. Additional rogue / warrior does not increase party's dmg.<br>
<br>
So, what is more? Druid's increased DPS + 5% crit, or retri pala's increased DPS + 2% extra dmg, or another warrior/rogue?<br>
<br>
My guess is that we do not have place in melee group, which saddens me a bit.</div>

</div>Well. First, being in a group with a shaman will make the biggest difference, as you will get SoE totem at least. You won't get GoA, but you can get at least a 5 minute might for another 200+ AP assuming you have more than 1 pally. <br>
 <br>
Second it's completely subjective depending on the makeup of the raid. Some don't raid with an enhancement shaman, probably a lot of people still don't raid with a ret paladin. Most of the time I'll either end up in the melee group with 1 dps warrior, 2 rogues, and a shaman (resto or enhance), or the odds and sods group if we have 2 ferals and I lose the coin toss. My dps certainly drops around 75-100 if I end up in the odds and sods group, but then I will usually be in with the hunters to boost their crit. Different strokes for different folks - if you don't have more than 1 rogue you might get to have the group above with a ret paladin as well - that would probably be about as ideal as it could get for a feral kitty in full dps mode.</div>

</div>I do, in fact, have a bit of a Lacerate spamming habit. ;)  It's resulted in occasionally not landing a maul or mangle as soon as I could when rage-capped (because I was in GCD or fumbling buttons from my Lacerate mashing)... as well as irritating hunters and mages when I reflexively charge a target I see out of CC, mangle and mashmashmash to pick it up, and then oops! it's dotted when they try to re-CC it.  The point about reducing unnecessary boss parries is also salient.  Unshift/reshift macros are just another reason to stop the spam.  <br>
<br>
I believe (from your description) that I use a similar Quartz element on my hunter to time my shot cycle, so I don't think I'd find it too intrusive.  Thanks for the tip.</div>

</div>I'm not sure if it's difficult to do or gimps his own damage some but we have an enhancement shaman that twists GoA and Windfury, and often run with Ret Pally, Enh. Shaman, Warrior x2 and a feral druid. Basically he drops Windfury then immediately drops GoA so everyone gets both buffs. It's a fair chunk of mana and 2 global cooldowns every 10seconds but as far as I know all it messes with is his shocks.<br>
<br>
0.0 Stormstrike<br>
1.5 Windfury Totem<br>
3.0 GoA<br>
4.5 Shock<br>
6-10 Autoattack<br>
<br>
Repeat. <br>
<br>
He loses 2 shocks every 30 seconds for roughly 2k damage. If GoA adds ~66dps over the rest of the group then it is a net gain. As for if a druid or another warrior/rogue would be better in the group the math isn't nearly so simple.</div>

</div>Our Enhance shaman has been doing the totem dance since the last patch and claims he has no mana problems.<br>
He does it because he's a selfish 16 y/o and wants the agility totem, at least he does drop WF now though <br>
<br>
As for which group I end up with it depends on the raid makeup and if I am tanking, off-tanking or just DPS.<br>

Quite often I will end up in the hunter group and not always with a shaman as they are rare still.<br>

</div>Energy reset works so that it ticks for 20 every 2 seconds. Since you only powershift right after you use an ability that puts you on GCD. So assuming you have zero energy left after the ability, and you shift immediately as soon as GCD is over, you'll still lose 10 energy from the tick. If you shift more slowly due to lag or reaction time, or shift when you have more than zero enegy left, you'll effectively lose more</div>

</div>Binding Rip to the use macro and turn off the item not ready warning is probably the most effecient way of doing it.<br>
<br>
In addition, with the new cancelform, i dont even know if its possible to get a WF proc at all. I haven't seen one yet since 2.3 when i do my shifting correctly (meaning no lol shifting on GCD).<br>
<br>
Or do you actually found there to be more dps if you shift out during GCD on purpose to get caster hit rather than cat hit? Because if you do get an instant swing, that does seem to be worth it</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Since everything in the game is within, or soon to be within my grasp, I'm playing with some ultimate builds, and would like some input.<br>
<br>
All these builds are with ALL buffs/debuffs into account (but not procs).<br>
<br>
Build #1 Stay-puff Marshmallow Bear<br>
Health: 28774<br>
Armor: 30782/72.02%<br>
Dodge+Miss:60.38%<br>
Total Mitigation: 86.81%<br>
<br>
One thing this build gets that the others don't is near full benefit from Ancestral Fortitude/Inspiration proc (the others are too close to the cap to get much/any benefit from it). WITH this proc this build becomes:<br>
<br>
Health: 28774<br>
Armor: 38478/75.00%<br>
Dodge+Miss:60.38%<br>
Total Mitigation: 88.21%<br>
<br>
Build #2 Balanced with a Stamina focus<br>
Health: 25771<br>
Armor: 36730/75%<br>
Dodge+Miss: 65.46%<br>
Total Mitigation: 89.49%<br>
<br>
Build #3 Balanced<br>
Health: 24060<br>
Armor: 36582/75%<br>
Dodge+Miss:73.13%<br>
Total Mitigation: 91.4%<br>
<br>
Build #4 Can't Touch This Beer<br>
Health: 21529<br>
Armor: 35062/74.57%<br>
Dodge+Miss:81.52%<br>
Total Mitigation: 93.39<br>
<br>
It seems a standard measure of tanks is HP, but looking at the mitigation I truly feel that #1 is just plan bad.  #2 and #3 feel the best to me, but the total mitigation on #4 is just plain sexy.<br>
<br>
One thing that makes me like #2, is that all my gems are such that if, for some reason build #1 is required, I can make it with just swapping a few pieces of gear.<br>
<br>
Your thoughts/input?<br>
<br>
Thanks!<br>
<br>
EDIT: made some mistakes in typing numbers, fixed now.</div>

</div>Maeltne, could you post some of the gear used in these configurations?<br>
<br>
We've been clearing BT/Hyjal for a while now -- the other day I offered to tank Teron, since our DPS is so threat capped on that fight with our warrior MT.  I usually gem pretty much everything hybridish -- most sockets get 10 agility, unless needed for the RED meta or socket bonus is decent. For the most part, everything was fine, but I just kept getting chain crushed.  I'd have long durations where I'd take no damage -- and our Druids and Priests would get lazy and let the HoTs fall off, and then I'd get crushed for 8-9K like 10 times in a row with a few dodge/misses in between.<br>
<br>
I have the same problem sometimes in ZA, I usually tank our runs, we use a Fury warrior to OT for additional DPS on most of the fights -- and some runs, I'm a god, I'll dodge/miss almost every attack.  Other runs, I'll be sitting at low HP forever as my two healers have difficulty keeping up with the chain crushes.  I was embarrassed the other day when Zul'jins Bear phase crushed me like 7 times in a row for 5.5K and we wiped -- stuff like this doesn't make sense for having max armor, decent stam, and a shit ton of avoidance. That being said, I rarely MT anything, I usually prefer to DPS/offtank.<br>
<br>
I guess stamina is the answer to this kind of problem, so I'm sorta interested in your #2 configuration.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I did not test it yet (i am farming ZA at least once a week since the patch, yet i got none of the armor penetration drops i want there), but i think that it is useful stat for druids.<br>
<br>
First my stats fully buffed (without enha shaman): 4000 attack power, 50% crit chance, 136 hit rating.<br>
<br>
I will get 600 armor pen (chest, belt and staff). I am currently working on the timed event to get to the ring, that would be another 125.<br>
<br>
I once calculated that on typical raid boss (including CoR, FF and sunder), CoR gives about 6% melee dmg increase. CoR is 800 armor down. So with 700 i expect about 5% damage increase. 20% dmg is from rip, so 4% dmg increase in total.<br>
<br>
According to wowwiki, armor pen stat value is expected to be 0.1. So 700 armor pen could be 70 crit rating, for example, or 70 strenght. I do not think that 70 agi could be put there as agility already is on most of the items.<br>
<br>
70 crit rating =~ 3.3% to crit, in my opinion this can not increase my dmg by more than the armor penetration but i am not able to proof it in theory.<br>
70 strenght =~ 170 attack power, will that give me 4% dmg increase? I do not think so but again i am not able to proof it in theory.<br>
<br>
<br>
I'd be glad if you check my arguments, since i did not think about them thoroughly and there might be some basic oversight from my side.</div>

</div>First, armor pen doesn't help bleeds.  Druids do a lot of bleed damage.  That makes armor pen weaker for us than rogues to start with, as rupture is much less ( or none ) of their damage.<br>
Second, a lot of armor pen gear is built poorly for us.  Bladeangel's, Dory's Embrace, Stormrage signet.  Crit and Hit tend to abound on these pieces, making juggling the hit cap a problem.  <br>
Third, Serrated Blades is a lot of pen and we don't have that.<br>
<br>
You don't have any real math in your post.  If you want to make real calculations, raid buffs create ~3200 armor pen on a boss mob with an average of 7000 armor.  Not including CoR.  The armor formula is well known, use it.</div>

</div>Armor Pen isn't an incredible stat for druids by any means, but if you're not farming T6 content the Season 3 PvP gear is very solid for DPS purposes.  Between that and the armor Penetration on the ZA Staff, you can aquire a pretty solid level of armor pen.<br>
<br>
With my gear, roughly 20% of my damage comes from Rip when fully raid buffed.  So while some of that isn't effected by Armor Pen. the other 80% of my damage is.  I've got math to back up my claims though, so if you want to check out for yourself, feel free to do so.<br>

		<div id="post_message_577906">You can't dismiss armor penetration as a stat simply because it applies to only a portion of your damage.  If you note in calculators that AGI tends to have a value of 2.6-2.8 AP per point.  If Armor Penetration per itemization point is worth 80% of Agility, it's worth 2.8*.8 = 2.24, which is better per itemization point than AP and approximately equal to Strength.  <br>
<br>
So if you have a conception of it "not being that good" because of it not affecting Rip damage, you're deluding yourself.  If it's 80% of being balanced with AGI, it's a great stat; if it's 80% of being balanced with haste rating, it's terrible.  So the question is where it's balanced.  And this depends on how much of it you have, what you're fighting, and what you're comparing it against.  <br>
<br>
The items which it tends to be on are usually substandard because of lack of sockets or fewer DPS itemization points on the item, rather than the stat itself.</div>

</div>TPS in bear form is a bit harder to measure due to Primal Fury. However, agility does scale the threat 2 fold. The 5 additional rage (which can vary since different ability generates different threat per rage) as well as the crit modifier of the damage source themselves.</div>

</div>Threat generation is always dependent on rage generation. It also depends on your cycle. In an infinite rage situation, and a basic mangle/3xlacerate and spamming maul cycle, agility is perhaps the worst itemized stat for pure TPS. <br>
<br>
If you want to factor in limited rage situations it becomes much more complex. An over-simplified analysis: 20 agi ~ .8% crit, 20 hit rating ~ 1.33% hit. Even assuming 1% crit ~= 1% hit (which it isn't), the hit rating wins.<br>
<br>
However, hit rating does not increase mitigation like agility does.<br>
<br>
You don't see much talk about threat generation here because druids don't really ever have an issue with threat. It's usually quite the opposite where it's better to reduce attacking after you have enough of a lead to reduce parries.</div>

</div>Lots of debuffs are "laggy" for some odd reason.  I'm sure why or how the problem comes about in Blizzards implementation, but if you change your target really fast when using some skills, the check will apply to one target and the debuff will be applied to the other blindly -- which is how the double Mangle occurs.<br>
<br>
ie. Changing targets really fast while Mangling a target will allow you to double stack Mangles.  This is reproducible although somewhat tricky.</div>

From a recent ZA clear WWS, average Maul hit: 605, average Mangle hit: 651, average Swipe hit: 191, average Lacerate hit: 28. TPS would be higher with Lacerate using this data, but I'll use Swipe as GCD filler instead, as it favors Agility (just to make a point!). Also assuming only 2 Swipes per Mangle to account for lag and/or refreshing Demo/FFF or saving GCD for Bearstand etc. This inflates the "cooldown" of Swipe to 3 seconds.<br>

9% Miss<br>
5.6% Dodge<br>
10.6% Parry<br>
30% Crit<br>

MaulTPS = (((AvgMaulHit * HitChance) + ((AvgMaulHit * 2.2) * CritChance)) + 322) / 2.5<br>
MangleTPS = (((AvgMangleHit * HitChance) + ((AvgMangleHit * 2.2) * CritChance)) * 1.3) / 6<br>
SwipeTPS = ((AvgSwipeHit * HitChance) + ((AvgSwipeHit * 2.2) * CritChance)) / 3<br>
TotalTPS: MaulTPS + MangleTPS + SwipeTPS<br>
<br>
<b>Base</b><br>
Maul TPS = 396.936 TPS<br>
Mangle TPS = 156.283 TPS<br>
Swipe TPS = 70.543 TPS<br>
Total: 623.762 TPS<br>
<br>
<b>Base +20 Agi</b> (22 Agi with Kings, so 0.88% crit)<br>
Maul TPS = 399.492 TPS<br>
Mangle TPS = 157.773 TPS<br>
Swipe TPS = 71.215 TPS<br>
Total: 628.479 TPS<br>
<br>
<b>Base +20 Hit</b> (adds 1.266% chance to hit)<br>
Maul TPS = 400.000 TPS<br>
Mangle TPS = 158.069 TPS<br>
Swipe TPS = 71.349 TPS<br>
Total: 629.417 TPS<br>
<br>
<b>Base +20 Expertise</b> (adds 2.5% chance to hit)<br>
Maul TPS = 402.986 TPS<br>
Mangle TPS = 159.810 TPS<br>
Swipe TPS = 72.134 TPS<br>
Total: 634.930 TPS<br>
<br>
So this simplified model rates Hit slightly better than Agility, even for long term threat, with Expertise being the clear winner. AEP equivalents are:<br>
<br>
Agility: 1<br>
Hit Rating: 1.199<br>
Expertise: 2.368<br>
<br>
Keeping in mind that Expertise needs to be present in chunks of 4, with any remainder being useless. I can upload the spreadsheet if anyone's interested, it's very basic and I've copied the formulas here anyway.<br>
<br>
Any flaws in logic?<br>
<br>
edit: Crap, used the crit rating conversion for Agility by mistake, fixed now. This puts Agility even further behind.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
Lets say i get heroism, and at same time i pop a Haste pot and use drums of battle, This would give me 40% attackspeed and +480 haste rating.<br>
<br>
At this point, is it worth using Tigers fury due to our fast hitting? (around 0.27 attackspeed i think it was)<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_579271"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Unless you can get ~2000 damage out of tigers fury it isn't worth it. With bloodlust, haste potion and drums of battle your attack speed should be (1 / (1+0.3+0.25+0.05)) = ~0.625 (assuming the effects are additive - if they're multiplicative it's 0.59). Tigers fury gives +40 damage for 6 seconds. Assuming best case:<br>
<br>
<br>
White hits:<br>
<br>
6/0.59  = 10.16 attacks total.<br>
<br>
10.16 * 40 = 406.4 damage gained for white hits.<br>
<br>
Shred:<br>
Assuming 4 shreds during the tigers fury (very best case, i.e. 100 energy at start, wait for tick incoming, and get an OoC proc in the middle):<br>
<br>
40*2.25*1.3 *4 = 468 damage. <br>
<br>
<b>Total damage gained from the 6 seconds of tigers fury: ~870 damage.</b><br>
<br>
Total damage done by one shred at 500 base damage: 500*2.25*1.3 *(1+(0.5*1.26)) = ~2383 with 50% crit rate. <br>
Shred = 42 energy<br>
Fury = 30 energy.<br>
2383 * (30/42) = 1702 damage.<br>
<br>
<b>Total damage gained from 30 energy worth of one shred: ~1700 damage.</b><br>
<br>
Not worth it and I can't ever see it being worth it with the current mechanics.<br>
<br>
I've changed the Illidan note round too. And no, I don't have a spreadsheet the swipe/lacerate thing, there's just the post linked at the end of that section that has some basic maths demonstrating it (see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080416142915/http://elitistjerks.com/534882-post532.html" target="_blank">this post</a>)<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

You can use it when you're running back to a boss, just before the 2nd to last energy tick. Say, Our Dear Prince, to convert some wasted energy/cooldowns to future damage. <br>

		<div id="post_message_580196"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Question about tanking gems.  I've been thinking about this for awhile.  It seems to me 8 agility would be better than 12 stamina for tanking.  For example if you had 10 gems and went with 12 stam for each thats 120 stam or approx 1500 life in bear.  If you went 8 agility that would be 80 agility or about 5.3% dodge and therefore 5.3% less chance to be hit by a crushing blow if I understand that right.  As long as your gear raid buffed could get near 20k life it seems 8 agility gems would be much better.  Thoughts?  Numbers are just estimated but you get the idea.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I'm a feral druid, currently at the end of ssc/tk and starting hyjal, and with the new stuff that i had recently (t5 chest, s3 chest, s3 helm), i'm asking myself if the 2 t4 bonus (10 rage gained occassionaly) is important for tanking. <br>
<br>
More precisely, as a lot of druids, my role is to offtank (adds in boss fights, trashs, etc) and sometimes maintank, so i have two sets, one with huge amount of armor, stamina, agility for dodge, and crit immunity against level 73 boss, and another one, for trashs, with more threat generation, with hit, expertise, more ap, etc. I've always kept the 2 t4 bonus for this high-threat tanking gear, but i really want to know now if the 4% chances of getting 10 rage is worthing the lose of stats and armor (i keep the shoulders and the gloves for the t4 bonus). I know that it's the best set bonus for dps, but we hit 2,5 times more often in cat, so i guess that the 2t4 set bonus proc a lot less in bear than in cat, but i want more precisions. <br>
<br>
Can i change my t4 gloves and shoulders for t5 ones, with no regret, and the guarantee that my tps will not decrease a lot, specially on farmed trashs or adds in boss fights, where dps usually unleash the fire too quickly, without checking omen ? <br>
<br>

		<div id="post_message_580445"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->2pc T4 has a 4% procrate. Assuming no haste, a bear attacks once every 2.5 seconds (24 attacks / minute) and uses 4 specials per 6 seconds (counting a 1.5 sec GCD, i know that Mangle somehow has a 1 sec GCD, but i'll let this surplus 0.5 second count for latency between attacks) (40 attacks / minute).<br>
<br>
A total of 65 attacks per minute, gives an expected proc-rate of 2.6 per minute (reduced by misses/parries/dodges). Is it worth it? I don't know, it really depends on what your tanking and how high the aggro-requirement is. On most stuff that hits hard enough to require a tank, you will have enough rage anyway, unless you outgear the encounter.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I just made that transition (with a weird 1T4 3 T5 and 1 T6 in between) and haven't seen any significant change (loss or gain) I wouldn't really worry about that too much. On trash waves you'll find yourself swiping a lot. T5 has the crappiest set bonuses to say the least, but the pieces for themselves are very nice upgrades, which will boost your damage and thus your threat generation, so don't be afraid to move on and let go of T4 for tanking. That will also free up T4 - pieces to socket and enchant for dps purposes because during progressing through BT/Hyjal wihtout access to all the parts 2xT4 will be the way to go for your dps gear during progression, depending on which parts you get access to you might use different pieces of T4 to gain the setbonus.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>See first graph attached. Avoidance has more effect once you get to the crushing range. (it should be for 101.2% for a 73 boss mob but its the same principle).<br>
<br>
Having said that, to get to 86.2% total avoidance is not easy, even stacking everything you can. Getting a good balance of all stats or stacking stamina will almost certainly be easier to heal overall than stacking avoidance to that point, even with the raid debuffs that you can take advantage of (insect swarm/scorpid sting is 7% extra avoidance).<br>
<br>
Edit: Just realised I didn't show the value of avoidance. See second graph for the comparison of avoidance against worth of 1% avoidance.<br>
<br>
Note that if you're on 60% dodge, 6% miss (total 66%) and you don't have insect swarm/scorpid sting while they are available in the raid, you're missing out on about 15-20% damage reduction (~2.5% per 1% avoidance at 65%, ~3.3% per 1% avoidance at 75%).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Yeah, avoidance scales in value much better than any other stat in the game that I'm aware of. Rawr does use the proper calculations including how the value of avoidance jumps up once you start avoiding crushings.<br>
<br>
I keep seeing many bear gearing questions (not counting threat questions), that can be easily answered by Rawr. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080416142915/http://druid.wikispaces.com/Rawr" target="_blank">The Druid Wiki � Rawr</a><!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_580822"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->It seems a popular request to list the gear I've used in the builds below.  I thought that rather trivial for the elitists here to figure out, but I guess not (especially since I can't rebuild one of them) :P.  Keep in mind I'm still looking for some discussion on what build you generally consider to be ideal, along with build that may be useful in specific situations.<br>

</div>The threat per tic of Lacerate is so pathetic I don't even consider "clipping" it's tics to be a concern, not to mention I have yet to find an addon that accurately tracks it's duration, not even the standard blizzard ui seems able to do it.  I just re-apply it after 2 mangles<br>
<br>
Basically what happens with Lacerate is re-applications only increase the stack (up to 5) and Tics remaining back to 5, not the 15s duration, so if you reapply with 1s remaining of the initial application, the actual duration will be 13s</div>

		<div id="post_message_581594">Maeltne, thanks for the info.  I'm currently building a max-armor stam set. Just waiting on another pair of T6 legs and some vortex to get another Belt of Natural Power (both of mine have 10 agi, and I'd prefer not to destroy those gems).  I feel much more confident already after gemming helm, chest, shoulders, and and a 2nd pair of gloves with 15 stam and full defensive enchants.  My avoidance is still relatively high and my threat is the same if not better due to being rage starved less often.  The extra HP padding is a tremendous confidence boost and, even with endgame content conquered, it makes me easier to heal and feel more like a solid tank.<br>
<br>
I'm going with your #2 Build (however I dislike the dependance on an Elixir for -crit):<br>

</div>Thanks.  I ran the math on Belt of Deep Shadow, and that is what I came up with.<br>
<br>
My gear yields values as<br>
191.8224 w/o sockets<br>
222.92 with matching sockets and socket bonus (this is the value he listed).<br>
237.16 ignoring the socket bonus and using the best blue gems<br>
<br>
That's actually dang annoying.  Now I have to recalculate all his values. :/.  Easiest to code/most user friendly would be just to ignore sockets.  Most user friendly would be to calculate considering both the socket bonus and without and listing the highest.  Most annoying would be the way it was done :/.</div>

My gear yields values as<br>

222.92 with matching sockets and socket bonus (this is the value he listed).<br>
237.16 ignoring the socket bonus and using the best blue gems<br>
 <br>
That's actually dang annoying. Now I have to recalculate all his values. :/. Easiest to code/most user friendly would be just to ignore sockets. Most user friendly would be to calculate considering both the socket bonus and without and listing the highest. Most annoying would be the way it was done :/.</div>

</div>I believe it was done that way to compensate for making gear "hybrid" compatible-- any feral who is playing a hybrid role will be socketing blue Tier pieces with agi/stam gems rather than pure agi, so his values are  more "realistic" for those pieces.  The downfall is that it doesn't evaluate items that are only useful for DPS as such.</div>

Being worth twice that of hit rating for threat is clear, but what I am wondering is how much extra damage does parry contribute to the boss over the course of a fight.  Is removing it worth giving up some dodge, or other stats?  I've starting thinking about this because of fights like Mother Shahraz. The OT's aren't even allowed to attack for fear of killing the MT, so the boost to the boss's damage must be significant?<br>
<br>
Can anyone come up with a weighting for it compared to agility, stamina, etc, based on it's mitigation-only value?  I'm not expecting it to beat agility or anything, but it should have a weighting, and I think it would be decent.</div>

		<div id="post_message_583523">The provision of overall mitigation is relatively low. A parry reduces swing speed by ~40% from where it currently is (so a 2 second attack will have, on average, a 0.4 second reduction in swing speed from a parry). This means you gain 20% damage per parry on an attack, so with a standard 12% parry from a boss, you take 12*0.2 + 100 = 102.4% of the "actual" damage you should take. This means its ~0.25% damage mitigation from 20 expertise rating, or 0.05% damage mitigation from 1 rating. Not really worth that much by itself.<br>
<br>
The main thing it does is reduce parry strings. When you get a 3-4 parries in a row it's a big increase in swing speed = a lot of burst damage, especially from bosses such as Teron. It's probably worth more than agility in a pure "healer friendly" way, and the same in threat terms. I'd value expertise over pretty much every other stat in "pure" terms. Unfortunately the items it appears on are very limited for a druid. You should certainly push to get the good pieces though (Shapeshifters signet/Brooch of Deftness are the two easy ones).<br>
<br>
Also, iirc, Shahraz was fixed to not have parry affect her swing timer.</div>

You are neglecting the fact that the Braided Eternium Chain has an aura component - you wont be the only person benefiting. 28 crit rating for 4 people... not sure how well that compares to 140 crit rating for one person, but it sure is allot easier on threat.</div>

</div>I am not all that great with WWS, however it appears that you used Mangle 30 times and used Shred 31 times which is a pretty bad combo. In a normal rotation you try to get in 3 or 4 Shred per Mangle but here it looks like you basically took turns Mangling and Shredding.<br>

The other thing is that you used Bear Mangle and Maul as well as Growl which indicates you tanked something. Obviously that and using your CR is going to lower your DPS over some Hunter/SPriest whose whole job it is to DPS in a given boss fight.</div>

Those are the only two WWS reports I have for lurker . You can see that DPS is pretty limited in general for everyone, and in those parses I'm in pretty decent gear (the first was around about our first illidan kill, the second about a month after) and I was tanking all the submerge phases (although in full DPS gear).<br>
<br>
As has been pointed out by other posters, you should be following him (running around, not underwater - helps if you have some form of runspeed on boots/metagem but you should be fine otherwise, and you can always dip underwater if you need to) to be able to shred whilst he's spouting or you're losing a significant portion of DPS - this should up your ratio of mangles : shreds which will help your DPS.<br>
<br>
Your melee hits is ~360, which is about 6 minutes of "contact" with targets as cat, over an 11 minute fight. As a direct comparison, I had ~200 and ~210 (about 4 minutes "contact") over just under 6 minutes. Some of this can be put down to knockbacks, some to running between mobs and shifting forms (when he submerges). The more contact time you have, the more DPS you will do in total. More contact time can equal a lot of extra DPS.<br>
<br>
You could be using your trinkets better too. Valor (crystalforged) was used 6 times and could have been used 10 or 11, and Lust for Battle used only 4 times and could have been 5 or 6 times. I hope you had all the relevant buffs (5 paladins so should be no problem) but you didn't have a shaman, so that'll be a significant chunk of DPS "lost". It's hard to tell anything further about buffs without having been at the fight.<br>
<br>
A lot of the variance in DPS will be just because of how the fight works. Every time you do the fight, you'll improve your timing on the abilities and be able to get more DPS out the movement (increasing contact time) without putting yourself in danger of dying. Lurker has always been a funny fight for DPS because of how it works. As Baggles has pointed out, you'd be better off comparing your DPS to other melee/other people on a fight like Morogrim because it's much more of a "pure" DPS test, as long as you aren't tanking.</div>

		<div id="post_message_586628">Hello all!<br>
<br>
I seek some thoughts regarding whether <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33832"><span><span class="purplename">[Battlemaster's  Determination]</span></span></a> or <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=34163"><span><span class="purplename">[Battlemaster's  Cruelty]</span></span></a> is more suited for catform in pvp/arenas.  My instinct is to go for the <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=34163"><span><span class="purplename">[Battlemaster's  Cruelty]</span></span></a>, in part, because more crits translates into more combo points vs an opponent.  More combo points means longer duration for maim and faster application of 5point rip, if rip is your intention.<br>
<br>
Currently in kitty pvp gear, I'm at 2905 attack power, 4.57% hit, 36.69% crit, 10,894 hp, and 323 resilience.  While 36.69% crit is decent, I go on the assumption that my opponents will have enough resilience to reduce being crit by 10%.  Assuming an opponent's  resilience will bring my crit to ~26%, I feel the extra 1.8% crit would be a nice padding.<br>
<br>
Lots of my non-druid friends are proponents of atk pwr &gt; crit in arena, but I wanted to see how other ferals in pvp/arenas see the tradeoff for these two trinkets.  I was unable to find any mention of this topic on these forums, but I missed something, please feel free to let me know!<br>
<br>
Thanks and happy holidays to all!</div>

		<div id="post_message_586787">Honestly I use the ap battlemasters.  Sayin that noone focuses you as feral is a complete lie.  Alot of 2s double dps teams upon seeing a feral druid will be dead set on blowing the crap out of you, and in 5s against 4dps or any magic 3dps team you are a more viable target to switch focus too then a warrior is.  You dont have magic reduction from defensive stance, you cant easily maneuver back behind your own line via intervene, and you dont have spell reflection, and the amount of armor you have means crap to the shatter combo ns+cl and the stream of dots on you.<br>
<br>
Its personal preference, but just know that we get more benefit from ap than from crit rating.</div>

		<div id="post_message_587076">Necklace of Trophies is a bit better, even if one is Hit capped. Haste Rating is a very dull stat for cats, white damage makes up a far less portion of our total damage output than other melee classes (especially dual wielders). As well, aside from OoC and 2T4, we don't have any major procs that would be greatly enhanced by increased attack speed (like Combat Potency or Windfury). So it's basically 71 AP &amp; 0.66% crit vs 55 AP, 1.59% haste &amp; the Stamina (assuming Kings). Crit is rather good for us. Unless you're direly in need of Stamina, I'd pick the Necklace.</div>

</div>It would be more useful in 2s and 3s.  I'm trying out a ms warrior/feral druid 2v2 combo, in which case I would be targeted more readily.  That 2v2 setup would be more about burst, un-healable damage with ms and interrupting heals with cyclone.<br>
<br>
I'm still mulling over whether to go for the <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33832"><span><span class="purplename">[Battlemaster's  Determination]</span></span></a> or <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=34163"><span><span class="purplename">[Battlemaster's  Cruelty]</span></span></a>.  The <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30620"><span><span class="purplename">[Spyglass of the Hidden Fleet]</span></span></a> would be nice, but I never saw it drop (I wanted that trinket for tanking aswell).  Using <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=24128"><span><span class="bluename">[Figurine - Nightseye Panther]</span></span></a> is somewhat curious, as I am a JCer.  The added stealth benefit is what sounds appealing in 2v2s.  I suppose the added stealth bonus would mainly be useful vs rogues.<br>

		<div id="post_message_589497">I've read the last couple of pages of this thread as well as starting from page 1 and getting to page 22. I'll read the rest over the next few days. That said, I have a question that I really hope hasn't been answered somewhere in the last 20 pages.<br>
<br>
I'm dusting off a molten core era druid of mine on another server. My goal is to gear up as best I can and attempt to rejoin some friends who have recently downed Illidan. I've been using Rawr a good bit to pick out specific gear sets ("fresh 70" and "heroic/rep" sets in particular) but I'm at a loss of how to determine cat gear to aim for. <br>
<br>
I've glanced over the spreadsheets mentioned in the OP, but they referenced feral combat skill which makes me wonder how updated they are. ToskksDPSGearMethod on the druid wiki looks promising, but it requires player stats as the input and rates the gear from there. Is there a rough outline of approximate values for AP/crit/hit/etc ratings at the various raiding tiers that I could use as a guideline? <br>
<br>
Ideally I'd like to find a way to handle the calculations and whatnot on my own to pick out the items, but if someone has already made gear lists similar to the ones I'm trying to make (fresh 70 and heroic/5man cat dps in particular), I certainly wouldn't mind seeing them.<br>
<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I've read the last couple of pages of this thread as well as starting from page 1 and getting to page 22. I'll read the rest over the next few days. That said, I have a question that I really hope hasn't been answered somewhere in the last 20 pages.<br>
<br>
I'm dusting off a molten core era druid of mine on another server. My goal is to gear up as best I can and attempt to rejoin some friends who have recently downed Illidan. I've been using Rawr a good bit to pick out specific gear sets ("fresh 70" and "heroic/rep" sets in particular) but I'm at a loss of how to determine cat gear to aim for. <br>
<br>
I've glanced over the spreadsheets mentioned in the OP, but they referenced feral combat skill which makes me wonder how updated they are. ToskksDPSGearMethod on the druid wiki looks promising, but it requires player stats as the input and rates the gear from there. Is there a rough outline of approximate values for AP/crit/hit/etc ratings at the various raiding tiers that I could use as a guideline? <br>
<br>
Ideally I'd like to find a way to handle the calculations and whatnot on my own to pick out the items, but if someone has already made gear lists similar to the ones I'm trying to make (fresh 70 and heroic/5man cat dps in particular), I certainly wouldn't mind seeing them.<br>
<br>

I linked the JC trinket because it provides AP and a decent bump of AP at demand and the +stealth is just gravy. It's something that'd be accessible to you pretty much straight away. 3Min cooldown sucks, but to be honest... most 2v2s with a MS Warrior / Feral are decided well before then from my experience.</div>

<br>
T4 geared should be a little less than midway between the two.  The first list is approximately Kara geared; and, while not apparent, assumes little to no 2.3 badge gear.<br>
<br>
The High-Gear is based on BT.<br>
<br>
Noticed your interest in a "new 70" gear list.  Use Emmerald's old gear list (while it still exists), and scan for quest and rep rewards.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304051153/http://www.gurgleblaster.net/emmerald/Cat_Sustained_DPS/Head.html" target="_blank">TBC Cat Sustained DPS Gear List</a><br>

Unless you are tagging along with your over-powered friends in heroics and Kara (and getting tons of badges), you may want to consider PVP (especially arena) for gearing up.</div>

		<div id="post_message_590435">More than the Rage cost of the skill itself, I think most Warriors balk at the requisite stance switch (DPS is typically done in Berzerker Stance, which Thunderclap cannot be used in). This requires the Warrior to actively keep on top of the skill's duration, whether it got pushed off due to debuff limits etc and then timing a Rage dump (if needed) before switching stances to use Thunderclap. Superlative DPS Warriors will do this as a matter of course, but many are lazy sods =p<br>

It really depends how far you want to take your min/maxing. To give you some perspective, using Toskk's sim with 4000AP, 40% crit, 142 Hit Rating, Everbloom Idol and no exotic stats (Expertise, APen, Haste, Weapon Dmg) gives the following AEP values:<br>

If you are in a raid guild just collect some alts. If not, try to pug it through /2 or realm forums. Whilst the prefered set pieces are Shoulders and Gloves, I personally stuck around with Helm and Gloves, simply because of what other gear I had.<br>

</div>Feral is certainly viable in arena, though not the most common. I'd recommend you find a few videos featuring Ferals (my favorite thus far has been the "Deep Feral 5" commentary) to see how it all works out in arena. After that, find a partner or two that you like and have fun with it! It's possible to get to the top tier ratings as feral.<br>
<br>
That being said, you may have an easier time finding partners as a Resto, if that's a concern.</div>

</div>Not to totally derail the topic of this thread, but I'd like to chime in on this question. <br>
<br>
I'm one of the ferals that does not raid high end content so must rely on badges and arena for gear. The way I handled it was to suck it up and respec like all the non-MS warriors and go PVP resto. I felt it better to invest a small amount of time derailing my pve gearing to ultimately prosper later (granted, at this time, it was before s3 came out and I was already almost full feral s2 for my pve set). I initially had my 4 piece s2 feral set and mixed and matched that with pve healing gear to get by. You really do need resilience because even at the 1500 bracket, some people are running around with Deep Thunders or s1/s2 weapons and will kick the crap out of you. Eventually, I gathered enough arena resto gear which effectively boost my +healing/regen while maintaining (or slightly increasing) my resilience. Now I'm in a great position to collect s3 feral gear to upgrade my 5 pc armor set because I have a very adequate resto pvp gear in order to properly arena with. <br>
<br>
After awhile, for me anyway, arena really became fun as resto and it grew on me. I actually enjoy arena a lot more as resto than feral. For the feralness inside you, there's always world pvp (if you're on a pvp server) and BGs. <br>
<br>
Hope this helps you. <br>
<br>
For further discussion on pvp resto though, I highly suggest the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302195513/http://elitistjerks.com/f38/t14753-druid_resto_pvp_thread/" target="_blank">PVP forum - Resto thread</a> to avoid getting reprimanded by the mods. =)</div>

		<div id="post_message_592159">Most Feral Druids use rip as a finishing attack when they dps a raid boss, however has there been any research into fercious bite being a viable finishing move on raid bosses that are not immune to bleed?<br>
However due to AP not scaling between 4cp and 5cp rip<br>
also taking into account the ferocious bite talent(15%more)<br>
Having a high %crit and ap.<br>
Is their any point when it would better to use Ferocious bite?<br>
<br>
i know their is some skepticism because it dumps all your energy but you can time it right around the 35 energy mark it might be already<br>
<br>
i was playing around testing damage today ons ome level 67 elites outside gruul's lair, with 3000 AP <br>
Rip ticked for 542 (5)times (once in it did less damage like 437 couldn't figure out why)<br>
and ferious bite was landing for about 1400 (non-crit) so rip right now is certainly better, <br>
<br>
but possibly once you have very high AP and crit around 5000AP raid buffed and 50%crit or so it could be better? anyone have to gear itemization that could run a few tests? <br>
<br>
i've looked around couldn't find any math or other threads on this idea</div>

		<div id="post_message_592176">I don't personally use FB on any of the fights with bleed immune mobs due to the fact that I'm shredding for ~3.4-3.5k and FB seems to do around 4.5-5k tops, but can consume a bloodlust proc and actually hurt your DPS.<br>
<br>
Edit: Ideal situations I'm sitting at 52% crit/4.6k AP and the highest FB I've seen is ~5500. My GM is sitting at around 48% crit and 5k AP+ and had a 6k FB the other night. <br>
<br>
<br>
My question is about grips of damnation. I just picked these up as none of the rogues need them anymore and I've been toying around with the thought of using them. According to Toskk's they're very good, however the 2 pieces of t4 that I still use are shoulders/gloves. I've been considering convincing my guild to run mags so I can get the t4 chest to use for DPS (currently using Shadowprowlers). I just picked up the S3 helm or I would have gotten shoulders/head for the 2pc. But I'm curious as to what pieces you think are the best to use.</div>

		<div id="post_message_592177">I read some of the topic, including whole starting post and i could not find an explanation for this: what does it mean when i have about 32k armor in bear form and it says ''75% mitigation towards all physical attacks''? Did they change it or is there a typo or something in the topic, since it says that 37k armor is 75% mitigation? Very odd.<br>
<br>
Also is this absolutely sure that defense DOES NOT affect crushing blows by any way? Because I am kind of in a situation where we've basically got 2x druid tanks in the guild, me and an other chap that i am slightly better geared of. The deal is each time he has tanked Morogrim they have one-shotted him, and each time i have done it - well we ended up switching for a warrior tank (well we downed him once with me tanking). And no i do not get crit at all because i am capped, crushing blows are the issue here.<br>
<br>
Differences in our gear: I am wearing s3 chest, he is wearing heavy clefthoof. He is wearing s2 shoulders, i am wearing t4 shoulders. He has earthwarden, i have wildfury greatstaff. Otherwise our gear is fully the same (the parts that have defense/resilience on them are: violet signet of the great protector, shermanar great ring, veteran's dragonhide bracers, he has juggernaut's decklase and i have the one from maiden.)<br>
<br>
Also a few differences: i have +33ap and +16 hit rate enchant on my t4 head, because i am waiting to get s3 head and make that my tanking head along with changing veteran's dragonhide bracers to the badge-bracers, and slap the s3 head with +16 defense and +17 dodge.<br>
<br>
Also, in his s2 shoulders, he has +10 dodge and +15 defense, while i am still not exalted with aldor so i only have +13 dodge.<br>
<br>
So, the final line is - he has way more defense than i do due to earthwarden, heavy clefthoof chest and the enchants on his shoulders and head. He can survive morogrim, i get crushed to death very often. Someone explain please.<br>
<br>
Actually, i can link our armory-profiles, we both mostly wear our tanking-gear so should be alright:<br>

About the armor, read the tooltip better.  It states 75% mitigation against lvl70 mobs.  75% mitigation against lvl73 boss mobs is 37k.  Defense has no bearing on crushings, its 15% always for us becuase we dont have a way to push them off the hit table via sheild block. If there are so little differences between you and the other druid its you being unlucky or something is false on your account.  Crit immunity is 415def rating which is 2.64% with 3/3 sotf talent or an equal amount of resilience (around 100+).  If you both are indeed crit immune then the only difference between the two of you in damage terms is the amount of armor/dodge you both have.  Or maybe you tank with 4k less hp lol<br>

</div>Well crits weren't mainly the problem there, it was the crushes. I usually got crit like max twice during those fights, or none, but i got crushed like no end. So i guess it must be the gaddamn luck factor.<br>
<br>
Well in terms of gear i think i kind of used a bit wrong words, maybe woulda been better to say ''minorily higher tier'' but either way, we both got about the same hp, I have more dodge, he is over the crit-immune cap, and i am so close to it it hasn't screwed anything up so far. Ok so this indicates there was only a luck factor involved, since i got crit like once or twice during a whole fight, that both got healed up, but a streak of crushes wiped us about 3 times &gt;&lt;.<br>

</div>Where was this shown? FB CAN use up too much energy but using it when you're near 35 energy at 5 combo points is more DPE than Shred. It makes sense to keep shredding until you get to a situation where your energy is near 35 to use FB. Not using it at all is not maximizing your DPS against bleed immunes.</div>

		<div id="post_message_592256">There are still a few ways you can mitigate crushes: <br>
 <br>
- get over 85% avoidance against the boss. In tank gear I can occasionally get above that level by popping two avoidance trinkets; it's possible the other feral druid reacted to 2 crushes by popping double avoidance trinkets.  <br>
 <br>
- get parried less.  You can do this by gaining more expertise, and once you get a decent aggro lead, take lacerates and swipes out of your attack cycle.  Since you're not focusing a ton on movement/etc on Morogrim, you can probably wait to only lacerate/swipe/mangle at close to 100% health.  If you're not at 100%, you should be at the ready for your emergency buttons.  <br>
 <br>
- use bear potion/healthstone macros if you aren't already. <br>
 <br>
About being crit immune: If a boss normally hits for 6k, you need at least 9k health to survive a crush, but 12k to survive a crit. If you're above 9k before 90% of boss hits but only above 12k on 80% of boss hits, 1% crit reduction will save your life every 1000 boss swings; assume a boss swing every 2s, that's 2000 seconds, or about 33 minutes of active boss tanking. <br>
 <br>
Obviously you'll have to adjust for your raid scenario (ability of your healers keeping you topped off, crit reduction you still need, particular boss), but even a tenth of a percent of missing crit reduction will lead to a wipe per week if you tank every boss. <br>
 <br>
And that's only looking at the crit as the potential killing blow; nevermind the fact that you'll more frequently get in low-health situations if you occasionally get crit. <br>
 <br>
Feral druids are chosen to tank boss fights by their ability to mitigate spike damage. If you're not crit immune, you're giving away your best (only?) class advantage over other tanks.</div>

</div>You really should work on crit immunity. You say you got unlucky with crushings, that can be. But why even add more chance of burst damage by just shrugging off getting critted?<br>
<br>
My advice is to fix that first. Get the tanking enchant on your helm and reenchant your bracers with 12 defense rating.<br>
Chance your cloak enchant to 12 agility instead of 12 dodge rating.<br>
If you can get the badges for <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=29386"><span><span class="purplename">[Necklace of the Juggernaut]</span></span></a>, then do that.<br>
<br>
I guess doing all that you will be slightly ahead of the other Druid's gear.</div>

I've recently gotten my hands on the tier 4 gloves (only one that could use them) and I've heard how great the 2 piece proc is for cat... but how good is it for bear? I had originally planned to upgrade by arena/badges and then work my way forward from there. My dodge isnt all that great yet (as I am missing some things and I'm waiting for upgrades before using bigger gems and enchants) compaired to our MT druid (he is somewhere about 45-49% dodge).<br>
<br>
Anyways I was wondering if at high avoidance level, how much can you feel the extra rage?, right now I get hit enough to have to spam swipe to bring my rage down on Nightbane/Prince in kara. But once I get some upgrades (and proper enchants/gems) will the T4-2pc shine on certain encounters in bear? The S3 gloves certainly does on some fights when you are low on interupters(cat), and once I get another T4 I will use them as cat (when interupting isnt needed).

</div>For raid tanking I find it to be a minor benefit, not worth worrying about, but for 5mans, or even 10 mans it can definitely provide benefit.  The "once I get another T4 I will use them as cat" is somewhat bizarre.  There is no reason to have 2 pairs of T4 Feral gloves.  Either tanking or DPS you should use the same enchant. (15 agi)  Both 15str and the stam enchants pale in comparison.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Feral is certainly viable in arena, though not the most common. I'd recommend you find a few videos featuring Ferals (my favorite thus far has been the "Deep Feral 5" commentary) to see how it all works out in arena. After that, find a partner or two that you like and have fun with it! It's possible to get to the top tier ratings as feral.<br>
<br>
That being said, you may have an easier time finding partners as a Resto, if that's a concern.</div>

</div>And Deep has now given up on Feral Arena and does so as Resto or Balance/Resto.  The fact of the matter is Feral is not really arena "viable" it can push to the high ratings, but it requires some absolutely exceptional play to do so.

</div>Your number is the correct one I think, 37k is too high. I usually just go with 36k since that is easier to remember than 35880. &lt;_&lt;</div>

<br>
Agility = ~0.07% ((~14.7 agility per % dodge, or ~13 agility on gear per %dodge with SotF and BoK)) [[Same crit conversion as for Cat form]] [[Grace of Air is 77 agility (90 improved) which comes out as approximately 6% dodge (7% improved) in a raid environment]]<br>
Dodge Rating = ~0.05% ((18.9 dodge rating per % dodge))<br>
Stamina = 15.45 health (17 raid buffed)<br>
Defence = 2.4 rating per skill, 1 skill = 0.04% dodge, miss, anti-crit ((25 defence, or 60 rating, for 1% less crit/more dodge/more miss))<br>
Resillience = ~0.025% anti-crit ((39.4 resillience for 1% less crit and 1% less damage from DOTs))<br>
Armour - ~37k armour to be capped at 75% reduction versus level 73 mobs.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>With SotF you need 2.6% additional anti-crit from gear to become immune to crits vs level 73s and 0.2% less for every level below that. So 2.4% anti-crit vs level 72, 2.2% vs level 71 and 2.0% vs level 70.<br>
<br>
Resilience and defense rating simply add up. See the rating conversions above. For example 40 resilience rating (1% anti crit) and 96 defense rating (1.6%) will grant you 2.6% anti-crit and make you immune to crits vs a level 73 mob.<br>
<br>
If you are as lazy as me, I suggest you get this fancy addon called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304042112/http://wow.curse.com/downloads/details/992/" target="_blank">TankPoints | World of Warcraft @ Curse.com</a>. With it you can experiment ingame how much more res/def rating you need to become immune to the mob level of your choice.<br>
<br>
Oh and, the armor figure is too high in the quoted part, it should be ~36k (or well, 35880 if you want to be precise).</div>

According to the above stats 2.6 % would be 156 def rating for a lvl 73 mob which to my knowledge is the lvl of bosses (correct me if i'm wrong). Something doesn't seem to add up. Unless the character paper doll stats that display your def rating take the talent into consideration which would make this a silly post :P. Can you clarify?</div>

</div>The number you want is 415 total defense (NOT rating). That is your 350 base defense plus 65 defense from gear. 65 defense are in fact 156 defense <b>rating</b> so that is where you got the number from (and yeah, raid bosses are level 73).<br>
This is true if you have absolutely no resilience btw, if you have some you will obviously need less than 415 defense.<br>
<br>
And the paperdoll does not take SotF into consideration so you will just have to pile up enough res/def until you have 2.6% anti-crit as feral, and obviously 3% more if you don't have SotF (like Warriors/Paladins that need 490 defense to get crit immune).<br>
<br>
<br>
Oh, and while I don't care about your lack of proper capitalization in your posts I advise you to start using them since some do care (mods especially) so save yourself and them the time to remind you via an infraction. </div>

Battle Shout: Rank 8 = 305 AP. Solarians Sapphire = +70, Improved = +35%, HotW = +10%, UR = +10% /// <b>total: 497//611 AP</b><br>
<br>
Strength of Earth: Rank 6: 86 Str. BoK = +10%, Improved = +16%, Str conversion = x2, HotW = +10%, UR = +10% /// <b>total: 241 AP</b><br>
<br>
Grace of Air: Rank 3: 77 Agi. BoK = +10% Improved = +16%, crit conversion = /25, HotW = +10% AP, UR = +10% AP /// <b>total: ~4% crit, 119 AP</b><br>
<br>
Assuming you get just BS without a sapphire, and only SoE, you gain ~750AP straight up, then assuming you have 4k AP without these buffs you'd gain about 400AP extra from UR (i.e. 1150 total AP gain). Yes, that really does equal 200+ DPS lost. <br>
<br>
As an aside, you've probably got a warning/ban incoming from ignoring the forum rules about profile/"proper" english in your post.<br>

</div>What is your armor and HP?<br>
<br>
In my guild, we actually switched from warrior to druid because it was easier to heal. However you need to be properly geared, which means being crit immune and having reasonable armor and HP.<br>
<br>
I tank morogrim with 34k armor and 21k HP, dodge i guess about 45%-50% depends on buffs. But dodge is not that important there.<br>
<br>
p.s. replace your gloves enchant with 15 agility, it is better than 15 str for both tanking and damage</div>

</div>Sounds like you're partly having trouble because others are being lazy and not waiting for agro. As long as you manage your rage well (not using maul unless you have a lot of excess rage) it won't be your fault. If you want to switch gear it might be worth it, especially as your healers probably outgear the content you're doing (from the sounds of it at least). Getting some expertise might also be the answer - the heroic badge neck (stam/hit/expertise) and shapeshifters signet will get you a lot of effective +hit, which will help a lot especially at the start. If regearing doesn't work and you're managing your rage properly, it's probably overenthusiatic DPS.<br>
<br>
As for ravage, that's a pretty weak buff. I still don't think it'll ever be worth it unless it's the case of someone sitting down in pvp on half health.</div>

</div>It was mostly due to people calling it a 'buff' or a 'weak buff'.<br>

As an opener, nothing whatsoever changed. If you can one-shot or two-shot someone using it - go ahead. If not, don't use it. I don't see why this should be any different now that it does a bit more damage.</div>

</div>My situation's similar to yours, Kodus. I'm playing a feral alt to tank entry-level content like heroics and 10-mans while our mains farm Illidork. I've run into quite a different issue, though. I'm having a hard time staying alive versus heroic mobs, even though I have all the standard recommended blues for feral tanking (Heavy Clefthoof, Honored kara ring, Braxxis staff, etc). I'm sitting at about 15k health fully buffed, 22k armor, 25% dodge, and I'm getting SMOKED. The massive amount of healing I require causes our healer to pull insane threat, even though I usually work with a paladin (.25 threat per heal). I can't imagine how bad a shaman (.425) or druid healer (.4) would get smeared across the floor trying to heal me. What can I do to solve this? I can't very well get my Earthwarden if I can't handle tanking the requisite Coilfang heroics... not even PUGs do Steamvaults normal on my server these days.</div>

1. Keep looking for normal SV pickups.<br>
2. Remember to demo roar as mobs come in; that'll cut down on your healer threat, as well as give you more initial threat.<br>
3. Triple-check the first post in this thread, specifically, the section on threat generation; there's likely stuff there that we both miss (though I'm -still- not clear on whether lacerate's innate threat works on a bleed immune mob).<br>
4. If you want a little extra threat on a mob, you might also start with starfire+moonfire before shifting into bear and FFing. I sometimes do this to get aggro on three things before they even close.  Hurricane can also work in some cases.</div>

</div>Your gear is a mixture of good and bad. You posted *fully buffed* stats but that doesn't mean anything (To me fully buffed means Kings, Blood Pact, Fort, GOA etc), always post stats selfbuffed (ie. MOTW only). Anyway you are probably undergeared slightly (or just on par) for heroics (Which are more difficult than Karazhan in your situation). Your Dodge is average, health is fine, armor is fine, you havn't posted if you are crittable which is worrying.<br>
<br>
Asking gear advice is not the goal of this thread, however I would suggest than you post which skill rotation you use for threat (Like Cat DPS it can make a huge difference). Having said that you shouldn't be getting hit *that* hard enough with your gear (I was tanking in similar gear both Heroics + Karazhan last year). <br>
<br>

		<div id="post_message_595073">Thanks Kew. I'm all set for 1 and 2, but 4 is an interesting idea that I'll try to start implementing.<br>
<br>
Tidia, sorry if it's confusing. I logged in my cat gear and I'm at work, so I'm having to go off memory. I think I'm at around 13k health without fort + kings. I have 415 defense as well - there's a couple high-agi kara pieces I could swap in if I had more defense/resil gear, so I'll have to hit the AV grind pretty hard this week.<br>
<br>
When AoE tanking, I frantically tab-spam and swipe + mangle when it's up, but I find I can't maul while tabbing... if I tab before the maul goes off, it cancels the maul. Any way around this? I can't seem to dump rage quickly enough on four-pulls and I end up having to charge+taunt the ones that peel off toward the healer.</div>

Good idea, having said that Earthwarden isn't the be all and end all.<br>

2. Remember to demo roar as mobs come in; that'll cut down on your healer threat, as well as give you more initial threat.<br>
<br>
Miminal threat, but good idea to always keep this up (every little bit helps)<br>
<br>
3. Triple-check the first post in this thread, specifically, the section on threat generation; there's likely stuff there that we both miss (though I'm -still- not clear on whether lacerate's innate threat works on a bleed immune mob).<br>
<br>
Read more than this guide, that will help you gain perspective on topical issues.<br>
<br>
4. If you want a little extra threat on a mob, you might also start with starfire+moonfire before shifting into bear and FFing. I sometimes do this to get aggro on three things before they even close.  Hurricane can also work in some cases.<br>
<br>
I never use this, except in 3+ pulls (which you should never do in your gear). In 2 mob pulls (Heroic) Mark one Skull, one X. Pull using FFF on skull, activate dodge trinket, Maul and mangle X, Lacerate Skull, when mangle refreshes Mangle X again, then DPS skull. (That should be all needed, when Skull is at 15% Bash and change targets to X).</div>

		<div id="post_message_595125">For new bear druids, the Vindicator gear should really be priority #1 as it's so easy to get yet so good for both tanking and dps.  I can't stress enough how much easier your life will become just by getting the bracers and belt first as then your defense needs from there are greatly minimized and you have a lot more gearing options.  I prefer resilience so I also had a Resolute Cape made when I started Kara way back when.  It lasted until I picked up a Pepe's in Hyjal so you can't go wrong by getting one in my opinion.<br>
<br>
As far as some helpful tanking tips.  I never use Maul unless I have 60+ rage as Maul eats up your white attacks.  Doing this lowers the probability of you being rage starved which is very bad for your TPS.  So when tanking in a multi-mob situation I pull with fairy fire and make sure my auto attack is on, then mangle and lacerate spam until I have enough rage to add in maul while refreshing mangle on every CD.  I tab through each mob and make sure each 1 gets 1 lacerate stack before moving to the next mob.  Once every mob has 1 lacerate stack I focus on my main target and hopefully it's dead before the lacerate is up.  If it's not then I'll refresh the lacerate stack on the off-tanked mobs.  <br>
<br>
This works really well until your average swipe damage is in the 150 range at which time you can just use white damage, mangle and swipe to easily hold aggro in multi-mob situations.  Hope that helps.</div>

</div>You can hit the armor cap in T5 gear.  Irregardless the difference between 33k armor and the armor cap is so neglible that you probably wouldn't even notice if you actually were at the cap.  Once you get beyond 29k unbuffed you should focus more on getting your dodge up to a good level to help with your avoidance as being just one big mana sponge isn't very fun in the end.</div>

</div>Ah, thanx for the solid advice on where armor becomes less useful than avoidance!  I have around 40% selfbuffed dodge right now, because I mostly socket pure agi so my DPS and Tanking gear can be shared (plus I get enough stam from raid buffs anyway).  I reach around 50% raid buffed dodge with GoA and Kings, and then Idol of Terror procs give me that much more.  I do wish I had some more T5 so I could benefit from the vastly improved stam on it, though.<br>
<br>
Which reminds me... I stuck solid stars of Elune into my t5, in preparation for making it a high-stam set once I get a few more pieces.  Would it make more sense to socket agi and just pump that dodge up even further?  I've reached 20k HP fully raid buffed and flasked on our Kael attempts these last weeks, if that helps you get an idea of how much stam I might or might not want to go for, over avoidance stats.<br>
<br>
And on that note, is it just me, or does it seem unfair that warrior tanking gear has SO MUCH stam, and so many sockets to put EVEN MORE stam, that my guild's MT has like 2-3k more HP than I do?  I'm a Tauren bear for crying out loud, I get +50% stam in bear form, and I'm still significantly below him!  Maybe it'll even out a bit once I get more T5 I guess.</div>

</div>The difference between 33K armor and the cap is about 6% less damage taken (comparing physical damage taken at the cap, with physical damage taken at 33K armor).  Is that not noticeable?<br>
<br>
Stack armor.  Gem for stam, enchant for agility.  If you can get good agility/dodge as secondary stats on armor while doing it, GREAT!  Once you hit the armor cap, then you can start worry about swapping pieces for less armor and more dodge or stam.</div>

		<div id="post_message_595245">6% of a 3000dmg hit is 180 damage or at 5000 it's 300 extra damage.  So no, it's not that noticable and the odds of it being a major difference between you dying and not dying are probably pretty minor.  Keep in mind that we're talking about self-buffed.  At 29k and above you'll hit the armor cap with the +armor procs that occur during raids, which if you are MTing something they will probably be up consistently.<br>
<br>
As far as STA goes, it really depends on your role.  If you OT for the most part then I don't see it as being a big deal with you having less health than your warrior who MT's as he's probably using +12 or +15STA gems while you are using +8 or +10agi gems in most every slot.  I think my guild's MT has around 21-22k health raid buffed while I'll be at the 17-18k range depending on the pots I'm using.  This is more than sufficient as my dodge is over 50% and I have capped armor even without trying as the T5 set items and T6 non-set/Vindicator gear has so much of it.</div>

		<div id="post_message_595269">It depends on what your 33k includes. If it's unbuffed, there should be virtually no difference between that and capped (devo aura/motw = nearly 2k armour). If you regularly have an inspiration/ancestral fort specced healer, again the difference should be pretty small from 30k+, as long as they have decent gear.<br>
<br>
The entire problem I have with people saying "get to the cap then you can swap gear etc." is that I never got to the cap. I never even got close to the cap (31k or so). I don't understand how you can get to the cap with a decent gear setup that isn't purely stacking armour for the sake of it, still have good threat and then have so much armour you can start swapping pieces out as well as being crit immune. I understand people aren't talking out of their arses when they say they're capped (I can identify gear sets that have it) but I don't see the advantage in the lost balance of other stats while wearing those setups. Sticking to a target of 30k armour gives you so much more freedom of gear than going for ~36k, and if you are mostly in a hybrid role it's much more benefit to have relatively solid tanking stats and much better threat/damage than it is to stack tanking loads, then find you're not useful because your agro is crap/damage is poor. <br>
<br>
@ Karmen, you might want to read the first post. Pretty much every useful point you made is in there, and for multimob tanking swipe is superior to lacerate by a long way right from the start (the break even point is approximately where swipe is doing 225 damage total, which is about 75 on each mob as long as you're hitting 3). As much as it might seem counter-intuitive, swipe is also better in a situation with crowd control than lacerate is. If you happen to break a sheep with swipe you weren't paying attention but it can get resheeped - if you do the same with lacerate you're screwed for the next 15 seconds (other than the sheep getting resheeped constantly for that time). Also as Duilliath pointed out, the actual lacerate bleed damage means bugger all in threat terms.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">It looks like 2.3.2 removed the hotfix that made it possible to powershift with one key press (Without /cancelform in the macro). Anyone else experiencing this issue? Previously I was able to use the macro /cast Cat Form to powershift from cat to cat, but it doesn't seem to be working. Cross forms works fine however.<br>
<br>
Edit: Using /cancelform makes it work again. But then you lose the mana check. Very frustrating how Blizzard forgets to add hotfixes to the patch.</div>

Stack armor.  Gem for stam, enchant for agility.  If you can get good agility/dodge as secondary stats on armor while doing it, GREAT!  Once you hit the armor cap, then you can start worry about swapping pieces for less armor and more dodge or stam.</div>

</div>This is wrong statement imo. Do not talk about 3000 hit. That will not kill even the squishiest clothie in the raid. Where it is important is when the tank receives massive spike damage, from my experience e.g. Tidalvess who can do insane burst dmg via windfury. It is a difference whether you get hit for 18000 or 17000 within 2 seconds.<br>
<br>
The point of the "stack armor to cap, then dodge" is such that when you decide between items that have similar iLvl, you prefer the one where armor is increased over some agi/dodge focused piece until you reach the cap (buffed). Thats all.</div>

The ring slot is in my opinion where you can dump armor for a much better stat ring if you have access to BT/MH loot both supremus and morogrim rings are an upgrade.<br>

</div>I guess my argument is that pre SSC, there isn't a fight that's long enough to make dodge an important aspect of reducing healer mana usage - armor does it just as well and more importantly is predictable giving a smoother healing pattern.  25% dodge sounds like someone with no tier armor, and mostly statless armor pieces (heavy clefthoof) that has socketed stamina.  I wouldn't consider it average, but with appropriate armor I would consider it adequate.<br>
<br>
If it were the choice between 2900 armor (starting from 33K armor) and 6% dodge, I'd take the armor when my sole role in the fight is to tank.  6% dodge is something like 88 agility and if I understand item points properly costs 88 item points..  2900 bearform armor is something like 725 caster form armor, and costs 72.5 item points.  There's a slight inaccuracy in there with the agility, but I'll leave that as an exercise for the experienced theory crafter to work out the precise comparison <br>
<br>
I'm all for getting your mitigation and avoidance stats the best place you can find them, but I don't buy that you have to drop so much to get strong armor.<br>
<br>
Now, for specialized encounters, where mitigation isn't as important and you can't reliably keep threat generation strong with your best tank gear, by all means have a stronger threat, lower mitigation set.   I haven't yet found a fight up to all bosses in SSC and TK where I couldn't keep excess threat with my strongest tanking gear.  And most of those where I offtank in a very slight tank role I can wear dps + tier gear and it suffices just fine.<br>

</div>I've tanked Gruul the last 15% without an offtank.  Just because you can and have done it doesn't make it a good idea to do all the time or to recommend to those just starting out <br>
<br>
So yeah, it all depends on your situation, but for someone starting off, you really can't go too wrong choosing high armor pieces if you're mainly tanking.</div>

As far as more Armor vs. Dodge, the gentlemen that pointed out Tidalvass's burst is a bit off base.  Tidalvass's burst comes from 4-5 attacks happening in a 2 second period adding up to that 17-18k total burst, not just one big attack.  As Duke's is already pointing out you'd have a better chance of surviving having a better dodge chance against that then having 3% more mitigation.

I'd suggest to them that 5% to ranged and melee crit chance of all party members w/in 45 yards is a considerable contribution to the overall raid dps.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I've seen alot of 2.3 macros on here, but I'm surprised I havn't seen the following, so I thought I'd post my current PTR macros:<br>
<br>
Basically, the idea is that currently I have three "shift" keys.<br>
B (Bear Form), C (Cat Form), and V (Travel).<br>
<br>
Now originally, I just had the following:<br>
<br>
/cancelform<br>
/cast &lt;form&gt;<br>
<br>
The problem here was that there was no good way to get back into caster form.<br>
I essentially wanted B to take me into bear form, if I was in any other form, but I wanted to exit Bear form if I was already in bear form.<br>
<br>
Here's my solutions:<br>
MACRO 3 "Cat" Ability_Druid_CatForm<br>
/cancelform [nostance:3]<br>
/cast Cat Form(Shapeshift)<br>
END<br>
<br>
MACRO 10 "B Macro" Ability_Racial_BearForm<br>
/cancelform [nostance:1]<br>
/cast Dire Bear Form(Shapeshift)<br>
END<br>
<br>
This is untested, but should work, will test and report findings:<br>
MACRO 1 "HawkCheetah" Ability_Druid_TravelForm<br>
/cancelform [stance:1/3]<br>
/cast [swimming]Aquatic Form; [nocombat,flyable]Flight Form; [noswimming]Travel Form<br>
END<br>
<br>
Any thoughts?<br>
<br>
I also had this idea, but no time to test it as of yet. I'll post my findings once the PTR is back up as it appears to be down. This also assumes you can still do script type coding in macros. (its been awhile)<br>
<br>
local nStance = GetShapeshiftForm(true);<br>
/cancelform<br>
/use Super Healing Potion<br>
CastShapeshiftForm(nStance);<br>
<br>
The idea here is that you would need only one macro to use the potion for every form.</div>

At lower gear levels yes putting you in a dps group is the better way to go, as rogues and warriors pull WAYYY out in front you end up with an equation like this:<br>
<br>
your dps + 5% crit bonus damage from 4 other players in group  &lt; another rogues dps.<br>
<br>
Simply put its better for the raid if the other rogue gets battle shout and windfury than if you give them lotp.  Admitadly in melee aoe heavy fights then LOTP helps out with healing but that isnt a pure dps consideration.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">6% dodge counts as a lot more mitigation than 6% damage reduction. See <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302204033/http://elitistjerks.com/580477-post1146.html" target="_blank">here</a> for an explanation. 88 agility is also ~3.5% crit, which is not insignificant by a long way.<br>
 <br>
For bears, agility is worth so much point-for-point compared to other stats that I would go as far as saying it's the best overall stat. This doesn't mean "stack agility", it means stack agility within reason.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>Every analysis tool I've seen places a high premium on high armor items as best stat for any slot.  I.e., Emmerald's lists, Rawr when you're not building that 100% dodge set, and so on.   Badge is ALWAYS the best trinket, Violet/A'dal's are ALWAYS the best rings, Swift Paw are always the best bracers, Den Mothers are always best boots, Belt of Natural Power is best belt, T6 is always best armor... The only slot where the highest-armor piece isn't at the top is Cloak, and even then the best item is only 50 or so armor behind the highest. And then you're over armor cap.  <br>
 <br>
Also, in a worst-case sense, armor mitigates crushing blows while dodge only pushes hits off the table (and not crushes).   This makes armor mitigation "less spiky" and dodge mitigation "more spiky".   Anecdotally, healers overheal less with less spiky damage and are more ready to heal you as a tank as opposed to others with more armor. <br>
 <br>
Finally, with the exception of multi-mob and undergeared scenarios, I've never heard of a druid having threat problems.  At that point, the extra crit only lets a druid stop spamming specials, which reduces parries somewhat. But that's hard to measure and relatively minor to the overall picture.<br>
 <br>
Essentially, my argument is that armor doesn't stop being the best stat at 30k.<br>
 <br>
The limited number of arguments I'd think acceptable for not being close to armor capped in standard tank gear when you could be: <br>
- You have stacked avoidance to a ridiculous point already (and eat Agi food, use Agi elixir, and Agi scroll even for farming pulls)<br>
- You frequently have a shaman/priest as an assigned healer on you (rare for a tank, since resto shammies and CoH priests tend to be raid healers)<br>
- You don't need to get better tank gear at all, for instance because you aren't asked to tank frequently at the T6 level</div>

</div>Because it works the other way round.<br>
<br>
If you take a Boss from, say, 5k armour to 4k armour... you'll do more damage. It's a 20% reduction in his total armour. If you take him from 4k to 3k, it's a 25% total reduction. Take him from 5k to 3k and... well, you get the idea. Until you hit 0, it'll increase the damage done exponentionally.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, rogues appear to have more gear tailored for this, and a large portion of our damage ignores armour anyway. Doesn't make it a useless stat, just not as good as it is for Rogues (or other classes for that matter... I only need to look at the Executioner enchant for that).</div>

		<div id="post_message_596765">The armor vs. avoidance vs. stamina argument is very subjective.  It depends greatly on the fight, buffs, your party setup, and the classes healing you (as well as other things).  I've always been a fan of avoidance since I usually am in the OT roll, providing DPS after my tank target is dead while still stuck in combat.<br>
<br>
However recently, I changed my philosophy about tanking completely, and don't plan on turning back.  I was already becoming skeptical about an end-game avoidance set after having difficulty tanking Teron (with Illidan on farm) even with my gear littered with 10 agility gems.<br>
<br>
With access to excess T6, I created a full stamina set (a few posts were made a few pages ago mentioning this setup).  With this configuration, I tank much better than I did with avoidance gear.  I have more rage so my threat is better and more stam so my overall burst survivability is better.  My overall damage mitigation is less dependent on avoidance so I'm more suitable for a wide variety of fights instead of just physical damage. <br>
<br>
Ignoring possible itemization improvements in Sunwell, I would recommend everyone to gem their primary tier gear and high armor items for full stamina.   <br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
If you think about it, the hybrid argument is silly under current itemization and game content: our base stamina is just too low.  Almost all fights have limited roll switching.  However, if you're tanking something which requires you to be uncritable and sit around 30K+ armor to be effective, you're most likely wearing armor rings, trinkets, and other high armor items -- so your overall DPS is junk anyway.  So why not trade better tanking and survival for a few DPS?  <br>
<br>
As I said above, if your an avoidance hog, I salute you, however I'd urge you to try a high-armor stamina build and compare it with your current setup.</div>

While I recommend gemming everything for 15 stamina, I'm still unsure about a few things and I'm wondering if anyone has any insight:<br>
<br>
1. Which trinkets?  <br>
Shadowmoon Insignia, Badge of Tenacity, Moroes Pocketwatch, or 51 stamina's<br>

2. Which neck?<br>

3. Which flask/elixirs?<br>
Elixir of Fortitude, Elixir of Mastery, Flask of Fortitude, Elixir of Ironskin<br>

I'm now leaning towards:<br>
1. Trinkets: 51 stam trinket instead of the Badge or Pocketwatch, paired with the Shadowmoon Insignia.<br>

As Duke's is already pointing out you'd have a better chance of surviving having a better dodge chance against that then having 3% more mitigation.

</div>No, i am off base. It does not matter really whether it is 1 attack or 5 attacks over 1-2 minute fight (in case of tidalvess). From time to time it will happen that you wont dodge any of these, and you must be able to survive it smoothly. If you have 5% more dodge, does it reliably prevent spikes? I dont think so.

We are OT the only boss lvl mob i get to tank in BT/MH is bloodboil and the rogue at Illidari council.<br>
Also at BT/MH, where you are able to drop armor for other stats in some slots, the warrior has already closed the gap you had at T4, stamina-armor cap.<br>
Raffy the badge's neck is great since it gives AGI, which is an all around stat, without falling too much behind at tanking and threat. About the trinket use what suit best each case. (If you tank Azgalor stam trinket shines, but if you tank bloodboil for 30 sec every 2min Pocketwatch or badge is your friend)</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Every analysis tool I've seen places a high premium on high armor items as best stat for any slot. I.e., Emmerald's lists, Rawr when you're not building that 100% dodge set, and so on. Badge is ALWAYS the best trinket, Violet/A'dal's are ALWAYS the best rings, Swift Paw are always the best bracers, Den Mothers are always best boots, Belt of Natural Power is best belt, T6 is always best armor... The only slot where the highest-armor piece isn't at the top is Cloak, and even then the best item is only 50 or so armor behind the highest. And then you're over armor cap.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>I don't think you understand how those lists are really built then. The way that they are built is that someone puts in some sort of statistical weight for each stat, and then runs an analysis on all the available gear for each slot, and lists them in order of highest ranking. They DO NOT take into account of a) the armour cap, b) the defense/resil cap c) your overall gear set.<br>
 <br>
If you want to do this sort of analysis it is really much better to analyse a variety of sets and consider the overall deltas in terms of what you gain and give up going from one set to another. i.e. I lose 1% dodge but gain 500 hp - is that a decision that is worth making, given the characteristics of the encounter that I am involved in.<br>
 <br>
My max armour gear has around 34k armour on it, and although I usually gem for max stamina in my raid tanking set, I would never contemplate using all 34k armour. To look at the comparison that one earlier poster mentioned - the Hyjal rep ring is a nice thing to switch in when you get past a certain armour point, since it provides both a small stamina uplift as well as a 1.5% dodge improvement. It is really not that valuable to look at each slot seperately but rather to look at your gear in its entirety. Remember that for most bear tanking roles you actually don't even need to be crit immune, for example. I have at least 4-5 tank sets set up in Itemrack for different situations - from 5 man tanking, to trash tanking through to off tanking at Gruul, VR, or Supremus (i.e. consider threat vs mitigation &amp; stamina vs mitigation).</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Because it works the other way round.<br>
<br>
If you take a Boss from, say, 5k armour to 4k armour... you'll do more damage. It's a 20% reduction in his total armour. If you take him from 4k to 3k, it's a 25% total reduction. Take him from 5k to 3k and... well, you get the idea. Until you hit 0, it'll increase the damage done exponentionally.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, rogues appear to have more gear tailored for this, and a large portion of our damage ignores armour anyway. Doesn't make it a useless stat, just not as good as it is for Rogues (or other classes for that matter... I only need to look at the Executioner enchant for that).</div>

		<div id="post_message_597389">How far should I go to avoid wasting item points on crit reduction?  <br>
<br>
My situation is that in my current gear, I run just under 30k armor and slightly over 14k health, with only Mark of the Wild on.  I still use the Heavy Clefthoof Vest and Leggings, both gemmed with Solid Stars of Elune in every slot.  As my guild moves into our first 25-mans, I am looking to boost both my armor and avoidance, since I anticpate offtanking more than MTing.<br>
<br>
In my current gear, I'm slightly over the cap for anti-crit, between the defense on my rings, cloak, HCH pieces, and S1 shoulders.  My next logical upgrade slots are head, chest, legs.  If I get the S3 chest, the 2piece bonus will activate, putting me waaaaaay over.  If I choose the S3 Helm instead, and get Vestments of Hibernation for the chest, the same thing will happen.<br>
<br>
I am reluctant to change out my rings since I'm not armor capped yet.  (Unyielding Force/Grand Protector)<br>

RAWR puts me at between -0.6... and -1.2....% chance to be crit with any of the guaranteed (badges/arena/honor) upgrades available to me.<br>

</div>Going to the Druid Wiki link in the original post will answer both those questions for you, as you'll be able to use Rawr and Toskk's work to determine relative value of tanking and dps gear, respectively. The answer to both your questions is highly dependent on the rest of the gear you have now, and those tools allow you to enter the rest of your gear so you can make a more informed choice.</div>

</div>It's not really a huge problem. Defense over the cap isn't worthless, it's just expensive from an item budget perspective relative to stamina or agility. If you have gems or enchants that add defense, I'd recommend swapping them out to add stamina, agility, or both, but otherwise natural gear upgrades will probably solve this problem for you.<br>

</div>You are correct, assuming that you are the only attacker.  You could in fact reduce a raid bosses health to time to live vs a 12000 dps raid, but its just annoying to deal with. So for the purposes of a rogue or other dps we try to keep it in terms of personal dps and armor pen has increasing returns on personal dps.</div>

</div>I'd add to this point that agility gives the added benefit of more threat (via the extra crit and predatory instincts) and more rage generation (via the crit and primal fury).  The scaling of threat gen with agi is one of the reasons bears have such powerful snap threat; crit mauls and mangles are very effective for establishing aggro.<br>
<br>
Plus (I'm sure this has been mentioned already), there's the added bonus that agi is generally the best stat budgetwise for cat DPS (at a raid-geared level), so when you're OTing and then shift out to DPS, your tank gear is still useful.</div>

</div>Tanking is about threat and mitigation, and ferals generally don't have to worry about threat because it is inherently very good.  Doing more threat on the T6 deaggro fight (Bloodboil) could get you killed, because you need to stay near the threat of other tanks for transitions.   So I would argue that at the T6, optimizing tanking is entirely about mitigation.   Certain mechanics favor dodge (stacking DoTs on Bloodboil, for instance), but those are special-case and not for the "standard" gear set. <br>
 <br>
The discussion was about optimizing tanking gear; as such, your comment about being a druid in a fight, while quite true, is not your original claim, which was only "for bears".</div>

</div>I do it this way for a few reasons:<ul><li> If healers are having trouble healing me when the trinkets are not up, there's a problem with my gear, their gear, or the healing assignments.</li>
<li> In my experience, my healers don't typically have mana problems, and when they do, potions/IV/Mana Tide/etc. are better ways to address it.</li>
<li> I don't want to give my healers a false sense of what my incoming damage is like.  (Ideally, my healers should be spamming me regardless of what my incoming damage is like, but in reality they're going to get a false sense of security when I'm dodging over 75% of the time during trinket uptime).</li>
<li> We ferals don't have shield wall or last stand, so the trinkets server as my "oh crap" buttons.</li>
</ul><br>
Edit: Keep in mind that your #1 priority as a tank is not to die.  If you're dead, nothing else matters.  So, save them for when they'll help you the most (dodging an attack that would otherwise kill you).</div>

</div>I tend to save them for when my health gets uncomfortably low.  But for boss fights where I am the hateful/hurtful strike target I tend to keep them popped as much as possible.  We did TK last week to key a few and on Void Reaver the knockback timer was spot on, so I used the trinkets as much as possible to avoid the knockback/deaggro.</div>

</div>I have never said armour is a bad stat, nor that reaching the cap is a bad thing. It is merely that, for my own personal reasons, I prefer not to use a gearset that gets to the cap because it is too limiting on what other gear can be used <i>for me</i>. I recommend other people against getting to the cap because that's my opinion and tanking is, quite simply, not a set thing. If I were pointing people towards stacking strength and intellect for a DPS role, sure, flame me lots (I'm not saying you're flaming right now, in case you get the wrong idea - it's just a bit of a discussion over the finer points which is what forums are for).<br>
<br>
On the point of threat: Extra potential threat is never wasted. Never. I would like to see a situation where having too much <i>potential</i> threat is a problem. I have always had problems with threat because in the situations which I tanked due to the ridiculous DPS of the people playing with me. If you are generating <i>too much</i> threat, you aren't playing properly and that's a problem with your playing/paying attention, not with gear.<br>
<br>
I would also argue that at the T6 level you are wanting to optimise DPS and survivability against the particular situations you are put in, not blindly stack mitigation "just because".<br>

</div>This is correct, that is why I used the word relatively.  Upping your dodge reduces your chance to be hit, not crushed, until you are above 85% dodge.  In essence, the higher your dodge rate gets (below 85%) the harder you will be hit, when you do get hit.  Healers seem to be of the mind that when we pop trinkets, and our dodge goes through the roof, that we are essence providing the same mitigation that a shield wall would which isn't the case and will thus take little or no damage.  True as long as you are dodging, very wrong when you do actually get hit.</div>

</div>To be fair to both sides of the AC versus Agi discussion, this will always come down to that classic cop-out of "situation and personal preference."  It depends on your playstyle.  It depends on your gear level.  It depends on how good your guild's DPS and healers are.  It depends on the encounter and on what you're tanking.  It depends on who else is also tanking on the encounter.<br>
<br>
I personally lean towards using my highest AC and sta gear when I'm MTing a boss, especially a burst-heavy boss like Tidewalker; but using higher agi, hit, expertise, etc. when I'm offtanking.  I see my character's strengths as being her flexibility in switching between the DPS and Tank roles, even midfight, and her quick, powerful threat generation even when she's not getting hit regularly.  So, I tend to gear and gem for those strengths.  I also have lots of gear choices in my bags at all times.<br>
<br>
However, someone who's almost always used as an MT, or raids with super-low-threat DPS and/or reactive healers, might have more reasons to sacrifice some agi to get to the AC cap.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">How far should I go to avoid wasting item points on crit reduction?  <br>
<br>
My situation is that in my current gear, I run just under 30k armor and slightly over 14k health, with only Mark of the Wild on.  I still use the Heavy Clefthoof Vest and Leggings, both gemmed with Solid Stars of Elune in every slot.  As my guild moves into our first 25-mans, I am looking to boost both my armor and avoidance, since I anticpate offtanking more than MTing.<br>
<br>
In my current gear, I'm slightly over the cap for anti-crit, between the defense on my rings, cloak, HCH pieces, and S1 shoulders.  My next logical upgrade slots are head, chest, legs.  If I get the S3 chest, the 2piece bonus will activate, putting me waaaaaay over.  If I choose the S3 Helm instead, and get Vestments of Hibernation for the chest, the same thing will happen.<br>
<br>
I am reluctant to change out my rings since I'm not armor capped yet.  (Unyielding Force/Grand Protector)<br>
<br>
RAWR puts me at between -0.6... and -1.2....% chance to be crit with any of the guaranteed (badges/arena/honor) upgrades available to me.<br>
<br>
Is this a huge problem?  Or should I just live with the wasted item points until there are more choices?</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>You seem to be at a point where gear upgrades could come quite rapidly given a little luck (with set tokens and rolls/bids/whatever your guild uses) and time investment (badge gear, vidicators pieces, arena gear) and you should probably just stay how you are until you get an upgrade and will possibly have to gem/enchant a new piece anyway. If you have the t4 helm I'd probably get the s3 chest first and I would certainly keep the rings. As someone else already suggested, if you have some gear that you won't replace soon and it has any def or resil socketed in it, see if you can't replace those with more stam/agi. If you're using the Necklace of the Juggernaut, consider picking up the Brooch of Deftness - not exactly an upgrade for your avoidance but you pick up some other nice stats and lose 22 def (and unfortunately 19agi).<br>
<br>
This is just a suggestion, but if your role is going to be OTing for the upcoming content and you still have plenty of resil/def to be crit immune, get the s3 helm next to go with the chest - enchant the helm with a glyph of ferocity and socket the meta with a relentless earthstorm diamond. The yellow slots in the helm and in the BP are decent places to meet your meta requirement (if you're going to be using them to both tank and dps)with 4agi/4hr gems, and stick either shifting nightseye or delicate living rubies in the red bp sockets(and +6 all stats enchant). If you're lucky enough to get your t4 shoulders off maulgar in short order you can enchant those with your respective aldor/scryer dps enchant (if you've still got excessive def/resil to spare) and use the t4 gloves with 15agi. Now you have 4 pieces of gear that are gemmed/enchanted well for both dpsing in cat and tanking in bear. On a fight where you get to wear your dps gear you'll have the best cat gear/enchants/gems in those respective slots until t6, and on fights where you must tank something first (such as maulgar or mag, although I always got stuck tanking mag myself), you'll do more damage when you inevitably switch to cat and dps after your tank target is dead (and produce more threat in an OT situation like on gruul).<br>
<br>
edit: I know I didn't mention gems for the shoulders, if it were me I'd socket 8agi in both but you could easily do 4agi/6sta or 12sta depending on your preference.</div>

	</tbody></table>
</div>I personally use Shadowmoon Insig + Moroes. I really like the +defense that Shadowmoon gives me for becoming crit immune. The two together is what we've started to call "Bear Wall". I actually bound it to a macro to yell it out and pop both trinkets... In the words of another raid member "its like a raid wide heroism. you pop bear wall and everyone gets pumped" I can't tell you the amount of times that 'bear wall' has saved my life in sticky situations...<br>
<br>
For example, a fel raged target dies and goes right back on me at 5%.. BEAR WALL!!! Dodge, Dodge, Dodge.. yay!!<br>
<br>
...<br>
<br>
I actually have one question about something completely different. Sometimes when DPSing I'll get lucky with the omen of clarity, malorne bonuses, crits on shreds, whatever! I find myself sitting at 5 combo points, and there's no way rip will have ticked off by the time I would hit 80+ energy. <br>
<br>
If I have anything that won't let me re-apply rip... I can't do it until its ticked off. I sit at max energy just waiting to start the next cycle.<br>
<br>
So my question is, what is generally accepted as "more" DPS. Doing another shred to delay the energy? Re-applying mangle? Or sitting at 100 energy for 2/3 seconds? <br>
<br>
It doesn't happen very often - but was wondering what you guys had to say about this.</div>

I actually have one question about something completely different. Sometimes when DPSing I'll get lucky with the omen of clarity, malorne bonuses, crits on shreds, whatever! I find myself sitting at 5 combo points, and there's no way rip will have ticked off by the time I would hit 80+ energy. <br>
<br>
If I have anything that won't let me re-apply rip... I can't do it until its ticked off. I sit at max energy just waiting to start the next cycle.<br>
<br>
So my question is, what is generally accepted as "more" DPS. Doing another shred to delay the energy? Re-applying mangle? Or sitting at 100 energy for 2/3 seconds? <br>
<br>
It doesn't happen very often - but was wondering what you guys had to say about this.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>I can't give you any hard numbers but on the rare occasion that happens to me, I always go with an extra shred unless, due to some imperfect cycle, mangle is going to run out before rip finishes - then I'll re-apply mangle. Anything would be better than sitting at full energy for 2-3 seconds...even using Tiger's Fury.</div>

		<div id="post_message_597992">This was actually analyzed in a previous feral druid thread, in the context of re-apply Rip vs. Shred again. If I recall correctly, the conclusion was that you shred again if the time on your Rip exceeds two ticks, otherwise reapply Rip. If your Rip is un-reappliable, you would naturally Shred rather than sitting with full energy.<br>
<br>
This is actually a decision I have to make very frequently, which makes me question how useful the Malorne 2-piece bonus really is after a certain point in crit &amp; sustained haste (in terms of chain Bloodlust &amp; Drums).</div>

Optimally aim for 295 resistance from your gear, as you'll get 70 from the hunter/paladin aura.<br>
<br>
Yes, it is easy to stay crit immune.<br>
<br>
I usually OT but had to MT last week and just used:<br>
<br>
Earthwarden<br>
Timelapse Shard<br>
Adamantite Figurine<br>
Shoulder defense enchant<br>
Ironskin Potion<br>
<br>
Just those alone get you to crit immunity against a lvl 73 mob.<br>
<br>
Fill in the rest with greens to 295 resist and you are good to go. Optimally get the epic ring, JC neck, and the resist head enchant. Just use greens of &gt;lvl 65 in other slots, can add those resist armor patches also.<br>
<br>
Once you hit 295 resist, you should have room for 2-3 pieces of your normal tanking gear to help out your threat.<br>
<br>
It's actually fairly easy and cheap to be both uncrittable and resist capped.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>It can be done, though the warriors get showered in Resist gear and you'll have to grab greenie/blues of the AH for it. Preferably level 69-70 ones, for the far better stats on them.<br>
<br>
Make sure you are the Nature res tank, if possible. The JC frost resistance ring is missing 16 stamina vs the Nature Res one.<br>
<br>
One idea might be to try the various Nameds in the Ethereum Prisons (the single key/person ones, not the elites). The Frigid Band (frost) or Living Band (nature) are quite nice if you don't need the defense from a ring slot.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_598296"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I was the frost phase tank for our guild since our first Hydross kill. Used a mix of Nax resi gear and greens and to be honest, was never crit immun. Crits are only dangerous with the 100% damage debuff on you. I think I got killed a few times while or after moving Hydross to phase 2 but never before. So usually a combat rez or soulstone could fix it.<br>
<br>
There is one big advantage, Druids have over warriors as Hydross tanks, the pull. Shifting from stealth to bear direct in front of Hydross makes sure, that he will not move at all. But I heard the aggro range got nerfed, so its maybe not a problem anymore.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_598320"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Aye, the Elixir of Ironskin is pretty nice -- it basically lets you wear any neck/trinket/ring combination (tanking oriented) without worrying about being crit.<br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
That being said, it reminds me of the real problem I have with the end-game Feral druid experience: a clear lack of focus.  <br>
<br>
Ferals are the ultimate roll-switcher amungst the Druid specs, yet even in our most flexible configuration, we still cannot, even in the best gear, play like a "real" Feral Druid (ie. fill multiple rolls effectively without exiting combat and changing gear).<br>
<br>
While some of this distaste may be due to the existance and overall worship of the conventional raid healing/dps meter, I feel the problem goes much deeper than being "80% of a rogue and 80% of a warrior." <br>
<br>
Overall, I think Blizzard has done a really poor (and almost ignorant) job of providing us with a spec that scales and performs well in high-stamina/end-game envirnoments.  Even after countless hours of play, I still don't exactly understand what Blizzard had planned for the Feral spec.  Since hitting 70 in the Burning Crusade, we have been plagued with itemization problems -- serious itemization problems.  No other class has suffered so greatly purely from developer ignorance. <br>
<br>
However, without blabbing on about furthur Feral pitfalls, I'd like to express my concern about the lack of focus given to the Feral class and I worry the next expansion might bring more of the same. I think the Feral community should urge Blizzard to better define our class as the next expansion approaches.  <br>
<br>
---<br>
<br>
Here are a few ideas I had about improving our spec and refining our focus:<br>
<br>
Edgy's Wish List<br>
<br>
I personally feel our spec should be far more damage (Cat) oriented: with the ability to offtank (Bear) or emergency heal (Cast) in the same set of gear.  <br>
-- by offtank, I mean similar to the role we play but less of an ability to main tank. <br>
-- by heal, I mean have the freedom and sustainability to occasionally heal nearby players without serious mana concenrs (see below). <br>
<br>
** We shouldn't require two (or more) distinct sets of gear: a true tank/dps hybrid should be able to do both effectively in the same set of gear.  Instead, our itemization should encourage hybridization and well-rounded, roll-switching playstyles.<br>
<br>
** Armor-laden weapons, trinkets, and rings are a pathetic fix for our class.  It's like FAP, but worse because it consumes the item budget.  All of our armor should come from traditional armor.  Instead, Feral talents should provide an Improved Bear form which provides and improved armor modifier to compensate for the loss of armor.  <br>
<br>
** While in a Feral form, the damage done by physical DoTs (bleeds) should be mitigated by armor. (like Defensive Stance, Improved Defensive Stance, and Improved Righteous Fury)<br>
<br>
** We should be crit immune (-5.6%) purely through Feral talents.  We should never need to wear +defense/resilience to tank.<br>
<br>
** Feral talents should make Agility provide additional effects in Feral and Caster forms:<br>
-- Feral benefit: increase the chance of getting partial hits (ie. "almost dodged").<br>
-- Caster benefit: increase mana regen (like Aspect of the Viper).<br>
<br>
** Feral talents should make Strength provide additional effects in Feral and Caster forms: <br>
-- Feral: reduce incoming damage by converting a percentage of the attack into a short-duration DoT effect (similar to a Block, but without any damage reduction; similar to Deep Wounds, except it reduces the initial damage by the total bleed damage).  <br>
-- Caster: increase +healing (like Nurturing Instincts)<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Maybe a minor point but badge&gt;moroes in my opinion - the longer duration on the dodge buff (20s vs 10s) is huge for fights like Gurtogg. If you aren't using the new Idol, get it, that's another ~4.5% dodge that should be up around 1/2 the time.<br>
 <br>
[e] Edgy/Raffy, that's a bit of an overly hopeful and unbalanced wishlist, I'm afraid. I don't want to be overly harsh, I think you have a few good ideas, you are particularly correct talking about the "fix" that we get through FAP which is plain stupid really, particularly considering how badly we scale with AP. However it seems like you want to be able to tank like a warrior, dps like a rogue, and heal like a shaman all in the same gear. That will never happen. What I will say is this, at various points in MH, obviously with gear changes, we can put out 1500 dps, tank trash &amp; some bosses (usually Anetheron), and then add useful healing and decursing at Archimonde. I don't know what more you want than that.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Just those alone get you to crit immunity against a lvl 73 mob.<br>
<br>
Fill in the rest with greens to 295 resist and you are good to go. Optimally get the epic ring, JC neck, and the resist head enchant. Just use greens of &gt;lvl 65 in other slots, can add those resist armor patches also.<br>
<br>
Once you hit 295 resist, you should have room for 2-3 pieces of your normal tanking gear to help out your threat.<br>
<br>
It's actually fairly easy and cheap to be both uncrittable and resist capped.</div>

</div>This sounds very encouraging for our druid tank. I have checked the stats of the items you quoted, here is my calculation, please correct me if I'm wrong:<br>
<br>
Earthwarden: 27 def rating<br>
Timelapse Shard: 24 resi rating<br>
Adamantine Figurine: 32 def rating<br>
Greater Inscription of the Knight (Scryer): 15 def rating<br>
Greater Inscription of Warding (Aldor): 10 def rating<br>
Elixir of Ironskin: 30 resi rating<br>
<br>
Total resi rating: 54<br>
Total def rating: 74 (Scryer) or 69 (Aldor)<br>
These give:<br>
resilience: 54/39.4=1.371% anti-crit<br>
defense: 74/2.37*0.04=1.249% anti-crit for Scryer (1.165% Aldor)<br>
<br>
Total anti-crit: 2.620% Scryer, 2.536% Aldor.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, our druid is Aldor, so he will need one more item. However, overall this is extremely encouraging, thanks a lot for your input.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Here are a few ideas I had about improving our spec and refining our focus:<br>
<br>
Edgy's Wish List<br>
<br>
I personally feel our spec should be far more damage (Cat) oriented: with the ability to offtank (Bear) or emergency heal (Cast) in the same set of gear.  <br>
-- by offtank, I mean similar to the role we play but less of an ability to main tank. <br>
-- by heal, I mean have the freedom and sustainability to occasionally heal nearby players without serious mana concenrs (see below). <br>
<br>
** We shouldn't require two (or more) distinct sets of gear: a true tank/dps hybrid should be able to do both effectively in the same set of gear.  Instead, our itemization should encourage hybridization and well-rounded, roll-switching playstyles.<br>
<br>
** Armor-laden weapons, trinkets, and rings are a pathetic fix for our class.  It's like FAP, but worse because it consumes the item budget.  All of our armor should come from traditional armor.  Instead, Feral talents should provide an Improved Bear form which provides and improved armor modifier to compensate for the loss of armor.  <br>
<br>
** While in a Feral form, the damage done by physical DoTs (bleeds) should be mitigated by armor. (like Defensive Stance, Improved Defensive Stance, and Improved Righteous Fury)<br>
<br>
** We should be crit immune (-5.6%) purely through Feral talents.  We should never need to wear +defense/resilience to tank.<br>
<br>
** Feral talents should make Agility provide additional effects in Feral and Caster forms:<br>
-- Feral benefit: increase the chance of getting partial hits (ie. "almost dodged").<br>
-- Caster benefit: increase mana regen (like Aspect of the Viper).<br>
<br>
** Feral talents should make Strength provide additional effects in Feral and Caster forms: <br>
-- Feral: reduce incoming damage by converting a percentage of the attack into a short-duration DoT effect (similar to a Block, but without any damage reduction; similar to Deep Wounds, except it reduces the initial damage by the total bleed damage).  <br>
-- Caster: increase +healing (like Nurturing Instincts)</div>

</div>  Yeah, thats not going to happen anytime soon.  The versatility that everyone seems to overlook with Feral spec is that we are afforded the ability to tank, DPS, and even heal (gear dependent) within the same spec.  That is already a bone of contention with many other classes, especially warriors.  I don't see Blizzard compounding the gripe by adding an all powerful set of armor, or even too many more caster oriented Feral talents (like N.I.).  I am sure we could put together a true "hybrid" set of gear, it would probably look alot like S2 Gladiator, in that it affords us all the nifty stats we are so dependant on.  The only problem with that is we will be thrust into mediocrity in every facit.  <br>

</div>You're wrong.  Against Bloodboil, I can wear "mostly" DPS gear (switching a ring,  trinkets, belt, boots to tank), switch to heal with an 8k mana pool if he enrages against a particularly squishy raid member and make the difference between him living and dying, switch to tank if one of our tanks go down and catch up enough on aggro enough to save the raid, and end up in the top 10 in DPS, all in one gearset.  <br>
 <br>
As a druid, you can only "sustain" one role for a fight-- in the above case, DPS.  You'll only be good for about a minute pumping out max heals, you can't really sustain tanking the whole fight, but you can definitely be the difference-maker between wiping and winning, in every aspect of that fight.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<u><b>Trinkets</b></u><br>
The main options for trinkets are (listed top to bottom in approximate order of goodness):<br>
<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30664" target="_blank">[Living Root of the Wildheart]</a> - Bad. Very bad for where it is. Not even really worth it if you're going to be in bear form half the time really (which is very few fights anyway). <br>
<a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28034" target="_blank">[Hourglass of the Unraveller]</a> - A very good trinket for where you get it. ((proc = 45 second cooldown, 10% chance))<br>
<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=29383" target="_blank">[Bloodlust Brooch]</a> - Easy-ish to get and very effective. ((2 minute cooldown))<br>
<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=31856" target="_blank">[Darkmoon Card: Crusade]</a> - Quite hard to get, but also quite good once you get it. How good it is depends on fight more than anything (lots of movement = bad).<br>
<a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32654" target="_blank">[Crystalforged Trinket]</a> - One of the best trinkets to get, and very easy to get too. ((1 minute cooldown))<br>
<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32486" target="_blank">[Ashtongue Talisman of Equilibrium]</a> - Quite good, but not quite as good as some of the other trinkets. There's been a lot of discussion in the past about it, because it depends on how much/when you mangle as to how effective it is. Because of the standard DPS cycle meaning that it's not possible to have it active when you're about to rip, it loses some of it's effectiveness. It's still a good trinket though, and comparable to the rest. Due to using strength it will lose a small amount of power post 2.3 though, which is worth noting.<br>
<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30627" target="_blank">[Tsunami Talisman]</a> - Upgraded version of the Hourglass. Not much more to say.<br>
<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32505" target="_blank">[Madness of the Betrayer]</a> - Hard to get but very good, as long as you aren't hit capped. ((not sure on proc rate))<br>
<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28830" target="_blank">[Dragonspine Trophy]</a> - Apparently still the best around, even after all the nerfs. Be warned that you may recieve some skepticism from other physical DPS classes if you express an interest in it.</div>

</div>Well I am Top DPS in my guild, and Top Tank, so the guild puts me in DPS whenever the online Tanks are good, I have a Cat DPS gear and a Tanking one.<br>
<br>
On my Cat DPS Gear, I have a trinket that wasn't posted here <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28288" target="_blank">[Abacus of Violent Odds]</a>  in conjuntion with <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32770" target="_blank">[Skyguard Silver Cross]</a>.<br>
I would like to know if the Abacus trinket is better than the <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32654" target="_blank">[Crystalforged Trinket]</a>.<br>
<br>
And if I should try to replace either with <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=29383" target="_blank">[Bloodlust Brooch]</a> or <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28034" target="_blank">[Hourglass of the Unraveller]</a> (these last 2 I don't have but I can get them easy)<br>
<br>
In Cat form I have 3140 AP with 39.83% Crit Unbuffed(only Motw), I wonder if I should change Strength Gems/enchants I have for More Agility to Achieve more Crit, or there is a Crit Cap?<br>
<br>
Fully Raid Buffed I get around 3550 AP and 46% Crit with <a class="q1" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=22831" target="_blank">[Elixir of Major Agility]</a><br>
<br>
Well I leave the Armory link to my character where u can see the Gems and Enchants and Gear I currently have equipped. &gt; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080416093357/http://www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Magtheridon&amp;n=Dragonmaster" target="_blank">The World of Warcraft Armory</a><br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Edgy/Raffy, that's a bit of an overly hopeful and unbalanced wishlist, I'm afraid. I don't want to be overly harsh, I think you have a few good ideas, you are particularly correct talking about the "fix" that we get through FAP which is plain stupid really, particularly considering how badly we scale with AP. However it seems like you want to be able to tank like a warrior, dps like a rogue, and heal like a shaman all in the same gear. That will never happen. What I will say is this, at various points in MH, obviously with gear changes, we can put out 1500 dps, tank trash &amp; some bosses (usually Anetheron), and then add useful healing and decursing at Archimonde. I don't know what more you want than that.</div>

</div>Yeah, it was a "wish list," however, my point was that I'd like to change how we function overall.  I'd like less focus on primary tanking (feral talents should just provided an improved armor modifier which allows us, in full DPS gear, to offtank) in exchange for more flexibility and hybridization.<br>
<br>
We shouldn't need to have two separate sets to offtank and DPS.  If we're stuck full-time tanking something designed for a shield/plate-wearer, ie. Bloodboil, our competitiveness should come from purely from our stamina pool (via more stamina oriented gear, possibly offset items).  However, for almost every other scenario, we should be able to primary DPS and effectively offtank in the same gear.  <br>

</div>"You're wrong," I'm not exactly sure what you mean -- however, what you stated is basically exactly what I was saying above.  Our primary role should DPS, and we should have the ability to either offtank or emergency heal.  We are far more flexible in the DPS role, than in the tank role, however our primary raid role is offtanking.  <br>
<br>
In high-tier gear, in the DPS role, its much more viable to shift bear and offtank something (especially in T6) or shift caster and heal something.  However, while tanking in DPS gear, our stamina pool is pathetic, our overall damage mitigation is spikey, and we're susceptible to crits.  While healing in DPS gear, we have zero mana regen and no "hybrid" way of restoring it (see my idea above about "aspect of the viper" while in feral forms).  In equivalent/traditional tank gear, our Cat DPS is significantly lower (due to wasted budget on defense, resilience, extra armor, and avoidance) and while active tanking, we're for the most part unable to heal (and still suffer from the same mana problems).<br>
<br>
Overall, I'm pushing for something exactly like the S3 arena set for my "wish list" single PvE set.  Amazing stamina and ideal for Cat DPS (agi, str, crit, hit, armor pen) except with armor values almost double their current PvP values.  Remember, I want to completely abolish the idea of armor-laden weapons, rings, and trinkets (its a pathetic bandaid as mentioned above and completely goes against the idea of tank/dps hybrid).  Our only primary tanking stat should be stamina if we're stuck in that roll for an entire fight.<br>
<br>
Just look at the complete failure Blizzard gives us in terms of Armor progression:<br>
-- Trinket: Badge of Tenacity, 308 armor, BoE available pre-kara<br>
-- Rings: #1 is from exalted kara, #2 is from Magtheridon, the 2nd 25-man instance in outlands<br>
-- Weapons: Earthwarden, a purchasable exalted cenarion reward, has the same armor as our best tanking weapon<br>
-- In terms of our 5 pieces of tier gear: <br>
T4: 16247 bear form armor, 158 stamina<br>
T5: 16373 bear form armor (126 more armor), 196 stamina (38 more stamina, +1 socket)<br>
T6: 17336 bear form armor (963 more armor than T5; 1089 more than T4), 217 stamina (21 more stamina, +1 socket than T5; 59 more stamina, +2 socket than T4)<br>

So it's pretty clear, Blizzard has the same idea I have -- bear form should just be innately powerful for offtanking -- however they failed to implement proper itemization and insisted on requiring additional armor be gained through stupid items like armor rings, trinkets, and weapons.  When clearly, a stronger Feral armor modifier should of been the solution. (I'm sure some of this failure relates back to the big stamina, armor, and damage nerf.)<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Well I am Top DPS in my guild, and Top Tank, so the guild puts me in DPS whenever the online Tanks are good, I have a Cat DPS gear and a Tanking one.<br>
<br>
On my Cat DPS Gear, I have a trinket that wasn't posted here <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28288" target="_blank">[Abacus of Violent Odds]</a>  in conjuntion with <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32770" target="_blank">[Skyguard Silver Cross]</a>.<br>
I would like to know if the Abacus trinket is better than the <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32654" target="_blank">[Crystalforged Trinket]</a>.<br>
<br>
And if I should try to replace either with <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=29383" target="_blank">[Bloodlust Brooch]</a> or <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28034" target="_blank">[Hourglass of the Unraveller]</a> (these last 2 I don't have but I can get them easy)<br>
<br>
In Cat form I have 3140 AP with 39.83% Crit Unbuffed(only Motw), I wonder if I should change Strength Gems/enchants I have for More Agility to Achieve more Crit, or there is a Crit Cap?<br>
<br>
Fully Raid Buffed I get around 3550 AP and 46% Crit with <a class="q1" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=22831" target="_blank">[Elixir of Major Agility]</a><br>

It will give you an idea, based on proven numbers, where you will find the largest upgrade in your DPS.  That being said, my two cents would be to replace <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32770" target="_blank">[Skyguard Silver Cross]</a> with <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28034" target="_blank">[Hourglass of the Unraveller]</a>, at least for raid DPS roles.  The added AP from the proc will be more useful than the tiny amount of crit advantage on the SSC, especially considering that proc is wasted on most all boss fights.<br>
<br>
As for <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28288" target="_blank">[Abacus of Violent Odds]</a>, it isn't as effective for a druid as it is for a rogue because we are in essence swinging a 2 hand weapon on a 1 second swing timer, and thus the haste only increases the speed of 1 weapon versus 2 weapons with a rogue.  I would personally pick up a <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=29383" target="_blank">[Bloodlust Brooch]</a> to replace it.  Again, mostly my opinion, but do some testing and see what works best for you.<br>

</div>It's a failure because the net armor gain from 5 pieces of T4 to T6 is only ~1200 bear form armor. Hell, a Warrior gains 6750 armor in T4 and 8156 armor in T6 -- 1406 armor, ~200 more than we do, and they don't get the bear form modifier!<br>
<br>
Only a full-time OT role should require additional gear (ie. armor/gems/trinkets loaded with stamina). Every other encounter should let you DPS and tank in the same gear.  Defense and resilience should never enter the equation, nor the need for defensive enchants.  <br>
<br>
This would all be possible currently, if, through feral talents, we could get -5.6% crit (instead of -3%), tiered gear provided more significant armor upgrades, and a stronger bear form modifier.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I am sorry if you dislike my "wish list" ideas -- its just some ideas, and I'm not asking for a buff.  I am merely pointing out that with the next expansion, without significant changes, we cannot expect to scale properly.  We will be once again plagued with itemization problems that won't be fixed until far into the content just like the Burning Crusade.<br>
<br>
The cost of extra armor on regular armor, weapons, trinkets, and rings is too much to continue scaling properly (since theirs no default armor by default provided through item level on rings, weapons, or trinkets, for example).  We have already experienced this problem in the Burning Crusade.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">The provision of overall mitigation is relatively low. A parry reduces swing speed by ~40% from where it currently is (so a 2 second attack will have, on average, a 0.4 second reduction in swing speed from a parry). This means you gain 20% damage per parry on an attack, so with a standard 12% parry from a boss, you take 12*0.2 + 100 = 102.4% of the "actual" damage you should take. This means its ~0.25% damage mitigation from 20 expertise rating, or 0.05% damage mitigation from 1 rating. Not really worth that much by itself.</div>

</div>I'm struggling to understand the specifics of how a boss' parry mechanic works.  I'm chalking this up to my lack of theorycrafting skills, so if anyone can dumb this down for me a little I'd appreciate it.<br>
<br>
What I think I understand is that when a boss parrys you, their next swing gains a "haste type" buff making it land sooner.  In Dukes' example he's looking at a 2.0 swing speed gaining a 40% speed buff.  In my mind, this means that the melee hit is still going to hit for the same amount of damage it always does, it's just going to happen sooner.  But then Dukes' says "you gain 20% damage per parry on an attack" which seems to mean to me that the next melee swing will do 20% more damage than the normal melee hit.  Maybe it's just a wording thing, but to me this seems like two different things.<br>
<br>
So my first question is, what should I be seeing when looking at parrys?  The same amount of damage per melee swing, but more of them?  Or, a slightly bigger melee swing after each parry?<br>
<br>
Looking at my WWS stats from Morogrim last night brings me to my second question.  I'm wondering if someone can clarify what these two separate columns in the WWS hit table for a mob are for?<br>

</div>So we've got the <b>Normal </b>melee swings and the <b>Landed </b>melee swings.  Seems pretty straightforward, except I'm not sure what buffs, spells, abilities make his melee swings land for more than the normal.  Is this a direct reflection of the damage he's gaining due to parrys?  Or is it displaying the difference due to other factors?<br>
<br>
Thanks very much if anyone can help me with this.<br>

		<div id="post_message_598974"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I am not a raiding druid and do most of my shape shifting in various Battle ground situations.  lately I am finding that my shape shifting skills are extremely compromised.  Up until the last few days, or current patch possibly, I was able to shift multiple times one after the other.  I used this to good effect while in combat with mages who liked to drop ice all over the place.<br>
<br>
  The last few days when ever I try to shape shift I am getting stuck out of form and my macro seems to be nearly worthless.  I did some macro modifications which helped a bit but still it's so annoying and at times fatal.<br>
<br>
  Am I alone in seeing this?<br>
<br>
  what I have tried is a basic macro with only one line:  /Cast cat form.  This has been effective in the past but I have also used the two line version:  /cancel form  /cast cat form.<br>
<br>
  In an attempt to see if I could do better I also tried /cancel form  /cast cat form /cast dire bear form.  This 3 line verison was handy because it seemed to work better and had the effect of working like a toggle switch.  Each time I worked the macro if I was in cat form I switched to bear form and vice versa.<br>
<br>
 Perhaps I need to rework my macros or there really is a problem.  I would like to know because I really enjoy this feral druid now and dont want to put him away waiting on a fix.  <br>
<br>
 I realize that I may be on the squishy side still with barely 200 resiliance and a mixed bag of s1, s2, s3 and even some green gear but I am working my way down the list.  I at least now have enough for the set bonus but still a ways to go.<br>
<br>
please let me know as I am pretty sure I am not alone in this.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>

<br>
So we've got the <b>Normal </b>melee swings and the <b>Landed </b>melee swings.  Seems pretty straightforward, except I'm not sure what buffs, spells, abilities make his melee swings land for more than the normal.  Is this a direct reflection of the damage he's gaining due to parrys?  Or is it displaying the difference due to other factors?<br>
<br>
Thanks very much if anyone can help me with this.<br>

</div>It's the wording you are tripping over, you have the concept down I think.<br>
<br>
Given an encounter with a set time, let's say 2 minutes, and a set swing speed of 2 seconds, you can figure out exactly how many times you will be hit.  Now, when you parry a boss he receives a reduction in the time it takes for him to make his next attack.  Ugh, I wanted to avoid math but here goes...<br>
<br>
Based on our scenario you will be hit 60 times.  Lets assume it is for a static amount, and in an effort to keep it easy on my brain lets say the boss hit's for 1000.<br>
<br>
So, in the course of that fight, assuming either you do not parry, or their is no parry mechanic you will take 60,000 damage.<br>
<br>
Now, when you parry and it speeds up his attack you are increasing the amount of swings that the boss can take in that 2 minute window. Using dukes math<br>

This means you gain 20% damage per parry on an attack, so with a standard 12% parry from a boss, you take 12*0.2 + 100 = 102.4% of the "actual" damage you should take. This means its ~0.25% damage mitigation from 20 expertise rating, or 0.05% damage mitigation from 1 rating. Not really worth that much by itself.

</div>5 parries (each parry providing a decrease in attack time of 0.4 seconds) will provide enough time (2 seconds of time saved) to add an extra attack inside our 2 minute window, thus increasing the damage dealt by 1000 over that 2 minute window, and an effective DPS increase of 8.333.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Parrys increase the amount of damage you would otherwise take in the same timeframe, not the amount of damage from the actual swing. It increases the DPS of the swing by up to 40%, i.e. 2 seconds, 10k damage, you take 5k DPS for that swing, whilst 2 seconds reduced to 1.2 seconds, 10k damage, you take 8.333k DPS for that swing.<br>
<br>
For example:<br>
<br>
1 minute of fighting. 2 second "normal" swing speed, 0 parrys = 30 hits.<br>
<br>
1 minute of fighting, 2 second "normal" swing speed, 5 parrys, average case = 32 hits.<br>
Why average case? It increases the speed of the swing from when you get the parry - if you get it half way through a swing, he'll only swing 0.4 seconds faster, and this will be the average amount you'll get over a statistically significant period of time.<br>
<br>
<br>
Landed hits are all hits landed on you. Normal hits are all normal hits on you. Landed = Normal + (Crushing/Glancing), dependant on if it's your hits or hits on you.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I am not a raiding druid and do most of my shape shifting in various Battle ground situations.  lately I am finding that my shape shifting skills are extremely compromised.  Up until the last few days, or current patch possibly, I was able to shift multiple times one after the other.  I used this to good effect while in combat with mages who liked to drop ice all over the place.<br>
<br>
  The last few days when ever I try to shape shift I am getting stuck out of form and my macro seems to be nearly worthless.  I did some macro modifications which helped a bit but still it's so annoying and at times fatal.<br>
<br>
  Am I alone in seeing this?<br>
<br>
  what I have tried is a basic macro with only one line:  /Cast cat form.  This has been effective in the past but I have also used the two line version:  /cancel form  /cast cat form.<br>
<br>
  In an attempt to see if I could do better I also tried /cancel form  /cast cat form /cast dire bear form.  This 3 line verison was handy because it seemed to work better and had the effect of working like a toggle switch.  Each time I worked the macro if I was in cat form I switched to bear form and vice versa.<br>
<br>
 Perhaps I need to rework my macros or there really is a problem.  I would like to know because I really enjoy this feral druid now and dont want to put him away waiting on a fix.  <br>
<br>
 I realize that I may be on the squishy side still with barely 200 resiliance and a mixed bag of s1, s2, s3 and even some green gear but I am working my way down the list.  I at least now have enough for the set bonus but still a ways to go.<br>
<br>
please let me know as I am pretty sure I am not alone in this.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>

</div>What bar mod do you use?<br>
<br>
I would recommend bartender3 because it allows you to bind shapeshifting to keys and eliminates the need for macros.  Actually, you really shouldn't need macros even with the default UI because of the addition of direct shifting 2 patches ago, so if you are getting stuck in caster, definitely get away from your macro's and go with the default shift keys.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I am sorry if you dislike my "wish list" ideas -- its just some ideas, and I'm not asking for a buff.  I am merely pointing out that with the next expansion, without significant changes, we cannot expect to scale properly.  We will be once again plagued with itemization problems that won't be fixed until far into the content just like the Burning Crusade.<br>
<br>
The cost of extra armor on regular armor, weapons, trinkets, and rings is too much to continue scaling properly (since theirs no default armor by default provided through item level on rings, weapons, or trinkets, for example).  We have already experienced this problem in the Burning Crusade.</div>

</div>There is no rule that says you need 2 sets of gear to switch between the two roles. In fact, I carry 2-3 20 slot bags full of equipment with me that I switch out a few pieces here or there tailoring the set to the current role. You can already choose to gear a "hybrid" feral that uses high armor DPS equipment. Our tier sets fall into this category, as well as pieces like <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30042"><span><span class="purplename">[Belt of Natural Power]</span></span></a> and <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32593"><span><span class="purplename">[Treads of the Den Mother]</span></span></a>. The fact that many <i>maximum</i> DPS pieces (ie. rogue leather) available do not have high armor is done on purpose. We need to choose to maximize damage, tanking, or hybridize between the two. You can already do what you're asking by wearing a hybrid set.<br>
<br>
As an off-tank, many times I don't bother reaching the anti-crit cap. An example would be Hex Lord Malacrass. We often kill 3 or even all 4 of the adds before engaging the boss. I off-tank this in nearly full DPS gear, but I choose high armor dps pieces including some with extra int to allow more shifting and emergency healing.<br>
<br>
You are asking to be the equivalent of a DPS warrior putting a shield on to tank an add. We have done this often from Mag's Lair through Hyjal, but we generally need to kill their add first. Personally, I want the ability to compete with the prot warrior, not the dps warrior. Otherwise, they will just take the warrior instead of us (like pre-BC). Being able to do this with a simple gear switch is why warriors hate us. If we could do it without a gear switch, why bring warriors?<br>
<br>
In Item Rack, I have many sets pre-made including max armor, max stam, max dodge, default MT, default OT, max DPS, stam DPS, armor DPS, and more. The ability to change gear and change our focus is a <b>GOOD</b> thing.</div>

</div>I was having the same problem.  Shapeshift keys were the last buttons that I transfered over form clicking to pressing so it was a pain to find an appropriate place for them.  I settled on shift+1 --&gt; shift+5 and it has really worked rather well for me.  Also, a huge suggestion would be to make a simple keybinding for /nostance and throw it on a hidden bar.  I have mine bound to the tilde (`) key.  Simply returns you to caster form, but is a life saver for throwing off spot heals and all that other druid jazz.</div>

</div>If you go into configure you can choose which attacks are showing.  I'm sure you'll notice that the difference between "Landed" and "Normal" can be found in the "Crushing" column (although if your gear is such, you might also find some landed attacks went to the crit column).

</div>I can see someone make the argument that when they run from mob to mob, they shift bear, feral charge, then shift back to cat, essentially making the running time only the distance between you and within charge range.  I won't take that any further, though, because you get into a "what's your energy when you've just finished killing something" argument that doesn't have a "right" answer. <br>
<br>
Also, I believe that the Feral Swiftness talent, which is pretty standard for most specs, doesn't stack with run speed to boots, so it's a pure loss in Hyjal in catform.</div>

</div>This, for a class with a Charge ability plus run speed in cat form it is a waste in Hyjal.  <br>
<br>
However in most other instances, you lose the run speed, so it is still a fair enchant, but I would just use charge (don't need a macro for it nowadays) and have the extra agility.</div>

<br>
As far as I can see pure agility will probably be better if:<br>
- You act as a tank for the bosses where you have to move most (stuff like supremus);<br>
- You use the same boots for both tanking and dpsing (although that's debatable, I suppose); or<br>
- You regularly get to use dash when moving, or you find you can use charge to close the gap in the situations where you do have to move.<br>
<br>
It's hard to quantify the benefit when there are a lot of different ways people play their characters. For a shaman it's relatively easy to quantify - there's no speed buff (sprint/dash), no charge mechanic, and you are always performing the same role while in that gear.</div>

		<div id="post_message_599715">If I used the same boots for tanking and DPSing I would want Cat's Swiftness on them even more. Take Hyjal for instance- I spend most of my time tanking on trash, when Minor Speed is actually quite nice to move around in addition to using Charge. On Archimonde I find myself in caster form decursing a lot as I move back from an Air Burst or a bad Doomfire, when Minor Speed is again helping me return to the fight more quickly and thus raising my DPS. Using Feral Charge to get back to Archimonde after you've been driven away is usually a great way to get Doomfired.<br>
<br>
Allev: It's not necessarily a question of how much energy you have when the mob dies as how much energy you <i>would have</i> as you get back to the mob/reach the next mob, which is almost always 100 if you didn't switch forms along the way. This means you lose ~40-60 energy by Feral Charging. I don't know how long a cat with/without speed on boots takes outdoors/indoors to close the same gap that Feral Charge closes, but it's worth investigating.<br>
<br>
That said, valid points.</div>

The "crit cap" is at about 75% from behind (25% glancing which you can never remove) and the same from the front (although getting enough expertise to remove all parrys is pretty insane, and you'd never DPS from the front anyway).<br>
<br>
For all intents and purposes, there's no crit cap at the current time because gear and buffs just won't let you get that much %crit.</div>

For a druid attacking a boss from behind, this is: <br>
100% - (25% + (9% - mitigation from hitrating) + (6% or so - mitigation from expertise) + 0%)<br>

2- It is indeed possible to get over the white hit cap by a few percent, using the most-crit-without-taking-hit items in each slot (65% crit and 1.4% hit or so).  This gearset does some pretty sub-optimal things, though (like taking the 8 Agi libram instead of the hit/AP enchant).

				<div style="font-style:italic">It's a failure because the net armor gain from 5 pieces of T4 to T6 is only ~1200 bear form armor. Hell, a Warrior gains 6750 armor in T4 and 8156 armor in T6 -- 1406 armor, ~200 more than we do, and they don't get the bear form modifier!<br>
<br>
Only a full-time OT role should require additional gear (ie. armor/gems/trinkets loaded with stamina). Every other encounter should let you DPS and tank in the same gear.  Defense and resilience should never enter the equation, nor the need for defensive enchants.  <br>
<br>

		<div id="post_message_601631"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I have a question about maximizing raid dps while filling a dps slot in a particular fight.<br>
<br>
I know the proper cycle for maximizing individual cat dps has been beaten to death, however, is it maximized for raid dps?<br>
<br>
The cycle I have been using is (assuming a situation where powershifting is impractical)<br>
<br>
Mangle, Shred to 5cp's, wait for 80+energy then rip, mangle.<br>
<br>
Now, using this cycle, the mangle debuff will usually fall off after the last shred, while waiting for my energy to return, before I rip and mangle. How will this downtime in the debuff affect the dps being done by the rogues and warriors on non bleed-immune mobs? We usually run a raid with 2 rogues, 1 dps warrior. Though, occasionally a second warrior or third rogue will come into play. <br>
<br>
Basically, is there ever a situation where it is most beneficial to break cycle and keep the mangle debuff up?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>If no-one else is applying Mangle then you should be doing it to boost your own Rip damage as well as the bleeds from other classes (Rupture, Deep Wounds, ...).  Using Rip with Mangle has been shown to be beneficial for personal DPS numerous times in this forum. The second post of this thread (<b>The Cat post</b> <u>DPS Cycle</u>) even describes the attack cycle you should be using.   In my humble opinion, there's no need at this time to collect stats to prove it again. <br>
<br>
Sure, if you can get someone else to be the "mangle bitch" (to reuse a term used on these forums :) such as a lower geared kitty or a bear tank, then "keep on shreddin'" and you will have a boost to your DPS.  Otherwise, ensure Mangle is up and miss out on the occasional Shred whilst doing so.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Why do you think the AC upgrade from T4 to T6 is insufficient?  Wearing 4T4/1T5 or 2T4/3T5 along with badge/craftable/kara items in my other slots, I'm already AC capped against bosses in raids (i.e. with devo aura).  The various healing talents that give armor bonuses are already wasted on me.  More armor would really be a waste item budget-wise.  Stamina, dodge, and threat stats all get big upgrades from T4 to T6, and I feel that's much more valuable than just being AC capped unbuffed.</div>

	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>I don't think I said anything about wanting more armor, instead, I stated the majority of our armor should come from our core pieces and/or a better Bear form armor modifier (feral talent, unavailable to resto).  Armor is one of our primary tanking stats, yet it scales pathetically across the spectrum from T4 to T6.<br>
<br>
As a tank/dps hybrid, our armor should come purely from traditional slots (core armor pieces, leg, bracer, belt, boots), and not from slots which have 0 armor by default (weapon, ring, trinket).  (I guess weapon armor is debatable because its changeable in combat.)<br>
<br>
There should be no reason to have these items with extra armor.  Gear of this type does nothing except make our class less hybrid and less able to fill the role of tank/dps, instead, we're usually stuck choosing one. <br>
<br>
Higher armor on the core PvE pieces would finally separate the S3 feral gear from T6 and allow both to scale better without the PvP items infringing on PvE armor values.  Less dependance on armor from rings and trinkets (lets face it, they might as well say Classes: Druid) would give us more gear configurations, and incentive to wear tanking rings with agility (which would also help for DPS).  <br>
<br>
Currently, two rings, a trinket, and a weapon give us nearly 9000 bear form armor.  If instead, we gained significantly more armor as we upgraded our core pieces, we could swap out our low tier armor rings (best being Karazhan and Magtheridon), and transition to something with more stamina and agility.</div>

It is clear that the most widely accepted rotation is this:<br>

Wait till enough energy then<br>

My question is this:<br>

Knowing that you rip with 4 combo points, you averagely Mangle much more often than  if you waited for 5 combo points. However the last combo point would have been acquired by a Shred, which deals much more damage than a Mangle.

</div>A rogue is likely missing out on one tick of rupture for each of your damage cycles.<br>
<br>
A warrior is possibly missing one tick of deep wounds for each of your damage cycles. I say possibly as I'm not sure if they fixed the bug where if you crit with deep wounds active, it resets the tick timer meaning that a highly geared fury-haste warrior doesn't get many ticks due to it resetting a lot.<br>
<br>
Find out what your rogues average damage rupture tick is, and the same for deep wounds for a warrior. Then find out the difference between a mangle hit and a shred hit. The easiest way to do this is to use WWS. Then do:<br>
<br>
[(rupture tick * 0.3 * no. rogues) + (deep wounds tick * 0.3 * no. warriors)] - (average shred - average mangle) <br>
<br>
If the answer is positive, you should break the cycle, if negative you shouldn't break the cycle.<br>

</div>The combo points thing tends to be personal preference and down to personal gear. At a high level (T6) you'll likely have such a high crit rate (50%+) that shredding to 4 points then refreshing Rip is a complete waste as a lot of the time you'll still have a rip going when you get to 80+ energy. The cycle is more of a dynamic thing rather than a static checklist - you should always be evaluating how many points you have, how much time you have left on the rip/mangle debuffs, and how much energy you have (and whether it's possible to powershift).<br>
<br>
You should also be able to check this with some of the spreadsheets/Toskk's calculator, as I think they have functions for it (Toskk's lets you specify number of shreds after a mangle, IIRC).</div>

				<strong>Question about tanking Hyjal Waves</strong>
			</div>
			<hr size="1" style="color:#FFFFFF">
			<!-- / icon and title -->
		
		
		<!-- message -->
		<div id="post_message_602119">Two questions here, recently our protection pally gquit and for the first time we had to tank the waves with two prot warriors and myself.  Before it was so easy as the pally just tanked everything except the heavy hitters.  We'd group everthing up about 10secs after the wave started and aoe evething down. <br>
<br>
Now there is considerably more chaos regarding the waves with the highest number of mobs.  The 2 tanks and I would try to group up together like we did before (~10secs after the wave started), and many times we lose aggro on few mobs, a mage or lock dies, and it just wastes so much time.<br>
<br>
Speaking to the two warriors it seemed evident that we'd either lose track of our fourth or fifth mobs that we were tanking or more commonly, waste time tab targeting through other peoples mobs because its just so congested in the aoe group.<br>
<br>
Is it better now without a prot pally just to grab 4-5 mobs and then have 3 seperate groups (2 warriors and me) for dps to burn down? <br>
<br>
Another really important question concering this is tab-targeting throught 4-5 mobs and having to look for your first mob whose lacerate you have to refresh in a crowd of 20 mobs and npcs running everywhere.  I've used a warrior macro that sets the range on "targetNearestDistance" to 5 yds so I don't waste time targeting mobs way across the screen.  <br>
<br>
This macro is alright, however, I thought that it would be so much easier if there was a simple macro or addon that would simply target the next closest mob say, 3 or 4 times (depending how many mobs you want to tank) and then go back to your first target.  Kind of the way "targetlasttarget" keybind works for two mobs except it targets next target until it gets to your set number of mobs then it "targetlasttarget" to your first target.<br>
<br>
Then, now matter how many of your tanked mobs, other people's mobs, and npc's are running around in a huge group about to be aoe'd to heck, you will always be certain that you will always be tab-targetting throught the same 4-5 mobs you started with.<br>
<br>
(Is my grammar ok for this post? Got banned before any feedback welcome)</div>

</div><br>
I'm partially going to reply to my own question:<br>
<br>
Say we're in a world in which you can never miss, but you can never crit either.<br>
<br>
Building 4 combo points requires:<br>
Mangle x1 + Shred x3<br>
<br>
Building 5 combo points requires:<br>
Mangle x1 + Shred x4<br>
<br>
Energy cost of a 4 point cycle =<br>
40 (Mangle) + 126(Shred) + 30 (Rip)<br>
= 196<br>
<br>
Energy cost of a 5 point cycle =<br>
40 (Mangle) + 168(Shred) + 30 (Rip)<br>
= 238<br>
<br>
196 and 238 can both be divided by 14, for a result of respectively 14 and 17.<br>
<br>
With the same amount of energy it takes to deal 17 times the 4 point combo cycle, we can deal 14 times the 5 point combo cycle.<br>
<br>
I used an excel sheet to work out the damage dealt by each cycle according to the Druid's AP.<br>
<br>
Here are the rounded numbers for 3000ap<br>
<br>
Normal	214<br>
Mangle	728<br>
Shred	1153<br>
Rip c4	1942<br>
Rip c5	2161<br>
<br>
Cycle C4 = 6130<br>
Cycle C5 = 7502<br>
C4 Damage over 3332 energy = 104k<br>
C5 Damage over 3332 energy = 105k<br>
<br>
I did the same calculations with other values of AP:<br>
<br>
4000ap<br>
C4 damage = 123k<br>
C5 damage = 123k<br>
<br>
5000ap<br>
C4 damage = 141k<br>
C5 damage = 141k<br>
<br>
6000ap<br>
C4 damage = 159k<br>
C5 damage = 159k<br>
<br>
<br>
Now obviously this would need to be done again by inputting the factors of Critrate and Hitrate, <b>but I think it quite interesting to notice that there is such a small difference between ripping at 4 combo points or ripping at 5 combo points.</b></div>

		<div id="post_message_602122">We always used 4 tanks (2 feral, 2 warriors) and had three group tanks and one MT/group tank. The MT picked up a single mob which was focused DPS'ed, then picked up a second mob as that got to ~20% which was then focused (generally abomination's were targetted first). It meant there was always a threat lead for that tank, and meant the rest of us could focus ourselves on the groups for AoE once 2-3 mobs were dead from focused DPS. <br>
<br>
4 tanks with a DPS warrior or even a holy paladin acting as the 4th made it so much quicker than trying to do it with just 3 "proper" tanks for us. Even one death loses you a lot more DPS than you lose by using a 4th tank, and it makes AoE'ing and other stuff so much quicker.<br>
<br>
One thing we found helped immensely on the trash in hyjal is thorns + retribution aura. If you have both it's ~50 damage per hit back on the mobs hitting you, and if they're improved (up to ~100 per hit) it helps even more. <br>
<br>
Another thing that helps is to turn nameplates on and stand still so they aren't shifting around constantly.<br>

				<strong>Dps Question-Should I be in the Melee group?</strong>

			<hr size="1" style="color:#FFFFFF">

		<!-- message -->
		<div id="post_message_602150">Throughout Hyjal our melee group consisted of me, two rogues, an enhancement shaman and a protection warrior with dps gear on those fights where no OT was necessary.  (We started to do Anetheron all out dps, without tanking the infernal for example). In this group I'd put out 1300-1400dps on most fights.  I got to tank, I got to be top 7-8 on many boss fights, it was great--everthing was peachy keen.<br>
<br>
Mid-way through black temple we got an uber combat rogue transfer and now the "whose gonna be the one booted out of the melee group" controversy began.  The three rogues do ~1700 dps, and of course you have to have the enhance shaman in the melee group.  So it became a toss up between me and the prot warrior on who gets the fifth spot.<br>
<br>
Now the prot warrior is an excellent player, has great dps gear and in the melee group puts out about 1.1k dps on many boss fights as pure prot spec. (So obviously he doesn't have Blood Frenzy (+4% melee damage) or improved battle shout.) And he has been taking that coveted fifth spot for the past few raids.<br>
<br>
Here's where recently I've kind of wanted to quit the game unfortunately.  I now get put in that fifth group where you stick that extra bad healer, extra bad caster, etc, where I receive not one single dps group buff.  <br>
<br>
My dps has gone from 1400+ to barely going over 1k dps sustained, and I feel like I'm literally contributing nothing to dps.<br>

Well, besides talking about my "feelings" (lol), my question is about the math behind non-improved battle shout, vs LotP.  Initially the melee group of the 3 combat rogues and enhancement shaman told my GM that 305 attack power &gt;&gt; 5% crit for this group, but the gm asked me to find out for sure.</div>

		<div id="post_message_602180">Hyjal waves are very doable with 2 prot warriors and a single feral - we did them just the other day with 2 ferals, a prot warrior, and 1 dps warrior in hybrid gear. (WWS - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302201807/http://wowwebstats.com/ylmz41fxdwt6c" target="_blank">WWS Loading...</a>) There are a few spots where you need to be constructive - and we often kept an abomination or 2 shackled for part of each wave until 1 or 2 of them had been burned down.<br>
 <br>
Remember that really, in the big scheme of things, the Ghouls and Crypt Fiends hit for very little - you should be able to tank 3-4 Ghouls and 2-3 Crypt Fiends without getting into that many problems. It's only once you start adding (multiple) Abominations that the damage input gets taxing.<br>
 <br>
[e] Just to back that point up here's an excerpt from that raid - bear in mind I'm not wearing what I would call full max armour max defense bear gear, more like 5 man tanking gear.<br>
 <br>
<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px">
	<div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom:0px"><img src="assets/code_html.gif" border="0"></div>
	<pre class="alt2" dir="ltr" style="
		margin: 0px;
		padding: 3px;
		border: 1px inset;
		width: 694px;
		height: 82px;
		text-align: left;
		overflow: auto">Actor       dmg in hits avg max
Abomination 371,199 623 595 4000
Ghoul       250,196 727 344 993
Crypt Fiend 175,516 557 315 949</pre>
</div>What you can see is the Abominations do nearly as much damage as the Ghouls and Crypt Fiends together, even though I take less than half the hits from them. <br>
 <br>
Also, remember, it's not the end of the world if the NPCs tank a little bit, just as long as you taunt off them in time to stop them dying - they will recharge hp to full so long as you get an out of combat break between waves.</div>

		<div id="post_message_602207">For rogues and enhancement shamen, 305 AP is probably going to be worth more than ~120 crit rating (about 5% crit).  The difference is really your DPS loss versus the DPS loss of the other tank, and the consideration of whether the extra 5k-20k healing per fight LOTP does is worth the difference.  <br>
<br>
Try to bring more things to the table for the group-- if you're a leatherworker, have (and use) drums frequently.  Use Tranquility as often as possible (still very effective even in feral gear).  If you're a jewelcrafter, make (and use) those half-hour buff necklaces, which make up the DPS gap.  <br>
<br>
The other alternative is convince your raid leader to put you with the hunter(s) and a spare resto shaman that can drop totems for you.  You'd lose Unleashed Rage, but gain a GoA totem.</div>

</div>I will definately do so Dukes ty, ultimately that will be the only way for me to justify myself in the melee group, but just for theorycrafting's sake, does anyone know off hand how much (ballpark percentage) would +305 attack power raise 3 combat rogues and one enhancement shaman versus 5% crit? (The 3 rogues and shaman have at least 3/6 T6 gear)<br>
<br>
I think for druids 14-15 attack power raises your dps by 1 approximately, but im sure this proportion varies with your typical BT combat rogue and enhancement shaman. <br>
<br>
My math shows that with LotP the melee group should have its total damage out increased by btw 2.5-3%. Probably closer to 3% because unleashed rage(shammy buff) scales with the increase in the group's crit.<br>
<br>
It's the +305 attack power's effect that I have trouble figuring out.</div>

		<div id="post_message_602396">I've tried to look into why the spreadsheet values hit so much, and couldn't find anything that stands out other than the way he determines his values. <br>
<br>
Toskk's has one slight defect that will cause it to undervalue hit (but not to the degree of the spreadsheet): it doesn't change your cycle time based on missed rips. For every avoided Rip, you have to wait at least another GCD (1 second), and probably an average of 1.5 energy ticks (2.25 seconds) to optimally re-start your cycle.  So if you have 10% of your rips avoided, the minimum possible average cycle time is around 12.22. <br>
<br>
Also, Toskk's determines his "average" cycle as averaging combo points, then finding the average of how many attacks you'd need.  This is fundamental in his approach to programming it and can't be "fixed".  The spreadsheet, on the other hand, looks at the individual probabilities of sequences of attacks landing.  I'm not sure this is creating the difference you see in the tools, however. <br>
<br>
The thing I noticed when using both tools is that the spreadsheet has significantly lower DPS when using unbuffed values; i.e., if you take a fully buffed druid's stats from the spreadsheet and put it into Toskk's calculator, you get similar end-DPS values; however, plug the unbuffed stats from the spreadsheet into Toskk's,  and the DPS it predicts is around 200 DPS different. <br>
<br>
Since they report markedly different values, a good starting point for picking one as the more accurate one would be to compare their predicted values of DPS at your current gear level-- i.e., if you are in catform on Shahraz and severely gimp your stats for shadow resist gear, try to find an attempt where you don't get teleported.  Take an attempt or two of a boss you have on farm, and test out how you do without a weapon equipped. <br>
<br>
I'll try to do this next time I get an opportunity.</div>

</div>For druids, it's 14 AP per character sheet DPS, BEFORE you account for special attacks.  In practice, you get 1 DPS from between 4 and 6 AP, depending on gear level. <br>
<br>
The rogue spreadsheet I have, which has a gear level of an early T6 rogue, shows a point of crit rating is worth about 1.75 AP.  Which puts 5% crit worth around 200 AP overall to them.  <br>
<br>
The shaman will not see much increased uptime on unleashed rage-- it's up nearly all the time the shaman is in combat.</div>

</div>I don't have the chart handy but I do recall looking at the math the other day. Without taking into account FB costing the full 35 energy on a miss/dodge it looked something like<br>
<br>
At 35 energy you need ~15k AP for Shred to be more DPE than FB<br>
at 40 energy you need ~6.7k AP for Shred to be more DPE than FB<br>
<br>
Taking the miss thing into account will lower those numbers somewhat, but they were also calculated with FB scaling at 0.15 dmg per AP whereas it may be 0.1666 (1/6) per AP (can anyone confirm the scaling of FB?). Either way at 35 energy its highly unlikely you'll ever get enough AP for Shred to be more worthwhile, whereas at 40-42 energy, if you're in top end gear fully buffed it MAY be better off to use Shred but either way it will be very close.</div>

</div>Spartakos hit this one dead on. The problem is that the WF dps gain for warriors is huge. We run with up to 3 dps warriors at times and even our top end rogues are getting pushed out into the tank or hunter groups. I've only been in the melee group once since starting T6 and that was on Archimonde to get tremor totem. I have to decurse on him now though. A 2-3 hunter/resto shaman group is quite nice for damage (though still not optimal).<br>

We've also recently switched to hunters kiting abominations to get the NPCs (instead of ghouls or fiends). This reduces the number needing to be tanked.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>The number of tanks basically determines how long the AoE needs to assist.  We typically have a dps warrior as an assist train, and have AoE single target assist with the melee for two, three, or (rarely) four targets, depending on how many tanks we have.  As a tank, what this lets me do is take my 4-8 mobs a bit away, spam swipe and switch targets with every maul or mangle.  After the assist targets are done, the melee finish off any other single target mobs, we pull the AoE packs together, and AoE begins.  We usually shackle an Abom or two, and whichever tank ends up with less extra Ghouls/Fiends/Felstalkers grabs them as soon as things settle down a bit.</div>

		<div id="post_message_605596">I was a little skeptical about taking maul out of my multi mob tanking macro and just using faire fire and swipe, but wow what a difference.  You guys were absolutely correct because even though I'd start out with 4-5 non-abomb  mobs on me, I was rage starving myself using maul+swipe as the mobs hit for so little and combined with a few lucky (rather unlucky) dodges I'd quickly spiral to near zero rage and i'd lose a mob to aoe.  <br>
<br>
@Boevis- thats an interesting point, I never considered asking to switch one of the rogues out of the melee group for myself.  I think someone posted that a competent rogue in the MT group with WF and GoA totem and myself in the melee group with the enh shaman would increase the total melee dps by almost ~100? (Not sure though)  Additionally we've just picked up a good MS warrior and he replaces the the prot (dps) warrior in the melee group, so LotP would benefit him more so.<br>
<br>
I really want to get into the melee group more often so I've leveled LW for the drums of battle just for that reason.  After using it I noticed the 80haste rating reduced my swing time by 5%. Off the top of my head considering most BT fights are ~6-8 mins long (xcept Illidan and council) thats say four uses per boss fight x30secs.  <br>
<br>
Considering about 65% of our rogues dps is from melee and 75% of our fury warriors dps is from melee+heroic strike (don't know about the enh shaman), how much would approximately 2mins of a +80 haste rating during a 8mins boss fight increase a rogues or fury warriors dps? Would it simple be 25% (2/8mins) x ~70%= 17.5% approx. increase in the total damage out for the rogues and warrior?<br>
<br>
Thx so much in advance, I'm doing anything I can to make a good case for me being in the melee group, as putting me in the melee group and sticking a rogue in the MT group is kind of a big deal drama-wise lol.</div>

		<div id="post_message_605873">It may be a rather minor correction, but in the guide you've listed high warlord najentus as having "quite a lot of magic damage".  This is completely untrue.  The only magic damage he deals is after his bubble is broken, 8500 to the raid.  that's a lot of damage to the raid, but very little, to the MT.<br>
<br>
For comparison, here's two WWS:  Tasonir's me, and Taggz is our warrior class lead and regular MT.<br>
<br>
Note that while I took considerably more damage, the fight was also over a minute longer (12000 raid dps vs 15000 raid dps), and I didn't have a helper warrior providing thunder clap.  Some of the dps difference I can't explain (aka, the warlock in first did over 100 dps more with a warrior tank, probably in a better group) but some is probably due to the lack of sunder armor, at least for the physical classes.  Correcting for these two things makes the damage much more even; but even so, taggz did take a fair amount less than I did.  Insert gripe about scaling of gear and lack of tanking items here.<br>

I would have provided more direct links but it seems that the WWS load time for unpaid accounts is currently 25 minutes.  In any case, 5% of the damage I took was magical, 95% was physical.  While warriors take slightly less from the magic, it's also worth noting that he did a fourth frost attack which I got a full resist on due to having the talent to avoid aoe attacks.</div>

</div>Because you're likely to have ~8 physical DPS (warriors, rogues, hunters, ret/prot pally, enh shaman, feral druid) it's far easier and beneficial to just have the "MT Group" be "DPS group 2" with a resto shaman in there.  You can have it be Hunterx2, Warrior, Druid, Shaman and the Shaman drops GoA/SoE, or if your hunters get put in a Spriests group and you have extra warriors then you put a rogue and something else in the MT group and shaman drops WF/SoE.<br>
<br>
My guild is quite melee heavy though we just lost our Enh shaman to college, our MT group is usually Feral, Warriorx2, Rogue, Shaman with DPS group being Feral, Roguex2, Warrior, Shaman.  Yes, we often have 2 ferals, I've broken 1500 on rage when the other one is tanking </div>

		<div id="post_message_606072">The few times I've gotten to DPS with another Druid tanking, I noticed that Mangle has a tendency to drop off a lot if the tank is the only one applying it, due to the typically low (or, lower at least) Hit Rating and having to contend with the high parry rate. Two missed Mangles in a row will seriously fuck up your rotation if no one else applies Mangle.<br>
<br>
Eventually, I got tired of attempting to monitor the tank's Mangle usage, and switched to the normal cycle. Later, I discovered pDebuffList/Demon, which I found immensely useful for stuff like this. At a glance you can tell if Mangle is on or not, and if you're about to cap energy (or if you've just Ripped): use Mangle. From what I understand, a non-Mangle'd Shred is pretty energy inefficient.<br>
<br>
But yeh, it's pretty cool when it's all going gravy and you don't have to use Mangle at all =p<br>

And eh, don't know if I am missing something, but none of the WWS shows you as tanking. In the first you are DPSing with Taggz and Windreaper tanking and in the second you are completely missing (with again, Taggz and Windreaper tanking).<br>

</div>Ah right, now that makes the post above look stupid. &lt;_&lt;<br>
<br>
Ah well, point still stands. There was a Warrior in the raid who didn't sunder? And the fact that you took more overall damage is as you said because the fight took longer but one thing that I found surprising is the fact that your max hit taken is slightly higher than that of the Warrior (6282 vs 6142) even though you'd expect it to be the other way around.</div>

Would  <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30106"><span><span class="purplename">[Belt of One-Hundred Deaths]</span></span></a> be a reasonably good tanking piece for a feral druid?<br>
<br>
It's about 620 less bear armor than  <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33583"><span><span class="purplename">[Waistguard of the Great Beast]</span></span></a>, but 25 expertise is a great threat AND mitigation stat.  There's equal agi on 100 deaths, with an 8agi and 4agi/6stam gem (for the socket bonus), and it'd be slightly better stam compared to a Great Beast with double 8-agi.<br>
<br>
Basically, I'm sure it's better if I'm armor capped without Great Beast (which I'm not quite at, since I've yet to see Hyjal/BT.  We just downed Kael for the first time yesterday).  But I'm not sure how effective the 25 expertise would be compared to the 620 armor.  I'd be around 32.5k with One-Hundred Deaths on instead of Great Beast.</div>

Ah well, point still stands. There was a Warrior in the raid who didn't sunder? And the fact that you took more overall damage is as you said because the fight took longer but one thing that I found surprising is the fact that your max hit taken is slightly higher than that of the Warrior (6282 vs 6142) even though you'd expect it to be the other way around.</div>

</div>Yeah, sorry about the indirect links.  I'd have posted better ones but the load was 25 minutes so I couldn't really reach them.<br>
<br>
I suspect the difference on max hits comes down to gear.  A warrior who takes a crushing blow on an odd chance should take significantly more than a druid taking one, but things like ironshield potions or 25% armor buffs from priests/shamans could easily cancel that out.  Honestly, I don't think druids will have a fair shot until we can get the full benefit from ironshields and other armor buffs, but there's no real room for that in the current system.  I'd be in favor of removing the armor cap, but that won't happen.<br>
<br>
As for the dps warrior not sundering, I assume he just never thought of it.  We generally use warrior tanks, and if not, a prot warrior is probably still sundering.  Naj is pretty hard on melee, so the prot warriors sat out for that fight.  Only the dps warrior was there, and I don't think he's used to maintaining sunder while dpsing.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">This idea just popped into my head today, and I had to come here and ask you guys who are actually good at this stuff:  <br>
Would  <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30106"><span><span class="purplename">[Belt of One-Hundred Deaths]</span></span></a> be a reasonably good tanking piece for a feral druid?<br>
<br>
It's about 620 less bear armor than  <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33583"><span><span class="purplename">[Waistguard of the Great Beast]</span></span></a>, but 25 expertise is a great threat AND mitigation stat.  There's equal agi on 100 deaths, with an 8agi and 4agi/6stam gem (for the socket bonus), and it'd be slightly better stam compared to a Great Beast with double 8-agi.<br>
<br>
Basically, I'm sure it's better if I'm armor capped without Great Beast (which I'm not quite at, since I've yet to see Hyjal/BT.  We just downed Kael for the first time yesterday).  But I'm not sure how effective the 25 expertise would be compared to the 620 armor.  I'd be around 32.5k with One-Hundred Deaths on instead of Great Beast.</div>

</div><br>
Yes, one hundred deaths works out as the best DPS belt, and one of the best tanking belts. The expertise reduction of possible burst damage outweights the armor loss, in my opinion.</div>

		<div id="post_message_607828">A rather interesting topic appeared on the EU druid forums a few days ago, which had me wondering for a while as well.<br>
<br>
Basicly it's about the difference in the crit chance on your character chart, and the actual crit chance reported by recount/wws etc. The actual value tends to be lower and I am wondering if this could be a bug, or a mechanic I am unfamiliar with.<br>
<br>
First of all we were looking at yellow hits, to avoid any difficulty with glancings (although they should not matter). Also, to work around the effect of a 2-roll system, misses/dodges etc are disregarded. So, we're only looking at the actual hit vs crit %. <br>
<br>
Now I can think of one thing that could cause a lower crit chance, and that would be the increased defense of a raidboss vs a player. <br>
<br>
My question is the following: Has anybody got any large data samples of fight with the same amount of crit chance (iow, no gearchanges/buff changes/setup changes that would alter your crit chance) <br>
<br>
With a large enoug sample size, we can filter out the effects of luck, and perhaps figure out what is causing this consistent lower crit chance.</div>

		<div id="post_message_608208"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->From my current understanding of combat mechanics, for single roll attacks (white hits) the weapon skill to defense disparity between a player and boss mob should only result in -0.6% crit [0.04 (anticrit per defense) * 5 (defense per level) * 3 (level difference)].<br>
<br>
For two roll attacks (yellow damage) as onkl said, miss/dodge will reduce observed crit value.<br>
<br>
So if your chance to crit is 40%, and you have 5% chance to miss and the boss has 5.6% chance to dodge, your actual crit rate on yellow attacks will be:<br>
<br>
89.4% of specials will land<br>
of those, 40% will crit<br>
So your observed crit chance should be: 35.76% across all attacks<br>
<br>
If you were hit capped with no Expertise:<br>
94.4% of specials will land<br>
Observed crit chance: 37.76%<br>
<br>
If you were hit capped with 5 Expertise:<br>
95.65% of specials will land<br>
Observed crit chance: 38.26%<br>

</div>We wouldn't be able to clip LotP off, because like pallies, that would cause the rest of our party to lose the buff as well.<br>
You're right though, that would make testing extremely easy.<br>
I'm not certain if other classes can click it off or not, but I'd venture the guess that they can't.<br>

Also, all copies of the game are (unless I'm ignorant to some extraneous factor) exactly the same, so European or not, the builds are all the same.<br>

<br>
Dont pay attention to ctprofiles stats... they are waaay off.  The stats I posted reflect the correct values when 10man raid buffed.<br>
<br>
Rawr seems to say that going with Option A is better for mitigation.  Due to the fact that Option B gets me 2pS3 gear (which is great for dps and is gem'd/enchanted for dps) I do output 60-100 more TPS on average using Option B.<br>
<br>
And before you say anything, I am aware that using a 12 def enchant on my bracers is better point allocation then a 12 stam one.  I'm also aware that some of my gear is lacking enchants (working on that)<br>
<br>
My question is: <br>
<br>
Which would you wear, why, and which slots would you swap out with badge/honor/arena gear?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I got a gear upgrade and at the same time bought a good stack of agi pots, with the good intention of using those to test how a notable, 5% increase affects the results.<br>

My crit rate at 41,2% yielded an actual crit rate of 35,9% (delta 5,3%) with a sample size of 1715 mangles and shreds.<br>

</div>The staff is a good upgrade over Terestrian's. Hit-rating is overrated by many druids, at no gear level is it better than agility and at the T4-level it also not as good as strength. The fact that a missed Mangle or Shred only costs 20% of the normal energy cost and that most of our damage comes from specials rather than white attacks, makes it easy to see why hit rating is not as good for Druids as it is for other melee classes.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>In practice I think it's going to be greater than a 20% DPS loss. A lot of TBC fights involve a great deal of mobility for melee classes. If you miss your final Rip before a ground stomp from Gruul, or before running out to click a cube in the Magtheridon fight, or maybe missing a Shred before being hit by the static charge in Vashj and having to run out then you will lose more than 20% because you would have ended up with 100 energy before going back in, whether or not that special attack had used full or partial energy.<br>
<br>
I'm not sure where exactly I would put +hit in the scheme of things, but it's easy enough to hit the 142 cap (at least if you're in T4 content) while only sacrificing one or two gem slots for it. I use my DPS set for tanking Leo - although I change out one of my rings for the <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30834" target="_blank">[Shapeshifter's Signet]</a>. Staying hit-capped let's me just do this without worrying about toting around even more spare armor pieces. 3+ sets of armor is already too much.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_610436"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->As a feral druid attempting to gear up for a tanking role, I would appreciate a little bit of guidance. I know the top priority is to get immune to critical hits, followed by "decent" armor/hp/dodge values. However, I'm not really sure what "decent" counts as. <br>
<br>
Rawr has two seperate values, mitigation (armor + avoidance) and survival (which I think is: hitpoints + mitigation, assuming no heals?), and mentions that after achieving enough hitpoints to not be killed by burst damage one should focus on mitigation. Would that be something along the lines of 15,000HP (unbuffed) for T4 level? What about T5 and T6?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_610562"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Through the course of TBC I've aimed for these in order when deciding between gear choices:<br>
<br>
1) uncrittable<br>
2) 30k armor<br>
3) 15k unbuffed HP in bear form (not counting Tauren racial)<br>
4) avoidance<br>
<br>
in that priority, on the count of both available itemization and what's needed in the various tiers of gear. Of course, even after 2 and 3, I'd take a good chunk of either over 1-2% more avoidance, but those would be my baseline estimates before I even started worrying about getting more dodge.<br>
<br>
I feel it's a lot more straightforward than warrior/paladin itemization, because in most cases, there exists only one item of debatably best value in each slot, in each tier. However, if itemization provides a close decision between the three, go for stam and armor.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Yes, it's true.  Both the elemental sharpening stone and weightstones introduced in TBC work for Ferals.  However, in the case of the weighstones only the crit rating will apply...the blunt weapon damage will do nothing.  They are a nice boost to crit, though finding a old school blacksmith to craft the Elemental Sharpening Stones might be a bitch because I'm pretty sure that's a MC drop.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>That is because expertise is *exactly* as good as hit rating.<br>
<br>
15.77 hitrating reduces your chance to miss by 1%.<br>
15.77 expertise rating reduces your chance to be dodged by 1%.<br>
<br>
Obviously, when you're in front of a boss and parry becomes relevant the story changes, but for normal DPS purposes: expertise rating ~ hit rating.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Just to clarify why I need this, I'm working on replacing my bear-tanking belt and boots. Right now I have <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=29264" target="_blank">[Tree-Mender's Belt]</a> and <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30674" target="_blank">[Zierhut's Lost Treads]</a>. I can replace the belt with either <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30042" target="_blank">[Belt of Natural Power]</a> or <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33879" target="_blank">[Vindicator's Dragonhide Belt]</a>, and I can replace the boots with either <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30041" target="_blank">[Boots of Natural Grace]</a> or <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33880" target="_blank">[Vindicator's Dragonhide Boots]</a>.<br>
<br>
If I get the Vindicator's gear, that means I can replace other slots (namely, my neck) with DPS/stamina gear, since defense can be taken away due to the resilience. At this point my mental theorycraft ability goes to pot, and I start to wish for an accurate calculator. <br>

With the choker I will lose ~20 AP (3430ish to 3411) and 1% crit(48% to 47%) don't remember my base crit and AP this is with some raid buffs). **But** the choker plus the ZA staff (which I have) are 490 Armor Penetration and seems to me might be worth the AP and crit loss.<br>

If one had to choose between 15.4k HP and 38% dodge, versus 13.1k HP and 45% dodge (all self-buffed, no consumables) for off tanking in SSC and TK (with minor maintanking here and there), and some main tanking in Kara/ZA, which would you choose? Common wisdom says stack life first, but my bear guildies have repeatedly suggested stacking dodge via agility first (and will probably kill me when they see this message), and they do pretty damn well as tanks as far as I can tell.<br>

</div>There is a point where you have enough health which is basically the amount you need to survive the worst case hit/crush combo without counting on avoidance.<br>
I'd say there is no "enough" avoidance in terms of mitigation ever if you keep a healthy amount of health, you might want to stop gearing for avoidance if this puts a dent on your TPS though.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Erm. It's a pretty silly thing to do just for the hell of it, especially when blue/epic gems are involved. Let's take a look.<br>
 <br>
Now he has:-<br>
 <br>
21 agility<br>
9 hit<br>
8 ap (socket bonus)<br>
 <br>
If he did what you suggest<br>
 <br>
28 agi<br>
0 hit<br>
4 ap (from 2 str socket bonus)<br>
 <br>
Even weighting agi very very high vs hit/str you end up being basically equal. If you used epic gems it would end up being an improvement yes, but the crimson spinels are not exactly overflowing out of most guild banks.<br>
 <br>
Plus I suspect that set up is quite deliberate as it's exactly hit-capped. But your mileage will of course vary with regards to hit capping.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

If you don't want to do that, just refer to what I edited in my previous post: If you can survive the worst case raid buffed in the dodge set, then by all means, go with that.

		<div id="post_message_611118"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->My biggest problem right now is that my chest and pants are sort of geared for agility-stacking, rather than general tanking. I'm wearing Shadowprowler's Chestguard and Skulker's Greaves, specifically--great for agillty, not so great for stamina (ignoring gemming at the moment). I have no chance of getting T4 anymore (Gruul and Mag have been dropped from the rotation, so I have to either wait for a PuG or forget it), and T5 is a long way off for me at this time.<br>
<br>
(edit: ugh figuring out gear is harder than the actual gearing  )<br>
<br>
(edit 2) Alright, new question that might help me figure it out.<br>
<br>
What's the absolute worst-case damage-wise at the T5 level? In other words, if dodge completely fails and I get whacked by big-hitters somehow all at once (WF proc on Tidalvess, Prince thrash, two simultaneous Al'ar add explosions, whatever), leaving me to only count on my armor and health, how much health should I have to survive? What's going to hit me the hardest? (I suspect Tidalvess WF procs, and maybe Morogrim's normal-attacks-like-a-fucking-freight-train, but there're others I just haven't thought of I'm sure).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>The 15.5k health on the Armory is erroneous, it should be 13.5k. I don't know where that 2000 health is coming from, maybe I still have fort or a food buff and the armory's glitched out. Wouldn't be the first time. vOv<br>
<br>
That said, the belt and boots are what I was looking at replacing in today's theorycraft with Rawr. I was thinking of replacing the boots with, as you said, <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30041" target="_blank">[Boots of Natural Grace]</a>, but replacing the belt with <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33879" target="_blank">[Vindicator's Dragonhide Belt]</a> so I can replace the +15 resilience to chest with +6 stats, as well as some other +def gems if I can (which is where the +sta vs +agi posts above came from).<br>
<br>
<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33579" target="_blank">[Vestments of Hibernation]</a> don't look too bad, though.<br>

(edit) Or maybe <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30042" target="_blank">[Belt of Natural Power]</a> and <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33880" target="_blank">[Vindicator's Dragonhide Boots]</a> instead, though getting the vortices would be kind of a PITA.

Nothing is more infuriating than watching 2-3 mangles in a row being parried/dodged etc.<br>

Dropping Pendant of the Titans and Wildfury for Deftness + Earthwarden is a significant cut in dodge stamina, and aggro generation (through AP).  But is it worth it to get that expertise?  <br>

1) Get leatherworking to 375 (at 367 right now, so I guess I need to just crank out some Drums of Battle or something), and craft <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30041" target="_blank">[Boots of Natural Grace]</a> to replace <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30674" target="_blank">[Zierhut's Lost Treads]</a>.<br>
2a) Collect badges for <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33579" target="_blank">[Vestments of Hibernation]</a> to replace <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33204" target="_blank">[Shadowprowler's Chestguard]</a>.<br>
2b) Gather mats, and start rolling on vortices, for our resident plan-holder to craft <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30042" target="_blank">[Belt of Natural Power]</a>.<br>
3) Replace my <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=18834" target="_blank">[Insignia of the Horde]</a> with a <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28239" target="_blank">[Medallion of the Horde]</a>, because seriously jesus fuck five minutes is too long.<br>
4) Get <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33881" target="_blank">[Vindicator's Dragonhide Bracers]</a> to replace <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32814" target="_blank">[Veteran's Leather Bracers]</a> (and by the way, I got the rogue bracers instead of the druid bracers because I'm sort of dumb). Extremely minor upgrade, but hey.<br>

		<div id="post_message_611496">Hello all, I wanted to pose a question to all you great theory crafters out there regarding 5/5 Feral Aggression to get opinions on it for a few use scenarios:<br>
<br>
1. Ferocious Bite (1.15%) on bleed immune mobs i.e. Void Reaver, Undead in Kara, etc<br>
    (I recall someone posting that you shouldn't never use FB with more than ~30 energy even on bleed immune mobs, to the effect stating don't use your combo points at all just keep mangle shred cycling, do we agree this is best?)<br>
2. Demo Roar AP reduction benefit for Main Tanks vs. Thick Hide<br>
3. PVP applications of FB, against high resilience opponents<br>
<br>
If I should start a new thread to discuss this please let me know; or if this is appropriate place, any commentary would be greatly apprecatied.</div>

		<div id="post_message_611583">1) Yes, ferocious bite is worth is on bleed immune bosses, providing you have low energy. If you were to take the talent, it would make it more worth it (especially if you have the 4t6 bonus). The only problem with this is, what do you drop from the rest of the talents? Assuming you take <a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?talent=0ZxhGsfboezioVx0z" target="_blank">this</a> as the base build, where do you spend the 8 points? I would normally say natural shapeshifter, savage fury, brutal impact and one "free" point (probably in reflection, or maybe all of reflection or primal tenacity instead of brutal impact too). All these are optional, but I would say that, at a glance, savage fury will add more overall damage to your build than feral instincts, per point, even if you use ferocious bite every time. Most people won't take it just because it uses too many points for too slim a gain.<br>
<br>
2) A warriors demo shout is about as powerful <i>at base level</i> as fully improved demo roar (<a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?search=demor" target="_blank">proof</a> - they get a rank of demo shout at 70 and we're left with the level 62 version). It's just not worth the point investment if you have one regular warrior, and that aspect is completely wasted if you have a warrior with improved demo shout in the raid.<br>
<br>
3) No idea - someone else can answer it or you can try the PvP sub-forum.</div>

</div>3 points of improved demo roar is just slightly better than the base warrior version -- and will keep the base warrior version from going up.  <br>
<br>
Base druid is 248 AP reduction.  <br>
3 points is 307.5.<br>
5 points is 347.2.<br>
Base warrior is 300 AP reduction.<br>
2 point is 348 AP.  <br>
5 point is 420 AP.<br>
<br>
IIRC, other theorycraft is that mobs have about ~340AP.  Barring curse of recklessness, I think 2 points for a warrior or 5 points for a druid removes pretty much all the mobs AP.<br>
<br>
But yeah, warrior is better for raiding.  But if you have no warriors with improved demo shout, a druid can usefully get a higher benefit than a warrior's base level with 5 ranks.<br>
 <br>
<br>
How to find 5 points free to do that is another problem.<br>
<br>
(Edited because I had the wrong base value since I mistaken assumed thot would be accurate.)</div>

I've got 3/5 points in feral aggression, mainly for the improvement to demo roar.  It doesn't hurt for bleed immune bosses or trash either, but I can verify that it does in fact keep non-talented warrior shouts off.  Only one tank in my guild (of 3 warriors) has improved demo shout, actually.  Quite surprised to hear that it's 297.6AP, as I had just assumed it was slightly over 300 on account of it beating a warrior's shout.<br>
<br>
Anyways, as a high end raider with no interest in pvp, Brutal Impact is right out.  Just about everything's stun immune anyways.  3 talent points isn't worth 10 rage from Intensity, and my mana doesn't run out in feral forms anyways.  I don't powershift as much as I should, so natural shapeshifter wouldn't help me much either.  I realize gaining even 10 energy is probably around 400-500ish damage (just off the top of my head estimate) but doing it about 10 more times with the talent is around 4k-5k damage, which is around 1.5% more damage.  Rough figures and all that, but it just doesn't appeal to me.  <br>
<br>
With that said, you might as well take the whole feral tree and dump the last 3 into feral aggression.<br>

</div>Considering it's near-instant now, if you aren't powershifting, yes, you're underestimating it.  Just shoot for below 10 energy when you do it, otherwise you may possibly lose energy.<br>

Just look at the Travelform code in Itemrack - it's easy enough to copy/paste/edit Flight Form as an option into Itemrack using the in-game gui. I added mine when Flight Form was introduced so I've no idea if it's added by default now.<br>

</div>In my experience Brutal Impact is useful enough to be worth taking, even if limited. Although I've considered dropping Natural Shapeshifter there are some encounters where it's been indispensible - prime examples are Morogrim shifting between dps and offtank-shepherding Murlocs or healing myself after a grave. Illidan phase 4 (I'm FR tank) I just stay in caster and keep myself and the Warlock's Felhound alive which is two less jobs for the raid healers to think about. I suppose it all depends on your playstyle, but I've almost run myself out of mana on occasion and always carry Mana Pots to every raid.</div>

</div>I have experienced this myself. At first I thought it was wierd, but assumed it was just several random damage enhancing buffs that happened at the same time, like BM Hunters Ferocious Inspiration, Survival Hunters Expose Weakness, random proc trinkets and Shamans Unleashed Rage.<br>
<br>
However, after doing the math, I don't think that even this can push Rip damage that high. However, if we assume that the Mangle Debuff somehow would be counted twice for one Rip, then the math seems correct. (~540 * 1.3 * 1.3 = ~900)<br>
<br>
*edit* *edit again, rip is 6 ticks, yes?*<br>
According to wowwiki, rank 7 Rip damage is Attack Power * 0,24 + 1092. So to achieve ticks of 900 with Mangle only counted once, you would need: <br>
( 900*6 - 1092 ) / 0,24 / 1,3 = 13807 AP<br>
( TickDamage * NrOfTicks - 1092 ) / Rip AP Modifier / Mangle Bonus<br>
<br>
I hope my math is correct, but I think I messed up somewhere.</div>

</div>I know what it is... It's a mange bug it was from the version 2.0<br>
Some times you can get double mangle bonus on bleeds (damaga*1.3*1.3)<br>
<br>
To look like it works best way to see - go skettis and find elite trees go bear form and:<br>
1) make 5x lacerates and write down the bleeed damage number<br>
2) add mangle look it = damage*1.3<br>
3) wait it all wears off and now add mangle and wait until it 2-0.5 sec left for mangle debuff to wear off and now start lacereting get 5x lacerates and WOOT no mangle debuff but it tics for (damage*1.3) now add mangle and WOOOOT (damage*1.3*1.3)<br>
<br>
To have it you must be the only druid so mangle debuff can wear off, in cat you can some times see this bug becouse of rip GCD mangle - standart damage order, if in next 12 sec you get 4-5combo and right after rip end add new rip (it's in time 1sec before mangle wears off, and for some unknown reason server resume count it in damage even it ended) you add new mangle and have rip = (damage*1.3*1.3)<br>
<br>
last time in ZA i have this bug two times in order =) (becouse of lucky on crits and OOC and T4 set bonus so can get 70energy + 5combo in 12sec)</div>

		<div id="post_message_612358">Well I guess it really is personal preference and perception. I like Brutal Impact in PvE, Hyjal caster trash comes to mind immediately, actually a lot of areas come to mind where I find it handy. Also, in my opinion, reducing mana costs for shape shifting isn't just for power shifting. I find myself shifting a lot to get out of snares, picking up trash, charging back to a boss, going travel form (obviously outdoors), etc. <br>
<br>
I would also ask that unless you are MT'ng with no Warriors (you have at least 1) that have Imp. Demo Shout what good would an improved Demo Roar be? If you are OT I guess it could come in handy in limited situations where your mob might be up long enough for it to be of use. But if you are in cat form for DPS then you'd have to swap back and forth to apply the Roar and that would be very inefficient and plain silly.<br>
<br>
Not arguing, just trying to understand your logic.<br>

<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304060253/http://www.wowarmory.com/character-talents.xml?r=Blackhand&amp;n=Tasonir" target="_blank">The World of Warcraft Armory</a><br>
<br>
I've got 3/5 points in feral aggression, mainly for the improvement to demo roar.  It doesn't hurt for bleed immune bosses or trash either, but I can verify that it does in fact keep non-talented warrior shouts off.  Only one tank in my guild (of 3 warriors) has improved demo shout, actually.  Quite surprised to hear that it's 297.6AP, as I had just assumed it was slightly over 300 on account of it beating a warrior's shout.<br>
<br>
Anyways, as a high end raider with no interest in pvp, Brutal Impact is right out.  Just about everything's stun immune anyways.  3 talent points isn't worth 10 rage from Intensity, and my mana doesn't run out in feral forms anyways.  I don't powershift as much as I should, so natural shapeshifter wouldn't help me much either.  I realize gaining even 10 energy is probably around 400-500ish damage (just off the top of my head estimate) but doing it about 10 more times with the talent is around 4k-5k damage, which is around 1.5% more damage.  Rough figures and all that, but it just doesn't appeal to me.  <br>
<br>
With that said, you might as well take the whole feral tree and dump the last 3 into feral aggression.<br>
<br>
Am I underestimating powershifting in 2.3?</div>

</div>Also be aware that the reverse can happen.  If you apply mangle on a target, very shortly after the current mangle debuff expires, it can sometimes ignore the mangle bleed effects bonus and just do damage equal to an un-mangled rip.  Re-applying mangle whilst the current rip is ticking won’t alter its damage in anyway (same applies with the 1.3*1.3 rip bonus mentioned earlier), but your new rip once your current rip has expired should behave normally, whether or not there is a mangle debuff on the target.  This altercation doesn’t affect shred in anyway.</div>

Brutal Impact is actually quite nice, even in PVE. I wouldn't really want to ditch it just for Feral Aggression. According to current mob theories of attack power (as mentioned in a previous post), putting points above 3 is pointless, and 3 just gives you a debuff very marginally better than Shout and one that you won't always be putting up unless you're willing to shift into Bear while DPSing. The Ferocious Bite part of it doesn't exactly inspire either, it might raise the energy at which it's worthwhile to Ferocious Bite by a few points. I may look at the math for it at some point today, time permitting.</div>

If you are OT I guess it could come in handy in limited situations where your mob might be up long enough for it to be of use. But if you are in cat form for DPS then you'd have to swap back and forth to apply the Roar and that would be very inefficient and plain silly.<br>

</div>Purely anecdotal, but coming from someone who has actually maintanked with 3/5 in Imp. Demo Roar, it really isn't worth it. I was able to drop 2 points into Savage Fury and pick up a point in Primal Tenacity by doing so and with my current gear Mangle is ~15% of my damage on bosses, so for 2 points I see a 3% dps increase plus some fear and stun resist. It also allows for faster soloing since Mangle is the weapon of choice. <br>
<br>
Since my respec, I have not missed it at all, I simply tell the warriors to put theirs up (I used to, since I had the improved) and I gain a GCD every ~30 seconds which is nice, especially for bosses like Morogrim where every attack counts.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I know what it is... It's a mange bug it was from the version 2.0<br>
Some times you can get double mangle bonus on bleeds (damaga*1.3*1.3)<br>
<br>
To look like it works best way to see - go skettis and find elite trees go bear form and:<br>
1) make 5x lacerates and write down the bleeed damage number<br>
2) add mangle look it = damage*1.3<br>
3) wait it all wears off and now add mangle and wait until it 2-0.5 sec left for mangle debuff to wear off and now start lacereting get 5x lacerates and WOOT no mangle debuff but it tics for (damage*1.3) now add mangle and WOOOOT (damage*1.3*1.3)<br>
<br>
To have it you must be the only druid so mangle debuff can wear off, in cat you can some times see this bug becouse of rip GCD mangle - standart damage order, if in next 12 sec you get 4-5combo and right after rip end add new rip (it's in time 1sec before mangle wears off, and for some unknown reason server resume count it in damage even it ended) you add new mangle and have rip = (damage*1.3*1.3)<br>
<br>
last time in ZA i have this bug two times in order =) (becaose of lucky on crits and OOC and T4 set bonus so can get 70energy + 5combo in 12sec)</div>

</div>Can someone reexplain this double mangle bonus again? I have a friend that swears he can somewhat consistently get the mangle bonus to double up on his rips during long boss encounters. <br>

		<div id="post_message_613100">The trick is to apply rip in the last second of the old mangle, then reapply mangle before the frist rip tick. This is very possible as rip ticks every 2 seconds, and cat form has a 1 second gcd.<br>
<br>
The entire rip is then affected by both the old mangle and the new mangle.<br>
<br>
N.B. You can reapply mangle later and all subsequent rip/lacerate ticks will be affected, but since the main use of this trick is to boost your dps, the best option is to use it as soon as possible.</div>

Enhancement shamans increase feral dps by more than probably anyone else due to our weapons consisting of entirely attack power. Also having a survival hunter, ms warrior, curse of recklessness and to a lesser degree a ret paladin are all major buffs. Another common factor is mastering powershifting and your rotations along with gearing yourself up correctly. I think 2000dps on a short fight such as gorefiend is certainly possible once you finish your gear set and get all these buffs. It should be possible now with a mangle bot and a short enough fight.</div>

</div>I've been recently thinking the same thing, questioning the 2pc T6 vs 2pc T4.  I find that I end up clipping about half of my T4 procs off to nothingness due to powershifting.  I've gotten the general feeling from this thread along with my personal experience that 2pc T4 is very very strong, but the rate at which I clip off the 20 energy really aggravates me.  It seems the only set bonuses people argue are 2pc T4 vs 4pc T6, but how does the 2pc T4 stack up against 2pc T6, especially when you factor in the loss of the usefulness of T4 when powershifting?</div>

</div>I do, regularly.  Admittedly I'm a raid leader, so I spoil myself on those "I get to do DPS?!? YAY!" fights.  Of course, we lost our Enh Shaman to School, so the past month has been very morose for us melee.<br>
<br>
This is my last recorded Teron, iirc I was in MT Group, so WF/SoE, Shout, BoK, BoM were my buffs.<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304064926/http://wowwebstats.com/aybxw2uoh6zdq?s=1855-2094&amp;a=13#abilities" target="_blank">Boevis - WWS</a><br>
<br>
Recently I've switched to 4T6 and powershifted more, but Teron was unkind and I got debuffed first (I suppose I should call that kind, since I'm apparently one of the best at Ghost).  Overall I doubt I'll be going back to 2t4 unless I manage to get DST and Madness, haste and armor pen with less AP clearly favors everything but Rip in our DPS, especially procs.  I will say, as far as 4T6 goes, seeing "double Mangled" rip tics for over 1000 really made my week, if I could reliably reproduce this every cycle, I'd contemplate ripping with 3 cps sometimes.  It's freakish when fully buffed seeing no numbers below 1k for a 6 second string of white crit, specials, and bugged rip.</div>

</div>- I saw the choker twice, once going to a rogue and once to a shaman, and not planning on getting it myself anyway. The kael neck is a very very slight upgrade over both Haramads (which I effectively got for "free") and the choker anyway. Having only killed Kael 4-5 times (keying) and having priority on the neck for healers, there wasn't any point in me thinking about changing my neck.<br>
- I saw the belt twice, once to a rogue and once to a hunter, and never wanted it as my setup is already very good for someone not priority on DPS loot (looking to upgrade a trinket, maybe upgrade the weapon, and that's about it).<br>
- I never saw the madness drop in 4 months of farming illidan (with 100% raid attendance). I would've preferred the trinket from ZA (<a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33831"><span><span class="purplename">[Berserker's Call]</span></span></a>) over the madness anyway, as the hit rating would be completely wasted. Not to mention we only ever had 1 dragonspine drop, and saw 3 tsunami's over the entire course of doing SSC which means every melee was looking to upgrade their melee trinkets, and being (primarily) a tanking character I had less priority anyway. We also never saw the Gurtogg tanking trinket drop, but we did see the Skull of Guldan about 8 times which I suppose makes up for it in some meager way.<br>
- I probably would've swapped Everbloom for the Idol of Terror too (iirc I farmed the badges for both the idol and the brooch of deftness pre-2.3).<br>
<br>
As stated previously, I stopped playing just prior to 2.3, so all of this is a moot point really.<br>
<br>
Surely the last page of posts explains the mechanic behind the double rip perfectly enough? Wait until mangle is on but rip isn't (the last 1-2 seconds of the debuff), then rip, then wait for mangle to run out and then put on a new mangle. The rip gets the benefit of both the initial mangle and the new one. I'm not sure if this is a "perfect" bug where it always happens, or if it's dependant on client/server lag interaction and will only happen some of the time.<br>
<br>
Edit: We used a loot council btw, so taking items that were useful for melee DPS just because I wanted to and had the DKP wasn't an option.</div>

		<div id="post_message_613859">I have more question with a potentially obvious answer. I've been plotting my gear upgrade path for both cat and bear and I've come to the conclusion that cat is a lot easier to do this for. Anytime I consider an upgrade for tanking, I have to reevaluate the rest of my gear and ensure that I have not dipped below crit immunity. I have been using RAWR for ranking various gear pieces against one another in hopes of finding ones that are definitely "better" than what I have now so I can have a few target items to go after.

</div>I made this post in a thread quite a while back about crit immunity I believe most of it still applies:<br>
<br>
Lets do some math here:<br>
<br>
We need 2.6% anti crit to be crit immune.<br>
<br>
39.4 Resilience gives 1% crit reduction<br>
2.4 Def Rating grants 1 Def Skill -&gt; 1 Def Skill gives 0.04% crit reduction<br>
<br>
Sources of crit reduction everyone should have:<br>
Veteran's Bracers: These are ideal since there is nothing else that really fits this slot. Gives 17 Resilience.<br>
Helm Enchant: 16 Def rating.<br>
Shoulder enchant: Aldor = 10 Def rating, Scryer = 15 Def Rating<br>
Total = 0.8648 % crit reduction low end for aldor<br>
<br>
We therefore need 1.7352 % more<br>
The enchants to chest/bracers seem like the next best place to add crit reduction. All combat ratings have a 1.000 Stat value as do all stats but Sta which has a 0.667 Stat value. Therefore, exchanging 6 Sta and 6 Agi for 15 resilience gives us better item budget value as does exchanging 12 Sta for 12 Defense. Therefore:<br>
Enchant Chest: 15 Resilience<br>
Enchant Bracers: 12 Defense Rating<br>
= 0.5807 % crit reduction<br>
Total: 1.4455%, 1.1545% remaining<br>
<br>
Rings/Necklaces<br>
The heroic badge necklace is pretty similar to most of the neck pieces available to us for tanking. Further they all have roughly the same Defense Rating on them so adding that we have:<br>
22 Defense rating (Juggernaut as an example)<br>
Take the Kara Exalted Ring and the Mag's Head ring and we get another 39 Defense rating. Note: upgrading to the Band of the Abyssal Lord or other non-armor rings, results in either no loss of Defense rating or a gain of it.<br>
61 Defense Rating = 1.01666% crit reduction<br>
Total: 2.4622% crit reduction, only 0.1378 remaining.<br>
<br>
0.1378 Requires either 9 Def Rating or 6 Resilience rating to get (less if you're a scryer since you have an extra 5 Defense rating). With such a small amount left almost any good tanking cloak will have the required Defense ratings. In fact a cloak with over 21 Defense rating will allow you to enchant your bracers with Sta again. This also leaves all your tier slots, your trinkets and your belt/boots free to use whatever you want in them without needing to worry about crit immunity. Another option at this point is to get a single 8 resilience gem (or one of the 5 defense/6 sta ones if you're scryer) and that leaves a slot open between neck/cloak/rings that also doesnt need defense on it (Necklace of the Deep instead of a defense neck for example).</div>

I tank a lot of trash in MH, but we have a prot pally, so its basically Shadowy Necros, so most damage is spellcasts.  In BT we rarely need me to provide that much (Even the prot pally is over 20k health).  So I tend to aim for not being crit against trash mobs and just in case let the above elixir make up the difference.</div>

All of those are upgrades for you IMO (although the belt arguably so - it makes up a huge chunk of crit immunity, but loses a small number of stats and ~600 armour compared to Natural Power). All are relatively easy to get, although both Timelapse and the Veteran's bits require a bit of grinding. You should be able to pick up the cloak and neck pretty easily if you're doing kara though.

Should start using that Elixir of Ironskin more. Made a Hybrid set, which basically consists of some stamina trinkets and enough DPS gear w/ resilience to not get critted, but that'd make a fair bit of a difference. It's not like the Elixir of Major Fortitude has a major impact.</div>

		<div id="post_message_614302">I've been gaming, just not playing WoW. Farming Illidan for 4 months meant WoW started to drag rather a lot (especially as I didn't PvP other than to get upgrades for PvE gear, which I disliked the idea of in the first place), and a lot of my friends decided the same so a lot of us quit as Team Fortress 2 and quite a few other things came out. I've been playing TF2 and Eve mostly, and had quite a lot of fun, just kept up with most of WoW just because of this thread. There really doesn't seem to be much happening atm, and I'm kind of glad that I didn't keep playing because I think I'd just be very depressed at how long Sunwell is taking to come out.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Yeah, the Elixir of Ironskin is a very good option for getting crit immunity. I just don't (didn't) like using consumables for things like that (I'd rather it be an advantage than something that is standard for a particular set of gear). If you're only slightly short you could use a Flask of Fort instead, although that may be going over the top when you could use a resillience gem instead of something and have Major Fort + Major Agi.</div>

Rip is ~(1500 dmg + 0.25*Ap)*1.1*1.3*1.04 (for a 5 point rip, despite what the tooltip says).<br>
<br>
806 per tick gives 4836 damage. That means his AP needs to be: 7007 (. Unless I'm missing another multiplier somewhere this seems unreasonably high. The report seems too late for the darkmoon buff to be active but that would explain the high numbers throughout it (and only require ~ 5800 AP to make those kind of rip ticks). Either that or he has perfected the art of getting double mangled rips going which would also bring the numbers down more reasonably.</div>

<br>
Rip is ~(1500 dmg + 0.25*Ap)*1.1*1.3*1.04 (for a 5 point rip, despite what the tooltip says).<br>
<br>
806 per tick gives 4836 damage. That means his AP needs to be: 7007 (. Unless I'm missing another multiplier somewhere this seems unreasonably high. The report seems too late for the darkmoon buff to be active but that would explain the high numbers throughout it (and only require ~ 5800 AP to make those kind of rip ticks). Either that or he has perfected the art of getting double mangled rips going which would also bring the numbers down more reasonably.</div>

</div>After T5 level gear, survival really is easy, so personally I believe mixing in threat production is pretty important. Here are a couple of piecces I recommand picking up:<br>
<br>
Neck: Pendant of the Titans (If you have the defense already, Brooch of Deftness from badge vendor will work)<br>
Back: Pepe's Shroud of Pacification<br>
Ring: Band of the Abyssal Lord<br>
<br>
As for heroic badge reward I personally believe using the Great Beast will get you good additional threat while not gimp you much, if at all, defense wise.</div>

</div>Yep, that's planned for b11. Keep in mind that it's not going to be as accurate, since it'll include the value of whatever item you're considering replacing, and it's only for 1 stat point, so the more a potential item has of a stat that scales in any way, the more inaccurate it'll be. All that said, it'll give good ballpark #s.<br>

</div>Total on your gear and in debuffs to the target (sunder, faerie fire, curse of recklessness).<br>
<br>
EDIT: To be more specific, it values Armor Penetration the same way it values everything else:<br>
<br>
Rawr doesn't use any form of equivalency of the different stats. Whatever calculation model you're using (Cat in this case) is given a complete character profile (items, gems, enchants, buffs, target debuffs, etc.). The model combines that all into whatever stats it uses (ap, crit%, hit%, procs, etc.), and then evaluates those stats to come up with one or more ratings (one for cats, DPS. Two for bears, Mit/Surv). Then the whole process is repeated, except for a character with that item slot empty (though keeping the enchant stats, of course). The value of an item is then defined as the difference between the total ratings with it equipped, and with the slot empty.<br>
<br>
For example, if you're comparing two chestpieces... With ChestpieceA equipped, your whole character evaluates to 110,000 DPS Points. With ChestpieceB equipped, your whole character evaluates to 113,000 DPS Points. With no chestpiece equipped, your whole character evaluates to 95000. Chestpiece A would be worth 15,000 points, and Chestpiece B would be worth 18,000 points. This system ensures that everything is completely accurate to the model, that piece that you're replacing don't skew the value of new pieces, and that items themselves don't skew their value.<br>
<br>
An example of this accuracy: If you used a system that was based on equivalency points, the simplest calculations can be very skewed. Suppose you were comparing a Delicate Living Ruby to a Delicate Crimson Spinel. 8agi vs 10agi. In an equivalency model, the Spinel has 25% more agi, so would be worth 25% more. But that's not the case; agi scales, so those last 2 points of agi in the Spinel are worth significantly more than the first two. Using a total comparison system like Rawr, you'd see that the Spinel is worth probably 30 to 35% more than the Ruby, depending on how much agi you've already got, and how agi scales for you.</div>

<br>
What can screw Teron is including the ghost, which that doesn't, or including two peoples logs which differ in timestamp (which is why you get ridiculous DPS sometimes). Best thing to check is the total damage done and charts-&gt;raids and mobs-&gt;pets-&gt; and see if vengeful spirit is there.<br>
<br>
What you have to remember is that in a fight that only lasts 3 minutes, bloodlust is up for a relatively large percentage of the time, same with drums and any other cooldown, so it skews the fight heavily in favour of those classes with cooldowns/those groups that take heavy advantage of cooldowns. It also looks like they got very lucky with shades, which is why that DPS is so sick.</div>

</div>What was your DPS rotation out of interest (throwing in a vague timeline to would help greatly)? And by "aggressively" trying to get these double stacks does it hinder your normal cycle and overall dps?<br>
<br>
So by my understanding they only occur when you can override a previous rip with a more powerful one i.e. refreshing it with a 5 point or trinketed rip in the last second of mangle then applying another mangle immediately before the first tick. Please correct me if i've misunderstood the concept but it sounds like this is very situational like getting lucky with Crits. and T4/OOC procs?</div>

I believe this is how it works, and because you have &lt;1 sec window to reapply rip is why people tend to have difficulty replicating it, even with the new "build in stopcasting" you're still looking at an average .3 seconds latency + reaction time on your reapply.</div>

		<div id="post_message_617080">Took me a minute to follow Boevis' explanation, so if anyone else is unclear, here's my version.<br>
<br>
When you rip, there's two seconds from when you apply the rip to when it first ticks.  Those are the two seconds you have to manipulate.  You want to have a mangle up when you apply the rip, but that will fade within those two seconds (usually one second in).  Then, apply a second mangle before the first tick of rip, and it will take both mangles.<br>
<br>
That said this is still somewhat difficult to do, and you aren't going to get it every single time, but you should be able to get a few on most stationary boss fights.</div>

Are you talking about tanking Hydross or the adds?<br>
<br>
If the adds, that's very easy to do in mixed "of X Protection" greens.<br>
<br>
If you mean Hydross, it's better for you to be the NR tank than the FR tank for several reasons.<br>
<br>
1. As a Tauren you get a free 10 NR<br>
2. <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=31399"><span><span class="purplename">[The Natural Ward]</span></span></a> sucks less than <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=31398"><span><span class="purplename">[The Frozen Eye]</span></span></a></div>

		<div id="post_message_617371">It is doable. I have tanked both frost and nature phases (not in one fight, naturally) when our regular plate tanks didnt show up. My unbuffed resistances were around 230-250. With aura and flask of chromatic wonder, you are at 335-355 resist. Or you can use elixir of ironskin to fill crit gap, which may be more important that the 35 resistance.<br>
<br>
You want green headpiece with +20 resist enchant, which gives you about 57 resistance. Then jewelry (necklace, ring) crafted by JC. Apart from this, there is only green stuff as far as i recall. You need to enchant it appropriately (stamina, resists, defense - whatever gives the best overall result). +15 resist on back is also good so try to get resist cloak.</div>

		<!-- message -->
		<div id="post_message_617445">I'm curious about the best gear/ability rotation to handle spinning bosses, eg Solarian. When I'm trying, I'm usually top 5 DPS in my (3/4 TK, 5/6 SSC) guild on bleedable bosses, but this encounter proves exceptionally difficult.<br>
<br>
After examining the WWS reports, I've come to the following conclusions: because Solarian is constantly spinning to send arcane missiles at people, I'm missing way more than I usually would due to blocks/parries/etc (6-8% with hit-capped gear); and because I'm missing opportunities for shreds, it's taking me a lot longer to get through a cycle, and as a result Rip is not up most of the  time (down to 12% of my damage versus its usual 30-35%).<br>
<br>
What are cat druids using as a combination for this boss? Should I give up on shred, equip the idol of terror and go for 5 mangle/1 rip combinations? Should I experiment with more Expertise gear? (I'm wearing my only really decent piece, the shoulderpads from Hydross.)<br>
<br>
I'm also curious about whether it's worth putting points in improved FB for non-bleedable bosses like VR. I haven't yet due to wanting to keep points in other things, and I've seen the non-improved FB vs. shred graphs, but it's another frustrating fight for me.</div>

		<div id="post_message_617449">I've MT'ed nature phase a couple of times out of roster necessity, and I look like a complete goon in the set. If I recall correctly (servers are down for maintenance atm) I had 19k-ish raid buffed, uncrittable, with capped NR (this actually is more important than avoidance/that bit of HP - unlucky spikes are more likely to kill you than healers going OOM at this point of TBC's lifespan) Keep in mind this was before the feral staves change which gave another cartload of AP.<br>
<br>
Threat on Hydross after the initial grab should not be a problem. People nuke the elementals first, and in modern day raiding DPS who can't keep an eye out on the threat meters should go back to UBRS to learn how not to pull aggro.<br>
<br>
What IS touchy is two things: firstly, an abyssmal amount of dodge, due to needing to stack greens, and the actual grabs on transition. With virtually no +hit and no +expertise, there's a tendency for Murphy's Law to take effect and bite you in the rear with a parry/miss string... Your positioning and raid needs to be aware of this; it's much more iffy than warriors/paladins in epic resist gear.<br>
<br>
That being said, remember that armor means nothing. Swap in your highest DPS staff (Gladiator/ZA staff/Terestian's is awesome especially the ones with +hit), make sure you grab Hydross's attention, and you can swap back to your highest stam staff when the debuff stacks to 100% if you're really worried about getting spiked.<br>

Needing resist on an addtank really depends on how you do the boss.<br>
You can have 4 tanks and aoe them, which will probably take all of them down before the mark reaches higher levels.<br>
Resists here are really only mandatory for tanking the adds up to the 100% mark and further, which will depend on your raids performance and strategy.</div>

</div>Well hey there, cutie. ;-*<br>
<br>
Anyway, thanks for the advice. One last set of questions: if I get all those greens and glyphs and flasks and shit, I'll be at 309 self-buffed, and with the Hunter buff I'm at (I think) 379. This is above cap, correct? What is cap? How far BELOW the cap can I be before it starts getting dangerous?</div>

		<div id="post_message_617485">Resistance is non-linear, especially towards the end. Think of it the same way as agility stacking where going from 98 to 99% avoidance is a huge boon for just another percent. Although of course, the actual cap for resist mechanics is 75%. The cap is lv*5, or 365 in the case of boss mobs. Always plan with a hunter/totem in mind, so 295 unbuffed.<br>
<br>
It doesn't get 'dangerous' unless you get multiple 50% resists in a row, the probability of which increases the further you get from the cap. My point being there's no real cutoff - aim for the cap, or pray to be lucky.<br>
<br>
In terms of greens to go for, Elementalist/Dragonhawk are the best (armor doesn't matter!) and I've got a couple of lv117's too - the names elude me right now. You can put a 20NR patch on the headpiece and a 15resi on the chest... those two enchants give the best benefit in their respective slots in this situation. The others are situational and probably depend on what you can actually scrounge up.<br>
<br>
Edit: Some final thoughts - don't get any misconceptions here. A warrior or paladin will fare much better in terms of mitigating damage due to the availability of epic resist gear (and class abilities.. boo hoo), so your raid and especially healers need to understand beforehand that this solution is not optimal and is the result of circumstance. Also, be really really sure to have a pot/HS macro for this, if you don't already. IT WILL SAVE YOUR LIFE. MULTIPLE TIMES.<br>
<br>
When the Frost tank is pulling Hydross over the line, try to trail behind Hydross, so that your opening Mangle right as he changes color won't be parried. This also sets you up to pull him back over when it's time. If you really want to maximize your chances of survival, go hard at the start of each transition with your highest DPS staff, then switch to your highest stam one at 100% and consider stopping all attacks (except maybe mangle) to lessen the chances of a parry gib. <br>
<br>
Lastly, if you have any say in it, go for tanking the NR phases and let a warrior get FrR gear, rather than the other way around.</div>

I'm usually above 4k AP on trash, but my full crit immune set is still a bit behind that, maybe more like 2,800-3,000. I'm wondering whether it's actually practical to try and get this up quite a bit?</div>

</div>I find myself making room for the expertise ring and neck on anything that remotely requires threat generation, and gaining crit immunity by simply wearing 2pc s3 gladiator in slots that don't yet have T6 (when that becomes difficult I'll determine "weakest" T6 slots via Rawr). To me, AP in bear is a tertiary consideration behind expertise &amp; hit, and even hit doesn't feel worth dramatically altering tank gear for.</div>

</div>That means you effectively do 2.5 mangles (40% proc chance iirc) for every mangle that you would otherwise do - that's a HUGE loss of energy compared to the damage you gain. <br>
<br>
@Ledneh: The melee tank on Leo doesn't have to back off - they changed it in 2.1 so that the splash on fireballs is smaller than his hitbox so you can still melee. Lots of guilds use melee tanks afaik.</div>

		<div id="post_message_617997">I'd been researching and preparing to take over as Leo FR tank due to dodgy Warlock attendance, and as dukes said, they changed the splash range on fireballs so that if you and the melee stand as far apart as possible in front and behind him (respectively), then the melee won't eat the splash. However, some things you need to be aware of:<br>
<br>
a) As with all magical damage fights, we'd take more damage than a Warrior (Def Stance / Imp Def Stance) and a Demo Warlock (Soul Link). So healers need to be aware of that.<br>
<br>
b) I read from some people that had tried this, that threat is a concern with Rage based tanks because you resist a lot of the damage. Less of a concern with Druids naturally, since we can do more with less Rage, but you still may want to consider higher threat pieces in slots you aren't using for FR. Also, you don't need crit immunity for this, as npc casted spells don't crit.<br>
<br>
c) Since you can't reposition demon phase Leo, the 15% split is clutch. If he's sitting plunk in the middle of everything, the other tank(s) plus melee that are killing humanoid Leo will have to tread very carefully around you so they don't eat the splash. Secondly, if Leo decides to whirlwind across where you are tanking demon Leo, then you are likely to eat the high damage DoT. What you might consider doing is building a 20-30k threat lead (to cover healer aggro from 15% to 0%) or so and then backing to a safe spot where you can be healed and not get other people hit with the fireball splash.<br>
<br>
Of course, I never actually managed to try this, but I'd be very interested in hearing from you how it went.<br>
<br>
Re: Hydross. I tanked nature phase a couple times when the Warrior was missing. Threat isn't that much of an issue, even looking like a Barrens reject (i.e. with tons of nature protection greens). If you can, try to have Misdirects saved for you, even 1 Hunter should cover it on every cycle (I think?). Since we normally used two DPS Warriors to tank Hydross, people were very aware of threat and we had the whole raid switch sides in case someone did pull aggro. So applying that same caution when I tanked meant we didn't have any aggro shenanigans.</div>

</div>I've tanked demon on every one of our Leo kills for many months now (after the changes to fireball size) and there's been no drama.  Badge gear, blue cloak with enchant, Ony trinket (not one that many druids would have, but I was our original rag tank way back when) and a couple of pieces of pvp gear for anti-crit (I often help pickup the human phase as well in the first 85%)<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I'm curious about the best gear/ability rotation to handle spinning bosses, eg Solarian. When I'm trying, I'm usually top 5 DPS in my (3/4 TK, 5/6 SSC) guild on bleedable bosses, but this encounter proves exceptionally difficult.<br>
<br>
After examining the WWS reports, I've come to the following conclusions: because Solarian is constantly spinning to send arcane missiles at people, I'm missing way more than I usually would due to blocks/parries/etc (6-8% with hit-capped gear); and because I'm missing opportunities for shreds, it's taking me a lot longer to get through a cycle, and as a result Rip is not up most of the  time (down to 12% of my damage versus its usual 30-35%).<br>
<br>
What are cat druids using as a combination for this boss? Should I give up on shred, equip the idol of terror and go for 5 mangle/1 rip combinations? Should I experiment with more Expertise gear? (I'm wearing my only really decent piece, the shoulderpads from Hydross.)<br>
<br>
I'm also curious about whether it's worth putting points in improved FB for non-bleedable bosses like VR. I haven't yet due to wanting to keep points in other things, and I've seen the non-improved FB vs. shred graphs, but it's another frustrating fight for me.<br>
<br>
Cheers,<br>

</div>For mobs like Solarian you just have to move behind her, if you can't strafe around while still attacking practice until you can.<br>
Personally I don't think the Feral Aggression talent is worth it, Ferocious Bite is a horrible finisher because it drains all of your energy.<br>
I only use it if I am low on energy and the mob is about to die, normally I will just Shred again.<br>
I have never been DPS on Void Reaver as I tank him most weeks in a very high threat set, best I have managed so far is 75% of melee attacks made against me.<br>
<br>
You ask about "cat druids" but I don't think you will find many here, Feral druids are very useful to a raid because they can be bears or cats, being only one means you chose the wrong class.<br>
I get to be a cat a lot of the time as our other feral druid likes to tank, I am happy to do either and will do what is best for the raid.<br>
I prefer fights where both roles are needed as I really feel useful then, Hydross and Lurker stand out so far.  We are only 5/6 SSC and 2/4 TK.<br>

I don't expect the report to be up much longer.<br>

The point where swipe &gt; lacerate is easily reached with 4t6 (15% extra swipe damage). Up to that point, you either need to be in the DPS group with sunders up on the mob, or tanking something with very low armour (RoS p1 for example).</div>

</div>The short answer is yes, its possible.  Amazingly easily actually.  Currently in SSC/TK gear without the T6 set bonus i can get up to 225 non crit swipes.  According to some theory crafting done before i believe the magic number is 220 average damage on swipe.</div>

		<div id="post_message_618862">Well lacerate is 235 threat. So 235 average damage on swipe. You must be wearing pretty much full dps gear if you are averaging 225 swipes in tier 5 gear. DR is of course, as Dukes points out, the key - on a low armour boss you'll reach it a lot quicker. Anyway thanks for the comments - the 4pcTier6 bonus was something I hadn't really thought about, but I'm probably a week or 2 away from that at the moment.</div>

		<div id="post_message_618894">Leo is completely tankable by a feral.  Its possible to put together a gear set without any badge gear -- but the badge gear is easier.  If you want a non-badge set, there is a craftable cloth chest and the aldor rep crafted belt/boots/legs.  Fill in with a couple green pieces and a head enchant.  Its entirely reasonable to be at 19k+ health buffed and capped in FR, using crafted gear, greens, a chromatic flask and a paladin aura.  With that said, the badge loot is a bit better.  And the badge chest is the clear first badge piece to buy.  I like using 2 piece of T4 for the extra rage generation.  I use my best DPS weapon for threat generation.<br>
<br>
One trick I like for the pick up is to try to moonfire him while he is whirlwinding if he'll go to demon phase mid whirlwind.  If he isn't, I try to leave a rip ticking and shift to bear form right before the demon phase starts.  Either one is a little extra initial threat and sometimes help with faster pickups.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I know what it is... It's a mange bug it was from the version 2.0<br>
Some times you can get double mangle bonus on bleeds (damaga*1.3*1.3)<br>
<br>
To look like it works best way to see - go skettis and find elite trees go bear form and:<br>
1) make 5x lacerates and write down the bleeed damage number<br>
2) add mangle look it = damage*1.3<br>
3) wait it all wears off and now add mangle and wait until it 2-0.5 sec left for mangle debuff to wear off and now start lacereting get 5x lacerates and WOOT no mangle debuff but it tics for (damage*1.3) now add mangle and WOOOOT (damage*1.3*1.3)<br>
<br>
To have it you must be the only druid so mangle debuff can wear off, in cat you can some times see this bug becouse of rip GCD mangle - standart damage order, if in next 12 sec you get 4-5combo and right after rip end add new rip (it's in time 1sec before mangle wears off, and for some unknown reason server resume count it in damage even it ended) you add new mangle and have rip = (damage*1.3*1.3)</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Surely the last page of posts explains the mechanic behind the double rip perfectly enough? Wait until mangle is on but rip isn't (the last 1-2 seconds of the debuff), then rip, then wait for mangle to run out and then put on a new mangle. The rip gets the benefit of both the initial mangle and the new one. I'm not sure if this is a "perfect" bug where it always happens, or if it's dependant on client/server lag interaction and will only happen some of the time.</div>

I believe this is how it works, and because you have &lt;1 sec window to reapply rip is why people tend to have difficulty replicating it, even with the new "build in stopcasting" you're still looking at an average .3 seconds latency + reaction time on your reapply.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">While trying the double mangle debuff "bug" on mobs, i noticed something that didn't make sense.  When I ripped during the last second of mangle, that rip acted as if it had one mangle debuff for the next 12secs, even though none was up.  If you then proceeded to throw up a mangle, (didn't matter if a few rips ticks went by), then the rip would receive the "double" mangle debuff.<br>
<br>
This shows that the bug is solely based on landing rip during that last 1/2 second of a mangle and somehow the rip gets the debuff for the next 12 seconds as well.  Is this correct or a different bug altogether?</div>

</div>Yes its the same bug that has been discussed as dukes just pointed out, i went home yesterday and had a 2 hour session trying to get the timing right. I succeeded a couple of times but nailing the timing was very difficult from my experiences, its probably because im playing on an oceanic realm with around 450-500 ping, oh for want of an aussie server thats actually in Australia :P.<br>
<br>
But if you stick the timing use it 750 rip ticks yes please!</div>

		<div id="post_message_619376">Ledneh: Calculator's are almost always going to overestimate your dps because they calculate pure tank&amp;spank situations. In this case, you're losing dps when she vanishes, waiting for the little guys to spawn, running to the priests, priests dying quick so not being able to get off full rip cycles, running back to her... One thing you can do is Barkskin + Hurricane each pack of little guys. That does 2500 dps for 10 sec if you can hit em all.<br>
<br>
Also, I'm guessing those stats are unbuffed. They seem decent for that progression level. Gear looks fine, though there are a few weird gem choices, but that's not so bad. Perhaps you need to be grouped better... Grouped with a dps warrior, and an enh shammy? Or at least some BM hunters?</div>

</div>I don't recall, but it IS possible I was left in the tank group for the trash, VR, etc.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the thoughts, folks. I'm gonna see if any older WWSes for more tanky-spanky fights are still available and look to those.<br>
<br>
(by the way, for whoever asked, some of my gems/enchants are odd because much of my cat and bear gear is still shared. In a couple cases, my choices are odd because they were purple gems rotting in my bank and I didn't want to spend money and I'm too lazy to replace them <i>so there</i>)<br>
<br>
I know the single biggest improvement I can make is powershifting more, but doing so worries me basically because of mana consumption.<br>
<br>
When I powershift (using /cancelform /cast Cat Form), my estimated mana bar (from Pitbull) does not update, and never does until I assume caster form (however temporarily). I'm assuming this is because of the 2.3 shifting changes, where the switch to caster simply doesn't happen server-side. Is there a fix for this? My version of Pitbull is totally up to date, so I'm not sure it's that.<br>
<br>
Also, I know the more you powershift the greater your long-term DPS is (as long as you're not powershifting at &gt;25 energy), but how much is "enough"? I worry that I'm going to run my mana bar dry and be unable to pop out and Rebirth or Innervate or whatever without being stuck in caster form--while a mana pot could cure this, what if I'm on cooldown for pots? Then I'm cramboned--and it could happen at any time since, as I said above, my mana estimate bar is broked for 2.3 powershifting.</div>

A) I think '/cast mangle' will do nothing because 'mangle' isn't a spell, only 'Mangle (Cat)' and 'Mangle (Bear)' are, and I think you need to suffix them with another set of () so that it doesn't try to read Cat/Bear as a spell rank. <br>
B) Supposing they made '/cast mangle' actually cast the appropriate mangle, then the macro above would first stop casting whatever spell you're casting (which is almost certainly nothing, since you can't cast any spells with cast times in cat form, other than like Pick Herb, etc), then cast Mangle. Nothing to do with shifting at all.</div>

</div>Vengeful Spirit is included as a pet, which accounts for the extra ~500k. The DPS is skewed (RPDS should be about 31k for 4.9mil/154 but it shows as ~36.5k). It looks like the spirit hasn't been assigned to anyone, and I can't work out if it's just factored everyone elses damage up or done something else. The DPS column adds up to the RDPS at the bottom, and removing the bits of DPS from people with very little DPS time still doesn't make it fit. The damage seems to add up when looking at individual abilities though, so I can't see where the parser fiddled it, without just factoring up everything.<br>
<br>
It's an impressive parse even if you knock ~9% off everyone's DPS, but it's just... wrong. It's also marred by the wipe at 150k damage done just before :p<br>
<br>
As for crit rate, how can you try and take a statistical crit rate from a single parse? 40 shreds is no-where near enough to justify that because you have 56% crit rate, you should have about that in the parse. A single crit/non-crit throws the percentage 2.5% either way. Sure, you might have a lot of parses that show the same thing, but you really need a massive sample in order to do it properly.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">So for the first time in 3 months, I got a crit rate that was almost equal to the crit I should have been getting all along on Teron last night.  Behold: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080306181003/http://wowwebstats.com/abbgbubtlkd25?s=3187-3340" target="_blank">2011 wws</a><br>
My character screen crit rate is 53.4% buffed, +3% with judgement, yet every week I have had -10% on shred or melee for as long as I've been keeping track.  Either I am really unlucky or there is definitely something wrong with crit.  I should have 52-53 yellow and 56 white but I've never come close until tonight.<br>
Anyway, that anecdotal blabber aside I really just wanted to post my triumph someplace someone might care since I'm only 7th in my guild and no one notices the kitten deeps. </div>

<br>
Check out those crit rates. I have 51% onscreen + Judgement + swapping Agi/WF totem. You cannot belive how mad I was we wiped on the try before because I had finally had luck an had _normal_ crit rates like they should have been and was able to hold 1990 DPS until the dumbass with Spirit had to get a disconnect. On the kill I got again the not so great crit rate.<br>
<br>
Just as awesome as your top combat rogue had 20% more crit as ours.</div>

I'm 100% confident that if there was a 15-20minute fight, where all we did was beat on a stationary mob, the crit rates would be normalized to our character pane.<br>
<br>
The RNG is just as bad for combat mechanics as it is for loot :P  From crit rates, to crushing blows, I sincerely hope for an 'overhaul' of some kind for WotLK.</div>

		<div id="post_message_620600">Didn't I post like 2 pages ago that the v2 client of wws auto includes ghosts?  If you use the old 'v1' method it doesn't.  We have tried to upload via the v1 method to fix teron, but then we had issues with other bosses.  Ultimately it doesn't matter because Los said he's going to re parse the entire wws database soon and it's on their top list of things to do.  Also it has 0 effect on anyones personal dps.  The raid dps is calculated by total damage done divided by the time in combat multiplied by the average % of combat time for everyone in the raid.  This is of course a stupid way to calculate raid dps and it's being changed according to Los in the wws forums.  Personal dps is calculated by your total damage done divided by your time in combat multiplied by your presence factor, ghosts have no factor in this.  Presence is found by checking for any actions taken in 5s blocks, so if you do nothing for 20s that will be factored out of your dps, but if you FF in the middle you will only get 15s of time factored out.<br>
If you want a more accurate measure of your dps for the time you spend dpsing, you shouldn't take unnecessary actions when you run out on bosses.  The mage class suffers on this for instance since the fireball dot keeps ticking when they aren't dpsing.<br>
All of our logs are unedited and just uploaded, I suggest everyone else do the same.  The v2 client will be fixed and all the logs re-parsed and editing them could effect that when it happens.<br>
<br>
Anyway I have been tracking my crit rate since mid September on Teron.  That's about 16 kills (week off for holidays and one Teron bugged and despawnd) and in all the other 15 I had roughly -10% crit.  That is a fairly significant amount.  Wtb +10% crit the next 3 months to balance out!<br>

</div>Previous to your last post, you last posted nearly 500 posts ago (10 pages for me). I didn't realise you couldn't get rid of the ghost with the v2 parser as I only ever used the manual one, and I never had any issues (bar Akama and RoS, which are screwed for something like that in any case). You could just not assign Vengeful Spirit as a pet in the manual client without having to directly edit the logs.<br>
<br>
I know how it adds up DPS, it just doesn't match the actual DPS done to the boss. I apologise about the DPS comment - the actual damage adds up, but the DPS doesn't even with the two bottom players (who had ~1% dps time) not included, so I assumed there was something wrong (and yes, I know how it calculates presence but I was doing a quick estimate at work).<br>
<br>
As for having less crit rate - there was a theory when 2.0 was introduced that all bosses gained 5% worth of resillience. I don't think it was ever proved/disproved, people just kind of forgot about it because there's never really been a fight in TBC that is comparable to patchwerk, bar Teron, and then it's too short a fight to say anything serious statistically about it, even when you take an amalgamation of a load of runs together. I'm still wary of the WoW RNG after never seeing 4 or 5 of the items in BT drop <i>ever</i> even having farmed it for 4 months with a month of learning before that.</div>

</div>That is exactly what we did, but doing so broke 2 other bosses in the log.  I don't remember which or why/how since it was months ago but since then we just strait upload v2 logs.  <br>
Also I have no idea where my post went... maybe I just didn't click submit and fell asleep or something.  Oh well.  <br>
<br>
Either way my luck has always been pretty bad so it's probably just that.  I had a similar issue with my mage for a year pre TBC.</div>

<br>
However, no where have I been able to find the actual formulas or item values for the authors' mitigation stats (Armor, Agility, Stamina, Dodge, Defense, Resilience, etc.).  Sooo.. I've been deconstructing published values, and made my own based on the values given.  The idea is that I want to be able to choose to evaluate gear based on the following:<br>
<br>
- Gurgleblaster's Mit Values<br>
- My own "adjusted" values<br>
<br>
I've put these values into Excel (much like shadowpanter.net) with a list of Druid gear and would love for someone to verify or help me tune my numbers so I might be able to share my results with the public. My goal is to perhaps discover the "perfect" mitigation values which takes into account a person's current gear and adjusts attribute priorities accordingly.<br>
<br>
Deconstructing Gurgleblaster's "Mitigation Points" I came up with the following attribute values:<br>
( my calculated mitigation values have been *very* close to the published values.. though not perfect )<br>
AC - 0.5610<br>
Agi - 3.7740<br>
Sta - 4.1335<br>
Res - 1.2920<br>
Dod - 2.6530<br>
Def - 2.5080<br>
Blue Gem - 8 * Sta<br>
Red Gem - 8 * Agi (or maybe 4 * Sta + 4 * Agi)<br>
Yellow Gem - 4 * Sta (assuming green gem use)<br>
<br>
Since 103 Resilience = 156 Defense (dang it, can't verify my source) I would expect that Resilience = 1.6559 instead of 1.2920, or perhaps Defense is being undervalued in Gurgleblaster's mitigation values.  Also, I understand that these values will shift after 30,000 armor.  Any input would be greatly appreciated.<br>
<br>
Thanks in advance!</div>

</div>Sounds like it will be an interesting read, I have suspected for a while that all attacks except when duel wielding are on a two roll system.<br>
The majority of testing has always been done by rogues followed by fury warriors as those classes are the ones most interested in the results.<br>
From a coding perspective it means everything is done the same way unless you are swinging two melee weapons.<br>
<br>
Is the lowered crit chance against bosses or anything a higher level or is it just too early to say?<br>
My mind is reeling at the amount of data needed to actually work this out, best I just be patient.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Okey dokey time for someone to tell me why I'm such a dang fuckup at kitty form fights.<br>
<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080306181003/http://wowwebstats.com/cggzhrajsulg1?s=9041-9378&amp;m" target="_blank">Here's a WWS for TK last week</a>; in particular is the Solarian death split. I was tenth place, with 750 DPS.<br>
<br>
Now this wouldn't bother me, since I know cat DPS isn't exactly top of the line, but all but one of the others in the top 10 have like 200 more DPS than me, and I can't possibly attribute that to just "lol druid". I took a look at the Toskk DPS thingy, too, and it says with my stats I should be doing more like 880, not 750--still lower than the rest, but not as absurdly so. (and if I add powershifting to that, my expected DPS according to the formulae goes up even more)<br>
<br>
I'm doing the right attack cycle (Shred to 4/5 CP, wait for 80, Rip, Mangle), or at least I think I am, so what could be going on? Is WWS mistaken in my DPS? Is Toskk overestimating my potential? Are cat druids just doomed to be this far below the pack by nature?<br>
<br>
(edit) For reference: 3k AP, 32% crit, 86 hit, 2t4</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>Well your crit rate seems very low for that level of the game. Your hit rate is low too, 10% miss on Shred is a pain normally, but on this fight in particular where you are continusally on the move to keep behind her, missed Shred's add up.<br>
<br>
Your Mangle&gt;Shred&gt;Rip ratio is also terrible but I'm going to attribute that to the fact that you have to keep messing about with adds. The DPS classes that beat you are mostly AoE classes and gain a lot from the prescence of the adds, whereas the target shifting diminshes your DPS.<br>
<br>
I realise the fights are different and you may have been mangling adds though so that is going to eat into your DPS a lot. The fight isn't terribly good for Druids because we need time to "set up" on a target as it were. To get Mangle, CP and Rip cycles going to start hitting the high DPS. Having to drop that and go messing about with low hp, low lifespan adds hurts our DPS more than a lot of other classes.<br>
<br>
I wouldn't pay much attention to that WWS, the top 10 are mostly Warlocks, Mages and Hunters who all get massively inflated DPS due to AoE potential on this fight. The rogues are a better judge for you to compare yourself too as their AoE is more limited and they have similar issues with dropping CP when switching targets.<br>
<br>
You are also suffering compared to them by not being in the melee group. Compare your buffs gained in the fight to the top rogues. You got Battle Shout. Thats it. Meedeoker got Windfury, Drums of Battle, SoE, Unleashed rage from your Enh Shaman, Ferocious Inspiration from the groups hunter(s) and of course Bloodlust. You got two Wraths, he got zero. For him to have less than a 100 DPS over you with all those group buffs well I wouldn't worry too much if I were you. Next time I'd try asking for the 2nd hunter in your group. The hunter gets LotP and Battleshout whereas you get Ferocious Inspiration, win/win.<br>
<br>

</div>Yeah, the more I thought about it the more I realized there aren't really any good checks for me. There ARE a couple in Karazhan though--I went through my old WWSes of our "pro" group (T5 raiders doing Kara for badges and random loot that never drops I'm looking at you pocketwatch), and I was topping the charts readily in several DPS-only fights there (Maiden, Aran, to a lesser degree Nightbane ('cause I had my bear gear on for the skellies), and Prince).<br>
<br>
I HAVE been DPS-only on Morogrim before, but I've long lost those WWS parses/logs. <br>
<br>
Incidentally, I topped overall DPS on Vashj a few nights ago, with third place on Vashj specifically. So I guess I'm either learning, or that's a better fight for cats, or some combination of the two (I was on Naga DPS/elemental overflow duty for p2 since we had a prot warrior, of course).<br>
<br>
<br>
On a related note: we're starting serious attempts on Kael'thas on Sunday, and all of next week we're skipping SSC to make attempts on the faggy elf. If I'm going to be tanking anything, it'll be the axe, but I'm going to assume that they're just going to make me cat melee (assuming they invite me at all of course). I suspect P5 is kind of a pain in the dick for melee thanks to the nether stuff, but besides, how well can I be expected to perform in that fight?</div>

		<div id="post_message_621768">I think Kael'thas really favors a feral druid for his flexibility, so I wouldn't worry about that.<br>
If it's not the axe you're tanking during P2 you can tank one of the other Weapons in cat gear and deal damage after that superior to a defensive spec warrior. Also do not worry too much about P5, as the nether vapor is not that much of a problem.<br>
<br>
Concerning Lady Vashj, I think the ability to shift out of the entangling roots increases your damage uptime over other classes, which made you excel in that fight.<br>

</div>It's funny how some people say Rawr values Sta too high or def too high... It doesn't. It values it based on your current character. Equip a bunch of agi-heavy gear and add your buffs, and you'll see the value of agi go up accordingly. For me, a delicate crimson spinel is almost 2x the value of a solid empyrean sapphire.

stam is definitely favored when you have only a few buffs - but once you start getting buffed out (grace of air, scrolls, elixirs, scorpid/swarm, etc) agility comes out far ahead - and that's for main tanking.  I'm a sucker for agi+sta gems as a result; gives a good mix!</div>

		<div id="post_message_622811">Little question to all of you.<br>
<br>
My raid generally brings along one enhancement shaman, one fury warrior, three rogues, one hunter (survival) and one or two feral Druids. Now you have to know that in my guild, the Druid class leader is Moonkin. So he doesn't really know anything about feral (he's never played it). And well, the rogue leader tends to argue that group 5 (our main melee group) makeup shoud be as such:<br>
<br>
Fury Warrior<br>
Enhancement Shaman<br>
Rogue<br>
Rogue<br>
Rogue<br>
<br>
And then in a random group one feral druid is left with the hunter. Well first of all I can't help but feeling this is unfair (snivles). People tend to think my DPS is crap because I tank half the time, and when I'm here to DPS i'm always out of the Shaman group. But that's just the sentimental part of things. There's also the fact that I truly believe that switching a rogue with one of the Druids (me or the other feral) would boost raid DPS. Basically one one side we have:<br>
<br>
3 rogues, one shaman, one warrior - buffed WF, BS, Str and Rage<br>
one druid, one hunter - buffed ILotP (and generally BS because a tank warrior is around)<br>
<br>
the alternative would be:<br>
2 rogues, one shaman, one warrior, one druid - buffed WF, BS, Str, Rage ILotP<br>
one hunter, one rogue - buffed BS<br>
<br>
In my alternative, one rogue loses almost all of his buffs, and the hunter loses ILotP, but the Druid gains all the buffs that the Rogue loses, and he provides ILotP to the two other rogues, the shaman and the warrior.<br>
<br>
------------------<br>
<br>
Reasons for why I think the druid should be in the DPS group:<br>
- Unleashed Rage is about as powerful for a Druid (+500ap approx.) as Windfury is for a Rogue.<br>
- ILotP is not only a great DPS increase for all melee classes, it's also an anti-death tool.<br>
<br>
Do you have any idea how I could convince my raid leader (who is actually the enhancement shammy) and the rogue leader to put a Druid in that group and leave a rogue out (they could change which rogue is out each raid too, so that one rogue doesn't always have to raid unbuffed).<br>
<br>
We're at the start of Hyjal-BT, for information, and the DPS of all our melee classes is comparable (though the warrio is somewhat slightly lower).<br>
<br>
PS: Oh, and to make the equation slightly more complex, one of the rogues who could potentially be put out of the melee group is my girlfriend and is probably going to hate me for this.</div>

</div>Your RL is doing the right thing, the above group will be better for the raid.<br>
Stop worrying about your personal DPS and do what is best for the raid, this has been brought up many times on this forum and I am fairly sure it has come up once or twice in this thread.<br>
<br>
I generally do the groups in the raids I go on and while I would like the pampered group I normally end up in with the hunters which isn't a bad deal anyway.<br>
It all comes down who turns up for the raid, sometimes there is room in the melee group and sometimes there isn't, last raid I put the other feral in it and I was in a group with one hunter and three casters.<br>
<br>
If the people you raid with are too immature to look at what factors are affecting your DPS potential you will need to explain that, if you can't it won't be fun.<br>
Do you use WWS?<br>
You can use that to look at individual fights or even specific sections of trash so you can filter out the parts you were tanking for and show them what your DPS while only DPS is.<br>
<br>
Best group you can really hope for in a raid while helping raid DPS instead of personal DPS, if your melee group is has 100% attendance,  would be:<br>
Shaman (most likely a resto one)<br>
Hunter (BM)<br>
Hunter (BM)<br>
Hunter (Survival)<br>
Feral druid (You)</div>

<br>
One lacerate, the fact that you can stack it to 5 times and that it is affected by mangle means that it will surely become better for DPS and than Swipe. Threatwise we won't be able to tell till we get it...<br>
<br>
But at least there will be a point in tab-lacerating again for multitanking.</div>

		<div id="post_message_623102">I disagree completely Cluey, assuming you don't have a 'Hunter Group', a Feral Druid does belong in the melee group.<br>
<br>
Going off the Rogue Spreadsheet, gaining UR, imp BS, Imp SoE and GoA/WF Twisting is ~125 DPS for me, LotP is +75 DPS for each rogue at my tier.  That's 275 DPS gain.<br>
<br>
Losing the imp BS, imp Totems, and UR is -140 DPS for the rogue booted from melee group to MT group (warrior and shaman assumed in MT group)<br>
<br>
I don't even need to look at the LotP benefits for the Warrior or the Enh Shaman to see that ideal Melee Group is Warrior, Druid, Shaman, Roguex2.<br>
<br>
Looking at the 3x Hunter Shaman Druid group, it's actually pretty bad for your personal DPS (and arguably not that great for RDPS since hunters often outrange LotP)  I personally prefer the MT group with GoA/WF twisting shaman to maximize tank threat.  I'm fairly certain all this has been covered before at some point and time.<br>
<br>
The big deal for rogues having an Enh Shaman is the UR, around 100 DPS itself, the differences between Talented WF/SoE/BS is very minor in comparison.  The same can be said of druids, though we get more from SoE and GoA totems than the rogue does.  Interestingly, UW adds about 100 DPS to a druid as well because of our insane AP pool (around 4.75 AP: 1 DPS with UW adding 450 AP).<br>
<br>
People often underestimate Feral DPS because we're assumed to be "Tanks first, DPS second, just like Warriors." and thus rarely get first (or 2nd or 5th) choice on DPS gear, get thrown in the MT group "for his threat" because crits are so prot necessary for warrior threat (sarcasm there, and it's just as often that we don't get 1st choice on tanking gear either)  So in general, we're using worse gear, in a worse group, and thus do over 200 less DPS than we could be perpetuating the "druids suck at DPS"</div>

</div>125 DPS is probably less than 10% gain for you.<br>
2x Ferocious Inspiration = 6% direct gain, and you still have SoE and GoA in Cluey's example. I'm pretty sure that that evens out personal DPS. If hunters are outranging LotP it's their own fault, not yours (you're limited to melee range, after all, and there's very very few situations where it's required for hunters to be at max range).<br>
<br>
I think the main point that should be made is that the RDPS gain of switching between the two group setups is minimal (maybe 200 dps tops, which should be less than 1% total RDPS). Sure, it can make a difference sometimes, but most of the time it won't, and not using the absolutely optimal group setup won't make you wipe over and over on something - if you're wiping that often there's something inherently wrong in what you're doing. Setting up groups correctly in general gives a very big gain, but arguing over who gets the most benefit within a particular group setup when the argument has been going on for so long and nothing conclusive has come of it is an exercise in futility.<br>
<br>
It's better to make the majority of people happy and sacrifice a tiny bit of RDPS than it is to force people to do particular things because it's "better for the raid" yet actually piss off more people than you make happy.<br>
<br>
I'm also pretty sure the lacerate change is nothing to get excited about, unless they do something ridiculous or change the way the 20% threat modifier works.</div>

</div>I'm actually very fortunate in this regard.  A few months ago I joined a guild that was working on Kael (we just killed Archimonde).  At the time, the raid leader had the mentality that he would never bring a feral druid simply for their dps.  I have been in a 2xrogue, warrior, enh shaman group for most of this time since the guild only has 2 raiding rogues.  Over that time, when made to full dps, myself and the other feral druid have been giving near-top dps numbers and have caused the raid leader to completely reverse his previous mindset.<br>
<br>
While we still are classified as OT's for slots and receive our invites from the tanking role leader, if one of the physical dps is missing, the extra slot goes to a feral for dps.</div>

</div>Remember that the BM hunters won't have Hawk Eye so it is only the Survival hunter who might out range it, seeing as they are in a group with you to get 5% crit to help keep Expose Weakness up they should be paying attention to where they stand.<br>
A shaman twisting totems in the MT group means they will be enhance as they are the only ones with the free cool downs to do it, raiding with two enhance shaman would be great and would solve a lot of the "which group" problems but isn't a reality for many.<br>
Additionally how long will twisting still be an option?<br>
After they stop it there will be no Grace of Air in the melee group or even the tank group if windfury is being used for threat.<br>
<br>
We only have one regular rogue but we have an enhance shaman, two DPS warriors (fury and arms) and sometimes a ret paladin or a second rogue.  One of the feral druids would probably do better in the group than the paladin but a paladin without windfury is much worse than a feral in the hunter group.<br>
I have been tanking trash from the hunter or melee group for a while now and even Void Reaver, being in the melee group for Void Reaver is actually really good as the buffs do silly stuff for threat.<br>
<br>
It will always come down to a compromise somewhere though and depends on each raids class balance.<br>
If you have enough shaman for multiple groups that rocks but isn't all that common for alliance, if you do then being in the tank group isn't to bad for either the displaced rogue or feral druid.<br>
<br>
Brachamul the resto shaman can be swapped into a caster group for the duration of Mana Tide but I haven't heard too many casters complaining about mana problems recently.<br>
Buffing DPS helps to kill the mobs faster and save the healers mana at the same time, the quicker you kill it the less time they are healing and the less potion cool downs they can use.</div>

		<div id="post_message_623633">I've determined the exact mechanism behind double-mangled rips.<br>
<br>
There are two kinds of mangles:<br>
<br>
1: Regular mangle.  Rips gain 30% damage while active.<br>
2: Weird mangle: Rips that began during this debuff gain 30% damage throughout their duration.<br>
Both types of mangles affect shred the same.<br>
<br>
Only one type of mangle can be active at once.  But rip can gain the benefit of both at the same time.<br>
<br>
Example:<br>
<br>
- Apply Mangle #2<br>
- Rip<br>
- Wait until Mangle #2 expires.<br>
- Apply Mangle #1<br>
- Now rip is doing 1.3*1.3 damage.<br>
<br>
To apply a "weird" mangle, apply a normal mangle, then mangle again exactly as it expires.  You'll know it works if there is some lag before the debuff shows up on the mob.<br>
<br>
It's important to understand this, not only to take advantage of it, but to avoid bugged rips that aren't affected by mangle.  This will happen if you do the reverse of my example above, and it's very easy to accidentally do.</div>

</div>Except the argument hasn't been "going on for so long"  I really haven't seen anything other than blanked "3x Rogue is the best" from people that aren't even willing to consider a Feral Druid as essential for DPS.  According to the spreadsheets, even if I'm doing DPS in Bearform, RDPS goes up with me in the Melee group instead of a 3rd rogue when considering MT group vs Melee group.  If you think a 350 RDPS increase is minimal that's fine, for people like me, getting an extra 10 is worth it.<br>
<br>
I won't argue that hunter group is better than MT group, as LOTP increases the proc rate of the already high FI.<br>
<br>
As for paladins, looking at Ret Pallies in various top DPS guilds (Abananax for instance) I see Windfury as 5% of a pally's DPS, UR is pretty close to 5% as well, so a Druid is getting more from Melee group than he is.</div>

</div>Drasil's explination of double-rips is spot-on. Very cool. Now we need to determine the ideal rotation to best make use of it. I'm guessing we can only get a double-rip every other time with this. Here's the reverse that would give you a mangleless rip:<br>
<br>
1) Apply Mangle #1<br>
2) When the mangle is almost gone, apply rip.<br>
3) Mangle as soon as Mangle #1 ends, applying Mangle #2<br>
<br>
The rip was applied while under the affects of Mangle #1 (which wore off before the first tick), and Mangle #2 was applied after the rip.<br>
<br>
Also of note: They have different names, so are clearly distinguishable. Mangle #1 (the mangle you normally see) is called '<b>Mangle (Cat)</b>'. Mangle #2 (the mangle you only see if you mangle exactly as Mangle #1 ends) is called '<b>Mangle</b>'. No (Cat) on Mangle #2.</div>

		<div id="post_message_623796">Also, <b>Mangle</b> will get applied if you Mangle at the exact time that either <b>Mangle (Cat)</b> or <b>Mangle</b> ends.<br>
<br>
So lets see... The ideal DPS Rotation would be....<br>
<br>
1) Apply <b>Mangle (Cat)</b>.<br>
2) Shred to 4+cp.<br>
2b) <i>On 2nd+ loops through the rotation, previous Rip wears off here</i><br>
3) Mangle the instant Mangle (Cat) will wear off, to apply <b>Mangle</b>.<br>
4) <b>Rip</b><br>
5) Shred to 4+cp.<br>
6) <b>Rip</b> right before <b>Mangle</b> wears off. <i>(??? Is this right? You clip a Rip tick doing this, and I don't even know if you can always overwrite it like this anyway)</i><br>
7) Start over, applying <b>Mangle (Cat)</b>.<br>
<br>
<br>
That's the best rotation I could come up with. You lose half a single-mangle rip tick per rotation, plus half a rip tick goes unmangled, in exchange for double-mangling every other rip.<br>
<br>
A typical rip tick, fully buffed, with no mangle, for me, would do about 550, conservatively. Using our typical rotation, that would produce, per 2 rotations:<br>
715+715+715+715+715+715+715+715+715+715+715+715 = 8580dmg<br>
<br>
Using the above rotation, you would get...<br>
929.5+929.5+929.5+929.5+929.5+929.5+715+715+715+715+715 = 9152dmg<br>
<br>
That's a 6.66% increase in dps from rip. Worth it?</div>

</div>So would an appropriate interpretation be to not rip if mangle is under 2 sec (maybe 4 sec to be safe)?  It would seem that the standard rip&gt;mangle&gt;shred&gt;shred&gt;rip&gt;mangle... rotation would put you in that situation fairly often.<br>
<br>
I've tried using 5cp rips to overwrite an existing rip but still get a "more powerful spell already in affect" error.  Trying to rip early at 5cp doesn't seem to always work.  A 5cp rip should be able to overwrite an existing 4cp rip though.</div>

<br>
<b>TANK GROUP:</b><br>

<br>
I've looked at one of the rogue spreadsheets to check what Boevis said and after the switch, the feral druid would gain about 150 DPS from Strength of Earth and Unleashed Rage. The members of the melee group would all gain about 64 DPS from Leader of the Pack, that's roughly 250 DPS.  The rogue being swapped would lose 105 from Unleashed Rage, but gain 64 from Leader of the Pack (-41 DPS). The feral druid left in the tank group would also gain about 50 DPS from Strength of Earth.<br>
<br>
After the swap, I'm calculating roughly a 450 DPS increase, which isn't too bad considering all it costs is one rogue Unleashed Rage.<br>
<br>
The biggest concern I have with my argument is, will Windfury be enough to compensate for the destro warlocks losing Tranquil Air? Is the 450 DPS really worth the move? That's about 135k damage over a 5 minute fight. It can be the difference between a 1% wipe and a kill sometimes.</div>

</div>You're also not considering the fact that the tank also sees increased rage generation through the windfury totem. With that as well as careful usage of Soul Shatter from the warlock, you should be fine in the threat department.<br>

To match the insane strength potion over the 120s cooldown(optimistic estimate of 10dps*120s ~= 1200 damage), those 4 hits only need to average about 300 damage(with misses/dodges/glancing/crits factored in), which is easily achievable.

</div>My math was off on this, I was using WF * Average Hit instead of WF/Hits*Total Damage like I should have.  Doing it properly, WF was just under 10% of this paladins DPS, though they had a high number of WF procs (9 with 7.6 being the average for his white attacks), average WF would be 8% of their DPS.  But this isn't an argument about WF, if you run 3 shamans, 2 groups can get WF<br>
<br>
It is very true that Druids get more AP from UR, I don't think that's ever in debate, as for the Value of AP, using the spreadsheets we can see that 1 DPS is about 8.64 AP for top end Rogues, compared to 4.75 AP for druids.  I'll look into Paladins and Warriors in a bit, but I doubt they are lower than 6 AP per DPS.  This is mostly because a large portion of their DPS is from base Weapon DPS, and Flat modifiers to their attacks (or spell damage)</div>

</div>I use an addon called Classtimer and it sometimes didn't show the mangle debuff even when i knew I had it active on the boss.  That's because it was only set up to show Mangle(cat).  I was able to add just Mangle to it and it now shows up whether the Mangle(cat) is active or just the Mangle is active.  Might be a way to easily see which version of Mangle is active without having to mouseover the debuff on the boss all the time.</div>

		<div id="post_message_625615">Not sure if this is known, but while doing some Rage calculations during a debate about Crit vs % Damage and Rage generation for Arms Warriors I discovered a discrepancy in the formula commonly known. As it stands here is the current known formula:<br>
<br>
Damage = Damage delt from white attack<br>
WpnSpeed = BASE Weapon swing speed<br>
Factor = 3.5 MH normal, 7.0 MH crit<br>
<br>
((Damage/274.7)*7.5+(WpnSpeed*Factor))/2 <br>
<br>
What I discovered with multiple tests is that a Druid crit actually uses the NON-Crit Factor in the formula. I realise this isn't a huge deal but I haven't found it documented anywhere. Its easy to test, just go hit something and stick the number in the formula for a non-crit, you'll find its correct while the crit factor wasn't (if you had crit that is). Bug or intended nerf on our rage? Thoughts?</div>

		<div id="post_message_626940">You're right Boevis.<br>
<br>
After doing some math and testing, my rotation turns out to be less DPS than a regular cycle with no double-mangles.<br>
<br>
Astrylian's rotation was better, but won't work due to the fact that you can't override a rip in some siuations (i.e. it's trinketed).  If you add another mangle (step 4b), it works out:<br>
<br>
1) Apply <b>Mangle (Cat)</b>.<br>
2) Shred to 4+cp.<br>
2b) On 2nd+ loops through the rotation, previous Rip wears off here<br>
3) <b>Mangle</b> the instant Mangle (Cat) will wear off, to apply Mangle.<br>
4) <b>Rip</b><br>
4b) <b>Mangle</b><br>
5) Shred to 5+cp.<br>
6) <b>Rip</b> right before Mangle wears off.<br>
7) Start over, applying <b>Mangle (Cat)</b>.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, this still isn't a DPS gain.<br>
<br>
The only time I'm going to use this technique, is if I won't be able to get 5 CP before mangle runs out.  Then I'd start at step 3.</div>

		<div id="post_message_627158">I think, in proper context now, it's more important to avoid getting in a bad mangle scenario than to maximize the good scenarios, i.e. waiting until a mangle expires before you rip so that you don't rip during Mangle(Cat) and overwrite it with a Mangle.  <br>
<br>
Other ideas include offsetting your mangles, or mangling every 8s instead of every 12s, but that's trading shreds for mangles, and I don't think it's worth the difficulty.  And misses/dodges of rips/mangles also have to be minimized-- hit capped with no expertise, the chances of missing a mangle or missing the rip after the mangle is 0.056 + (.944 * 0.056) = 10.9% chance of failure of double-buffing.  <br>
<br>
What might be more interesting is seeing if two druids in the raid can come up with some sort of double-mangling scenario that benefits one or both ferals doubly.  Can Mangle(bear) be overwritten by a second feral's Mangle(cat) to produce a Mangle in a similar method? <br>
<br>
At the very least, I'm happy to discover why my custom Pitbull buffs don't always show my mangle debuffs!</div>

		<div id="post_message_627230">Indeed. The big thing to see is that (at least with only one feral), it's not possible to get more double-mangle rips than 0-mangle rips, using the normal cycle, and that using an abnormal cycle requires too precise timing and has a high failure rate, for a very meager dmg increase, if any at all.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Sure, we have naturally high AP, and UR would add a higher absolute amount of AP for us as opposed to a Rogue. The real question is, can we translate that raw AP to actual DPS more effectively than a Rogue? I'm a huge fan of 2 x Enh Shaman tank/melee groups anyway.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>The answer is yes.<br>
<br>
A rogue gets about 300ap from UR, we get around 500 (at my level, beginning Hyjal/BT).<br>
<br>
On white hits, we get (without counting crits or armor) 7% of our ap into damage per second.<br>
Rogues get a little more because they are dual wielding, 11%.<br>
<br>
So for white hits, we get an additionnal 36 dps, and they get an additionnal 32 dps. The intersting part comes here:<br>
<br>
Their main attack, say as combat, is Sinister Strike. This attack deals 100% of one swing's worth of damage, plus a little bonus. If the rogue uses a 2.6 weapon, 300 ap will add 56 damage to each hit, and in turn <b>56 more damage to each Sinister Strike</b>. Sinister Strike costs 40 energy, and I will compare it to our Shred, which costs 42 energy.<br>
<br>
Our shred inflicts 225% of our base damage, + a fixed value, and then multiplied by 30% thanks to mangle. Since we hit at 1 per second, with 500 ap we get an extra 36 damage per hit. On a Shred, this equals a <b>bonus of 105 damage</b>.<br>
<br>
This is a very crude estimation, but I think it partially goes to the point :p</div>

</div>Not really. Doing "very crude" estimations doesn't get you very far in WoW mechanics terms, you need to think things through and look at everything that's being affected.<br>
<br>
You haven't accounted for white hits for a sword rogue account for 70%+ of their damage, while our white hits being in the range of 30-40% of our total damage. Rogues also gain 30% base haste (slice and dice) and will go for some haste items due to them being best in slot, giving them maybe 40% more gain from the AP on their white hits than we do.</div>

</div>Spreadsheets often [read always] overestimate DPS. <br>
<br>
Without going into maths Balance does have its benefits, +5% crit, + to raid hit, as well as the usual Druid buffs and abilities. As well some fights are not melee friendly, and in these fights the ranged DPS of Balance is very nice. Damage aside, Hurricane is a very nice debuff on AOE pulls [reduces incoming damage].<br>
<br>
From my personal experience Balance in equal gear can do considerably more damage than Feral. A well played Balance Druid should be able to manage their mana effectively anyway, and with the buffs since 2.0 do not have the mana concerns pre-BC [hence Boomkin not Oomkin]</div>

</div>While I agree this is a dps increase of ~ 4 % on your rip dps (including trinkets being used on your "buffed mangles" only) I have some concerns of its repeatibility.<br>
<br>
Having to rip in the last second of the first mangle necessitates having an 11 second cycle becasue you must rip in that final second of the first mangle. This means you have to be at 4 or 5 combo points AND have the energy to Rip-&gt;Mangle immediately. This means in an 11 second cycle you have to start the cycle with 99+ energy and the 5 energy ticks in the 11 seconds to make it work. 1 mangle to start the cycle, 1 mangle and a rip to end it plus 2 shreds in the middle for a minimum of 4 combo points (35+40+40+42+42). <br>
<br>
This would seem like a ton of work and a lot of procs/ticks wasted to ensure the 99 energy necessary to sustain this cycle unless you started into the first mangle with combo points or had two crits, which you "might" with any decent gear, but counting on a crit might sink you. I think overall this cycle lengthens your non-buffed rip cycle, since you have to wait for the non-cat Mangle to wear off, and shortens your double buffed rip cycle, see above. All of this for 4% on 24% (according to my Rawred gear) of your damage for a grand total of .96% dps increase? Personally no thanks.<br>
<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Not really. Doing "very crude" estimations doesn't get you very far in WoW mechanics terms, you need to think things through and look at everything that's being affected.<br>
 <br>
You haven't accounted for white hits for a sword rogue account for 70%+ of their damage, while our white hits being in the range of 30-40% of our total damage. Rogues also gain 30% base haste (slice and dice) and will go for some haste items due to them being best in slot, giving them maybe 40% more gain from the AP on their white hits than we do.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>Pot, kettle.  That's also not the whole picture and is not much less crude.  Let's take this one to our DPS calculators!<br>
<br>
Turning off UR from a older spreadsheet of one of my guild's rogues led to a 94 DPS decrease.  Going from 4500 to 4950 AP on Toskk's (which is what UR would add) with various settings approximating what I have right now gives me a 78 DPS upgrade.   For reference, this is approximately the same ratio the calculator gives for my DPS versus his-- in other words, it's scaling us each about the same overall, but it gives a rogue a bigger DPS gain overall because he does more DPS.   <br>
 <br>
To reiterate: There are fairly simple tools out there for "how much is X worth" for just about every class.  Most of them are already in threads on this forum, in first-posts.  Use them rather than simply estimating.</div>

</div>Aye, it's not really that attractive. But it at least isn't a bad thing, if you do happen to have the crit rate to support it. It's the same rotation as normal, just time the mangles correctly (alternating exact and slightly late). If you do have a 12s cycle normally, it won't increase your cycle time.</div>

</div>What I meant by increased cycle (and I should have included this) was you have to wait for 100 energy as opposed to the 80+ with the traditional cycle, so you have to wait for an additional 2 seconds, not a big deal by any means, just a place to waste energy. <br>
<br>
With the 4 piece Tier 6, this becomes slightly more attractive at around 5.25% ((1.15 + 1.15x1.3x1.3)/2-(1.15x1.3)) increase to rip dps totalling 1.25% total dps increase. So not bad, though I don't know how annoying it will be, and missing just one double mangle will put you behind.</div>

</div>That's some amazing avoidance but it seems the max ilotp heal is 762, which means your max hp was 19050 and your highest hit taken was 10006. From a healing point of view I really wouldn't want my main tank to be someone capable to dying in 2 swings from max hp.<br>
I haven't tanked Teron myself and I'd be interested to see how things would go, but in general I feel warriors have scaled up a lot better than feral druids as gear has improved.

</div>Please try and know what you are talking about. <br>
<br>
Hit rating is important to druids, with the standard (non dual-wielding) miss rate that can be removed by getting Hit Rating (142 or 143 cap)<br>
<br>
Feral combat rating was the feral equivalent to Weapon skill and has been replaced since 2.3 with Expertise. This is also useful to druids.</div>

</div>I'd wager so. My previous raid guild didn't have any Protection Warriors, so we had a Druid maintank (me) all the way from Karazhan to 5/6 and 3/4, as well as for Vashj attempts. I (or one of our other Druids) tanked guild first kills for everything minus Nightbane, Gruul (this was more a matter of petulance though) and Hydross. From what I'm told about MH/BT, the only encounters we can't tank there are RoS (Spell Reflect) and Illidan (Shear, SBlock). I doubt it's possible to be a cutting edge world first guild with a Druid MT, but you can be somewhat competetive. I think WotLK will result in many mechanic changes, including Crushing Blows (Deathknights don't wear shields!) that might put us on a more even level.</div>

Anyway I used to MT a lot until we geared up our only prot warrior, now it just makes more sense for him to MT since I do 2k dps and he does 1k with the same spec.  Should we have not had an amazing, dedicated warrior MT I think we would have been just as successful with a druid, until Illidan anyway. ^^</div>

		<div id="post_message_628362">Wow, that's cool. You're in quite a unique position having successfully tanked 2 so called impossible fights, I wish to leech info from you. Please indulge me. Before we begin, bear in mind I've only done the Kael encounter once for about 90 minutes of learning (up to Ph3 only), and haven't seen RoS or Illidan at all.<br>
<br>
k, from my understanding of the Kael fight, you need a Warrior wearing the legendary shield to absorb the first of 3 pyroblasts he casts. He casts a magical shield on himself which must be burned down asap (80k hp?). He can't be interrupted while the magical shield is active.<br>
<br>
So what a Warrior does is: click his legendary shield, absorbing the first pyroblast, by the time the 2nd is due, Kael's magical shield has been burned through, and then the next 2 pyroblasts are interrupted through standard interrupt mechanisms. Is this accurate?<br>
<br>
And so what you're describing for a Druid is: Barkskin when he starts casting, and eat the first pyroblast outright, reduced to 20k from the normal 25k, then when Kael's shield is burned through, the next 2 pyroblasts are interrupted as normal. Is this accurate?<br>
<br>
If so, the Druid is taking a 20k pyroblast, whilst the Warrior is absorbing it via the shield, taking no damage (I presume). Does the shield absorb the entire spell? Isn't that basically an extra 20k damage the Druid is taking? Help me understand what I'm missing here &gt;&lt; (re: the less damage part).<br>
<br>
For RoS, Warriors need to Spell Reflect Deaden, which makes RoS take double damage. So if I understand you right, if you don't reflect it, then it must be interrupted (or else you'll take double damage, is that accurate?). So if the raid is successfully able to interrupt all the other spells, plus the Deaden, then the only drawback to using a Druid is not having Deaden on RoS for the extra damage. Is that the case? Is it a fatal blow to raid dps by not having Deaden reflected, any enrage timer or something that won't be met?<br>
<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Wow, that's cool. You're in quite a unique position having successfully tanked 2 so called impossible fights, I wish to leech info from you. Please indulge me. Before we begin, bear in mind I've only done the Kael encounter once for about 90 minutes of learning (up to Ph3 only), and haven't seen RoS or Illidan at all.<br>
<br>
k, from my understanding of the Kael fight, you need a Warrior wearing the legendary shield to absorb the first of 3 pyroblasts he casts. He casts a magical shield on himself which must be burned down asap (80k hp?). He can't be interrupted while the magical shield is active.<br>
<br>
So what a Warrior does is: click his legendary shield, absorbing the first pyroblast, by the time the 2nd is due, Kael's magical shield has been burned through, and then the next 2 pyroblasts are interrupted through standard interrupt mechanisms. Is this accurate?<br>
<br>
And so what you're describing for a Druid is: Barkskin when he starts casting, and eat the first pyroblast outright, reduced to 20k from the normal 25k, then when Kael's shield is burned through, the next 2 pyroblasts are interrupted as normal. Is this accurate?<br>
<br>
If so, the Druid is taking a 20k pyroblast, whilst the Warrior is absorbing it via the shield, taking no damage (I presume). Does the shield absorb the entire spell? Isn't that basically an extra 20k damage the Druid is taking? Help me understand what I'm missing here &gt;&lt; (re: the less damage part).<br>

</div>Barkskin will last through 2 Pyroblasts, 3 if you're REALLY good with the timing (barkskin at Second 2 on first pyro, go bear RIGHT away, failure to do so will kill you)<br>
<br>
For RoS, you don't need deaden to kill him. However, you need REALLY good dps to burn through Essence of Desire without deaden since you're on a 140 second(confirm?) countdown to zero mana.</div>

		<div id="post_message_628383">I believe ROS phase 2 is 3 minutes until zero mana, but the difference isn't that important.  Missing deadens will force your DPS to work that much harder.  It's certainly possible, but doing that for a first kill as opposed to having farmed t6 for a few weeks would be an impressive feat.  If you reflect every deaden perfectly you will increase raid DPS roughly 25%.  It's not a trivial buff.<br>
<br>
I've picked up kael in phase 5 after the warrior MT died and that's about as close as I want to get to tanking him   I would like if my guild was a bit more open minded about letting me do bosses like Archimonde (I've tanked the other 4 in hyjal at least once) but a lot of people still have the idea that fear immediately disqualifies a feral tank, which is a shame.<br>
<br>
As for crushing blows, a lot of high end bosses don't crush anymore.  Azalgor, Archimonde can't.  I don't think mother Shaz can either.  I may be missing a few others, but it's fairly arbitrary.  Illidan can crush, though.  I would be interested in seeing what they will do about it with death knights coming into the picture.  I was considering making one, but in the end I'm afraid they're going to end up just like feral druids: always second choice.</div>

</div>Warriors routinely eat a pyroblast that they take no damage from thanks to the legendary shield's use effect.<br>
<br>
Back before they nerfed the HP of the shock barrier, taking a second pyro was not uncommon, and survivable due to Improved Defensive Stance plus stuff like Nightmare Seeds/Fire Prot pots/Last Stand plus PW:S.  These days you should only take a pyroblast if you've got bad things going on (e.g. bad phoenix timing, mind control, advisors up, or dead raiders leading to reduced DPS).  But bad things do happen.<br>
<br>
While you should be able to heal your tank up to full between pyroblasts, PW:S and fire prot will only take the edge off one of the two pyroblasts you could potentially take, and Nightmare Seed has a 3 minute cooldown.  Barkskin will help obviously but it will be close if you take a pyroblast at the upper end of the damage range.<br>
<br>
If you can guarantee interrupting before the second pyroblast then tanking Kael is very doable but it's really suboptimal unless Kael's legitimately on farm.<br>
<br>
[NB:  If you're taking a third Pyro then your interrupters suck because the shock barrier only lasts for 10 seconds, and pyroblast has a 4 second cast time.]</div>

		<div id="post_message_628465">I meant you would take less damage per pyro that hits you, not less damage overall.  Easier to survive the burst+something else random happening.  The pyro will hit you for 20% less damage vs a warriors 15.5% and you will have 2-3k more hp at that gear level.  I don't remember the last time I actually tanked Kael, but it was probably last summer sometime and we have gone back once since.  It's extremely easy for a couple paladins to time 2 heals to land between pyros.  At the time I just ate both pyros since we never broke it before the 2nd one and it was smooth unless I didn't hit barkskin and then bear form ^^.<br>
As for RoS, one of the first Asian kills I believe had them blowing lusts and whatnot for p2 instead of p3 and they interrupted all deadens.  It's definitely possible for a progression guild, though of course it's not optimal.  We had a good 20s left on the p2 timer tonight without CoR, vs our normal 60s+ left, so about a 40s loss.  <br>
<br>
Anyway the point wasn't to discuss what is optimal, just what is possible.   In our specific case I don't think we gained much by having a warrior vs druid MT the last year until Illidan.</div>

For a druid to reach really high avoidance levels we have to sacrafice huge levels of hp as well as some armour; itemisation for us really hasn't let us scale very well at all from t4 level to t6 level. Warrior itemisation is so good they can maintain massive avoidance levels and still have lots of hp, defensive stance, block value, the ability to stop crushes and decently itemised expertise to really cut into boss parries. They also have reactive abilities which <i>will</i> give them over 27k hp.</div>

Unless you specifically gem your equipment for it, your dodge won't increase as fast as mitigation via sta/armor so it all tends to balance out as long as you are taking on stuff suitable for your general equipment level.<br>

Keep your gear balanced and not too biased towards dodge at the expense of stamina/armor and you shouldnt have many issues. The only fight where I really gear for dodge specifically is tanking the rogue at Illidari Council.</div>

</div>For bosses, it's not a problem as long as you got 1) good AP 2) good crit rate. ZA bosses hit hard enough that you shouldn't have any problem with holding aggro. Normally the more dodge you get it through getting more agility which automatically gives you higher crit rate and more rage. If you are rage starved then stop mauling and don't miss any white hits. Normally if I go under 50 rage I will just swipe/mangle spam because its so rage cheap when having a good crit rate, then maul again if I have enough. Then again ZA mobs hit hard enough that you shouldn't ever have a problem. There's no dodge cap as long as you feel comfortable with your rage generation.</div>

</div>I didn't conclude that it swung either way; my intention was to point out that there are a lot more factors to take into account and you can easily bias it the other way by only looking at one other aspect (although re-reading it, it isn't clear, I admit).<br>
<br>
MTing RoS isn't really a problem once you get geared up, but learning the fight without deaden must be painful in the extreme. I would also say that a good warrior &gt; good druid, mainly because of cooldowns rather than straight damage taken, although when you're on 'deep farm' content they should be pretty much equal.</div>

Unless you specifically gem your equipment for it, your dodge won't increase as fast as mitigation via sta/armor so it all tends to balance out as long as you are taking on stuff suitable for your general equipment level.<br>
<br>
Keep your gear balanced and not too biased towards dodge at the expense of stamina/armor and you shouldnt have many issues. The only fight where I really gear for dodge specifically is tanking the rogue at Illidari Council.</div>

</div>Even on early TK progression you run into starvation on VR, but this is part of the encounter mechanic to have more tank exchanges. I need to hold enrage on CD to stay close to the other tanks, even when I have aggro.</div>

Consider, at 0 avoidance, druids will take less damage 85% of the time, and noticably more damage 15% of the time on crushings.

</div>We've been running short on Protection Warriors lately (MT having computer issues), so I MT'd the bulk of our Hyjal/BT bosses this week. My guild is up to Shahraz in BT and has cleared Hyjal, so we are not completely decked out in T6, but our regular MT is fairly well geared.<br>
<br>
Like Shiggles, I'd always believed that an equally geared Prot Warrior would take less damage overall on a typical fight where the boss is capable of crushing blows. I've always been used to MT Azgalor, but other encounters normally been tanked by our first string Prot Warrior. After reading Shiggles' post, I decided to compare myself to our MT on the Teron Gorefiend, Naj'entus, and Archimonde fights. I expected I would be taking slightly more damage on Gorefiend/Naj'entus (with smaller spikes on Gorefiend), with less overall damage on Archimonde. Note that on all three fights I had a warrior present to keep up Improved TC, but did not have Grace of Air.<br>
<br>
On Naj'entus, my average hit was 3027, with a max hit of 6005. I avoided 51.2% of attacks. I took an average 965 DPS during the fight. Our regular Prot War MT's average hit was 3236, with a max hit of 7687. He took an average of 1031 DPS during the fight. Note that the Naj'entus calculations include tidal shield damage in overall incoming DPS, but not max hit.<br>
<br>
On Gorefiend, my average hit was 6509, with a max of 9870. I took an average of 1442 incoming DPS. Our regular Prot War MT's average hit was 6979, with a max hit of 12422. His average incoming DPS was 1477.<br>
<br>
On Archimonde (note that soul charge/doomfire damage is not included - I did not take any DF when tanking anyway), my average hit was 5078, with a max of 7005. I took an average of 838 incoming DPS. Prot Warrior MT took an average hit of 6534, with a max of 8617. His average incoming DPS was 1225. I expected to take less damage than a Prot Warrior on this fight, but not quite this much. Note that the average DPS values here are somewhat skewed (though skewed equally) as the time spent for the wisps to blow up Archimonde is included in the calculation.<br>
<br>
Overall, I am surprised and happy that the results show that if you have a warrior to keep debuffs up, a similarly geared Feral Druid is on a level playing field with a Protection Warrior on typical fights that don't require Spell Reflect. Of course, this is not nearly enough data to say anything definitive. I'd certainly not be afraid to use a Feral tank to MT a fight like Gorefiend however, and would certainly recommend using a Feral MT for Archimonde if you have the Fear Wards available.<br>

</div>I think some of your assumptions are off.  Druids don't hit armor cap with T4, unless there's a pally in your group and you're chugging ironskins.  If a druid's mitigation is 75% and a warrior's is 62.5%, the druid's crushing blows will be equal to the warrior's regular hits.  Now, I don't know the relative mitigations across the tiers, but based on those numbers, I think people are WAY over emphasizing crushing blows on a druid.<br>
<br>
I understand your analysis of avoidance, but I'm sure other classes have their own problems too.  Like I've seen some T6 warriors that have enough block/parry/dodge/miss to start eating into crushing blows by itself. Oh no, their shield block ability is becoming useless!  I know, it's nowhere near the same magnitude, but even if this avoidance gap continues and in the end druids take 10% more damage across the board because all hits are crushes, it's not the worst thing.  We offer a lot more to the raid, and very few guilds bring ferals to JUST be an MT.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>The Teron max hit to the Warrior was obviously a crush (and the only one he took the whole fight) - that said, Teron hits fast enough that with parry haste a warrior will get crushed occasionally with perfect shield block usage. I suppose  then it is fair to say that on fights where warriors are crushable due to mob attack speed/parries they will take far worse spikes then Ferals, but take them less often. Hard to say which of these is worse if the total incoming DPS to the tank is comparable (which in my cases, it was).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_629592"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I would've thought it hard to avoid getting crushed on Teron/Najentus, because of the turn-parry thing that happens when they target people behind them. <br>
<br>
On top of that, pure incoming DPS isn't really what should be looked at. Spike damage is the main thing, and that doesn't mean the biggest hit. Sure, warriors can be crushed, but if they get crushed more than once in a row then there's something significantly wrong. A druid can do <i>nothing</i> to avoid getting crushed 2 or 3 times in a row, which is a hell of a lot more spike damage than a warrior should take, even assuming you take 25% less damage than they are on a crushing because of armour differences. Spike damage is not judged by looking at the worst hit, it's looking at the worst case scenario for a particular string of hits. This is also not taking into account last stand/shield wall, which a warrior can fall back on most of the time in cases of emergency, and have more than once ended up with getting our raid a kill when it looked like it was all over, and numerous times provided a buffer that's saved the MT during a silence or similar raid wide fuckup.<br>
<br>
I do agree that ferals are no-where near useless though, and in a tight spot can amply act as the MT, especially on farm content.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_629954"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I'm working on some data collection at the moment, hope to post this weekend.<br>
<br>
I'll be using two different sets of gear.<br>
"NoMiss" = 142 hit rating, 94 expertise rating, 42.51% crit on character sheet with LotP<br>
"FullMiss" = 0 hit rating, 0 expertise rating, don't have the crit rating in front of me, but should be roughly similar.<br>
<br>
I'll be doing 4 tests, of hopefully a few thousand hits each:<br>
<br>
1) Blasted Lands Servant - NoMiss gear with LotP<br>
2) Blasted Lands Servant - NoMiss gear without LotP<br>
<br>
3) ZG Snake Boss - FullMiss gear<br>
4) ZG Snake Boss - NoMiss gear<br>
Possibly: 5) ZG Snake Boss - NoMiss gear, with as different of an amount of crit as possible, while remaining hit/exp capped.<br>
<br>
1/2 will be to test whether LotP is working. Measured Crit% should be higher than character sheet, cause it's a low level mob, but the difference between 1 and 2 should be 5% if LotP is working correctly.<br>
<br>
3/4/5 will be to test crit% vs bosses, to see if it's 2 roll, etc.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>We've used feral tanks on many of the MH and BT fights, some through design and some through happenstance. And it isn't just for farmed content. We learned Teron with me as feral tank after our MT prot warrior's connection dropped an hour into attempts. We always tank Mother with a feral because she does not crushing blow. We learned Council with me on Gathios because we only had one prot warrior in the raid that night and used him on the priest as an additional spell interrupt. We even typically use one on Kaz'rogal - we had one night where for some reason the prot warrior was just taking huge damage spikes for no apparent reason so we switched to a feral, downed him, and never looked back. There is something to be said for what our healers claim is more steady damage input. However, I don't think it stacks up in the long term against the extra "oh shit" buttons, shield reflect and other goodies that Warriors have. Which is fine with me - I like having the freedom of tanking on some fights and dpsing on others.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Assuming a 50% proc rate, it would have an uptime of approximately 40% (assuming one mangle per 12.5 seconds). 65*0.4 = 26 agility, or ~30 AP + 1.1% crit raid buffed, as a 'virtual' static value.

		<div id="post_message_631172"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->FYI: I did test #1 (above) yesterday, and am part-way through test #2 today... Not done yet, but so far it looks like LotP is working. Crit % is currently 4.6% off from test #1, which is within the expected margin of error of only having done 800 hits so far. (Yesterday's test, #1, was for 6700 hits, almost 2 hrs of straight autoattacking)<br>
<br>
EDIT: This isn't to say that we aren't seeing unexpected crit reduction on bosses, just that it does look like LotP isn't to blame. Perhaps Sharpened Claws? I'd think that if bosses just had a large chunk of innate crit reduction, that other classes would be equally affected, which it doesn't sound like is the case.<br>
<br>
EDIT 3: Up to 5000 hits, still looks like LotP works. At 4.9% off from test #1 now. Aiming for the same number of hits as in test #1, 6700.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_631357"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Just finished Test #2 above.<br>
<br>
I performed 2 tests:<br>
<br>
Using a static set of gear, with 142 hit rating and 94 expertise rating, I tested white attacks against Blasted Lands Servants. The difference between the tests was whether LotP was on or not.<br>
<br>
For test #1, the one with LotP on, I just auto-attacked for nearly 2 hours, for a total of 6700 attacks.<br>
<br>
For test #2, the one with LotP off, I right-clicked LotP off, and auto attacked. Due to having no healing without LotP, I periodically turned auto attack off, waited a sec for lag, shifted out, healed, shifted back, right-clicked LotP off again, waited a sec for lag, and then turned auto attack back on. I stopped after nearly 2 hours, for a total of 6700 attacks.<br>
<br>
I have combat logs of both, and used Recount to count the #s of crits and hits. No other swing results (parry, dodge, glance) were observed, as expected.<br>
<br>
<b>Results</b><br>
Test #1: 45.268657% Crit (3033 crit, 3667 hit)<br>
Test #2: 40.179104% Crit (2692 crit, 4008 hit)<br>
Difference: 5.089553% Crit<br>
<br>
I don't know the Statistics of it, I'll leave that to someone else, but that seems pretty clear that LotP is working, so the crit reduction we're observing is coming from somewhere else. The ~0.09% variance from what we expected seems reasonable.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

12 weapon damage is the equivalent of ~144 AP iirc. Add the 14 crit rating (~0.63% crit) and it's quite a decent buff, even if you were using <a class="q2" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=18262" target="_blank">[Elemental Sharpening Stone]</a>'s before.<br>

We've recently lost two protection warriors to casualitis and are down to 1 protection Warrior, 1 protection Paladin, and 1 feral Druid.  Not knowing exactly what to expect, I luckily chose HP gear over avoidance (considering I can't reflect SoB and other spell damage) however I was tempted to wear my avoidance gear considering he can't crush.<br>

Pretty rough burst damage (ignoring the failure of our resto Druids):<br>

Now we can use 2pc t4 AND 4pc t6. Overpowered beyond compare?<br>
<br>
 I'm not really impressed with the items themselves other than the boots, which are amazing. Compared to Insidious Bands / Don Alejandro Money Belt the belt/bracer seems to be suchhh small upgrades its almost barely worth mentioning!<br>
<br>
Also should we assume that they scaled weightstones properly in the same way weapon damage has in the past for druids (Ex: Crystalforged) ? It might be scaled down in some strange way, because it seems like a HUGE boost if not.<br>

look at that leather chest.. and those pants! socket those bad boys with x3 10 agi. <br>
<br>
edit2: of course there are even tons more items that are also amazing offpieces. The "furry hunter" hat seems to be amazing for tanking, too. I imagine we'll be pretty busy for the nezt little while.. PAGING TOSSK!<br>
Must figure out best possible 2pc t4 + 4 pc t6 + 2 offpieces... rarr.... it seems once again that the rogue vs feral pieces, the rogue ones blow out the feral ones for pure DPS and the feral ones are significant tanking upgrades.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Blizzard has stated in the past they wanted to reduce the randomness caused by crushing blows, maybe they have removed them entirely?  This could significantly alter our burst damage taken, however this seems like a big change to not put in the official notes.

Its just a clarification of an old line of text description in the game.  No change to any mechanics, just a more accurate wording.<br>
<br>
<br>
@seminarca<br>
<br>
Defense does reduce the chance of crushings.  It doesn't directly reduce it as it does crit change, but defense adds dodge and miss chance (as well as parry/block for others) and if you can get those numbers to add up high enough, you push crushings off the hit table.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>You're very right, I always forget its an indirect reduction through avoidance for warriors.  To say it doesn't reduce the chance of crushing blows though is somewhat off because parry/block/dodge/miss contributes to not being crushed.  Through shield block or getting their avoidance high enough warriors push crushings off the table, not through defense.<br>
<br>
I was getting myself caught up on the patch notes and read through quickly, was excited at the possibility of no crushing blows for tanking =(<br>

		<div id="post_message_632838"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Re: avoidance vs crushing.<br>
<br>
I wouldn't really say that adding avoidance reduces chance to be crushed. You're looking at avoidance levels of ~86.2%+ before you start pushing crushings off the attack table. It's misleading at best, especially in context of the old defense line ("makes monsters less likely to land a crushing blow") .. to me that doesn't seem to imply "hey! if you get your avoidance high enough, you'll start pushing crushings off the table" but more like it reduces the % chance directly, which is obviously not the case.<br>
<br>
Anyway, we are not likely to see crushing mechanic changes until WotLK, that's when they'll need to deal with the Deathknight issue.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
EDIT2: Personally leaning towards Druid Helm/Shoulders + Rogue Chest/Legs + T6 Gloves (4 piece), No idea, I'll let the pro's do the extensive math vs. 2pc t4 Etc.<br>
<br>
EDIT3:<br>
<br>
Money Belt -----&gt; T6 = +4 ap, -0.82% crit, +1.39% hit<br>
Insidious -------&gt; T6 = -2 ap,  -0.08% crit, +91 A-Pen<br>
Shadowmaster -&gt; T6 = -10 ap, -0.96% crit, +1.25% less Dodge/Parry<br>
<br>
I mean really it doesn't look that bad at all to maintain the T6 bonus which is arguably more or less the same as 2pc-t4 in the first place.... which you get to keep for the price of virtually no ap and 2% crit while also gaining +1.4% hit, 91 A-Pen (going to be nasty with the 6.5+new weapon), and much needed Expertise.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

In regards to hit, you might opt to use a few of the "rogue-oriented" pieces instead (see previous post with image). In regards to a tanking staff, there won't be one, and there is no real need for one, this is it, no more high-end BC instances, they will throw us a really nice DPS staff which makes a hell of a lot more sense.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_632906"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Well the way I see it, T6 will be completely replaced with the new armor set for tanking.  The thing is, its also pretty good for DPSing too, and since it will be a while till you can get rogue dps stuff, it will be your DPS set too.  <br>
<br>
I know I'm going to replace my boots with the T6.5 stuff, so I'm going to lose 22 hit in catform from losing the Ninja boots.  The question is whether to lose the bracer or the belt to keep the T6 2 peice bonus.  Losing the S3 bracers for tanking is out of the question because the resilance is so important to me being uncritable.  And teron bracers are pretty nice for dps too (again I'd hate to lose that hit rating).  <br>
<br>
And with yet another Tier of gear coming out, I feel worse and worse about keeping 2 peice T4.  I get the feeling everyone in shat looks at me wierd because everything is BT quality except for my T4 sticking out like a sore thumb.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_633026"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Since Sunwell'll be the last instance of tBC, it looks like Blizzard decided to milk their itemization formulas for all they're worth this time. As you prolly know, the more of one stat that you stack on an item, the more each point 'costs' in terms of itemization points. So, you can make really good items overall by spreading itemization points out among multiple stats. Well get ready, cause here come items with bonus armor, agility, stamina, hit rating, attack power, armor penetration, triple sockets, strength, expertise. You name it, these items have it.<br>
<br>
<i><b>NOTE:</b> The comparisons included here are compared to the current top gear as of T6, according to Rawr.</i><br>
<br>
<font size="5"><b>Bear</b></font><br>
<font size="4">Head</font><br>
<b>Mask of the Furry Hunter</b> <i>(611ac, 50agi, 58sta, RM+6sta)</i> - This will be the new top bear helm. Huge upgrade over T6, helm, roughly 15% better.<br>
<b>Quad Deathblow X44 Goggles</b> <i>(326ac, 61aci, 47sta, MB+4agi)</i> - The new T2 Engineering goggles, these will be ideal for a hit-immune set. Compared to T6, you lose a good chunk of survivability, but gain alot of avoidance.<br>
<br>
<font size="4">Neck</font><br>
<i>No upgrades found so far</i><br>
<br>
<font size="4">Shoulders</font><br>
<b>Demontooth Shoulderpads</b> <i>(484ac, 38agi, 38sta, RB+3agi)</i> - The new top bear shoulders. Tied for mitigation with T6, and adds 13% more survivability.<br>
<br>
<font size="4">Back</font><br>
<i>No upgrades found so far</i><br>
<br>
<font size="4">Chest</font><br>
<b>Harness of Carnal Instinct</b> <i>(727ac, 44agi, 64sta, RYB+4agi)</i> - The new top bear chest. Roughly a 10% upgrade in mitigation and survival. It does have a bit less armor than T6, but makes up for it in agi/sta.<br>
<br>
<font size="4">Wrists</font><br>
<b>Thunderheart Wristguards</b> <i>(264ac, 28agi, 39sta, R+3sta)</i> - They added 3 more items to all the T6 sets, and this is the first one. And wow is it an upgrade. Other than anticrit, these babies are better in every way than the previous best bracers. A stellar <b>46%</b> boost from Vindicator's Dragonhide Bracers.<br>
<br>
<font size="4">Hands</font><br>
<b>Gloves of the Forest Drifter</b> <i>(539ac, 34agi, 45sta, RB+3agi)</i> - The new top bear gloves. Better in every way then T6, a nice 20% upgrade.<br>
<b>Shadowed Gauntlets of Paroxysm</b> <i>(252ac, 41agi, 33sta, RB+3agi)</i> - Another high-dodge option, these gloves will provide the most agi of any gloves, excellent for hit-immunity.<br>
<br>
<font size="4">Waist</font><br>
<b>Thunderheart Waistguard</b> <i>(319ac, 40agi, 34sta, R+3sta)</i> - The 2nd new T6 piece, this'll be the new best bear belt. A little light in armor, but a good chunk of agi more than before. A 15% upgrade from Belt of Natural Power.<br>
<br>
<font size="4">Legs</font><br>
<b>Leggings of the Immortal Beast</b> <i>(765ac, 45agi, 66sta, RRB+4agi)</i> - Wha-bam. These are huge. Nearly a 50% increase in mitigation. A decent chunk more stamina and armor too. Compared to T6, they're a whopping <b>38% increase</b>, and that's in one of the huge slots, the legs!<br>
<br>
<font size="4">Feet</font><br>
<b>Thunderheart Treads</b> <i>(515ac, 35agi, 54sta, R+3sta)</i> - The 3rd new T6 piece, these are once again great. They're nearly identical to Treads of the Den Mother, except with a bit more agi, a bunch more stam, and a socket. A cool 26% upgrade from Treads of the Den Mother.<br>
<br>
<font size="4">Finger</font><br>
<i>No upgrades found so far</i><br>
<br>
<font size="4">Trinket</font><br>
<i>No upgrades found so far</i><br>
<br>
<font size="4">Weapon</font><br>
<i>No upgrades found so far</i><br>
<br>
So there are a bunch of very solid bear upgrades. So what does this all add up to? Without even using any items that are high-dodge, with full consumables, not supposed to be tank items, we'll hit 87.5% dodge. Throw on some high-dodge jewelry and give us Imp GoA, and we can hit 98% dodge. Switch to 1-2 of the new high-dodge items, and we'll be unhittable. And with 3000ap and 55% crit, aggro won't be a problem either. T7 looks to make bears the premier tank for physical damage.<br>
<br>
<br>
<font size="5"><b>Cat</b></font><br>
<font size="4">Head</font><br>
<b>Duplicitous Guise</b> <i>(43agi, 126ap, 34haste, 30hit, 57sta, MR+4hit)</i> - This yummy new helm surpasses Cursed Vision of Sargeras as the top cat dps helm, pumping out 12dps more.<br>
<b>Mask of the Furry Hunter</b> <i>(50agi, 50str, 30crit, 58sta, RM+6sta)</i> - While much better for tanking, this helm is still great for dps, beatting out anything currently in the game, other than Cursed Vision of Sargeras.<br>
<b>Quad Deathblow X44 Goggles</b> <i>(61agi, 104ap, 24hit, 47sta, MB+4agi)</i> - The new engineering goggles. Almost as good as Cursed Vision of Sargeras, and crafted!<br>
<br>
<font size="4">Neck</font><br>
<b>Hard Khorium Choker</b> <i>(150pen, 58ap, 29haste, 42sta)</i> - Slightly more dps than Choker of Endless Nightmares, AND a huge chunk of stam? Yes please! However, it's jewelcrafter-only. It's made from non-raid mats, though, so it's probably a BoE pattern, just like the SSC/TK boots.<br>
<br>
<font size="4">Shoulders</font><br>
<b>Demontooth Shoulderpads</b> <i>(38agi, 38sta, 38str, 105pen, 20crit, RB+3agi)</i> - The new T7 shoulders are the best for both bear and cat. Nearly a 23dps upgrade over Shoulderpads of the Stranger.<br>
<b>Shoulderpads of Vehemence</b> <i>(33agi, 90ap, 30haste, 26hit, 45sta)</i> - These shoulders are a very slight upgrade over Shoulderpads of the Stranger, but most likely are currently bugged. Of all the new leather items, these are the only ones with no sockets, and they also happen to seem underpowered. Most likely Blizz forgot the sockets on these, and they'll end up being the best cat shoulders.<br>
<br>
<font size="4">Back</font><br>
<i>No upgrades found so far</i><br>
<br>
<font size="4">Chest</font><br>
<b>Bladed Chaos Tunic</b> <i>(42agi, 210pen, 120ap, 38crit, 45sta, BYR+8ap)</i> - The new top cat chest. A major 33dps upgrade over Nether Shadow Tunic.<br>
<b>Carapace of Sun and Shadow</b> <i>(42agi, 120ap, 38haste, 30hit, 45sta, YRR+8ap)</i> - While not quite as much of an upgrade as Bladed Chaos Tunic (only 29dps), this new chest is probably going to be alot easier to attain; it's a BoP leatherworking item, made from non-raid mats. Most likely it'll be just like the boot patterns from TK/SSC, a BoE pattern.<br>
<b>Harness of Carnal Instinct</b> <i>(44agi, 196pen, 64sta, 52str, RYB+4agi)</i> - The new bear chest also is no slouch at dps, a 10dps upgrade over Nether Shaqdow Tunic. <br>
<br>
<font size="4">Wrists</font><br>
<b>Thunderheart Wristguards</b> <i>(28agi, 91pen, 28str, 39sta, R+3sta)</i> - The new top bear bracers are also the new top cat bracers. A 4dps upgrade over Insideous. We'll probably still want to dps with insideous, and enchant these for tanking though.<br>
<br>
<font size="4">Hands</font><br>
<b>Gloves of Immortal Dusk</b> <i>(30agi, 154pen, 90ap, 30crit, 33sta, RR+3crit)</i> - The other new crafted leatherworking item, these gloves are the new best for cats. However, they're made using raid drops, similar to the SSC/TK belts. An incredible 38dps upgrade over Grips of Damnation!<br>
<b>Shadowed Gauntlets of Paroxysm</b> <i>(41agi, 82ap, 30haste, 33sta, RB+3agi)</i> - Another solid cat upgrade without the rough crafting cost. 23dps up from Grips of Damnation.<br>
<b>Gloves of the Forest Drifter</b> <i>(34agi, 140pen, 45sta, 34str, RB+3agi)</i> - Almost as good as the previous gloves, they're a 19dps upgrade over Grips of Damnation.<br>
<br>
<font size="4">Waist</font><br>
<b>Thunderheart Waistguard</b> <i>(40agi, 22hit, 34sta, 38str, R+3sta)</i> - These are only a tiny dps upgrade over Belt of One-Hundred Deaths, if we're not hit capped. If we are hit capped, which we probably will be, Belt of One-Hundred Deaths will still be better. However, we may still want this belt for the set bonuses.<br>
<br>
<font size="4">Legs</font><br>
<b>Leggings of the Immortal Night</b> <i>(41agi, 224pen, 124ap, 32hit, 48sta, RRR+4agi)</i> - Would you like some dps with your dps? Jeezus, these are nice. 45dps upgrade from Shady Dealer's Pantaloons, if we're not hit capped, and still 35-40dps upgrade if we are. "RRR+4agi" is so nice looking. <br>
<b>Leggings of the Immortal Beast</b> <i>(46agi, 169pen, 66sta, 44str, RRB+4agi)</i> - Still an upgrade over Shady Dealer's Pantaloons, by 19dps, but we'd probably want to gem/enchant these for tanking.<br>
<br>
<font size="4">Feet</font><br>
<b>Thunderheart Treads</b> <i>(35agi, 20exp, 54sta, 35str, R+3sta)</i> - A slight dps downgrade from Shadowmaster's Boots, but with a bunch more sta, and exp to help maintain a steady cycle.<br>
<br>
<font size="4">Finger</font><br>
<b>Hard Khorium Band</b> <i>(30agi, 58ap, 28haste, 42sta)</i> - Slightly more dps than Signet of Primal Wrath, this jewelcrafted ring is similar to the SSC/TK belts in that it requires raid mats.<br>
<br>
<font size="4">Trinket</font><br>
<i>No upgrades found so far</i><br>
<br>
<font size="4">Weapon</font><br>
<b>Stanchion of Primal Instinct</b> <i>(47agi, 350pen, 1197ap, 50sta, 75str)</i> - Finally, a well itemized cat weapon since the Stranglestaff. <b>This is a 99dps upgrade over Staff of Primal Fury. Wow.</b><br>
<br>
So, with all these cat upgrades, with no new cloak, 1 ring, and no new trinkets, we're looking at a 283dps upgrade, roughly. Not too shabby. In the end, we end up with much more hit rating that we need, so drop one of the rogue-ish pieces, probably the shoulders, for T6, to pick up the 4T6 bonus. It's interesting to note that with this armor in the game, there'll finally be enough of an upgrade to drop 2T4. It's crazy that our very first raiding set bonus of the expansion will have reigned as the best cat set bonus of all sets, for probably 15 months. <br>

I am a little skeptical about the rogue-oriented shoulders and helm. Even after they are fixed you are more or less weighing 5% haste vs 6% crit. If you have run any numbers with haste to show in high-end gear what kind of effect 5% haste would have on dps vs. 6% crit it would be nice.<br>
<br>
Rogue-oriented chest and legs are clearly superior to the druid-counterparts. Also leaning towards gloves as the piece to keep.<br>
<br>

</div>Haste affects white damage only (30-40% total damage), with an increase in proc chance equal to the haste you gain (OoC/2t4). <br>
Crits affect all damage, as while it doesn't directly affect rip, it affects combo point generation which should cause an increase in uptime.<br>
<br>
Putting some relatively high end stats into Toskk's comes back with these numbers (this is with 4t6, not 2t4).<br>
Crit Rating:AP = 2.0732546558060343<br>
Haste Rating:AP = 1.6990399269696146<br>

		<div id="post_message_633078"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->A lot of that Feral loot is impressive, although I would of liked even more expertise. The 1:1 agi/sta ratios, the nice gains in stam, and the nice socket bonuses (omg agi) are great.<br>
<br>
It seems they finally want us to tank and DPS in the same gear -- and provided itemization to get it done. Lets admit it, multiple unique end-game sets is really stupid, from both an itemization standpoint and from the concept of a Feral druid.  However, it still looks like we'll have a problem getting uncritable.<br>
<br>
I feel the Sunwell armor in general, and on the T6 bracers and T6 belt could have a bit more armor value.  At least so its not an armor downgrade, although the considerable gains in stamina and agility and the EXPERTISE is very very nice. (Are all the armor values properly adjusted with item level?  Even the regular armor seems a bit low.)<br>
<br>
I wish the weapon would be for tanking.  Something with a ton of stamina, agility, armor, expertise, defense, and some sockets.  Because I'm happy enough with S3/S4 for DPS.<br>
<br>
DPS-wise, the new stones + 2/5 T4 + 4/5 T6 will be extremely nice (assuming it beats the new pieces).  However, I'm more looking forward to having 1 set of gear that works for mostly everything (maybe just changing rings/trinkets for tanking).  The gains in stamina sorta make it seem like we could gem avoidance/dps and still have a decent HP pool.  Although from a pure DPS standpoint the rogue set isn't bad for us either.  OMG 3-socketed feral legs &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3<br>
<br>
The new Sunwell chest has a bit more str then agi, this should probably be ticketed on the PTR because it goes against all the other pieces.   The crit on the helm would probably be much better as expertise or hit.  They really could 1/2 the intellect on all those pieces and provide an additional stat like hit or tiny armor gains.<br>
<br>

</div>This is exactly what I came to post. Expertise is undoubtedly a great tanking stat yet its on only <i>one</i> of our 8 new "Tank- oriented" items and none of our talents or racials and we've really been left behind.<br>

		<div id="post_message_633257"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Threw the new loot into my spreadsheet.  It looks like the best options for DPS are as follows.<br>
<br>
Thunderheart Cover<br>
Mantle of Malorne (I know you didn't want to hear that)<br>
Bladed Chaos Tunic<br>
Thunderheart Wristguards<br>
Gauntlets of Malorne (Damn you set bonuses that scale so well with gear)<br>
Thunderheart Waistguard<br>
Leggints of the Immortal Night<br>
Thunderheart Treads<br>
<br>
<br>
Also worth noting - The Shard of Contempt (assuimg a 25% uptime on the proc) is by far better than any other DPS trinket available.  (Including the almighty DST)<br>
<br>
<br>
Also: For those of you who managed to get onto the PTR already.... Please submit the Pillar of Ferocity as bugged until they change the 47 STR into AGI.  It would make this item a decent tanking stick, which is clearly the intent based on the other stats on the weapon.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_633384"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->On a more general note, another bonus of gaining T6 bonuses on outside of the core 5 pieces, is that they could effectively be used with PvP gear.  At the cost of resilience (although considering ferals probably have multiple sets of T6 anyway, so you could gem for resilence), you could get -5 energy on Mangle, 15% dmg on Rip, Swipe, and FB --- and keep 15% speed in forms.  Sounds pretty sweet.<br>
<br>
Now only if they did the same with S3 honor Belt/Bracer/Boot + S3 arena gear.  2/5 T5 FTW!<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
It's plain we reached the armor cap far too quickly in TBC. In my mind, if armor mitigation is to be the sole mechanic for Ferals to reduce damage on physical hits, armor progression for us should look something like:<br>
<br>
[start]: 50% Mitigation from Armor<br>
{insert some species of linear/exponential/logarithmic progression}<br>
[end]: 75% Mitigation from Armor<br>
<br>
Where [start] is a Bear ready to tank the first raid instance upon hitting level cap (MC, Kara, Naxx25), having farmed all the requisite 5 mans to prepare for it, and [end] is a Bear with the highest possible armor, going out of her way specifically for high armor items farmed from the last raid instance (Naxx, Sunwell, whatever it ends up being in WotLK).<br>
<br>
Not reaching 75% mitigation until the very end means:<br>
* You're still progressing (gaining in power) all the way until the end.<br>
* You have OPTIONS. You don't necessarily have to go for 75% mitigation, you can mix it up if you want.<br>
* If you absolutely do need to reduce the damage taken from physical attacks, you have some room to add armor instead of already being at the cap and not being able to do anything about it.<br>
* Gear choices become a bit more interesting than "wow see how much Stam and Agi O_O??".<br>
<br>
[Percentages pulled out of ass.]<br>
<br>
[Of course [start], [end] and everything in between should be "appropriate" for tackling the relevant content at that progression level.]<br>

</div>I'm assuming you mean for dps?  Theoretically, Beserker's/Bloodlust combo is better long-term dps, but in practice I've found a lot depends on your crit rate and general level of gear.<br>
<br>
I valued crit a lot more until I started to find myself at the level where I'm sitting at 70-80 energy and having to Shred again before Rip runs out. I also find myself using Hourglass a lot still simply because it's a proc effect rather than having to remember to "use" it.</div>

</div>Aye, that's a sureshot replacement for Brooch of Deftness (which I have used religiously since it was released).<br>
<br>
It only has 3.50% avoidance reduction (1.75% dodge/parry each) vs the Brooch's combined of 3.89% (1.39% from hit and 1.25% dodge/parry each), but with a substantial Stamina upgrade, and the added bonus of Defense (which the Brooch was sorely lacking)!</div>

<br>
Also worth mentioning that i scratch the 2k DPS with all 2.4 items available.<br>

I'll post details as soon as i'm sure i made no major mistake.<br>

Edit: Ok, turned out i underestimated t6, it's still worth using 4 pieces, t4 seems out of the equation though.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Astrylian, what's a quick way of plugging in new items to rawr (short of manually editing the ItemCache.xml file)? If manual editing is the only way, can you make an updated ItemCache.xml file including all this new stuff available (I assume you've done this already, at least partway, to produce the list you posted earlier today)? Just to make sure you catch them all:<br>
<a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?items&amp;filter=ub=11;cr=82;crs=1;crv=0" target="_blank">Items - World of Warcraft</a><br>
<br>
All new 2.4 items usable by Druids, unfortunately it includes cloth and caster jewellery which you'll need to filter out somehow.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>Honestly, Rawr doesn't handle items that aren't in the armory very well. It'll query the armory and have to time out for each one you add in the item editor. I added em manually in code, and you could just add them in xml. But yeah, I added all those items in my review post... I'm missing a few newer items though, I'll add those when I have a chance today, then post my itemcache.xml.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Based on the preliminary analysis of the 2.4 items, i'd say that it's not even worth using 4t6 anymore (let alone 2t4/4t6). The new nonset rogue items are just so insane that they outweight the set bonus completely.<br>
<br>
Also worth mentioning that i scratch the 2k DPS with all 2.4 items available.<br>
<br>
I'll post details as soon as i'm sure i made no major mistake.<br>
<br>
Edit: Ok, turned out i underestimated t6, it's still worth using 4 pieces, t4 seems out of the equation though.<br>
<br>
This is what i came up with as the new ultimate list (counting only the new token items, i don't know what else there might be in sunwell).<br>
<br>
Duplicitous Guise<br>
Telonicus's Pendant of Mayhem<br>
Thunderheart Pauldrons<br>
Thalassian Wildercloak<br>
Bladed Chaos Tunic<br>
Thunderheart Wristguards<br>
Shadowed Gauntlets of Paroxysm<br>
Thunderheart Waistguard<br>
Leggings of the Immortal Night<br>
Thunderheart Treads<br>
Stanchion of Primal Instinct<br>
Signet of Primal Wrath<br>
Band of the Eternal Champion<br>
Madness of the Betrayer<br>
Dragonspine Trophy<br>
<br>
6075 AP / 53.64 % Crit<br>
<br>
~ 1968 DPS not counting drums, bloodlust and the more exoting raid buffs (factored in adamantite weightstones though).</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div><br>
That is a bit of a surprising result.  I expected we would still have to keep 2t4.  Was this using Tossk's?  Also a bit surprised that the Shadowed Gauntlets were good enough to switch from Thunderheart Gloves to Shoulders.</div>

</div>Actually using toskk it will still be better to use t4 shoulders and gloves, but only by like 50 points. At that level i would probably pick the best pieces if they were available since not all fights are teron gorefiend.</div>

</div>There is nothing wrong with crit rating. We're mostly hit capped at this point, and stacking agility on top of the high agility we're already gaining will only makes deminishing returns kick in in terms of item points investment.</div>

I valued crit a lot more until I started to find myself at the level where I'm sitting at 70-80 energy and having to Shred again before Rip runs out. I also find myself using Hourglass a lot still simply because it's a proc effect rather than having to remember to "use" it.</div>

</div>I also did some calculations and got similar solutions. It seems like t4 shoulders + gloves, the three new T6 pieces and the Head + rogue sunwell loot is at least as good as using 4t6 with t6 shoulders + rogue sunwell loot. Don't forget that the haste on the new items buffs 2t4 as well.<br>
<br>
And tbh I think it makes more sense to save the BKP and get a nice trinket (no luck with DST or the talisman from Leo..). Both variantes are more or less equal to each other and I'm not interested in spending DKP just for a style upgrade.</div>

</div>That's a case of which theorycraft and dumbed-down modelling cannot factor enough variables. From more than several months of end game expirience and dpsing there's nothing more important than keeping a 100% perfect cycle, not having hit cap gives you such variations in your energy, cycle and GCD that you lose more DPS than you would ever get by focusing on other stats. The two steps to predictable stable high dps is to get as close to 100% hit as you can and keeping your crit as high as you can whilst doing it.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
I'm not sure I will believe this until I've had a chance to try it myself, but I've come here to ask if there is any confirmation, and if so, to see what it's theorycrafted to be worth.  The idea of having such a useful debuff in PvP is very appealing, for example, but my guess is that the 150 frost damage would have to proc an awful lot before it was better than 35 agi in a pure PvE damage race.  <br>
<br>
Thanks for any information, even if it's only to confirm it doesn't really work.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I can't see it stacking with Thunderclap. That sort of attack speed reduction is hugely powerful in PvE and Blizzard specifically prevented the Thunderfury debuff and Hurricane debuffs from stacking in this way.

		<div id="post_message_636446"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->But hit rating doesn't account for dodges, so unless you're both expertise capped AND hit capped, there will always be some measure of unpredictability in your cycle as far as attacks not landing. Someone mentioned it earlier in the thread, but I think its worth repeating that Agi and hit rating (up to 142) are both good stats and you should try to get as much of both as you can without sacraficing too much of one for the other. Nothing will play out exactly like a simulation, and its true you can do top DPS without being hit capped - its just a choice of how much you want to leave to the RNG. <br>
<br>
I don't personally care about being capped if I have to sacrafice too much to achieve it, but there are times when a miss can really bite you in the ass. I'm at 124 hit rating in my current DPS gear and I can recall a fight not too long ago where I missed 5 attacks the entire fight: 3 white hits and 2 rips. Ouch. Since then, I've alternated between using warp burgers and spicy talbuk as my dps food of choice - but can't say I've seen an appreciable difference either way. With similar group comps from week to week on the same bosses, my dps (irregardless of being hit capped or having 20 extra agi) has stayed in pretty much the same ballpark.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Did you even bother reading this thread before you posted in it? Perhaps the first post few posts, or hell, any of the other posts where people are talking about keeping 2t4 into t6 content?<br>
<br>
edit: and this isn't directed strictly at you, but if I see too many more stupid questions (aka those that can be answered CLEARLY within the first 3 posts of this thread) I'm going to start personally asking for more harsh infractions on people. Dukes (and many others) have put alot of effort into taking all but probably 95% of the useful information found in this thread and put it in the first few posts. There are other class threads that aren't this easy to read for someone clicking on it for the first time and if people continue to clutter this thread with stupid posts I'm just going to lose it.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_636509"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->My napkin math got deleted, but consider this: <br>
<br>
2% hit (approximately what's missing) is a miss once in every 50 hits.  Let's say you compensate for this every other time, but you mess up every other time-- so it affects one out of every 100 cycles.  That's once every 1200 seconds, or 20 minutes.  You're changing one shred into a mangle by doing this, and possibly losing a CP.   Is it fair to say that the long-term difference here is 1-2 DPS? Or in other words, turning a shred and 1 CP into a mangle is around 1200-2400 damage?<br>
<br>
If you take a similar scenario with turning the shred after a mangle from buffed to unbuffed, and estimating average shred damage around 3000, you lose 690 damage every 20 minutes for about a .5 DPS loss.<br>
<br>
While these might subjectively be bothersome, adding these factors into the base value of hit rating still doesn't make hit rating more valuable than agility, point-for-point.  And the better you play, the less of a factor they become.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_636563"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->As far as gemming 15 sta vs. 5 agi/7 sta, you really have to consider what your role is.  If you're mostly MTing, and on trash, tanking one of the last mobs to be killed, 15 sta might be the way to go.  If you're MTing a fight or two, but mostly OTing and tanking first assist targets on trash, 5 agi/7 sta seems like the way to go.  Looking at the little information we have about the tanking requirements in the Sunwell, it doesn't seem like our role is going to change enormously, so I'd say keep wrestling the Amethysts away from your healers.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>First of all - theoretically - hit is not a real good dps stat for us (as discussed before). While you want as little misses as possible for maximum reliability and stability, you will never achieve it completely, unless you have tons of expertise (due to dodge). So in most cases it's not worth going over the cap as you effectively waste a few points hitrating - instead you want to get as close as possible (so you don't waste points and still have almost no misses).<br>
<br>
Not to mention that in the numerous cases you don't fight lvl73 mobs (trash, adds) you only need 6 % hit anyway.<br>
<br>
In this particular case it's 104 hit on the gear alone. You need to add the Helm Enchant (16 Hitrating) and 2x 5 Agi / 5 Hitrating Gems and you're at 130 hitrating ( 8.7 % Hit). So it's not quite as bad as you think.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Nobody as far as I am aware has yet managed to compile all of it to test, but it seems that 100% physical avoidance is already possible.<br>
<br>
I will update a list with 2.4 gear here.<br>
<br>
<i>Assumptions:</i><ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li>Player base dodge chance = 0</li>
<li>Boss base miss chance = 5%</li>
<li>Druid base agility = 75</li>
<li>For a druid, 14.7059 agi yields 1% dodge (12.9796 agi on gear -&gt; 14.7059 agi with Survival of the Fittest talent + Blessing of Kings buff)</li>
<li>For any player, 18.9231 dodge rating yields 1% dodge</li>
<li>Player has 350 defense skill before gear</li>
<li>For any player, 2.36 defense rating yields 1 defense skill</li>
<li>Defense skill is floored</li>
<li>For any player, 1 defense skill yields 0.04% chance to be missed + 0.04% chance to dodge</li>
<li>Boss weapon skill = 365, effectively negating the first 15 player defense skill beyond the level-70 standard 350.  (<i>Need to clarify this.  The 5% base miss chance for a boss seems to be against a player with equal (i.e. 365) defense skill, which would be perfectly clear, but sometimes sources seem to incorporate these assumptions inconsistently.</i>)</li>
</ol><br>
Based on the above values, one can rank gear choices for a slot with these ratings:<ul><li>1 agi = 0.0770</li>
<li>1 defense rating = 0.0339</li>
<li>1 dodge rating = 0.0528</li>

		<div id="post_message_636687"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Is there a way to attach files to posts?  I hand jammed most of the new items into rawr  (I'll share if somebody can find an easy way to do it), and found these results:<br>
<br>
2pcT4/4pcT6, 4pcT6, and just straight taking the best item in each slot are very close theoretically.  One changed buff, or a mistimed mangle could change the order around.  <br>
<br>
Personally I prefer 2pc/4pc.  It lets me get the most mileage out of the gear I already have and allows rogues to pick up their upgrades first.  If you are going to do 2pc/4pc, the best is t4 hat/shoulder, and t6 glove/belt/boot/bracer.  Gemming/enchanting those 4 slots of T6 for DPS doesn't really interfere with using them for tanking, unless you really need def on the bracer.  Also, in this set the crafted chestpiece is theoretically equal to the drop - by passing on both chest and head to rogues, you may have a chance of getting those hot hot pants sooner.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Those gloves have been in the game since TBC.   AFAIK, no new loot has been added to Kara since TBC's debut (and no changes since item levels went up).  They simply haven't been mentioned because they're not notable. <br>
 <br>
The relevant content in the first post is using DPS calculators to figure these things out instead of just asking.  With the exception of some preference for hit rating/expertise, the calculators (Toskk's or Rawr, Voldin's sheet, etc) encompass anything we could tell you, will give you a much faster response, and provide a bevy of answers to similar questions in the future, albeit with more work on your end. <br>
 <br>
Or, you even could have armory'd some druids here and seen that if they're wearing DPS gear, it's either 2t4 or 4t6, and take it as evidence that it's worth it. <br>
 <br>
Or, you could've just looked at what the bonus did and realized that it returns you energy, which is pretty obviously worth a lot of stat points.  <br>
 <br>
The point is, by asking the question, you've shown that you're not willing or not able to acquire any of the above knowledge on your own.  Responding to your post clogs the forum, further increasing the "noise" of the forum and keeping it from having any meaningful discussion.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				Everbloom idol is 88 damage per shred. Assuming you shred once per 4 seconds (general average based on using some energy for mangles/rips, losing some through dodges/etc), that gives 25-30 DPS factoring in crits and armour reduction and everything else.<br>
Idol of the Raven Goddess gives +0.4% crit to everyone in the party. Assuming an average person in your party does 1500 DPS with a direct 1%crit-&gt;1% damage ratio (which isn't far off), it's a gain of ~6DPS per member of your group, or 24 DPS + your own gain (more likely to be 4-5 or so). Remember that it's ~6DPS per physical DPS member of your group! Obviously if you're in a group with 2 hunters, a shadowpriest and a resto shaman, it's value decreases massively and you'd be better off using everbloom.

	</tbody></table>
</div>1500 DPS per person might be a bit conservative based on today's parses, but keeping with the original numbers, 20 crit rating gives ~0.9% crit. Again, keeping with the 1%crit-&gt;1% damage ratio as per the OP, each person gains 13.5 dps for a total party gain of (13.5 * 4) + ~11 dps for yourself = 65 dps, vs the 25-30 dps estimated for Everbloom.<br>

				I have a feeling that the Raven Goddess will become better as gear goes up, as it scales pretty well (including in to WotLK if they don't actually itemise idols properly).
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>Whilst it's true that Raven Goddess will become better as the people you group with do more dps, it won't scale into WotLK due to it having crit rating instead of a static crit% chance. Ratings are sure scale down from 70 to 80 (e.g. 14 crit rating for 1% crit at 60 vs 22.1 crit rating for 1% crit at 70).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
Shred spamming with a mangle bot, I calc this at 2172 dps on Gorefiend. Note: the necklace is JC only with a JC only gem. <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32591"><span><span class="purplename">[Choker of Serrated Blades]</span></span></a> is 2nd best imo, but would leave the set further short on hit.<br>
<br>
At this point I have to agree that end-game 2t4 is no longer the best. However, sets cannot be thrown together by just taking the best in slot. Until you reach that end-game level, T4 helm and shoulders are probably still best to keep. Again, this could remain true even over 4t6 until you have enough gear.<br>
<br>
I'll be posting a beta version of my spreadsheet as soon as new items have stabilized. I've made quite a few changes, some of which are still in development though. I've kind of lost track, so hopefully I can remember them for notes.<br>
<br>
Edit: Updated necklace with 10 hit gem instead of 12. This leaves the set 1 short instead of 1 over, possibly needing a little more tweaking.</div>

</div>You really shouldn't be worried about the leveling part - you'll be just as fast with furry hunter's (considering you get more stamina, armor and int for a minimal dps tradeoff). Remember that unlike in raiding, you need to tank, dps and heal at the same time while (solo) leveling.</div>

I don't think we will kill Kil'jaeden in any time too soon). <br>
<br>
So I would like to hear, how far 2T4/4T6 would be behind a set with Vision or Guise, DPS-wise?<br>
<br>
T4 - hat, shoulder<br>
T6 - gloves, belt, boots, bracers<br>
<br>
Do you think, it would be comparable to a Vision/Guise-Set, so that I can tell my stomach to stop hurting when thinking about the fact I won't probably ever reach those two items?</div>

</div>2 problems with this math:<ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li>Auchenai Monks Tunic + 3 10 Agility Gems is 54 Agi, not 60</li>
<li>You don't meet the meta gem requirements for RED with all 10 agility gems</li>

Because of this we need to use Carnal Instinct for chest, losing 24 dodge rating and gaining 14*1.1*1.03 agility (15.9).  We also lose the 12*1.1*1.03 agility (13.6) from RED.<br>

We therefore end up with 1147.1 agi -&gt;78.00% dodge<br>
174 dodge rating = 9.20% dodge<br>
<br>
This net change of 1.12% dodge does not drop us below 100%, but does imply that there may be some other choices to be made regarding the metagem.<br>
<br>
Additionally, for testing purposes, do we know a high level mob (perferably 70+) that uses purely dodgable attacks?</div>

</div>As you said, Ratingbuster can do that for ratings (hit, crit, haste, etc.). As for Armor Penetration it's not possible, as the amount of damageincrease you see through it depends on the target's armor, which varies.</div>

</div>Thank you for catching this.  I was copying from my earlier list where I'd incorporated the enchantment.  Since the Auchenai Monk's Tunic is in fact not the top item and is unlikely to be readily available anyway, I am cutting it from the list.<br>

</div>Ah, yes.  I'd forgotten about this problem again.  Since we are only gearing for maximum avoidance here, activating the meta gem for dps isn't essential, and it turns out that, even with an agility bonus on the chest, it costs more agility to satisfy the gem requirements than would be gained by using that helm instead of the previous non-meta-gemmed helm choice.  In the end, since we can achieve &gt;100% avoidance with room to spare, a druid in this luxurious position might well choose the helm with activated meta-gem anyway.</div>

</div>This question belongs in the PvP Forums, i will give you a brief overview anyway.<br>
<br>
To kill a druid your rogue should directly go cs-&gt;ks, this forces the druid to blow his trinket for the ks or he will take heavy damage. In my experience, i get away from rogues using expose.<br>
<br>
Regarding your opener - go for pounce, it does more (reliable) damage and the stun is really good. It will only last 2s cause of the cs but it's good nonetheless. It does not reduce your ks duration, afaik.<br>
<br>
You could also wait for your rogue to do his ks and pounce immediatly if the druid blows his trinket - you lose 4s of damage but you keep him in place.</div>

</div>I'm not so sure about that. The following napkin math shows that a mangled shred still does more damage/energy compared to the new ravage. Math in part one is credit of Toskk. It's close, but a mangled shred still comes out ahead. This shows that shred scales better in terms of damage per energy.<br>
<br>
Mangle<br>
1.2 * 1.6 * AP / 14<br>
0.1371 * AP<br>
40 energy<br>
0.0034275 scaling/energy<br>
<br>
<br>
Shred<br>
1.3 * 2.25 * AP / 14<br>
0.2089 * AP<br>
42 energy<br>
0.00497381 scaling/energy<br>
<br>
<br>
Ravage<br>
3.85 * AP / 14<br>
0.275 * AP<br>
60 energy<br>
0.00458333 scaling/energy<br>
<br>
<br>
Rip<br>
1.3 * 0.24 * AP<br>
0.312 * AP<br>
30 energy<br>
0.0104 scaling/energy<br>
<br>
And even at a theoretical 0 AP, Shred still does more damage/energy than a mangled shred.<br>
<br>
Shred<br>
((1.3 * 2.25 * 54.8)+405)/42=13.459<br>
<br>
Ravage<br>
((3.85 * 54.8)+514)/60=12.083</div>

<br>
If you discount his loot (the Guise), then 2T4/4T6  (4: hat/shoulders 6: belt/bracer/boot/hand) takes a slight (10dps) lead over 4T6 (hat/belt/boot/bracer).<br>
<br>
Simply going best in slot would be noticeably behind (40dps).<br>
<br>
This is based on hand jamming stats into rawr - I haven't gotten around to doing trinkets/jewelry.  I don't think that would change the relative value of the gearsets.</div>

On another note, have anyone on PTR been able to spot any difference in threat on lacerate with the change to the scaling?</div>

</div>Yes, planning an extreme end-game set does nothing in telling you how to get there. Chances are almost certain I will never see that set. It shows you max potential and a goal to aim for. As I said, just taking best in slot is a bad idea. It is also just as bad idea to only plan on getting the absolute best and nothing in between.<br>
<br>
I usually keep a number of iterations of gear to plan for. Those include both the best possible as well as realistic possibilities (at each tier level). Best possible would be all the rogue loot, dps trinkets, and such as well as placement in the melee group. However, my guild runs melee heavy. We have up to 3 rogues, 3 dps warriors, 1 enh shaman, 4 hunters, and 1 other feral all highly active. This puts me very far down the line for upgrades as ferals are considered primarily for tanking. So, realistically I will possibly never receive the rogue loot and never get in to the melee group. As second MT, I also need to plan my gear for tanking which often means weighing stam over agi (especially since I generally can't get spinels).<br>
<br>
As any individual progresses, they must evaluate options for their personal and guild requirements. You need to make both short-term and long-term goals.<br>

</div>That's the reason I like the 2T4/4T6 setup.  You should already have the T4 (if you are in a position to do more then day dream about T7).  The b/b/b T6 pieces drop 3 at a time, so you shouldn't have much of a problem with those - cat's speed isn't bad for tanking, you can enchant stats on bracers unless you are really hard up for anti-crit, and purple epic gems or the rare red ones aren't that big a gap from the epic reds.  T6 gloves are pretty much the same if you use them for tank or dps.  If you are a LW you can craft the new chest - according to rawr for that particular gear set its pretty much equal to the rogue one.  The legs may be a problem, especially since the #2 legs are the bear version of the rogue ones, and #3 is Thunderheart, which you may want enchanted for bear form.</div>

		<div id="post_message_639053">I spent a few minutes and tried to pick out the gear I intend to wear for tanking on an "average" raid.<br>
<br>
Edit: Updated armor, forgot armor from agility; new value is much better although it would be nice to drop the Magtheridon ring.<br>
<br>
I came up with: <br>
=&gt; 35302 armor, 24764 hp, 71.54% dodge, 2.12% miss<br>
=&gt; 0.63% hit, -3.74365482% parry, -3.74365482% dodge<br>
<br>
A few remarks:<br>
-- Total armor seems a bit low on the new pieces (see Belt of Natural Power vs T6, new chest has less than T6, oddly the new legs have more armor than T6)<br>
-- I didn't factor in any procs (ie. ignored both trinkets and the idol)<br>
-- I didn't choose max avoidance or max stam, just used new Sunwell loot as the assumed "upgrade"<br>
-- I wanted to get uncritable without consumable assistance<br>
-- I didn't use a guardian elixir, since I mostly just use Elixir of Agility on an "average" raid<br>

This patch brings some interesting new alternatives to Feral Tank itemization, socket- and enchanting.<br>

15 Defense Rating on Chest is a very good alternative to 6 to all stats and 15 Resilience if one would only need 2/3rds to remain crit immune. 15def/resilience is a good relief for those struggling. <br>
<br>
18 stamina + 20 resilience is an even greater relief for replacing any defense enchants or gems. However the avoidance lost is huge. I am currently working on some numbers and seeing how my current gear would look like with it - whether I would gain or lose overall survival/mitigation regarding the replacements. <br>
<br>
I am interested in hearing what thoughts you others may have about these new alternatives. <br>

If you discount his loot (the Guise), then 2T4/4T6  (4: hat/shoulders 6: belt/bracer/boot/hand) takes a slight (10dps) lead over 4T6 (hat/belt/boot/bracer).<br>
<br>
Simply going best in slot would be noticeably behind (40dps).<br>
<br>
This is based on hand jamming stats into rawr - I haven't gotten around to doing trinkets/jewelry.  I don't think that would change the relative value of the gearsets.</div>

</div>Head: 18 stamina 20 resil = 32 item points, 16 defense r. 17 dodge r. = 33 item points. 20 resil gives you ~ 0.5% crit reduction, 16 defense ~ 0.27%. <br>

Real value of these enchants depends on your gear setup, so it is not possible to say that they are better / worse than current ones.

I'm assuming I didn't completely fail at math since Mijae also has this trinket in the proposed end-game DPS set using the same assumption.  The only data on the proc rate I've found is one unsupported post on Wowhead asserting that it has a 45-sec internal cooldown.</div>

</div>Are your values for defense "druid" values or traditional values? (ie. only 1/2 value considering we don't get benefit from parry and block)<br>

For a primary tanking helm, [18 sta, 20 resil] seems pretty nice.</div>

		<div id="post_message_639524">Traditional values. I guess when comparing defense and resilience it does not matter, we get only half benefit from both, but it might change the comparison of chest enchants.<br>
<br>
Nevertheless, setting up tanking gear at high-end level is basically shuffling with the "mandatory" crit reduction stats so that you waste as little important stats as possible depending on the gear you currently have. Item values of these enchants are not that important imo.</div>

</div>I think the addition of the resilience head enchant allows some great flexibility for your bear gear and would make the <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33672"><span><span class="purplename">[Vengeful Gladiator's Dragonhide Helm]</span></span></a> a very viable option for a high-end tanking set as it would allow 49 resilience to be obtained via one item. <br>
<br>
It would then only take a <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32501"><span><span class="purplename">[Shadowmoon Insignia]</span></span></a>, <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33593"><span><span class="purplename">[Slikk's Cloak of Placation]</span></span></a>,<a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=29279"><span><span class="purplename">[Violet Signet of the Great Protector]</span></span></a>, and <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28792"><span><span class="purplename">[A'dal's Signet of Defense]</span></span></a> (4 more slots) to reach the uncrittable mark. <br>
<br>
This would give maximum flexibility for the other 7 T6 items or any non-set sunwell drops (and also make items like the <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33579"><span><span class="purplename">[Vestments of Hibernation]</span></span></a> more viable for lower tier tanks) , while at the same time allowing you to avoid making compromises on enchants for potential dual purpose items (such as enchanting the chest with resilience or bracers with defense).</div>

</div>Great, that just leaves the proc rate as a relative unknown.  I've seen a couple of references to a 10% proc rate.  Using that  and figuring the probability of 1 - probability of getting no proc [ 1 - (.90)^x where x is the number of hits] gives:<br>
<br>
10 hits = 65.13%<br>
15 hits = 79.41% - One minute mark for kitties (assuming no haste).<br>
20 hits = 87.84%<br>
25 hits = 92.82%<br>
30 hits = 95.76%<br>
45 hits = 99.12%<br>
<br>
So it seems like 1ppm might be a little generous and it's closer to .75 ppm? (I'm not sure what the cut off would be).  Even so it still comes out just below <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33831"><span><span class="purplename">[Berserker's Call]</span></span></a>.  Looks like I'll be farming MGT as soon as 2.4 comes out for Bear and Cat.<br>
<br>
p.s. The empirical data in that thread averaged out at 1 proc every 53.7 seconds but since it's such a small sample set I didn't include it as part of the calculations.</div>

</div>First, I'm pretty certain procs of this type can proc off of yellow attacks as well.  Let's just say you have around 4 attacks in those 15 seconds (approximately one cycle, plus a little bit).  So you're up to around 19 attacks at the break-even point.<br>
<br>
Also, while you show there is a significant chance to proc late (i.e. almost 5% by the 30th swing, about 10 seconds late), you've got to realize from your numbers that it's got around 7/10 of a chance of proccing at least 5 seconds earlier than 1 minute.  Modeling it as 1 PPM might actually be a little slow, and the empirical data is probably closer to reality.</div>

</div>Yeah this is where my math was failing me.  While I know how to calculate the chance of proccing it for a given amount of time after the cooldown expires I'm not at all sure how to use that data to average out how long it will take to proc.  Looking at it again I would tend to agree with you that (purely based on gut instinct) 1ppm or slightly more is a more accurate model.</div>

</div>Think of it this way. We know that Tsunami Talisman and Hourglass of the Unraveller have a 45sec cooldown and... I think it's a 15% chance to proc <i>on crits</i>. With a 45% crit rate, that's a 6.75% chance to proc on each hit. This one is also a 45sec cooldown, and is a 10% chance to proc on each hit, almost 50% more likely to proc on each hit. And we normally describe Tsunami/Hourglass as 1ppm, so this is at least 1ppm, if not faster.</div>

</div>Actually, the best way of finding the chance of X occurring in Y independent trials, you compute the chance that it wouldn't happen and then swap that.<br>
<br>
So, in this case we look at:<br>
<br>
<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px">
	<div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom:0px"><img src="assets/code_html.gif" border="0"></div>
	<pre class="alt2" dir="ltr" style="
		margin: 0px;
		padding: 3px;
		border: 1px inset;
		width: 694px;
		height: 178px;
		text-align: left;
		overflow: auto">%Chance of proccing in N hits = 1 - (chance to not proc)^N

Cat swings in N seconds = N * (1+%Haste) + INSTANTS

INSTANTS = 15s of typical cycle (150--ok, 154--energy nets us 4, in this case; however, I don't
                    think rip counts as it does no instant damage. Correct me if I'm wrong)

Caveats:
-Everything hits
-Cycle has a 1 mangle, 2 shreds, 1 rip; uses 152 energy (dont care about CP, just energy usage)</pre>
</div>So, rough numbers, ignoring haste, give us 18 hits in 15 seconds; that's 18 chances for the proc to occur. That yields the following:<br>
<br>
<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px">
	<div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom:0px"><img src="assets/code_html.gif" border="0"></div>
	<pre class="alt2" dir="ltr" style="
		margin: 0px;
		padding: 3px;
		border: 1px inset;
		width: 694px;
		height: 34px;
		text-align: left;
		overflow: auto">Likelihood of Proccing in N hits = 1 - (1-procrate)^18</pre>
</div>If the procrate is somewhere in the ballpark of 10%, we get an 85% (ok, 84.99) chance to proc every minute.<br>
<br>
If anyone on the PTR wants to load up procwatch (or whatever proc-tracker addon is popular these days) and beat on some of the invincible mobs in blasted lands, we can get the exact %chance, within a small error term, but I'd be willing to guess that 10% is, in fact, pretty close.</div>

</div>I'm amazed that it simplifies to this... I would have thought the "average" time to proc would be imbalanced either by the greater likelihood that you'll proc the first time, or by long miss streaks (i wouldn't have thought they balance each other equally), but I guess I'm wrong.

Total Bleed Damage: 155 + 5 % AP per Application, modified by Naturalist and Mangle.<br>

This effectively means your TPS increases by 0.825 % of your AP with a mangled 5-stack lacerate that's refreshed once every 12s (i bit more or less depending on your crit rate and the target's armor). So that's a 21 TPS increase with 2500 AP, not really noticable.<br>

		<div id="post_message_642081"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->So, I have good news and bad news regarding Rawr b11. <br>
<br>
<br>
First, the bad news: <br>
<br>
See all those disabled controls in the options screen in cat mode, that I said would be functional in b11? Sorry, not going to be ready for b11.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Now that that's out of the way, lets talk about the good news, what IS going to be in b11: <br>
<br>
All stats editable in the Item Editor <br>
Models updatable independently of Rawr itself <br>
Fixed a couple dual-monitor bugs <br>
Buffs now have tooltips in the charts <br>
Added Weapon Properties (min/max damage, speed) <br>
Metagem requirement detection (optional) <br>
Updated almost everything for 2.4. Don't try to refresh data on any 2.4 items though, it'll just throw an error because the Armory doesn't have them yet. <br>
Added calculations for more cat idols <br>
You can now swap models on the fly <br>
Revamped the item slot/type system to support more items in the ranged slot, offhand items, projectiles, projectile bags, different armor classes, and weapon/armor proficiencies. <br>
Rawr'll remember what model you last used and start up in that mode. <br>
There's a list of recently opened documents in the File menu now. <br>
Added support for all races, though Cat and Bear only provide race stats for the two races that can be Druids. <br>
Added filtering of items to only ones with stats relevant to the current model. <br>
ExposeWeakness is now available for cats, and there's a slider on the options tab to control how much AP it provides <br>
Bloodlust, Drums of Battle, and Drums of War are now available to cats, and there are 3 sliders on the options tab to control how much uptime each has. <br>
Models can now define their own custom charts. Cat now provides Combat Table (White), Combat Table (Yellow), and Relative Stat Values. Bear provides Combat Table, and Relative Stat Values <br>
<br>
You may notice that several of those items sound like they're useless to ferals, or even to all druids... and you'd be correct. No druid will need to use different races, or equip a projectile, no feral will need an offhand, etc. But these features are going in, to prepare for more models. I'd love to say that Rawr.Moonkin and Rawr.Tree are in the works, but they're not, not directly anyway. Rawr.Hunter is though, because someone came to me asking to build a Hunter model, which sounds good to me. If anyone knows C#, and is intimately aware of the theorycraft of Moonkin or Trees, please let me know, I'd love for you to make a Moonkin or Tree model, and I'll do everything I can to make sure Rawr supports everything you need for it. I've been doing a whole lot to make Rawr not just a tool for ferals, but rather a platform for all theorycrafters. For example, I've made only the bare minimum required defined in the model, and everything in the model base class is fully documented. <br>
<br>
I hope to have b11 released within a few days, and I hope to be able to report a wide variety of Models in development soon.  <br>
<br>
P.S.: Don't be too concerned by this, Feral is still my passion, my primary focus. I'm just trying to open Rawr up so that other people who have different passions can build something just as special for their peers. I don't intend to be actively developing any of the other models myself.<br>

A feature request: can you add an option so that it only lists a piece of armor once with optimal gems? E.g. I don't really need to know that Belt of One-Hundred Deaths is better than my current belt with [10 Agi, 4 Agi/5 Str] OR with [10 Agi, 5 Agi/7 Sta] OR with [8 Agi, 4 Agi/6 Sta]. Add to this another option asking what's the highest level of gems you have access to (rare, epic) and it should clutter up the item list much less.<br>

One thing I'd like is a way to see all the differences compared to last saved version for Basic/Complex Stats. This would  make it much easier to see exactly what would change compared to my current gear if I upgrade/resocket/switch around some gear (a typical use case for me at least).<br>

</div>Maybe I'm missing something here but I don't see the problem. The gear lists only shows things added through the item editor so you have full control over it. To prevent irrelevant or default items from showing up, simply use the item editor to delete/resocket (you can always add them back later). The item editor is still a bit clunky but workable.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_642511"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I figure a couple people here may get a chuckle out of this...<br>
<br>
I spent a few hours tonight attempting to fix two bugs in the Rawr.Cat model. Or at least, I thought they were bugs. Turns out that in both cases, I had just made Rawr <i>too</i> accurate.<br>
<br>
First, I spent a while trying to figure out why it was rating Belt of Natural Power with 2x 12sta gems higher on dps than Belt of Natural Power with 2x 10agi gems. I searched and searched, and just couldn't figure out why it would think that 24sta &gt; 20agi for dps... Then I realized that I had "Enforce Metagem Requirements" turned on, and that I needed a blue gem to activate my metagem. It really was saying that 24sta+12agi+3%dmg on crits &gt; 20agi, which is quite true.<br>
<br>
Then I spent a while trying to figure out a bug in my new Relative Stat Values chart. This chart includes several fake items which give +1 to a variety of stats, so that you can see how much 1agi is worth compared to 1str, or 1hit, or 1haste, etc. I would occasionally see it giving skyhigh values for agi, just over double what I thought it should have been. Then I'd change on piece of gear, and it'd go back to the normal value. This wasn't just slight changes as you'd expect from scaling of the different stats, this was huge changes. In one case, I was swapping between 2 identical chestpieces, except one had an 8agi gem, and the other had a 5agi/5hit gem. You'd expect 1agi to be worth very slightly more when the 8agi gem was equipped, but instead, 1agi was valued twice as highly with the 5agi/5hit gem equipped than with the 8agi. I struggled for over an hour to figure out why, when it hit me. 1agi really was worth twice as much in that case, because at that exact agi amount, adding 1agi, combined with the rounding that WoW does, from SotF and BoK, rounded up to 2 agi. (For example, BoK gives 10% more agi... You've got 9agi now, BoK gives you 9.9, but WoW still rounds that down for a total of 9. Add 1 agi to give yourself 10, BoK gives you 11, and that rounds to 11. Started with 9, added 1 agi, and got 11.) I still haven't figured out exactly how I want to make that more/less accurate (or rather, more informative), but at least for b11, it'll probably really be doing the value of 10agi, divided by 10. That makes is bounce up and down a bit depending on how many rounding breaks are within that set of 10, and it also scales it up slightly as agi increases, but it's at least closer.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>This is exactly what I do for my spreadsheet. I actually have it an adjustable value. There's really no good way to avoid the interaction with BoK. You'ld also have to figure in SotF and even buffs like Mol'dar's Moxie. There's also problems with defense and expertise rounding different ways than base stats.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

As for the staff it does seem odd that its another DPS staff. That said it would take a major rework of it to change it to a tanking one. I'd suggest focusing comments and changing the Pillar from Str-&gt;Agi which would make it a strict upgrade to Wildfury for tanking.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_642656"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Hello, I would need an advice on macro mechanics. To get to the point, today I edited my old macro for shred and added equip idol bit.<br>
<br>
<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px">
	<div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom:0px"><img src="assets/code_html.gif" border="0"></div>
	<pre class="alt2" dir="ltr" style="
		margin: 0px;
		padding: 3px;
		border: 1px inset;
		width: 694px;
		height: 50px;
		text-align: left;
		overflow: auto">/cast [nostealth] Shred; [stealth] Ravage
/equip [noequipped:Everbloom Idol] Everbloom Idol</pre>
</div>Also I made a macro for mangle and Idol of terror:<br>
<br>
<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px">
	<div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom:0px"><img src="assets/code_html.gif" border="0"></div>
	<pre class="alt2" dir="ltr" style="
		margin: 0px;
		padding: 3px;
		border: 1px inset;
		width: 694px;
		height: 50px;
		text-align: left;
		overflow: auto">/cast Mangle (Cat)(Rank 3)
/equip [noequipped:Idol of Terror] Idol of Terror</pre>
</div>This is the reason why i changed macros. Idol of Terror's proc is keept even when the idol is unequiped, so when doing cat dps, if it proces gives 65 agility over 10 seconds and in cat (Agility = 1.133 (1.25) AP, 1% crit per ~25 agility (1% crit per ~22 agility)) so it seemed like a nice boost to dps when in cat. <br>
<br>
I came up with the idea (I know it's pretty obvious but until lately my main concern was tanking)  while browsing items yesterday for dkp values and I came across a highlighted comment on this page:<a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30051#comments" target="_blank">Idol of the Crescent Goddess - Items - World of Warcraft</a>... anyway I'll copy/paste the important bit:<br>
<br>
<b>All relics (Idols, Totems and Librams) can be macro'ed to be swapped AFTER the cast. The swapping of relics in fight incurs a global cooldown. Adding the swap after the cast 'feeds' the global cooldown you would get from swapping into the global cooldown you will get from the spell cast. The key factor though is that due to the way the game parses you can still get the full benefit from the idol even if technically speaking it wasn't really equipped when the cast was made.<br>
</b><br>
So if I understand correctly... idol change does trigger gcd but if in macro it comes second (after cast part) it kinda goes into gcd of the spell. Tested it today and I do get the proc on first mangle in my mangle macro. Still don't quite get this part so if there's someone with more knowledge on this I'd appreciate any reply. Bottom line is: Do I loose any dps when doing this and if so is the dps gained from idol's proc higher?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_642745"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Actually, I may have a better way to accurately find the value per agi...<br>
<br>
It's brute force, though. First, get the overall rating for the current character. Then add 0.01 agi, until the overall rating changes. Then go back to 0, and start subtracting 0.01, until the overall rating changes. Then based on those two points at which the overall rating changes, such as -0.45agi and +0.52agi, find their difference (0.97agi), find the difference of the overall rating at +0.52 and at 0 (165, for example), and divide 165/0.97. The value of 1agi currently would be 170, and couldn't ever land on a value where it gets doubled.<br>
<br>
Really brute force and inelegant, though. <br>
<br>
EDIT: Nevermind. The period between each final agi varies, so that's still inaccurate. Sigh.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
DOWNLOAD: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080503205739/http://druid.wikispaces.com/space/showimage/Rawr+b11.zip" target="_blank">http://druid.wikispaces.com/space/sh...e/Rawr+b11.zip</a></b><br>
<br>
Recent Version History<br>
---------------<br>
Beta 11:<br>
* You can now change between Bear and Cat mode, and any other models, on the fly, using the new Model menu.<br>
* All stats are now editable in the Item Editor, not just bear stats.<br>
* Rawr has been updated for the 2.4 PTR, as of 2/15. Most of the new items have been added, and the idols have been changed to their new stats. Note that you shouldn't try to Refresh Item Data on a new item, as it'll just fail to find the item and timeout.<br>
* Added accurate calculations for all the decent cat idols.<br>
* There's now a checkbox on the Options tab to enable Metagem requirement detection. If you run into a situation where one item is ranked higher than another, and you think it should be the other way around, see if the first one helps you meet the metagem requirements, and the second one doesn't. Turn that option off if you like handling metagem requirements yourself, and it'll always count the metagem.<br>
* Buffs now have tooltips in the charts.<br>
* The most recently used model will be selected at startup. No more dialog asking what model you want to startup in.<br>
* There's now a list of recently opened files in the File menu, so you can open your different gear sets and characters faster.<br>
* The model system has been changed so that each model is its own DLL, meaning that models can be updated/added/removed seperately of Rawr itself.<br>
* Fixed a few bugs on dual-monitor setups.<br>
* Items can now have weapon properties (min/max damage, speed)<br>
* In order to prepare Rawr for a wider variety of models, the item type/slot system has been revamped. You'll now notice that there are 2 more buttons on the main form, for Projectile and Projectile Bag, though nothing will fit in them for ferals. Same with the offhand.<br>
* Added support for all races, though Rawr.Cat and Rawr.Bear only have stats for NE/Tauren, of course. This is in preparation for Rawr being used by other classes.<br>
* Items with no stats relevant to the current model will be hidden from charts/dropdowns<br>
* There are now several new buffs for cats: ExposeWeakness (which has a slider on the Options tab to control its AP value), and Bloodlust, Drums of Battle, and Drums of War (which have sliders on the Options tab to control their uptime %).<br>
* Models can now define their own custom charts, which are now used by Cat to include Combat Table (White), Combat Table (Yellow) and Relative Stat Values, and by Bear to include Combat Table and Relative Stat Values. Note that due to rounding abormalities when working with small values of certain stats that get multiplies, the two Relative Stat Values charts aren't as informative as I'd like, yet; take their values with a large grain of salt, consider them alpha quality for now.<br>
* You can resize the main form to give you more chart space, and more space for the tab control with calculation display, buffs, options, enchants.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>They are included, but it sounds like you're using an older EnchantCache.xml (and probably BuffCache.xml as well). Delete them Rawr will recreate them with its internal data which includes these and new items. Same for itemCache.xml if you want the new 2.4 items.<br>
<br>
<br>
Also, if anyone sees ratings that don't 'look right', check if you've got Enforce Metagem Requirements turned on. That can cause a bit of confusion if you don't realize that a blue gem is listed as giving you more dps than a red gem because you need the blue gem to make your metagem work. I've updated the posted .zip to change that to off by default, to avoid that confusion.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Looks good. Just a small bug I noticed. It's showing me <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30881" target="_blank">[Blade of Infamy]</a> and <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32369" target="_blank">[Blade of Savagery]</a> as Off Hand options, even though we can't use swords. Also, more of a nuisance, but it took me a bit to realize "Idols" had been replaced with "Ranged" in the slot drop down menu, maybe it can detect class and rename the menu item appropriately.

</div>Hmm... I saw that socket bonus issue at one point, but thought we fixed it. I'll take a look.<br>
<br>
Regarding the rip idol... That is indeed the correct math, unless you have 4T6, in which case it's got an extra  * 1.15, which would make it almost the same damage as what you have for Everbloom there. For me, Everbloom comes out significantly higher. If you e-mail me your character (cnervig@hotmail.com), I'll take a close look at it.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Hmm, factoring in the +15% dmg, I still end up with 269.997 dmg, slightly below everbloom still. You know what though? I totally forgot to factor in misses and the crit rate is actually 49.55...% which could cause the discrepency between the two, as they are ranked quite similarly. Email will be sent shortly.<br>
On a similar note, anyone think the rip idol will be nerfed? For a blue instance drop, it catches up to the everbloom one significantly at higher levels of gear.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">- There were times when clicking the +20 agi food would cause the kitty points for items to go down. My thought was that this could only raise the kitty points for an item since it would add crit, scaling other stats on the item. Am I missing something here?

Here's why, lets look at the Agility.<br>
With no food buff, you currently have 609agi. Switch to Insidious Bands, and you've got 627agi, a gain of 18agi.<br>
With the food buff, you have 630agi. Switch to Insidious Bands, and you've got 647agi, a gain of 17agi.<br>

You've got more agi in the 2nd case, so each point of agi is worth slightly more, but you're also getting 1 less agi, so there's a slight decrease in value, due to the rounding.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I figure a couple people here may get a chuckle out of this...<br>
<br>
I spent a few hours tonight attempting to fix two bugs in the Rawr.Cat model. Or at least, I thought they were bugs. Turns out that in both cases, I had just made Rawr <i>too</i> accurate.<br>
<br>
Then I spent a while trying to figure out a bug in my new Relative Stat Values chart. This chart includes several fake items which give +1 to a variety of stats, so that you can see how much 1agi is worth compared to 1str, or 1hit, or 1haste, etc.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>1. Hmm this might be an obvious thing you just cant do due some programming design, but shouldnt it be +1 stat added to the already buffed stats and not before buffing? (gonna assume thats not possible in your model for some reason)<br>
<br>
2. How about those fake items, are they static? If not how about replacing the fake +1Agi with:<br>
1,03*BoK AP and 1,03*BoK*22,1/25 crit rating<br>
<br>
If they are static how about having 2 bars, one with a fake item with BoK, and one without.<br>
<br>
3. And is it even worth calculating the +1 str, shouldnt it be 2,06*BoK AP?<br>
<br>
Edit: was a bit to earlie when i had those bright ideas it seems ;-). For point 1 adding +1 unmodified of buffs would ofc not give the correct relation between stuff affected and stuff unaffected by buffs. I now realise both 1 and 2 comes back to that a char for instance cant have 645.3 Agi in your program it will have (as in Wow) 645. 3 should be true though.<br>
<br>
I guess toskk uses another method for determening the relative values since his str to AP ration pretty much is 2,06*BoK at all times (i might be on deep water, but i itnhk i read you use his modell as base for your cat_model)<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Yep, I got thrown because I had loaded my equipment from the armory and I knew that I wouldn't possibly be running around without my metagem activated. Turns out I swapped out my bracers two weeks ago when I got the PvP ones and didn't realize I had lost my metagem requirements. I've been running around for weeks without my metagem on! D'oh!!! Went back to my <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33540" target="_blank">[Master Assassin Wristwraps]</a> until I can switch around some sockets. Since we more regularly have a boomkin raiding with us now (improved faerie fire) I need to drop some +hit anyway, so major resocketing is in order.<br>

</div>Right, those shoulders are an interesting situation. I named them "Shoulderpads of Vehemence Alt" in Rawr, because I added the sockets to them.

Shoulders: 152.22<br>
Legs: 320.17<br>
<br>
Helm+Shoulders: 352.35<br>
2T4: 389.54<br>
<br>
The two different runs I did were just to check scaling. The differences are pretty negligible between two sets at vastly different gear levels so the following conclusions are probably pretty accurate regardless of your gear (as long as its near the level to obtain these things). <br>
<br>
At absolute top end it seems Helm + Shoulders should be T4. Boots, Belt, Bracers and Gloves should be T6. Chest and Legs should be the sunwell pieces. <br>
<br>
Some of the sunwell gear (notably the helm) may not be easily available but this doesn't change the conclusions (since the helm is one of the pieces you should use T4 on). The only exception here is if you are a non-leatherworker. If you are non-leatherworker you cannot make the <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=34369" target="_blank">[Carapace of Sun and Shadow]</a> so if you cannot obtain the Sunwell Chest (which probably drops of Kil'Jaeden) your next best piece is the S3(!) chest. As such it would be much more reasonable to use the T4 chest and T4 shoulders as your 2T4 pieces for the bonus and use a Cursed Vision, Tier 2 Eng helm or sunwell helm in the head slot.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>While it's no answer to your question, i'd get another trinket for dps. You should have at least 33 % crit in your dps gear, meaning in average this trinket grants you less than one percent crit.

AP just gives you AP, but agility not only gives you a good amount of crit but also some nice AP (one point agility should give you 1*1.1*1.03 AP). Agility, and such AP from agility also profits from blessing of kings and enh-shaman buff, while AP just profist from enh-shaman buff (forgot the name of it, sorry).<br>
<br>
But the question, wether to prefer agility or AP (ie crit oder AP) is not answered straight, because for each values of crit and ap there is a ratio of those which is optimal. So whether you should collect more points of crit oder ap depends on how many points of each value you already have.<br>
<br>
To calculate this values, use one of the tools named in the first post. On most of them you can also see, where your current items are rated, and which items are rated better.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Yellow attacks are on a 2 roll system so there is no crit cap for that. Tossk has done some research that suggests white hits are also on a 2 roll system but even without that, the crit cap would be near 75% since you can push dodges and misses off the table completely so the only things you cannot remove are glancing blows which account for max 25% of your hits.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_644976"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Say what?<br>
<br>
Isn't the crit cap only an issue for dual wielders with really low hit rating vs 73 boss mobs? (25% glancing + 28% miss + 5.6% dodge = 58.6%, so crit cap is 41.4%)<br>
<br>
For Druids with no hit rating, the crit cap would be: 25% glancing + 9% miss + 5.6% dodge = 39.6%, so crit cap is 60.4%<br>
<br>
Or am I missing something really obvious here?<br>
<br>
edit: Forgot about dodge!<br>
<br>
And as Valerian mentioned, any appreciable amount of hit rating and/or expertise will raise the crit cap accordingly, as well as specials which are on a 2 roll system and form a much higher percentage of our damage as compared to dual wielders.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Although FR is nice on Anetheron, you dont need to cap resistance as that will limit your ranged dps classes in how fast they can kill it due to reduced threat.<br>
<br>
I generally wear the Blastguard belt, quest neck and epic crafted boots, then make sure I'm in a Pali group for fr aura. That combo gives you around 200 fr for minimal loss of threat. Also these slots are generally not the ones giving you crit immunity so it's pretty easy in that respect to make up your gear set.<br>
<br>
Illidan Flames are different matter of course <br>

</div>I think you need around 88-89 expertise rating to get capped on it. For cat form this may be nearly doable with top end gear since the new trinket is 44 expertise rating. You get another 20 from the T6 boots and 18 or 21 from a neck piece. Now some numbers had it at around 100 expertise needed to be capped so you could add Vashj's belt in for another 25 expertise. Now it may not be worth it to do this considering the tradeoffs (Vashj's belt is significantly worse than the new T6 belt). As there is a nice expertise ring for tanking (high armor, sta and expertise). Haste CAN be good for tanking, but its certainly not a fantastic tanking stat. Expertise here would almost certainly be superior for both DPS and tanking. However, as was discussed in the 2.4 patch thread, it appears a lot of the T6 badge level gear is sup-optimally itemized to make it less appealing than the actual BT/Hyjal loot. In this regard it makes sense they added a slightly sub-par stat to the gear though one that is still useful in both forms.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_645650"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->The cap is with relation to dodges, from behind (as they pertain to rogues). The parry cap is significantly higher.<br>
<br>
The procs on all of them necklaces, from initial testing (yes, I'm exalted with SSO on PTR - don't ask  ) seems to be roughly 15%, although I need more time to do a proper sample size. It's 10secs, with a 45sec cooldown. It's still pretty good considering it's rep quartermaster gear (look at the other factions!) but obviously is going to be outclassed by higher level raid gear, as is should be.<br>
<br>
p.s. If anyone has a decent way to parse a combat log for proc rate calculations, I'm all ears. Right now I've been doing it manually, and it's a complete pain. Procwatch etc are understandably choking on PTR atm.<br>
<br>
Edit: Changed rep reward to quartermaster gear for clarity and to differenciate from rep rewards like Karazhan/Hyjal rings.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I think one of the errors I am seeing is i have choker of endless nightmares equipped which leaves me within 4 or 5 of hit cap.

</div>Indeed.  I'm not saying it is so much an error as it is a possible explanation for why people would be seeing odd results in the gear ranking.  I think to the extent there is a system in rawr that ranks gear for you, it should probably enable you to discount things like set bonuses and hit caps.  Just a friendly suggestion, but a prime reason why I don't use rawr for DPS.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_646134"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->To be honest, I don't think it's ever a good idea to ignore things like bonuses or caps. Items should never be looked at individually, but as part of a set. How can going over hit cap ever increase your set value? The only way this calculation would be possible is to value one hit rating when under the hit cap and assume that value is static as you raise it. I am strongly against using any form of equivalence points though. They only tell you the value of the next point of a stat. Applying those points to an item and adding up the results does not accurately reflect the value of an item. The only way to truly find the value of a particular item is to update all your stats using the current item and find the new total value. If you only use equivalence points, you'll never be able to accurately identify trends like stacking a particular stat.<br>
<br>
People need to learn that individual slot rankings cannot show you absolute, always, best-in-slot items. Any ranking system can only show you value in relation to some baseline. In some of the earlier rankings like Emmerald's, a static average base set was used. For Toskk's, you enter values of your choice. Spreadsheets like mine and Voldin's (and I assume Rawr) use the rest of your current set with the item slot empty as the baseline.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">The Lacerate change isn't going to do anything noticable to your threat generation (unless the inert threat scales too). It will give you a substantial dps boost though. However, as far as i see it, we don't have a threat generation problem anyway.</div>

</div>Having high threat in DPS gear is pointless for tanking comparison --- Woot! 2500 TPS at 14k HP, 20k armor, and 2.6% chance to be crit!<br>
<br>
Our threat sucks in full armor/stamina MT gear compared to both Paladins and Warriors.  We need proper and competitive threat scaling when we wear real tanking gear.<br>
<br>
Raid buffed, threat wise, in a primary tank role/group, we only gain AP from BoK, BoM, and possibly Hunter's mark, we also gain crit from a possible agility/food potion, and increased damage from possible Blood Craze.  <br>
<br>
So we may gain 3-5% crit and 700 attack power, which is basically an gain of 10% more crit and 25% more ap.  Unlike a Protection warrior, which probably gains 50%+ more crit and doubles their attack power.  Not to mention, Warriors gain the benefits of weapon enchants and Windfury.<br>
<br>
Beyond buffs, the rest of our TPS gains come purely from raid-wide armor reductions.  Otherwise, we provide almost the same threat as we do solo, unbuffed.  <br>
<br>
Lacerate is virtually static threat.  We have no expertise on our gear and limited hit.   <br>
<br>
How can you say we don't have threat generation problems?<br>
<br>
Without 2/5 and 4/5 T6, our end-game TPS issues would probably already have been addressed.<br>
<br>
Generally speaking, giving us Lacerate was dumb.  Swipe was so much better (and still is) anyway.  A better ability would of been some kind of active avoidance/mitigation on a short cooldown or a reactive ability like Revenge. <br>
<br>
Destroying Swipe scaling was even dumber.  Swipe used to be a key advantage of having a Druid tank and now with more than 3x the AP we had at 60 in Bear, we get easily out-aoe-tanked by undergeared Protection Paladins.  I don't even do anything in Hyjal, I'm afk basically 100% of the time because 1 paladin can tank virtually every single pull and provide much better threat on 20 mobs than I can on 3.<br>
<br>
Other than the possibility of gaining full physical avoidance with the new Sunwell gear and a bucket of spinels, we're basically just a crushable Warrior with poorly scaling threat, pathetic mitigation/avoidance scaling, and subpar oh-shit buttons.<br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong, we are the best "tank" for fights offtankable in DPS gear (with our free time spent in Cat form), but in the full-time tank role, we don't scale properly.<br>
<br>
Quick Fixes:<br>
-- We need a new tank weapon (missing from 2.4).<br>
-- We need Expertise (mostly addressed in 2.4).<br>
-- We need Lacerate scaling (somewhat/sorta addressed in 2.4).<br>
-- We need properly itemized gear outside of the core pieces of gear (somewhat addressed in 2.4)<br>
(t6 belt, t6 bracer, t6 boots, new ring -- still wearing kara ring, badge of tenacity, wildfury)<br>
<br>
Long-term Fixes:<br>
-- Fix Swipe.<br>
-- We need to get to armor cap with less gear so we have more options in other slots and/or the armor cap needs raised to 75% to 90%.<br>
-- The crushing blow mechanic needs rethought (I believe this will be fixed somewhat in next expansion -- Blizzard is making less and less bosses crush, and we still have the full avoidance possibility)<br>
<br>
Sorry, this probably looks like QQ, but to just assume we have a "threat generation problem" is wrong.  This was something we used to have, but severely lack in T6+ content.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I am not experienced in T6 content, my personal experience only extends to T5, it does seem strange that your threat generation seems so lacklustre when compared to your peers, (Not a personal dig just highlighting differences) where as in the mid T5 progression guild I am in Druids have far superior threat generation. (For example Void Reaver, who while easy is a good 'threat race', is very trivial when tanked by 2 Druids, compared to the 4 tanks we use to take, Note the previous Feral Druid wasn't very good).<br>
<br>
Having said that, I agree that we need a new Tank weapon, anyone trying to say the Hyjal staff is an adequete tanking staff is incorrect. Maybe so if weapon switching was not an option however.<br>
<br>
Expertise is lacking on Leather (Nonexistant?), I have the Broach of Deftness personally (Hate Dodge/Parry/Missing), but 5 Expertise doesn't cut the mustard.<br>
<br>
As for Swipe vs. Lacerate, I'm satisfied with both of them in the light of 2.4, not entirely happy but it could be worse.<br>
<br>
In regards to Crushing Blows, I do not believe that Tanking has enough...depth? Not sure if that is the right word, Right now as a Feral Tank <b>with a focus on Main Tanking</b> stats are Defence/Res to 2.6%, Armor - capped when MTing, Stamina - not terribly useful after a point reached around T4-T5, Agility(Dodge) - this is the 'last' stat that is effectively capped, (I know 102.4% avoidance)<br>
<br>
Hit Rating and Expertise are not a major concern, Haste is purely for increasing Damage, Crit comes with Agility. Threat comes with the upgrades (Tanking gear [read: Tier] comes itemised like DPS gear, once at the Armor cap Tanking gear quickly becomes very similar to DPS gear [Due to stacking Agility, possibly Stamina])<br>
<br>
The problem is twofold in my opinion:<br>
<br>
#1 The effective armor cap is reachable in Teir 4. By effective I mean that the far majority of the time Inspiration and the Shaman Armor buff (25%) will be active when Main Tanking (usually OTing to).<br>
<br>
FIX: Extend the armor cap through to 80-90%. The amount of armor needed would massive, however this means scaling is possible (realistically only 42-45K armor is possible buffed, correct me if I am wrong).<br>
<br>
Or replace 4T4 bonus. Add another bonus.<br>
<br>
#2 The second problem is that Druids are just not as adaptive as Warriors. We are in essense a one trick horse. Once you have enough Stamina, capped or nearly for Armor all there is left to stack is Dodge (normally through AGI) and increasing Threat generation.<br>
<br>
FIX: Add another mechanism for reducing incoming damage, for example giving Strength a bonus to mitigation of Spell Damage,or the ability for some form Block. [Poor example but it gives another stat value when tanking]<br>
<br>
<font color="Red">EDIT: Generally speaking, giving us Lacerate was dumb. Swipe was so much better (and still is) anyway. <b>A better ability would of been some kind of active avoidance/mitigation on a short cooldown or a reactive ability like Revenge.</b><br>
</font><br>
<font color="Red">Perhaps that is a better idea than mine, same effect however.</font><br>
<br>
This has sort of been thought up on the fly, and is based on my personal experience, however it would correct some of the issues I believe Blizzard have not thought out. (Personally I don't think they beleive the Armor Cap was reachable so easily)<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Yellow attacks are on a 2 roll system so there is no crit cap for that. Tossk has done some research that suggests white hits are also on a 2 roll system but even without that, the crit cap would be near 75% since you can push dodges and misses off the table completely so the only things you cannot remove are glancing blows which account for max 25% of your hits.</div>

</div>Hi Valerian,<br>
<br>
Although my tests are far from complete, at this point I don't see any justification for a two-roll white attack system. I *believe* that what I'm seeing is instead a flat crit reduction against a raid boss (very much like the flat hit chance reduction). I've currently averaged this at 4.20%, although it could perhaps be as high as 5% (or as low as 4%). For any interested, my own tests can be found here:<br>

</div>Hmm hadn't checked that in a while. That also makes more sense since it would be odd for non-dual wielders to have a 2 roll white hit system whereas others didn't. <br>
<br>
Any idea where this crit reduction would be coming from? Mere weaponkill/defense differences should only amount to 0.6% crit reduction (assuming boss defense works the same as ours). I suppose an innate resilience could be there but ever since resilience effected DoTs I'd imagine that would have been noticed by affliction locks/Spriests.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>While that would be gorgious (~2.5K AP in tanking equip even with lower tier gear) I don't believe it is meant that way.<br>
It is simply a cat pvp buff (and maybe a slight pve one to make up for difficult-to-use healthstones/pots) and increases healing done to you while in cat form by that quantity of your current AP. I do hope this applies to ILotP, too, to improve the solo pvp performance a tad (according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080503205744/http://www.wowwiki.com/Formulas:Plus_damage_and_Plus_healing#Standard_spells" target="_blank">wowwiki</a>, instants have a coefficient of 42.86%, say 3K AP would equal 600 +heal on you, and thus 257,16 more healing. 3.5K -&gt; 300.02, 4K -&gt; 342,88)<br>
<br>
I do wonder whether this affects your own hots cast on yourself before entering cat, too, but afaik all the math is done when the spell is cast.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I'm curious as to how the second part will work with respect to HoTs. Will self casting a HoT then switching to Cat form provide the extra healing? I assume it'd work similar to the tree aura but I never tested how that works (say cast a HoT at someone and then switch them into a tree group). Anyone know at least how the tree example works?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Having high threat in DPS gear is pointless for tanking comparison --- Woot! 2500 TPS at 14k HP, 20k armor, and 2.6% chance to be crit!<br>
<br>
Our threat sucks in full armor/stamina MT gear compared to both Paladins and Warriors.  We need proper and competitive threat scaling when we wear real tanking gear.<br>
<br>
Raid buffed, threat wise, in a primary tank role/group, we only gain AP from BoK, BoM, and possibly Hunter's mark, we also gain crit from a possible agility/food potion, and increased damage from possible Blood Craze.  <br>
<br>
So we may gain 3-5% crit and 700 attack power, which is basically an gain of 10% more crit and 25% more ap.  Unlike a Protection warrior, which probably gains 50%+ more crit and doubles their attack power.  Not to mention, Warriors gain the benefits of weapon enchants and Windfury.<br>
<br>
Beyond buffs, the rest of our TPS gains come purely from raid-wide armor reductions.  Otherwise, we provide almost the same threat as we do solo, unbuffed.  <br>
<br>
Lacerate is virtually static threat.  We have no expertise on our gear and limited hit.   <br>
<br>
How can you say we don't have threat generation problems?<br>
<br>
Without 2/5 and 4/5 T6, our end-game TPS issues would probably already have been addressed.<br>
<br>
Generally speaking, giving us Lacerate was dumb.  Swipe was so much better (and still is) anyway.  A better ability would of been some kind of active avoidance/mitigation on a short cooldown or a reactive ability like Revenge. <br>
<br>
Destroying Swipe scaling was even dumber.  Swipe used to be a key advantage of having a Druid tank and now with more than 3x the AP we had at 60 in Bear, we get easily out-aoe-tanked by undergeared Protection Paladins.  I don't even do anything in Hyjal, I'm afk basically 100% of the time because 1 paladin can tank virtually every single pull and provide much better threat on 20 mobs than I can on 3.<br>
<br>
Other than the possibility of gaining full physical avoidance with the new Sunwell gear and a bucket of spinels, we're basically just a crushable Warrior with poorly scaling threat, pathetic mitigation/avoidance scaling, and subpar oh-shit buttons.<br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong, we are the best "tank" for fights offtankable in DPS gear (with our free time spent in Cat form), but in the full-time tank role, we don't scale properly.<br>
<br>
Quick Fixes:<br>
-- We need a new tank weapon (missing from 2.4).<br>
-- We need Expertise (mostly addressed in 2.4).<br>
-- We need Lacerate scaling (somewhat/sorta addressed in 2.4).<br>
-- We need properly itemized gear outside of the core pieces of gear (somewhat addressed in 2.4)<br>
(t6 belt, t6 bracer, t6 boots, new ring -- still wearing kara ring, badge of tenacity, wildfury)<br>
<br>
Long-term Fixes:<br>
-- Fix Swipe.<br>
-- We need to get to armor cap with less gear so we have more options in other slots and/or the armor cap needs raised to 75% to 90%.<br>
-- The crushing blow mechanic needs rethought (I believe this will be fixed somewhat in next expansion -- Blizzard is making less and less bosses crush, and we still have the full avoidance possibility)<br>
<br>
Sorry, this probably looks like QQ, but to just assume we have a "threat generation problem" is wrong.  This was something we used to have, but severely lack in T6+ content.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>I'm honestly not sure where this is coming from.  On any given fight, I can put out at least as much tps as our T6 warrior, and on fights like Gurtogg when not the primary tank, druid tps tends to be much higher than warrior tps.<br>
<br>
I understand that warrior tps has gone up a ton in T6 compared to T5 (where we could completely dwarf their threat), but to say ours can't keep up seems silly to me, especially in light of the fact that warrior threat went up thanks to hit/expertise, stats we're starting to see on our tank gear as well in 2.4.<br>
<br>
I do agree on the armor issue though.  Personally I'd love to see a higher armor cap.  Having high armor is kind of our thing, and for most people, we stopped scaling there in T5, and probably were close to it even in T4 (with 4t4).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Hmm, while the vengeful set does have a nice amount of agility, the weapons, rings and cloaks have none and the previous sets have less agility so this would be a nerf in pvp gear to your +healing when healing others and using non-HoTs on yourself (assuming you go into cat form after). A better change would be to increase your +healing by 30/60% of your attack power (which would scale with 90% of melee buffs) or maybe 25/50% of your agility + 15/30% of your attack power.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">To be honest, I don't think it's ever a good idea to ignore things like bonuses or caps. Items should never be looked at individually, but as part of a set. How can going over hit cap ever increase your set value? The only way this calculation would be possible is to value one hit rating when under the hit cap and assume that value is static as you raise it. I am strongly against using any form of equivalence points though. They only tell you the value of the next point of a stat. Applying those points to an item and adding up the results does not accurately reflect the value of an item. The only way to truly find the value of a particular item is to update all your stats using the current item and find the new total value. If you only use equivalence points, you'll never be able to accurately identify trends like stacking a particular stat.<br>
<br>
People need to learn that individual slot rankings cannot show you absolute, always, best-in-slot items. Any ranking system can only show you value in relation to some baseline. In some of the earlier rankings like Emmerald's, a static average base set was used. For Toskk's, you enter values of your choice. Spreadsheets like mine and Voldin's (and I assume Rawr) use the rest of your current set with the item slot empty as the baseline.</div>

	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>If I am at 137 hit rating and I have a helm that has 25 hit rating currently and am evaluating a helm with 30 hit rating,  unless the program itself does the calculation (which I don't think rawr does), ignoring the hit cap allows me to compare those two helms together in an absolute manner.  Even if its not helm to helm, there are times I will want to compare two items together without regard to the hit cap.  If I am deciding whether or not I want to DKP something I want to see if its better in a pure sense than what I have currently, with the understanding that I may need to regem, or replace another piece.  If I am evaluating set bonus items, ignoring the set bonus is useful for determining which 4 out of 8 pieces I want to use to get my 4t6 bonus.  Using Toskk's calculator, comparing each of the hands, helm, legs, chest and shoulders to their best non set piece items without regard to the 4t6 set bonus let me know which non-set piece was the most minor upgrade.  Now I know which of the 5 to use with the 3 new pieces to get 4t6.<br>
<br>
There are any number of reasons I would want to make evaluations without regard to caps and bonuses.  I'm willing to guess that most people, in fact, have learned how to use these magically complicated gear comparison tools and spreadsheets.  They aren't that tough.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Bad example then.  Like most people I plan my gear out well in advance.  I actually noticed it when I was looking to see if your valuation of the new sunwell gear agreed with Toskk's (which I expected it to).  The issue came up when trying to determine which of my t6 items to use with the 3 new ones.  Not having the ignore hit cap function made that very difficult to do with rawr, whereas with Toskk's it is very easy.<br>

</div>Definitely true.  Rawr is infinitely better when it comes to customizability on gem sockets.  I very rarely go for socket bonuses (usually only when I need to activate my meta).

</div>Obviously it is using an equivalence model that assumes at the ignored level of cap, the next point of hit still has the same consistent value.  The only use for that is comparing the relative value of two items assuming you are capable and cognizant enough to adjust your gear appropriately when needed.  It is still a very useful mechanic for plotting out gear choices in advance.  This is less about modelling 100% accurately and more about real world determination of gear choices.  <br>
<br>
I'd venture to guess that most people that use Toskk's calculator have found it a useful tool at least once.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Is haste on tanking gear reasonable? For cat, haste is least wanted stat according to Toskks gear methodology. How useful is it for threat?

</div>The only stats I really care about is STAM and AGI, hence +6 Stats = 12 item points and +15 DEF/RES = 15 items points.  I think you'd be better served by enchanting the chest with def/res, and socketing stam/agi.<br>
<br>
Also for equal items points DEF &gt; RES+AGI for a combination for crit immunity/mitigation/avoidance.  If crit immunity is your chief concern, sure use RES as a stopgap, get settling on DEF is superior.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_647746"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Been playing around with Rawr to try different gear combos, and it's getting pretty hard to figure a good one out with 2.4.<br>
<br>
Some amazing rogue (kitty) gear coming out.  The non-set items look very solid, but at the same time 4T6 is strong, and 2T4 is probably still very strong as well.  Looking at Toskk 2T4 is valued around 400ap for my gear, I doubt the difference between T4 and these new items is big enough to bridge that gap, especially given the lack of shoulders that really stand out.<br>
<br>
Since I don't have the T4 helm (yeah I know &gt;&lt;), that limits the best options in T4 slots down to gloves/shoulders (my current combo).  <br>
<br>
Then there's 4T6, so the 3 new pieces probably (bracers are not as great, but the difference between those and non-set isn't as big as legs/chest/helm slots), along with helm, chest or legs.  I suppose it'll depend a lot on my options in items, because all of those 2.4 rogue items are far better than T6 for dps.  Looking at those 3 slots, I'm honestly not sure which is the bigger tradeof, they all look to be about the same (maybe a slight edge to legs due to 3 sockets that can all be agi).<br>
<br>
Edit: Playing around some more, if I were to use T6 legs instead of the non-set legs, I keep my hit almost capped (3 rating short), whereas with the helm or chest as T6 piece I'm 2% short.... Choices &gt;&lt;<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Been playing around with Rawr to try different gear combos, and it's getting pretty hard to figure a good one out with 2.4.<br>
<br>
Some amazing rogue (kitty) gear coming out.  The non-set items look very solid, but at the same time 4T6 is strong, and 2T4 is probably still very strong as well.  Looking at Toskk 2T4 is valued around 400ap for my gear, I doubt the difference between T4 and these new items is big enough to bridge that gap, especially given the lack of shoulders that really stand out.<br>
<br>
Since I don't have the T4 helm (yeah I know &gt;&lt;), that limits the best options in T4 slots down to gloves/shoulders (my current combo).  <br>
<br>
Then there's 4T6, so the 3 new pieces probably (bracers are not as great, but the difference between those and non-set isn't as big as legs/chest/helm slots), along with helm, chest or legs.  I suppose it'll depend a lot on my options in items, because all of those 2.4 rogue items are far better than T6 for dps.  Looking at those 3 slots, I'm honestly not sure which is the bigger tradeof, they all look to be about the same (maybe a slight edge to legs due to 3 sockets that can all be agi).<br>
<br>
Edit: Playing around some more, if I were to use T6 legs instead of the non-set legs, I keep my hit almost capped (3 rating short), whereas with the helm or chest as T6 piece I'm 2% short.... Choices &gt;&lt;</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>All the rogue sunwell gear is amazing for Feral DPS. The LW chest and gloves are also very very good. Also all the new tier pieces are best in slot for dps from the looks of it, at least when I ran the numbers through Toskk's calculator.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I'm honestly not sure where this is coming from.  On any given fight, I can put out at least as much tps as our T6 warrior, and on fights like Gurtogg when not the primary tank, druid tps tends to be much higher than warrior tps.<br>
<br>
I understand that warrior tps has gone up a ton in T6 compared to T5 (where we could completely dwarf their threat), but to say ours can't keep up seems silly to me, especially in light of the fact that warrior threat went up thanks to hit/expertise, stats we're starting to see on our tank gear as well in 2.4.<br>
<br>
I do agree on the armor issue though.  Personally I'd love to see a higher armor cap.  Having high armor is kind of our thing, and for most people, we stopped scaling there in T5, and probably were close to it even in T4 (with 4t4).</div>

</div>Well I did say this "looks like QQ", but I was mostly comparing our threat in MT-gear (ie. single target) applied to variety of situations.  A Protection Paladin and Warrior wear basically the same gear (maybe swapping shield block for avoidance or stam depending on the fight, but never drop below 490 defense or really give up much total mitigation) for all types of tanking situations.  Whereas, a Druid cannot multitarget tank in Hyjal, for instance, in stam gear -- and definitely not in avoidance gear.  If I want to have similar threat to a paladin on more than 1 mob, I need to be in mostly full DPS gear with 4/5 T6 and chaining 700+ swipe crits.<br>
<br>
-- Our rage starved threat is only better than a Warrior because we probably have 3x the crit chance.  However, windfury + lotp + improved soc + igoa buff warrior rage considerably.<br>
-- It's a little different for a Protection Paladin because of their threat mechanics and dependance on mana (and thus small mana pool and no mana returns while building threat without being hit.)<br>
<br>
The major problem is that increases in our tanking gear in no way improves our threat.  Stam and Armor provide no increases in threat (actually hurts rage generation since we get less from hits?) and Agility only increases our crit rate.<br>
<br>
As mentioned before, I think an active method of avoidance and a reactive ability would make great strides in improving feral tanking.  <br>
<br>
Reactive ability:<br>
-- Frenzy (30 rage, 10 sec cd): After being the victim of a critical strike or a crushing blow, you increase in size and your attack speed increases by 30% for 8 seconds.<br>
<br>
Active avoidance:  Enrage could be changed to our oh-shit button, and instead of reducing base armor, it could increase our dodge chance for its duration.<br>
-- Enrage (1 min cd): Generates 20 rage over 10 sec and increases your dodge rating by 300.<br>
<br>
Threat that benefits from our armor:<br>
-- Maul [Rank 8] (15 rage, next melee): Increases the druid's next attack by 176 damage.  Causes additional threat based on your dodge.<br>
[Revert back to a threat modifier and instead use (1 + 0.1 * Dodge) to compute the modifier.  This would translate into a 1.6x threat modifier for a T6 tank and 2x threat modifier for a full avoidance tank.  This would also scale Maul threat with AP once again.]<br>
<br>
And as everyone in this thread has mentioned many times: fix Frenzied Regeneration!<br>
-- Frenzied Regeneration (3 min cd): Converts up to 10 rage per second into health for 10 sec.  Each point of rage is converted into (0.0025 * Armor) health.<br>
[Gives an 36k armor feral tank 900 HPS for 10 sec with a full rage bar.  Has a much lesser impact for Restoration druids.]<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Yeah, I know. It usually depends what I am tanking, with pocket watch + ssc staff I have 44.81% dodge with only motw. When tanking Hyjal with a shaman in my group, trinkets, agi/hp elixirs, and fully raid buffed I've tanked Hyjal with 73%(I think) dodge, it's sweet seeing a whole combot log of dodges :P<br>
<br>
I have a question, I was told that the druid staff which is at the badge vendor can not be purchased until the first gate is unlocked, could some one briefly explain this? I thought that you would be able to buy the staff right as the patch hits if you have the badges?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Now, I am not 100% sure how to judge the goodness of a tanking Druid.  From what I know, via word of mouth, the T4 set bonuses make T4 FAR superior to T5.  I believe that the Pillar of Ferocity drop from Hyjal is better than the staff that he has now.  <br>

<br>
Chest:<br>
15 def </h1><br>
&gt; 0.5064 avoid, 0.2532 anticrit<br>
15 resil =&gt; 0.3807 anticrit<br>
6 stats [6 sta, 6 agi]<br>
<h1><a href="#top" class="nuwiki_top_link">[top]</a>&gt; 0.4622 avoid, 102 hp<br>
<br>
15 def seems the winner on average.<br>
15 def provides the most avoidance.<br>
If you're over 2.6 anticrit, 6 stats is slightly better.<br>
If you're really under 2.6 anticrit, 15 resil is better (might be the situation with "T7"/expertise gear and lack of +def on the new tanking ring and trinket.)<br>
<br>
Head:<br>
18 sta, 20 resil </h1><br>
&gt; 0.5076 anticrit, 306 hp<br>
16 def, 17 dodge =&gt; [0.5402 + 0.8984] 1.439 avoid, 0.2700 anticrit<br>
<br>
Gem:<br>
10 resil = 0.2538 anticrit<br>
10 def = 0.3376 avoid, 0.1688 anticrit<br>
10 agi = 0.7704 avoid<br>
10 dodge = 0.5285 avoid<br>
15 sta = 255 hp<br>
<br>
10 agi provides best avoidance.<br>
2x 10 def is debatably better than 10 agi + 10 resil, which basically means socketing for resilience sucks (enchant resil and socket agility/sta/def is a better strategy)<br>
<br>
It's more interesting, however, when used in combination:<br>
<br>
Head [18 sta, 20 resil] + Gem [10agi] + Chest [15 def] = 0.7608 anticrit, 306 hp, 1.2768 avoid <br>
Head [16 def, 17 dodge] + Gem[15sta] + Chest [15 resil] = 0.6507 anticrit, 255 hp, 1.439 avoid<br>
<br>
The new helm enchant and new chest enchant looks like the winners next patch (when your not going for 100% avoid) since you trade 0.1622 avoid for 0.1101 anticrit (and 51 hp).  Considering 10 agi vs 10 resil provides 3x the avoid per resil, the 1.5:1 trade above is deal.)  <br>
<br>
Although we're still talking small gains/losses, getting more anticrit per customizable option (enchant, socket) and keeping the same avoidance is always better since it gives us increasing flexibility elsewhere.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Yeah I saw that and while my initial reaction was frustration it was an universal change for all DPS sets. <br>
<br>
There are two scenarios for us:<br>
<br>
1) Since we are the only case where our gear is for both DPS and tanking, they will change it in the next PTR patch.<br>
2) Another option is with the turn in T6 for vindicator gear, they plan to rely on PvP gear for tanking and have T6 as pure DPS? I only think of this because I use the honor bracers and belt for tanking though I'm leaning on them doing option 1.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

That'd honestly be the last thing I'd be worrying about, possibly only slightly surpassed in "not important" by Enhancement shamans' viability-rise in Arena...<br>

Didn't attempt to get on the PTR, but either the armour rating needs to drop, or the stamina needs to go up. Would've filed a report for sure. (And on Pillar ... and on t6 resto... and on...)<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

If you're really under 2.6 anticrit, 15 resil is better (might be the situation with "T7"/expertise gear and lack of +def on the new tanking ring and trinket.)<br>

Although we're still talking small gains/losses, getting more anticrit per customizable option (enchant, socket) and keeping the same avoidance is always better since it gives us increasing flexibility elsewhere.</div>

</div>I will admit that if you just need a little anti crit and can't make it up with Defence, that resilience is the better option.  But in terms of pure itemization points Defence is better.<br>
<br>
Compare for instance 154 Defence VS 103 Resilience and 51 Agility.<br>
<br>
The Defence user gets 2.6 anticrit, 2.6 Dodge, 2.6 Miss.<br>
<br>
The Resilience user gets 2.6 Anticrit 3.5% dodge and 0% miss.  Losing out on 1.7% avoidance.<br>

I'm perfectly comfortable using Resilience as a stopgap measure, but in the end I always plan on getting back to Defence.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Don't get me wrong, a little bit of int is nice and all, but we do fine with the amount we already have right now. Compared to int, stamina is much more important since we'll probably use the first pair of bracers/belt/boots as tanking offpieces, rather than DPS offpieces (belt probably less of a deal due to lack of enchants)<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_648393"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->IMO, the new pieces are nice --- but if the intention is pure DPS, the extra armor and intellect ruin it completely. <br>
<br>
The budget would be much better spent if the stats were spread across additional stats.  They could easily tack on hit and ap too, since we benefit from all those stats.  STR, AGI, HIT, CRIT, AP, EXP, APEN -- thats 7 stats -- if all used, would be great use of the item budget.<br>
<br>
Honestly though, how do changes like this go through?  Blizzard seems so quick to change gear for PvP concerns but takes forever to address PvE itemization (ie. Pillar of Ferocity, ZA Staff, T4 Gloves, T4 gear in general, Heroic gear, Kara gear, ... the list goes on.)<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

The rogue versions in Sunwell are all T6 tokens too, so we can never acquire them. On the flip side, our tanking items are a T5 crafted belt, S3 wrist and T6 trash boots.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">As mentioned before, I think an active method of avoidance and a reactive ability would make great strides in improving feral tanking.  <br>
<br>
Reactive ability:<br>
-- Frenzy (30 rage, 10 sec cd): After being the victim of a critical strike or a crushing blow, you increase in size and your attack speed increases by 30% for 8 seconds.<br>
<br>
Active avoidance:  Enrage could be changed to our oh-shit button, and instead of reducing base armor, it could increase our dodge chance for its duration.<br>
-- Enrage (1 min cd): Generates 20 rage over 10 sec and increases your dodge rating by 300.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>The Enrage sounds a tad too OP, changing the rage-generator with a drawback (for us it's armor, for warriors it's HP loss) to a 1min CD dodge trinket that also generates rage? (Dodge trinkets usually mean lesser rage generated as we're not hit that often)<br>
<br>
Frenzy on the other hand sounds reasonable and "lore-wise" fitting(big bear, many ferocious animal mobs have Frenzy) but either change the CD to 20/30 sec or let it proc only on crushings, else people would whine about it in pvp.<br>
Also the "increases size" part could cause problems when tanking bosses with a knockback and/or against a wall, if you remember the Karazhan tome when tanking Prince or Nightbane, or Bloodlust at any boss. But hey, could be a reason for them to fix the range bug :P<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>It used to be 5% anti-crit but was reduced when they lightened the talent point cost of it. Presumably if they wanted it kept at 5% they woulda done something with the talent then rather than reduce it to 3%. I think it may have something to do with itemization since a lot of the gear with defense would be suboptimal for ferals in that case (since it only boosts, miss/dodge). Now, another solution is to make defense like agi and vary depending on which class has it. Would make defense rating a bit more valuable for ferals if it increased dodge/miss a bit more than it currently did and also provided more anti-crit.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Yesterday in my very first Rage Winterchill fight I did a whopping (wait for it) 890 DPS. Terrible.

Last time I tried it was on a Kael attempt; because neither IceHUD nor Pitbull's druid mana bars deplete accordingly when powershifting, I ran myself dry fairly quickly, which was a major problem when I was called on to battle res someone (I didn't have mana pots on my cat bar, so I had to dig in my bag for them, costing me a lot of time).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I suppose so. Here's a WWS (ignore the "try 1", we killed him on the first attempt but I guess it mis-parsed slightly):<br>
<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080503205759/http://wowwebstats.com/q3eyidibrllko?s=15626-15872" target="_blank">WWS Parse: Rage Winterchill try 1</a><br>
<br>
(geez, that says I did 810, though my own Violation said 880. Damned math.)<br>
<br>
Toskk's sheet says even with zero cycles I should have done around 900 with my stats (raid buffed roughly 3500 AP, 34% crit, 129 hit, 2t4). So if the WWS is more correct than my own Violation guess, then something else is horribly wrong. And I never had to run out for D&amp;D, either, so I had nearly 100% DPS time.<br>
<br>
I guess a small part of this is that I had to do one Rebirth, but a guildie suggested that the biggest problem right now is my low (?!) crit percent. Another problem might be that I was in the tank group at the time (so I had Battle Shout and not much else), but I wasn't about to get switched into Melee (which I think was two rogues, an enh shaman, a hunter, and a fury warrior). On the other hand, Toskk's sheet doesn't count that, or I didn't have it set to, anyway.<br>
<br>
I guess I just need to get better equipment and powershift more vOv<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

We're all human right? Everyone makes mistakes. Anyway I wouldn't be too hard on myself, that particular fight is really a bad one to try to judge yourself on. Sure you can improve your gear (badge or Skyguard trinket, better DPS weapon, etc), but you were stuck in a tank group, had to BR, running hybrid tank/dps gear, etc so just write that one off.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_649522"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Gear:<br>
- Romulo's is a pretty terrible trinket.<br>
- Wildfury is pretty terrible for DPS.<br>
- You have a resillience gem in your bracers, with no enchant? (12 def + 8 agi gem would be a lot better for both tanking and dps if you need the crit reduction).<br>
- 12 agility on boots is as good, if not better, than 12 stam on boots, and still does something for DPS.<br>
- 12 stamina gems are a waste too, at least use agi/stam split gems, along with the 5 def/4 dodge gem in the hat.<br>
- You could give up 3 points from Primal Tenacity/Brutal Impact in order to get natural shapeshifter. At least work out what your base mana is and how many shifts it can support without possibly running out of mana (should be 3-4 at least).<br>
<br>
That fight:<br>
- Group setup was terrible for you. No totems, no hunter buffs, not even battle shout because the warrior was using Commanding by the looks of it.<br>
- No powershifting (as mentioned before) will cut out a significant amount of DPS.<br>
- You did 800 DPS and still cowered twice - lack of Salvation or misclicks? <br>
- ~30% crit with 35% char sheet crit means either you were unlucky (highly possible given the sample size), or you weren't using a single buff to give you more crit (agi pot, BoK).<br>
- Did you have Curse of Recklessness up on the boss? (can't find it anywhere). Improved hunters mark? Did you have a lot of breaks in melee DPS (because of D&amp;D) as that can easily screw over the WWS dps (rip ticks count as you keeping in combat, along with 5 seconds after any DPS applied).<br>
<br>
<br>
Are you actually surprised your DPS was "terrible" at 900? I'd say it's pretty good considering the above list and your current state of gear.<br>
<br>

</div>I would assume that's to do with D&amp;D (fight specific) - run out as you get a mangle/rip off, by the time you get back in mangle is gone and it's more worth starting a new mangle/shred cycle than just shredding before a mangle.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_649539"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Another problem is you may not have all your DPS gear equipped (you didn't get procs from your Hourglass, which on a fight that long means you probably didn't have it equipped).  If you don't have ItemRack, Outfitter, or ClosetGnome, you may want to get one of them.  You might've had your PVP trinket equipped instead, though.<br>
 <br>
Since you said you didn't have to run out of D&amp;D, I'll trust you should have been able to run standard cycles.  Make sure you're using a standard DPS cycle (mangle, shred until at least 4 CP, wait for 70+ energy, rip, repeat). <br>
If you're not getting to 4 CP before your mangle wears off (could be possible with such low crit), you might want to save till 90+ energy, and powershifting will help here too (only shift when you wouldn't get your 4CP in time, and mana will be fine).  Another tactic I use when DPSing Mother in heavy SR gear is to mangle-&gt;rip-&gt;shreds when I get stuck at 3cp.   A single lost rip tick is better than un-mangled shred-&gt;rip-&gt;mangle, although you'll probably need to powershift in that cycle to hit 4cp for your next one.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Hmm, yes.<br>

I always did 154-103=51 as spare item points.<br>
<br>
But it is really (103^1.5 + X^1.5)^.6666 = (154^1.5)^.6666<br>
<br>
Solving for X yields 93.<br>

154 defence is greater than 103 resilience and 51 agilty, but not 93 agility.<br>

</div>Powershifting doesn't work if you're in the GCD. You can /cancelform while under the GCD, but shifting back in is a spellcast. So yes, you'll always clip 1.5s off your tick.

				<div style="font-style:italic">Which part?  The second one is right.<br>
<br>
<br>
Anyway, about powershifting, maybe I've got my macro wrong, but I'm never able to time it right in such that it doesn't clip the next energy tick.  This is my powershift macro:<br>
<br>
/cast [stance:1]  Bear Form; [stance:2] Cat Form<br>
<br>
I use it for breaking snares and roots as well.  The problem I'm running into is I believe powershifting is affected by the previous ability's GCD.  Is this correct, because from moderate latency(200ms), would you really only have about 600ms time to place the powershift correctly?</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>Yes, if you use that macro while still in gcd you'll end up in caster form. That means that powershifting in cat form requires you to wait 1s after your last special before hitting the powershift button (clipping your energy tick and decreasing maximum powershifting gain to 30 energy).<br>
<br>
Still, getting 20 energy per powershift is still worth it if you time it right.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Part could come from combinations of buffs as well. Most abilities and proc/use items are modelled as averages. However, if you have things like Bloodlust, Drums, and Beserker's Call all up at the same time the dynamics are improved and are probably not modelled that way. Getting OoC procs and powershifting (for more shreds) while these are active can increase it as well. This is why active abilities are generally more powerful than passive even if they average to the same.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_649847"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I have read the opening page but i thought i would try and get some input from fellow raiders as to which trinkets they prefer.   My guild has long past Gruul's and not that many of us even pug it so i have pretty much given up on the coveted<br>
DST.  Right now im using the Tsunami Talisman and the Crystalforged trinket.  Also, i only have 67 hit (know i need more but I rarely seem to miss) and 25 expertise.<br>
<br>
<b>1)So is Madness of the Betrayer a big enough upgrade in DPS to warrant replacing one of my current trinkets? </b> <br>
<br>
<b>2) Is Idol of the White stag worth spending DKP on when i already have Everbloom, Terro, and the Raven idols and where does it fall as far as DPS output to the others?</b><br>
<br>
<b>3) is there a point i should add more AP (or STR) instead of agi/crit? </b><br>
I could give an Amory link but its a radi night so who knows what gear i will be in.  I will say that in DPS gear im 4/5 T4 with 3307 AP and 39.42 crit UNBUFFED.  dont reckon thats very impressive to some end raiders but its what Iv got to work with.<br>
<br>
<b>4) Is Dukes STR and AGI forulas correct for cat form stats post 2.3 patch?</b>  STR=2.49 seems a lil high when i thought they said they were nerfing it in 2.3 whereas AGI was getting a boost.<br>
<br>
<b>5) Assuming i wanted to add more overall AP, is it better to focus on STR or pure AP when selecting gear and gems?</b><br>
Obviously i will still be trying to find the item with the most Agi but this question has been buggin me for awhile.  I know that we now get 10% bonus to toal AP but each point of AP seems to give less overall AP as stacking STR if that makes any sense.  However,  when i did my own test by swapping gems and enchants,  the total AP seem to remain the same.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Strength is 2 AP per point.<br>
Strength gets 1.1x modifier from BoK, and 1.03x modifier from SotF. AP gets a 1.1x modifier from HotW.<br>
<br>
1x2x1.1x1.03.1.1 = 2.4926.<br>
<br>
Pre 2.3 it was worth 2.7 AP per point (HotW = 1.2x strength instead of 1.1x AP).<br>
<br>
To answer 5, Strength will always be better than pure AP due to BoK and SotF.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>The formulas are fine last I checked, it's easy to verify this for yourself:<br>
<br>
1 Str * 1.03 (Survival of the Fittest) * 1.1 (Blessing of Kings) * 2 (AP/Str) * 1.1 (Heart of the Wild) = 2.4926 AP<br>
<br>
1 Agi * 1.03 (Survival of the Fittest) * 1.1 (Blessing of Kings) * 1 (AP/Agi) * 1.1 (Heart of the Wild) = 1.2463 AP<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Which part?  The second one is right.<br>
<br>
<br>
Anyway, about powershifting, maybe I've got my macro wrong, but I'm never able to time it right in such that it doesn't clip the next energy tick.  This is my powershift macro:<br>
<br>
/cast [stance:1]  Bear Form; [stance:2] Cat Form<br>
<br>
I use it for breaking snares and roots as well.  The problem I'm running into is I believe powershifting is affected by the previous ability's GCD.  Is this correct, because from moderate latency(200ms), would you really only have about 600ms time to place the powershift correctly?</div>

	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>While DPSing, I use the following macro to safely powershift:<br>
<br>
#showtooltip<br>
/run old=GetCVar("autoUnshift");SetCVar("autoUnshift", 1);UIErrorsFrame:UnregisterEvent("UI_ERROR_MESSAGE")<br>
/cast !Cat Form<br>
/run SetCVar("autoUnshift", old);UIErrorsFrame:RegisterEvent("UI_ERROR_MESSAGE")<br>

- Why should there be a haste cap ? Overall i would say armor penetration is probably better stacking due to increasing returns.<br>

		<div id="post_message_650514">Apologies for bringing Kara-Gruul level discussion among the end game. <br>
<br>
I'm noticing I'm not putting out great threat, watching Omen the last few times I've been in bear gear in kara, I think I've seen 450-500 tps, spiking up to 800 tps when I'm getting maul into the mix, but it's not as sustained as I assume it should be.  I hold aggro but I want to keep it as the difficulty and dps ramps up.<br>
<br>
Rotation is standard Mangle, Lacerate, Maul (&gt;50 rage), swipe if I can without breaking CC.  Mangle is 1 key, lacerate is 2 key, and maul the 3, so I often have a Maul queued and lacerate cycling while mangle cooldown runs.  FF and Roar as needed.<br>
<br>
Gear and stats:<br>
Bear (self buffed):<br>
14514 health, 28526 armor, 420 def, 27.49 dodge, 0 resil, 1519 AP, 34 Hit, 24.24 crit, 6 expertise<br>
Fast summary is full clefthoof (all 12 sta, 6 stats, clefthide, boar's speed), T4 helm/gloves, necklace of deep, VE exalted and shermanar rings, EW (35 agi), badge of tenacity, commander's badge, gilded thorium (12 agi), Manimal's, umberhowl, sun-gilded shoulders (last 3 very weak), Idol of terror.<br>
<br>
Aiming to update belt and wrists with combination of PvP and badge gear, shoulders to T4, chest with S3.  Change some gems to shifting nightseye because my dodge is terrible.  Very limited time to play.  Semi-related post in the pre-raid thread from a week ago went unanswered.<br>
<br>
Is it my gear limiting my threat or is it me?  I'm trying to get better.<br>
<br>
Have many questions but trying to keep it short.</div>

</div>Sounds like your rotation is fine - the gear I've left above is all pretty weak for threat (excessively so in many cases - necklace of the deep is fine as long as you're using agi or agi/stam gems). Most of them are purely non-threat items (clefthoof, trinkets, cloak, rings) so it's not entirely surprising your threat is bad. You'll gain a lot by getting the upgrades you listed, and replacing gems is a good idea as you gain a lot of crit along with the dodge.</div>

		<div id="post_message_650558">It is true that the gear you have is not good for threat, but 500tps seems a bit too low to me. Unfortunatelly i cant test it. Few questions:<br>
- could you link your talents? Maybe you miss some threat-related talents (feral instinct, naturalict, ooc, shredding attacks).<br>
- do you use lacerate or mangle on _every_ global cooldown?<br>
<br>
As for swipe, with you gear swipe gives less threat than lacerate on single target mobs (even on non-bleedable ones). Do not use it on bosses.</div>

		<div id="post_message_650564">Thanks dukes.  Perils of obsessively stacking stam and armor as I started  kara I guess, and I'm paranoid about maintaining uncrittable. My T4 legs would cost me 29 stamina if I put a nethercleft on.  Switching all 8 solid stars for shifting nightseyes would cost me another 48 stam.  Could lose 77 stam in those changes alone.  Necklace of deep is also solid stars.<br>
<br>
Guess that's the cost of moving from introductory stuff to the next phase.<br>
<br>
Is 4t4 for bear worth pursuing or keeping once I have it? (I know 2t4 is a holy thing for cats, I've read and excerpted this whole thread)<br>
<br>
The goal in tanking trinkets I always see listed as Badge, pocketwatch, or stam trinks like darkmoon or netherwing trinket.  Guess I need to seek out more dps capable tanking trinks.<br>
<br>
In cat in kara, since most mobs are bleed immune, is it effective to ferocious bite and then powershift?  When powershifting, is it horribly ineffective to just hit your shift twice instead of a dedicated macro?<br>
<br>

</div>I wouldn't say they don't like us tanking, our tiered sets are pretty damn nice and get progressively better with more stats, sockets, and hit.<br>
<br>
Tier 6 2pc is amazing in many ways and t6 4pc is pretty amazing for swipe threat (helps alot to break the threshold where swipe does more threat that lacerate)<br>
<br>
I find most undergeared druids on my server who ask me questions tend to have like 450 defense or something absurdly over 2.6% ---- Hovering closer to 2.6% allows for greater threat, and I seriously can't think of any time where I was doing less than 1000 tps (Gruul's).<br>
<br>
I having really gone too much over the new badge gear because I will be picking up the new t6 pieces/eventually the 6.5 stuff that is outright amazing, but the items available are definitely SSC/TK level and beyond if that helps at all.<br>
<br>
===<br>
As far as gear goes, it can be a little tricky. As long as you are doing progression I would focus your dkp/concern on tanking upgrades --- Maybe try to snatch some DPS loot after it has dropped a couple times (If you get the chance ninja a DST). After like 23~ Illidan kills helm finally dropped and I took it, it honestly depends on your impression on other people, if you don't deserve it or if people think you are bad then hey your guild will probably tell you to F' off. Form good relationships with your rogues(and enhance shaman), I mess with them all the time and even if they might be a little ticked at first it really isn't a big deal when everything is on complete farm and everyone is geared to the teeth already. Cry more and learn to bid .</div>

 <br>
Discussion is about DPS because the tanking part doesn't require much theorycraft at this point-- it's mostly just a rehash. Although recent topics about max-dodge sets do bring to mind the fact that we can tank. It's more than it's hard to design gear that's an upgrade but also doesn't make it easy to hit 100% dodge. <br>
 <br>
The badge gear is fine, it has the same number of tanking stats as our T6 gear. A few less sockets in some slots, but that should be expected. And since our T6 bonuses involve higher threat rather than higher survivability, the new badge gear rates pretty well. <br>
 <br>
As for bidding on DPS gear: It all depends on how much you would use the gear. My guild is prot-heavy, so our ferals spend a good amount of time DPSing. So, only a handful of items are limited to rogue priority. If our ferals were tanking half the bosses, the story would be different.<br>
 <br>
What you'll find, however, is that with only a few exceptions, you can come pretty close to rogue-quality gear without interfering with rogue loot. S3 chest/helm/bracers, badge boots/etc, T5 vortex belt (you should have plenty of vortexes to fill the ranks, or guilds might sell it on the AH), Hyjal rep ring, 2t4 or 4t6, perhaps some other choice pieces. Put together with suboptimal rogue gear, and you are really only starving for better gear in a few slots: neck, second ring, and trinkets. And you can make a pretty good argument as you advance in the game that you deserve the right to attempt to replace Kara-level items if you are expected to DPS.</div>

</div>Try dropping Demoralising Roar and Feral Faerie Fire from your rotation as well if you're purely concerned with TPS. Mangle/Lacerate will do far more for your threat than Roar or FFF.<br>
<br>
There's a couple of nice upgrades for you from Badges or Arena that'll help with your threat as well as provide you with a ton of stamina.<br>
<br>
<br>
As to DPS pieces - don't sweat it. If you were supposed to go by:<br>
"You only DPS half the time, you don't deserve gear over Rogues" how would that compare to "You only tank half the time, you don't deserve gear before the Warriors/Paladins" ? Right - you'd never get a damn thing.<br>
<br>
That's exactly what DKP is for. If you can spare the DKP despite focusing on your main task (which, regardless of what we might hope for) still would be (off) tanking, then you deserve the loot.<br>
<br>
Rogues might not like it if you take a Tsunami Talisman or Madness of the Betrayer... if you keep passing everything (first 3 DST, first 3 TT, first 3 MotB...) you'll still be DPSing with your Bloodlust Brooch and Crystalforged Trinket by the time you finish Sunwell.</div>

</div>2pT4 isn't too bad for threat production at your gear level, either, it should help you keep your rage up so you can throw more Mauls into the mix.  4pT4 is nice, but not required, however, those pieces have great stats, so are probably worth picking up regardless of the bonus.<br>
<br>
As you build your tank gear, you should also be thinking about a number of different sets, staggered from cat to bear.  As you make compromises on mitigation and stamina, your threat and ability to switch to a dps role midfight go up.  Since a lot of the roles in your near future are going to be tanking one mob, then being a cat for the rest of the fight, you should start looking for pieces with good threat stats that may not be ideal for either.  <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=29177"><span><span class="purplename">[A'dal's Command]</span></span></a> and <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=27740"><span><span class="bluename">[Band of Ursol]</span></span></a> are good examples of relatively easy to acquire pieces that fill that role.  Basically, even if you're not interested in kitty dps, pick up the items anyhow, they will be useful in building higher threat lower mitigation sets that you'll use situationally.</div>

Doesn't seem very off. Though I had 18% less crit on Shred than you for only 26DPS difference in the end. I powershift VERY aggressivley. Both are pretty much identical except for the awefull miss rate you got on Shred, your 18% crit advantage totally got negated by the 12% more misses. Just proves how important it is to get 100% hit.</div>

From some Rawr playing, and random spread-sheeting, it looks like around 3+ T5 comes close to the T4-4 bonus, and 4 pieces of T5 has enough base armour to bear the T4-4 armour bonus.  It seems to me, that T4-4 and T5 pants make a lovely combo. <br>

</div>Assuming you get Full T4, then start getting T5 in the typical order of Shoulders, Pants, Gloves, <b>most likely</b> (use Rawr to be sure, but this is how it'll play out for most bears) you should wear...<br>
<br>
1. Start with 5T4 <br>
2. Get T5 Shoulders. Wear 4T4 + T5 Shoulders<br>
3. Get T5 Pants. Wear 4T4 + T5 Pants<br>
4. Get T5 Gloves. Wear 2T4 + 3T5.<br>
<br>
It typically takes 3T5 to beat 4T4. Until you can get 3T5, use 4T4 + whatever the biggest upgrade piece of T5 you have is. Again, this isn't for everyone, but it's a good rule of thumb.</div>

</div>And T4-2/T5-3 will last for a long long time as a bear-OT? (And yes T4-2/S3-2/x for cat until T6)  Especially if you dps after. Ok. We're working on 5/6 (1+1)/4 currently. So was wondering what set gear I should pass on, what gear to grab,  in order to aid the raid.  I guess I should also look at other class' lust for T5. <br>

The tooltip for Nurturing Instincts says: <b>Increases your healing spells by 50/100% of your Agility, and increases healing done to you by 5/10% of your Attack Power while in Cat form.</b><br>
What it <i>actually</i> does is: <b>Increases your healing spells by 50/100% of your Agility, and increases healing done to you by 10/20% while in any form except (Dire) Bear form.</b><br>
<br>
The +20% healing done to you includes iLotP, while in cat form. The +20% healing received does work in caster form, travel form, seal form, etc. just not bear form.<br>
<br>
I also proved that Agi/AP had no impact on healing received in cat form by comparing LB final heal and iLotP heals normally and with Badge of Tenacity activated (casting the heal before activating the badge), and they were the same.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_651453"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->DPS-wise, we have similar "debates" about loot on our runs.<br>
<br>
We only run with 3 tanks: a prot warrior, a prot pally, and myself.  We usually just let the prot pally tank everything now (because he's useless otherwise, and actually has decent threat).  He respecs/sits out for Bloodboil (for which one of our two DPS warriors respecs) and we obviously still use a warrior tank on RoS.<br>
<br>
But mainly, I'm stuck tanking for everything.  I don't get a lot of kitty time with 2-3 tanks.  We use per-instance DKP; and since there is so few pieces of feral-specific loot in BT (not even a weapon), even with taking the DPS upgrades at full cost, I have more DKP than the rogues and warriors who are spending their DKP on weapons and other items. <br>
<br>
So when items like Cursed Vision or Madness drop, there is QQ since my tanking/dps time is probably 70/30. Luckily, our DKP system rules are enforced strictly, and since I have more DKP, I have the right to bid on these items. <br>
<br>
We've been very lucky with glaives -- I think we have 7? -- so I took these items when they dropped (also considering my DKP dwarfed theirs) but I still felt a little awkward considering my ever decreasing time spent in Cat form due to our tank shortage.  <br>
<br>
Now if I sucked at DPS, I probably would of thought twice about taking these items first or second, but when DPSing, I think I offer great utility and DPS for my raid slot.<br>

I think in general, as long as you gem/enchant your stuff, gear according to Toskk (or some of the other DPS rankings), and stay competitive (haste potions, drums, crit stone, agi potions, agi food), you shouldn't feel too bad taking upgrades over other melee DPS.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>It appears that the talent has been changed again, with the entire 'increases healing done to you' aspect removed from it now for simply a flat +Healing bonus. Whether this is just a placeholder until Blizzard is able to make the now-gone part of the new talent work as they intend it to, who knows- this seems to be the way things are for now.<br>

</div>Yes, I tanked our first few Azgalor kills in 2pT4 (Chest/Head) and 3pT5.  That's mostly due to other classes being desperate for those pieces and the limited number of Kael kills we did, but those pieces should serve you well into BT/MH.  T5 pants are fantastic for both bear and cat, those should be one of your first grabs if you're short dkp.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_651705"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->There is really nothing wrong with 4t4 and 1t5 for tanking all the way up to Illidan. I know this because it's what I did (lack of t5 druid drops and we dropped t5 content as soon as we got enough people attuned to mh/bt). <br>
<br>
If you've got a lack of t5 drops, a problem with other people complaining you aren't passing stuff to the tank, or whatever, 4t4 is perfectly good enough all the way through to the end. If you only have the DKP for one piece of t5, grab the legs, they're definitely the best piece/upgrade. 3t5/2t4 is barely an upgrade from 4t4/1t5, but an upgrade is an upgrade whatever happens I suppose.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">DPS-wise, we have similar "debates" about loot on our runs.<br>
<br>
We only run with 3 tanks: a prot warrior, a prot pally, and myself.  We usually just let the prot pally tank everything now (because he's useless otherwise, and actually has decent threat).  He respecs/sits out for Bloodboil (for which one of our two DPS warriors respecs) and we obviously still use a warrior tank on RoS.<br>
<br>
But mainly, I'm stuck tanking for everything.  I don't get a lot of kitty time with 2-3 tanks.  We use per-instance DKP; and since there is so few pieces of feral-specific loot in BT (not even a weapon), even with taking the DPS upgrades at full cost, I have more DKP than the rogues and warriors who are spending their DKP on weapons and other items. <br>
<br>
So when items like Cursed Vision or Madness drop, there is QQ since my tanking/dps time is probably 70/30. Luckily, our DKP system rules are enforced strictly, and since I have more DKP, I have the right to bid on these items. <br>
<br>
We've been very lucky with glaives -- I think we have 7? -- so I took these items when they dropped (also considering my DKP dwarfed theirs) but I still felt a little awkward considering my ever decreasing time spent in Cat form due to our tank shortage.  <br>
<br>
Now if I sucked at DPS, I probably would of thought twice about taking these items first or second, but when DPSing, I think I offer great utility and DPS for my raid slot.<br>
<br>
I think in general, as long as you gem/enchant your stuff, gear according to Toskk (or some of the other DPS rankings), and stay competitive (haste potions, drums, crit stone, agi potions, agi food), you shouldn't feel too bad taking upgrades over other melee DPS.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>I saw it like that too at first, but at the same time, if you look over T6, we dps a decent amount still.  Now since we always run with 2 ferals, I sometimes get to dps on Anetheron and Azgalor, but beyond that I imagine it's the same.  If you're dpsing on Anetheron and Azgalor, you're dps 8 fights, tank 6 fights in T6.  If you don't dps on those, tank 8 fights and dps 6.  Since a prot pally can do just fine at picking up infernals (not sure about doomguards due to silence), you're probably dps'ing at least half the fights.<br>
<br>
Then there's also the trash fights, being able to change from dps to tanking on the fly between each trash pull is quite nice, it's not game breaking, but speeding up trash clears is never a bad thing.<br>
<br>
The big thing about feral druids is that dual purpose role, but what I've noticed in T6 is that on almost every fight, we're in a single role the entire time.  We're not offtanking an add until it dies and then going dps, but rather we're either tanking or dps'ing a whole fight.  The big exception here is Illidan, but honestly, our dps in FR gear is so bad even holy paladins would laugh at it. &gt;&lt; <br>
<br>
Now if one of those two roles gets neglected due to the way many guilds see kitties, what's the point of bringing the dual purpose class?  A bear tank is nice for some things (better threat against the first flame of azzinoth, mother's saberlash, gurtogg OT threat), but it's hardly the only selling point of a feral.  To me it just feels like a waste of potential then.<br>
<br>
Someone else touched on this the previous page, but if you're expected to keep passing on gear, when do you actually upgrade that second aspect to your class?  If ferals never got a cursed vision until all rogues had them, and then again no duplicitous guise until all rogues had them, it's quite possible for them to end up with neither (depending on luck of the drops), while all your rogues have both (and the duplicitous guise is not <i>that</i> big an upgrade from cursed vision).<br>
<br>
I don't know what this is like for other guilds, but I know I'm finding it quite a struggle to justify gear and group placement as kitty (ie the melee group instead of the ghetto group where the rest of the raid that doesn't fit into another group is thrown).  Essentially I'm just another tank, and the fact that I can do damage on the fights that don't require 3 tanks (1 prot 2 feral is our normal tank lineup) is just a nice bonus.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Well for one, being in the "melee group" you are talking about yeilds you nothing but battle shout.... really not noticable (compared to max Synergy), it turns amazing with an enhance shaman, however 2 BM hunters+ 1 Survival hunter + Shaman is also a decent group to be in (even if the Survival hunter isn't contributing to group synergy it is still awesome for rDPS)<br>
<br>
In my opinion you should start bring 3 tanks, Tell the prot pally to go ret OR tell one of the warriors to fury.<br>
<br>
Rogues and hunters will always complain, just get used to it, explain yourself a few times and try your best to befriend them...<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>It's the lack of enhance shaman.<br>
<br>
A resto shaman will drop windfury and str, and nothing else added, which isn't all that great.<br>
<br>
When you have an enhance shaman who twists windfury and GoA, along with str, all improved, on top of the +10% AP, the difference is huge.<br>
<br>
A lot of people have the misconception that ferals don't really benefit from the melee group due to windfury not working (as if that's the only thing the melee group offers), and while we don't get windfury, we easily gain double as much AP as anyone else from unleashed rage, and if your enhance shaman is good by twisting GoA/windfury, you've got a ton of agi as well.  Overall, when you look at it, we can't get windfury at all, but we benefit more from agi than any other melee, and get the same AP as war/pally for str, and gain more AP than anyone else from unleashed rage.  So to pretend feral druids get nothing from the melee group because windfury doesn't work is silly, yet is seems to be a common notion (on top of that we also give crit to the group of course, along with the patch healing from imp lotp).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I recently 'discovered' the benefit of having an enhancement Shaman over a Resto Shaman. The difference is quite large, enough that I normally include one in my regular Karazhan Badge runs. Rather have the Resto Shaman in the caster group and take another Shaman rather than a rogue. (I'm a Feral Tank so the Shaman means less damage and more threat)<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_653320"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->This has been touched on sparsely a couple times, but in anticipation of 2.4 I keep finding myself wondering whether to go for the feral conversion pieces first, or keep the rogue dps set first. Obviously a couple things factor into that decision: 1) we all have yet to see how taxing the (off)tanking requirements are throughout Sunwell, and 2) how much time you spend tanking/off-tanking/dps in your raid.<br>
<br>
Let's assume the following scenario: you're not MT in one-tank fights, trash is trash, and off-tank roles (like soaking Lash-type moves) aren't any more intense than they've been. However, there's a reasonable chance you may be tank #2 on a given day and will be asked to tank something of boss caliber (either as a part of some fight we still haven't seen on PTRs, or whatever... I haven't been keeping up with what the PTR fights have required tank-wise and its against the wishes of the forum mods to discuss those strats anyway). Hence the dilemma; you're mostly going to be DPSing when it counts but can't afford not to progress as a tank.<br>
<br>
Given this context, I'm curious about how you guys picture the transitional period from BT gearset to Sunwell-on-farm gearset.<br>
<br>
I'll start with one path I've considered, as an example. This one assumes that there's some rowdy tanking to be done.<br>
Step 1- Most agree that the new t6 pieces are the ideal minimal way to get 4t6, and by gemming/enchanting for agility they have great cross-over. Go for those asap and use em in both roles.<br>
Step 2- If the Sunwell crafting recipes drop nearly as much as the shitty BT/Hyjal ones, getting a hold of the leather dps pieces should be relatively easy. Use the chest and gloves for dps.<br>
Step 3- I use 4t6+nether shadow... here's where I would consider switching back to 2t4 (helm/shoulders) as soon as I can do it without losing 4t6 (ie- after getting 2 or 3 of the new t6 depending on whether I've already replaced other t6 with the craftables). <br>
Step 4- convert rogue pieces to feral for tanking. this leaves you in 2t4 (helm/sh), 4t6 (new pcs + legs), crafted chest/gloves... which as I understand it is not <i>that</i> far from the theoretical top set.<br>
<br>
<br>
I guess the answer here is very subjective, and if you know you won't be tanking more than trash and lashes there's no reason not to just go for the rogue set.<br>

</div>I have not much to say because i have the exact same plan than you<br>
As i understand, the chest and gloves LWcrafted are equivalent to the rogue sunwell set. <br>
For head and shoulder, there is nothing better than the 2t4, even better than the head ilvl164 that drop on kiljaedan.<br>
And so the 4t6 with the 3 new piecess.<br>
<br>
So in sunwell i will just go for the druid set to tank.<br>
<br>
Of course if someone is not LW, he will need 2 pieces of the rogue set to maximize the dps, most likely chest or gloves or legs, because for the t4 the 2 better pieces are head and shoulder i think.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I don't know about you, but personally I have 12 defense to wrists, and I need that enchant to stay crit immune, meaning the T6 bracers don't fully transfer between roles, since you'd want 12 str for kitty.<br>
<br>
As for the new "feral set" for tanking, that's what I imagine I'll do.  The new "feral set" is a very solid upgrade over T6.  Just went over the calculations, I'm might have made some mistakes, but it still creates a fairly accurate picture overall.<br>
<br>
All these numbers include set bonuses, although the new shoulders have better colors in them than the T6 shoulders (RB vs BY).<br>
<br>
Going from T6 to the new set:<br>
<br>
-30 Str<br>
+35 Agi<br>
+63 Stam<br>
-27 Hit rating<br>
+30 Crit rating<br>
+630 Armor Pen<br>
+ 3 Red Sockets<br>
<br>
And then on the bp you have the set bonuses 4 str on T6 and 4 agi on the new set, but both have RYB so I didn't include either in this list, although it's a lot more reasonable to fit in a yellow gem for the 4 agi bonus than it is to get the 4 str bonus as tank.<br>
<br>
Still, looking at those stats, that's a pretty strong upgrade over T6.  We lose out on str and the 4T6 set bonus, which might put lacerate ahead of swipe again, but it'll remain to be seen how much the 630 AP, 30 CSR, and 35 agi helps in improving swipe damage to the point it passes lacerate again (along with 3 Red sockets, whatever you put in them).  Overall though, I believe it will be well worth the tradeoff (if you can even call that a tradeoff), and this is easily a solid upgrade over the previous set.  In terms of stats, a much bigger upgrade than T5 &gt; T6 was (and we don't need the armor boost, since it's becoming increasingly hard to avoid going over the armor cap these days).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I believe they were in T5, now the helm and shoulders are generally the best slots. <br>
<br>
The shoulders are a very easy choice, after that the helm has a small edge over the gloves for the second choice.  It's not a massive difference, so it's not like you're really missing out by doing gloves/shoulders for T4 and getting the new rogue helm.<br>
<br>
Although gloves are craftable, which is a big bonus and might make them much easier to get than the helm.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

With the new badge gear from 2.4, would it be worth finally dropping 4t4?  I'd love the massive additional stats, though I think I would lose some armor.  I was also considering S3 helm for the anticrit (since I'd get the 2pc bonus) and high stam, so I could socket/enchant more agi.<br>

On a related note, our only true Azgalor attempts have been with me tanking, but our healers don't have much sresist (well under 200 buffed), so I kept dying to silences even though I'd stop attacking to prevent parries.

</div>As overpowered as the 2t4 head/shoulder combo is for dps, you can afford to put tanking enchants in your T6 gear for those slots. Either one would make up for the loss of the tanking enchant on the wrist (especially the <a class="q2" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=29193" target="_blank">[Glyph of the Gladiator]</a>).<br>
<br>
Str and AP are virtually interchangeable. 630 AP vs the loss of 30 str (equivalent to 68 AP with kings + talent) is a 562 AP increase. And honestly, I don't see why you would drop the 4t6 at all. You would simply retain one piece from the old T6 to keep the bonus in a threat tanking set. Given those factors, there is no way the extra bleed damage from Lacerate (which does not count for anywhere near as much threat as the initial hit) is going to outdo swipe for pure threat.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>The JC ring is BoE so no problem there and it seems relatively cheap if you have access to Sunmotes.<br>
[e]If you really couldn't get it/afford it the fallback choice would either be the ZA timed ring or possibly hydross/akama ring if you wanted to make up some hit.<br>
<br>
For hit he has:<br>
<br>
Helm: 5+ (16) = 21<br>
Chest: 5<br>
Legs: 32<br>
Total: 58 hit rating<br>
<br>
Seems the Sunwell pieces are drastically lacking hit.<br>
<br>
If he replaced all the 10 agi with 5hit/5agi you'd be able to get another +45 hit for 45 agility.<br>
Or +90 hit if you went full out with +hit gems (for a total of 148 hit rating).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

and then use +20 hit food instead of +20 agi food.<br>
<br>
According to RawR, it's a 14 dps loss (from ~1464 to ~1450), but at least you would be comforted with the thought that you are still hit capped. Keep in mind that both versions come with 64 Expertise, reducing your "miss" by another 4% due to dodge reduction.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

It was my understanding that we only need 20 EXP rating and that anything over that produced miniscule results to even bother worrying abt.  Assuming the T6 boots haven't changed and still provide that magic number, can someone plz explain why rawr shows Shard of Contempt as being better than a Tsunami or Madness which provide what would appear to be more wothwhile stats and still have nice procs?<br>
<br>

</div>That was when it was Feral Combat Skill. Expertise functions differently than FCS did, reducing the targets chance to dodge or parry your attacks linerarly as your rating increases. Someone correct me if I'm wrong but I believe it takes ~94 Expertise rating for you to mitigate a level 73 boss's dodges while doing DPS.<br>
<br>
For DPS, Expertise Rating has an effect similar to Hit Rating, making the Shard of Contempt pretty good, and possibly better than the two trinkets you mention. For tanking, it's even better as it mitigates your chance to be parried and dodged, increasing your threat.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>The main benefit of removing all avoidance, beyond the easily quantified direct DPS increase you listed, is that you never have to worry about your cat form dps cycles being disrupted by miss/dodge.  <br>
<br>
His point was that simply capping hit is no more effective at reducing cycle disruption than is increasing both hit and expertise at the same time, since a "dodge" is simply a "miss" with a different name.</div>

People often think that once hit capped the cycle is 100% but fail to remember that the cycle can still "miss" due to being dodged. So if the goal of being hit capped is a reliable cycle, then the true goal is actually to be hit and exp capped. One without the other is not really anything that special in light of this goal.</div>

</div>That's actually not true. You can prove this simply: turn your crit up to 70%, hit and expertise to 0, take the 2t4 and 2t6 bonuses, and shift every cycle. You'll be bound to not hit one of every 10 or so rips, which takes a GCD to try again-- so one of every cycle is 13 seconds instead of 12. Yet, your average cycle time in Toskk's is still 12s. <br>
 <br>
There is a similar effect on cycle time if you get a worst-case cycle: if you rip, then miss mangle, then hit mangle, then hit two shreds (but not crit), and get no energy procs, you have 3cp. The time of this isn't averaged, rather the times of all your cycles is averaged so that your best-case cycles which would last 10s balance out the ones that take 14s, and extra shreds are added in. Again, your average cycle time is longer, which means that you use more mangles or shreds and fewer rips in the fight. More hit rating mitigates this to a degree. <br>
 <br>
A more common situation you may find yourself in, even if you have supposed 12s cycles, is having to wait on energy from time to time. <br>
 <br>
I've had a discussion with Toskk about this on his forums (sometime in November) but modeling all of these properly would take a massive investment of time. Rather than taking average energy gain, you need to calculate chances of energy droughts. Rather than an average cycle, you need to calculate probabilities of every cycle, with energy procs and without (and account for when you get them). It's messy as hell, and I don't blame him for not modeling this part-- it's orders of magnitude more work for comparatively little return. <br>
 <br>
Until that work is done, though, the tool will incorrectly report optimal cycle times, which will in turn incorrectly report optimal DPS, since you'll be using a different ratio of mangles, shreds, and rips.  <br>
 <br>
While Toskk's has proven to be a relatively accurate ballparking tool, and possibly the best we'll get, let's be clear: it's not perfect.</div>

		<div id="post_message_655347">The benefit of hit/expertise is better modelled by looking at the bad things that missing/dodging do:<br>
<br>
1. Missing Autoattacks do no damage.<br>
2. Missing Finishers do no damage and refund no energy.<br>
3. Missing Specials (Mangle, Shred) do no damage but refund ~82% energy.<br>
4. Missing a Mangle after applying Rip will cause your first rip tick to do 30% less damage.<br>
5. Missing a Clearcast-Special does no damage and does not refund energy either.<br>
6. Missing will reduce your 2t4 and Clearcast proc rates accordingly.<br>
7. Having a particularly bad missing streak may cause your energy pool to 'overload' or completely throw you out of your cycle.<br>
8. Missing repeatedly will cause gcd issues.<br>
<br>
I believe only 1-3 are covered in the common dps calculators, so the real value of hit is a bit higher than those are telling you. Though the impact of points 4-8 are not that big, they should be considered nonetheless.<br>
<br>
Expertise is of slightly more value than hit because you will also have to deal with parry in some encounters (gorefiend for example will turn quite frequently). Expertise has twice the value of hit in scenarios with parry (mainly while tanking).<br>
<br>
Keep in mind that expertise is not only more TPS and reliability for a tank, it will also slightly reduce incoming damage due to less parries.</div>

</div>One minor issue that I've found, and excuse me if this was accounted for in this list by the fact that not everyone is a JC, is that RAWR does not have the correct stats on Hard Khorium Choker, namely that it's missing the gem slot. Using a relatively optimal melee group and most standard raid armor debuffs shows the choker gemmed with glinting pyrestone ahead of Clutch of Demise. Also, depending on if and how Shoulders of Vehemence are changed, the fact that the choker satisfies a yellow requirement for meta could allow for higher DPS without the use of T4. The alt Shoulders of Vehemence Astrylian put in combined with Duplicitous Guise have significant enough stats to overcome the T4 set bonus, and puts overall "missed" attacks much closer to 0%. Regardless though, in terms of raid distribution of gear, the minor DPS increase (if any) of these two sunwell pieces probably doesn't outweigh the fact of already having T4.</div>

</div>Yes, Allev is noting a few of the difficulties involved with a combat model rather than a combat simulator. The basic problem comes down to averages rather than reality. For example, in the model if the average cycle time is greater than 12.00s, on average you won't be throwing in an extra Shred to compensate for extra energy. But *some* cycles would still be below 12.00s, requiring an extra Shred, even if the *average* cycle is greater than 12.00s. This unfortunately cannot be modeled effectively, as it would require computation of the probability of every possible attack cycle..I did actually create two combat simulators as well as the current combat model, and unfortunately neither of them are workable because of the amount of recursion involved.<br>
<br>
In order for a combat simulator to *begin* to give reasonable averages, it takes well over 500 simulated cycles (I'd personally use no fewer than 1000 cycles). That amount of recursion in Javascript almost immediately causes web browsers to grow suspicious of the script and start throwing errors, not to mention takes like 60 seconds to actually finish.<br>
<br>
I do have eventual plans to move to a new calculator format (probably using Java), one that would not hate me for attempting to force it to compute thousands of sustained DPS cycles for every variable I want to manipulate. Until that time, however, the comparisons between the current combat model and the combat simulators I created were very close anyway, with most stats typically differing from the model values by no more than 0.2 Kitty Points.</div>

</div>Im guessing any class can max out their char with self designed items. If you put this to an extreme you would just earn raid tokens and then assign your stats and specc in the login screen. Not a game i would continue to play.<br>
<br>
Id rather think that having one weapon acting as both cat and bear items would solve this problem best. That would mean though that you cant have stats on the item that only boosts one of the 2 forms, otherwise you create a problem with it not being an upgrade to the last tier for the other form or the next tier wont be one.<br>
<br>
So fixed sta, agi, feral ap and hit/expertise scaling and no other stats on the item ever. No def, armor, str, armor penetration or crit rating. I think feral ap already scales only with ilvl, there are no "out of line" items for that stat.<br>
<br>
Then less people would whine about the wrong kind of feral staff being implemented in this or that instance.<br>
<br>

</div>Or they could just include one bear and one cat staff in each tier.  I mean, there are 3 epic melee daggers in sunwell, and only the minority spec of one class uses daggers.  There are multiple healer, caster, and tank weapons.  Is it really so hard to include one staff for bears and another for cats?  Hell, you could even make one of the weapons one of the sunmote trade-ins.</div>

</div>I'm my mind it is inexcusable for any feral item to have dodge or crit ratings.  Why? Agility is designed to give more to Feral Druids than these stats do.  Sure if we use an item designed for another class we may have to make do, but for items specifically designed for us there is no point.  Similarly with regards to Int on items that will be used to Tank (a little Int is ok on hybrid/dps items), or Strength on tanking items, so on and so forth.<br>
<br>
If this makes druids too powerful, then change the ratios so that we get less from these stats.  Making the game harder, or gimping a specific class, through poor itemization, is just plain insulting.  We know what is good for our classes, and it is becoming painfully obvious that we know much better than Blizzard .<br>
<br>
Personally I would *LOVE* a game that allowed us to allocate the stat points on our items.  I know what I want to, I know how to do what I want to do.  Let me do it.</div>

</div>The notion that crit on items is bad isn't necessarily true so long as it's paired with agi on the item and has been pointed out before, simply because of how item stat distribution works. The broader the number of stats an item has, the more each stat can be increased. As an example, an item with only 100 agi could also be converted to 90 agi and 27 crit rating while at the same ilvl and quality. I would assume the latter would be more appealing to most any feral druid out there. Due to this item stat distribution, it's actually quite a benefit to us if we had as many stats per item as we could get for total net benefit. Having our main pieces with armor, str, agi, stam, int, crit, hit, expertise, armor pen, haste, *insert whatever new mechanic they add here* on each piece would give more total stats than if each stat were isolated across different gear. Ideal is a term we can argue over all we want, but for myself at least, having items like that, modified by having weapon, jewelry and cloak pieces determine our role as tank or dps, would be pretty ideal.</div>

Mace of Feral Tankage<br>
Binds when picked up<br>
Two-Hand Mace<br>
136.5 - 305.5 Damage Speed 3.00<br>

Swapped 350 Armor Penetration for 525 Armor (350*.15/.1 = 525)<br>
Swapped Agility for Stamina (no effect on ilvl, stamina goes to 112, Agility to 33)<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">As overpowered as the 2t4 head/shoulder combo is for dps, you can afford to put tanking enchants in your T6 gear for those slots. Either one would make up for the loss of the tanking enchant on the wrist (especially the <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=29193"><span><span class="greenname">[Glyph of the Gladiator]</span></span></a>).<br>
<br>
Str and AP are virtually interchangeable. 630 AP vs the loss of 30 str (equivalent to 68 AP with kings + talent) is a 562 AP increase. And honestly, I don't see why you would drop the 4t6 at all. You would simply retain one piece from the old T6 to keep the bonus in a threat tanking set. Given those factors, there is no way the extra bleed damage from Lacerate (which does not count for anywhere near as much threat as the initial hit) is going to outdo swipe for pure threat.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>That was, perhaps, a poor abbreviation on my part, the AP there was Armor Pen, not attack power.  <br>
<br>
Now as for the bracer enchant, even with both the my helm and shoulders enchanted for defense, and jewelry with defense on it, along with a shadowmoon insignia, I'm still not defense capped unless I put defense on my bracers or gem for defense (and defense to bracers is far better in terms of budget then).<br>
<br>
Honestly, I see no point of removing a superior piece of gear to gain the 4T6 set bonus, unless you are tanking several mobs at once and swipe threat actually matters.<br>
<br>
If lacerate outperforms swipe without 4T6, and swipe barely outperforms lacerate with 4T6, at the cost of a worse piece of gear, why bother?  Even when you reach the point where swipe puts out more than the base threat of lacerate (which is 285 or 290 I believe), there's still the bleed damage.  Despite the massive threat reduction on the bleed damage, it is still a decent amount of threat, and I don't think swipe currently reaches the point where it is more efficient to simply spam swipe entirely and ignore at least keeping lacerate up (all theoretical of course).  Now we're talking about really minor differences in tps here anyway.  So looking at it like that, unless you're actually using swipe to tank multiple mobs, or the extra tiny bit of damage matters that much, I can't see a reason to swap out a piece to get 4T6 swipes, instead of just using lacerate.<br>
<br>
Course swipe does benefit from all that armor pen, while lacerate doesn't really. &gt;&lt;</div>

I agree, 2pc T4 is useless for tanking. I actually tank 5 man regular/heroics in full dps gear, with a good healer I haven't had any issues with rage and TPS is always high in dps gear along high high amount of dodge.</div>

		<div id="post_message_656107"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Hi!<br>
<br>
I have just played with Rawr.Cat and Toskks calculator, i noticed that <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32591" target="_blank">[Choker of Serrated Blades]</a> is rated higher than <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=29381" target="_blank">[Choker of Vile Intent]</a> for some Bosses with lower armor, whereas the Choker is better for Bosses with higher Armor. <br>
<br>
Is there an addon that calculates stat values that precise ingame, looking at your current buffs+debuffs (we sometimes have a rogue keeping imp. Expose Armor on), such that you can adjust your gear right before the pull.<br>
Or at least an Addon with different stat weights configurable?<br>
<br>
Regarding the <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=1" target="_blank">[Item 'staff of feral tankage' not found!]</a>.. do you think we could be able to do something about it by reporting the dps Staff on the PTR with our desired values, or is it already too late?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

That addon does essentially just that. And you can create different "sets" which are just different formulas for stat weighting. For instance i have 1 for weighting healing gear assuming I'm in a tank group where it counts spirit as both an aura and as mana regen, and a different formula that counts spirit as only regen, and it just lists both values on the tooltip of any item. So you could setup a tanking formula, a dps formula, a low armor boss dps formula, a mitigation over sta formula, and whatever else you wanted.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Then general formula is:<br>
<br>
StatValue: the amount of the stat on the item<br>
StatMod: the value associated with the stat (Most stats/ratings are 1, stamina is .666, armor is .1, armor penetration is .15)<br>
<br>
((StatValue1*StatMod1)^1.5 + ... + (StatValueN*StatModN)^1.5)^.666<br>
<br>
All the stats assigned have either been direct swaps (i.e. 350 armor penetration = 525 Armor) or have been based on the formula above.<br>
<br>
As per the stamina:<br>
The original was<br>
75 Agility<br>
50 Stamina<br>
<br>
And these value were directly swapped, however Stamina has a lower value than the standard stats, so this swap yields<br>
112 Stamina<br>
33 Agility<br>
<br>
If you plug these value into the above formula (noting the StatMod of .666 for Stamina), you will get the exact same ilvl.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

The ones using 3 stats are even better, as that invoker chest is even more points by your formula.<br>
<br>
basing things on the formula works. direct swaps ignoring the formula do not. if it adds up right in the formula, its fine. However, because of the part of the equation where its raised to the 1.5, that's where stacking 1 stat gets penalized.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

It appears that the talent has been changed again, with the entire 'increases healing done to you' aspect removed from it now for simply a flat +Healing bonus. Whether this is just a placeholder until Blizzard is able to make the now-gone part of the new talent work as they intend it to, who knows- this seems to be the way things are for now.<br>

</div>I never ignore the formula.  Take the of the eagle gear 39/60 int/stam.  Swapping all the Int for Spi yields the exact same ilvl.  Moving any amount of Int to Stam does not.<br>
<br>
To everyone (and no one in particular): this isn't about ilvl, it was just a suggestion with an example.  I don't think we should go through the basics of the ilvl formula here.  If you have a problem with my item, prove it with the formula, otherwise go read the wiki and other articles and don't post about ilvl:P.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_656561"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->This may be a bit off the current topic, but, I have some questions regarding bear tanking.  Specifically: How do you do it?<br>
<br>
The common knowledge floating around online is that tanking is typically one of the more difficult things to do for PvE content.  Having sat through excruciating heroics with terrible tanks, it would seem that this is true.  However, in practice, I find it to be extremely easy... boring really.  As a bear offtank, I'm currently sitting with full t4, having done most of the game's pre-raid and beginning raid content.  As I move through SSC, I'm not really finding encounters very difficult.  <br>
<br>
The most work I have to do to hold aggro and mitigate damage is to autoattack and spam 3 button at once.  <br>
<br>
If you compare this to how much effort my guild's MT, a warrior, is putting into his tanking it gets pretty pathetic.  I'm falling asleep while he's drinking his third mountain dew!<br>
<br>
I understand that Blizzard can't give one form too much utility- because a Druid has to be thought of in terms of all of its forms.  But as a tank, you're not going to be swapping forms- you're stuck with a very small moveset.  It's simply too risky to shift.   <br>
<br>
So am I doing anything wrong?  Is it this boring through the entire game?  Should I just reroll a more active/reactive class?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>You're correct.  I should have flipped that sign.<br>
<br>
And, no, I didn't forget to include multiple mobs into the equation.  Because by then I'm already asleep at the sheer boredom that is bear tanking.<br>
<br>
Honestly though, I feel Druids need an overhaul.  Given how specialized you have to gear/spec yourself to fill each role, there's no risk to giving a bit more utility to a given form and have it be too powerful.  Blizzard seems to be stuck in the mentality that druids are shape shifting all over the place.  Well, not as tanks at least.  Blizzard *seemed* to be moving in the right direction with all the tier loot being such amazing hybrid Bear/Cat.  But it doesn't solve the problem of being stuck in a pve role.<br>
<br>
Perhaps if Barkskin were buffed to allow bear hp/armor bonus in other forms, we could play around with a bit more utility.  Perhaps shift out of bear-&gt;hurricane during a boss fight!  Or Shift-&gt;Cat-&gt;Shred a fleeing mob in the back......  hmmm.  No, I guess that'd be too much fun <!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_656683"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I noticed that there isn't any mention of threat cycles in the inital posts like the prot warrior thread has. Not that druids have too much problems with threat, but it may be something you wish to add. My preferred rotation would be mangle, lacerate, swipe, swipe and repeat with maul queued to burn any excess rage. In 2.4 with lacerate AP scaling I think this should be close to an optimal rotation. Under a hit/expertise capped scenario, and with 400+ mangled lacerate ticks, using lacerate every 6 sec should be generating 285 + 0.2(2*400+initial dmg) threat. At 30% crit, the average non-crit swipe would have to be greater than 323 dmg. Even with ArPen and 4t6, that's a pretty difficult number to reach in tanking gear. Considering dmg/rage in this rotation, lacerate's providing around 850 dmg for 13 rage as well, making it significantly better than swipe for single target dps.<br>
<br>
This is based on hit/expertise cap though, and if that were truly possible, the actual optimal rotation would be only lacerating every other cycle. Due to having to deal with "misses" the player would have to substitute lacerates in for swipes as needed when it gets missed to have buffer time to maintain the stacks. It's somewhat interesting that in the non-hit/expertise capped scenario, even with assuming only 80% mangle uptime, that lacerate pulls even further ahead of swipe. This is due to swipe, if missed/dodged/parried loses all its potential dmg whereas with lacerate, missing means you've actually gotten an extra half tick or more of dmg from the previous lacerate, so long as the stack remains. This is all napkin math so bear with me:<br>
<br>
Threat from lacerate: 285 + 0.2(2*400)*0.8 mangle time and ignoring inital dmg = 413 (would be 445 with 100% mangle time i.e. the hit/exp cap)<br>
Swipe dmg needed with hit/expertise cap (30% crit): 413 = 0.7x + 0.3*2.26x; x = 299 (323 in actuality due to 100% mangle)<br>
Swipe dmg needed with 20% miss, 30% crit: 413 = 0.2*0*x + 0.5x + 0.3*2.26x; x = 350<br>
<br>
The reason the inital dmg of lacerate is being ignored is because I wanted to create a worst case scenario for lacerate so long as the stacks didn't fall. The longer lacerate ticks before being refreshed, the stronger it is for the rage/gcd spent on it. For reference sake, 400 dmg ticks for lacerate are obtainable with 2500 ap so long as you have naturalist and have mangle up. Even the current version, at an avg of 177-180 dmg per tick, is worth using, at least for me since my WWS seem to show I only land about 82-85% of my attacks.<br>
<br>
This is also of course for bleed vulnerable mobs. On mobs like void reaver and supremus I swipe spam, but I think I remember something stating increasing the bleed and poison vulnerability of many mobs in the next patch. In any case, those are my two cents on lacerate.<br>
<br>
Edit: mangle, lacerate, swipe 2x is the base rotation for use, but once a lacerate is missed, the best thing to do is refresh it, and once refreshed, wait 6 sec (or 7.5 if it would have taken place of mangle) before using it again, so the cycle could be altered to mangle, swipe, lacerate, swipe or mangle, swipe 2x, lacerate depending on how lacerates land.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I've seen a few people do this, and don't understand what the point is. The only thing growl does when a mob is already on you is prevents someone from pulling off you while the debuff lasts. It adds no threat. Why not save it in case some dps gets a lucky crit, or you get a string of unlucky misses and the mob is pulled off you?<br>
<br>
My personal pulling strat goes like this:<br>
<br>
1. Lifebloom<br>
2. Dire Bear Form<br>
3. Faerie Fire<br>
4. Auto-attack<br>
5. Mangle<br>
<br>
The bloom on lifebloom + FF gives you a decent enough buffer that if both your auto-attack and mangle miss, the healers won't pull off you on their first heal.<br>
<br>
<br>
EDIT: My bad, I must have misread G as Q... even when I quoted it. Sigh. Still, I see quite a few tanks (both warriors and druids) who taunt/growl before anything else on a pull.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I have just played with Rawr.Cat and Toskks calculator, i noticed that <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32591" target="_blank">[Choker of Serrated Blades]</a> is rated higher than <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=29381" target="_blank">[Choker of Vile Intent]</a> for some Bosses with lower armor, whereas the Choker is better for Bosses with higher Armor. <br>
<br>
Is there an addon that calculates stat values that precise ingame, looking at your current buffs+debuffs (we sometimes have a rogue keeping imp. Expose Armor on), such that you can adjust your gear right before the pull.<br>
Or at least an Addon with different stat weights configurable?<br>
<br>
Regarding the <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=1" target="_blank">[Item 'staff of feral tankage' not found!]</a>.. do you think we could be able to do something about it by reporting the dps Staff on the PTR with our desired values, or is it already too late?</div>

</div>Re-read the initial post section on Threat Generation (in the Bear Post) and suggest what needs changing. Your post is mostly a rehash of that section, so apart from an exact "do this cycle" layout that could be added, I can't see what needs changing. I don't believe that there is a need for an exact "do this" layout anyway, as the post implies to use Mangle always whenever it's up, and swipe or lacerate is down to mob/situation specifics. <br>
<br>
As it currently stands I'm trying to keep 2.4 information out of the main post due to confusion, no exact knowledge of when the release to live will be, and no confirmation that they're done with changes. As soon as something concrete happens with regards to 2.4, I'll go through the main post and update it.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

- Maul. As above, use when you have a lot of rage and don't use if you're rage starved a lot.<br>

Generally the point where swipe overtakes lacerate in terms of threat output is when it's doing ~225 damage to the target normally - this value varies dependant on bleed immunity and whether you're keeping 5 stacks up as well as crit chance </strong>

</div>I suppose my main concern is the concept that the bleed is insignificant threat and that maintaining the 5 stacks is trivial. Even with the live version of lacerate it doesn't seem to be the case. Because of the hit/expertise issues with lacerate and swipe that I had mentioned before, the equivalent break point in lacerate v. swipe threat looks more like this:<br>
<br>
Lacerate: 285 + 0.2(threat)*1.3(mangle)*.85(mangle uptime)*1.1(naturalist)*2*155(two 5-stack lacerate ticks) = 360<br>
Swipe: 0.15*0(miss/parry/dodge) + 0.3*2.26x(crit) + 0.55x(hit) = 360 =&gt; x = 293 normal hit swipes<br>
<br>
I do see you mention the variation of the value dependency varying with bleed vulnerability and the 5 stack maintenance, but a 293 swipe is quite a ways from a 225 dmg swipe. Against a mob with 0 armor, the ap difference is about 865, and still 752 with 4t6. The amount of lacerate dmg calculated was based on lacerate use every 6 seconds on average, and I was hoping it could lead to some more theorycraft on how to optimally use lacerate considering its upcoming buff. The move is interesting in that when spammed, only gets half a tick of bleed of threat per lacerate, but when used every 3 sec, gets one tick per lacerate, if every 6, gets 2 ticks per, every 12, gets 4 ticks per (best if hit/exp capped). My previous post was made because I don't hit 293 swipes normally while tanking, even with 4t6 (which still takes close to 2900 ap with 20% armor mitigation), and so long as lacerates are spaced by at least 6 sec, it does appear worthwhile enough to spend a gcd on that over a swipe, though I probably should have added the quick math for the live version there as well. One additional thing is that lacerate used in this way is more dmg per gcd than swipe too in case that bit of rdps is important, albeit at the cost of a raid debuff slot.<br>
<br>
Also, I felt that it would be noteworthy to explicitly state that because mangle is on a 6 sec cd that only 3 global cds are available in between mangles, something not all new feral druids are aware of and spamming swipes/lacerates may burn more gcds than intended to maximize their mangling.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_657084"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I just finished reading 57 pages on the other thread, to get redirected to this one, therefore I'm sorry if this has already been discussed before, but my eyes are already hurting <br>
<br>
I currently have 3 pieces of T4, and I passed on the legs and chest, although I'm getting the legs next time around! My question's realated to the upcoming patch, with the introduction of the new Chest piece, Ring and Trinket, my math doesn't seem to get around to make up for the crit immune cap with defense+resilience.<br>
<br>
Are there any other Druids out there around the same level of content that have figured this out? The only possibility I've come up with is to forget the Ring or the Trinket, meaning either get Mag's ring and keep it in order to be able to use the new trinket, or get <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30629" target="_blank">[Scarab of Displacement]</a> and use the new Ring.<br>
<br>
I'm also facing this problem with <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30021" target="_blank">[Wildfury Greatstaff]</a>, if I loose the def rating from EW, I go below the crit immunity.<br>
<br>
Any thoughts as to what path I should follow?<br>
<br>
<br>

The defense one is a lot of defense, but probably unnecessary given the new options in enchanting your gear. The passive effect may help oh no macro's, but seems minimally useful compared to better stats or an avoidance type proc.<br>
<br>
I'm really lookin at that huge amount of crit on the Assassin's. Which trinkets does it beat out?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

Edit: Really I was wondering if this makes Alchemy worth considering as a replacement to one of LW/Enchanting/JC. My intuition tells me no.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I too was considering dropping Alchemy and this does pose an interesting question.<br>
I picked up Alchemy as I thought the stone was quite a nice item for a druid, it wasn't horrible for cat or bear but now there are much better options for both and its use in fights where you need to heal instead is greatly diminished due to all the mana regen changes.<br>
Still not convinced it is worth keeping based on the ones linked in the picture above but I might wait on choosing something else as they might improve them further.  It is good to see that they are considering improvements to it as it doesn't really supply anything an alt can't if you don't use the current trinket.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_657225"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I've been on the verge of dropping Alchemy for a while now as well. To be honest these changes aren't enough to make me stick with it. Might theorycraft the crit rating one but can't see it beating out Madness/DST/Tsunami or the new Expertise one. <br>
<br>
Looks like crit cap isn't going to be a problem in the new patch though which is great. Back, wrist, helm, chest should definately allow us to drop 1 item, the PvP bracers that most druids use seems to be a good choice for this to sub in the new T6 bracers and allow us to keep the bonus whilst upgrading our mainstay T6 to the new SW items. The tough decision will be which piece of current T6 to keep over the new gear for the bonus.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">thoughts on the new alchemy stones? spreadsheet values?<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080417225401/http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/february/alchemystones.jpg" target="_blank">http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/...hemystones.jpg</a><br>
<br>
The defense one is a lot of defense, but probably unnecessary given the new options in enchanting your gear. The passive effect may help oh no macro's, but seems minimally useful compared to better stats or an avoidance type proc.<br>
<br>
I'm really lookin at that huge amount of crit on the Assassin's. Which trinkets does it beat out?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Edit: Really I was wondering if this makes Alchemy worth considering as a replacement to one of LW/Enchanting/JC. My intuition tells me no.</div>

	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>It feels more like a sidegrade for ferals, if anything. With my current gear in rawr, the current stone gives me 1500 overall points. When over the crit-cap, 54def is 1075 points.<br>
<br>
Swapping out 2pc S3 to drop me to 0.94% chance to be crit (need 57 def rating, so no point on the new trinket goes wasted) puts the old stone at 1653 and new one at 2130.<br>
<br>
If you need all 54 defense rating to reach immunity, it's a nice trinket (up to you if it's worth 16 airs + 2 vortexes.) If you don't need the full 54, it's not really that great. <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32658" target="_blank">[Badge of Tenacity]</a>, <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=34473" target="_blank">[Commendation of Kael'thas]</a>, <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=31858" target="_blank">[Darkmoon Card: Vengeance]</a>, and <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32501" target="_blank">[Shadowmoon Insignia]</a> all far surpass it.<br>
<br>
Now, if they made it a true tiered upgrade and kept the current 15 stats and simply added defense it might be viable. Yes, obviously it won't be 54 defense, but 15str/agi/sta 30-35def would still be a pretty nice trinket close to the insignia.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_658234"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->So, long-time question I've had ruminating in the back of my mind. <br>
<br>
Say you're in a fight, doing your typical cycle, and you hit a miss streak/get AOE stunned or feared/ran out to combat rez/etc.   You end up caught in the middle of the cycle with 3 CP and there is no mangle or rip still up on the boss.   Do you:<br>
<br>
A) Mangle to get your 4th (and possibly 5th CP) and rip ASAP, then shred.  Thus losing only a tic of mangled rip, but possibly short-changing your next cycle, meaning you may be stuck like this for many cycles.  Switch to normal cycle as soon as you can get 4 CP up, or when you can't get up to 3 before your mangle expires.<br>
<br>
B) Use an un-mangled shred to get your 4th CP, then resume cycle normally. <br>
<br>
C) Mangle for your 4th CP, then resume cycle normally. <br>
<br>
I personally try to pull A off as much as possible, but B might be the best option; I'm having trouble getting my head around an alternate-cycle plan.  I have an itchy feeling that the answer depends on cycle time, though.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
Under raid conditions, you can expect to mangle five times a minute if no one else is keeping it up for you.  With a 40% proc, that's 16 seconds of +140 strength per minute.  Averaged out, it's equivalent to adding 37 strength passively.  BOK and SOTF make this roughly 84 ap.  <br>
<br>
Doing the same math for Hourglass of the Unraveller yields 32 crit rating and 50 ap passive.  Bloodlust Brooch comes out to about 118 ap, Darkmoon Card: Crusade comes to 120 ap, and Crystalforged Trinket comes to 134 ap.  All of these should be superior under common raid conditions.<br>
<br>
I'm thinking this may have been left unchanged since 2.3, as all the other trinkets now benefit from heart of the wild and ATE has lost some of its effectiveness.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

danpct: Yes, the ATE has become weaker since 2.3, and as most of the rest have gained in power since then it probably shouldn't be so far down the list. Still, it depends on how you play and if you're the designated "mangle-bot" or whatever.<br>

		<div id="post_message_658473"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->It'll vary based on what you're currently wearing and what higher armor upgrades you'll be picking up over time as to <i>when</i> exactly you feel comfortable making the armor sacrifice on a ring slot. Another consideration has to be the hit rating on the ring, on trash or in an OT situation you'll find the hit really useful whereas being armor capped may not be as important. It's very subjective, and having more options never hurts. Sure, if you won't be using it 100% of the time, let your other tanks grab it first, but don't reject it outright as an option either.<br>
<br>
Gem choices have a lot to do with your raid role. If you are 1st or 2nd in line for maintanking a boss, you want to focus on Stamina, but if you're mainly a first trash mob kill tank, you'll want lots of Agility for the dodge and crit. Figure out what ratio of tanking vs OT/dps you do and gem appropriately. E.g. my old raid guild had no Protection Warriors at all, so I would maintank everything, and generally went Sta in all gem slots except where it was possible to pick up a decent socket bonus. In my new guild, I don't foresee myself maintanking anything significant so I'll be switching to Agi/Sta gems from now on in most if not all sockets.<br>
<br>
I believe most Bears use Pillar most of the time since it has a higher "survivability" component than Wildfury and much higher threat, despite not having avoidance. Wildfury will "mitigate" more damage over any given fight, but Pillar also has a decent gob of Stamina. Of course the proper answer to this is: keep both in your bags and use the right one for the job at any given time (e.g. dodge on Gurtogg). Again, don't reject it outright as an option, a Pillar in your bag is far more beneficial than 2 void crystals in the guild bank.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I notice a lot of druids pick up the <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32261" target="_blank">[Band of the Abyssal Lord]</a> despite the fact that you lose a large amount of armor to get it.  I imagine this is when you're at the point where you're capped or close to it and can afford that loss, but I'm wondering at what point this is?  I just started BT this past week and one dropped on our first night but I passed because I wasn't sure if I could really afford to lose that much armor yet until I got some T6 level drops.  General overview of gear is I'm at 4/5 T5 everything but chest, or you can check my armory.  <br>
<br>
Another question I had was with regards to gemming <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30042" target="_blank">[Belt of Natural Power]</a> with BT gems which way to go? 10 agi, 5 agi 7 stam, 15 stam?<br>
<br>
And finally, <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30021" target="_blank">[Wildfury Greatstaff]</a> is considered better for tanking than <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30883" target="_blank">[Pillar of Ferocity]</a>, but are there times when you use the pillar?  I hopefully will have S3 staff soon for dps if I can get my rating a bit higher so I'm wondering if I should even pick up a pillar?</div>

</div>Mitigation is not everything, there is a point where your dps(especially warlock) will do so much dps, that you cannot made enough aggro. So at that point, you need to improve youre hit/expertise/crit, eventually with some dps gear, but the band of the abyssal lord is a very good mix with lots of def and hit.<br>
And for the belt, personnally i gemmed it with 15endu, and i use another belt dps gemmed with agi when the boss dont hit too hard.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_658756"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->So my guild just downed Azgalor for the first time, and I was fortunate enough to receive the t6 gloves.  I proceeded to gem them with a Solid Empyrean Sapphire and enchant with 15agi.  I won't be able to replace that gem for some time, if ever, since my guild is holding gems for best-in-slot gear only.  I actually have the first BT gemmed piece of gear in the guild.  I would have gotten the 5agi/7stam, but that pattern hasn't dropped for us yet.  Was 15 stam a better gem choice than 10 agi?<br>
<br>
Important bits of info: I tank Azgalor, since our best geared tank, who was also the guild MT, just had to quit raiding for RL reasons .  So stam is becoming a lot more important to me, since it looks like I'll be MTing more often, which I've never done post ZA.  I run at around 21.5k raid buffed HP, a little more with commanding shout.  My unbuffed dodge is 36.5; I forget that it reaches with full dodge buffs.  In that case, should I forsake agi in my gems and enchants and go straight stam, or am I at a comfortable enough HP lvl that I can start stacking more agi for better dodge?<br>

</div>Yeah that's a really good point.  I've also already got the badge ring and badge pants on my "I've got to have enough badges by the time this vendor becomes available" list, which used to include the gloves till I got T6.  I may go for the chest too, since I'm currently using S3 for the resil.  With the resil head enchant, the def enchant for cloak, and resil enchant on the badge chest... I could probably be uncrittable despite the badge ring's lack of def.  Those badge pieces will *significantly* boost my HP, which I'm really looking forward to.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_658815"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I'm re-evaluating my gear now.<br>
<br>
As both our Prot Warriors were away this week I ended up MT for all of MH and Naj/Supremus last night. My main issue was that on fights where threat matters I was running into issues with rage starvation. Quite simply I was getting dodge streaks so badly that I was having to work really hard to stay ahead of the Warlocks/Mages, even up to the 50% mark when they could Invis/Soulshatter.<br>
<br>
Great news for our healers of course, but ultimately on farm encounters they should now have the experience to keep me alive without me having to mitigate every last point of damage I can. I'm looking at gear and thinking about dropping down to about 45% buffed dodge in exchange for +hit, expertise and more ap/crit, this is probably going to mean dropping some high armor items such as the rings/neck/staff in favour of more dps/threat oriented gear.<br>
<br>
I did a quick and dirty gear swap for Supremus to test out - I'm wearing the gear here: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080410191546/http://armory.wow-europe.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Xavius&amp;n=Daboran" target="_blank">The World of Warcraft Armory</a><br>
<br>
<br>
Although it's a small thing, the AP scaling on Lacerate in 2.4 is a welcome change for me. Every little helps when your dps start gearing up this far.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Your rotation is fine, other than maybe you need to use maul more frequently if you find yourself rage capped. Against mobs that don't hit quite as hard, you can sub out 1 or 2 pure tanking pieces for hybrid or DPS pieces (without sacrificing crit immunity)<br>

On another note please don't use excalamation mark (!) as much; it kind of hurts my eyes, hehe<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Can you elaborate? I assume anyone attempting those bosses seriously would be uncrittable and close to armor capped as would be expected. Are you saying that 20k with high dodge won't cut it?<br>

Has anyone had experience to the contrary? Seems like this would be good to know for gear prep for 2.4...

</div>Changing talent for a energy recovery move is much more important than having T4 bonus moved to newer items. We'll just end up using that item until something drastically better come out, and this "petition" of moving energy recovery proc will start all over again. Adding it to feral Tenacity will be good, as 15% stun/fear resist, while good, is lackluster for a talent that deep into any tree. Most classes with said talents get it in their first 3 tiers.<br>
<br>
On a sidenote, Sunwell Shoulders+ Helm (lol Kil'jaeden) combination will only lose to T4 helm/shoulder by about 7 dps when fully raid buffed, consumabled, boss having squishy armor (6200) and fully debuffed with everything possible. This set up also has about 2% more -avoidance to mob than T4. At theoretical DPS of 2100, 7 DPs is really, really minor, and some people will choose the consistency that the T6.5 pieces offer.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_659158"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->So I've been using Voldin's spreadsheet.  And I've been using RAWR.    And they don't quite agree.  With all the same gear and buffs set, I'm getting different results.  My suspicion is it is based around hit/expertise and the two models treating the cost of a miss differently.<br>
<br>
Examples:<br>
RAWR claims the shapeshifter's signet is a -4.3 dps downgrade.  Voldin's claims it is -.2 dps downgrade.<br>
RAWR claims Shadowmaster's Boots are a 3 dps upgrade.  Voldin's claims it is a -.4 dps downgrade.<br>
RAWR claims Don Alejandro's Money belt is a .8 dps upgrade.  Voldin's claims it is a -1.8 dps downgrade<br>
RAWR claims Belt of One-Hundred Deaths is a 2.1 dps upgrade.  Voldin's claims it is a 4.9 dps upgrade.<br>
<br>
<br>
So my question is, which model do people think is more accurate?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
~~~~~~~~<br>
Context:<br>
I'm a group that has just started MH.  We've killed Vashj several times and Kael twice -- loot from them is still pretty tight.  Other SSC/TK stuff is obtainable except for trinkets.  I'm looking at BT/MH loot and SSC/TK loot to try to figure out my best in class gear -- as epic gems are only being issued for best in class gear.  Since we are on a DKP system (seperate for each tier), I'm also interested in figuring out what my optimal purchases are.  With the transition to BT/MH, I'm also now rostered as a DPS since we only need 3 tanks and none of the 3 prot warriors are willing/able to go DPS, so tuning for DPS has become more important.<br>
<br>
Current Gear:  <br>
(all +8 agi gems except for 2 +agi/+hit, +5str/+4agi, and +4agi/+6sta gems, all enchanted)<br>
Head	Stag-Helm of Malorne<br>
Neck	Mithril Chain of Heroism<br>
Shoulders	Mantle of Malorne<br>
Chest	Vengeful Gladiator's Dragonhide Tunic<br>
Waist	Belt of Deep Shadow<br>
Legs	Skulker's Greaves<br>
Feet	Nyn'jah's Tabi Boots<br>
Wrist	Vindicator's Dragonhide Bracers<br>

</div>I won't go into details, since EJ's policy about PTR raid discussion still applies, but basically on Kalecgos, there's a situation where you WILL take a ~10500 instant spike in one attack which also stuns you, guaranteeing you'll be hit for 1-2 more 4.5k melee attacks. (This is at capped armor).<br>
<br>
Likewise on Brutallus, you can very well get hit for 5k + 2.5k + 5k + 2.5k in the space of under two seconds, very frequently. That's survivable (naturally :P) but if he does it right after a Stomp, which is guaranteed to land, deals ~5k and <b>reduces your armor by half</b> that shit can hurt... a LOT.<br>
<br>
My gear on live was for maximum threat since we were looking at clearing BT/Hyjal as fast as possible each week. After the first night on PTR, I regemmed 15sta's over all the 5agi/5hit and 10agi's (and died a little inside), reenchanted helms, shoulders, pants for max mitigation tanking, and swapped a few pieces around to maximize the amount of armor/stam/dodge I could squeeze out of being just over crit immunity. The difference between 21.5k hp raid buffed and 25k raid buffed on both those fights was like night and day. It's like Blizzard balanced around the higher number consciously. (This is as they are most recently tuned on PTR, to be fair - things can change before they go live)<br>
<br>
Both fights have all tanks sharing the MT role - and as a gearcheck they really push hard against the weak links in a raid's tank lineup.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

And yes, the fights will blow up avoidance tanks.

				<div style="font-style:italic">I won't go into details, since EJ's policy about PTR raid discussion still applies, but basically on Kalecgos, there's a situation where you WILL take a ~10500 instant spike in one attack which also stuns you, guaranteeing you'll be hit for 1-2 more 4.5k melee attacks. (This is at capped armor).<br>
<br>
Likewise on Brutallus, you can very well get hit for 5k + 2.5k + 5k + 2.5k in the space of under two seconds, very frequently. That's survivable (naturally :P) but if he does it right after a Stomp, which is guaranteed to land, deals ~5k and <b>reduces your armor by half</b> that shit can hurt... a LOT.<br>
<br>
My gear on live was for maximum threat since we were looking at clearing BT/Hyjal as fast as possible each week. After the first night on PTR, I regemmed 15sta's over all the 5agi/5hit and 10agi's (and died a little inside), reenchanted helms, shoulders, pants for max mitigation tanking, and swapped a few pieces around to maximize the amount of armor/stam/dodge I could squeeze out of being just over crit immunity. The difference between 21.5k hp raid buffed and 25k raid buffed on both those fights was like night and day. It's like Blizzard balanced around the higher number consciously. (This is as they are most recently tuned on PTR, to be fair - things can change before they go live)<br>
<br>
Both fights have all tanks sharing the MT role - and as a gearcheck they really push hard against the weak links in a raid's tank lineup.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>I had the same experience on PTR, Kalecgos hits like a truck. Long story short, the boss hits hard, and the incoming damage on tank is insane. I am armor capped, and the hits came in around 4-5k physical damage on top of that I think I ate a 7.5k magical damage. You can pretty much take almost 12-13k spike damage in 2-3 seconds as you mentioned. My ideal setup for tank gear would be to aim for 24-25k health raid buffed because I don't think 20k health will cut it.<br>
<br>
I don't want to break EJ's policy on the 2.4 stuff so I won't say any thing about the bosses. Only thing I can say is having high amount of dodge is great but it won't help you on the high amount of magical damage you will be taking, lucky warriors with their 10% less damage taken.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_659968"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Both Sathrovarr and Brutallus are capable of 2-seconding any tank, Warrior or Druid alike. Right now I'm getting a 2nd feral set from BT/Hyjal and gem for pure stamina for fights such as this. Brutallus is just stupid in his version 3 form in terms of physical damage. As a Dual Wielding mob, he hits me for 8k/4k on full armor mitigation, WITHOUT the Dual Wielding miss penalty. That combined with stomp damage can 2 round any tank.<br>
<br>
In short, gemming for agility and stamina is really the way to go for me. I don't recommend stacking 10 agility unless you use the same piece to do DPS, and you don't have access to the same item for a period of time. In terms of overall mitigation, gemming pure stamina really gimps the druid's overall ability as a tank (more overall damage taken, less threat, in favor for spike damage buffer) in my opinion.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I'm currently using my T6 gloves with a 5agi/7Stamina for my Meta gem requirements and the Nyn'jah Tabi boots for the second one.. <br>
<br>
Ideally my perfect gear set will end up using all 10 Agi except for the 2 5agi/5hit for the meta socket requirements so, since the Belt and the boots Tier 6 will be used for both Tanking and DPS set, i'll be using those 2 pieces to keep my 2 blue gems and offer those two pieces maximum versatility between DPS/tanking.<br>
<br>
Most people will bitch about the belt getting back the hit rating, some won't. I see it as a god send, seeing my perfect gear set, till the end of sunwell requires the hit rating to even make use of the 4th Boss staff :S (0.6% dodge set aswell)<br>
<br>
Shard of contempt + t6 boots + Belt of one hundred deaths = 91 expertise afaik  (89 being cap)<br>

</div>The problem with Brutallus (or what it feels like to me), is that I'm not dodging nearly as much as I should (75% nontrinked, with everything else up). If he really has "expertise" to allow him to bypass at least a significant portion of dodge, then stacking stamina is not just the way to go, it is the only way to go, heh.<br>
<br>
About Kalecgos, he hits like nothing. It is Sathrovarr the Corruptor inside that gibs tanks. Corrupting strike hits for 9k as well as causing 4 second stun (dodge becomes useless at this point). I don't know if FAP works or not, but it seems to be a plausible solution here if it works.<br>
<br>
The argument I want to make is that as a main tank for fights, I can understand wanting to stack stamina. Warriors also have significant advantage to stack stamina because their tanking gear gives them a significant boost in defense, which is their best method of avoidance (as our agility stat). So all they have to do is fill up on stamina and let defense take care of the avoidance.<br>
<br>
For us, agility is the superior stat both offensively and defensively. While I don't recommend stacking purely agility, I don't really think stamina is the only way to go either. Ideally having 2 tanking sets is nice, however.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Feral aggression isn't needed. You should have at least 1 DPS warrior that's able to put up Demo shout during his free GCD. He should be doing thunderclap as well (wow, this gimps his damage so much though, might as well make him go prot)<br>
<br>
If you don't have ANY warrior, then yeah you should spec into feral aggression. But not having a warrior in the raid is beyond my imagination.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_660382"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Update for a new "best DPS list" using Rawr. Good news is that I finally found a way to get rid of 2 piece t4, heh. It's only by 9 DPS, and it requires killing Kil'jaeden. Which means those in sunwell will still be using 2p t4 until they get the T6.5 helm. Anyway, here's the list, and I'll put the old, pre-Kiljaeden items in (), if it exists<br>
<br>

<br>
*: The difference here is the presence of Gloves of Immortal Dusk: the added armor pentration here makes Signet of Primal Wrath better than Hard Khorium Band<br>
<br>
**: This one I actually don't know the reason. However Everbloom idol comes out to be &lt;1 DPS short, so you might want to stick to everbloom<br>

The new trinket from Mag Terrace is really good even after nerf and, as I approve of the earlier posts pointing out that stamina will be needed in the beginning of Sunwell, I probably will use that one.<br>

Shadowmoon is awesome because it frees up alot of defense obviously and especially so when loosing S3 bracers and Magtheridon ring to T6 and new badge ring respectively.<br>

On the other hand you loose the ohshit-usage of the old ones and I cant really decide which two to use, and want to hear some other opinions about this.

</div>I would personally use Shadowmoon and Commendation of Kael'thas. I think shadowmoon is a no-brainer, so the tossup is between Moroes and Commendation. Commendation has only 30 second cooldown, and is self-activating, not to mention the 57 stamina translate into around 800 hp in bear form feral specced, which is quite a boost.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Well then I'm lost because no matter what I do, I cant equate to the DPS you have listed. I have higher than that with your setup. Do you have the +hit listed back on the Thunderheart Waistgaurd? Do you have 74agi/47/str on the stanchion? are you using pots rather than flask? It would be helpful if you screenshotted your buff list so I could check it out. Are you using Improved FF? How often are you powershifting?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Update for a new "best DPS list" using Rawr. Good news is that I finally found a way to get rid of 2 piece t4, heh. It's only by 9 DPS, and it requires killing Kil'jaeden. Which means those in sunwell will still be using 2p t4 until they get the T6.5 helm. Anyway, here's the list, and I'll put the old, pre-Kiljaeden items in (), if it exists<br>
<br>
Helm: <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=34244" target="_blank">[Duplicitous Guise]</a> ( <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=29098" target="_blank">[Stag-Helm of Malorne]</a> )<br>

</div>Elixir of Major agility is better for my situation as a DPs<br>
<br>
35 agility x3.1= 108.5, 20 crit rating x2.2= 44, total is 152.5 AP for me<br>
<br>
Relentless assault is only 132 AP<br>

</div>This is answered earlier. If your mangle runs out before you get 4 cp, then just use an unmangled shred then pick up the correct cycle again.<br>
 <br>
You should be mangling at the start of the fight, then shredding to 4 or 5cp. Then waiting for ~75 energy (you can powershift here if your energy went below 20) to apply rip and immediately mangle. This means the most effective mangle:shred ratio &amp; your mangle should be up before the first tick of rip. Any other cycle means exactly what you are ending up with at the moment, basically doing only 3 shred : 1 mangle or even worse.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Im not questioning this cycle as its probably been verifed by numerous people, it just seems like it I lose alot of dps. Right now, Im not exactly always ripping at 4 - 5 combo points.

</div>Are you saying that there should always be one warrior with imp. demo shout, or just a warrior to use standard demo shout? Feral Aggression's going to get you 30 more AP reduction than a warrior will give without the talent, and a warrior would have to give up the rage generation of unbridled wrath. <br>
<br>
I personally would never ever consider feral aggression, but I've seen feral druids that are basically always main tanking that take feral aggression(And not savage fury) and I'm wondering if there is any justification at all where you would want the absolute highest AP reduction, without losing dps(like you would from a warrior).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>In a 12 second period you will gain 6x20 = 120 energy. This is enough for 2 shreds at base, or three if you have 6 energy from before you started the 12 second period or gained some through powershifting, OoC or 2t4. <br>
<br>
A mangle with 2 shreds should give you 4 combo points with 33+% crit. <br>
<br>
Are you using Tigers Fury at all? Powershifting wrongly so you lose energy? Anything else you might want to mention about your playstyle other than "I just start mashing buttons"? <br>
<br>
If you play it right you should never end up with less than 4 combo points when the mangle runs out, and the majority of the time should have 5.

		<div id="post_message_661428"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->How many tanks are optimal for Sunwell fights?  We made our way through T5 with 4 tanks:  2 prot warriors and 2 feral druids.  However the great healer shortage of '08 combined with the lower number of tanks required in T6 has led to this bear being converted to a tree.  Currently we are 4/5 and 6/9, and we hope to have cleared T6 before 2.4 comes out.  After reading a few of these posts, though, I was wondering if 3 tanks was enough to progress in the next raid zone or if I should still work on upgrading my tanking set in addition to catching my healing gear up as we make our way through BT.  I see the low end of the DKP pool approaching, but if it saves us pain in Sunwell it will be worth it.  I must say that it is rather refreshing to have options on loot tables as a healer.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">In a 12 second period you will gain 6x20 = 120 energy. This is enough for 2 shreds at base, or three if you have 6 energy from before you started the 12 second period or gained some through powershifting, OoC or 2t4. <br>
<br>
A mangle with 2 shreds should give you 4 combo points with 33+% crit. <br>
<br>
Are you using Tigers Fury at all? Powershifting wrongly so you lose energy? Anything else you might want to mention about your playstyle other than "I just start mashing buttons"? <br>
<br>
If you play it right you should never end up with less than 4 combo points when the mangle runs out, and the majority of the time should have 5. Wait for 80+ energy before you rip-&gt;mangle and you'll always have the base energy to mangle + 3xshred, especially with procs.</div>

</div>LOL sorry, to answer your question, I dont use tigers fury, I know that its just a waste of energy, but I do think Im powershifting wrong. With 100 energy, and the start of a boss fight, I go in, mangle/(sometimes mangle again)/Shred/Shred ---&gt; at this point after this if I have 4 combo points I'll try and get a 5th one. So i tend to go with the attack that comes up first. If Shred and mangle both come up at the same time, i'll shred, but if mangle only comes up I'll mangle to 5 combo points and then rip. I try to keep rip up as much as possible with a mangle applied.<br>
<br>
Im just trying to get more of an understanding of what Im doing wrong. Im sure Im losing out on dps because I dont always rip at 5 combo points. I try to make sure that mangle is applied first before I rip, cause an non-mangled rip is so poor. But basically your saying that I should, mangle/shred/shred ---&gt; By this point I should have 4 combo points, then i wait till I have 75-80+ energy/rip----&gt; then what?

</div>It's been pretty well explained, and it's not complicated so I'm not sure what you/we're missing here.<br>
<br>
Mangle, Shred to 4 or 5, wait for 70+ energy, Rip, Mangle, Shred to 4 or 5, wait for 70+ energy, Rip (after the old one expires--just keep Shredding if you're in excess), Mangle, Shred to 4 or 5...<br>
<br>
Powershift when your energy is less than 15 or so.<br>
<br>
Try and sneak in an FFF when you can if someone else isn't covering it.<br>
<br>
There's not a lot of leeway here. Rip should be up with Mangle at all times, Mangle should only be used immediately after a Rip to keep the debuff up (and never as an explicit source of damage), and NEVER* used if you have a Bear tank, since he'll be doing it for you.<br>

</div>In this order for uncrittable:<br>
1.) Use Ironskin Elixir (30 resil) for bosses. You dont need to be uncrittable for trash, dont worry about the cap for trival stuff.<br>
2.) Avoid the new badge ring. Stay with Mag/Kara rings, its not worth trying to make up the difference for such a small upgrade.<br>
3.) S3 bracers (19 resil) with defense enchant (12 def) is a great place to make up defense if you arent aiming for tier 6.<br>
4.) Enchant chest with 15 defense or 15 resil.<br>
5.) Use the new helm enchant (18 stam, 20 resil). Offers nearly twice the uncrittabel status compared to the Defender one.<br>
5.) Enchant cloak with 12 defense or gem for defense/resil.<br>
<br>
Hit really isn't that important, but isnt bad either. Don't gem for it (barring 5hit/5agil), but dont discount it either.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Sure a 5 cp rip does more DPS than a 4 cp rip, but the difference is quite little (ist is lot smaller than the 3cp &lt;-&gt; 4 cp difference). If I remember it right, there is just static damage added from 4 cp to 5 cp, thats why its not important to get a 5 cp rip.<br>
<br>
So if I am sitting at 4 cp waiting for the old rip to wear off, I just shred another time if there's an ooc-procc or something like this, or I have "too much" energy. I rather "secure" the 4 cp rip + mangle, rather than trying to get a 5 cp off.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Your crit and hit are entirely too low.  That's why you are loosing dps while waiting for 5, because it is taking you 1-2 more shreds than most people to get to 4 or 5.  Yes, I know, hit isn't the greatest stat but if you have 80 something +hit you will be missing quite often (Look at a WWS parse).  Lack of both is causing you to take much longer to hit 4-5 cp.<br>
<br>
Your dps gear is enchanted and gemmed in many spots for full tank, so as long as you maintain gearing that way your dps will suffer.  You have quite a few items that are eclipsed by badge items.<br>
<br>
I hope you are saving badges for the badge reward staff.  The staff from ZA runs circles around the pillar.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>You should rip <i>then</i> mangle - rip is 12 seconds and mangle is 12 seconds, and the mangle buff applies to ticks, not to the ability when you land it. If you mangle before you rip, the last tick will always miss out on the mangle buff unless you mangled again in between.<br>
<br>
The points others have made stand - more crit, more hit, better gear in general, maybe even some expertise (shapeshifters signet is not a bad item, for example. It's not great, but it's good for hit). Idol of terror is good if you need more crit as an easy thing to get.<br>
<br>
As an example, your stats are 1170/23.52%/87 hit.<br>
Mine are ~1345/~31.57%/142 hit. (taken off MotW)<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">LOL sorry, to answer your question, I dont use tigers fury, I know that its just a waste of energy, but I do think Im powershifting wrong. With 100 energy, and the start of a boss fight, I go in, mangle/(sometimes mangle again)/Shred/Shred ---&gt; at this point after this if I have 4 combo points I'll try and get a 5th one. <b>So i tend to go with the attack that comes up first. If Shred and mangle both come up at the same time, i'll shred, but if mangle only comes up I'll mangle to 5 combo points and then rip</b>.

</div>In addition to what others have mentioned already, I've highlighted another part of what you're doing which is not helping you.  If you're a button masher, and don't see a way of breaking that habbit, you need to switch to only mashing Shred.<br>
<br>
Once you have 4-5cps, wait for 80 energy, Rip &gt;&gt;&gt; Mangle &gt;&gt;&gt; mash Shred ONLY, until you hit 4-5cps again.  Even if you find yourself with enough energy to Mangle but not Shred, it's better to wait for the next energy tick and get a Shred in, or just stop mashing at 4cps and build up that 80 energy to start your cycle again.  If you're using more than 1 Mangle per cycle you're probably not doing your top DPS.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>One thing about this is you can't take armoury caster form stats as being accurate in regards to crit due to using the weaponskill of whatever weapon you have equipped. Shrea only has 308 staff skill vs 349ish for Dukes.  That being said, it's only a bit less than 2% crit, so even at 25% crit Shrea is sitting rather low.  As a comparison point I'm sitting at 1292/32.07/121 hit with Don Alejandro's being the only piece of gear from Hyjal/BT.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Your crit and hit are entirely too low.  That's why you are loosing dps while waiting for 5, because it is taking you 1-2 more shreds than most people to get to 4 or 5.  Yes, I know, hit isn't the greatest stat but if you have 80 something +hit you will be missing quite often (Look at a WWS parse).  Lack of both is causing you to take much longer to hit 4-5 cp.<br>
<br>
Your dps gear is enchanted and gemmed in many spots for full tank, so as long as you maintain gearing that way your dps will suffer.  You have quite a few items that are eclipsed by badge items.<br>
<br>
I hope you are saving badges for the badge reward staff.  The staff from ZA runs circles around the pillar.</div>

</div>So as you can see, my dps stats are a little on the low side. In cat form my crit jumps to 33.6%/3378/87 hit which in my opinion should be higher. Are there a few gear suggestions or gem changes that I can make to raise these stats until said gear drops. Ive tried some of the programs found on druid wiki but the spreadsheets are a little confusing and a little outdated.<br>
<br>
I believe with my new knowledge of the dps cycle/powershifting and gear improvements I'll be able to make a greater contribution to my raid.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

For DPS trinkets my ideal set up in 2.3 would be DST (got mine last night in a pug raid finally!) and Madness of the Betrayer which I don't have. I probably won't get it either, as 2.4 brings the <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=34472" target="_blank">[Shard of Contempt]</a> which is crazy good for a 5 man drop, and I'll roll with that and DST in 2.4.<br>
<br>
A very rough guide to trinkets would go something like:<br>
1.<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28830" target="_blank">[Dragonspine Trophy]</a><br>
2.<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32505" target="_blank">[Madness of the Betrayer]</a><br>
2.5 <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33831" target="_blank">[Berserker's Call]</a>  (thanks CD)<br>
3.<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30627" target="_blank">[Tsunami Talisman]</a><br>
4.<a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28034" target="_blank">[Hourglass of the Unraveller]</a><br>
5.<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=29383" target="_blank">[Bloodlust Brooch]</a><br>
6.<a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32654" target="_blank">[Crystalforged Trinket]</a><br>
<br>
Obviously 4-6 are very easy to obtain so if you don't have them I'd start there. I always preferred 6 over 5 but most people seem to prefer the other way round so thats how I listed it. Come 2.4 I'd slot <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=34472" target="_blank">[Shard of Contempt]</a> between DST and madness.<br>
<br>
Its tough to say as you're in your tank gear logged out now and I didn't see what you had in DPS gear earlier.<br>
<br>
By the way your tank gear seems to be 5 defense under the crit cap.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Was playing around a bit with RAWR and come to think about tank trinket usage in 2.4. I always liked the ohshit-possibilites in Badge + Moroes but I of course also picked up Shadowmoon.<br>
<br>
The new trinket from Mag Terrace is really good even after nerf and, as I approve of the earlier posts pointing out that stamina will be needed in the beginning of Sunwell, I probably will use that one.<br>
<br>
Shadowmoon is awesome because it frees up alot of defense obviously and especially so when loosing S3 bracers and Magtheridon ring to T6 and new badge ring respectively.<br>
<br>
On the other hand you loose the ohshit-usage of the old ones and I cant really decide which two to use, and want to hear some other opinions about this. Of course there are different trinkets for different situations but what would you use for your general tanking set, say for example on Kalecgos and Brutallus?</div>

I probably won't get it either, as 2.4 brings the <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=34472" target="_blank">[Shard of Contempt]</a> which is crazy good for a 5 man drop, and I'll roll with that and DST in 2.4.<br>
<br>
A very rough guide to trinkets would go something like:<br>
1.<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28830" target="_blank">[Dragonspine Trophy]</a><br>
2.<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32505" target="_blank">[Madness of the Betrayer]</a><br>
3.<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30627" target="_blank">[Tsunami Talisman]</a><br>
4.<a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28034" target="_blank">[Hourglass of the Unraveller]</a><br>
5.<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=29383" target="_blank">[Bloodlust Brooch]</a><br>
6.<a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32654" target="_blank">[Crystalforged Trinket]</a><br>
<br>
Obviously 4-6 are very easy to obtain so if you don't have them I'd start there. I always preferred 6 over 5 but most people seem to prefer the other way round so thats how I listed it. Come 2.4 I'd slot <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=34472" target="_blank">[Shard of Contempt]</a> between DST and madness.<br>
<br>
Its tough to say as you're in your tank gear logged out now and I didn't see what you had in DPS gear earlier.<br>
<br>
By the way your tank gear seems to be 5 defense under the crit cap.</div>

</div>First about the tank gear, I logged off after getting my Pepe's enchanted, I was doing some enchant testing. I have Sillk's Cloak in the bag. I use that mostly. More armor, a lil less stam, but defense and dodge. Pepe's is good if its like single target boss fights. I might even use it for tanking Flames of Azzinoth, but thats off topic.<br>
<br>
With the list you written, items 4-6 are easyily obtainable. Fact is I have two of them already. I was using Bladefistbreadth, and the Ashtounge Talisman. The proc is really high on it from the testing Ive done. But I know now that I wont be using mangle as much so thats going to go in the bank. The dps gear is well, alot of my tanking set, the only thing different I would say are the rings, neck, and cloak, which are:<br>
<br>
1. <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32266" target="_blank">[Ring of Deceitful Intent]</a><br>
2. <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=29301" target="_blank">[Band of the Eternal Champion]</a><br>
3. <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28745" target="_blank">[Mithril Chain of Heroism]</a><br>
4. <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28529" target="_blank">[Royal Cloak of Arathi Kings]</a><br>
<br>
And then for my weapon and idol Im using <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30883" target="_blank">[Pillar of Ferocity]</a> and <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=29390" target="_blank">[Everbloom Idol]</a>. My thing is, from the numerous post on here that I've read, Ive got items that are geared towards dps, but on the list of top dps items, there on the low end. That coupled with the fact that Ive been doing my dps cycle wrong, it can diffently show that Im not putting out as much as I can. Even if I did have the items I have, but I was doing the dps cycle/poweshifting correctly it might not be as bad. Hopefully with the help here, I will see a definate increase on my guilds WWS pages.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Whoops!  Thanks for that catch.  I was picturing it in my head, and remembered the 35 was the important number, but that was because of Mangle, not the Rip.  <br>
<br>
Also, for those wanting to up their DPS, an energy tic mod is extremely useful for timing Rip-&gt;Mangle cycles.  I believe there's one built in to Xperl, and there are a number of stand-alone ones floating around the UI sites.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_662617"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->@Shrea: Your rings are great for DPS. <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33496" target="_blank">[Signet of Primal Wrath]</a> is another excellent druid ring from ZA.<br>
<br>
Cloak and neck could do with an upgrade. For cloak look to <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32323" target="_blank">[Shadowmoon Destroyer's Drape]</a> or <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=29994" target="_blank">[Thalassian Wildercloak]</a>.<br>
<br>
For neck I'm not too sure. I'd be tempted to get Supremus neck if you could, or Kaels neck. Failing that I think the heroic dps neck and the other kara neck (worgen claw or something) rank in better than the one you have.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
@Sunwell gear<br>
<br>
I was taking my first proper look at the new Sunwell gear today. Mainly I was looking at potential upgrades and a possible set combining 4 pieces of T6 and some of the new ones. Quick listing of my conclusions.<br>
<br>
<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=34392" target="_blank">[Demontooth Shoulderpads]</a>: Incredibly marginal upgrade from T6 mitigation wise. What it does shine at is a lot more threat geneartion. The inclusion of sensible sockets also allows some mix of 15 stam, 10 agi and 5agi/7stam gems to get the bonus 3 agi which is really worth it.<br>
<br>
<a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=1" target="_blank">[Item 'mask of the furry hunter' not found!]</a>: Nice upgrade. 11 agility and 15 stamina over T6 is a solid upgrade and the crit rating more than makes up for the loss of a little ap. Again, good socket colour and bonus allows a 5agi/7stam gem to effectively become a 5agi/13 stam gem. Or a 10 agi gem to 10agi/6stam.<br>
<br>
<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=34408" target="_blank">[Gloves of the Forest Drifter]</a>: This is a strong upgrade from T6. Loss of 5 strength is made up for tenfold with 2 extra agility, 11 extra stam and a whole extra socket as well as having armour penetration. Socketed for 10agility+5agi/7stam these gloves make excellent DPS gloves as well. The extra socket is the big selling point over T6 though as it allows a lot more stats. <br>
<br>
<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=34211" target="_blank">[Harness of Carnal Instinct]</a>: This ones an oddity, one of the two new pieces that has less rather than equal armour to its T6 equiv. Giving up that 54 armour and a little strength nets you 8 agility, 13 stamina, some armour penetration and an amazing socket bonus (4 agi). The yellow socket could be a little tricky to acheive the bonus but its a good place to stick a defense/resilience gem if you're still lacking in the new patch (after losing ring defnense for the new heroic ring). Its not such a huge upgrade as I'd like to see though to be honest from a chest item.<br>
<br>
<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=34385" target="_blank">[Leggings of the Immortal Beast]</a>: I'm loathe to lose the massive amount of +hit on the T6 leggings. But the two extra sockets on this item make it a no brainer. A large chunk more stam, a little extra agility and another armour penetration stat. May need to make the hit up somewhere else though, or possibly through in a couple of 5agi/5hits into the odd yellow socket that appears (like on chest).<br>
<br>
<br>
So for the bonus I would probably use:<br>
<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=34556" target="_blank">[Thunderheart Waistguard]</a>: Makes up for the majority of hit lost on T6 legs. Concerned about the lower armour and loss of a socket though. Deeper theorycrafting may turn up that the loss here is worth less than keeping a T6 elsewhere and natural power here. I'll look into it when I have more time. <br>
<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=34573" target="_blank">[Thunderheart Treads]</a>: Very solid upgrade over den mother. Expertise is also great.<br>
<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=34444" target="_blank">[Thunderheart Wristguards]</a>: Nice enough for what it is. New helm enchant should go a fair way to making up lost resilience from the PvP bracers most use.<br>
<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=31048" target="_blank">[Thunderheart Pauldrons]</a>: As I said above, the demon tooth shoulders are a tiny upgrade mitigation wise for these shoulders. Their threat generation stats are nice but unlikely to outweigh the Swipe bonus, especially with all the crit and armour pen helping swipe threat far more than with lacerate, even after the AP scaling.<br>
<br>
For the other 4 slots I'd use the gear above. That gear has 0 resilience and 0 defense.<br>
<br>
EDIT: Rushing out of work but my math actually looked wrong here, will recheck when I get home.<br>
<br>
So to reach crit immunity:<br>
Neck: <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=34178" target="_blank">[Collar of the Pit Lord]</a><br>
Cloak: <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33593" target="_blank">[Slikk's Cloak of Placation]</a><br>
Ring: <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=29279" target="_blank">[Violet Signet of the Great Protector]</a><br>
(2nd ring I'd use the new badge one which has no defense).<br>
<br>
<br>
That leaves us requiring 97 defense or 64 resilience, or any mixture of.<br>
<a class="q2" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=29193" target="_blank">[Glyph of the Gladiator]</a> = 20 res<br>
<a class="q1" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=35430" target="_blank">[Enchant Chest - Major Resilience]</a> = 15 res<br>
<br>
Thats the two resilience enchants which knocks the total needed down to 29 resilience or 44 defense if my math is right.<br>
<a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=35756" target="_blank">[Formula: Enchant Cloak - Steelweave]</a> = 12 def<br>
<a class="q1" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=35422" target="_blank">[Enchant Bracer - Major Defense]</a> = 12 def<br>
<a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28911" target="_blank">[Greater Inscription of the Knight]</a> = 15 def<br>
<br>
Which leaves us wanting for 5 defense rating. A single <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32223" target="_blank">[Enduring Seaspray Emerald]</a> in any of the multitude of yellow or blue slots on the gear will hit the nail bang on the head for defense. The rest of the slots will go to the new badge ring, the new heroic trinket and Badge of Tenacity.<br>
<br>
The only unfortunate thing about this build is it leaves us slightly short of the armour cap, about 800 (675 with terror proc).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_662779"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Hi All,<br>
<br>
New to the forums as a registered user but a long time reader of the thread. I'm looking for some feedback for my situation on how to defend feral druids and their viability in raids.<br>
<br>
Currently I'm in a guild that has cleared TBC content to date and we use 2 prot warriors + 1 prot pally as our tanks. For situations that require an additional tank we have one of our dps warriors respec. That being said we do not have any feral druids in our raid. Our GM is a firm believer that feral druids are not viable in raids as there are better options. Since we have 3 tanks already he doesn't feel a feral tank is required. For dps, he would prefer to roll with an extra hunter or rogue vs a cat because they are better dps output.<br>
<br>
I currently raid as a resto druid but I'd like to give it a go as feral in 25 mans. I already have a half decent bear/cat set (mix of gear from ssc/tk/hyjal/bt) which can easily be upgraded as we are finished content and loot is rotting. But I am having difficulty convincing my GM that a feral druid would be useful (in our situation) and not gimp/slow down the raid.<br>
<br>
Anyone have any thoughts?<br>
<br>
On a side note, throughout the thread I've seen a lot of theoretical dps (via Rawr) but I rarely see many actual dps reports. It would be helpful if people could come forward with their cat experiences and discuss what kind of dps they are actually hitting in 25 mans. <br>
<br>
Thanks in advance for responses and thanks to all the contributors.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I've got it and I use it on trash but I simply couldn't give up such a huge chunk of armour for a little hit when tanking anything substantial.<br>
<br>
<br>
Just tested and removing the Karazhan ring in bear form causes me to drop 2156 armour. That just isn't an acceptable loss for a little hit. Gemming a few agility/hit pyrestones is a much better route to go if you feel lacking.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Hi All,<br>
<br>
New to the forums as a registered user but a long time reader of the thread. I'm looking for some feedback for my situation on how to defend feral druids and their viability in raids.<br>
<br>
Currently I'm in a guild that has cleared TBC content to date and we use 2 prot warriors + 1 prot pally as our tanks. For situations that require an additional tank we have one of our dps warriors respec. That being said we do not have any feral druids in our raid. Our GM is a firm believer that feral druids are not viable in raids as there are better options. Since we have 3 tanks already he doesn't feel a feral tank is required. For dps, he would prefer to roll with an extra hunter or rogue vs a cat because they are better dps output.<br>
<br>
I currently raid as a resto druid but I'd like to give it a go as feral in 25 mans. I already have a half decent bear/cat set (mix of gear from ssc/tk/hyjal/bt) which can easily be upgraded as we are finished content and loot is rotting. But I am having difficulty convincing my GM that a feral druid would be useful (in our situation) and not gimp/slow down the raid.<br>
<br>
Anyone have any thoughts?<br>
<br>
On a side note, throughout the thread I've seen a lot of theoretical dps (via Rawr) but I rarely see many actual dps reports. It would be helpful if people could come forward with their cat experiences and discuss what kind of dps they are actually hitting in 25 mans. <br>
<br>
Thanks in advance for responses and thanks to all the contributors.</div>

</div>Find a new guild ... seriously.  Gear up and xfer.<br>
<br>
No matter what you do it is only going to reinforce your GMs idiocy.  You'll be doing something for the first time in substandard gear, compare this to your established tanks which are experienced and well geared.  There is no way that you can overcome your GMs prejudice in this situation.<br>
<br>
Post 2258 has a good druid DPS WWS.  The point to druid DPS is that it increases all other physical dps, while putting out respectable numbers on its own.  +5% crit is pretty sweet for rogues, hunters, enhance shamans, etc - and the +4% heal on a crit is a useful side effect.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Seriously, if your GM doesn't believe the math, why don't you show him the WWS reports of top guilds on dps dependant encounters ? Pretty much all of them use ferals, enchancement shaman and some even retribution paladins.<br>
<br>
The view of hybrid / supporterclasses being not viable or suboptimal in raids is outdated by almost a year.<br>

		<div id="post_message_662977"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->With the extremely high cost of the badge gear from 2.4, I've got really think about what pieces are worth getting over other choices.  So I'm hoping for some help from you guys here, since I'm not very good at figuring out quality choices with Rawr/Toskk.<br>
<br>
My DPS set takes a back seat to my tanking set, so my first 260 badges (of which I've already collected 125) will be going to the badge pants, chest, and ring for tanking (I got T6 gloves, the first T6 in my guild, last week, so I don't need the badge gloves).  After that, I'm looking at getting the badge staff to upgrade over my S2 mace.  After that, though... I'm not sure how best to upgrade myself with the readily available new gear in 2.4.  <br>
<br>
I expect my guild will be running Sunwell, but I think we'll have a hard time downing Brutalis until we've gotten a lot more BT/Hyjal progression and farming time (we're currently 4/5 and 4/9).  So that leaves me with a small hope of getting T6 bracers in a reasonable time frame, and the badge loot and crafted gear to act as a transitional set while we work on progression in BT/Sunwell.<br>
<br>
So the question becomes: should I gather badges for the dps gear, or gather mats for the crafted dps gear, or both?  Which pieces of DPS badge gear are good upgrades over t5-ish loot?  The only T6-level DPS gear I have is my T6 gloves (which have a 15 stam gem in them, and are enchanted for agi) and the bracers off Teron (from our one kill of him so far).  I'm at work atm, or I'd go log out in my DPS set so Armory would update accordingly.  I'll do that after I get home.<br>
<br>
In the meantime, my DPS set, from my best recollection, is as follows:<br>
T4 Helm<br>
Wargen Claw Necklace<br>
T4 Shoulders<br>
S3 Chest<br>
Insidious Bands<br>
Gloves of the Searing Grip<br>
Waistguard of the Great Beast<br>
Leggings of Murderous Intent<br>
Nyn'ja's Tabi Boots<br>
Honored Hyjal DPS ring<br>
Ancestral Ring of Conquest<br>
Hourglass of the Unraveler<br>
Bloodlust Brooch<br>
S3 Mace<br>
Everbloom Idol<br>
<br>
In terms of the 2t4 bonus, I don't have the t4 chest (though with the Mag changes in 2.4, I may have some glimmer of hope at getting it after all, if it's worth worrying about any more), but I have the rest, and soon none of it is going to require tanking enchants. Which 2 pieces should I retain for my DPS set at this lvl of gear?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I can finally socket my gear with those coveted +10 agi gems.  The caster monopoly over spinels in my guild is finally over!<br>

it will be really nice because with the way the Sunwell loot looks, we'll be playing gem swap constantly to try to keep our hit rate/defense etc up while we go from peice to peice.  Will be nice to be able to resocket the epic gems and not feel guilty about it.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Looking at Rawr even when getting the Kil'jaeden helm the difference is so minimal from 2pc T4 that I'll probably just let the rogues grab helms first and just hope I get one before WotLK release.

</div>Well, you already said that when an extra tank is needed, you have a dps warrior respec. That's less useful than a feral druid, who with one spec, within an instance without having to leave, is always available to be a tank or dps. Moreover, if you gear for it, you can be pretty good dps and a pretty good off-tank with a mid-combat role swap.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I'd be curious to see some WWSs from your raids.  How much do the rogues lose out not having Mangle?<br>
<br>
I just asked our Rogues, what I'm hearing is about 20 dps per Rogue from Mangle alone, and about 60-70 dps for 5% crit, based on their gear and the spreadsheet from the Rogue thread here.  Since you'd still have an Enhancement Shaman and Warrior in the group, who wouldn't get the benefit from Mangle, but probably would gain at least as much from LotP, if not more due to the extra Rage generation, you can probably assume at least 70ish dps gained per person.  So a Druid would need to be doing about 300 less dps than Rogues to not be worthwhile.  If I'm in a random leftovers group, that's the case, if I'm in a group with Battle Shout and a twisting Enhancement Shaman, I'm within 100 dps.  While this is just napkin math, I'm not sure what math your GM is using.  This discounts the (nontrivial) healing from iLotP as well.<br>
<br>
It's sort of strange to me to think about doing all that content without a Feral tank, at least as an option.  We don't use a protection Pally, but we just haven't found a competent one, it's not because our raid leader or GM thinks they're worthless.  Even if a Druid + LotP for four other melee and Mangle for Rupture doesn't beat out Hunter or Rogue dps, an extra Innervate and Rebirth should also count for something.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Post 2258 has a good druid DPS WWS.  The point to druid DPS is that it increases all other physical dps, while putting out respectable numbers on its own.  +5% crit is pretty sweet for rogues, hunters, enhance shamans, etc - and the +4% heal on a crit is a useful side effect.</div>

Pretty much what he said, sounds like your GM is an idiot and seriously needs a clue. Feral dps and tanking is fine, almost every BT/MH guild has 1-2 ferals and they do just fine. If you wana raid as feral then you should find a new guild.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

3. A feral can be a tank or a DPSer in the same raid with the same spec.  This is the kicker: take a fight like Naj'entus as an example.  You only need 1 tank.  If you bring 3 pure tanks to a raid, or as you said, have a fury warrior spec tank and actually bring <b>four</b> pure tanks... ouch.  That's 3 off tanks putting out very low DPS on the fight.<br>
<br>
Now swap out 2 of those pure tanks for 2 feral druids: you just gained a <b>ton</b> of raid DPS on a one-tank fight, while still having 4 top-notch tanks available for every other encounter in the raid.<br>

</div>Arguments can be made about our personal DPS + Buff (a good rogue instead of the druid would be better RDPS for instance) But this last part really sums up the power of the Feral druid.  Unless you are a guild that swaps for maximum efficiency every fight, bringing those "Required for Trash and 4 bosses" OTs just kills your RDPS if they aren't ferals.  Prot warriors and Pallies are good tanks, I wish my guild had one of the latter for pesky Hyjal (we run 2 prot warriors + 2 feral + 2 dps warriors at times, depending on the fight/attendance) but their DPS is abysmal.  I'm sure that prot warrior doing 1.6k dps is using warglaives and other top end gear, chain drums/bl on a fight like akama or reliquary where there's a +% damage buff, meanwhile we have Antarin doing 2.5k dps on Kaz'rogal (did you resist every stun?! christ)<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I haven't been able to make the link work yet, but yes, that prot warrior is almost certain to be doing 1.6k dps on Teron, who has virtually no armour. Plus ferals have been tracked doing well over 2k dps on that fight, so it's pretty silly to pick one data point and try to make an argument for prot warriors. We have 3 in the guild, although we'd never run with more than 2, and we'd definitely use another feral if a top quality one came along.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_663730"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->To be fair I had a couple unholy frenzy buffs during that 2500 Kaz'rogal.  A fully decked out prot warrior with an ideal group can indeed put up 1800 dps.  While that may sound impressive, a fully decked out druid in an ideal group can put up 2100+ and bring lotp (which by itself can be up to 500dps).  Is either scenario really applicable though?  At least it's far more likely that your prot warriors will get their ideal set of gear since blizzard loves to itemize for warriors.<br>

I have assembled everything on this list except for the pants (which I've de'd hundreds of times, sigh).  However, when I plug it all into Rawr it gives me 12.633% miss and 86.4% to dodge with every single buff activated (except idol which is off).  This post: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080409231217/http://elitistjerks.com/636595-post1841.html" target="_blank">http://elitistjerks.com/636595-post1841.html</a> somehow works out to be 12.88% miss + 95% dodge with very similar gear.  I'm down about 30 agi from not having sunwell loots and no night elf racial, but those aren't anywhere near 10% dodge.<br>
If I exchange the tunic for the crafted one with 4 more agi, the cloak with the 33agi version (+2) and added 1 agi from shahraz boots, and add 10 agi from <a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?spell=31026" target="_blank">Embrace of the Dawn - Spells - World of Warcraft</a> I hit 100.2% dodge+miss.  Is this right?  It seems significantly harder then all the posts floating around saying 106%+ are possible without idol.<br>

While having a protadin reduces even the ferals to mostly dps on trash (ours tanks entire waves in MH, we don't even bother taunting off, our new MT was laughed at when he tried to taunt an Abo  and almost died in the process of healers being shocked by someone other than dps-ers taking dmg).<br>
Ferals make great tanks for any fight that doesn't require spell reflect and maybe isn't a first kill (LS/SW are so good for those that a warrior MT is great) and even on those bosses that can't crush are quite common and make Feral tank a very nice thing to use (Azgalor, Archimonde).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Well, it's not like we don't use hybrid classes to buff our DPS, for example we do use 5 shammies (2 enhance for 2 melee groups, 1 elemental for caster group, 2 resto) But his argument is that the buff provided by feral druids does not outweigh the straightup dps that is produced by an additional rogue/hunter based on our setup.<br>

Is there anything that would support otherwise that I could read up on?</div>

</div>First issue is: a geared feral is a perfectly reasonable 4th tank.  If your GM doesn't understand this, track down WWS parses of ferals tanking Anetheron/Shahraz/Archi/etc and show them how effective ferals can be in terms of average/max hits taken.  <br>
 <br>
Second issue: Don't forget Feral Faerie Fire. <br>
<br>
I assume if you don't have a feral for raid-optimization purposes, then you certainly don't have a moonkin.  And resto druids need to shift out of tree to put up Faerie Fire, so most likely, if you don't have a feral it isn't up.  Checking Toskk's real quick, I get a 30 DPS difference between keeping it up and not, for a T4-geared druid.  It'll only be better from there.  <br>
 <br>
So your raid buffs are: <br>
(Faerie Fire):610 armor penetration to every melee in the raid-- at least 30 DPS x 7-9, or about 250 raid DPS<br>
5%-6% (depending on idol use) crit rating for your group (typically around 80-100 DPS for every melee), so somewhere around 300-400 raid DPS.<br>
Mangle for all bleeds (a 30% buff to each rogue's ruptures, which is 10% of their DPS, assume DPS around 1500, then rogues get .3 * .1 * 1500 = 45 DPS), plus bonuses to deep wounds for DPS warriors.  This could be a 150 raid DPS buff or more.<br>
Healing to your group (won't save a life most likely, but will save the healers mana; would you ever NOT spend 2 talent points on it?)<br>
An extra battle res in the raid-- if a DPS class dies early because of stupidity/lag/"bad luck", you can res them.  At that point, you can essentially claim all their DPS post-death as DPS which the raid wouldn't have had if you weren't there.  Even if you're doing the res instead of a tree, it just means that the heals on tanks don't get interrupted.<br>
 <br>
From the above-- you'll be bringing around 800 raid DPS that's not on your personal meter by being in the melee group, before you res someone, and not counting healing for your group.  Probably 600-700 DPS in a hunter group, and possibly 500 + more threat + minimal healing in the tank group.  Even if you're in a hunter group, their LOTP DPS is increased even more by not having to Mend Pet as much; you're also increasing time on a survival hunter's on-crit buffs, if you have one.<br>
 <br>
I don't know a gear level where the first feral druid is being out-DPSed by 800 by anyone except mages/locks on AOE (having just started full clears of Hyjal/BT, I tend to be only 200-300 DPS behind our rogues; you could argue the DPS they beat me by is almost all DPS from the buffs I give them; no warglaives yet, though).  <br>
 <br>
Plus, the feral can tank.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I have assembled everything on this list except for the pants (which I've de'd hundreds of times, sigh).  However, when I plug it all into Rawr it gives me 12.633% miss and 86.4% to dodge with every single buff activated (except idol which is off).  This post: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080409231217/http://elitistjerks.com/636595-post1841.html" target="_blank">http://elitistjerks.com/636595-post1841.html</a> somehow works out to be 12.88% miss + 95% dodge with very similar gear.  I'm down about 30 agi from not having sunwell loots and no night elf racial, but those aren't anywhere near 10% dodge.<br>
If I exchange the tunic for the crafted one with 4 more agi, the cloak with the 33agi version (+2) and added 1 agi from shahraz boots, and add 10 agi from <a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?spell=31026" target="_blank">Embrace of the Dawn - Spells - World of Warcraft</a> I hit 100.2% dodge+miss.  Is this right?  It seems significantly harder then all the posts floating around saying 106%+ are possible without idol.<br>

		<div id="post_message_664630"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I'm curious to see what other's opinions are for feral pvp itemization if the proposed change to NI goes through (assume <i>50/100%</i> of agi to healing, 10/20% of ap to healing received in kitty(and caster?). I realize other numbers have appeared on the PTR tooltip but lets assume those for now. Although I'm using myself as an example the overall point/question is more general in nature. I currently have around 500agi and 3000ap in pvp gear (so +500 healing and +600 to getting healed) and my resilience is only around 220.<br>
<br>
I'm far from a hardcore pvp'r (just do casual 2s and 3s) but would like to improve and perhaps make more of an effort. Right now my pvp gear isn't so hot as you'd expect from someone who only got in the arena game a couple weeks into s3. I have s1 in 3 slots and the s3 bp (prioritized this for pve purposes). I am currently using the deathblow goggles for my helm and I have about 2000 arena points saved up...which helm should I get or how should I spend them? <br>
<br>
Relative to my deathblow goggles (+48 to healing before gems) I could get the S3 helm and have improved survivability, similar offense/burst and +31 to healing (net -17). Or I could get the S2 helm for cheaper and have improved survivability, less offense/burst (although not horrible) and +78 healing(!) (net +30). Is s2 gear more valuable again? I am no longer sure how to evaluate the tradeoffs now that feral healing is somewhat viable. Item budget (ilevel) doesn't seem to really help since we can now add agi to healing and that basically gives us 'free' item points we did not have before (ignoring current NI). What is a new pvp'r to do?<br>
<br>
This doesn't even address the fact that the 2.4 engineering goggles will have 61 agi (+61 healing!) before gems. How do we weigh that against the added survivability of the existing pvp helms? I see similar hard decision in other slots as well. Weapon for example...badge staff with much higher dps and 52 agi or s2/3 weapon with zero agility?<br>
<br>
<b>How 'valuable' has agi become now relative to other pvp stats?</b><br>
<br>
That said, work blocks the wow forums (and many other gaming related sites) so I apologize if there has been a definitive change to the PTR NI again since I last checked.<br>

</div>My understanding (haven't checked PTRs personally but have been following developments fairly closely) is that NI has been changed for a while now to 100% agility as + healing and a 20% bonus to healing done to you in Cat form. At present this 20% bonus also seems to apply in caster form as well, whether that's a bug or not though isn't clear.<br>
<br>
Edit: Just to clarify this 20% bonus to healing received is just a straight multiplier to incoming healing. Not based off agility in any way.<br>
<br>
In terms of feral PVP discussion I must admit I've been wondering whether it was worth a seperate thread in the PVP forum. I don't personally have the experience to put something together to kick things off unfortunately but trying to include a detailed PVP feral discussion in this thread which has been heavily PVE focused generally would seem a bit on the messy side.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I thought about posting this in the pvp forum but I could almost hear the crickets chirping already. I know that some pvp'rs do post here and I didn't want to create a really broad topic. It would appear that feral viability would increase with this change...might spark some more interest.

		<div id="post_message_664707"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Despite what people are trying to say otherwise, there is really no evidence to suggest that using a druid to fill a pure DPS slot is at all optimum. A good hunter, warlock or rogue has the potential to add significantly more RDPS than a dps druid. Using wwsscoreboard for some quick comparisions, if you comparing Antarin (ranked 2 druid) to Intriken (rank 2 hunter) to Mitski (rank 2 rogue) it looks like: Antarin - 1347, Intriken - 1776, Mitski - 2846. In fact, Antarin's 2500 DPS on Kaz'Rogal is the only example of a druid cracking the top 50 for any fight in either MH or BT. Not only that, the dps drop off between positions is much greater for druids, suggesting that it is not easy to deliver this high level of DPS (requires lots of experience and a favorable setup). There are 30 rogues that average 1700dps or more, but only 15 druids that average 1000 or more. Although, this is probably also due to the fact that very few feral druids actually dps every fight.<br>
<br>
All that being said, I have a feeling in 2.4 that feral druids will become the premiere tank for trash, with protection paladins being a close second. This is actually a fairly important role as when you are doing multiple farm instances a week, how fast you can clear trash really determines how much you can accomplish. <br>
<br>
In any case, I think my main point in this post is to recommend to any feral druid trying to get a raid spot to position themselves as an offtank and make your case based on threat gen, durability, raid-wide dps buffs like mangle and FF, and the ability to quickly transition to a reasonably efficient dps'r. I would say that trying to get a pure dps slot is only for a small amount of feral druids with the experience, gear, and raid leader support to pull it off.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_664798"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->You're certainly welcome to claim that rogues do 2500 DPS rather than 1500, but that also means that instead of an 800 non-personal raid DPS benefit, it's much larger.  If you're arguing that the first feral's raid DPS contribution is lower, please explain. <br>
<br>
Also explain how you can count on the 3rd rogue or 2nd DPS warrior to have a pair of warglaives, which I'm sure all the people at the top of the charts have.  Those are the spots a feral is competing against.  If you've been farming BT for 6 months and you're lucky... you're certainly not an average-case raiding guild (or even an average-case EJ guild) which this conversation is really for.   <br>
<br>
Antarin is one of the few examples of a druid who is consistently and only a DPSer: rogues have nothing to do but set DPS records when they run out of things to do, while druids tank, heal, some even go moonkin to fill the farming boredom.  Also, name me a rogue anywhere near the top of meter that doesn't have a "favorable setup".  <br>
<br>
The lack of top 50 showings is probably because any fight a rogue excels at, a druid will individually do several hundred less.  How big is the spread between DPSer #1 and DPSer #50? <br>
<br>
Your WWS reports also don't show the average number of battle resses those druids perform on DPSers that die early, and the amount of DPS which that contributes.  <br>
<br>
Finally, once Sunwell loot starts dropping, the numbers will be changing.  The Sunwell staff alone will upgrade feral DPS by 100 (or more, depending on if the feral has an S3 staff), while there still isn't anything better than Warglaives for the rogues (that 3rd rogue might get some weapon upgrades, though).  All feral gear has at least a 3rd DPS stat, whereas the current T6 doesn't-- so we see 20-30 DPS increases in most gear slots.  <br>
<br>
You are right in that a certain degree of practice/gear is necessary for consistent DPS, but even for the purposes of only DPS when you're running 3-4 prot tanks, the first feral still brings a large contribution of raid DPS, at least on par with a non-warglaive rogue or fury warrior (or in other words, an acceptable switch for any guild that hasn't been farming T6 for 6 months).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Your comparison of 'top rogue dps' with 'top druid dps' is just wrong for so many different reasons. NO rogue is going to do 2800 dps consistently, not by a long shot - in fact, the highest dps of a rogue ever achieved on teron is 2794 according to wwsscoreboard (Mitzki has so high dps because it's average and he has several fights with 5000+ dps due to unholy frenzy in MH).<br>
<br>
From my experience, a decently equipped feral druid does about 1800 dps (decently meaning he lacks the more rare dps items he passed for in favor of rogues etc.), a perfectly geared one can reach 2000 dps.<br>
<br>
I know there are reports for druids topping 2200 dps but that is really situational and usually involves proc- and critluck or bloodlust stacking.<br>
<br>
A perfectly geared rogue does around 2400-2600 dps. Yeah you can do 2800 or even more but that effectively the same as 2200 dps ferals.<br>
<br>
So, granted they have the same gear, the difference is about 400-600 dps, add about 200 to that if the druid passed on some items - but then again, a rogue without top equip does less damage, too.<br>
<br>
So it really comes down to a difference of about 500 dps on top gear level. LotP, Mangle, FFF alone are worth about that, battlerez, innervate and tankability are just the icing on the sweet feral cake.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_664928"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Relying on a WWS of an entire run comparing a pure DPS class and a hybrid utility class is supposed to prove exactly what?  I also noticed that the top two rogues (3k+ and 2800 odd) are the exceptions whereas the rest of the pack sit at 2200 down.  I'm guessing best gear setup possible + best group setup but using them as the rule for comparison is deceptive.<br>
<br>
If the raid leader doesn't believe a feral druid would be useful, *shrug* you are stuck.  That doesn't change the fact that they are useful on many levels, do supplement a significant amount of DPS if in a well setup group and give you a lot more tactical flexibility.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Call me suspicious, but are YOU the GM who's against Ferals? You seem to be arguing the point here digging up some WWS exception rather than the rule report to prove something. I mean seriously this discussion is old and has been regurgitated so many times. If someone can read this thread and still not understand what a Feral brings to a raid then they do not deserve to be in charge of it.</div>

		<div id="post_message_665039"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->This argument is old and done.  A guild that's using more than 2 Prot Pally + Prot Warrior isn't getting his money's worth.  A Feral Druid is worth it in a raid overall (excluding we-swap-people-every-pull), they don't even have to be that good to surpass the 3rd warrior/pally in terms of value.  Any raider that hasn't realized this by now hasn't been paying enough attention to warrent being allowed to make decisions when it comes to raid makeup (likely also think Rogues/Hunter/Shaman is a good group)  Yes, a top geared fury warrior is going to do better DPS than a Feral Druid, and a top geared prot warrior is going to be a better tank on many fights, but having the Fury tank or the Prot DPS is just stupid.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">So your raid buffs are: <br>
...<br>
Mangle for all bleeds (a 30% buff to each rogue's ruptures, which is 10% of their DPS, assume DPS around 1500, then rogues get .3 * .1 * 1500 = 45 DPS), plus bonuses to deep wounds for DPS warriors.  This could be a 150 raid DPS buff or more.<br>
...</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>I think that's being more than a little bit generous, at least on the buff to rogues.  We typically have 2 or 3 ferals in the raid, so I think it's safe to assume I get the benefit from mangle, but my rupture damage only ranges from 3-5% of my total.  So if it's 5% *after* mangle, and I'm doing 1500 DPS, mangle is only responsible for 17.3 of that.<br>
<br>
Now if I look at the last time I got to spank a boss unfettered, I did 2090 on Rage Winterchill Tuesday(yay for good luck with death and decay on ranged, suckers).  4% of that was rupture, so if all of my ruptures were boosted by mangle, I got 19.3 DPS from it.  Still a far cry from 45.<br>
<br>
Maybe if you had a sub rogue with serrated blades prioritizing rupture over SnD it would be 10% of his damage.  I dunno.<br>
<br>
LotP also doesn't give me anywhere near 100DPS.  I wanna say more like 40-50, but I haven't got a spreadsheet on hand at work to check the exact numbers.<br>
<br>
I'm not saying the buffs aren't good, and I have no problem with well-played ferals in the raid, but it seems like you're over-estimating the buffs just a touch.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
DOWNLOAD: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080409231217/https://www.codeplex.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ProjectName=Rawr&amp;ReleaseId=11411" target="_blank">https://www.codeplex.com/Release/Pro...eleaseId=11411</a></b><br>
<br>
Beta 12:<br>
* Rawr now includes models for Moonkins, Mages, and Warlocks! <br>
* Many more stats are tracked about items, for use in new and upcoming models. <br>
* Fixed a bug in the options for Cat, so that it updates the label for the value of expose weakness. <br>
* Icons now pull from the more reliable wowarmory.com instead of the old flakey armory.worldofwarcraft.com. <br>
* You can now safely run multiple copies of Rawr at the same time by duplicating Rawr's folder. Each running copy of Rawr must be in its own folder, with its own cache xml files. <br>
* Fixed some bugs that would cause Rawr to crash. <br>
* The Splash screen has finally been redone! It now has a background image, and an icon for each model that is loaded, along with the version #s of each model, Rawr's UI, and Base. <br>
* Tooltips on the calculations should really last a long time now, for everyone, I hope. <br>
* The ItemCache should save faster, load faster, and take up alot less space, per item. <br>
* There's a menu item now, to reload the character data from the Armory for the current character. <br>
* The Projectile and Projectile Bag slots will now be hidden if they don't apply to the current model. <br>
* Improved how Rawr handles requests for data from the Armory. <br>
* When unable to access the Armory will now handle it much more gracefully. If you see blank icons, anywhere, that's probably the case. <br>
* There's now an options dialog. More will come in there, but for now, there's customizable proxy settings. If you were previously unable to use Rawr due to being behind a proxy that was different from your IE settings, or required different authentication, give this a try.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_666620"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->The only disadvantage of our tank-quality gear lacking +hit/expertise is MTing bosses or heaving hitting trash (the guys before Teron are about all I can think of...).  Other than that, its relatively easy to keep 9% hit and moderate expertise (I wear 4% worth of -dodge and parry) while tanking trash.  This makes a ridiculous difference in terms of our threat generation.  <br>
<br>
Presently, I'm having a lot of fun playing with 4/5 T6 + S3 Helm + ZA Staff + S3 Bracer + Expertise Neck + Expertise Belt + Expertise Ring + Hyjal Ring + Treads of Den Mother +  Madness + Shadowmoon.  While it only rings in at about 26k armor, this is more than enough to handle any trash mob in the game and easily gives me the highest single target threat of any tank and swipe threat considerable to very well geared prot Paladin.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>
