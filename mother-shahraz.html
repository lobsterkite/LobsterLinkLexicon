850 strikes me as a little on the low side.<br>

Also, stack stam? or more spell damage. I can stack about 700 more hp but I'll lose about 80 spell damage. Worth it?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Well as a Mage I have 3 schools of possible dmg, untalented frostbolts and fireballs are subpar at best but hey its better then being below the main tank on damage. <br>
<br>
Another question... Was looking through the mess of other threads, and I notice you guys situate your raid on benches/other environment items to avoid bad teleports. Are you guys getting relatively quick repeat kills every week on her with this strat? Or is it a complete crapshoot every week Archimonde Style?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I think you still want a shadow priest or two.  If you look at the WWS link Gurg provided, on that kill I gave back 6640 mana, which is basically 3 mana pots.  I think that's better to give to your other holy priests + resto shamans than to spec holy yourself with (I'd imagine) sub-standard gear for late in a T6 instance.  <br>
<br>
One thing is for sure though, shadow priests go to healers and hunters on this fight.  The fight still sucks to DPS on, but on the other hand you can concentrate bursts of 15 second DPS, and toss around shields and bandages during the other 15.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_433886"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->So is the reason Mother Shahraz is the cockblock in BT that she is that hard? Or because guilds have to bring like 5+ undergeared physical dps more than normal and that raid dps is way lower than normal?<br>
<br>
IE. If she didn't have the mana burn and prismatic shield do you think the fight would be significantly easier, bringing it on par to other encounters like say azgalor, requiem and gurtogg?  Or is this not a problem for most guilds since they actually have more than 5-6 raiding physical dps that were geared up from the begining?  This fight sounds like vael 2.0 in that you could bring 10 rogues to vael even if they were in half dungeon blues and trivialize the encounter.<br>
<br>
Also what is stopping destro locks from swapping between fire and shadow every switch and atleast pulling off 70% of normal dps?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_433895"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Because she requires extensive farming for resistance gear before she can even begin to be attempted, and because bad luck can screw you 20 ways to Tuesday if she decides she doesn't wanna bite it. Add that to the fact that she hits like a truck, healers along with DPS are all in SR gear, and she has several bugs - or at least, features which I'm fairly sure are not working as intended.<br>
<br>
Mana burn and prismatic shield are just icing on the cake. It would be easier if they weren't part of the encounter, but the same goes for pretty much any aspect of any fight (RoS P2 without soul shock or Gurtogg without BB, etc etc). It's not HARD per se - if the fight worked exactly like it did now with no OTs being ported, no FAs into couches or trees, and no MT knockback, I doubt it'd have the bad rap it does - just horribly random and a real blow to morale when you wipe on single digits to pure dumb luck when everyone is playing perfectly.<br>
<br>
Raid DPS is lower than normal because everyone is in shadow resist gear (~500 AP, ~120 HR and ~5% crit for me) that severely gimps their DPS output, not because anyone is undergeared.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

As to Praetorians comments on positioning.  Our tank is in the same spot.  I believe overrated's tank is as well.  Both guilds, along with celebrity and ours (and I know we have a kill in the bag, once we L2P/lotto) use 1 group clumped.  The difference is we put our guild in the alcove from which they took their screenshot.  Since doing that, and nearly 2 hours of attempts since doing that, we've only had 1 FA land in that alcove wiping the raid.  We really now are down to the issue of dealing with simply FA (since the MT death is extraordinarily rare, but it will happen when FA/sinister hits me).  FA + sinister is still a combo I haven't figured out how to deal with.  We're going to give an additional FA healer in the open region, and continue to use pots/HS's on each attempt - but the latter 2 are not sufficient for this combo.  I also think we got fairly unlucky on our "good" attempts last night.  Frankly though, we could position almost anywhere and if luck is on our side, that attempt can, and will, be a kill.  Some guilds position in the open, some guilds don't wedge their MT.  It all depends on where you want to put your eggs.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I always wonder why alot whine about the randomness of this encounter and then dont use a tactic that provides stability and progress by minimizing player error/getting routine/outgearing it.<br>
<br>
You will see a tank not resisting the knock up into the air and then getting lashed while flying. That is the only random thing i saw when using the open space. Keeping 3 ranged camps was for us the best tradeoff for less beam targets while still providing enough space and healing range on FA teleported targets. Im not sure if theres a spot where you can combine all (camps, space and an obstacle for your tanks) and still leash shahraz for wipe recovery.<br>
<br>
Any single of the deaths i see in our wipes can be countered when played properly, even the Vile Beam+FA combo.<br>
<br>
I guess its a choice of preference, but id rather pick the longterm working tactic even if it delays the first kill by a bit than to switch a cointoss tactic for a proper one when you outgeared it or it got critted by the nurfbat.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>We tried splitting our raid in three as well, we went with what was the most reliable - especially for *gasp* our guild.  Surprisingly enough, many other guilds use the one group strategy as well.  I fail to see how any of that is related to the failures of this encounter - or how it supports your point of long-term workable.  I'd also encourage you to read your own guild's reactions to this encounter actually when they first faced it.  <br>
<br>
Yes Vile beam + FA is potentially survivable (I use the word potentially very specifically here).  Sinister + FA will kill you though with a bad string of resists.  I'm not sure it takes a math wizard to prove that.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>If I'm reading you right, this matches our experience.  <br>
<br>
We used to fight in the middle, and I only got FA'ed upon once or twice ever in the open like this.  But against the couch, it tends to FA on top of me every other pull or so.  You basically have to decide - FA on the MT, or punts on the MT.  After being punted 3 times before the first FA once, I decided I had had enough.  Something approaching half a dozen punt/lash wipes in a row was getting on my nerves.<br>
<br>
The changes on the PTR will not fix some of these wipes.  She can punt so readily on the MT that you're going to see punts before ANY lash whatsoever lands (see the first post above, the PTR changes to saber lash do NOT fix this wipe).  Once you're saber lashed once, you're probably okay.  But it is not unheard of for an offtank to go a full minute without taking a saber lash.  However, by then we tend to have had that OT ported onto the MT.  Surprise cockfags, its Shahraz.  <br>

</div>You're right about having more open space, but the FA locations are always dice rolls.

</div>Its a shame the 1k crit flash heal didn't quite keep you up :P, I also think is shows the randomness to the encounter in the way that we still tank her in the middle and the tank will get punted once a fight maximum and for the last 3 weeks it has took us 3 tries per kill (save tard charges), but the fact your obviously wearing SR and taking more punts that we do makes me dread the day when we get 2-3 knockups and SL's each try<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_434225">I actually don't think that tanking in a couch increases the chances of being ported onto the MT.  However, tanking in the middle has the definite advantage of more open space to move through in the event that FA is on top of the MT, whereas when we tanked by the couch we oftentimes had the people ported next to or inside the couch, requiring more maneuvering and jumping before the ported people can get away from tanks, meaning they inevitably take more damage.<br>
<br>
In the winning attempt I think we had no less than 3 times when FA was on top of the melee + tank pile, but because it was out in the open people could mostly move away quickly enough such that the damage to the tanks was limited.</div>

<br>
I noticed by your combat log that one of your paladins FoL'd you.<br>
<br>
If they're MT healing (this might be my bias since we're doing this fight with 7 healers/2 pallys), they should NEVER EVER cast FoL under ANY circumstance. Always cook HL rank 11/9/8.<br>
<br>
They should hopefully have 4pc t5 by now, which might have saved that.<br>
<br>
Though it might be my bias because I basically force our paladins to spell haste/4pc tier5 for max HPS.</div>

		<div id="post_message_434239">That is our fast healer Covert - as indicated by many other posts here, MT healing is quite improved with 1-2 fast healers, and we noticed it helped as well.  It effectively increases your HP by 2-3k, and provides a bit of filler in those big valleys.  Anytime you die in under 2 seconds you're effectively dealing with damage that is not realistically healable outside of luck.  It is true that a heal could've landed from one of the 3 bigger healers during that time - but you cannot bank on it.  <br>
<br>
Keep in mind those shots didn't have a sinister beam, and no parry - which adds nearly another 15k damage to the "potential."<br>

</div>I'm not sure this is true either.  Maybe it is and we're unlucky.  But the attempts prior to just throwing our hands up and wedging the tank we had 5 or 6 (this is honestly not an exaggeration) wipes in a row from MT kickback/instagibs.  <br>
The final attempt in fact I was flung 3 times, once before I even landed from the previous kickback, all before 90%.  <br>
Sebudai here is indicating his guild had 3 mt KB's in roughly 10% of her HP as well.  <br>
<br>
I'm pretty sure however that fatal attraction + lash + sinister + 2 hits in 2 seconds is a guaranteed wipe.  Even with a 50% resist rate, you're looking at 32,000 damage in 2 seconds - up to 26k of which can occur instantly (this assumes the FA targets leave proximity in under 2 seconds).  Realistically this is going to shoot beyond 40k - add about 3k per second for every parry, which you can probably see 3 of in 2 seconds...</div>

As Quigon already said, you don't get FA on the tank spot that often in the open. I usually pop some sort of cooldown if I drop below ~15k with FA people close-by. Wearing more SR helps with FA and punts as well. I'm using 313 buffed right now and healing seems easier than it was at 200.

</div>The beam itself isn't an issue, but the beam/lash is what most people are complaining about It seems.  As you said getting punted and lash mid air is a pretty rare occurrence, but so is having FA port ontop of your MT.  If you can completely avoid 1 of those why not do it?  We got shahrandom on our 2nd try last week with some luck of surviving FA ports on our ranged then melee camp but we'll never wipe to a beam/lash.  I still don't see how being in the open will allow your MT to avoid death from bad FA placement just for the reasoning that he can adjust or your FA people can adjust better, your MT can use cooldowns in either situation.  In the open your MT can move aswell but people already complain about size of OT/MT effecting her lash not hitting the OTs, so by moving your mt increases your chance of this too.  Maybe we have been very lucky but we've never had anyone ported and stuck in the couch.</div>

<br>
Why does everyone use camps? and not individual spacing ala Naj'entus? It seems painfully obvious to me while looking at:<br>
<br>
Sinister Beam: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302200844/http://thottbot.com/s40859" target="_blank">Thottbot World of Warcraft: Sinister Beam</a><br>
<br>
Vile Beam: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302200844/http://thottbot.com/s40860" target="_blank">Thottbot World of Warcraft: Vile Beam</a><br>
<br>
And considering the nature of FA. Meaning that with one or two or even three camps, the amount of damage and potential for a wipe due to that huge damage from FA ports on top of those camps would be much higher than a port between two or three evenly spaced people. I can't realistically imagine the entire ranged raid or even half of it having the telepathic communication to all move in the correct direction away from a nearby FA while simultaneously having the FA'd person move in response to them or vise versa. Wheres having 2-3 nearby people move would be much more likely.<br>
<br>
No, I have not done the fight (yet, getting close) and I realize this another "help how does fight work" post with thottbot links to look professional, and it is. However I have read every piece of literature about this fight that I have available to me and think I have a very good understanding of the game overall and this fight. But the way many people are doing this just doesn't make sense.<br>
<br>
Maybe I am misunderstanding a mechanic that I have to experience for myself? Are the beam "jumps" infinite range? Even so the FA advantage seems to be enough to warrant spreading out.</div>

		<div id="post_message_434269">You clump to reduce the chance of being hit by FA.  There really isn't any other reason.  If there was no FA, the fight would be trivial.  When FA lands on the raid - especially back to back, the healing burden is absurd.<br>
<br>
With one camp especially, the majority of the time, FA will not land on the raid, and you won't have to deal with the extra healing.<br>
<br>
FA hits for 9,000 damage per second, starting at time zero.  That means 18,000 resistable shadow damage in the first second.  It is bad enough that it hits 3 people, but by spreading out evenly you're going to ensure that 6-8 people are basically getting reamed instead of 3.  That being said, some guilds do do a full spread out successfully.  Curse for instance, makes this strategy look very easy.  <br>
<br>
When the raid gets FA'ed you can typically HS/Pot - but then you'll tend to lose people on subsequent FA's.</div>

		<div id="post_message_434285">Does no-one else use a druid healer with swiftmend on the MT in this encounter? We use one and it seems to help immensely with MT damage spikes - at least we haven't wiped since the first kill to the MT dying to "normal" damage (i.e. punt-&gt;lash instagib is the only thing) even with OT's being ported occaisionally due to Lash avoidance. I'm not sure exactly what it is, but we just never seem to experience continuous occurances of "lolyouwipe" for more than 2 attempts, even with FA ports on the raid. If it weren't for the fact that we've now had 4 repeat kills with it dying on the third go or quicker every time, I would say that it's just luck and that there's nothing different with our strategy compared to others, but it seems we're doing something right. <br>
<br>
The things we generally wipe (or decide to reset) to are:<br>
- Back to back FA ports on the raid (only ever seen this once I think, we've had it more than once but with shadow pot/healthstone/bandage and capped shadow res on everyone it's survivable by the majority)<br>
- MT healers slowly dying off due to being crap at FA or having someone who can immune the damage being crap (paladin bubble running with them or mage blinking in a bad position, happens occaisionally)<br>
- Instagib on the MT (lash in the air - generally one of the two wipes each week is due to this)<br>
- Wicked beams for 60 seconds straight ending up with everyone slowly dying because of lack of heals because of mana issues (one-off, so far but could happen again).<br>
<br>
And then theres always the MT charging the boss and getting instagibbed because he's a tool (happened once)<br>
<br>
I'm also pretty sure that the beam has 20+ yard range on it - at least we had just as many problems (if not more) with people getting beamed with 3 camps before we changed strat.<br>
<br>
<br>
Does anyone else get regular occurances of one or two people getting ported instead of three? I assume it's to do with pets/totems - we normally have 3-4 shamans and 3-4 pets in the raid, which stacks up for quite a lot of additional targets that are (I assume) immune to FA. This week we actually had someone ported on the MT only to find he was the only one ported, and had to quickly jump out of the way to avoid saber lash.</div>

</div>Well thats the thing, this wasn't happening right on the pull or anything.  This was happening mid fight, when nothing would change.  5 saber lashes would go through and hit all three of us, none of us would move, and then bam, one shot.  Unless this is because my offtanks are randomly moving and then lying to me about it?  Who knows.<br>
<br>
EDIT: Actually this also happened once and I lived through it, and then they resumed as normal hitting all 3 of us without any of us moving.  7k, 7k, 7k, 21k, 7k, 7k.  And none of us moved the entire time.</div>

</div>Yeah, we use a druid keeping rolling HoTs + paladins healing the MT, and it works just fine.  As noted, no MT deaths really.<br>
<br>
Back-to-back ports on the raid has happened to us many times.  Or sometimes a single port on the raid when we're all desperately low on mana late in the fight.  We had a ~20% wipe to this last week with everyone alive, but after a lot of Wicked Beams late in the fight we were all totally desperate for mana.  Just as I'm saying, "Come on, bandage, HS, pot, anything... just do whatever you can to stay alive until healers can pot again," we get a port directly into the center of the raid, followed by a Sinful Beam.  No chance.<br>
<br>
Ports onto the raid in general are a major culprit.  They hurt a lot, and even if no one dies, it's almost impossible to top everyone off from that much damage in the time alotted, particularly with Shahraz continuing to pile on extra beam damage.  This is both a huge huge mana drain, and also poses the risk of someone not yet topped off being ported with only 50-60% health, which will almost surely kill them if it's a 3-man port in anything less than a perfect location.<br>
<br>
Other reasons to leash the fight include a couple of terrible FA port locations -- into a corner, inside a bench, inside a tree, etc. -- that kill crucial people early on.  We'll try to work through it if it happens late, but if the second port kills two MT healers at 85%, why bother, just leash and start over.<br>
<br>
I also know that bitching about consumables is a bit silly these days, but still, the fact that I absolutely have to chain-chug super manas on every single pot cooldown, starting from 90%, as a healer, is painful.  I've gone through 40 mana pots in ~3 hours on Shahraz before, and we've had to take breaks just to let healers go get more from the AH/bank/mailbox.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">1) You are wearing SR.<br>
2) There is a periodic 1k mana burn that hits up to 10 casters; you can resist the damage from the burn, but not the mana loss.<br>
3) Every 15sec she gains a new set of resistances, ranging from -10% to -90% damage taken, to each element, based on how much damage she took from that element during the prior 15sec.<br>

On the other hand, physical DPS faces no impediments whatsoever, besides SR gear.<br>

I see in this WWS parse that you still used 3 shadow priests even with all the mana burning and prismatic shields.<br>

Are shadow priests still that good here because of the heavy mana burden on the healers or did you just not have any extra melee to stack the raid with?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_434422"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Started looking into this fight a little more as we get closer to her in progression. From the Nihilum video I noticed that dots continue to tick for full value during prismatic shield as long as they were cast while it was down. On the kill in gurg's WWS, Siawyn's average VT tick was 325 damage; that appears to be far lower than what I would expect, since you could refresh dots right as prismatic expired, and again right before it was refreshed and all dots would tick for full value. Casting anything during a 90% shield, unless it's the final burn and you have mana to blow, seems like a total waste. <br>
<br>
It appears that the cast cycle you would aim for would include 4/5 imp MB and be Precast VT to land right as shield expires -&gt; SW:P -&gt; Mind Blast -&gt; Flay -&gt; Flay -&gt; Mind Blast -&gt; VT -&gt; SW:P -&gt; Flay. The final flay would begin right before prismatic went up and continue to tick for full damage past the prismatic application. One shadow priest would then cast 1 rank1 flay during the prismatic shield to maintain shadow weaving (and a darkmoon: crusade buff if applicable), and only refresh VE during prismatic shield (also refreshes darkmoon: crusade). This cycle also ensures that misery remains on the boss at all times. <br>
<br>
My only question is: does running a dot cycle like that screw yourself for the next prismatic shield? If I understand correctly, the number of stacks of the debuff depends on how much school damage Shahraz took during the previous 15 seconds, so would having your dots tick for full damage during a 9-stack cause her to have a 1-3 stack during your "nuke phase"?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_434455"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I don't have exact numbers on what triggers a particular stack level, but I would think having dots up from multiple people would certainly trigger a 2 or 3 stack at the minimum.  Then the question is, is having that dot damage worth only doing 80% damage during the nuke phase?  We always assumed it wasn't, hence we always made sure our dots were dropping off before you got far into the anti-shadow phase.  <br>
<br>
Ignore my VT average in that kill, I was actually testing a few things - it led to quite a few VT ticks at greatly reduced damage.  I'm glad you mentioned the Nihilum video because I think we misunderstood how the shield worked as a result -- which meshes with what I was testing.  I still don't think it's a good idea to refresh dots just before the 90% shield goes up though.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I don't think I've used 40 mana pots in total over all of our Shahraz attempts, it sounds like having only one ranged group isn't exactly the optimal strategy. Although I will agree there are still elements to the fight which should be fixed, namely the midair lash, the annoying objects with collision around the room, and maybe simply removing the mana drain.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_434489"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Is it definitely triggered by damage taken rather than number of spells in that school that land? If it hasn't been tested already, I imagine it would be easy to find out by having everyone dot the shit out of her at the end of a nuke phase and making sure nobody casts any shadow spells during the shield phase. If it was based on number of spells, at least the fight would be slightly less brutal on shadow priests (and warlocks). Hard numbers on what triggers it will certainly be something I try to glean from combat logs when we start working on her (assuming someone here hasn't done it for me by then).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Unfortunately, you continue to spread this false rumor. No matter how much SR you wear, you will not get an increased rate of FULL RESISTS on non-binary spells. There is a thread on this very subject in the mage threads in the class mechanics forum. Magic absorption will only realistically have a use on binary spells, which you won't see during Mother Shahraz.<br>
<br>
I believe that for the fight, assuming you run the least amount of casters, youre probably better off making sure you keep imp scorch up, so that this way you can increase your warlock dps. And assuming you run at least 2 warlocks so that you can have cos/cor, you should definately value keeping scorch up more than adding to your personal mage dps.<br>

Even with cap resist, rarely do you get a complete resist that allows for Magic Absorption to proc.

It seems that resist gear doesn't increase your chance to fully resist non-binary spells, it just increases the amount of partial resists.<br>
It only seems to increase the amount of full resists on binary spells.<br>
That would at least be a good explanation of it.</div>

		<div id="post_message_435012">I'm hitting nearly 30k armor myself when tanking shahraz.  I definitely take significantly less damage according to WWS parses than our tier 6 equipped feral druid.  He has about 37.5k armor (I get AH, he doesn't in our healing strats we used - due to cap proximity).  <br>
I think the difference was night and day.  The 10 and 16% damage reduction on melee and spells is more critical than anything - as deaths are generally not from a lack of mana, but from a burst.  And a warrior will simply burst for less.  Further, wearing SR tends to be easier on a warrior as just dropping a cloak can mean 1200 armor lost for a druid - and you get SW/LS/trinkets/ironshields.  The feral druid MT was the first thing we tried.  <br>
<br>
Honestly I think any guild working on this guy can kill him very early if the stars line up.  However, it takes about 5-6 hours to get to the point where you need less stars to line up.  Some are going to get lucky and get 1-2 man FA ports of the right people at the right place for basically the entire fight.  Couple of the video's I've downloaded I noticed there wasn't more than 1 or 2 triple FA's, and none on the raid.  Reminds me of doomfire never going into the raid.  Obviously if your FA's are easy, it is not a coincidence that it also is a kill-video.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">shahraz is one of the most uncontrollable fights they made anyway. being able to resist the fatal attraction is such a joke. it can be 4-5 ported. or it can be 2. then if you don't resist the mana drain a few times in a row, you just want to vomit.<br>
being able to fully resist some of the key abilities can make this fight undoable if extremely unlucky at times and really easy if you get very lucky on resists. encounters like that are just frustrating and shouldn't be designed like that. make the mana burn unresistable. same with fatal attraction. and make it always three people ported.<br>
then the saber lash adds a debuff that makes you immune vs the knock up. that actually exists already. however its horribly coded and doesn't work at times.<br>
just add dmg to saber lash but make it highly mitigateable by armor. and then no knockback in front of her in the saber lash area ever. that way you still need multiple tanks in front of her that would never get knocked up while with increased dmg there's no way you could cheese it with melees in front (which would be rather retarded with parry increasing her swing timer anyway).<br>
<br>
anyway, my point is that the fight sucks atm. and it could be fairly easily made a lot more controllable.<br>
<br>
Oh, and I almost forgot about the damage shields. I had much fun as a shadow priest. Just an awesome mechanic.</div>

</div>The only thing that is getting old is reading stuff like yours kaib.  Where after killing a fight 3-4 times you forget how retarded it is, and start letting your ego do the talking.  Please, just don't "contribute" when your only point is that "its fine, stop whining."  People here aren't idiots - people here aren't whining out of turn.  There are a lot of smart players here, good players here, who want this fight fixed.  What is getting old is people who have utterly no concept of scope and design beyond their own nose - spewing off about the joys of broken encounters with no purpose other than to protect their sense of accomplishment and pride.  <br>
<br>
I cannot imagine any rational person would post that Mother Shahraz is a good encounter - unless they've already defeated it, and then it should be obvious why they are saying this.</div>

		<div id="post_message_435103">Well, you got that wrong. I'll try to be less cryptic:<br>
<br>
"If you use one range camp, don't complain about unlucky FAs and excessive mana burn."<br>
<br>
The stuff I brought up in that post that should be over one month old (that's a damn long time when it comes to wow content btw), still stands up. That the ability that prevents your tanks from getting thrown up just does not work is ofc a joke. But as someone pointed out before, it will rarely wipe you. Very,very rarely.<br>
As Praetorian said before, the shield is extremely frustrating for casters and there simply is no similar effect that gimps melees as much in any wow content.<br>
<br>
Those points have nothing to do with you picking a strat that exposes you to bad luck and then keep complaining about just that. Again, it might as well be the mathematically correct strat. Sometimes you have to call, even if you know that you are behind.<br>
However fact is if you use several range camps, you give your raid a LOT more breathing room for bad FAs. If your healers have exceptional reaction times, you can always save some people. If your guys use CDs correctly, you won't have a ton of people dead if 3-4 FAed guys end up on one of your ranged camp. And if only 3-4 die, that is something you can recover from.<br>
<br>
I am not saying it's a better strat either. You do get a lot more bad FAs. 2nd last week bo wiped until trash was back up. This reset it was a 1 shot. But I am sure that almost all our wipes could have been kills if people played better/reacted faster. Just like in about every single wipe we ever had in any boss fight.<br>
<br>
All of this is beside the point. You picked a 1 camp strat. It might be right, it might be wrong. That is hardly up to me to judge. But if you go with that plan, you will end up getting screwed by FA on your camp. And I have read that often enough by now. It's gonna happen. More often for some guilds, less often for others. That's life. Reading something about getting to a point where 'you need less stars to line up' just makes me sick.<br>
<br>
And looking at this wall of text makes me sick too, I liked my original 2-line post much better.</div>

<br>
In the end, every single fight has some luck factor.  The goal of a strategy is to take as much of that out as possible.  While I am not currently working on shahraz, my guild has begun work on archimonde, and while its not easy, I think a lot of the "luck" claims are blown out of proportion.  I would be willing to attribute every failed attempt to strategy.  Now, I admit some attempts play out much better than others, but that doesn't mean I think those others are beyond control with proper strategy.  <br>
<br>
In the end, 1 fight with a slightly higher luck factor might be frustrating, but is it really so intolerable that there is a small luck factor in ONE fight compared to not having to get world buffs like mad from pre-TBC, or farming 200 herbs for a pre 2.1 raid?<br>

</div>We got about as lucky as you could probably get - unless the fight was changed, which is why I'm asking.<br>
We removed the MT saber/KB - and put the raid in a spot that so far has only been FA'ed maybe once or twice out of 50 pulls.  So it comes down to the MT not being FA'ed, and FA'ers not dying to attrition.  Or the MT being just destroyed/chain wickeds/dumb ports - actually theres a few things that can go wrong.  Its nothing but a relief, but just seems fishy.</div>

We got her to roughly 20% on our first night so we cannot complain too much but personally I got ported into a pole once and ported, punted. We also had our well geared tank get essentially executed on multiple attempts. <br>

In the end there is no reason to complain, everything has been said already. Normally it is easy to offer constructive criticism of the encounters but Shahraz is just a disaster.

</div>We had our elemental shaman respec halfway through the night. We're trying to recruit another resto shaman too. But yeah it's pretty bad. We've only had 7 healers on the roster for a while as recruits keep turning out sour. It's a good thing we still clear SSC and TK every week I guess...</div>

850 strikes me as a little on the low side.<br>
<br>
Also, stack stam? or more spell damage. I can stack about 700 more hp but I'll lose about 80 spell damage. Worth it?</div>

</div>Since this seems to have not been answered yet.<br>
<br>
I was running around 1000-1050 spell dmg fully buffed in my SR gear.  (50/11/0).  I chose to stack spell dmg being I was around 10.5k hp raid buffed with my dmg gear on, if your under 10k with your dmg gear on I would think about putting on a bit more stam.<br>
<br>
While the debuff might seem to be completely random, I have had no problems controlling the debuff and maximizing my dps. On our killshot, I was only around 700dps, but I had FA a number of times, you can get by with 1-2 FA's on a killshot.  Generally you can look to put up around 800dps on this fight after becoming comfortable with it.  Dont expect much more then 500-550 dps until you know the fight, learn how to countrol the debuffs and get your spell rotation down.</div>

</div>Thats not to say that taking 2 enhancement shamans, 2 warriors, 5 rogues, 1 warlock (dps from one warlock + CoR &gt; one more rogue), 3 tanks and 12 healers wouldn't get you the kill within the timer though. It might be a bit dodgy if you lose some DPS to bad ports, but as long as you have a few druids it'd be fine, especially if you stack shaman for blusts.</div>

				Mother Shahraz <br>
- The players targeted by Saber Lash now gain the immunity to Sinister Beam and Fatal Attraction, regardless of whether or not Saber Lash actually landed. <br>
- Shahraz will now pick a new beam to cast after every 3rd cast, instead of every 5th. <br>
- The first two seconds of Fatal Attraction now deals reduced damage. <br>
- Prismatic Shield has been completely reworked. The shield is no longer adaptive. She periodically picks a random school to be resistant to, and the "opposite" school gets a bonus. Casters rejoice. <br>
- In a later patch, we're blocking off some of the nastier places to get placed by Fatal Attraction, and the "Couches of Death" we'll be fixed. In the meantime, you should be able to mitigate a problematic Fatal Attraction teleport by tanking Mother Shahraz away from these locations. <br>
- Also in a later patch, we'll be able to disable the "decreased melee swing time" effect caused by Mother Shahraz parrying a melee attack. The parry mechanic is exacerbating the already rather intense burst damage that Mother Shahraz can inflict.

</div>Sounds like us, 1-shot Shahraz. No primer, practice.. just pull, execute, kill. We even had some shitty shit happen with people dying on FA, but utilized the resses and ankhs, and trudged on. MT even got punt-lashed at 18% but he instant shield walled and took the 5900 hit with wall up. I've never before seen such a clutch wall! Pretty damn crazy.<br>
<br>
It's good she's getting changed, I just wonder how small the FA damage for the first 2 seconds is. 2 seconds is pretty large, surprised it wasn't just the first second. I also had no idea she casted Beams that way, where she chain casts one on purpose and then switches. <br>
<br>

I recommend guilds attempting her make about 80 shadow protection cauldrons, and use one EACH pull, and quaff them blindly when you're FA'ed.  You typically do not have time to respond to your HP with reactive quaffing.<br>
<br>
We also did CoR - excellent idea, worked wonderfully.  We turn it off at 12-13%.  <br>
<br>
I'm really happy to see the changes to shahraz and archimonde - they remove a lot of the randomness without much of the difficulty, but of course, this probably will not go live for a while.  <br>

</div>In the hopes that the powers-that-be are continuing to read, I'd sincerely, sincerely hope that this is a global change to eliminate an annoying mechanic. The global sweeping strike and cleave changes made the game MUCH less frustrating in so many situations, and I don't see how a complete re-thinking of mob parry mechanics would break the game in any way. (Like, say... Twin Emps port issue, anyone?) It's not even a needed mechanic, the way crushing blows are (sorta), unless you want to factor in tank weapon skill/hit rating as a mitigation consideration.<br>
<br>
Then again, Al'ar's charge change was only band-aided for that one mob although many others would have benefitted by a global change. So... who knows? </div>

</div>In retrospect, learning this fight -- with so many "unlucky" scenarios -- was the hardest part. And if you are rolling some bad dice, Mother is not too forgiving. After killing her, it doesn't feel so bad. Port in the raid, "We'll get her next pull." Before it was just cursing and hate for the randomness, where those events compound on the fact your raid is still learning to cope with the standard abilities.<br>
<br>
It's amazing the attitude change our raid experienced this week, when dealing with early ports between ranged / melee or ports into geometry. Knowing it's a kill without that luck is all that matters. We also used CoR and had in-raid ports on our kill this week, and that's really a testament to how Mother can bring the best out of your raid and its spirits.<br>
<br>
I enjoy the fight, in its current form, even as a shadowpriest who bandages the raid 50%+ of the time. But I'm not going to forget what a nightmare luck played on our learning experience, like I believe some horn-blowers have done here. The changes will be well received, and I don't find they will take any value from kills henceforth. The old Mother will always have a special place in my heart -- that sexy bitch.</div>

</div>You get infractions for being a dumbass, not for making a point.<br>
<br>
Anyway - I'm not sure there was much that was truly unique about mother.  I still believe it is basically 10 abilities given to a rather ordinary boss, almost all of which we have seen before.  Give each random timers, and call it an encounter.<br>
<br>
FA is basically meant to be the fight - but the collision of all the other abilities ends up making learning and sometimes repeating a kill frustrating at best.  And getting FA's on the raid, or not, dramatically changes the difficulty of the fight.  Sure you can "Spread out" - but when 75% of the time you can have 1 group and 1 melee group that never gets FA, you set the fight up to be potentially much easier.  It reminds me a bit of the old doomfires - where you could kill archimonde and never have a doomfire within 80 yards of your group.  Although my problem with this fight isn't really FA's on the raid (although FA's on the main tank is pretty bad at times).</div>

</div>It would work but you'd have to make the ratio really ridiculously high, so that a single volley of holy shocks and Surge of Light smites with no spellpower is enough to re-normalize shadow, or drop the debuff back to something very light. Basically, something that wouldn't hinder normal raids but would still provide a decent bonus on dmg on the fight to raids set up like Blood Legion.<br>
<br>
If you really wanted to make it complex they could work in a ring, so that if you have a relatively equal threshold of damage incoming in each school, all caster damage is increased.</div>

		<div id="post_message_438335">I have to agree that using a multiple camp strategy makes Shahraz much much easier. We spent our first night working on Shahraz, and by the end of the night I could tell that basically everyone understood what was going on with the fight (the abilities are all simple and easily understood), and was dealing with the FA's when they got ported pretty well. However, whenever there was an FA on our single ranged camp, things would just kind of explode. Even if no one died, the raid healers couldn't really catch back up, and it would eventually lead to a wipe.<br>
<br>
The next day we went in and decided to use a 3 ranged camp strategy, and killed her on the second pull. At least half of the FAs land on or near one of the camps, but people move out of the way and keep themselves up appropriately, the rest of the healers keep up the tank, and we got a very clean first kill. We killed her on our first pull this week, again, with a lot of the FAs hitting one part of the raid or another. Looking at our parses we got an average number of Wicked Beams both weeks as well. We only had 8 healers this week as well, the raid damage increase due to having FAs constantly hitting about a fourth of your raid, is pretty easily dealt with, with the ranged DPS helping to heal themselves (bandaid frequently, hp / pots used for survival).<br>
<br>
We don't really stack melee either - one enh shaman, one hunter, 4 rogues, 1 dps warrior (one more melee DPS than on a normal fight basically, and I usually prefer to give the extra rogue's spot to a healer, we were just short one). Didn't use CoRex as we were kind of short healers for the fight.<br>
<br>
The changes that are planned seem like they will make Shahraz pretty trivial TBH.</div>

She has a good amount of HP, and your DPS is gimped by Shadow Resist/Prismatic Shield.  The raid takes massive damage from the various beams and FA, and your healers are gimped with SR as well.  And they're getting mana burned.<br>
<br>
Now out of all these elements, what's changing?  FA is more forgiving (will do similar damage if handled poorly, less if handled well), and your casters will be able to do more damage so she'll die faster.  The things that make the fight challenging are all there.  The Prismatic Shield mechanic was never a real challenge, it was just a way to artificially limit your DPS, and it rewarded raid stacking to an unconscionable degree.  The FA changes make an FA port on top of other people less damaging (you get two seconds to move before the real damage kicks in) but they don't really make the ability much different as the vast majority of FA ports are handled appropriately (and do little damage).  Also, since you are guaranteed a 3-port every time in 2.2 the reduced early damage is offset.  FA ports on top of the tank or on top of a ranged camp are just as likely to happen.<br>
<br>
Conclusion: The changes are a good thing, they will not make the fight significantly easier to execute.  They WILL make the fight more repeatable.  You can trumpet your 3-camp strategy or in-the-open positioning all you want, but it's a dumb encounter right now and if the RNG decides you will lose, that's it.  We one-shotted her this week with zero deaths, does that mean the encounter is completely fine?  No, it means the game gave us an opportunity to win and we played well enough on that run to kill her.</div>

		<div id="post_message_438360">I don't see how one strategy is easier than another.  I think you just came back the next day - fully understood the fight, and as most people do - almost 1 shot the boss the next day (countless guilds one shot new encounters on their first few pulls of the following night - we one shot every Hyjal boss our 2nd night basically - and we 1 shot shahraz on our 2nd serious night of attempts - I don't really count farming/testing a mod to be a serious night).  <br>
<br>
On the one group strategy, you are putting your eggs in one basket - but typically the raid never gets FA'ed in our case, so I cannot see how 0 FA's on the raid is harder than some FA's on a spread-out raid.  <br>
<br>
We wiped 5-6 times last night, and all of them were due to things like FA's into furniture, or triple FA onto the melee, or both OT's being ported simultaneously, followed by saber lash.<br>
<br>
Had you changed strategies at the end of your first night and noticed an improvement - I might agree that strategy triumphed - but on fights like archimonde/shahraz, strategy really is not a big part of the fight (unless you call wedging your MT under a couch "strategy").  Individual execution, and a little luck tend to rule the day.  And what works for your guild might not work for others - afterall there are guilds who did this over a month ago who used both strategies just fine.</div>

</div>8 is just fine ... If you can stack phy dps and healers, sure. But it's not really necessairy. It makes it a bit easier, but if people are stupid with FAs, an extra healer does not help either. And well after the patch I very much doubt more then eight healers is desireable. The faster the bitch dies, the less 'oh shit' moments you can possibly encounter.</div>

		<div id="post_message_440034">We've tried it with 8, 9, and 10... and 10 was clearly the best setup for us.  We have a MT healing strategy that makes it so the MT will simply not die outside of parry streaks, which contrary to some opinions, will kill any tank if they are bad.<br>
<br>
Also, using 150 SR on this fight is probably not recommended.  Even if it works (I love it when people tell me shit like "it worked last time")... it doesn't mean it will always work, nor is it reliable or a smart idea.

</div>Yes this is right.  You get exponential returns on resists - for essentially linear item expenditures.  More SR is increasingly better up through 295 unbuffed.  <br>
The last 100 points are worth the same amount as the first 200 in terms of relative improvement.  <br>
<br>
With the streakiness of the FA, I'd think you would want to stack every card in your favor - and that is how we do Shahraz.  We stack our players, strategy, consumables, classes, and positioning to minimize the worst possible outcome.</div>

		<!-- message -->
		<div id="post_message_440070">Since they're changing the fight ill throw out a couple helpful suggestions that havent been explicitly stated.<br>
<br>
1)  The FA port is not entirely random.  You can only be ported to a location that is within mother shahraz's LOS.  It has a max range of about 45 yards.<br>
<br>
Extending upon this, if you make the shape of mother shahraz's field of LOS very narrow in one direction and very large in another direction, you can strongly reduce the chances of a port in the middle of the raid, particularly ranged dps and healing camps.  With some clever geometry you can keep 2 ranged camps in a very narrow swath of LOS on mother and a third camp of healers out of her LOS but within LOS of the tanks.  All 3 of these ranged camps wont chain eachother on beams.  There are a couple spots in the room where you could set up like this.  We use the column in the north west.  You can also position a healer outside the max range of the port near the "large area" to support soft and low initial health people.  We use a very quick fingered holy priest(in max shadow and stamina gear, he takes a pounding) to give people that little bump they need to live.  I'm too lazy to draw out a map, so if my commentary isnt clear and you'd like some clarification, let me know.<br>
<br>
This setup captures the benefits of the 'single camp' and avoids the excessive beam chaining.  The downside to this is that it makes melee ports somewhat more frequent then in a 'out in the open' position.  The 'rare' narrow los port is pretty much a wipe.  Overall though, it makes raid crippling FA ports far less frequent.  2 of our last 3 kills have been "one shot".  I look at mother like a slot machine.  Keep putting your quarters in til you win.  <br>
<br>
A final note regarding los...If you can hit mother mother can hit you.  This isn't 'exploitive' losing, its firemaw style.  Anyone this might help would probably realize that though.</div>

Even if it works (I love it when people tell me shit like "it worked last time")... it doesn't mean it will always work, nor is it reliable or a smart idea.  I believe you're taking 18,000 resistable SR in your first second of FA portage.</div>

</div>Yeah, 7 healers is doable, both of our wipes on 12% and 15% were when we had 9 healers in raid, and in both cases one healer died on first teleport, and the second healer when he had ~50k healing done, so pretty fast. <br>
If we would have 2x melee dps instead of those 2 healers who died, they would manage to take those 15%s out of her <br>
Wonder how long did your kill take with 7 healers 3 tanks and 15 dps - it had to be less then 5:00 minutes?</div>

By having 9 healers but stacking melee DPS (8, with 5 casters), our best was ~5 minutes 50. There's quite a significant difference in length between the two just because of the healer difference.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">With some clever geometry you can keep 2 ranged camps in a very narrow swath of LOS on mother and a third camp of healers out of her LOS but within LOS of the tanks.  All 3 of these ranged camps wont chain eachother on beams.  There are a couple spots in the room where you could set up like this.  We use the column in the north west.  You can also position a healer outside the max range of the port near the "large area" to support soft and low initial health people.  We use a very quick fingered holy priest(in max shadow and stamina gear, he takes a pounding) to give people that little bump they need to live.

</div>The main reason i noticed was down to looking at your WWS, I couldn't believe how much fatal attraction damage he had done, then I checked a few of our WWS and other guilds and noticed its quite common to do 50-100k for fatal attraction damage.<br>

I guess thats just if you get victimised by the beams and ported onto the raid.<br>

		<div id="post_message_441308">I believe the 1 camp strategy is a winner.  Especially in the bench alcove, I can count on one hand the number of times an FA has landed on our raid - in what is probably about 50 total attempts.  You set yourself up for possible failure, but then again you stack the cards so heavily in your favor that MOST of the time you're going to be okay - lets be honest: Shahraz is FA, plain and simple.  By effectively removing FA on anyone besides those being ported, you remove one of the harder elements of FA (and further we have survived FA's on the raid, as long as they're not in furniture and not back-to-back, or poor resists all over).  Combined with shoving the tauren under the couch, and using massive consumables - you're going to eventually win.<br>
<br>
On another note, I'm still glad this fight is being changed (obviously).  It is a shame that the hardest fight in the game is only hard because of the terrible way in which random abilities were thrown together on it.  Whoever designed the end bosses of each zone really should take 10 minutes and make sure these "lesser" encounters aren't so retarded.</div>

</div>Well, thing is, no one in BO knows anything about enhancement dps. The other shamis took it to level up and then went resto again. So no one noticed really and he did decent dps always. He's also using Rockbiter (as you can see if you select him in WWS and then switch to the full report instead of just the Mother fight) to not eat up WF procs with his fast off hand. Guess he did not know that a 2nd WF is still more dps. Gonna be fixed though, I hope. :P<br>
<br>
But tbh in the end it doesn't matter. It's a minor mistake and probaby reduces his dps by a few %. WoW is way too easy for that to make a difference and I am pretty sure almost every guild has some guys with minor mistakes. For example I see a lot of mages raiding with fire or ice specs, which is dps wise just a joke. That again includes our guild ofc, PvP specs rule! :P<br>
<br>
Check this for example:<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304075118/http://www.lossendil.com/wws/?report=paseolaczruci&amp;m&amp;s=8538-8606" target="_blank">Wow Web Stats</a><br>
<br>
As long as you got a spriest for mana, an arcane mage willing to use a lot of mana pots is just blowing a fire or frost mage away. RoS is a silly example, but still he managed to outdmg rogues and mages with that spec are generally very high on dmg done while others are not exactly up there.<br>
But when all is said and done, WoW end game raiding sadly comes down to 'Are you able to avoid killing yourself due to not being able to press the correct button?'. If you have enough people in a raid (enough varying from 20 to 25, depending on the encounter) to reply  to that question with 'Yes', that is all it takes to clear the current PvE content.</div>

We got tons of 3-ports, and lots of mana burning.  But we had absolutely zero ports onto the melee or the ranged/healers.  And that's all you need.</div>

</div>When we started Shahraz, and even into the first kill, I was depressed because I realized that even with perfect execution there would never be a guaranteed "one shot" every week. The more I've done it though the more I am convinced that you can kill Shahraz within 3 pulls every week at least, with 90% one shots, if you just immediately flask and blindly use Shadow Prot. pots / healthstones off every FA and use a one camp strategy. Barring the tiny chance of the worst possible FA location in the corner or furniture inside the raid, you are basically guaranteed survival and can C.Bat/Ankh/SS most of the rest.</div>

<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304075118/http://www.lossendil.com/wws/?report=paseolaczruci&amp;m&amp;s=8538-8606" target="_blank">Wow Web Stats</a><br>
<br>
As long as you got a spriest for mana, an arcane mage willing to use a lot of mana pots is just blowing a fire or frost mage away. RoS is a silly example, but still he managed to outdmg rogues and mages with that spec are generally very high on dmg done while others are not exactly up there.<br>
But when all is said and done, WoW end game raiding sadly comes down to 'Are you able to avoid killing yourself due to not being able to press the correct button?'. If you have enough people in a raid (enough varying from 20 to 25, depending on the encounter) to reply  to that question with 'Yes', that is all it takes to clear the current PvE content.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>Off-topic, but as Manly noted, you can't really use a fight where you get to spam Arcane Blast for 90sec while your spriest is returning insane mana with a damage multiplier as an example.  Maybe it's just that I haven't seen it done "right," but our mages have tended to experiment with different specs and there hasn't been a noticeable difference between fire and arcane on average.  Our usual top-DPS mage is pretty much full frost for everything these days (water elemental, etc.), since he's on a 2200+ 5v5 team, and since frost spec is just plain better for fights like Illidan and Archimonde (i.e., the only fights that still matter, once you're farming everything), and he still does 1200+ DPS on static fights like Teron.  <br>
<br>
Anyway, kinda far afield from Shahraz discussion, but most of the thread will be obsolete once 2.2 hits.</div>

</div>The problem is that not FA deals the dmg, it's the player dealing dmg to each other. PoM does not work in such situations. Otherwise it would take a LOT of pain out of the whole FA ability.<br>
There are patch notes that say something about PoM getting fixed in that perspective. That would actually be a pretty big buff as it most likely works with Lifetap and similiar stuff as well then.</div>

</div>1200-1300 isn't the 4136 in that WWS parse on Essence of Anger either.  Arcane is fine but with mana restrictions it isn't far and above other mage specs as far as any parses/personal evidence I've seen.<br>
<br>
We have a mage who raids as arcane, he does great damage, but so do other mage specs.  Unless I've missed something, Manly's point that an Arcane spec doesn't get fully utilized outside of Essence of Anger is true, it's still a solid spec, but I haven't seen it be leaps and bounds above other mage specs.</div>

</div>As I told you several times, I can do the same for fire spec. The problem isn't finding parses where arcane mage does well. The problem is that being selective in the shown parses is the same as a half-truth.<br>
<br>
And in this case, giving only essence of anger as example is clearly a case of being selective in given parses.<br>
<br>
And just because you keep denying everything I say, FYI, I have been arcane spec for quite a while now. I don't intend to keep it however, but that's a matter of personal preference more than anything else.</div>

</div>The shorter the fight becomes ( ie the more you have it on farm / outgear it etc ) The more DPS Arcane will put out. <br>
<br>
Meaning, it will scale not only with <i>your</i> gear, but with your <i>guild's</i> gear. <br>
<br>
For Example -- T5 raiding for T6 guilds.... all fights that used to be 8/9 mintues are now 4/5/6 minutes. Fire simply cant compete in this arena when an Arcane mage can AB spam for 75%+ of the fight instead of 50%<br>
<br>
One day, without fail, we will outgear BT/Hyjal. <br>
<br>
We are all just a couple of upgrades away from being completely maximum geared for our specs. and once we are all capped out, Arcane will put out more and more DPS every week as the rest of the guild finishes their gear, and fire/frost will stay the same.</div>

Overall it's repeatable, but like people have said, I don't want to do that fight again. Using 2+ ironshields every wipe to have some random shitty luck of FA port on me or FA port on the raid hurts bad. Her getting me down to 1k or so HP makes for some bad moments of panic. Think this is the only encounter in the game where I feel I am helpless in keeping myself alive other than using avoidance trinkets in hopes of some lucky dodges.<br>

We moved our ranged camp from the center of the walkway to the wall behind the couch and it seemed to work a little better for us, although we did end up getting 3 ports on me and 2 on the raid in our next couple of attempts. <br>
<br>
Great thing about our night, spent 2 hours attempting her and had 1/5th of our raid D/C with the authentication servers down. 20 minutes later everyone finally came back online and we proceeded to nearly wipe to the trash packs up to her at least 3 times. First pull went perfect and we killed her. Made for some rather confused people looking at how bad we were at trash.</div>

The whole parry mechanic still needs to get looked at. It is one thing to get a hasted counter attack, it is another to go on a killing spree with instant hits because of parry chains. Blizzard could, for example, give mobs a minimum delay that will never be passed, no matter how many parries happened in the last second.

		<div id="post_message_442304">I need the defense trinket. I was using Scarab of Displacement so I could use Praetorian's Legguards. I was running 24% dodge without GoA. I would LOVE the shadowmoon insignia, as I could use that in place of the scarab. It has yet to drop though. <br>
<br>
How much shadow resist do you(r) tanks use? I've set the minimum HP I want to be 21k fully buffed. In the experience I've had with her, if she wants you to die you will die. Some combos are just not survivable regardless of how much HP you have outside of last stand. I opted for 200-250 SR buffed and as much avoidance as I could stack. Moroes pocket watch is really nice for the times where my FoL spam pallies got ported. Having a stam trinket in that slot just didn't seem as beneficial as the dodge trinket. To me, 500 more stam didn't outweigh having another oh shit button. The only time she killed me was when I got ported on/parry streaks/shitty combos like my screenshot above. <br>
<br>
*edit* Parries can really destroy your attempts in no time. Whether they do something like Dots mentioned or reduce the attack to do 30-50% damage, something needs to be done. I could deal with a 3-4.5k hit from a parry, but having mobs like azgalor/mother who can hit for an insane amount is just heartbreaking. Nothing you can use consumables-wise makes a dent in that sort of damage. One of our attempts last night on mother I had 1 second left on ironshield and she parried a revenge, hit me for 9k in the split second it took me to chug another ironshield followed by a 9k saber lash.</div>

		<div id="post_message_442333">I think I was sitting at 47.11% avoidance with 15934HP unbuffed. SR for our attempts I've always gone low (219 buffed) and I've done fine. Healers didn't notice much, if any difference between 219 buffed and 273 buffed. Maybe I just got really lucky in that regard. According to my combat monitor, avg damage taken on beams was higher with 256 buffed than it was with 219. I could attribute that to a larger sample size (4 hours the night before vs 2 hours the day after), but the avg was 700 more damage which seemed pretty significant. I wish we had a WWS parse. Hopefully next week I can get one for you all.<br>

Also, with that low of SR, a port on me can be pretty bad. If I'm quick on using trinkets and CD's I can stay alive so long as she doesn't parry gib me in that timeframe.</div>

</div>Maybe it wouldnt be so farfetched to expect that one point, for bosses at least, the parry-haste mechanic would be completely dropped. They already said they aren't even happy with the level of randomness that crushing blows adds, and could possibly change how it works in the future, so, perhaps, they could do away with the parry thing and just insert additional specials/enviromental events to make sure the encounters still have the 'oh shit' element causing nasty spikes and stressful/wipe-inducing moments.</div>

		<div id="post_message_442625">I think part of the issue with crushing blows is that due to the high avoidance that tanks can get towards the end/completing the t6 instances, crushing blows make up a huge amount of the hit table. In my tanking gear I'm on a little over 52% dodge without GoA (something like 58 with it, and it's likely to go higher when I regem my helm/get a new chestpiece) and if you incorporate miss rate, it's an average of nearly 60% total avoidance without GoA, or 65+ with it. This means that the 15% crushing rule gives me a ~35-40% chance to take a crushing on every hit I take, and that's pretty serious when you're looking at something that hits as fast as Bloodboil (which is the only boss in BT/Hyjal I MT, for reference) or any of the other dual wielding mobs (illidan/shahraz).<br>
<br>
Parry strings are a fairly alright balancing mechanic for any boss that doesn't AoE silence (azgalor, shahraz if you're stupid, possibly gruul in here too), fear (archimonde), force more than the MT to be at the front (shahraz), or dual wield (shahraz, illidan, bloodboil), and those with random target mechanics and turn round are not much better either (shahraz, illidan, gruul, teron, archimonde(?), quite a few more here too but it's not a significant aspect unless grouped with one of the above) . In the case of mobs that do, it's an unnecessary aspect of randomness considering how much the tank spikes in those situations already, and those that have more than one of the above aspects is just asking for the parry mechanic to be turned off (illidan although he doesn't really need it, archimonde, shahraz especially).</div>

</div>Avoidance certainly doesn't increase the spike damage a player might take. The only thing it can really do in this regard is make a boss appear to deal more spike damage, when in actuality they aren't.

		<div id="post_message_445579">Hi, first-time poster. I have some questions regarding the process of gathering shadow resist gear prior to attempting Shahraz. Figured this might be more appropriate in a new thread, but I suppose it can work here too.<br>
<br>
From my calculations, the number of Hearts of Darkness you’d need for anywhere from 25 to 30 people (depending on how much of a cushion you want) to be in max Ashtongue shadow resist gear is between 225 and 270. Having been doing BT for about a month now, we’ve only had roughly 50 drop. We have made a point to clear every trash pack for a couple weeks now (up to RoS), but as of yet we have not resorted to soft-resetting to reclear packs.<br>
<br>
What has your guild done to get around this? Is it simply a matter of dealing with whatever number of Hearts you have, and resorting to greens and maybe just brute-forcing it without full SR? Or have you grinded your way to 225+ Hearts through raid- and off-day trash farming?<br>
<br>
I confess that since we have not yet attempted her, I don’t have a full sense of how much different amounts of SR affect the damage output of the encounter. Is there even a point to going into it without max’d SR on the raid? Will it just be a waste of time until we can get everyone full Ashtongue sets?</div>

		<div id="post_message_445586">I don't know what you included in your calculations, but I'm pretty sure a common thing guilds do is not crafting the legs. They take the most hearts and they really are more than you need, and also replace a primary gear slot that you want people using good gear in. The more common solution is the bracers, belt, boots, cloak, next, and then a few random odds and ends. Usually a head enchant, one green piece of gear (rings are best) and a shoulder enchant. Don't forget to supply armor patches for the boots and anyone who uses a green chest or gloves. A common thing people in my guild did was get a secondary socketed shoulder that was decent, added shoulder enchant (+7), then one or two void spheres (+4).</div>

		<div id="post_message_445653">For Hearts, you'll want to start farming early. First, if you are also working on or clearing Hyjal, consider leaving Shade of Akama for later in the week. With 5 people (including mage, shadowpriest, and depoisoner), the ~6 stealth pairs and ~3 triple packs can be cleared. With 10 people and preferably two of which beings tanks, Teron can be cleared.<br>
<br>
If you're working on Shahraz, you might then consider farming the trash leading to her, several times per day. We see more drops (and of Illidan ilvl) from trash than the bosses themselves, so there is good incentive for your raid.<br>
<br>
We sent out 6 Hearts to all our raiders, one slot at a time, without regard to pants. She can be done with less and wearing more greens. Put your casters in crafted SR last, unless 2.2 hits before your killshot and 2.2 improves caster usefulness on Shahraz. I personally wear everything but pants and a green chestpiece to cap. I am Undead, receiving 10 SR, but I would have otherwise patched my chest with 8 SR (instead of 150 STA). I believe this to be the best path, with a helm+enchant also being a sound option.</div>

It puts you at 240ish SR with enchants, and people worked out the last bit with BoE greens / enchants / flasks. We're letting people who would get a substantial stat upgrade (mainly the shadow prot flask users so they can use a real flask) get their last two hearts now, before we start giving them out for other craftables.<br>
<br>
People should try to get 295 unbuffed with only one extra green piece this way. Stress that it's important to get to 295 unbuffed, because with the way resists work, it's exponentially better than 294 unbuffed, etc.<br>
<br>
edit: yeah, definitely get casters the SR last. We actually bring a few more casters than average probably, but effectively there's no real reason to bring more than 1 Warlock, 1 Mage, and 2 Shadow Priests in terms of caster DPS if you can afford to stack melee + healers. (Although a good Felguard or Destro Warlock can actually do pretty competetive with the melee DPS, we bring 3 Locks and I specced Felguard for our first kill and did pretty well in comparison to the melee.)</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Yeah that is a pretty heavily stacked raid right there.  About a 5 minute kill - thats fairly sick.  <br>
<br>
Your MT is taking too much damage.  He doesn't have SB up enough (even without crushing it is still relevant), and maybe 2 ironshields isn't covering him fulltime unless he pops one before the log starts.  <br>
<br>
Also 9 total AH/inspiration procs is really increasing your MT damage.  Adding a crit healer just for AH - and then adding CoR will probably shave another 30-45 seconds off this fight, and reduce damage taken at the same time.</div>

</div>The log looks a bit strange.  You can see there are 28 "shield block" casts, yet 37 "reinfoced shield" which procs 100% on shield block.  Obviously he did more than 28 shield blocks, and possibly more than 37 (as the log is strange).  AF should have been up more, no doubt.  Not sure what happened to the person doing that.    He does pre-pop IS so that was up all the time.  <br>
<br>
We downed her again for our second kill tonight.  I think it was 3rd attempt after some very bad FAs.  Even on our kill, we had several FA's in the raid and managed to survive.  I think this fight is much like Arhchimond - with each passing week it becomes less about "luck" and more about knowing what to do in certain situations.  If these fights stayed exactly the same 2 months from now, they would be 1-2 shots every time.</div>

</div>I'm pretty sure you should only count reinforced shields - because shield block lasts longer than the cooldown, and about a quarter of the time it is still up when it is reapplied - and I don't believe this shows up as "gaining shield block" because you already have it.  This is just a guess, but I think that is what is happening.<br>
Still, 37 reinforced shields at 5 seconds each (cooldown) is only 3 minutes of coverage - hence my statement.</div>

		<div id="post_message_446186">Has anyone found any neat tricks to reduce the number of deaths from FA?  We've killed her a couple of times but had plenty of wipes on our third try tonight.  Sometimes we get wiped by people getting ported onto the raid or burst damage on the MT.  We accept that those are going to happen, but when we get lucky and these things don't happen we should surely be winning?  However most of the time our wipes are caused by a trickle of deaths from FA building up to a wipe.<br>
<br>
Our strat for people getting ported is to run away from the other two who got ported.  It's fine in principle but when a couple of people run off in the same direction they end up taking a pretty large amount of damage before they can work it out and thats when people start dying.<br>
<br>
I have wondered whether giving people assigned directions to run ahead of time would reduce the possibility of them running in the same direction.  Or basing it on the bigwigs announcement (e.g. first name runs east, second west, third north) but people seem to think that the bigwigs announcement is too slow to be useful.<br>
<br>
Does anyone have a better method of dealing with FA, or are we just bad at running and/or using consumables to stay alive?</div>

</div>I can't even describe how precisely this echos our experience.<br>
<br>
We tried presets of melee east, healers west, dps north - and then had a mod doing it with tells.  But just going with "wing it" ended up being vastly superior.  This is also what I would recommend new guilds do - just "wing it" and you will acclimate and improve on this aspect of the fight over time.  <br>
<br>
We also crafted about 100 shadow protection cauldrons and use one on each and every pull - it works wonders.  <br>
<br>
Still, when you get a triple port on the tanks... and 2 of them are your offtanks, I'm guessing you're dead.  <br>
<br>
Or perhaps if you get ported inside the couch the main tanks are in, get stuck there so badly it requires all 3 of you to be ported out.  <br>
<br>
I took a screenshot of our last shahraz night.  I edited it slightly so as to reflect what I think people were thinking.  <br>

We use some general guidelines like melee strafe left, ranged strafe right, healers stand still and heal. But for the most part, it still comes down to using consumables and correctly reacting to the situation, not running into camps, standing in bad spots, and so on. Especially on the triple healer port.<br>
<br>
Players do get a lot better with practice though, 2 of our last 3 kills were one-shots. Last week we had to reset twice because of massive player errors. One of the OTs decided he did not like his spot that much on the pull, resulting in 24k Saber Lash on the MT (other OT had yet to do any offensive actions on Shahraz). The other mistake was a new healer incorrectly assuming that standing still under the mob with FA on was a good idea. I guess those general guidelines that we use can backfire... it still went reasonably well, but a few people died to that and we had to abort at 40% or so because of the domino effect.<br>
<br>
Maybe I am indeed a lucky charm and you would have won with me there. </div>

</div>This.  This fight kind of reminds me of bloodboil with fel rage when someone dies, and it turns out they forgot aspect of the monkey, inner fire, ice armor, barkskin, etc.  Like he said every class has a little trick they can use to help them out (warriors can also intervene).  I'm pretty sure we haven't had a single death due to FA ever unless someone either forgot to use their trick, or they had a lot of shit on cooldown.  I can't recall anyone ever saying "I went defensive stance, used my pot and healthstone, intervened to someone, but I still died!"  It's always "I forgot to healthstone/pot" or "Everything was on cooldown because I got ported three times in a row."<br>
<br>
Also another thing that helped us a lot was telling people that its ok to run into the camp if you get FA.  We use a 3 spot strat so running into a camp isn't immediate death, but even with a one spot strat I think this has some merit.  Back when we were learning the fight we had a lot of cases where people would get ported between the melee and the single camp (back when we used this strat) and they would often all run the same way and die, and the excuse was "i didn't have anywhere else to run"  Running into your camp(s) isn't the end of the world if you get FA, if only one person does it there really shouldn't be anyone that goes below 2/3rds health.  Having people all run the same way guarantees death, whereas having one person run onto one of your camps might be a lot more raid damage going out, but if it breaks his link faster and the result is 0 deaths, then it's definitely worth it.</div>

		<div id="post_message_447077">Taking some advice in this thread into consideration, here is our kill from last night: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304062334/http://www.lossendil.com/wws/?report=o1kfvdvxmwffy&amp;s=5189-5561&amp;m" target="_blank">WWS</a><br>
<br>
Added a shaman to try keeping AF up fulltime as well as a holy priest trying to help whenever possible. This kill took 6:02 and the previous was 5:04 with the main differences being OT's not attacking nearly as much as well as some pretty bad luck with FA's landing on the raid. Good awareness, quick movement and use of healthstones/consumables allowed us to survive the FA.<br>
<br>
Like Saabik said, it's still a hectic fight but as we've experienced many of the bad things that can take place during the encounter we've had less issues dealing with them. I don't know if I'd ever go into the fight expecting a 1shot but a kill in less than 5 or so attempts seems doable, about the same as Archimonde.<br>
<br>
edit: seeing the PTR notes posted above, perhaps a 1shot will be in order. FA on the OTs and FA on the raid has been the cause of almost every wipe we've had (save for a few instances of crazy burst dmg to the MT) and those changes look like they will help those wipes become kills or near-kills in the future.</div>

</div>A neat trick we've been using is this: Resto Shamans keep Totem of the Maelstrom equipped and are specced 5/5 Tidal Focus (pretty standard for any full Resto build).  Whenever we have a spare global cooldown we toss a Rank 1 Healing Wave on the MT.  With 5/5 Tidal Focus and the Totem, those rank 1 heals are literally zero mana, but they heal for ~450 (grats bugged Healing Way buff) and can proc Ancestral Fortitude.  They also allow us to drop out of the five-second rule and get some extra regen.  With 2-3 Shamans using this trick, AF uptime on the MT is dramatically increased and it's done during the  small breathers you get between FAs and beams.</div>

		<div id="post_message_447256">Our offtanks wear about 250 buffed SR.  You can simply WWS it and do a very quick calculation over 15 or so pulls of how to maximize efficiency.  <br>
<br>
If you're concerned about burst damage, add more SR (although warrior OT's can compensate a number of ways).  If you're concerned about efficiency try to find a nice mix.  <br>
<br>
Our offtanks tend to only die on shadow burst combinations - and that is when a triple FA gets stuck in the couch we're tanking on, or a triple FA on our tanking spot that is combined with a vile beam, sinister beam, saber lash, or any combination of those.  I haven't died as a main tank in a while outside of 2 spectacular deaths earlier this week (I do mean spectacular).  <br>
<br>
We also lost our offtanks about a couple times this week due to one or both of them being ported back-to-back followed by lash/sinisters (this is with their backs turned from the start).  The double OT-port insta-saber lash wipe is something that is just epic to behold.  Obviously there isn't anything you can do about this outside of dropping defense on the tanks - and is usually rare.  But you're going to see tanks ported, and giving them SR for survivability makes sense.<br>
<br>
Just answer the question based on healer mana and where your problems are coming from.  We tend to usually NOT have issues of needing more SR on the OTs.</div>

</div>I think you should distinguish between hard and stupid-hard.  Shahraz is challenging because of the numbers involved, the pressure on your healers and DPS to perform at a high level even in capped SR.  But the real reason people fear her is not the challenge of the fight, it's the potential to get totally owned by dice rolls.  The difficulty when you get lucky (no FA ports into furniture, no offtanks getting ported) is quite reasonable...in fact, last week we one-shot her with no deaths despite 95% triple FA ports, some heavy mana burning etc.  Why?  Nothing retarded happened, and we played very well.  "Playing very well" should be enough for a kill.  Hopefully that will be the case in 2.2.</div>

<br>
Main melee group was Kamien, Crookgrin, Modrack (Fury), Sebudai and Arkadu, all sustaining 1100 to 1400 DPS with &gt;= 365 SR. Grim was in a "bastardized" DPS group with Yugami (Arms), Crat, Sadris and I believe a resto Shaman, with Windfury. Now I'm pretty sure WWS doesn't yet eliminate Fatal Attraction from overall damage and DPS calculations like it does with Shatter, but even without its damage those numbers are still respectable.<br>

So I don't consider the nerf a big deal.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Hi, first-time poster. I have some questions regarding the process of gathering shadow resist gear prior to attempting Shahraz. Figured this might be more appropriate in a new thread, but I suppose it can work here too.<br>
<br>
From my calculations, the number of Hearts of Darkness you’d need for anywhere from 25 to 30 people (depending on how much of a cushion you want) to be in max Ashtongue shadow resist gear is between 225 and 270. Having been doing BT for about a month now, we’ve only had roughly 50 drop. We have made a point to clear every trash pack for a couple weeks now (up to RoS), but as of yet we have not resorted to soft-resetting to reclear packs.<br>
<br>
What has your guild done to get around this? Is it simply a matter of dealing with whatever number of Hearts you have, and resorting to greens and maybe just brute-forcing it without full SR? Or have you grinded your way to 225+ Hearts through raid- and off-day trash farming?<br>
<br>
I confess that since we have not yet attempted her, I don’t have a full sense of how much different amounts of SR affect the damage output of the encounter. Is there even a point to going into it without max’d SR on the raid? Will it just be a waste of time until we can get everyone full Ashtongue sets?</div>

</div>The Trash before Mother herself is a excellent source of hod's, you get 6-7 avg per clear and it can be done with the minimum of 10-12 people. We got 170+ within 9 days. We did farm it quite a bit though. So after you kill RoS you'll have plenty of time to farm them.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_447940"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->The attempts certainly got a little better after a couple of hours today.  Although I wouldn't say  hit a point where everything clicked, we definitely got a feel for it.  Pidgeon steps, I guess.  People died less frequently to FA by the end and I think SPPs should save a lot of those close calls.<br>
<br>
Our main problem (much later in the session oddly enough) seemed to be FA onto the 'one lump raid' when many were at less than full health which turned into an insta-abort more times than I could count.  For the last few attempts we experimented with LoS, so people wouldn't get ported into healers and it definitely seemed to work.  Possibly some geometry to be done tonight methinks.<br>
<br>
One thing which was a minor dispute was Shadow Protection on the MT.  Pretty soon after we started the MT had switched back to normal gear.  Healing him, I didn't notice an enormous difference (to be honest he wasn't wearing it long enough to make much of a considered comparison either way....), although he did die to burst a couple of times yet said none of it was shadow damage.  So are tanks wearing full SR mainly because of the ports onto them?  If Lash makes him immune to beams, what else is he resisting?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Yeah this is basically it.  We had back-to-back stuck-in-or-near the MT's couch ports for nearly 5 attempts in a row.  It was so bad we thought she was actually changed.  Once this stopped she promptly died.  I'm not sure what one can do about triple ports on the melee where half of the people are stuck - or take a few seconds to move.  I could add more SR, but me dying isn't the problem - its everyone around me while they're taking 9k SR a second.  Some people are going to take low resists, and even with lightning reflexes it is too much damage to take more than once in a 30 second period.  <br>
Our kill attempt she chained wickeds on us also - it was only because people were so good at FA, and none landed in the melee that we were able to pull it off.<br>
<br>
I know so many people just do not look forward to this fight - and that IMO is a problem.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_448095"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->So our first kill we used the middle of the path and had a knockback + Saber Lash fiasco that Sebudai already accounted. Then the second week we used the couch, and got through it. This week we started with the couch, and had 5 or 6 wipes from ridiculous FA ports - <i>inside</i> Shahraz's model hitting both the melee and the tanks, against the waterfall near the MT healers, on the healer pile, a number of times on or near the melee pile and the capper, in the corner, behind the tree and the bench, facing the corner, with 3 people.<br>
<br>
We then went back to the middle of the path and beat it on the second attempt. I think the knockback and Saber Lash is the lesser of two evils for us at this point, and less likely to happen.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I specced Destruction while learning Shahraz and picked up Nether Protection to see if it worked.  It's pretty helpful, but not as good as you might think.<br>
<br>
Nether Protection procs from getting hit by beams and being targeted by the initial Fatal Attraction spell, but doesn't proc from taking damage from Fatal Attractions.  If it procs from the initial Fatal Attraction, though, you'll be immune to FA damage for Nether Protection's duration.<br>
<br>
There's also a cool bug that you might see.  If you get targeted by Fatal Attraction while Nether Protection is up, you'll get teleported but won't get the FA debuff, resulting in a pretty easy Fatal Attraction port.  The chance of this happening is very rare though - you'd need to get hit by a beam, have Nether Protection proc, then get targeted by FA within the next 4 seconds.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Dice rolls yaaay.  She fires 5 beams of any given type in succession, at random targets with bounces.  I'm not sure how many times they bounce, but the range seems to be ~10 yards.  You never see beams crossing the gulf between the melee and a single ranged clump, for what it's worth.  Anyway, if she targets the melee cluster with Wicked Beam...nothing will happen, because the only people in melee range with mana are Enhancement Shamans.  Notice there's one Enhance Shaman on the parse (Berg).  Now, WWS doesn't let us see how many times he got hit by Wicked Beam but my guess is he accounts for those 3 hits, and had the beam just skip him the other 2 times she fired it.  I've personally seeen Shabadu (our Enhance Shaman) get hit by Wicked Beams as the only person taking damage.<br>
<br>
A Shahraz pull where she drains a total of 3k mana from the entire raid during the fight is a golden kill opportunity, unless FA really screws you.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Our problem is still the regularity with which this happens.  It's getting better though...at least I think it is.<br>
<br>
We were playing around with a LoS strategy tonight, using a column to basically protect ranged and healers from ports, which initially seemed amazing.  However after a 20% wipe (screwed port attrition more than anything, totally player error...), our luck ran out a little and almost every other port seemed to land right on top of the melee group.

</div>We've taken 40 wicked beams in the first 15% of her health before, and then taken less than that on a killshot.  <br>
I believe they're attempting to reduce this variation with the fixes in 2.2.  <br>
<br>
Wickeds should bounce 15 yards - and you can see them crossing large gaps if your camps are spread as opposed to clumped but spread.  This is one of the main advantages to spreading out, but you have to be careful not to link camps.  <br>
<br>
This beam is really only an issue if it is chained.  It can literally fire nonstop for a full minute - and if this happens very late in the fight, or after an FA in the melee, you're going to have problems.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_449210"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I really do think tanking her in the middle is best. As was posted earlier, we killed her once in the middle, but almost wiped at the end of that winning attempt due to a KB fiasco that had not happened on any of our learning attempts. So the next week we moved her to the couch and killed her that way. This last week we once again tried the couch, but just kept getting bad FA locations. Eventually we just got fed up and moved her back to the middle and killed her handily.<br>
<br>
Bad FA port locations are absolutely more likely to occur when you tank her next to the couch and I don't think you can really chalk those up to bad luck. Like 30% of your FA ports will be to locations that fall into the bad category when you put her there.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

We seemed to have a contrary experience to every other guild currently in existence... I filled their head with horror stories about the upcoming encounter, but we went in and the night was just filled with all kinds of hilarity.  We wiped horribly of course, but as far as I can tell everybody had a great time (except for a few rogues and warlocks but they're always emo anyway), and I haven't laughed that hard on a raid in awhile about anything from 2 tree druids getting ported and assassinating the third person with their slow asses but living themselves, to the variety of increasingly ridiculous ways people came up with to categorize movement on the FAs.  Had to be there, but it really seemed like everyone had a lot more fun than anybody was expecting.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, I told them after Azgalor that Archimonde looked like a cakewalk.  Then he got buffed the next day, and we had to learn him that way over countless wipe nights.  So maybe it's just that we've already been through such a ridiculous morale shock that this doesn't seem so bad at all.  Time will tell if the tune changes or not. =]<br>
<br>
And no, I'm not being sarcastic.  I'm personally looking forward to doing this sexy, broken encounter again tonight.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<!-- message -->
		<div id="post_message_452055"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Our experiences have followed what a lot have been saying. Our third kill on her was a one shot. We got relatively lucky with no parry gibs, one port on top of the raid that we recovered from, and no ports directly on the melee/tanks. With our experience we were able to turn decent luck (or lack of bad luck) into a relatively clean one shot.<br>
<br>
A few people still retard out and hold hands while they have FA, but most people have gotten good at adjusting on the fly. We don't have any special direction assignment system, just wing it, and it works quite well as long as people are quick to adjust. One trick that helped a lot was telling people to only ever adjust direction in 90 degree increments. That way you absolutely maximize the potential distance between people. The biggest problem in the past we had was not people running right on top of each other, but people running at a small angle away from each other and thus not increasing the distance between them fast enough. The 90 degree thing solves that problem well.<br>
<br>
As far as positioning and all that, we've continued using the one ranged clump next to the pillar with tanks dead center of the path. I think we've only had two ports EVER inside of a couch and we've only had knockbacks on tanks in maybe 2 or 3 attempts. For these few bad luck wipes we've been rewarded with very few ports inside geometry and relatively few ports on top of the raid. Definitely great for repeat kills.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_452313"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->We tried spreading out vs. the 1 camp strategy last night to compare difference - and the bottom line is there is almost no difference.  We only wipe maybe 1 in 4 or 1 in 5 attempts from a port on the raid.  <br>
<br>
However, the reason we wipe most of the time is the triple FA's on the melee that are back-to-back or more than 3-4 per attempt.  We had a large number of attempts last night where the melee got FA'ed 4 to 5 times out of 8 ports.  It was just unbearable.  <br>
<br>
I basically can't say strategy really factors into this fight much.  Doing well at FA is important, but I'm not sure how guilds deal with 2 to 3 FA's on the melee in a row, or 5 or so in a single pull.  <br>
<br>
We also had a ridiculous number of FA/Sinister beams where players died at time 0 through time 2.0.  This is with pots being used... I'm not even sure what to say about those.  These are good players dying.<br>
<br>

<br>
For tanks out there, anyone have some profiles on gear they use? I looked at our WWS parse and looked at some other guilds parses for the same amount of time in combat with her, and I take alot more damage than most tanks. There are a few flaws in our strat to kill her. We don't use any feral OT and we don't always have AF/Inspiration up. <br>

I took an insane amount of damage since BOTH the SL tanks died somehow at one point or another so that parse isn't that great to gauge for our normal kills, but I don't think a normal parse will vary too much. We 1 shot her in that parse, but it was sloppy. I'll see if we can get a better kill next week to see.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_452334"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->We have been using a spot completely different than any listed in this thread(Possible I have skipped a few posts though)<br>
<br>
On the second set of carpets where the AOE pack spawns on the left, there is a "nook" in the wall which prevents the knockbacks, but the really nice part of it is in over 60 attempts, I don't think we had a port directly onto the melee or tanks, some are close but for the most part we had really nice port locations, the biggest issue ended up being ported into the fish heads by the fountain.<br>
<br>
My favourite part about the location is we have 1 ranged camp further north and a lone priest behind me within intervene range, and if I don't get sabre lashed mid intervene she basically auto-leashes.<br>
<br>
Sort of hard to tell from our killshot, but I had forgotten to take screenshot last week and we haven't done her this week yet.<br>

		<div id="post_message_452351"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->That is interesting - by tanking there you prevent the melee knockback and prevent a large number of choices for FA locations that would otherwise be near melee in an open situation.  You expose your raid more in doing this, but I assume then you're spreading the casters out.  <br>

Some of Shahraz is luck-based, but so is some of every fight. Shahraz is over all pretty controllable with a proper strategy and good execution. We've killed her in 3 or less pulls every time since our first kill, and I never really feel like we're definitely just going to wipe because of what's going on. It's always 'well, if only so-and-so had done better at this-and-that, charlie wouldn't have died.' The only change that I think is really necessary is Saber Lash's debuff lasting longer. After the FA nerfs and caster buffs on this fight, it's honestly going to be pretty trivial IMO.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">We have been using a spot completely different than any listed in this thread(Possible I have skipped a few posts though)<br>
<br>
On the second set of carpets where the AOE pack spawns on the left, there is a "nook" in the wall which prevents the knockbacks, but the really nice part of it is in over 60 attempts, I don't think we had a port directly onto the melee or tanks, some are close but for the most part we had really nice port locations, the biggest issue ended up being ported into the fish heads by the fountain.<br>
<br>
My favourite part about the location is we have 1 ranged camp further north and a lone priest behind me within intervene range, and if I don't get sabre lashed mid intervene she basically auto-leashes.<br>
<br>
Sort of hard to tell from our killshot, but I had forgotten to take screenshot last week and we haven't done her this week yet.<br>

We actually tried that spot for a few trys one night, we had the exact opposite results, I think we had more stuck in terrain ports and more ports that landed on the tank (and sometimes gibbed) than standing in the middle.  After wiping to so many bad FA locations there we went back to the middle of the hallway and killed her.<br>
<br>
I do have to say the biggest thing I'm looking forward to is the saber lash immunity fix.  We definitely had a wipe this week where one OT got ported, the other got knocked into the air, and I got lashed for 21k sitting just normal.  And I know our feral OT is never happy when he turns around, sits down, and she misses 3 times in a row.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_452940"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->You must be unlucky on Hearts, we just killed EoS last week and now have something in the lines of 150 (with a few items crafted too), which means we should have enough of them by the time 2.2 goes live, and it gives us some time to relax and prepare for the burn through of Mother-&gt;Illidan.<br>
<br>
I'ld strongly recommend putting your focus on BT first in the week so you can unlock the pre-Mother trash and farm it as much as possible if you think you can kill EoS, else mix-match your raids so you can maximise the amount of trash to clear each week. We often ended a few raids with clearing the Gurtogg trash for the last 10-30mins of raid time.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

That's what we did.  No legs, except for people who absolutely couldn't hit cap without them.  We made like 3 pair total.  6 hearts plus a green hat with an SR glyph and you're good to go.

We obtained so many hearts by farming Teron trash, which we used to 8-15man, we simply left Teron for the last day of the reset, and cleared his trash multiple times during the week. Gems for roll, epics for roll, hearts to bank, allowed people to gear up a bit and to get some gems for pvp items. Quite enjoyable thing to do.<br>
<br>
<br>
Playered: Shahraz is rather easy encounter, yes it is very random, but it is easy. Leaving her waiting for 2.2, which may come this week or in a month, isnt the best idea.

		<div id="post_message_452968"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->We blitzed through bt w/o alot of luck on the heart side, we made a full 25 man raid with full SR (except tanks and offtank only getting 200 SR i believe) to do this, we basicly pushed our kill back till the next reset and just farmed trash...alot of trash. It's a good thing that trash is relatively fun, and can be done with 10 people (or less depending on the people, time you have)<br>
<br>
But a few things. 1) she's pretty easy when you only bring 3 casters and 9-10 healers. 2) Nightelf SP are a bit over powered (racials) 3) if you dont want to get the pants its pretty easy to make up the SR with AH greens that may be better suited gear wise anyways.<br>

Side question about her trash:<br>
We cleared this trash thirty times I would say, and have yet to see 1 cloak out of it. In fact we have only seen 2 of the shadow dmg cloaks in the entire time we have been in BT. Is this just a horrid drop rate?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Wow.  That's pretty bad luck.  Every single Warlock and Priest(both Shadow and Holy) in our guild has one of those cloaks.  A couple of random other people took cloaks for looks and we've de'ed maybe 3 of them, too.  It is by far our most common trash epic in the zone.<br>

We'd had pretty plentiful trash epics clearing the trash and that encouraged a lot of people to show up for heart farming nights.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

With the changed 3 ports instead of less, how you handle FA and if you can keep the tank up will be the fight. Not having enough DPS wont matter since it will become a little more caster friendly soon, but if you plan to bring the same raid post-patch they might as well learn the abilities now.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_455831"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->It's split between the people it tried to hit, so if both your offtanks dodge it won't be an MT instagib (which would be utterly stupid and end up with offtanks wearing pure stamina greens to get rid of avoidance in combination with shadow res).<br>
<br>
If you're having issues with hitbox, however, that means it didn't even try and hit. This means that you end up with the 0/12/12 that you listed, instead of 8(dodge = 0)/8/8 that you would have otherwise. The fact they put in this mechanic, and then didn't extend the immunity debuff by default to apply to anyone saber lash tried to hit is also a complete oversight, and I can't believe it's taken/taking so long to fix it.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_456079"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->We killed her yesterday for the first time, on the second night of attempts. What worked best for us was grouping casters/healers in one camp and, far away, 2 healers for FA. As said before, use cauldrons every single attempt!<br>
<br>
About FA, the latency of the players of my guild is aroung 500 ms. I don't know if this is ping related of just client-side coding but we get a lot of the "I win Arathi Basin start race" issue that if you and another player start running towards the same direction at the same time, you will always see your character in front and the other guy will see his character in front which leads to "omg! you followed me during FA".. "no, no you followed me". <br>
<br>
For this case, turn spell detail off (because of the explosions) and sct off, so you can see your FA "link" clearly. This way you can see if you are being followed and change direction.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div><br>
I actually tried this for a while as a Prot Paladin SL soaker.  It worked out better than I expected.<br>
<br>
First of all, the current version of the fight actually punnishes avoidance.  And SL can't crit, so I was able to mix up some high stam healing gear with my tanking gear.<br>
<br>
Secondly, the silence was not as big of an issue as I expected.  I was in max SR and easily resisting over 70% of the silences.<br>
<br>
The consistent damage you're taking means you have unlimited mana so you can spam to your heart's content.<br>
<br>
A Prot Paladin with 900 +healing spamming FoLs on people isn't going to knock anyone's socks off, but it's a hell of a lot more than what a Warrior or Druid SL soaker is contributing.<br>
<br>
I wouldn't try it with a Holy Paladin unless he had some really good high stam gear.  Even then you have to accept that there will be times when he gets silenced so you can't put him in a vital healing assignment that requires 100% attention.<br>
<br>
<br>
The whole ballgame changes with the announced changes, though.  When the new mechanics go in, you'll want to stack avoidance gear to decrease the SL damage and don't want to be casting.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I usually shift out to heal myself with 2p nordrassil or to barkskin/rebirth/innervate. As long as people wait for my call take the combat rez its 100% safe.

The silence is shadow resist base, during the fight out paladin averaged about 80% resists with 250 SR, and imp conc aura lowered the duration from 8 to 6 secs which negates it pretty nicely. Also gained 23k mana from eating the damage. <br>

Trying before with druids and warriors as offtank I have to say paladins are much better atleast before parry mechanics are changed.<br>
<br>
Silence was not a big problem, but cant say how often they where silenced. Their job was to heal each other and MT. Both healed &gt;150k in than fight, more than other MT healers mainly cause mana returned from heals they received. One resto druid was enough with aid of random chain heals to keep them up.<br>

</div>I don't think Argent Defender would be that useful, considering the majority of the damage you'll be taking is coming in HEAVY spikes.  Taking your average Saber Lash hit from last week of 9913, Argent Defender would only reduce that to 6939, which would require you to have 19826 hp to survive.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Same here as far as consistency. We originally had our MT prot warrior doing it but he would fall over dead on way too many occasions. When we originally learned the fight we did the fight with fewer healers than most other guilds call for, we had 8. We only had 2 paladins on MT heals and it wasn't working. Switching over to a feral druid significantly reduced the damage as he has a lot more armor in SR than our warriors do.<br>
<br>
As far as ports on the tanks, it's not necessarily a wipe for us. It's definitely not good but we've been able to heal through it more often than not.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

That being said, before tonight we used a feral offtank, he battle rezzed, innervated, and applied his dot.  You'll want at least 250ish buffed SR for an offtank - more the better really.  <br>
Our feral also has absolutely absurd gear - so take that with some grain of salt.  <br>

The warrior offtanks worked rather well for us however anyway.  Although he's well geared also I suppose (edgewalker, dexaar).<br>

Don't kid yourselves.  I personally do not recommend you even attempt to use snake traps for this encounter.  I have seen no evidence that they cause less than 3 teleport FAs.  For all we know low FA teleports are when she chooses saber lash targets - it would almost certainly be more common to have less than 3 if pets and totems counted.  We already know azgalor only does empty Dooms once in a blue moon, and the assumption here would be when it chooses the MT.  It might also be why the "Fix" to &lt; 3 ports is coinciding with saber lash fixes.  Just a theory...<br>

Learn to deal with FA - its the ONE thing you can control about this fight.  Typically if you lose no one to FA (in terms of appropriate spreading out), you will be in a great position to win.  Positioning, luck, and gear basically make up the rest of the fight.  Strategy need not apply.  <br>
<br>
We did try using an internal mod on day 1 to tell people which way to go.  The mod figured out the 3 people who got FA, and told them north, west, east.  We then told people to turn this off and just "wing it" and they did far better as such.  I explained this in more detail earlier in this thread, or in another thread, and as always Juggernaut went through almost the precise experience and outcome as we did.<br>
<br>
However, for new guilds, I found this interesting mod which adds a graphical element to this idea.<br>

<br>
You can test it out and see if it helps your guild - but the disclaimer is the same idea without arrows was terrible for us - but the arrows might buy you the speed and focus to make this reasonably work.  <br>
<br>
Also, turn off SCT - it lets you see the FA lines and gives you a clearer pictures of where to go to put those lines behind you.  Hope that helps.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_472802"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->If you can't survive a three person FA 95% of the time then you are going to be in big trouble. After getting used to the encounter you will be able to survive FAs on the raid, people getting ported into corners and all sorts of other terrible situations. One of the solutions our guild discovered to survive FA was to have the healer stand and heal themselves while the other characters ran away. If two healers got ported someone on vent would call out who should sit and spam themselves while the others ran away. The arrow mod that Quigon pointed to above is helpful but not a fix-all by any means. Familiarity with the encounter, solid dps and exceptional situational awareness from your players will do more good than any gimmick.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_473203"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->my guild killed shahraz now 2 times, and the main key was really just stacking. and i mean healer stacking. we had 2 days of tries with 7 / 8 healers, and it was a pain in the ass .. i don't think we got her much lower than 50 %, and all the healers were moaning about low mana etc. then on the next ID we tackled her with 9 healers, and down she went. this week the same - we got her second try, after a MT port wipe on the first try. <br>
<br>
if nobody fucks up badly, the only thing that can kill you apart from freak wipes is healers being oom. with more healers, FAs aren't as big of a problem, a chain of wicked beam casts doesn't completely fuck you up .. it's much more relaxed. we even had a few FAs where people ran like headless chicken, but they still survived it thanks to the extra 1-2 healers in the raid. a few guys who didn't experience our pains with shahraz really wondered why we did wipe in the first time. <br>

so in case of doubt - bring more healers !<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Sorry to bump this from a page back, I haven't had time to browse EJ for a couple days ; &lt;<br>
<br>
Here's WWS for a couple different attempts:<br>
Warrior MT <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081109170300/http://titans.darkstargamers.com/wws/9-05/shahraz/bittar.html" target="_blank">http://titans.darkstargamers.com/wws...az/bittar.html</a> &amp; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081109170300/http://titans.darkstargamers.com/wws/8-23/shahraz/bittar.html" target="_blank">http://titans.darkstargamers.com/wws...az/bittar.html</a><br>
Druid MT <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20081109170300/http://titans.darkstargamers.com/wws/8-14/shahraz/nizi.html" target="_blank">http://titans.darkstargamers.com/wws...hraz/nizi.html</a><br>
<br>
The bottom line numbers are: <br>
Warrior MT Fight 1 - Mother Shahraz inflicted 571,850 damage across 272 hits (avg 2102 max 12238) on me. (One of our OTs died towards the end so we were splitting Saber Lashes between only 1 OT and MT) (Fight lasted 6:56) (wearing only SR back)<br>
<br>
Warrior MT Fight 2 - Mother Shahraz inflicts 717,845 across 321 hits (average 2236 max 9113) on me (Fight lasted 8:15) (wearing SR back/neck/wrist)<br>
<br>
Druid MT Fight - Mother Shahraz inflicted 766,093 damage across 280 hits (avg 2736 max 8037) on Nizi. (Fight lasted 7:02)<br>
<br>
Contradicting what Metro wrote, I'm taking less damage per hit than the Druid OT. I'm also getting hit less. My gear is better, but the only gear I have that wouldn't be available to a Warrior MT tanking Shahraz for the first time are Tier 6 bp/shoulders.<br>
<br>
I think the big advantage for a Druid MT is that one of the situations that's bound to occur a couple times per fight (melee/saber lash/melee across 2-3 seconds) will result with the druid, on average, having more HP left due to higher AC. This is probably where the perception of a Druid taking more consistent damage comes in. However, due to this fight mostly being about 90% execution and 10% handling "oh shit" moments, I think the Warrior is a better choice due to all the cooldowns (healthstone/last stand/shield wall/Shadowmoon Insignia/Iron Shield or Shadow Protection pots) that are available. Maybe I'm a bit biased though. ; &gt;<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_473487"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Warriors are definitely the superior tank for pretty much every encounter, it all comes down to the player controlling the character.<br>
<br>
We pretty much only use a Druid to MT her due to our first 3 or so pulls our Main Tank (warrior) was getting dominated while we were still working on healing delegation. By the time we tried a Druid tank on the 4th pull or so, healing was pretty much finished being delegated and so we just kept with him tanking. Since she died pretty quickly after getting everyone assigned to whatever they needed to do for the fight, we just stick with it because it works for us.<br>

In 2.2 when she gets tweaked a bit, we can then if needed tweak some things for more min max optimization.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>You are taking less hits, but the average damage taken per hit is lower for a druid, reducing the melee burst potential. That makes druid the preferable tank for melee that cannot crush, as long as healer mana is not an issue (because the druid will takes more damage overall).<br>

		<div id="post_message_473888"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->One consideration is the number of shaman/priest healers you have on the MT. Our MT healers were paladins with 1.6 second Holy Lights, shamans on raid, the one holy priest on OT heals. As a result uptime on ancestral fortitude/inspiration on the MT was almost non-existant. Also banking on LOH is difficult for a fight that can't be reliably one shotted. For a bear the armor buffs don't do much since they're very close to cap anyway whereas our warriors were far short of the armor cap and those buffs would make a large difference. I can see a guild that uses the opposite healing scheme as us having less problems healing a warrior. Numbers out of my ass and off the top of my head I think our warrior was at like 22-24k armor in 300 SR buffed whereas the bear was at like 29-30k or so. I think those numbers are close but I don't recall exactly.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I debated this when we tried a druid first, thinking that he should be taking less than me. 75% reduction versus 65-70, then I realized duh, defensive stance, so warriors are actually at 80ish% depending on the amount of armor buffs you have.

		<div id="post_message_473998"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Well we typically see much higher avoidance on a warrior than a feral - and you can do the math of how that scales obviously as well.  <br>
Magic damage should be obviously lower as well on a warrior.  <br>
<br>
Further the warrior will have ironshields chugged, and the feral typically isn't at 38k or whatever in decent SR.  Armor really doesn't go down for a warrior in SR.  <br>
The armor gap is typically more than compensated for.  I would simply try it both ways and parse it out.  You may find the feral works better for you because your feral is much more well geared in an SR set.  Or you might find the burst is less on a feral - and therefore use that... or you may find your healers going OOM, and you'll want a warrior.  <br>
<br>

		<div id="post_message_475147"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->We did some experimenting, and all I can say is, when you throw on shadow resist gear (even epics!), to get decent amounts of resist PLUS crit immunity, druids will either sacrifice too much stamina/armor, or too much avoidance, or a combination of both.

<br>
Any fight where there's a combination of both spell damage and physical damage, a warrior will be a better tank. Shield block, Defensive/Imp.

</div>It's not a matter of just spamming Shadow Pots and Heathstones. Every member needs to use them <i>intelligently</i>. It will click eventually, you got her to 1%, you'll do it again.  Make sure everyone understands- any attempt you can kill her, so do everything you possibly can to survive. <br>
<br>
Make sure you take a look at WWS, see who's dealing the most damage and getting teleported the least. It sounds pretty blunt, but  those people probably needs some things to be cleared. For example, are mages blinking late and on top of people? Are people running on top of a mage who just blinked? Are the rogues running back to Shahraz while others run the opposite way? etc..etc..<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Had no idea that was possible til we did it. Got a little hairy at the end, but we stayed in until the 100% buff like we usually do with resist tanks. Unfortunately no WWS for that run. ; \</div>

</div>I wouldn't go so far as to say that using the Dementia'd lifebloom was an exploit.

2k HP/S doesn't trivialize healing a fight where the mob can burst for 18k damage in 2 seconds with a melee/saberlash/melee 1-2-3 combo and healers are getting mana burned, but it helps stabilize it a bit.

</div>Uh, you definitely are going out of your way to employ the exploit. You probably wait for the druid to get the buff, and before he gets the buff he's probably not lifeblooming because he's waiting for the buff. Then once he gets the buff, he sits there and continues to keep the buff rolling while the raid gets into its shadow resist. Then you skip getting your shadow resist, despite the fact that it's better on the fight, and it would take you about 2 minutes to get it, as you've killed Illidan and could hearth to Shat then port yourself back. I also don't understand how you're going to argue that it doesn't trivialize the tank healing on the fight. Looking at your own WWS, you take 500k melee damage and the druid has 480k effective healing on you. He basically healed you by himself. The Lifebloom is also going to be more consistant than any other possible healing and is going to keep you up through the burst better than anything else.</div>

</div>Yes, it really does.<br>
<br>
With appropriate healing assignments and raid discipline, healing through that burst is already more than manageable... adding a 2k HP/S lifebloom makes it retardedly easy.<br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong, I'm certainly not accosting you for using it; if one of our druids happens to get it on the trash clear to Mother, they generally roll it. Why wouldnt you? But we certainly dont sit there and wait until a druid gets the dementia debuff before killing the mob. And it's definitely not part of our healing strategy for that boss. If anyone became reliant on it in order to kill her week to week, any nerf would see a pretty significant impact on their ability to kill the boss with any consistency.</div>

My guild has gathered enough Hearts of Darkness now for the full SR set for 25 people in the raid. However, I'm wondering how much SR people actually need and what the cap is. From my calculation, the full set + cloak (enchanted) + neck gives 366. Adding the priest SR buff to this, you have 436 but the cap is somewhere around 400 right?<br>

So basically for all casters, including healers we need the full up to the cap. The 3 tanks need what ? And the melee ?<br>

</div>With 0 SR you're looking at basically 15,000 damage in 2 seconds that stacks with every other ability she has if the MT group gets ported on (this goes for all tanks at 0 SR).  I don't see how that isn't gambling - you can easily get numbers in the 50k+ damage range taken in &lt; 3 seconds.  The armor loss with neck, cloak, bracers is less than 200, and the mitigation loss is maybe an effective percent or two - far less than the reduction from SR damage minus the burst protection.<br>
<br>
A lot of people reply to stuff with "we did it, therefore it must be okay" - or my favorite "I did this last time and it worked."  Just because you got a 4th and 17 conversion once doesn't mean its a smart idea; or even the right thing to do again (read: or that it wasn't a mistake to do in the FIRST place).  But keep on trucken w/that 0 SR   Since increasing my SR with another 2 epics, I haven't died on Mother Shahraz to any burst outside of offtanks being ported.</div>

</div>Yes, I included both options in my previous post to a maximum of 2 hours~.<br>
But it usually took about 90 minutes for a full clear of the trash 8-10 man, without rushing.<br>
The trash respawn is 2 hours as well, so it is approximately at the same time a soft-reset would happen.</div>

		<div id="post_message_479282">For anyone that cares, the way we farm trash in our push to shahraz is:<br>
<br>
We leave either bloodboil or gorefiend up after clearing hyjal and up to akama(usually tuesday).  This leaves the remaining's trash alive.  Depending on # of ppl we can either do the aoe packs to bloodboil with the 2 huge guys or do any of gorefiend's trash.  basically 2 of the 4 chains in the large center room that leads to bloodboil/akama/gorefiend/rol can be jumped up near, and you can leave 1 mob up in any pack(especially nice for aoe packs, lots of mobs, low hp, just dot em up while you kite with pack..), have everyone jump up there and it'll evade the entire pack out, reset it to full and you can farm the same pack the whole time.<br>
<br>
With a skilled walljumper(ours is named torrac!) you can actually pull any of the trash to bloodboil AND bloodboil himself without it pulling any other packs along the way.  We like the aoe packs if torrac is there because we can just tank the 2 guys with a warrior and 2 healers while a hunter and a cpl warlocks run circles around the room killing the 10 little guys that would be AOE'd.  This strategy is also particulary effective with the first pull of gorefiend trash, a warlock can get 2 seeds of corruption off and solo 3 of the 4 mobs in 14min w/ a zanza.   A hunter and extra warlocks can bring this down to about 6-7 minutes a reset.<br>
<br>
We can usually get a grp in there at any time of the day killing and resetting the trash mobs, hearts go for SR, anything else is handled by how long you've been in the grp, 1 per person until everyone gets something(be it epic or gem).</div>

</div>4 Kills sorry* Our first kill was pretty quickly too after delegating healing and finding a spot where we could avoid some randomness.

		<div id="post_message_480168">We shifted positions to a place similar to renew's based on a post in this forum.  <br>
<br>
Only for us, we draw a line along that overhang.  The melee are on the far right just where the right/eastern edge of the overhang ends.  Mother shahraz is just west of them.  The tanks are wedged against the wall about 3/4rs of the way along the wall nearer the right/east side (and facing east).  The entire raid is on the west end of the overhang/diagonal - the FA healers and 1 MT healer are positioned in the open.  <br>
<br>
We've done much better in this position, and have had probably 5-6 fold less ports on the melee than at the couch.  On the couch we would have up to 5 melee ports in ONE attempt.  On the wall the MT's get ported on once, and I can't recall the melee ever being ported directly upon.  <br>
<br>
Even if the raid gets ported on we typically survive that - it is the sinful beam combinations, and other bullshit that will basically end you.<br>
<br>
Here is a picture.<br>
<br>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080308155717im_/http://flying-hellfish.com/gallery/albums/userpics/10001/spot.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<br>
This picture was post-wipe on a double offtank port with both tank's backs turned.  So I wasn't taking it to show positioning.  The raid would be to the left of this picture, just where the wall ends in the west.  The MT positioning is shown, melee are facing them, and shahraz fits in the middle.  Between the Yellow and Green icons.  <br>
<br>
I believe this is superior to the above strategy because it places the melee closer to a wall - and the closer to a wall, the less likely you are that an FA will be placed near you.<br>
<br>
I also truly doubt anyone here blaming the RNG hasn't done everything in their power to stack against the fight.  I think the reason the above picture even exists shows that strategy is not really the issue - or 0.1 second deaths from full health due to sinful beams.  <br>
<br>
If you are wiping from FA you are almost certainly doing something wrong - but FA isn't the culprit here in making a terrible fight, at least not by itself.</div>

		<div id="post_message_480181">I'm much too lazy and it's much too late to bother with a picture or fancy diagram, but we tank her in the middle of the room, with one ranged camp in front at max range, 1 ranged camp behind at max range, and a melee camp behind her.<br>
<br>
Our first kill took us less than 4 total hours, and none of our subsequent kills have taken us longer than roughly 30 minutes of total attempts. <br>
<br>
The ONLY thing that ever really wipes us is a main tank knock up/lash.  While its annoying, its rare enough that we have seen no reason to alter our position or setup.  In 4 weeks, we've lost a grand total of 1 kill due to it.  <br>
<br>
I will admit, I'm not quite sure I see the benefit of positioning the raid in such a way that you lessen the groups and area you are able to spread to.  Perhaps it's just our luck and we are avoiding the knock ups/lash at a much higher rate than other guilds (we get knock ups with no lash, but those are inconsequential and have no real effect one way or the other), but doing a very quirky setup that limits space for the raid to move to wedge your tank in a couch or in a corner seems to simply add to the overall random luck of the encounter, not really lessen it (ports on camps happen at a higher rate than knock up/saber lash in our experience).  We do 4 total camps (2 ranged, 1 melee, 1 main tank), and ports on top of any of them are extremely trivial.  People move, healers heal, and you move on with relative ease.</div>

		<div id="post_message_480217">I am really not sold on the SR for tanks idea myself.  We have only wiped once because I died prematurely to FA damage when one of my healers was silenced, one was dead and two got ported.  I have however lived with only a couple hundred hp several times from 20k lashes so I think SR on me would actually increase our odds of a random wipe.  We could log in tomorrow and have the total opposite happen however, so that doesn't mean all that much.<br>
I tank her just around the corner in Quigons pick, maybe 1-2 yards to the north of the melee camp shown by the green triangle with my back wedged in there to avoid knockbacks, and we also have only seen a single port directly onto the tanks after 50 attempts or so.  50 attempts isn't very much, but eh, it's worth noting I guess as this is the third time someone has commented on that particular spot.  We had our raid on the opposite end, more east under the lip of a huge armchair/couch only because I didn't realize the overhang when you tank it prevents knockbacks.  Tanking in that spots definitely speeds up wipe recovery though when you only have to run 4-5 yards to leash.  I was the only one who went below 50% durability after a full 4 hour raid.<br>
<br>
I am sold on the paladin OT's however, assuming you have 8-9 healers or so.  Aside from them always being at full mana despite group composition, and the constant judgements, you can put your two real OT's on dps duty which significantly increases dps and reduces the time available for stupid things to happen.<br>
<br>
<br>
As for the trash, we farmed about 100 hearts on a Fri/Sat after our first RoS kill Thursday by simply offering people dkp for going on runs and free random rolls on gems/epics.  The bank paid any willing paladin to respec prot and aoe tank the group pulls (made 9 man runs 100x easier then anyone else trying to tank them).  Our runs were 30-50m depending on how many people showed up.  It really just comes down to knowing how to pull everything properly with so fer people and it goes really fast once you master that.</div>

</div>I am pretty sure our melee hug the wall more as you mentioned. I made the diagram after our first kill so people could see what's up with the fight and for people who might have to lead the raid if I miss a night.<br>
<br>
We survive melee and raid ports without issues usually, people are just really solid about spreading out asap.<br>
<br>
As far as SR, our feral druid said the same thing, but I pretty much did not agree with wearing 0 SR for a little bit more stats. Resist gear has immense mitigation, her melee will not kill you, her shadow damage will, especially as a Druid. Trust me, you do not give up much for a huge amount of magical mitigation. Looking at my SCT everytime I am ported, have people port near me, or am in an arena cheesing a shadow based team, the mitigation is HUGE.</div>

</div>The idea sells itself:<br>
<br>
Max burst potential (barring OT ports which can happen):<br>
Melee - parry - melee (common*): 6k + 6k (uncommon that both hit)<br>
Saber Lash ~ 7k<br>
<br>
*Because weapon skill is broken (for parry) all of your attacks parry about 10% of the time.  With a 1.5 weapon (assuming you use GoA!) and a 1.5 GCD you get roughly 13 attacks in 10 seconds, for roughly 1 parry in 10 seconds, for roughly 1 parry for every 3-4 natural shahraz swings (lets say 5 though).  It is extremely common, check your logs.  You'll double parry her every kill (defined as melee-parry-melee-parry-melee, not melee-parry,parry-melee), and triple parry a couple times generally.  <br>
<br>
SR items:<br>
Sinful beam: 6700 (improved defensive stance from 8000 unmitigated, recursive)<br>
Fatal attraction: ~7600 (1.0), ~15200 (2.0), ~22800 (3.0) (3000 per player, 3 players, mitigated with improved defensive stance)<br>
<br>
In 2.0 seconds with FA up you're looking with "0" SR roughly 40.9 max burst in 2.0 seconds, 48.5 in 3.0 seconds.<br>
<br>
A more realistic number in 2.0 seconds after an FA might be closer to 29,000 taken - but that is just with a saber lash, melee hit, and 16k in FA damage, no beam, no parry, no third tick from anyone - all of which can happen.  You're already over the cap - anything that can theoretically kill you in 2.0 seconds should be considered unhealable.  You can use oh-shit abilities for this situation, but again, we're gambling because you're ignoring beams, parries, and additional FA ticks.  Even a vile beam is going to be killer.  <br>
<br>
The one time I tried using 0 SR this exact scenario happened - unfortunately this was a while ago and the WWS of the experience expired (I have the URL if that matters for anyone who can extract the old log) - but we had 0 deaths at 20% and I needlessly died to beam + FA in under a second.  <br>
<br>
So in 0 SR (I know its really 70):<br>
<br>
Max burst in 2.0 seconds ~ 40.9k (22k from SR) - maybe a few resists for 37-41ish<br>
In MAX SR in 2.0 seconds ~ 25k (~6k from SR) - maybe less resists for 27-29ish<br>
<br>
Let's also remember that overall a tank will take anywhere between 10 and 30% of the total damage from shadow damage.  Knocking your damage down anywhere from 7 to 21% of the total from 3-4 epics?  <br>
<br>
Now I know these burst numbers seem absurd, but they can and will eventually happen.  But it is mostly about how you are so far beyond dead in the "worst case" scenario with 0 SR that even if it isn't remotely a worst-case you are still going to die more than you should.  Since increasing my SR I personally have not died outside of offtanks being ported.  <br>
<br>
Your job as a tank is to decrease your chance of being gibbed instantly - a 0 SR tank is like an avoidance tank with low HP.  You're sacrificing "armor" (in this case resist gear, guaranteed reduction of damage - and yes it IS guaranteed to not get a 0 resist past like 180ish SR, and the odds for 25% go to almost nothing beyond that).  You sacrifice that "armor" (SR) for avoidance... its just a stupid tanking mistake.  The mob will eventually get lucky, and it is YOUR fault you weren't wearing enough HP/armor[SR].  In this case your HP cannot compensate for the loss of SR mitigation in even a semi-bad scenario.  <br>
<br>
Further, I'm fairly certain the overall fight mitigation is lower in 0 SR.  <br>
In a recent WWS with only 205 SR, I mitigate off 9% of the total damage she put out on me.  This could readily be increased to 13.5% reduction with the gear I wear now.  <br>
At the time, that 205 SR was achieved by wearing 3 pieces of gear, losing less than 100 armor, and roughly 2% dodge.  At about 50% avoidance that is roughly a 4% improvement in damage reduction - not even remotely close to what I gained from the SR.  This becomes worse with a druid by just over 1000 hp... read: the RNG has 1000 more ways to get lucky on you as a druid in 0 SR.  Once you theoretically over-the-top the HP dam you really are on borrowed time - as you get further over you rapidly diminish your chances, regardless of the base.  <br>
<br>
In what way, whatsoever, is 0 SR superior?</div>

		<div id="post_message_480307">Using 0 SR is a rather bad idea. Once you get the healing figured out, what kills you is a bad FA port either on the raid (1 camp method) or port on your tank. I can survive a port on me, but its really rough with 220SR. Using 0 I might as well bend over and get ready for it. It's a really dumb risk and if you're smart about it, you don't sacrifice much in stats/avoidance with SR. What pieces of gear do you "need" to not use 3 pieces of SR? I guess it will just take a sub 20% FA port on the tanks to change your mind though. You'll end up telling yourself how much stupid luck that was and realize you could have likely survived it with some resist on.</div>

		<div id="post_message_480904">I see what you're saying, I didn't realize that. In this case you would have one super clump with pretty much the entire raid in it. Still, I don't think putting everyone up against the wall actually reduces your chance for a port on the raid. Like I said, you reduce the available teleport space by 40-50% so you're increasing the odds of any spot in the open area getting a port by an inverse amount. By being up against the wall you reduce the space around the raid by 50% also, so the values should roughly cancel out unless I'm missing some aspects to it. This compared to tanking out in the open with the entire raid standing just outside of silence range would accomplish nearly the same thing no? Except the odds of the port being near a wall are increased, and wall ports tend to be more difficult for people to escape from.<br>
<br>
I don't know for a fact what I'm saying is true. I haven't done any calculations or any crazy maths or whatever, but it seems to me to make sense. Just idle theorycraft I suppose as hopefully the nerfstick will be coming will be coming shortly and it will be a non issue. The way I look at is, I think of everything as a circle. The potential teleport area is a circle around Shahraz. The "area of influence" of a port is a circle around where the people get ported. The "area of influence" where the raid gets the effects of a port is a circle around the raid, well actually a circle around any clumps you might be using. Intersection of these circles causes bad results. Putting the circle near a wall cuts off roughly half the circle.</div>

We had problems whenever we tanked her near a wall, where it was providing alot of problems when people get teleported to a wall close to either of the groups.<br>

Our safest way sofar was when we had alot of space either side of our ranged group and teleports gave us less issues.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Uh, you definitely are going out of your way to employ the exploit. You probably wait for the druid to get the buff, and before he gets the buff he's probably not lifeblooming because he's waiting for the buff. Then once he gets the buff, he sits there and continues to keep the buff rolling while the raid gets into its shadow resist. Then you skip getting your shadow resist, despite the fact that it's better on the fight, and it would take you about 2 minutes to get it, as you've killed Illidan and could hearth to Shat then port yourself back. I also don't understand how you're going to argue that it doesn't trivialize the tank healing on the fight. Looking at your own WWS, you take 500k melee damage and the druid has 480k effective healing on you. He basically healed you by himself. The Lifebloom is also going to be more consistant than any other possible healing and is going to keep you up through the burst better than anything else.</div>

</div>That's a lot of probably.<br>
<br>
We didn't kill the trash any differently than usual. This was the first time that Druid used the Dementia's Lifebloom and without Dementia'd lifebloom he typically puts about 300k healing into me. The 480k you quote isn't effective, its pure output. We still ran with 2 full time healers on me, no different than usual, except one had less effective healing than usual. And you're right, I coulda gone back to get my SR gear but part of me wanted to try the fight with just the SR buff and like I said, i was tired as hell that night and just wanted to be done raiding ASAP. <br>
<br>
I could really care less if they take Dementia'd Lifebloom out, the fight might go back to taking more than one attempt, but in 2.2 it will be even easier than it is now with Dementia'd Lifebloom. For the sake of my repair bills and moderating my frustration with Blizzard I hope we keep using Dementia until they take it out. <br>
<br>
BTW-This thread has a bunch of WWS I've posted for this fight if you'd care to provide something more than conjecture in your future posts.</div>

<br>
As I've geared up to ridiculous levels for the fight, tank healing has become all but a joke, I used to drop sub 1k a few times a kill, this last kill I don't think I dropped under 5k once, including a couple ports near me (219 SR because I'm not risking it)<br>
<br>
We have had a few times when I've been punted and lashed, but I think it was once while learning, once sometime a while back, and once two weeks ago, the one two weeks ago was the only really frustrating time since it was at like 20% on what would have been a kill.  (Side note I parried the lash on knockback at 10% the next pull for a kill)  Maybe we had the wrong spot on the wall but slow attrition from someone being a retard seemed to be a bigger issue than what comes down to a very rare occurance of me getting gibbed in the air.</div>

		<div id="post_message_481964">Your math for proving that SR on tanks is sound, if your only goal is to not wipe when people get ported on the tanks.  From several peoples experience with that spot, including ours, people just don't get ported onto that spot often enough to warrant me potentially dying from the myriad of other things I have otherwise lived through because I was not wearing shadow resist gear.  I've eaten at least 4 19-20k lashes without dying in our attempts when OT's were ported or knocked or when I got knocked myself and stuck up on the wall for 10s because I was bad at camera angles.  I've lived with &lt;1k hp 2-3 times as well when all of my healers were ported or silenced or whatever reason.  Most of those narrow escapes would have been a wipe if I put on even 3 pieces of SR gear, as I'd lose well over 1k hp and several % avoidance.  Warriors clearly don't lose as much from SR gear as druids do though.<br>
The way I see the fight in it's current form, there are a number of things that will wipe the raid regardless of how you play.  People getting ported on tanks with no SR is far less common then a number of other things that are being avoided without SR, so we just eat a wipe when it happens (only once in maybe 50 so far) and laugh it off.<br>
Just for reference, we have used three snake traps at all times while learning the encounter to give people more chance to get used to it without wiping us repeatedly.  It's much easier to get your bearings your first port when it's just 2 of you.  I'm currently at 24-25k buffed depending on what I wear and while the damage is definitely increased, it's been worth it for more time spent learning to handle FA rather then recovering from a leash/wipe.  If I ever die from standard incoming damage, I might change my mind but right now snakes are a useful learning tool.<br>
The other thing is, due to the changes of the beams and FA next patch there is even less need for SR on the tanks, so why bother crafting them for 2 more people now who won't need it later if you are hurting for hearts as it is.  Of course, by the time the patch actually comes out we'll have more hearts then we know what to do with and the point will be mute, but for guilds getting to her just now it's semi-valid.<br>
<br>
Using snakes and no SR on tanks has in my opinion hastening our learning the boss in the time spent and lowered the total time spent to kill her.</div>

		<div id="post_message_481971">Personally I'm never comfortable with a strat that has a basic "you lose" chance.  0 SR means you lose if you get a 3-port on the MT, pretty much.  I'm not really sure why you wouldn't use at least some SR as a warrior.  The gear is ilvl 130 and has high stamina.  You perhaps lose a bit of avoidance but in many cases unless you somehow have full BT/Hyjal tank gear in every slot you may be gaining armor and breaking even on hp by using SR.  A few % lower avoidance isn't going to make or break your attempt, but 230ish SR vs. 0 is a massive difference.<br>

But eh, whatever works for you.  If you can walk in and one-shot the fight every week, then keep doing what you're doing.  If not, then maybe you should consider some tweaks.</div>

If I lose that much armor, we may as well change to a warrior tank since half the benefit of me tanking is freeing up the shamans to spam chain heal without worrying about ancestral fort.  <br>
I'm not comfortable with any strat that has any "you lose" factor in it either, but I'm also not comfortable learning a boss that is so horribly designed that every single aspect of the fight is about to be changed any day now.  Granted I've been saying that for almost two months, and had we gotten to Shahraz sooner then a week ago I would probably have a different opinion.  <br>
If I saw tanks needing SR even after patch, then we'd just switch to a warrior tank and give him SR, but the inability to be hit by beams and the heavily nerfed FA damage won't be harmful to a tank then even without any SR.<br>
The benefit from having me tank far outweighs the occasional "you lose" factor that is present without a warrior SR tank until next patch.  This is of course assuming the patch is around the corner.  It's really just a gamble that it will come out soon.</div>

Looking at your armory if you used neck/cloak/bracers like most MTs are suggesting you'd actually gain stamina and maybe lose 1000 armor.  1000 armor vs +135 shadow resist the choice is obvious.  Its not just FA ports she sinful beams the fuck out of the MT too sometimes.  <br>
<br>
You're right sometimes you get lucky and don't need it, but when the tradeoff is so small (much smaller than you make it out to be) you really should be doing it.<br>
<br>
P.S.  Post a WWS of the kill when you get the chance I'm interested to compare overall damage, average melee hits, etc </div>

		<div id="post_message_482150">First of all, your experiences don't seem to be even close to mine.  I see FA ports on or near the tank FAR more often than I take single tank lashes.  I've only ever once had a 1 tank lash that wasn't our fault or from being knocked in the air.  With no snake traps and no OT's attacking her melee is rarely that close to fatal, and I'm somewhat curious how often your "live with 1k hp" scenario's involve either a beam or a FA not on you but near enough that you take damage.  I did a quick armory though and could see how you'd have to lose a good bit to get SR on since you appear to be just barely crit immune, so you'd have to swap other items to get defense, which is a much bigger reason not to wear it.<br>
<br>
<br>
I'd also suggest wearing SR after the patch as well, and probably will myself, because it's still additional burst on the tank in a fight that can still hurt in melee (even a reduced damage port combo'd with a melee/lash/melee is going to hurt)</div>

</div>Hmm good question about parry, now that you mention it I'm not sure if it was slated for 2.2 or not.<br>
<br>
You're right crit immunity would be a bitch for you and having to swap out important pieces (legs/boots) for SR isn't a great option.  You could probably get away using defense trinkets instead bb/hydross to get capped.</div>

		<div id="post_message_482675">Fixing the parry mechanic for this fight could quite possibly be the best thing they can do to help the randomness, aside from the obvious meele stacking issue. Most FA ports you can deal with and can come out alive as long as people are smart about moving and especially about taking healthstones/pots when they need to. Last night we saw mother turn to the meele for 3-4 seconds, I dont know why she does this but it seems to happen on quite a few mobs. Needless to say our tank took 24k spike damage in 1.7 seconds. That was a fun wipe.<br>
<br>
Do most guilds find themselves using COR on Mother? I figured the faster it is to kill her the better, just a matter of time before some random bullshit like that happens so you might as well get her down fast. <br>
<br>
Oh yeah we had a feral druid tank our first kill and a warriort anking the second, both with around 250 buffed shadow resist. They took off 2 pieces of shadow resist gear so they were mixing the BT/Hyjal tanking gear and the shadow resist, we found that healing the druid was much much easier and lived through spikes which would have potentially killed our warrior MT.</div>

</div>Seriously, are people here without even looking at something as simple as a damage meter or WWS? Bets are your shadow DPSers are each doing less shadow DPS than the MT DPS. Certainly you're bringing more physical DPS than shadow DPS (probably 3-4 times, even)? Bets are your non-MT, physical DPS are doing a MINIMUM of triple the DPS as any one shadow DPS.<br>

		<div id="post_message_483502">We just started doing this fight finally after farming up the SR. I really do wish they'd clarify in the patch notes for 2.2 what is going on with the parry mechanic. Fortunately we've found that threat in this fight is so easy thus far that both me and the druid we've tried have been able to shut off their autoattack a good way into the fight just for additional safety.<br>
<br>
Its nice that you can work around it, but it really shouldn't be there.... Its kinda sad but even the extra power we'd get from our tank and two offtanks attacking/judging would make a notable difference. Even killing this cheap demon hooker 10 seconds faster makes that roulette wheel a bit safer.....<br>
<br>
We've also found that a warrior with ironshields works better then a druid. The damage difference taken isn't huge physically under those conditions, but the warrior takes the magic better along with Last Stand/Shield Wall to just be a leg up. If you're not into dumping all those ironshields in though, I wouldn't even consider a warrior tank.<br>
<br>
If only there was some way to remove the last little killer, repeated ports into large groups of people. We've actually managed to deal with a port into the DPS and into the ranged, but its just so draining and if it happens again thats really the nail in the coffin. My personal view as a game programmer in training is that any fight where a group can do everything perfectly and meet all statistical requirements yet still lose is just poor design. Luck does not make something harder, it just makes it frusterating.</div>

We haven't had issues yet with ports on the raid / tanks, but it might be because we bring 10 healers to Mother. I think that the only RNG issue we could have now is just mass mana burns on the raid...</div>

On the current PTR notes however neither of the last 2 changes are posted, so its a pretty safe guess that these wont be implemented in 2.2, let alone anytime soon.</div>

		<div id="post_message_483616">There are reasons to use CoS or CoE instead of CoR even in a melee heavy raid, we did this for a long time and are only now starting to use CoR.  It may have been better but if your tank is just barely at the point of having this possible, CoR can be a very bad idea.<br>
<br>
As a reference, we ran with 2 resto shamans and 1 holy priest for a long time on this fight, the 25% armor buff was a gift to get it but nothing I could rely on if we wanted decent raid healing.  We didn't do tank loot distribution ideally before Shahraz, and I was consistently getting smashed to sub 1k hp from just a little shadow damage thrown in during a melee/lash/melee period.<br>
<br>
If you've got the healing so that your tank isn't at a risk of dieing, CoR is far far better, but if you're still worrying about keeping the tank up, you can last through a longer fight.  (Many of our fights have been 8 minutes and longer)<br>
<br>
Yes, once you've got a solid setup and everything is great, CoR is great, we had our fastest kill ever this week with CoR up and 5 shamans in the raid (4 resto 1 enhance, usually had 2 resto 1 enhance) without me dropping below 4k hp, but I don't think I would have wanted it up a month and a half ago.</div>

		<div id="post_message_483630">A trick we use is having Resto Shamans spam Rank 1 Healing Wave with Totem of the Maelstrom whenever they have a spare global cooldown (i.e. raid is topped off).  This provides a bit of MT healing (bugged Healing Way woo) and seriously increases the Inspiration/Ancestral Fortitude uptime.  Like so:<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304071905/http://wowwebstats.com/3xsukdcwl1i2o?s=6134-6564&amp;a=73" target="_blank">Ghando - WWS</a><br>
<br>
Note the 460 average on Healing Wave...my only other Healing Wave use was a single max-rank NS heal.  Even so, there's about 20,000 effective healing on the MT from Rank 1 spam.  The other Resto Shamans didn't spam Rank 1 nearly as much as I did (bunch of slackers), but it definitely helps with MT healing.</div>

		<div id="post_message_483648">Not extremely relevant to the current issues being discussed but I feel inclined to ask anyways because we have been having major disagreements within the guild about this. We got our first Shahraz Kill last night and on our kill attempts we couldn't have gotten luckier. Perhaps one port that barely edged the melee and one port that hit our single camp ranged group pretty solid but at that point the boss was at 5% and somehow we miraculously all still had mana. The stars just aligned for that one attempt. Sure enough, we got back for a second kill and get a full night of wipes. Our luck seemed extremely bad but we had attempts that were definitely good enough yet people died to FA on 3 ports and YES, bevlieve it or not, even 2 ports. Which is just ridiculous imo. <br>
<br>
We use the scatter method, We used to have the whole raid plus shahraz facing west and everyone would be facing west when they got ported every single time no questions asked. We told them to mix it up and not always run forward, like they should run SW, E, etc. It worked fairly well until we had like 10 attempts in a row with the worst FA ports ever. We moved the raid to a pillar, keeping her in the center in order to reduce the area around us that would effect our single ranged camp. Also to mix it up a little we kept healers and a few mages and what not facing in different directions for the whole fight, like maybe having their back to the boss facing against a wall. That way we figured they could just run straight when they get ported. Sure enough, healers started facing different directions after getting ported then they were beforehand. I am quite certain that almost all the ports were facing SW or W which was always the way Shahraz was facing. <br>
<br>
I am now quite convinced that she always ports you facing the way she is facing. The other officers were just insisting there was no rhyme or reason to it and its pointless to try and figure out. Even if we use the scatter strat though, people just seemed to be completely confused and almost stopping altogether not realizing what way they were facing because before they could expect to always face west but not necessarily anymore.<br>
<br>
I read through most of the post and I apologize if this question was already answered, I must have missed it somewhere.</div>

</div>Yeah, a decent portion of our success with the fight (8 pulls total for our last 6 kills combined) is definitely attributable to bringing a lot of healers.  We put 2 resto druids and 2 paladins, or 1 resto druid and 3 paladins, depending on composition, on the MT.  Two others stand a bit off to either side of the raid and have the priority of (ported people &gt; assigned Lash OT &gt; raid healing), and everyone else just heals the raid.   Priority #1 is just making sure the MT never dies.  You can recover from anything else, even 6-8 deaths to a horrible port, but not from your MT dying.<br>

		<div id="post_message_484351">Yes Ghando, like I said we use CoR now, it was great this week, and it's certainly a valuable curse (In fact we had a rogue hit like 1700 dps or so on Shahraz this week because of how our raid was setup) but on many earlier kills, it wasn't worth the risk.  We had 2 shamans who were hitting me with small heals whenever they could to help with ancestral healing but they didn't have many free GCD's (Though it might work to say it's our healing strategy that wasn't ideal) and it just wasn't up enough to justify CoR killing me on combos where I lived with 400 hp.<br>
<br>
I still very highly recommend CoR, but in some situations I'm just saying it's not stupid to not use it.  If your tank is just barely geared (like I was when we were first doing Shahraz) and you're not getting a very high up time on ancestral healing, it can be dangerous, and I'd really suggest asking your tank what he thinks (FWIW I was recommending CoR a few weeks before we did start using it, but for our first few kills I do think it would have wiped us plenty)<br>
<br>
Then again, maybe I'm skewed in opinion because we don't seem to get too many just terrible ports since we tank in the middle, and she very rarely likes to do a knock up saber lash on me.</div>

		<div id="post_message_484680">There are two major factors that make this fight considerably easier. <br>
<br>
First is to use Los since mother cannot port people to a place she cannot see, they are safe from being ported onto too, as well she cannot directly target those people with beams.<br>
<br>
Second is a odd mechanic, for Fa portals the spot she chooses will randomly be along a direct path or line from herself to anyone she can see. Limit FA portal positions by knowing this and using LOS makes this fight a tonne easier. <br>
<br>
Working from just these 2 principles a good guild should be able to limit the 'randomness' and 'bad ports'. We beat her with just 2.5 nights spent using this and other strategic moves into what is now a very easy fight.</div>

We are running the eggs in one basket strat tanking her in the middle of the path &amp; raid hugging the pillar on the left facing Mother.<br>
<br>
We had nothing but  chain FA ports on the raid and tank constantly throughout the night, it seemed with more and more practice at it the more survivable it was. I think we had about 3 strong attempts where we had 2 FA ports on the raid, and on our kill had 2 on the tank and 1 on the raid.<br>
<br>
Im not sure if is the amount of healers we run for Mother (11 including the 2 pally offtanks) that makes it so much more forgiving, albiet we still wipe to some ports for whatever reason, but it seems my experience with the bad FA's are somewhat different to alot of other raiders around this site, food for thought.</div>

I think another significant change that 2.2 will bring will be the huge drop in the mana strain of this fight. Firstly, less FA damage, especially on bad ports (assuming people play smart). Secondly, the fight goes much faster with each caster pulling at least an additional 300dps. Thirdly and something not mentioned much yet, are shadow priests actually regenerating respectable amounts of mana, rather than the paltry joke it is at the moment.</div>

"Mother Shahraz<br>
- The players targeted by Saber Lash now gain the immunity to Sinister Beam and Fatal Attraction, regardless of whether or not Saber Lash actually landed.<br>
<b>- Shahraz will now pick a new beam to cast after every 3rd cast, instead of every 5th.</b><br>
- The first two seconds of Fatal Attraction now deals reduced damage.<br>

So either every set of beams was a chain (of 5) and now a set of 3 is not considered a chain at all, or there was something done to Wicked beam im unaware of? thats what I was asking.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">There are two major factors that make this fight considerably easier. <br>
<br>
First is to use Los since mother cannot port people to a place she cannot see, they are safe from being ported onto too, as well she cannot directly target those people with beams.<br>
<br>
Second is a odd mechanic, for Fa portals the spot she chooses will randomly be along a direct path or line from herself to anyone she can see. Limit FA portal positions by knowing this and using LOS makes this fight a tonne easier. </div>

</div>Chains do bounce, but having healers inside the los at max healing range means they take none of the beams whatsoever since they are out of range of any chains that could possibly hit them. The only time 1 chain could get to them is if someone was careless in running to that group and had a chain hit them at the time.<br>
<br>
As for the Fa portal mechanic, having tested this on raids, its consistant. The fa portal path is any line from point 1 being herself and the 2nd point being anyone she can see, now draw a line connecting those 2 dots and run it till that line connects with a wall either way, that is the possible path for fa ports. Remember that pets, totems,  and people count for any of those targets.<br>
<br>
Something other players have noticed  but not verified is if somone was parked  at spot X at the start of the fight or on first FA, the game seems to keep that spot or path marked even though someone has moved from it, thus perodic ports to  no one on the current line, but from people that were there previously.<br>
<br>
These two things do help a guild learn the encounter and the patch soon will make this fight easier as well but this takes some of the edge off the fight since you can 100% protect your mt healers from Fa's ported onto them and eliminate chains on them. Whether  you take use this and have your range dodge the fa portals is another question and possibly bad since you thus eliminate visable targets for her to port along a path with the greater chance of it being ontop of the melee/mt. Thus we keep Range outside the los box visable but  alert to move into LOS to dodge fa ports when they are incoming with seem to be on a 18-25 sec window.</div>

		<div id="post_message_485329">It's not just that clumping reduces the chance of extra FA damage.  Clumping is also desirable because it ensures everyone will be in healing range of everyone else 100% of the time, and most importantly clumping really lets Chain Heal work its magic.  In my mind that's a convincing argument for the 1-camp strategy in itself, but obviously your mileage may vary and plenty of people have success with more camps.</div>

</div>That's wrong. Definitely. We have a very basic positionning for shahraz : everyone is in the middle "normal" path aligned like this :<br>
<br>
Tanks &lt;=&gt; Shahraz &lt;=&gt; Melee &lt;=====&gt; Ranged/Healers &lt;========&gt; Where she stands before pull.<br>
<br>
And we regularly see FA ports far behind the tanks, far behind the ranged camp or along the walls on each side.<br>
<br>
Afaik, FA port destination is just a random around her, nothing more than that.</div>

		<div id="post_message_485337">I find it really hard to see the line theory working in practice as well.<br>
<br>
We keep the ranged in a clump to one side, tanks in front, melee behind, that should leave about 3 lines.  However, just in the last kill I can remember people ported behind the tanks and to the side, with no one being along that line, though it's possible if you take it as a full line going both ways a melee was at that angle, but more solidly I've seen people ported behind the melee and to the side, that isn't along a line to where anyone stands or where anyone has been throughout the fight unless counting where they ran with FA.<br>
<br>
My experiences don't fit with the line idea, and if it's forcing it by saying along a line anywhere someone's been, FA movements more or less make that not matter because people can't just always do the same thing with FA.</div>

		<div id="post_message_485350">Actually what you just stated supports this mechanic, as we tested to see if this works as well and we were able to set paths up for Fas.Remeber at the start of the fight even on aggro it seems, people out in the open can seemingly trigger or mark areas, thus why we hide our range group etc in los where she cannot port too until she is is set up in her mt position and range healers are already in their safe los spot.<br>
<br>
I may not be coming across clearly to some as i had problems getting it across in raids until i actually set it up and showed the mechanic and was able to direct or predict where the ports where to be.<br>
<br>
To test this we set up a letter V in the middle of the wallkway, with the tank at the apex of the V and 2 range groups split up at the top of each line of that V shape. Now if you carry 1 side of the V with a imaginary line past the mt  until it intersects with the wall.. either wall, that is a possible path of ports. You cant set up where Fa ports will be along this path but knowing where this will be helps. <br>
<br>
<b>Almost all ports go out into open space for us, and some where no one is standing</b>~ correct, it doesnt mean it will be on somone standing in a spot, but if you draw a line across 2 dots and extend those lines further,  with 1 dot being the Boss and the 2nd dot being anyone, there is where your ports could possibly be anywhere along that line.<br>
<br>
<b>Tanks &lt;=&gt; Shahraz &lt;=&gt; Melee &lt;=====&gt; Ranged/Healers &lt;========&gt; Where she stands before pull.And we regularly see FA ports far behind the tanks, far behind the ranged camp</b><br>
<br>
As you outlined above with the line in the middle, this is correct as you said u saw ports behind the tanks or range camp as this is a direct line across all of them. As to the ports along the side, i really dont know how to account for that unless somone wasnt stacked properly attacking from a angle or totems were slightly off stack and set up a new path thus along the wall.<br>
<br>
Changing  mt position in our strat to utilize LOS  and using the above we have basically 2 fa portal spots now which are both in range of the FA healer which makes the fight even before the patch completely ez mode.<br>
<br>
This thing in entirely is very easy to replicate, stack 1 main group with  your mt out infront and pull the boss to you with no one, totems or pets etc off to the side and watch where the fa ports fall in line. They should 90% or better fall on that axis that connects  the raid group and the mt with ports being on that line anywhere from past the mt and behind the main raid stack and anywhere inbetween. Just remember the line connecting the 2 points doesnt stop at the points, but extends past them as well, the longer your axis length, the better chance your ports can be from the main group as what spot it picks along that path is totally random.</div>

With 2.5 nights spent on her and half of that running around trying various tank spots (huge waste of time), the fight wasnt nearly as hard as what i had heard it was going to be.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">It's not just that clumping reduces the chance of extra FA damage.  Clumping is also desirable because it ensures everyone will be in healing range of everyone else 100% of the time, and most importantly clumping really lets Chain Heal work its magic.  In my mind that's a convincing argument for the 1-camp strategy in itself, but obviously your mileage may vary and plenty of people have success with more camps.</div>

I couldn't disagree with this more.  1 ranged camp provides 0 benefit over 2 ranged camps while adding several degrees of difficulty to the encounter.  One group simply increases the impact of mana drain, and makes an FA port onto the group a more difficult thing to deal with, while adding 0 tangible benefit.  A port on the group may be less frequent, but the fact that one single port has the potential to cause serious damage in a 1 group setup negates this as being any kind of an advantage. <br>
<br>
2 ranged camps makes FA ports essentially trivial (they probably are with the 1 camp strategy as well, I just can't imagine it being as easy to survive a bad luck scenario) , still ensures everyone will be in healing range (assuming you have proper positioning with all groups), makes mana burn less of an issue, and actually makes chain heal MORE effective, as the targets aren't spread so thin (assuming you have 2 resto shaman, you go from 20 ranged targets it can bounce to to 10).  It does all of this, mind you, while allowing people who are ported more freedom to run with FA, because no matter where they go in the entire room now, they will have healers in range, something that isn't possible with a 1 camp strategy.</div>

Second, I think with one ranged camp you want single healers off to the sides to handle FA.  Our setup basically looks like a square, with our entire ranged camp and Shahraz/melee/tanks diagonally opposite from each other, and then a single healer at each of the other two corners of the square to handle FA ports on those sides.

</div>The benefit isn't having less people to hop to, it's having less people to handle casting it on in the first place.  I've yet to find the healer that tells me they are better at handling 20 healing targets than they are 10.<br>
<br>
Also, I still fail to see a single benefit of setting it up with a single stack, even as you describe it.  You simply gain nothing.  Setting healers off to the side and spreading them out some only makes this sound significantly worse to me- now, not only have you negated the only possible benefit of a single stack (limiting the chances of an FA port on top of people), but you've done nothing to negate the main negative aspect of it (an FA port landing directly on top of essentially the entire raid).  <br>
<br>
The question in my mind is why bother with doing it this way when 2 ranged camps gives you everything you get out of 1 camp, while taking the possibility of random bad luck out of the equation?  Simply saying that you've done it that way before doesn't answer the question of what benefit it brings (we've still only experienced 1 knock up/insta-gib ever, so I fail to see this is a viable defense for it, unless our luck is simply off the charts).  <br>
<br>
To be fair, most guilds find there setup and stick with it once the kinks are worked out.  People are stubborn to change something that has worked in the past, and that is understandable.  However, throughout this entire thread, I struggle to find instances of people complaining that the multiple ranged camp setup is screwing them, and have found numerous instances of people complaining about the RNG wiping them with the 1 camp approach.  This is all beyond moot come Tuesday, but it's still peculiar none the less.<br>
<br>
You say it works well, but finding what works well is rarely the point.  Finding what works BEST is generally the goal.  In this case, what works best, to me, is the strategy that relies on skill, and not the RNG (as a disclaimer, we've never thought the 1 stack strategy was reliable or sound  and thus never tried it on any of our kills, so my comments are based strictly on my own knowledge of the fight based on our setup and what I have read from other guilds in this thread).</div>

		<div id="post_message_485761">We've been working on Mother for a few days now, and the sheer randomness and stupidity of the fight just astounds me. It makes me want to cry, claw my eyes out with an ice pick, and watch paint dry all at the same time, for that would probably make me want to end my life less than the Mother encounter. Sorry for the personal rant.<br>
<br>
My question though is (and this may, hopefully, change in 2.2), do guilds that have Mother on complete farm (EJ, Titan are guild tags I see on here often) even tend to wipe on her several times a clear due to stupid random elements, e.g. 3 tank healers being ported right on top of the MT (was my favorite random wipe of the past few nights)? Or once you get it down, does it seem to come easier the following weeks like most, if not all, boss encounters do?<br>
<br>
Yeah, we had a lot of what seemed like random wipes the past few nights. But, I was just wondering if it really was randomness, or people not playing well. I tend to lean toward the prior, and hope to chalk the 30% and less wipes to just dumb luck. Is the randomness avoidable to a certain extent, once you get the fight more mastered?</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">It feels easier each week off course, but we never one shoted her though (but many guilds do). Usually, we kill her in the 3-5 first attempts, so it's ok for us. We aren't probably using the best strat (in terms of positionning) but well, aslong as she dies before trash respawn, it's good enough for me, especially since massive nerf is incoming. And well, when you only have content for 2 raids nights per week, wasting 1 hour on a boss isn't so bad..</div>

</div>For a while we were using the 3 ranged camp positioning, but we have since moved to the ranged camp&gt; melee camp &gt; tank all in a line, with 2-3 healers out to the sides healing FA. It seemed like it worked a lot better, and residual damage from FA was basically down to 0. That is of course until the last few attempts of the night when it seemed every FA spawned in some camp, which I guess is just one of the downfalls of the 'line' strat. It did feel as if she could have died on any attempt, and bad luck just got us, but maybe I am just trying to be optimistic. Let's just hope she dies tonight, eh?<br>
<br>
On a side note, thank god she can be leashed. I'm not sure if I could make that run as often as we have wiped on her. Granted, it's no pre-portal C'thun or even post-portal Emp run, but still bad.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">You say it works well, but finding what works well is rarely the point.  Finding what works BEST is generally the goal.  In this case, what works best, to me, is the strategy that relies on skill, and not the RNG (as a disclaimer, we've never thought the 1 stack strategy was reliable or sound  and thus never tried it on any of our kills, so my comments are based strictly on my own knowledge of the fight based on our setup and what I have read from other guilds in this thread).</div>

</div>The other main benefit is that it frees up much more space for ported people to run.  Yes, a port directly onto the raid hurts, and if you get too many of them you'll wipe.  But we've had 3 ports onto our ranged stack in one attempt and still one-shotted her (this past week, actually).  Now of course if she ported directly onto our stack 3-4 times in a row, I don't think we could recover from that, but that's extraordinarily unlikely.  But I think that when people get ported, they're understandably hesitant to run into a large crowd of people, which leads the ported people to tend to clump more and for longer than is healthy or perhaps even survivable.  In my experience a port on the melee hurts but isn't that big a deal.  But a port into the space between the melee and the closest wall tends to be more likely to result in deaths, because no one wants to run directly into the melee clump while they have FA, so spreading quickly is less likely to happen.  With one ranged clump there's much much more totally open space and not only are people less likely to land ON a camp, but they're less likely to land in a position where their movement is restricted by their proximity to a camp.<br>
<br>
I know I've bragged about this a few times already, but my evidence that a one-camp strat isn't overly susceptible to the RNG, or that if it is we are extraordinarily lucky (and I don't think we are), is that, looking at our guild WWS page, we have leashed Shahraz once after 2m16s on Aug 11th and once after 1m43s on Aug 18th.  Every other time we have aggroed her since July, she has died.  That doesn't strike me as a strat that puts your hands in the RNG.</div>

I'm with Gurg on this one, if it was *THAT* random people wouldn't be doing the 1 camp method and they certainly wouldn't be 1-shot or nearly 1-shotting her weekly.  We've had less than 10 wipes in our 6 kills of her.<br>

		<div id="post_message_486003">It really does get easier, I don't think I can quite put it at as good as Gurgthock is saying for us, but we haven't had more than a couple wipes on her for a long time.  With several one shots in the past few months.  Personally I feel the biggest difference is having the tank just not be a concern on healing anymore.  I've got all the tank loot I want outside of the Akama boots, and I use the SR boots for Shahraz anyway, and tank healing just doesn't feel hectic now, because her burst is not deadly.<br>
<br>
When you can have a few MT healers ported and not have to worry that the few seconds between that happening and calling for help on the MT is going to lead to a tank death, a lot of things become less of an issue.<br>
<br>
We still wipe sometimes to just RNG screwage, but we haven't stacked ourselves against that (aka tank thrown in the air then lashed, or one tank ported, one thrown in the air, MT on the ground lashed) but far more often if we leash her it's to a new app, or someone who hasn't been raiding for a while coming back and getting a few people killed with FA.  just doesn't seem to be a huge concern anymore to kill her quickly and painlessly.</div>

This is the first response I can actually respect in regards to the 1 camp strategy.  We haven't been killing her for quite as long, but have experienced similar results and ultra quick kills with a 2 ranged camp strategy, and have had the added benefit of never being subject to the possibility of 3-4 ports onto a single camp in the same fight wiping us. <br>
<br>
Thankfully (or perhaps even unfortunately as we somewhat like this encounter), this has 0 real meaning come tomorrow, and probably isn't worth arguing further.<br>
<br>
Both strategies may have there merit, and which strategy anyone chooses to argue is most likely based on how there particular guild sets it up.</div>

		<div id="post_message_486486">After endless tries on Mother we decided to use the one clamped group in the middle of the benches. That was yesterday after a 1st insta shot tank wipe we got on with the 2nd proper try of the night. At 60% we lost 2 people in an FA and kept going until she went down and it was our first mother kill.<br>
<br>
This fight is a lottery wherever you decide to split your groups for FA ports there is always a chance you will get 10 ports in the raid or 10 ports on the MT. This was happened with our kill lucky FA's and it was a smooth kill.<br>
<br>
My question is for the guilds who kill her every reset. Does it feel a lottery every time? You still get unlucky with FA ports?<br>
<br>
I hope that 2.2 will make this encounter less depending on luck factors and make it so that with a perfect execution like the archimonde encounter is now</div>

		<div id="post_message_486534">Having tried  this 1-ranged-group strategy once with disastrous results (relearning sucks) I guess I'm not really convinced it matters.<br>
<br>
Granted if you use 1 ranged group you get ports on people less frequently but you get more people affected by it. Or as Gurgthock put it, it influences the options ported people have where they can run to.<br>
<br>
I can come up with reasons for multiple ranged groups as well though.<br>
Yes you get ports on people more often but fewer people get hit by it.<br>
I find people aren't really restricted in where they can move to after getting ported except for melee. If you get ported on other players they just move and you choose some direction relative to the other ported people.<br>
Your entire ranged camp (healers) does not need to move when ported on so more steady healing.<br>
<br>
I can even make the same claim as Gurgthock that we have been one-shotting Shahraz quite regularly while using a 3-ranged-groups strategy.</div>

Melee tend to hug the wall a bit more, casters stand at the VERY EAST of the overhang, but still under it.  This way everyone is under the overhang to avoid being burst up in the air.  We have 2 healers stand outside of the group on the road to help with FA people.  1 directly south of the melee/tank area, 1 SE of the caster group.  FA people are instructed to (attempt) to go so that one person heads to the entrance, one to where Mother starts, one to the waterfall on the south side of the road.  Run right through the healer if you can to.  Everyone has (or claims to have!) 365 SR.<br>

I realize this encounter is getting nerfed a LOT tomorrow, but it would still be nice to have some input on how to improve.  I'm sure that we would of had 4-5 kills tonight just with caster dps increased, nevermind countless people dieing to the last 1-2 ticks of FA damage.  I really wish we could of killed her before the nerf, but at least I can say we tried.</div>

We used 3 hunter chain-dropping snakes.  A total of 66 parries from snakes and 64 from me, totaling 132 parries (2 from an OT) all together and she hit me 50 times so it's likely it was up near every swing.  I was never remotely close to dying even with a couple ports near me.  Interestingly her total shadow damage done via beams was a little over 600k.  Snakes ate slightly over 300k of that, as well as soaking 3 lashes. <br>
Looking at other top 20 kills with similar 5m kill times the MT incoming melee damage ranges wildly from 500-700k, with a few as low as 370k.  So a net gain of 100k less raid damage using snakes versus the lowest figure and up to 400k less damage using the highest.  Most of the damage is funneled into a single 25k hp soak with snakes as well, that is easy to heal rather then all over the raid which can be challenging at times.  <br>

It's a bit like heigan, you can explain it how much as you want on boards etc, but in the end, players need to experience it by themselves to handle it.

So a net gain of 100k less raid damage using snakes versus the lowest figure and up to 400k less damage using the highest.  Most of the damage is funneled into a single 25k hp soak with snakes as well, that is easy to heal rather then all over the raid which can be challenging at times.  <br>
Definitely worth the snakes.</div>

</div>Just a question/comment, it looks like in the WWS that while there may be ports near you, you only took 3 ticks total of shadow damage from people with FA on the kill, were the other attempts where you took significantly more FA damage more spiky on you as a tank?<br>
<br>
My biggest concern with using a druid was always the fact that FA would do more damage, and wouldn't leave any emergency buttons, personally as soon as an FA is near me my fingers start hovering over Shadowmoon Insignia and Last Stand, and I know a druid doesn't have those options.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_487314"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Part of the benefit of using snakes is that fewer people get ported most of the time.  In the 7 attempts (4 real 3 resets and 1 auto leash) I think 7-8 times people got ported near or on top of me, but almost every time it was 1 or 2 people.  I could always trinket for another 13% dodge should there be some on top of me, but my paladin OT's were instructed to bubble and spam heals on me should that happen, as they would die themselves should lash him them then.  I only have 25k hp right now, and I could easily top 26k should the Anetheron mace ever drop and we we're always running in negatives with blue gems.  The one time I died from a FA+burst when 2 of my healers got the FA and one was silenced was worth the other benefits.  <br>
Anyway it won't matter either way with 2.2 today.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

That seems like a crapshoot to me, since they'd bubble because there was extra damage on the tanks, and a full damage lash plus FA plus melee seems very dangerous.<br>

Anyway it's interesting to see you siting snakes, we never got those to affect FA ports, but maybe it was just bad luck, we just decided it wasn't worth it for the parries.  Good to see you got the kill, congrats.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_487533"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I actually don't know if bubble would make lash not hit them, maybe that is why 3 snakes got hit by lash?  A long time ago on my mage while learning C'thun I once ice blocked to avoid chaining a beam between groups, it jumped right through me (doing no damage) and still multiplied to everyone else, so I always thought bubble worked the same way.  You can't be the primary target of an ability but secondary effects of that ability will hit you regardless if you happen to be in their range.  I never researched it or anything, so I could be totally wrong.  If not then I must have dodged every lash when they had bubble up as I never got hit for more then 7-8k.<br>
On a semi related note, we happen to have a lot of paladins and we use 5 of them on Bloodboil soaking almost every boil.  About 2 weeks ago they must have hotfixed the boil as it no longer targeted the paladins on the 4th set when they had bop/bubble up, when in previous kills it did.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>If your guild had the fight on farm before 2.2 this fight is more or less trivial.  The only thing that can really wipe you is people doing poorly on FA.  Even still, FA is nerfed, we use the single group strat and we had 3 unlucky FA's into the raid and if this happened last week they all would of caused a wipe but tonight no one died on all 3 of those bad FA's. <br>
<br>
No more insta-gibs on the MT gives off the feeling like Gruul did that first time after they nerfed him.  In regards to guilds who haven't killed him yet or are not in BT yet will find learning this fight on a lot smaller learning curve and I'm willing to bet that the Hearts will be the second biggest thing holding guilds back behind learning how to survive FA, but I hear there are mods that help now.<br>
<br>
As for caster DPS, I don't have a WWS but pre 2.2 all we were in the 300 DPS range and would make fun of those that finished below the MT and tonight all of our casters were between 800 and 1000 DPS for the fight.  Melee still do really well on this fight but the gap has definitely shrunk.<br>

If you haven't killed her, you'll have a much better learning curve at least.  FA is far more forgiving and repeated ports on groups of people shouldn't wipe you anymore.

Some classes (healers maybe?) might be able to get by with less, since they could just stand still and heal themselves on FA ports.<br>

		<div id="post_message_489664"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->See if you can get people to get a random green SR item to wear.   I think it's definitely worthy to go give her a shot primarily for the reason that her trash is a good source of drops -- and while you're at her, why not at least pull her and get a little comfortable with the fight?   Get people a little familiar with it, round out the SR in the next week, then buff up and kill her then.  I think for serious, serious attempts you still want as much SR as possible, just it's not quite as punishing if you aren't capped -- but you still want to be close to it.<br>

For tanks, everyone has a different opinion on it and that probably hasn't really changed.  I don't remember the exact number ours runs with, but definitely uses some and it made all the difference for us.  Your mileage may vary.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_489773"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I think snowy's advice is fair on the SR.  When you are learning you will still be taking those 3000 point shared ticks.  <br>
<br>
I think he most eloquently described how the fight is now.  It is easy for those who have the fight on farm (and I'm hearing quite fun now since you do not have to stack your raid, can bring in casters, and can finally properly rotate people for loot as a priority).  It is also going to be a much nicer learning curve for new guilds as the elements are mostly present to the fight - but the bullshit insta-wipes for doing nothing wrong are basically gone.  <br>
<br>
As to how hard it is for a new guild to learn - well who knows.  We killed shahraz on our 2nd or 3rd night of doing her - she wasn't overly difficult, it was just the consistency that made it suck for us - and wipe after wipe after wipe of attempts where we should have been "practicing" with SR pots, or positioned differently.  I'm personally a big fan of not wiping when you execute the mechanics of a fight well.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_492334">I think the fight retains the sense of purpose - while losing most of the ridiculous wipes.<br>
<br>
Basically a guild that has defeated this fight will repeat the kill much more readily, with less raid stacking, and less potential headaches (read: easier to swap and farm people with, or easier to simply keep the same raid as you had with RoS).  <br>
<br>
New guilds will still have to learn this fight, and like all things this will become quicker as the game ages.  But ports on the raid will still cause new guilds to falter, and the Main tank still takes a lot of damage.  FA-chasers will die, etc.  <br>
<br>
Overall a guild learning this fight now will be caught in so many less "you lose" situations than before, and soon people will be pretending like they never existed in the first place.  <br>
<br>
It is an amazing statement for me personally to say that I am looking forward to this fight again next week.</div>

		<div id="post_message_492637">We had our first Raid on Shahraz yesterday night, and more or less expected to spend the whole night there, however, it went a bit different... which ended up in us killing her on our second pull.<br>
<br>
I have sadly never done the fight pre-nerf, so I can only imagine how frustrating it was from reading this thread, and we've been a bit scared of her beforehand, which luckily didn't prevent us from trying her as soon as we could hand out 6 Hearts to everyone<br>
<br>
Anyway, the cause for our wipe on the first pull was that I died tanking her, on our second try we did not lose anyone until at around ~40%, where we lost 2 players who messed their FA up a bit. In total we had 5 or 6 players dying on our kill attempt (We were using the everyone-in-one spot strategy)<br>
<br>
So, from my point of view this seemed a bit overnerfed. Now, I obviously lack a bit of experience with this fight, so I can't say if we just got incredibly lucky with the FA's (I heard on TS at least 2 times that only 1 or 2 players got ported (but I didn't really look around for FA's all the time), and we didn't have a FA directly on the raid), or if this is the new 'intended' way of going.<br>
<br>
The fact that the 7th boss in BT is basically free loot now just seems quite odd to me...<br>
<br>
<br>
Oh just one more thing: Our raid setup was quite normal, we had our usual amount of melee and ranged dps and 8 healers (2 Priests, 2 Druids, 3 Paladins, 1 Shaman)</div>

		<div id="post_message_492668">25-27k in 2s isn't much of a problem if you have 25-27k hp.  That aside, it was entirely possible to one shot it pre-nurf with no ports on the raid and mostly 1-2 ports when they did happen.  I think we had a 3% wipe after 90 minutes of attempts pre-nurf, and I'm sure a lot of others did too.  It basically is free loot now when you are all SR capped, but when you factor in heart farming you probably spend more time in total getting Shahraz down then any other boss in T6 content.<br>
When we finally got to her, we had to do 12 trash runs over 2 days basically back to back 45m-90m runs with 40m downtime between each to get enough hearts to attempt it, and that was with a lot of people only getting 6 hearts per and being under the cap.  I'm not sure how many total hours that amounts to but it's something to be considered.<br>
Now that Hyjal drops hearts too, that may upset the balance some though.<br>
<br>
I am a bit surprised they allowed dps to go so much higher on her from casters and didn't increase her HP (ala Rag).  Our first kill was 5m2s if I remember correctly and I expect 3-4m on Sunday when we get to her again.  That is a lot less FAs.</div>

		<div id="post_message_492701">To be fair, it was 26.8k in 2.2 seconds and a fairly worst case scenario (melee+lash+melee with CoR, untalented Devotion, no AF/Insp, 5 seconds into a pull with no misdirect where rage issues lost a block).<br>
<br>
It wasn't my idea to be attacking, but the understanding was that we would find out pretty quickly if parry wasn't changed. Having tried it and looking over combat logs I don't see her swing timer deviating from ~1.9-2.4 seconds at the time of death regardless of the presence of parries. Certainly nothing like the parry gibs I see in others' WWS reports from the previous night where she attacked twice in less than a second. I feel that if we were experiencing parry hastes we would have blatantly wiped to that at least once instead of other problems.</div>

It wouldn't, so yeah, don't be condescending when you're wrong.<br>

And yes, our WWS showed 4.5m damage instead of 3.9m damage this week, would explain why the kill was longer than last weeks when we had heroisms over and over for melee vs this week with higher caster damage and less heroisms (i think less heroisms)<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
Really, the main thing that's too easy is that you have to be <b>REALLY</b> bad to die to FA now if you pop consumables and have max SR.  FA should be more dangerous to the people selected for porting, while remaining roughly unchanged for the collateral bystanders.  An FA that worked like the 2.2 version for non-FA'd people and like the 2.1 version for the FA'd people would be perfect, or something along those lines.<br>
<br>
The 3 people who get ported should have to play well to live (with some leeway if they get good healing support while FA is ticking), but ports onto a stack of players should not be as catastrophic as they were in 2.1.  I kind of doubt Blizzard will make more changes to this fight, but that's the one thing that would help if they were to do so.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

The idea on the table is that FA needs to hurt the ported people more without moving becoming more dangerous to the non-ported people.  If FA also had a debuff component that lowered SR by, say, 100, then that end would be well-served.  It'd remain pretty harmless to others nearby provided they got away, but the actual ported people would be facing damage much closer to pre-2.2 levels.

</div>Yeah I went in this past week with just the neck on and got FAed right on top of a couple of times, my health barely even budged. The difference in physical mitigation was tremendous.<br>
<br>
Gonna try it again next time, I worry slightly about hit + lash + beam + FA, but even then I think I have the health to survive that in normal gear right now if it did happen. Thats what Last Stand/Shield Wall/Healthstones are for anyways.<br>
<br>
I like the idea of the FA people getting hurt more then everyone else either via a resist debuff or a +damage% amp. The fight is so quick now with the increased caster damage that FA really is a nuisance rather then a danger. I don't doubt that every single FA could be on top of the raid now and it'd still be pretty easy for everyone to survive including the FAed folks via consumables/bandages. At least if the FA people are taking a bit more damage, theres actually some risk of losing somebody to something besides mass stupidity.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>If there was a -resist component then people would simply add that amount (or close to) in their gear so that its effect would be minimal at best in order to thwart it.<br>
<br>
However removing the raid damage and increasing the damage taken by the FA players would be a welcome change. Then RNG ports will not screw you over and it moves the fight less from luck, and more into the realms of compitency checks, because quite honestly Teron does this better than Mother.<br>

		<div id="post_message_494383">I think the fight is overall fine at the moment.  My philosophy on resist gear fights is that they pretty much suck if you make them hard because you can't even wear your best gear for them.  To me the hard part about resist gear fights should be getting the resist gear.  Once you get it, it should be a really easy fight and if they want to slow down progression just make the resist gear harder/take longer to get.  If you had to go into mother with 225 SR (or greens with terrible stats) then yeah it should be hard.  But, when you cap your SR off the BT epics you shouldn't still be having difficulty with the fight.<br>
<br>
Regarding MT shadow resist gear, I'll still wear my 205, I don't lose anything with bracer/cloak/neck, only gain some survivability against a MT port.  MT ports can still be fatal combined with melee/lash/beam combo.</div>

</div>I guess it depends on what people feel the intended difficulty level should be.  I think that right now Shahraz is probably around Azgalor's difficulty, which is I suppose reasonable.  Just a far cry from what she used to be. But I guess in 2.1 you could argue that she was really out of place when compared to Azgalor and Council, the other t6-dropping non-end-boss encounters.</div>

Just takes the randomness of where your people choose to run away even if creates dangerous situations if they decide to follow it religiously and run towards their arrow through the raid.

<br>
On our first kill last week we had 2 tauren (MT+sponge) and 1 orc (sponge) and the orc tank just didn't get Saber Lash damage at all and was ported quite a lot. Being told by a GM that this was a known bug we just did it with 2 tanks and a Nightfall-swinging deftank in Shahraz' back.<br>
<br>
Returning to Shahraz this week we expected to have a bugfree encounter. But bringing 1 tauren MT and 2 orc sponges we got some nasty insta-gib Saber Lashes on the MT. After switching MTing players around we noticed it had to do with race/model of the MT. <br>
Feeding the Tauren MT some Deviate did the job for us. Ninja MT + 2 Orc sponges got the Saber Lash damage equally distributed and brought us the kill a few tries later.</div>

So we pretty much gimped the raid to get everyone to capped resistances. Healing output (8 healers and only 2 tanks for Saber Lash instead of 3) was a non-issue.<br>

		<div id="post_message_503321">I have been reading through this thread, and I found the tanks' gear choice quite interesting.<br>
<br>
The first time we started Mother, me as maintank, I noticed the burst dmg potential of this boss on the MT with a few unlucky parry and sabre lash procs. The shadow dmg was of course also noticeable but it was not the source of "spike damage". <br>
<br>
So, my initial reaction to this boss was "This is pretty much like Sapp. The boss hits hard, yes there is magical dmg incoming, but it is still best to use full tanking gear to avoid/mitigate as many incoming physical dmg as possible because that is the source of spike dmg here."<br>
<br>
I, of course, tested using some shadow res as well just to see the results, but I quickly ended up switching back to full tanking gear, as, from my own experience, full tanking gear (high avoidance) provides more safety as mt in this fight. Thus, I been tanking this boss for almost 10 weeks now with no sr gear at all, and I didn't really have any problems so far.<br>
<br>
Especially, with the new changes to this boss, the shadow dmg to the mt is much more predictable than the physical dmg.</div>

		<div id="post_message_503610">Max it out for offtanks, I'd say. The difference between ~265 and 365 resist is very pronounced, and taking even 1k more damage per saber lash due to reduced armor (... unlikely though) still adds up to less chance of spike deaths. <br>

Saber lash is on a predictable timer, and healer mana is relatively a non-issue now, so gimping avoidance and copping more hits for a less overall chance of bad spikes is a good thing.<br>

		<div id="post_message_504285">Went in tonight with between 300 and 330 SR on most of the raid (a few were between 330 and the cap, but not more than 5 or so), and proceeded to kill her on our third pull (80%, 70%, 0%)<br>
<br>
I feel really bad for those that had to kill her pre-2.2. We had a few damage spikes on the MT, but I can only begin to imagine what it must've been like before.<br>
<br>
Anyway, for the record, we used the one-ranged-pile technique, up against the wall on the left, as you face Shahraz. Tanks in that little corner, and ranged closer to Shahraz.<br>
<br>
Seemed to work pretty well - tons of room for the FAers to move!<br>
<br>
The two first pulls were using different positioning, but I doubt the sample set is really big enough to say that the up-against-the-wall position is the best -- but it seemed to work OK!<br>
<br>
Oh, and the flasks of chromatic wonder are nice and cheap, and can help you get that last 30 points of SR, if you have the belt/bracers/boots/cloak + necklace, and the 20 SR enchant on your t4/5/whatever helm.<br>
<br>
Edit: Our MT wore just cloak + necklace, and 2 druid OTs were wearing the 300ish that the rest of the raid had.<br>
<br>
Also, we had the druids attacking, and snake traps, and no sign of 'insta-parry-death'. So it may indeed have been hotfixed. Or she got nerfed so hard it doesn't matter.</div>

		<div id="post_message_505493"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Well some suggestions , <br>
<br>
1)Have your shamans using all 4 totems(they can be targeted for FA with 3 shamans that we went you can imagine how easier that is)<br>
2)We were standing all raid in one spot , 1 priest a bit outside so he casts pom to FA'ed people <br>
3)The raid didn't stand close to some wall we stood in the middle of the way (We got 3 unlucky FA's at first pulls with 3 persons getting teleported between the wall and the raid making the raid damage HUGE<br>
4)We used Bracers-belt-back-neck-boots , personally as a mage i used Mage armor and +35res/+18stats flask to hit the cap others used some green rings (30stam/20SR or something like that) or enchanted some old head with +20 SR from Lower City vendor (honored rep required if i remember correctly)<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_520580"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->So aiming for about 250 SR unbuffed across the raid should be fine? We're running into a lack of HoD here as we really only see about 5-10 a week from a Hyjal clear and our regular bosses in BT. At this rate it would take 6 months to cover the 240 HoD required to gear an entire raid group (we kind of blew through BT quickly). I've been buying AH green SR like it's been going out of style. Obviously these aren't as good as the epic versions but should work nearly as good I'm hoping.<br>
<br>
So for SR just wanted to get a benchmarked goal so correct me if the following is out of whack:<br>
<br>
Raid Member: 250 SR (unbuffed)<br>
MT: 200 SR (unbuffed)<br>
OTs: Max SR<br>
<br>
I read someone suggesting chromatic flasks.. are you also using SR armor patches and the rep SR helm enchant?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>We had our first two attempts on Shahraz late last night after getting RoS down for the first time.  I don't think everyone really understood the fight too well going in but after almost having the MT instagibbed on the first pull we had something like 65% and 58% wipes, both times from the MT dying in 3-4 seconds from hit / sabre lash / hit.  A few people died here and there to FA (no one really had more than 300-310SR) but it didn't seem to be TOO many.. it seems a problem we had was either two people tended to run the same direction and gibbing each other before either reacted, or people weren't topped off before getting the port so they only had ~75% health to begin with.  We also didn't have any shadow resist cauldrons which I assume would help a ton with this.<br>
<br>
Are there any suggestions to keeping the tank from dying so quickly or is it just the bad end of the RNG?  I don't think it was from parries since no one was at her side, but I'm sure having assigned healers just spam the crap out of the MT will help.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">So aiming for about 250 SR unbuffed across the raid should be fine? We're running into a lack of HoD here as we really only see about 5-10 a week from a Hyjal clear and our regular bosses in BT. At this rate it would take 6 months to cover the 240 HoD required to gear an entire raid group (we kind of blew through BT quickly). I've been buying AH green SR like it's been going out of style. Obviously these aren't as good as the epic versions but should work nearly as good I'm hoping.<br>
<br>
So for SR just wanted to get a benchmarked goal so correct me if the following is out of whack:<br>
<br>
Raid Member: 250 SR (unbuffed)<br>
MT: 200 SR (unbuffed)<br>
OTs: Max SR<br>

</div>You will be taking extra damage? That's the fucking understatement of the year, you will be taking upwards of 9k damage per second if people aren't fast. I don't remember any FA ports on top of the tank though, yet. I sure as hell wouldn't like to see it on a tank with no SR what so ever though.<br>

Something that helps on Shahraz is to disable, or move, SCTD. Together with SCT you will receive absurb amounts of spam and that can make it difficult to see where the others are going.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Just pick a random direction to go in and have some other people who aren't FA'd call out if 2-3 symbols are running with each other (DBM/BigWigs puts raid markers on all the people FA'd...so for example someone would say "skull and moon are running together, split off).<br>

</div>I can't speak for EJ, but what you describe sounds right.<br>
<br>
For Saber Lash, you no longer have to turn your back (which almost guarantess a hit) in order to avoid knockbacks.  Now as long as you were a valid target for the Saber Lash, you'll be immune to the knockback and FA, even if you dodge or parry it.  This was changed in 2.2.  However, since Shahraz still gets hasted attacks when she parries, having those OTs NOT attack is still recommended in my experience.  She's obviously still capable of putting out massive damage spikes that you're better off avoiding.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Sorry if this has been answered in the thread already; however I looked through an EJ WWS for this encounter and was curious as to why their OT warriors don't do any damage during the encounter? I noticied that they didn't have their back turns to the boss to guarantee being hit by Saber Lash; so my only assumption was to prevent their attacks from being Parried? Is my assumption correct?<br>
<br>
Ideally I wanted to do this fight with a Prot Warrior MT, Feral Druid OT and Paladin OT if possible. Solely because they can provide extra damage.<br>
<br>
edit- here is the WWS I viewed; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080412022912/http://wowwebstats.com/yqy6l2dshv1te?s=11888-12185&amp;m" target="_blank">Wow Web Stats</a></div>

		<div id="post_message_558774"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->The general theory on the single and double ports are due to one of the OT's or the MT being targeted.  Similar to the "MT picked for Doom on Azgalor" type stuff.  Since they are immune due to the Saber Lash debuff, nothing happens to them and everyone is happy.  Pets are another possibility, they don't have the saber lash immune debuff, but could of been intentionally designated "permanent immune", although that would mean the devs left in the option for them to be picked in the first place.  Generally my raid only has 2-3 pets out so it would be hard to get a decent idea.  Perhaps if a guild decided to test out 3-4 hunters and 3-4 locks on a few kills they could get a decent guess as to "can pets be targeted".  I would however say almost certainly totems cannot be targeted.. 8 or 12 totems up at a time generally in my raid and we certainly average more than 2 people per port.<br>
<br>
As for all three tanks being picked - you're looking at about a 0.04% chance of that happening.  Certainly this falls into the category of "something most people will never see" and for the rare guild that gets this once.  Its entirely possible no one would notice or it would be assumed something glitched, people would be happy for their good fortune and keep dps'ing, healing, dieing, etc.<br>

		<div id="post_message_560946"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->So if people that are taking saber lash cant be targeted, why not have a LOT of people up there eating saber lash?  I mean, like, everyone except for the rogues/dpswars?<br>
<br>
If you had 20 people eating saber lash, it would be about 4k damage each pre-mitigation, easilly healable.  Yeah, people would get silenced from time to time, but the silence is SR based and with &gt;365 you will resist 3/4 of the silences at least.<br>
<br>
The huge upside is, of course, you almost completely eliminate FA from the fight, as all of the people eating saber lash are "immune" from getting FA.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_562813"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I've been curious about what causes FA's with 1-2 ports too. Main suggestions so far seem:<br>
<br>
- totems<br>
- pets<br>
- binary spell resists<br>
<br>
I tried to do some fast math on the chances, assuming that every target that can get picked, has an equal chance to get picked. There are 22 eligible raiders (MT+2x OT are immune).<br>
<br>
For totem / pets:<br>
<br>
# of targettable totem/pets = T<br>
# of targettable players = P<br>
<br>
The amount of 3 port FA's should then be (1-(T/(T+P))^3)*100% (1 minus the chance of a nonplayer port ^3 ). With a T of 12 (totems from 4 shamans) and a P of 22, that value is 27% 3man FA's. With a T of 3 (3 hunter pets) and a P of 22, you'd get 68% 3man FA's.<br>
<br>
If it's a binary resistable spell, and a shadow spell, you should be resisting 25% of the time, assuming the whole raid is at max SR (Not 100% sure i'm correct on this, anyone able to confirm this?). This means that you'd have (0.75)^3*100% = 42% chance of 3 man FA.<br>
<br>
All 3 of these values do not correspond with my experiences. If I'd have to guess, you get a 3man port about 80% of the time. Haven't tracked it or tried to get numbers out of WWS's though. If it is one of the 3 above, my guess it's  probably be the hunter pets (Who can die during the encounter)<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<!-- message -->
		<div id="post_message_565186"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I think the probability of a 3-player port should actually be <b>(</b> (P) choose 3 <b>)</b> / <b>(</b> (T+P) choose 3 <b>)</b>, which is the number of possible 3-player port groups (choosing 3 out of the set P) over the total number of possible port groups chosen (choosing 3 out of the set P+T).<br>
<br>
Another way of looking at this is that for a 3-player port she must first pick a player, then a different player, and then a third also different player, making the probability: <b>(</b> P/(P+T) <b>)</b> * <b>(</b> (P-1)/(P+T-1) <b>)</b> * <b>(</b> (P-2)/(P+T-2) <b>)</b>. Both of these ways of looking at it will give the same result when you put some numbers in for P and T.<br>
<br>
My guess is that she can't target totems and pets, also can't target the MT, but will target the two (immune) offtanks. This makes P = 22 and T = 2 for a 3-player port probability of 76.1%, pretty close to Dorlog's guess of 80%.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_571564"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->This fight is a big let down, imo. To quote someone after our first kill, 'We just wear our SR and Shahraz falls over after 6 minutes'. No real sense of accomplishment lbecause the fight demands very little (now, I cant comment on old versions) except from 'run away when you get fa ported, lol'. Its a innovative mechanic idea, but implemented into what makes for a very bland fight imo.<br>
<br>
The only thing I found myself doing on Shahraz was being bored spamming Fireball and amusing myself as people with FA scatter , trying to survive. At least Illidari council, despite being too long.. kept me on my toes the whole time with a myriad of things I need to look out for.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_572626"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Went in for our first actual attempts on her this evening and she got 3-shotted. Really, it was 2-shotted. The first wipe was just bad positioning on the tanks part for Saber Lashes. The second wipe was people figuring out how FA worked. Beyond that, everyone had a shadow protection pot to buy them a little more time during FA ports and our third attempt was a kill. This fight is very, very easy with proper resist gear and people who can move immediately after an FA. All the talk about "bring 10 healers to learn it your first time" isn't really very accurate. We had 7 real healers and a prot Paladin.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_573349"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->There's really no need to get cute with positioning, LOS or anything fancy. We just stacked all of our ranged DPS and healers on top of each other way against a wall on a bush. Tanked her about 25yds in front of us along the same wall. Reduced the chances FA gets anywhere near the main raid because her possible FA port locations are 90% or more away from 15ish other people. We initially looked at the 3 group strategy and just junked the idea. Why spread out and create more chances for an FA to land on 5 people? Further, Chain Heal is enormously useful here.

		<div id="post_message_574991"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Hello,<br>
<br>
I couldn't really find an answer to my question in the last 3-4 page of this thread, if it already has been answered feel free to point me to it.<br>
<br>
We just killed Reliquary of Souls a few days ago in 1 night, and we're still running a bit low on Hearts of Darkness. In other words: we dont have enough to provide an entire raid with the full crafted epic resistance set. I understand wearing capped SR on all non-tanks makes this encounter quite easy these days, so that's what were aiming for for our first kill. I also read that its wiser to have the MT wear his normal tanking gear, he will take more damage from the beams, but he will take less damage from melee hits and Saber Lashes. My question is though: what do the 2 Offtanks use? SR-gear or their own gear? Im guessing SR-gear, but i wasnt totally sure. They are immune to FA, but will still get hit by all the other beams except the one with the lowest damage.<br>
<br>
Another aspect i have been wondering about is positioning. My current plan is to have her tanked against a wall and have the raid stand approx. 25 yards behind her also against the same wall, so the chance of the FA porting people near the raid is 50% smaller. Exactly like someone suggested a few posts above this. Is this the most common strategy? Or are there positions that make more sense. I want the whole (ranged) raid on top of each other, to get maximum potential from Chain Heal and Circle of Healing. I know that if FA ports into the raid we're kind of screwed, but the same thing happens when you have 3 groups and it only makes the chance of FA porting into a group bigger.<br>
<br>
Also, any clues on what the cooldown of Fatal Attraction is? Or isnt there one and is it used on completely random timers?<br>
<br>
Any help and feedback to these questions is greatly appreciated.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Maximum SR (295 unbuffed) and maximum health/avoidance. You don't need 490 defense to eat Saber Lash, only the MT does. And they aren't immune to FA from other players, so you do want them to have max SR.<br>

Also regarding the HoDs. Don't make the leggings, they're too expensive. Currently we're making cloak/bracers and boots only and we use green gear to make up for the rest. Eventually we'll make belts too, but we won't bother with leggings at all.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_595836"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->After reading through this thread, I am walking away with this general idea as the best strategy for taking on Mother Shahraz:<br>
<br>
Position in a straight line, on either the left or right wall.<br>

	<div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom:0px"><img src="assets/code_html.gif" border="0"></div>

		overflow: auto">_________________________________________________________________________________________
Tanks - Shahraz - Melee - ............ 25 yards or so ............ - Ranged DPS + Healers



                             open space to be ported into




_________________________________________________________________________________________</pre>
</div><br>
Try to get everyone except the tanks to 295 unbuffed shadow resist.  Hopefully a raid that is lacking HoD's can kill this boss with resist flasks, and shadow protection pots, with the majority of the raid at 300SR fully buffed.  Offtanks should just stand in the proper position without attacking to avoid unnecessary parries.  Tanks don't 'need' to cap SR, but a healthy base amount (150ish buffed) is nice.<br>
<br>
Nothing conclusive about trying to keep 4 totems down per shaman at all times, or the use of snake traps.  I personally think that if the hunter drops the trap at the farthest back edge of the hitbox so that the snakes don't run around to the front (and the boss doesn't move) that there is no reason *not* to use snake traps unless it is shown that they don't help with the transports.<br>
<br>
Have the entire raid use <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080409022442/http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info7487-MotherArrows.html" target="_blank">WoWInterface Downloads : MotherArrows</a> at least for the first few kills.  I really don't see how mindlessly following the arrows each time could ever really hurt, even though it may not always be the best choice.  Even if you run into the raid, the other two are guaranteed to run elsewhere, so damage should be minimal.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
For healing assignments, we will probably start with 2 holy pallies and a holy priest on the main tank, a resto druid keeping lifebloom rolling on all 3 tanks, a holy priest on Fatal Attraction duty using PoM and healing people who get ported, and three resto shamans raid healing and helping with offtanks.  And of course adjust from there.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

</div>Forget Shadow Protection Potions. And if you keep your ranged group all in one pile, then 365 buffed on everyone is pretty much mandatory. We split ranged into 3 camps, and use 365 buffed on everyone to keep raid damage under control, though using just 1 group is certainly a common strategy as well. Over all, imo, you somewhat underestimate the need for SR on this encounter though.<br>

</div>Tanks mostly need SR to avoid dying to unlucky FA's close to the tanking position. We tend to go with some on the MT as well as the OTs (usually about 200 buffed). Use a feral tank btw, makes life so much easier..<br>

</div>Make everyone look for the purple beams linking the 2-3 people with FA. If they run so that those beams exit through their backs, they are golden (which is the case if each person is running away from each other, when the beams form a triangle pattern). A beam going to your left, right or front is bad news. No mod is actually needed to sort this out.

				<div style="font-style:italic">Forget Shadow Protection Potions. And if you keep your ranged group all in one pile, then 365 buffed on everyone is pretty much mandatory. We split ranged into 3 camps, and use 365 buffed on everyone to keep raid damage under control, though using just 1 group is certainly a common strategy as well. Over all, imo, you somewhat underestimate the need for SR on this encounter though.</div>

Using up peoples potion cooldowns on shadow protection potions doesn't strike me as a very good idea. And no, the way you propose to stand minimizes the chance of a FA on top of the raid, but as a consequence, you will take 3X the raid damage compared to standing in 3 groups (all her raid damage attacks link to nearby people).<br>

</div>On MS, there is really no movement involved, unless you get FA, so any arbitrarily chosen way of standing is equally simple. FA on top the raid is, in my experience rarely a problem, as they all have 75% mitigation it's very rare for anyone to die to it, with the changed FA. But see how your healer mana holds up with the raid damage, never said one way of standing is superior to another. Our healers just felt their job was easier when we split up into 3 groups, compared to standing in one spot.<br>

</div>I have  to respectfully disagree with a couple things here.  First off, a Major Shadow prot pot can be a lifesaver on a poorly placed FA port.  As long as people spread out quickly, FA Damage is minimized, but having that option available is very important in my opinion.  The general philosophy that we use is to do EVERYTHING in your power to survive.  Sure, you aren't REQUIRED to chug a pot and an HS on an FA like old-timey shahraz, and you probably wouldn't even need one every time, but don't discount the amount of survival a major shadow pot can provide to each of your raid members.<br>
<br>
As for the Warrior vs Druid argument, it's been covered extensively earlier in the thread, and it's more of a toss up than you make it out to be.  Yes, your druid will absolutely take somewhat lower spike damage in general, even though it will generally turn out to be more damage OVERALL in the fight than an equivalently geared warrior would take (As has been shown in WWS logs earlier in this thread).  Still, there's something weird and abnormally high about the saber lash numbers you listed.<br>
<br>
For one thing, It's misleading to look at a single saber lash across three tanks, and use that damage as a comparison for how much damage each of those players would be taking from saber lash as an MT, since the gear you wear while OTing is VERY different than the gear worn while MTing.  As a warrior MT for this fight, my saber lashes are around 7k to 7.5k.. I've occasionally seen the odd 8k+ saber lash, but those are typically few and far between.<br>
<br>
Either way, the trade off is that while your Warrior MT may possibly take somewhat more spike damage, he or she can also survive longer without a heal in the event of a triple-healer port, or a badly located port on top of the raid... so it really depends on a judgement call on the part of the raid.  Our experience has been generally that warriors are more appropriate MT's for Mother, while Druids are better suited to OT's, for their superior armor mitigation while at capped SR.  Clearly, for this revision of mother, the tank classes are pretty much interchangeable, and you can still easily be successful in the fight...but the ability to shield wall, last stand, and use potions (in our experience, at least) has proved to far outweigh the disadvantage of any additional spike damage the warrior MT might take.  Of course, each raid must weigh the disadvantages carefully and use the tank that best fits their raid composition, style, and gear level, so I don't believe there is a clear cut choice of tank class that shines above all others in this fight for every raid.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_598068"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I didn't really say Shadow Protection potions shouldn't be used at all, but rather that you shouldn't cover lack of SR gear with potion usage. That would, among other things, take away the benefit of having an "oh shit" potion for FA, like you describe <br>
<br>
As for the choice of tank; Sabre Lash caps out at ~85,000 damage (before armor mitgation and spread on tanks). This is a bit quickly calculated, but I recon the OH is ~20,000 and the MH ~32,000 before mitigation. So, the maximum peak damage you can take for a warrior (65% mitigation) is: (85,000/3)*0.35+20,000*0.35+32,000*0.35 = ~28,000 damage (-1,000 for 2 SBs). For a druid at the armor cap, the same number ends up as 20,000 damage. Now, a well geared warrior tank with an armor potion would likely end up at closer to 70% mitigation, so wouldn't risk being one shotted, but imho the difference is quite significant with the typical warrior tank ending up uncomfortably close to the limit of what he or she can take in one go. We certainly had quite a lot of wipes due to the tank just dropping dead from a lash+MH+OH combo when we started off on MS. It seemed like the dice ended up with at an average one really high damage tripple combo killing them / fight.<br>
<br>
As for who takes more overall damage over the whole fight, yeah, that is pretty trivial to work out, but does it matter? The average DPS on the MT isn't actually that high on MS, around 2,000, but she is able to deliver quite silly spike damage. Nothing in TBC raid content has really been capped by available healer mana. So where peak damage is an issue, we go with a feral tank, the job for the healers is much more relaxed when the tank doesn't drop to 5% every so often.. As a warrior who used to tank through MC =&gt; Naxx, TBC has been quite a dissappointment with bosses designed to favour bear tanks (see how many warriors use dodge &amp; parry gems in their gear over stamina..) apart from the odd few actually untankable by druids (Illidan, RoS, etc). Hence why I specced damage for this expansion. I keep hoping WotLK will favour something else than armor and stamina on tanks.<br>
<br>
But, the whole unholy trinity of bear tanks, shadow priests and spike damage is somewhat outside the scope of this topic, sorry for digressing <!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_598713"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Guild is gonna try her this Sunday for the first time, just have a few questions.  For SR, we are having the 2 offtanks capped and everyone else sitting around 320-350 raid buffed, with a few members capped.  MT will wear full tanking gear and the two offtanks are feral. Is 0 SR on the MT a good idea?, I know a FA port +saber on him might cause an insta gib, or is this rare enough that simply saving last stand or shield wall should fix it? To hit the 365 cap, is it worth having everyone wear 1-2 greens of shadow protection since I have heard the difference between 330 to 365 is like night and day in terms of damage migration.<br>
<br>
For the fight, is the positioning shown above where you tank her on a wall and have the ranged 25 yards down the same wall the best idea to learn it?  This seems to increase the area people can get FA to and reduces the risk of them landing on the Ranged or MT group. Also if shadow protection potions are saved until we have a FA land on the group, how much stupid is allowed for the FA runners if they land on the group? Also from reading the posts it seems totems (maybe snakes) are valid targets for FA but immune to port, just wanted to confirm it.<br>
<br>
Finally, regarding her trash. How many people do you need to successfully farm it, as well as the ideal minimum group setup(tanks/heals/dps, have access to a prot pally).  The aoe packs seem to MC quite a bit, however not sure if its interruptible.  In a full clear we only received two from a sister of pain and a priestess, was this just bad luck on our part or are the drops just over hyped?<br>
<br>
Also, we spent about 3 hours learning and killing bloodboil and ROS this week, given this should we expect a mother kill Sunday (4-5 hours of raiding) and maybe even a council kill on Monday if we do get her?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">s for the choice of tank; Sabre Lash caps out at ~85,000 damage (before armor mitgation and spread on tanks). This is a bit quickly calculated, but I recon the OH is ~20,000 and the MH ~32,000 before mitigation. So, the maximum peak damage you can take for a warrior (65% mitigation) is: (85,000/3)*0.35+20,000*0.35+32,000*0.35 = ~28,000 damage (-1,000 for 2 SBs). For a druid at the armor cap, the same number ends up as 20,000 damage.</div>

</div>That doesn't account for defensive stance, but it doesn't matter; You're still right and I still agree with you that a bear will take lower spike damage.  That can't really be argued. My difference of opinion is this:  Your choice of tank is just determining which kind of "worst case scenario" your raid intends to plan for.  <br>
<br>
If a bear or a warrior take the peak hits decscribed above  (which I think are perhaps a bit on the high side for her melee attacks, unless the boss isn't debuffed at ALL, I suppose),  they can both be brought down to a health range in which the next hit can kill them if a heal doesn't land. The ability for a warrior to keep himself alive at this point is where he has the advantage, in my opinion.<br>
<br>
For us, when learning this fight, the tank getting 1 shotted wasn't ever an issue.. It was bad healer FA ports that caused tank deaths, and a warrior can react to that.  If your raid is finding the tank spike damage to be problematic, then a Druid MT may well be a more appropriate solution.  As I mentioned before, you can tank Shahraz with any class and still be successful, but if you're learning the fight, you should probably consider the pros and cons of your raid make-up and the gear level of your tanks to best determine the right choice of tank class =)  There isn't just one "right answer", since both classes each have their own advantages.<br>
<br>
For the situations we found to be troublesome, a warrior tank was the right answer <!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_600774"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->We killed Mother Shahraz yesterday for the first time. I must admit we made the full sets (due to a lot of core members quiting the game, we had weeks and weeks to farm trash, ending up with enough Hearts of Darkness for full sets for over 35 players) of Shadow Resistance. But still, this fight is a big joke now. I knew she got nerfed, but not that it was this bad. We had the tanks against the wall in the little corner and the ranged group 25 yards down also against the wall. We got 1 semi Raid Portal, but the raid healers picked that up just fine. With 8 healers, we had 3 Paladins and a Druid on the tanks. Two Shamans on the raid and two Holy priests on the Fatal Attraction targets dishing out Prayer of Mending and Shield.<br>
<br>
I think we had 3 proper attempts before the kill and one instant tank death (who was wearing the necklace and cloak by the way). The attempt we killed her we had 0 deaths.<br>
<br>
So if you're still wondering what tactic to use, i would definately go for this one with one big camp. Even if you get an unlucky portal, its still very healable if your players have half a brain. Ow, and we didn't use Shadow Protection Potions at all.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Sapp, how many healers did your guild take into the raid?<br>
<br>
Our guild killed Reliquary of Souls last night and is going to try Mother Shahraz tonight for the first time.  Unfortunately for us we've had absolutely horrendous luck with Heart of Darkness drop rates and have fewer than 150 for the entire guild.  We're distributing 5 HoD per person and have made a cloak for each of 30 raiders (since we don't know who will show up this week versus next we can't give everything to just 25 people).  Our target is to have ~300 SR on everyone fully buffed.  We're trying to grab up what greens we can, but they're in short supply on Khadgar right now.<br>
<br>
A number of posts have mentioned only crafting partial sets and using greens to make up the rest but, as I mentioned above, we don't have that option as there are virtually no green shadow protection items available for some reason (or have been for the past 3 weeks).<br>
<br>
I'm not sure which strategy we'll be trying to use but, given the changes to the boss encounter, do you guys think this will be possible?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Absolutely possible, but maybe swap out a ranged dps caster for an extra healer or two for learning if you're low on SR (meaning 8 or 9 healers, max).  Mana and splash damage are going to be your biggest problems, I think. With the raid at 300 resist, there's no reason you shouldn't start at least learning the fight and determining your raid positioning, etc.  You may or may not get the kill as quickly as a raid in capped resist, but it's certainly doable.  <br>
<br>
Low resists just means your raid needs somewhat tighter execution, with less room for error.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

We took 8 healers and did the 1 camp strategy and rolled the dice. We took 1 port on the raid only and the rest were dealt with healthstones and healing pots if necessary.

</div>We arrived at MS with a similar amount of Hearts, just a little over 150 iirc. But we enacted a slightly different approach on crafting the gear. Everyone had gatherd materials for all craftable items beforehand, ofc, and also ~50 SR on other items. Some used a green item or two, personally I gemmed my Second Sight helmet with Void Spheres and added an SR enchant on it. Then we went for MS on our saturday raid slot, which is longer than the others and crafted gear using 6 Hearts for the 25 people who were in the raid (Cloak. bracers, belt and boots) so that everyone was at 365 SR, went into BT and managed to kill her that day. By next week, we were prepared to do some trash farming, but that proved unnecessary as we again had just enough new Hearts to gear up the people swapping in.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_604783"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I have some questions about resistance and damage reduction from it and I don't think it needs another thread.<br>
<br>
I've had this idea for a while that resistance doesn't give a linear reduction in damage. Therefor there were some breakpoints where damage reduction would get bumped to the next level. I can't remember where I read it.<br>
<br>
If this is the case then it would be useful to have a table with what those resistance breakpoints are.<br>
<br>
I looked it up on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080409022447/http://www.wowwiki.com/Resistance" target="_blank">WoWWiki</a> and I found some information but it doesn't mention these breakpoints.<br>
As far as I know damage reduction is done in 25% steps.<br>
<br>
If everything I said is correct (and this is where I need confirmation or help) then using the formulas on WoWWiki against a boss (level 73), I got the following figures:<br>
<br>
365 resist -&gt; 75% damage reduction (this is known and confirmed)<br>
244 resist -&gt; 50% damage reduction (actually 50.14%, but I assume rounding is done downwards)<br>
122 resist -&gt; 25% damage reduction<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
<br>
Edit: Changed max resist to 365, was a typo.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>There's no reason to turn your back anymore, by the way. Originally you needed the saber lash to connect to get a debuff that made you immune to ports and knockup, but they changed that. Now she just checks her targets for saber-lash eligibility after selecting them for a port or wicked beam, and discards them as a target if they were eligible.<br>
<br>
I think that's how it works, anyway. Didn't we decide that that was what caused double/single FA's?<br>
<br>
Anyway, you can keep facing her to dodge/parry lashes and cut down on damage you take. A dodge/parry on your part doesn't increase dmg on the other two, if that's what you're worried about. She IS still sucsceptible to parry-haste as far as I know, so don't attack.<br>

</div>When I'm OTing on Mother, I just go max SR gear and don't bother stacking anything else; the last thing anyone wants is having a FA port near the tanks and the healers scramble to top off the MT only to have a OT get gibbed by Saber Lash because the AoE shadow damage dropped them too low.  Otherwise, I'll judge Wisdom and hit her once every 15 seconds or so to keep it up (if our Ret paladin isn't in raid) and throw myself a Holy Light after eating a Saber Lash to lighten the burden on the healers.  It's a bit more exciting than, say, tanking Veras Darkshadow, but not that much.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>We're on the same train really, and while we wiped a few times, it was mostly to bad tank positionning resulting in our MT getting 16k saberlashed, and then a few "real" tries where people would need to understand fatal attraction. Downed her in around 6tries counting the instant mt deaths, as long as you have the SR, the start you use doesn't seem to affect your chances to kill her at all. We used the 1group strat too, and had an attraction on the raid at around 25%, still managed just fine, even tho quite a lot of people died. I doubt she'll last more than a few pulls next week either, just need to get the whole tanking thing going then she's down pretty much, unless you get 3 or more FA on the raid.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Resistance cap against a lvl 73 mob is at 365 buffed, which corresponds to 295 unbuffed. Cardynal meant 300 buffed, naturally.<br>
Note that the chromatic flask counts towards your unbuffed value, stacking fully with the priest/paladin shadow resist buff.<br>
<br>
A lot depends on your raid composition: you can get away with lower raidwide SR if you can bring 4+ carpet-healers like resto shamans or CoH priests. But if you don't have that luxury, I wouldn't slack on preparation <!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>This was essentially what we did on our first kill, but because we'd crafted some items for a few people, had some random haste gear made, ect, there were a few of us with less than 300SR; I myself around 250, if not less, buffed - basically incredibly low, with no greens of Shadow Resistance to cover my ass.  I'm already a mage and a complete glass cannon, so I just offset the differences with my S3 gear for the most part.  It was still quite healing intensive, and during our 1st attempt I ended up getting gibbed because we didn't realize just how fast we'd have to get away from one another - we ended up killing her on the 3rd try I believe, 1 camp strategy.<br>
<br>
The following week, we managed to hit a bizzarely lucky streak clearing Hyjal and doing trash up to Mother herself, and ended up with something to the effect of 25 hearts; it was asinine.  At that point, everyone in the raid was SR capped, and it absolutely trivialized the fight.  Once you can figure out how to get away from your raid members quickly enough, you will win - plus, it's good training for elements in the Council and Illidan fights too (Blizzard/Flamestrike, Parasites, Flame Crash, ect).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Wikipedia lists a few (rather incomplete) strategies for positioning. Three groups or one group.<br>
We tried for a full two hours using the three group strategy and got her to about 19%<br>
<br>
Three groups setup:<br>
<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px">
	<div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom:0px"><img src="assets/code_html.gif" border="0"></div>
	<pre class="alt2" dir="ltr" style="
		margin: 0px;
		padding: 3px;
		border: 1px inset;
		width: 694px;
		height: 130px;
		text-align: left;
		overflow: auto">Group1
----------------------------------------

            Melee | Boss

---------------------------------------
Group2                  Group3</pre>
</div>Initially this seemed like a good way to do the fight. Beams should affect less players, and if you get an unlucky teleport it should affect only one of the 4 player camps.<br>
This setup proved to be rather ineffective however. There wasn't really any place to run, wherever you went you'd always blow up other people with the 3K/sec AoE. Especially the tanks took a lot of that "running player" Aoe which caused some wipes. And to make things worse, the boss' ability saber lash is 20 yards in front of her and was also killing players.<br>
<br>
We came up with a variation<br>
<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px">
	<div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom:0px"><img src="assets/code_html.gif" border="0"></div>
	<pre class="alt2" dir="ltr" style="

    Melee
----------------------------------------

                 Group2
Group1
---------------------------------------</pre>
</div>This took care of the Saber lash related deaths, but we still had problems with people getting away from other groups in a clean fashion.<br>
<br>
A few people mentioned that the beams did not appear to have a maximum range, so we switched to a single group setup.<br>
<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px">
	<div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom:0px"><img src="assets/code_html.gif" border="0"></div>
	<pre class="alt2" dir="ltr" style="

    Melee                 Group2
----------------------------------------



---------------------------------------</pre>
</div>This resulted in a kill for us after a few attempts.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Points of notice</b><br>
Saber lash only seems to hit the players "behind" the main tank.<br>
If either of the two offtanks are standing in front of the main tank, they will not be affected and the main tank can be killed quite fast.<br>
<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px">
	<div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom:0px"><img src="assets/code_html.gif" border="0"></div>
	<pre class="alt2" dir="ltr" style="

		overflow: auto">OT - OT
   MT
  Boss
  Melee</pre>

</div>You answered your own question here, didn't you? Yes, the OTs need to be engaged with her. It's also possible that your OTs are standing out of position - we've never had any problems with just parking them directly on top of the MT (bears should have the tank somewhere around their front paws).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_697958"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Seriously, if you are still working on Mother Shahraz, just have 2 groups stack up on each other.  One melee group, one ranged dps group.  The entire raid should equip battlemaster's trinkets, and have healthstones and healthpots available.  We put both groups on the same wall so that when people get ported, there is plenty of room to spread out.  If there is a bad port near the melee or ranged group, then everyone simply uses one of their survival cooldowns, the dps bandages back up, and proceed with the fight.<br>
<br>
3 paladin healers on the main tank, 1 resto druid with hots rolling on all 3 tanks, 1 priest and 1 shaman healing people who get ported and raid healing otherwise, 1 shaman chain healing the melee, 1 shaman chain healing the ranged.<br>
<br>
More complicated strategies can often prove to be more effective if everyone performs their jobs correctly, but to minimize the "retard-factor", K.I.S.S (keep it simple stupid) is really the best way to approach new encounters imo.<br>
<br>
Two groups, both on the same wall, stacked up to maximize raid healing and nobody linking the groups in the center.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_701653"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->My guild has a significant "moron factor" a lot of the time. It took us four pulls to kill Shahraz last night. In other words, she died on our 4th try ever. We really should've had it on the first try but someone chained too much damage through the tanks at 30%. <br>
<br>
We used 3 "camps". Right side in front of the tanking area, left side in front of the tanking area, and one group behind melee. We encouraged the teleported healer not to move if they were the only teleported healer. People died.<br>
<br>
This fight is so ridiculously easy compared to almost everything else in BT, including the very easy Supremus, the easier-every-week Akama, etc. etc. If you are really struggling on Shahraz and you've gotten that far, you have almost certainly over-engineered the fight.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>From my experience, the difficulty depends almost entirely on how much SR you have.  Our first partial night of pulls we probably averaged around 250 SR that was hastily crafted up right before the attempts and had a hard time surviving FAs.  On our second night everyone was much closer to capped by adding a few greens and some enchants and it was no problem at all, with only a couple wipes and those caused by tank deaths.  Our strategy was the same as the first night (one ranged camp), but the reduced damage taken made all the difference.<br>
<br>
In response to a post earlier about Tauren tanks, the only problem I had with saber lash was on one pull where she insta-gibbed me.  After that we had the other tanks (an undead warrior and a blood elf pally) be sure to do something to get on her aggro table as she was running over and didn't have any more problems.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>
